FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to membranes for use in combination with implantable devices for evaluating an analyte in a body fluid. More particularly, the invention relates to membranes for controlling the diffusion of glucose therethrough to a glucose sensor. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A biosensor is a device that uses biological recognition properties for the selective analysis of various analytes or biomolecules. Generally, the sensor will produce a signal that is quantitatively related to the concentration of the analyte. In particular, a great deal of research has been directed toward the development of a glucose sensor that would function in vivo to monitor a patient's blood glucose level. Such a glucose sensor is useful in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. In particular, an implantable glucose sensor that would continuously monitor the patient's blood glucose level would provide a physician with more accurate information in order to develop optimal therapy. One type of glucose sensor is the amperometric electrochemical glucose sensor. Typically, an electrochemical glucose sensor employs the use of a glucose oxidase enzyme to catalyze the reaction between glucose and oxygen and subsequently generate an electrical signal. The reaction catalyzed by glucose oxidase yields gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide as shown in the reaction below (equation 1): The hydrogen peroxide reacts electrochemically as shown below in equation 2: [in-line-formulae]H2O2→2H++O2+2e−[/in-line-formulae] The current measured by the sensor is generated by the oxidation of the hydrogen peroxide at a platinum working electrode. According to equation 1, if there is excess oxygen for equation 1, then the hydrogen peroxide is stoichiometrically related to the amount of glucose that reacts with the enzyme. In this instance, the ultimate current is also proportional to the amount of glucose that reacts with the enzyme. However, if there is insufficient oxygen for all of the glucose to react with the enzyme, then the current will be proportional to the oxygen concentration, not the glucose concentration. For the glucose sensor to be useful, glucose must be the limiting reagent, i.e., the oxygen concentration must be in excess for all potential glucose concentrations. Unfortunately, this requirement is not easily achieved. For example, in the subcutaneous tissue the concentration of oxygen is much less that of glucose. As a consequence, oxygen can become a limiting reactant, giving rise to a problem with oxygen deficit. Attempts have been made to circumvent this problem in order to allow the sensor to continuously operate in an environment with an excess of oxygen. Several attempts have been made to use membranes of various types in an effort to design a membrane that regulates the transport of oxygen and glucose to the sensing elements of glucose oxidase-based glucose sensors. One approach has been to develop homogenous membranes having hydrophilic domains dispersed substantially throughout a hydrophobic matrix to circumvent the oxygen deficit problem, where glucose diffusion is facilitated by the hydrophilic segments. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,322,063 to Allen et al. teaches that various compositions of hydrophilic polyurethanes can be used in order to control the ratios of the diffusion coefficients of oxygen to glucose in an implantable glucose sensor. In particular, various polyurethane compositions were synthesized that were capable of absorbing from 10 to 50% of their dry weight of water. The polyurethanes were rendered hydrophilic by incorporating polyethyleneoxide as their soft segment diols. One disadvantage of this invention is that the primary backbone structure of the polyurethane is sufficiently different so that more than one casting solvent may be required to fabricate the membranes. This reduces the ease with which the membranes may be manufactured and may further reduce the reproducibility of the membrane. Furthermore, neither the percent of the polyethyleneoxide soft segment nor the percent water pickup of the polyurethanes disclosed by Allen directly correlate to the oxygen to glucose permeability ratios. Therefore, one skilled in the art cannot simply change the polymer composition and be able to predict the oxygen to glucose permeability ratios. As a result, a large number of polymers would need to be synthesized before a desired specific oxygen to glucose permeability ratio could be obtained. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,777,060 and 5,882,494, each to Van Antwerp, also disclose homogeneous membranes having hydrophilic domains dispersed throughout a hydrophobic matrix to reduce the amount of glucose diffusion to the working electrode of a biosensor. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,882,494 to Van Antwerp discloses a membrane including the reaction products of a diisocyanate, a hydrophilic diol or diamine, and a silicone material. In addition, U.S. Pat. No. 5,777,060 to Van Antwerp discloses polymeric membranes that can be prepared from (a) a diisocyanate, (b) a hydrophilic polymer, (c) a siloxane polymer having functional groups at the chain termini, and optionally (d) a chain extender. Polymerization of these membranes typically requires heating of the reaction mixture for periods of time from 1 to 4 hours, depending on whether polymerization of the reactants is carried out in bulk or in a solvent system. Therefore, it would be beneficial to provide a method of preparing a homogenous membrane from commercial polymers. Moreover, as mentioned above, one skilled in the art cannot simply change the polymer composition and be able to predict the oxygen to glucose permeability ratios. Therefore, a large number of polymers would need to be synthesized and coating or casting techniques optimized before a desired specific oxygen to glucose permeability ratio could be obtained. A further membrane is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,200,772 B1 to Vadgama et al. that has hydrophilic domains dispersed substantially throughout a hydrophobic matrix for limiting the amount of glucose diffusing to a working electrode. In particular, the patent describes a sensor device that includes a membrane comprised of modified polyurethane that is substantially non-porous and incorporates a non-ionic surfactant as a modifier. The non-ionic surfactant is disclosed as preferably including a poly-oxyalkylene chain, such as one derived from multiple units of poly-oxyethylene groups. As described, the non-ionic surfactant may be incorporated into the polyurethane by admixture or through compounding to distribute it throughout the polyurethane. The non-ionic surfactant is, according to the specification, preferably incorporated into the polyurethane by allowing it to react chemically with the polyurethane so that it becomes chemically bound into its molecular structure. Like most reactive polymer resins, complete reaction of the surfactant into the polyurethane may never occur. Therefore, a disadvantage of this membrane is that it can leach the surfactant over time and cause irritation at the implant site or change its permeability to glucose. PCT Application WO 92/13271 discloses an implantable fluid measuring device for determining the presence and the amounts of substances in a biological fluid that includes a membrane for limiting the amount of a substance that passes therethrough. In particular, this application discloses a membrane including a blend of two substantially similar polyurethane urea copolymers, one having a glucose permeability that is somewhat higher than preferred and the other having a glucose permeability that is somewhat lower than preferred. An important factor in obtaining a useful implantable sensor for detection of glucose or other analytes is the need for optimization of materials and methods in order to obtain predictable in vitro and in vivo function. The ability of the sensor to function in a predictable and reliable manner in vitro is dependent on consistent fabrication techniques. Repeatability of fabrication has been a problem associated with prior art membranes that attempt to regulate the transport of analytes to the sensing elements. We refer now to FIG. 1, which shows a photomicrograph at 200× magnification of a prior art cast polymer blend following hydration. A disadvantage of the prior art membranes is that, upon thermodynamic separation from the hydrophobic portions, the hydrophilic components form undesirable structures that appear circular 1 and elliptical 2 when viewed with a light microscope when the membrane 3 is hydrated, but not when it is dry. These hydrated structures can be detected by photomicroscopy under magnifications in the range of between 200×-400×, for example. They have been shown by the present inventors to be non-uniform in their dimensions throughout the membrane, with some being of the same size and same order of dimensions as the electrode size. It is believed that these large domains present a problem in that they result in a locally high concentration of either hydrophobic or hydrophilic material in association with the electrode. This can result in glucose diffusion being limited or variable across the dimension adjacent the sensing electrode. Moreover, these large hydrated structures can severely limit the number of glucose diffusion paths available. It is noted that particles 4 in membrane 3 are dust particles. With reference now to a schematic representation of a known membrane 14 in FIG. 2A, one can consider by way of example a continuous path 16 by which glucose may traverse along the hydrophilic segments 10 that are dispersed in hydrophobic sections 12 of the membrane. For path 16, glucose is able to traverse a fairly continuous path along assembled hydrophilic segments 10 from the side 18 of the membrane in contact with the body fluid containing glucose to the sensing side 20 proximal to sensor 22, where an electrode 24 is placed at position 26 where glucose diffusion occurs adjacent surface 20. In particular, in that portion of the membrane 14 proximal to position 26, glucose diffusion occurs along hydrophilic segments 10 that comprise a hydrated structure 28 having a size and overall dimensions x that are of the same order of magnitude as electrode 24. Therefore, glucose diffusion would be substantially constant across the dimension adjacent electrode 24, but the number of glucose diffusion paths would be limited. Referring now to FIG. 2B, one can consider an example where glucose traversing prior art membrane 14 from side 18 in contact with the body fluid to the sensing side 20 cannot adequately reach electrode 30. In particular, electrode 30 is located at position 34, which is adjacent to a locally high concentration of a hydrophobic region 12 of prior art membrane 14. In this instance, glucose diffusion cannot adequately occur, or is severely limited across the dimension adjacent the electrode surface. Consequently, one would expect that the locally high concentration of the hydrophobic regions adjacent to working electrode 30 would limit the ability of the sensing device to obtain accurate glucose measurements. The random chance that the membrane could be placed in the 2A configuration as opposed to 2B leads to wide variability in sensor performance. We also refer to FIG. 2C, which shows another cross-section of prior art membrane 14. In this instance, glucose is able to traverse a fairly continuous path 36 from side 18 to side 20 proximal to the sensing device. However, electrode 38 is located at position 40 such that glucose diffusion is variable across the dimension adjacent the electrical surface. In particular, most of the electrode surface is associated with a locally high concentration of hydrophobic region and a small portion is associated with hydrophilic segments 10 along glucose diffusion path 36. Furthermore, glucose diffusing along path 36a would not be associated with the electrode. Again, the large non-uniform structures of the prior art membranes can limit the number of glucose diffusion paths and the ability of the sensing device to obtain accurate glucose measurements. It would be beneficial to form more homogeneous membranes for controlling glucose transport from commercially available polymers that have a similar backbone structure. This would result in a more reproducible membrane. In particular, it is desired that one would be able to predict the resulting glucose permeability of the resulting membrane by simply varying the polymer composition. In this way, the glucose diffusion characteristics of the membrane could be modified, without greatly changing the manufacturing parameters for the membrane. In particular, there is a need for homogeneous membranes having hydrophilic segments dispersed throughout a hydrophobic matrix that are easy to fabricate reproducibly from readily available reagents. Of particular importance would be the development of membranes where the hydrophilic portions were distributed evenly throughout the membrane, and where their size and dimensions were on an order considerably less than the size and dimensions of the electrode of the sensing device to allow the electrode to be in association with a useful amount of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic portions. The ability of the membranes to be synthesized and manufactured in reasonable quantities and at reasonable prices would be a further advantage. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides an implantable membrane for controlling the diffusion of an analyte therethrough to a biosensor with which it is associated. In particular, the membrane of the present invention satisfies a need in the art by providing a homogenous membrane with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions to control the diffusion of glucose and oxygen to a biosensor, the membrane being fabricated easily and reproducibly from commercially available materials.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT In order to facilitate understanding of the present invention, a number of terms are defined below. The term “analyte” refers to a substance or chemical constituent in a biological fluid (e.g. blood or urine) that is intended to be analyzed. A preferred analyte for measurement by analyte detecting devices including the membrane of the present invention is glucose. The term “sensor” refers to the component or region of a device by which an analyte can be evaluated. By the terms “evaluated”, “monitored”, “analyzed”, and the like, it is meant that an analyte may be detected and/or measured. The phrase “continuous glucose sensing” refers to the period in which monitoring of plasma glucose concentration is repeatedly performed over short periods of time, for example, 10 seconds to about every 15 minutes. The term “domain” refers to regions of the membrane of the present invention that may be layers, uniform or non-uniform gradients (e.g. anisotropic) or provided as portions of the membrane. Furthermore, the region possesses physical properties distinctly different from other portions of the membrane. The terms “accurate” and “accurately” means, for example, 85% of measured glucose values are within the “A” and “B” region of a standard Clarke Error Grid when the sensor measurements are compared to a standard reference measurement. It is understood that like any analytical device, calibration, calibration validation and recalibration are required for the most accurate operation of the device. The term “host” refers to humans and other animals. In the disclosure that follows, the invention will primarily be referred to in terms of assay of glucose and solutions such as blood that tend to contain a large excess of glucose over oxygen. However, it is well within the contemplation of the present invention that the membrane is not limited solely to the assay of glucose in a biological fluid, but may be used for the assay of other compounds. In addition, the sensor primarily referred to is an electrochemical sensor that directly measures hydrogen peroxide. However, it is well within the contemplation of the present invention that non-electrochemical based sensors that use optical detectors or other suitable detectors may be used to evaluate an analyte. Membranes of the prior art have generally been unreliable at limiting the passage of glucose to implantable glucose sensors. This has presented a problem in the past in that the amount of glucose coming into contact with the immobilized enzyme exceeds the amount of oxygen available. As a result, the oxygen concentration is the rate-limiting component of the reaction, rather than the glucose concentration, such that the accuracy of the glucose measurement in the body fluid is compromised. As described above, in contrast to the present invention, a disadvantage of prior art membranes for regulating analyte transport therethrough has been their tendency to form large undesirable structures (see FIG. 1) that are observable when the membrane is hydrated. In particular, these hydrated structures can be detected by photomicroscopy under magnifications in the range of between 200×-400×, for example. They have been shown by the present inventors to be non-uniform in their dimensions through the membrane, with some being of the same size and same order of dimensions as the electrode size. These large structures have been found to be problematic in that they can result in a locally high concentration of either hydrophobic or hydrophilic material in association with the working electrode, which can lead to inaccurate glucose readings. Moreover, they can greatly reduce the number of glucose diffusion paths available. The membrane of the present invention seeks to circumvent these problems associated with prior art membranes by providing a reliable homogeneous membrane that regulates the transport of glucose or other analytes therethrough, the membrane having (a) a matrix including a first polymer; and (b) a second polymer dispersed throughout the matrix, wherein the second polymer forms a network of microdomains which when hydrated are not observable using photomicroscopy at 400× magnification or less. In one embodiment of the invention, the membrane is substantially free of observable domains. We refer now to FIG. 3, which shows a photomicrograph of a cross-section of a membrane 5 according to the present invention following hydration at two hours. As shown in FIG. 3, the membrane is devoid of any undesirable, large elliptical or spherical structures, such as were observable in hydrated prior art membranes at similar magnifications. It is noted that particles 6 in membrane 5 are dust particles. For purposes of the present invention, it is likely that glucose permeability and diffusion is related to the ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic constituents and their distribution throughout the membrane, with diffusion occurring substantially along assembled hydrophilic segments from the side of the membrane in contact with the host to the sensing side. Referring now to FIG. 4, membrane 42 of the present invention, in accordance with a particular arrangement, is schematically shown having hydrophilic segments 44 dispersed substantially throughout a hydrophobic matrix 46 and presenting a surface 48 to a hydrophilic body fluid. The hydrophilic body fluid contains the sample to be assayed. In one embodiment, the body fluid contains both glucose and oxygen. Membrane 42 restricts the rate at which glucose enters and passes through the membrane and/or may increase the rate at which oxygen enters and passes through membrane 42. While not wishing to be bound by any one theory, it is likely that glucose diffuses substantially along hydrophilic segments 44, but is generally excluded from the hydrophobic matrix 46. It is noted that while the hydrophilic segments 44 are shown as comprising discrete microdomains in FIG. 4, small amounts of hydrophobic polymer may be present therein, particularly at the interface with the hydrophobic matrix 46. Similarly, small amounts of hydrophilic polymer may be present in the hydrophobic matrix 46, particularly at the interface with hydrophilic segments 44. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 4, inventive membrane 42 is shown in combination with a sensor 50, which is positioned adjacent to the membrane. It is noted that additional membranes or layers may be situated between membrane 42 and sensor 50, as will be discussed in further detail below. Diffusion of the sample along paths 52 through membrane 42 into association with a working electrode 54 of sensor 50 causes development of a signal that is proportional to the amount of analyte in the sample. Determination of the analyte may be made by calculations based upon similar measurements made on standard solutions containing known concentrations of the analyte. For example, one or more electrodes may be used to detect the amount of analyte in the sample and convert that information into a signal; the signal may then be transmitted to electronic circuitry required to process biological information obtained from the host. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,757,022, 5,497,772 and 4,787,398 describe suitable electronic circuitry that may be utilized with implantable devices of the present invention. The present invention solves a need in the art by providing a reliable membrane for controlling glucose diffusion therethrough. As shown in FIG. 4, glucose can traverse along hydrophilic segments 44 from the side 48 of the membrane in contact with a body fluid to the side 56 proximal to sensor 50. The hydrophilic microdomains 44 are likely distributed substantially evenly throughout the membrane. Furthermore, these microdomains are likely substantially uniform in size throughout the membrane. The size and order to dimensions of these microdomains is considerably less than the that of the working electrode 54 of sensor 50. As such, the electrode is in association with a useful amount of both the hydrophobic 46 and hydrophilic 44 regions of the membrane to allow effective control over the amount of glucose diffusing to the electrode. Moreover, as shown in FIG. 4, the number of paths available for glucose to permeate the membrane and diffuse from side 48 to the sensing side 56 would be greater for the inventive membrane than for prior art membranes. Consequently, more accurate and reproducible glucose readings are attainable across the entire inventive membrane. FIG. 5 shows a preferred embodiment of the present invention wherein membrane 42 is used in combination with a proximal membrane layer 58 that comprises an enzyme that is reactive with the analyte. In this instance, diffusion of the sample from side 48 through the membrane 42 into contact with the immobilized enzyme in layer 58 leads to an enzymatic reaction in which the reaction products may be measured. For example, in one embodiment the analyte is glucose. In a further embodiment, the enzyme immobilized in layer 58 is glucose oxidase. As described above, glucose oxidase catalyzes the conversion of oxygen and glucose to hydrogen peroxide and gluconic acid. Because for each glucose molecule metabolized, there is proportional change in the co-reactant O2 and the product H2O2, one can monitor the change in either the co-reactant or the product to determine glucose concentration. With further reference to FIG. 5, diffusion of the resulting hydrogen peroxide through layer 58 to the sensor 50, (e.g. electrochemically reactive surfaces), causes the development of an electrical current that can be detected. This enables determination of the glucose by calculations based upon similar measurements made on standard solutions containing known concentrations of glucose. In addition to glucose oxidase, the present invention contemplates the use of a layer impregnated with other oxidases, e.g. galactose oxidase or uricase. For an enzyme-based electrochemical glucose sensor to perform well, the sensor's response must neither be limited by enzyme activity nor cofactor concentration. Because enzymes, including glucose oxidase, are subject to deactivation as a function of ambient conditions, this behavior needs to be accounted for in constructing sensors for long-term use. When the membrane of the present invention is combined with an enzyme layer 58 as shown in FIG. 5, it is the enzyme layer that is located more proximally to the sensor 50 (e.g. electrochemically reactive surfaces). It is noted that enzyme-containing layer 58 must be of sufficient permeability to 1) freely pass glucose to active enzyme and 2) to permit the rapid passage of hydrogen peroxide to the sensor (electrode surface). A failure to permit the rapid passage of glucose to the active enzyme or hydrogen peroxide from the active enzyme to the electrode surface can cause a time delay in the measured signal and thereby lead to inaccurate results. Preferably, the enzyme layer is comprised of aqueous polyurethane-based latex into which the enzyme is immobilized. It is noted that while the inventive membrane 42 may itself contain immobilized enzymes for promoting a reaction between glucose and oxygen, it is preferred that the enzyme be located in a separate layer, such as layer 58 shown in FIG. 5. As described above, it is known that enzyme actively reacting with glucose is more susceptible to irreversible inactivation. Therefore, a disadvantage of providing enzyme in a layer that is semi-permeable to glucose, is that the calibration factors of the sensor may change over time as the working enzyme degrades. In contrast, when enzyme is dispersed throughout a membrane freely permeable to glucose (i.e. layer 58 in FIG. 5), such a membrane is likely to yield calibration factors that are more stable over the life of a sensor. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the first polymer of the membrane includes homopolymer A and the second polymer includes copolymer AB. In another embodiment, the first polymer includes copolymer AB and the second polymer includes copolymer AB. Preferably, the amount of B in copolymer AB of the first polymer is different than the amount of B in copolymer AB of the second polymer. In particular, the membrane may be formed from a blend of two AB copolymers, where one of the copolymers contains more of a hydrophilic B polymer component than the blended targeted amount and the other copolymer contains less of a hydrophilic B polymer component than the blended targeted amount. In yet another embodiment of the invention, the first polymer includes homopolymer A and the second polymer includes homopolymer B. As described above, the invention also provides a polymeric membrane for regulating the transport of analytes that includes at least one block copolymer AB, wherein B forms a network of microdomains which are not photomicroscopically observable when hydrated at 400× magnification or less. In one embodiment, the ratio of A to B in copolymer AB is 70:30 to 90:10. For each of the inventive embodiments herein described, homopolymer A is preferably a hydrophobic A polymer. Moreover, copolymer AB is preferably a hydrophobic-hydrophilic copolymer component that includes the reaction products of a hydrophobic A polymer and a hydrophilic B polymer. Suitable materials for preparing membranes the present invention are described below. For purposes of the present invention, copolymer AB may be a random or ordered block copolymer. Specifically, the random or ordered block copolymer may be selected from the following: ABA block copolymer, BAB block copolymer, AB random alternating block copolymer, AB regularly alternating block copolymer and combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the sensor, membrane, and methods of the present invention may be used to determine the level of glucose or other analytes in a host. The level of glucose is a particularly important measurement for individuals having diabetes in that effective treatment depends on the accuracy of this measurement. In particular, the invention provides a method of measuring glucose in a biological fluid that includes the steps of: (a) providing (i) a host, and (ii) an implantable device for measuring an analyte in a hydrophilic body fluid, where the device includes a polymeric membrane having a matrix including a first polymer and a second polymer dispersed throughout the matrix, wherein the second polymer forms a network of microdomains which are not photomicroscopically observable when hydrated at 400× magnification or less; and a proximal layer of enzyme reactive with the analyte; and (b) implanting the device in the host. In one embodiment, the device is implanted subcutaneously. The invention also provides a method of measuring glucose in a biological fluid that includes the following steps: (a) providing (i) a host, and (ii) an implantable device for measuring an analyte in a hydrophilic body fluid, that includes a polymeric membrane including a matrix including a first polymer and a second polymer dispersed throughout the matrix, wherein the second polymer forms a network of microdomains which are not photomicroscopically observable when hydrated at 400× magnification or less; and a proximal layer of enzyme reactive with the analyte, the device being capable of accurate continuous glucose sensing; and (b) implanting the device in the host. Desirably, the implant is placed subcutaneously in the host. Glucose sensors that use, for example, glucose oxidase to effect a reaction of glucose and oxygen are known in the art, and are within the skill of one in the art to fabricate (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,165,407, 4,890,620, 5,390,671, 5,391,250, 6,001,067 as well as copending, commonly owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/916,858. It is noted that the present invention does not depend on a particular configuration of the sensor, but is rather dependent on the use of the inventive membrane to cover or encapsulate the sensor elements. For the electrochemical glucose sensor to provide useful results, the glucose concentration, as opposed to oxygen concentration, must be the limiting factor. In order to make the system sensitive to glucose concentration, oxygen must be present within the membrane in excess of the glucose. In addition, the oxygen must be in sufficient excess so that it is also available for electrochemical reactions occurring at the amperometric electrode surfaces. In a preferred embodiment, the inventive membrane is designed so that oxygen can pass readily into and through the membrane and so that a reduced amount of glucose diffuses into and through the membrane into contact with an immobilized glucose oxidase enzyme. The inventive membrane allows the ratio of oxygen to glucose to be changed from a concentration ratio in the body fluid of about approximately 50 and 100 parts of glucose to 1 of oxygen to a new ratio in which there is a stoichiometric excess of oxygen in the enzyme layer. Through the use of the inventive membrane, an implantable glucose sensor system is not limited by the concentration of oxygen present in subcutaneous tissues and can therefore operate under the premise that the glucose oxidase reaction behaves as a 1-substrate (glucose) dependent process. The present invention provides a semi-permeable membrane that controls the flux of oxygen and glucose to an underlying enzyme layer, rendering the necessary supply of oxygen in non-rate-limiting excess. As a result, the upper limit of linearity of glucose measurement is extended to a much higher value than that which could be achieved without the membrane of the present invention. In particular, in one embodiment the membrane of the present invention is a polymer membrane with oxygen-to-glucose permeability ratios of approximately 200:1; as a result, 1-dimensional reactant diffusion is adequate to provide excess oxygen at all reasonable glucose and oxygen concentrations found in a subcutaneous matrix [Rhodes, et al., Anal. Chem., 66: 1520-1529 (1994)]. A hydrophilic or “water loving” solute such as glucose is readily partitioned into a hydrophilic material, but is generally excluded from a hydrophobic material. However, oxygen can be soluble in both hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials. These factors affect entry and transport of components in the inventive membrane. The hydrophobic portions of the inventive membrane hinder the rate of entry of glucose into the membrane, and therefore to the proximal enzyme layer while providing access of oxygen through both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic portions to the underlying enzyme. In one preferred embodiment, the membrane of the invention is formed from a blend of polymers including (i) a hydrophobic A polymer component; and (ii) a hydrophobic-hydrophilic copolymer component blended with component (i) that forms hydrophilic B domains that control the diffusion of an analyte therethrough, wherein the copolymer component includes a random or ordered block copolymer. Suitable block copolymers are described above. One is able to modify the glucose permeability and the glucose diffusion characteristics of the membrane by simply varying the polymer composition. In one preferred embodiment, the hydrophobic A polymer is a polyurethane. In a most preferred embodiment, the polyurethane is polyetherurethaneurea. A polyurethane is a polymer produced by the condensation reaction of a diisocyanate and a difunctional hydroxyl-containing material. A polyurethaneurea is a polymer produced by the condensation reaction of a diisocyanate and a difunctional amine-containing material. Preferred diisocyanates include aliphatic diisocyanates containing from 4 to 8 methylene units. Diisocyanates containing cycloaliphatic moieties, may also be useful in the preparation of the polymer and copolymer components of the membrane of the present invention. The invention is not limited to the use of polyurethanes as the hydrophobic polymer A component. The material that forms the basis of the hydrophobic matrix of the inventive membrane may be any of those known in the art as appropriate for use as membranes in sensor devices and having sufficient permeability to allow relevant compounds to pass through it, for example, to allow an oxygen molecule to pass through the inventive membrane from the sample under examination in order to reach the active enzyme or electrochemical electrodes. Examples of materials which may be used to make a non-polyurethane type membrane include vinyl polymers, polyethers, polyesters, polyamides, inorganic polymers such as polysiloxanes and polycarbosiloxanes, natural polymers such as cellulosic and protein based materials and mixtures or combinations thereof. As described above, the hydrophobic-hydrophilic copolymer component includes the reaction products of a hydrophobic A polymer component and a hydrophilic B polymer component. The hydrophilic B polymer component is desirably polyethylene oxide. For example, one useful hydrophobic-hydrophilic copolymer component is a polyurethane polymer that includes about 20% hydrophilic polyethyelene oxide. The polyethylene oxide portion of the copolymer is thermodynamically driven to separate from the hydrophobic portions of the copolymer and the hydrophobic A polymer component. The 20% polyethylene oxide based soft segment portion of the copolymer used to form the final blend controls the water pick-up and subsequent glucose permeability of the membrane of the present invention. The polyethylene oxide may have an average molecular weight of from 200 to 3000 with a preferred molecular weight range of 600 to 1500 and preferably constitutes about 20% by weight of the copolymer component used to form the membrane of the present invention. It is desired that the membrane of the present invention have a thickness of about 5 to about 100 microns. In preferred embodiments, the membrane of the present invention is constructed of a polyetherurethaneurea/polyetherurethaneurea-block-polyethylene glycol blend and has a thickness of not more than about 100 microns, more preferably not less than about 10 microns, and not more than about 80 microns, and most preferably, not less than about 20 microns, and not more than about 60 microns. The membrane of the present invention can be made by casting from solutions, optionally with inclusion of additives to modify the properties and the resulting cast film or to facilitate the casting process. The present invention provides a method for preparing the implantable membrane of the invention. The method includes the steps of: (a) forming a composition including a dispersion of a second polymer within a matrix of a first polymer, the dispersion forming a network of microdomains which are not photomicroscopically observable when hydrated at 400× magnification or less; (b) maintaining the composition at a temperature sufficient to maintain the first polymer and the second polymer substantially soluble; (c) applying the composition at the temperature to a substrate to form a film thereon; and (d) permitting the resultant film to dry to form the membrane. In one embodiment, the forming step includes forming a mixture or a blend. As described above, in preferred embodiments, the first polymer is a polyurethane and the second polymer is polyethylene oxide. In general, the second polymer may be a random or ordered block copolymer selected from the following: ABA block copolymer, BAB block copolymer, AB random alternating block copolymer, AB regularly alternating block copolymer and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the composition comprised of a dispersion of the second polymer within the matrix of a first polymer is heated to a temperature of about 70° C. to maintain the first and second polymers substantially soluble. For example, the combination of a hydrophobic polymer A component and a hydrophobic-hydrophilic copolymer AB component is desirably exposed to a temperature of about 70° C. to maintain the polymer and copolymers substantially soluble. In particular, the blend is heated well above room temperature in order to keep the hydrophilic and hydrophobic components soluble with each other and the solvent. The invention contemplates permitting the coated film formed on the substrate to dry at a temperature from about 120° C. to about 150° C. The elevated temperature further serves to drive the solvent from the coating as quickly as possible. This inhibits the hydrophilic and hydrophobic portions of the membrane from segregating and forming large undesired structures. The membrane and sensor combinations of the present invention provide a significant advantage over the prior art in that they provide accurate sensor operation at temperatures from about 30° C. to about 45° C. for a period of time exceeding about 30 days to exceeding about a year. EXAMPLES Example 1 A Method for Preparing a Membrane of the Present Invention The inventive membrane may be cast from a coating solution. The coating solution is prepared by placing approximately 281 gm of dimethylacetamide (DMAC) into a 3 L stainless steel bowl to which a solution of polyetherurethaneurea (344 gm of Chronothane H (Cardiotech International, Inc., Woburn, Mass.), 29,750 cp @25% solids in DMAC) is added. To this mixture is added another polyetherurethaneurea (approximately 312 gm, Chronothane 1020 (Cardiotech International, Inc., Woburn, Mass.), 6275 cp @25% solids in DMAC). The bowl is then fitted to a planetary mixer with a paddle-type blade and the contents are stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature. Coatings solutions prepared in this manner are then coated at between room temperature to about 70° C. onto a PET release liner (Douglas Hansen Co., Inc., Minneapolis, Minn.) using a knife-over-roll set at a 0.012 inch gap. The film is continuously dried at 120° C. to about 150° C. The final film thickness is approximately 0.0015 inches. Observations of Membrane Using Photomicroscopy at 400× Magnification or Less A ¼″ by ¼″ piece of membrane is first immersed in deionized water for a minimum of 2 hours at room temperature. After this time, the sample is placed onto a microscope slide along with one drop of water. A glass cover slide is then placed over the membrane and gentle pressure is applied in order to remove excess liquid from underneath the cover glass. In this way, the membrane does not dry during its evaluation. The hydrated membrane sample is first observed at 40×-magnification using a light microscope (Nikon Eclipse E400). If air bubbles are present on the top or bottom of the film, the cover glass is gently pressed again with a tissue in order to remove them. Magnification is then increased to 200×; and the hydrated membrane is continuously observed while changing the focus from the top to bottom of the film. This is followed by an increase in magnification to 400×, with the membrane again being continuously observed while changing the focus from the top to bottom of the film. Results Based on the results of an optical micrograph of a sample membrane prepared by using a room temperature coating solution and drying of the coated film at 120° C., the micrograph being captured as described above, it was noticed that both circular and elliptical domains were present throughout the hydrated section of membrane. At the same magnification, the domains were not observable in dry membrane. Giving that in an electrochemical sensor, the electrodes included therein are typically of the same size and same order of dimensions as the observed circular and elliptical domains, such domains are not desired. These domains present a problem in that they result in a locally high concentration of either hydrophilic or hydrophobic material in association with the electrodes. Example 2 Optimizing the Coating Solution Conditions This example demonstrates that preheating the coating solution to a temperature of 70° C. prior to coating eliminates the presence of both the circular and elliptical domains that were present throughout the hydrated cross-section of a membrane prepared using a room temperature coating solution and drying of the coated film at 120° C. Example 2 further demonstrates that, provided the coating solution is preheated to about 70° C., either a standard) (120° or elevated (150° C.) drying temperature were sufficient to drive the DMAC solvent from the coated film quickly to further inhibit the hydrophilic and hydrophobic portions of the polyurethane membrane from segregating into large domains. In particular, the invention was evaluated by performing a coating experiment where standard coating conditions (room temperature coating solution and 120° C. drying temperature of the coated film) were compared to conditions where the coating solution temperature was elevated and/or the drying temperature of the coated film was elevated. Four experimental conditions were run as follows: SS-room temperature solution and standard (120° C.) oven temperature. SE-room temperature solution and elevated (150° C.) oven temperature. ES-preheated (70° C.) solution and standard (120° C.) oven temperature. EE-preheated (70° C.) solution and elevated (150° C.) oven temperature. Results Samples of each of the four membranes listed above were then hydrated for 2 hours, and then observed under the microscope. Performance specifications were achieved when the micrograph of the membrane prepared under a given condition showed an absence of circular and/or elliptical domains that result in an undesirable, discontinuous hydrophilic and hydrophobic membrane structure. Table 1 below summarizes these results where (+) indicates a membrane meeting desired performance specifications and (−) is indicative of a membrane showing the undesirable circular and/or elliptical domains. In summary, for both the ES and EE conditions, where the coating solution was preheated to 70° C. prior to coating on a substrate, no hydrated domains were observed at a 200× magnification. Furthermore, regardless of the drying temperature used for the coated film, when the coating solution was not preheated (conditions SS and SE), the hydrated structures were observed. Therefore, it is likely that preheating the coating solution effectively inhibits the hydrophilic and hydrophobic segments of the polyurethane from segregating into large domains. TABLE 1 Coating Condition Result SS − SE − ES (Inventive) + EE (Inventive) + Example 3 Evaluation of the Inventive Membranes for their Permeability to Glucose and H2O2 Membranes prepared under the EE condition described in Example 2 were evaluated for their ability to allow glucose and hydrogen peroxide to get through the membrane to a sensor. In particular, a series of polyurethane blends of the present invention were generated wherein the percentage of Chronothane H in a coating blend was varied. Furthermore, one of these blends (57.5% Chronothane H in coating blend) was prepared under both the EE condition and the SS condition as described in Example 2. FIG. 6 shows that the sensor output generated with a series of polyurethane blends of the present invention was dependent upon the percentage of the Chronothane H. In particular, the sensor output increased as the percentage of Chronothane H in the coating blend increased. With further reference to FIG. 6, when the percentage of Chronothane H in the coating blend was 57.5%, the sensor output was three times greater for the membrane prepared under the optimized EE coating condition as compared to the non-optimized SS coating condition. Furthermore, FIG. 7 demonstrates that, regardless of the percent Chronothane H in the coating blend, an inventive membrane prepared under the EE condition shows a fairly constant percent standard deviation of sensor output. Moreover, a membrane prepared with 57.5% Chronothane H in the coating blend under the SS condition showed a percent standard deviation of sensor output approximately twice that of an EE membrane prepared with the same percentage of Chronothane H in the blend. It is noted that given that the sensor output is a true measure of the amount of glucose getting through the membrane to the sensor, the results indicate that the permeability of glucose and H2O2 is relatively constant throughout a given inventive membrane prepared under optimized coating conditions (i.e., EE conditions). This is important from a manufacturing standpoint.
