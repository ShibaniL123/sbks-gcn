BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a polymer compound and an organic light-emitting display device having a thin-film encapsulation structure including the polymer compound, and in particular, an organic light-emitting display device having a thin-film encapsulation structure including an inorganic layer and an organic layer including the polymer compound. 2. Description of the Related Art The encapsulation technology for an organic light-emitting display device includes a substrate binding technology in which an encapsulation substrate is bound to a substrate including an organic light-emitting display device and a thin film encapsulation technology in which an encapsulation film is formed in the form of a thin film without use of an encapsulation substrate. The binding of the encapsulation substrate and the substrate including an organic light-emitting display device may be performed using inorganic frits and an organic binding agent. The thin film encapsulation technology may use an inorganic film formed of, for example, AlOx, SiNx, SiOx, or SiON, on a panel. An inorganic film for thin-film encapsulation is thin and highly dense, and due to such characteristics, the inorganic film has barrier characteristics against moisture and oxygen. However, the inorganic film is brittle and thus, shows poor mechanical characteristics when stress is applied thereto. In particular, in the manufacturing process of an organic light-emitting display device, numerous particles are placed on a substrate and when an inorganic film is placed on such particles, it is highly affected by stress. Accordingly, barrier characteristics of the inorganic film may decrease. In response, an organic film is introduced to between the inorganic film and particles to planarize an uneven surface of particles and decrease stress applied to the inorganic film. Herein, the organic film may be formed of an acrylate-based or an epoxy-based material. In the case of an acrylate-based material, an acrylate backbone is variously substituted with a carbonyl group derivative, and polymers are easily formed by radical polymerization. Accordingly, the acrylate-based material is widely used. However, since the acrylate-based material has an aliphatic structure, it has low physical and chemical stabilities, and thus, the structure thereof may easily decompose. In the case of an epoxy-based material, various aromatic groups are substituted with an epoxy group. However, the epoxy-based material has a heavy structure and low film formation efficiency. Accordingly, when the epoxy-based material is formed into a film, it is difficult to control a thickness of the film. Also, during a reaction, the epoxy-based material aggressively reacts and it is difficult to control a polymerization rate. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One or more exemplary embodiments of the present invention may include a polymer compound and an organic light-emitting display device having a thin-film encapsulation structure including the polymer compound that has an easy film-formation control and shows physical and chemical stabilities when stress is applied thereto during processes.

An organic light-emitting device having a stacked structure including a hole transport layer, an emissive layer, an electron transport layer, and a cathode was formed on the ITO glass substrate. Aluminium oxide was vacuum deposited on the organic light-emitting device to form an inorganic layer having a thickness of 10,000 Å. A mixture including Monomer AT (m=12), Monomer C3′ (n=12), Monomer B1′(R5 and R6 are each a hydrogen), and an initiator was deposited on the inorganic layer by flash evaporation and UV curing of the monomers to form an organic layer that had a thickness of 20,000 Å and was formed of the polymer compound (weight average molecular weight (Mw) is 7,000) having the repeating unit of Formula 5. In this regard, a molar ratio of Monomer A2′:Monomer B1′:Monomer C3′ in the mixture was 7:2:1. Silicon nitride was vacuum deposited on the organic layer to form an inorganic layer having a thickness of 10,000 Å to form an organic light-emitting display device. Comparative Example An organic light-emitting display device was manufactured in the same manner as in Example, except that the organic layer was formed by using polyacrylate instead of the polymer compound having the repeating unit of Formula 5. Test The organic light-emitting display devices manufactured according to the Example and the Comparative Example were driven at a temperature of 85° C. in a humidity of 90% and formation of black spots were monitored every 48 hour. FIG. 2 and FIG. 3 are optical microscopic images of an organic light-emitting display device manufactured according to Example and Comparative Example, respectively, 240 hours after driving. As shown in FIG. 2, a plurality of black spots appeared on the organic light-emitting display device manufactured according to Comparative Example, 240 hours after the driving. However, as shown in FIG. 3, a black spot did not appear on the organic light-emitting display device manufactured according to Example, even after the 240 hours of driving. Acrylate, which is used in an organic layer of the related art, may be damaged by plasma during an inorganic layer is formed. For example, as illustrated in the following scheme, thermal decomposition may occur, generating gas, which causes progressive black spots over time as shown in FIG. 2. However, in the case of the polymer compound having the repeating unit of Formula 5, due to the cyclic structure of norbornene structure and a cross-linked bond, thermal decomposition during processes may be suppressed and thus, formation of progressive black spots may be prevented as shown in FIG. 3. An organic light-emitting display device according to embodiments of the present invention may have a thin-film encapsulation structure that has an easy control of a film formation characteristics, stabilities against physical and chemical influences applied thereto during processes, and improved barrier characteristics against moisture and external gas.
