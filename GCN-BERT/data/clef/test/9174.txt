<& i' ,.4 • i." ' Et 10. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. 498G ! Thís invention relates to ne' « or improved means for setting o testing hydraulic shock absorbers or dampers of the type in which damping of relative movement between two parts is effected by the flow of cil or other liquid through one or more valves which are loaded to a predetermined value. In the manufacture and assembly of such saock absorbers or dampers it is desirable to employ means whereby the valve or each valve can be rapidly and accurately set or checked for rate of flow and/ór opening pressure so that uniformity of operation can be ensured, grid the object of my invention is to provide such means. According to my invention raeans for setting or testing hydraulic shock absorbers or dampers, hereinafter called dampers» comprises means for holding a damper and connecting it into a closed circuit for liquid, paeans for adjusting a valve in the damper whìle liquid is passing through it, a power-driven pump or pumps for feeding liquìd through the circuit at a rate of flow substantially greater than the maximum flow which can be passed through the damper, valves for controlling the flow of the liquid in the circuit independently of the damper, and means for indicating or measuring the pressure, r te of flow, and temperature of the liquid at one or more points in the circuit. The liquid in the circuit, which wil! usually be cil, should be maintained at a substantially constant temperature so that the viscosity does not vary appreciably, and _means for controlling the temperature of the cil and for filtering it are conveniently inclined in the circuit. :i i:i1l i .51. i!iill • i:ii• $!:!'11 i ï i!ii•:• 20. b. 10. 15. 25. 30. 35. 40. Preferably the thole of the operations are caused to tal place ín the proper sequence by operation of a single control raember lhioh may also control hydraulic means for clamping the damper. Preferably, also, means are provided for feeding liquid through the damper at two or more predetermined rates of flow. One practical embodiment of ray invention for setting or testing hydraulic shock absorbers or dampers of the direct-acting telescopic type is illustrated by way of example in the accompanyìng drawings in which: Fixture I is a front elevation of the complete apparatus.

A spring-loaded valve arranged in the piston controls the low of cil through the piston in one direction and a valve remote from the gland controls the flow of cil from the cylinder into the recuperation chamber. It is the setting or adjustment of these valves which controls the functioning of the shock absorber. Further lightly loaded valves in the piston and in the 20. closure for the cylinder permit the flow of cil through the piston in the opposite direction and from the recuperation chamber into the cylinder but the loading of these valves does not require adjustment. 25. The apparatus illustrated permits the setting of the control valves-in the piston and in the closure for the cylinder to be adjusted while cil is being circulated through the valve at a predetermined rate of flow and at a substantially constant temperature to elimïnate errors due to variations in the viscosity of the cil. 35. Referring firs to Figure 3 of the drawings, this shows diagran r atically the means for circulating the cil, the circuit through which the cil is fed, the means for holding the damper, and the various gauges and indicators connected to the circuit at different points. m .H iiii: : : ».

A constant speed electric motor (.not shown) coupled to a shaft I0 ,Iriw:s through a gear-box ii two adjustable delivery p,«]mps 12, lõ to which cil is supplied through inlet pipes 14, by a priming pump drawing cil frola a storage tank of subsfiantial capacity and feeding it fo the primps 12 13 through filters. The pumps 12 and 13 respectively supply cil at predetermined rates of flow to separate circuits in which the damper is connected for setting of the valves in the damper piston and in the closure for the cylinder, but as the two circuits are identical only the second is illustrated in Figure 3. The fixtures in which the damper is held in the two circuits differ slightly and these are described in detail hereinafter. The pump 13 delivers cil under pressure into a pipe lõ leading to an hydraulic motor 17 which is coupled to and supplies power to the gear-box ll, and the cil from the exhaust side of the mener is returned to the storage tank by way of a water-cooled heat exchanger which maintains the temperature of the cil ín the circuit substantially constant. The object of the hydraulic motor 1V is to take care of whatever volume of the cil delivered by the pump lõ is surplus to the volume required in the flow circuit and to employ that surplus usefully in providing p owe r • The delivery pipe 18 from the pump is connected by a branch pipe 18 to two pistontype selector valves 19, 20 operated by a co,ninon sliding bar 21 which is actuated by a control lever 22. When the bar 21 is raised an inclined surface 23 on the bar first opens the valve 19 and then after a certain" amenant of lest motion a !second inclined surface 24 opens the valve 20. The rate of move çaent of the lever 22 is controlled by connecting it to the bar 21 through a damper 25 to prevent the valve 20 from being opened too rapidly after the valve 19. i•._ ii •. k j.«.. .. . • -y." - í 631 dhen the vive 19 is opened cil under pressure is supplied through a pípe 26 to hydraulic cylinders 27, 28 for operating clamps at opposite ends of a fíxture 29 in which the damper 30 ís held. o lO. 15. 20. 25. 30. 35. lichen the valve• 20 is opened it supplies oii to a second selector valve 31 which is operated by s lever 32 and is arranged te direct the cil through either of two circuits, a high flow circuit and a low flow circuit. Zach circuit includes a flow control valve 33 and a valve loader õ4 of which the function is to limit the inlet pressure on'the flow control valve to a maximum value over the out-- let pressure. The lever 32 which operates the valve 31 also operates, through a link 35, an output control 36 for the pump 13, and the lever is interlocked by a coupling 37 with the control lever 22 so that the lever 22 cannot be operated to open the valves 19 and 20 unless the lever 32 is in a position corresponding to he selection of the high flow circuit. Through whichever flow circuit is selected the cil is fed through a pipe 38 into the damper by way of one end of the fixture. The cil after passing through the valve in the damper flows by way of a pipe 39 incorporating a visible flow indicator 40 and tb_vough tandem filters 41 and a non-return valve 42 to a flow-meter 43. The rate of flow is indicated by a rotating stroboscopic disc illuminated by a neon lamp 44 in an alternating current circuit, the disc having two concentric rìngs of markings 45 corresponding to two predetermined rates of flow. From the flowmeter the ell returns through a pipe 46 to the valve and from there through a pipe 47 to the storage tank by way of a non-return valve and the cil cooler.

The gauges 52 and 53 are respectively low and high range gauges showing the pressure of the cil entering the damper, both gauges being connected to the pipe 38 by a pipe 54 incorporating a trapped pressure line restriction valve 55. The low range valve is protected by a safety device 56 incorporating a diaphragm and a valve actuated by the diaphragm to prevent the pressure reaching the gauge from exceeding the value permissible on that gauge. 20. 25. 30. All the apparatus illustrated in Figure 3 and described above and the corresponding apparatus to which cil is supplied by the pump 12 are arranged in a casing or cabinet to form a complete unit which has only to be connected to water supply and an electric current supply and can be installed in any convenient position. A practical design o£ cabinet is shown in Figures I and 2 in which t'ne various parts visible have been given the reference numerals used in Figure 3. The lower part or base 60 of the cabinet houses the motor, pumps, cil storage tank and cil cooler, õS. The upper part 61 of the cabinet houses t'ne various gauges, meters and thermometers which are grouped in vertical panels 62, 63 facing the ope fa t or. ,i .,..'J() The fíxtures in which the draperas re held during the settíng of the valves are mounted on the top of the base in front of the pane ls. 6o The gauges 64, 65 between the panels show respectively the cil pressure in the lubrication system of the gear-box and the temperature of the cil leaving the cooler. lO. The rate of flow of water through the cooler is controlled by a hand-wheel 6õ on the front of the cabinet. lõ. The starting and stopping of the motor which drives the pumps are controlled by push buttons 67, 68 above the hand-wheel 663 the main switch and fuse-box 69 being mounted on one side of the cabinet. 20. 25. 30. The level of the cil in the storage tank is shown by a gauge 70 on the front of the base of the cabinet. The flow control valves are housed in the base of the cabinet and access is obtained to them through openings covered by readily detachable plates 71. The fixture which receives the damper during the setting of the valve in the closure for the base of the cylinder is illustrated in Figures 4, 5 and 7. The fixture comprises two main parts and 81. The part 80 is fixed to a base plate 82 while the part 81 is slidably mounted on two parallel longitudinal bars 83 which are fixed at one end in the part 80 by taper pins 84 and at the other end in stationary blocks 85 by taper pins 86. • • i • .

The pegs are carried b opposed pistons 89 working in a transverse double-ended hydraulic cylinder 90 in the base of the part 81, and the pistons are urged part to force the pegs into the holes in t he bars when cil under pressure lO. is admitted to a fitting 91 in the centre of the cylinder. This fitting communicates through a passage 92 in the body of the part 81 with a union 93 which is connected to the pipe-line 26 (Figure 3). 15. 20. 25. 30. The damper which is shown in dotted lines in Figure 4 comprises a cylindrical barrel 94 in which works a piston (not shown) carried by a piston-rod 95 of which the outer end is fixed in a cap 96 having an eye 97 for the connec tion of the piston-rod to a part of a vehicle. The piston-rod works through a gland in a head 98 which is adapted to be secured into one end of the barrel and to be screwed into the open end of a cylindrical reservoir or recuperation chamber which normally closes the cylinder but is not required for the setting operation. The other end of the cylinder :is normally closed by a base fitting 99 containing a spring-loaded valve iaich controls the passage of cil from this end of the cylinder into the recuperation chamber. The setting of this valve is effected by rotating a hexagonal nut on a stem of which the inner end has a hexagonal or other head or has a hexagonal nut fíxed on it. 35. 40. To fit the damper into the fixture for the setting of this valve the head 98 is moved axially on the piston-rod away from the end of the cylinder barrel1 and the base closure 99 is separated from the barrel. e head is received and held in a seating or clamp in the part 80 of the fixture as shown in Figures 4 nd 5. The clamp is divided in a horizontal plane containing the axis of the damper, the lower half of the clamp being fixed and the co-operating upper half heinz in a hinged olo Ió0. :. ii :i -:.:. 1:¢:: .i .; " 'L < ï.• 5. lO. The block is hinged st one side by a pin I0! to the upper end of a vertical spíndole I08 avoidably mounted in a bore in the fixture. On the other side the Flock has wo parallel la Ser Jl pro sections 103 adapted to be engaged by opposite ends of a locking pin 104 mounted in a lever 105 pivoted to rock about a pivot !06 in the upper end of a second vertical spindle 107 slidably mounted in a bore in the fixture. A handle I0 3 on the block I00 extends laterally on one side of and beyond the lever 105. 15° " 20. 25. 30. The lower ends of the spindles are slotted to receive substantially horizontal levers 109 to which the spindles are pivotally coupled by pins Ii0. The levers are fixed at ne end in a transverse shaft iii which forms a fulcrum for them and the Other ends of the levers are connected by a transverse bar 112. At the centre of its length this bar carries an upstaïding rod llõ of which the upper end is engaged by the piston I14 of an hydraulic cylinder i15 which is connected by a union i16 to the pipe-line 26 (Figure 3). i /hen cil under pressure is supplied to the cylinder i15 by the operation of the valve 19 the levers are moved downwardly about their fulcrum and draw the spindles 102 and 107 downwardly to urge the block i00 against the fixed lower part of the clamp and so to clamp the head 98 of the damper in position as shown in Figure 5. The lever 105 is locked in the engaged position by a roller I17 against which bears the head of a spring-loaded plunger ll8 mounted in an axial bore in the spindle 107. 35. 40. ashen the valve 19 is closed and the cylinder 115 is de-energised the spindles i02 and 107 are free to rise and are raised by spring 119 connected between a fixed anchorage and an ar n projecting doyenwardly from the fulcrum shaft Iii. The roller i17 can then press the plunger 118 downwardly and the lever 105 can be swung outwardly on its pivot to free the pin 1Ò4 from the projections on the block I00. ?o" Sa The block can then be swung up on its pivot to release the damper, the b!ock being resiliently retained in the raised position by the engagement with s curved edge on th block of a roller on the upper end of a sprlng-pressed plunger 120 routed in a bore in the spindle 102, lO. A seal is made between the two parts of the clamp by packing strips 121, and further seals 122 surround the head 98 at each end of it. The adjacent end of the cylinder barrel of the damper is received in a seal 123 at the inner end of the clamp. 15. There is thus a sealed space 124 in the clamp around the piston-rod of the draper between the head 98 and the end of the cylínder barrel and this space is in communication with the cylinder barre I. 20. 25. A union 126 connected to the pipe-line 38 (Figure 3) communicates by way of a passage 127 with an inclined drilling in the head 98 which, when the damper is in use, conducts any oll w ich leaks past the piston-rod into the recuperation chamber. Any oll flowing through this drilling during the setting operation is returned into the main flow circuit between the fixture and the flow-meter so that the total flow shown by the meter is the same as under normal working conditions. 30. 3.5. ae space 124 communicates by way of a passage 128 with an air release valve 129 mounted on the top of the block 1O0. Any air present in the cil passes intonate closed left-hand end o£ the valve housing, through a bore 130 in a plunger 151, past a ball 2 which is normally spaced from the end of a rod 13õ fixed in a closure 134 for the other end of the housing, and out to atmosphere through a groove 135 in the closure 134. i :i i i iI i i i ' "<L f A spring ii6 norms J.l holes the plunger in such a posítion that the ball ig2 is clear of s sea6-íng at the ond of the bore 1-50 so bhat air can pass freely, bu'$ if cil passes up into the valve housing it builds up a pressure on the left-hand end of the plunger and moves he plunger to the right against the spring loading so that the bore 130 is closed by the ball 1.52 which abuts against the rod 153 lO. and the cil cannot escape. 15. The other end of the damper cylinder barrel is slidably engaged in an annular seal 140 in a bore in a fitting 141 coupled to the part 81 o£ the fixture. At an intermediate point in its length the barrel is pressed down between two conical rubber gripping raembers 142 which hold it down while the other connections are being made. 20. 25. 55. 40. The base c!osure 99 of the cylinder barrel in which the valve to be set is located is received in an annular seal 14õ in an extension 144 of the part 81 and is held in position against an internal shoulder in the extension by a collar backed by plungers 145 in the fitting 141. The joint between the extension 144 and the fitting 141 is made by an annular seal 14ô. The hexagonal head on the valve stem in the closure is received in a complementary opening in a plate 14V which is urged against the closure by a spring 148. The adjusting nut is engaged by fingers on the inner end of a sleeve 149 coupled to a hollow spindle 150 which extends through a gland 151 and carries a hand-wheel 152 on its outer end. Thus rotation o£ the handwheel rotates the adjusting nut to adjust the loading of the valve in the closure 99. After the setting .has been-ef£ected the fltting 141 is moved away from the part 81 and the closure 99 is pushed out of the extension 144 by a plunger 153 passing axially through the spindle 150 and having a knob on its outer end. • ll. o 10. 4986" i During the setting of the valve cil is fed into the space 154 in the fitting 141 betwóen the end of the barrel and the base closure 99 of the damper, this space ooçr ur ícatlng through a passage 155 with a union 156 connected to the pipe-line 38. After passing through the valve in the closure the ell passes out through a passage 157 to a union 158 which is connected to the pipe-llne 39. The passage 157 has mounted in it a spring loaded non-return valve 159 to prevent cil from the rest of the system dropping back when the damper is taken out of the fixture. 15° 20. Figure 8 shows a further passage 160 connecting the outlet passage 157 with a union 161 to which ís connected a pipe leading to the gauge 49 which shows the outlet pressure. The other fixture in which the damper is held while the valve in the piston is set is illustrated in Figures 8 to ll. Parts identical with parts in the first fixture have been given the same reference numerals. The clamp for the head 98 of the damper is the same as in the other £ìxture and need not be further described. 25. 30. In this case, however, the main cil feed into the damper is into the space 124 in the fixture by way of a passage 162 from a union lõ3 whích is connected to the pipe line from the flow control valve. Another union 164 receives a pipe leading to the pressure gauges which show the inlet pressure, and the bulb of a remote-reading thermometer is inserted into an opening 165. 35. The other end of the cylinder barrel is received in a sealing ring lõ6 at the end of a bore ín the part 81 of the fixture. _ o;i i ... . i . Ji[ 5. lO. 15. The angularly movable part of the adjustable valve in the piston of the damper is engaged by the hexagonal or other end of a plunger 167 which is slldably mounted in an axial bore in a sleeve 168 to which it is coupled by a key 169 and which is ítse].f slidably coupled to a spindle 170. The plunger is urged into engagement with the valve by a spring 171. The spindle 170 extends through a gland 172 in the fixture and has a hand-wh.si 173 on its outer end for rotating it to adjust the valve. After the oil has passed through the valve it leaves the fixture through a passage 174 containing a non-return valve 175 and leading to a union 176. ]'çaen setting the valve in the piston the base closure 99 of the cylinder is of course left off. 20. 25. 30. Setting of either valve can be effected very rapidly and easily. After the damper has been inserted into the approprlate fixture the operator simply has to actuate the control levers in the correct sequence and to watch the flow meter and pressure gauges while he adjusts the valve by means of t'me hand-wheel on the fixture until the pressures on the gauges correspond to those given by preset stationary pointers. Uniformity of setting can thus be readily e nsure d. ............ /ii!ii i/• i: si! / • .í: • .. : ' i ......... )- ' .. f :: :i,: ' õ LA IL'í : l. 49 86 31 Aplmratus for setting ' hydra llc dampers of the kind specified incorporating at least one adjustable valve, comprisŒEn a closed circuit for liquid, means for holding a damper and connectinc ít into said circuit, a power-dríven pump for feeding liquid into the circuit at a rate of flow substantially greater than the maximum rate which can be passed through the damper, ans for adjusting a valve in the damper while liquid is passing through it, means for controlling the flow of liquid in the circuit independently of the damper, and means for indicating the pressure and rate of flow of the liquid at points in the circuit. 2.
