Step 8: (1-Benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl (S)-2-(3-(5-((4-(((tert-butoxycarbonyl)((R)-2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethyl)amino)methyl)-2-chlorobenzamido)methyl)thiophen-2-yl)phenyl)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetate
DMF (4 mL) was added to (R)-4-(((tert-butoxycarbonyl)(2-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)-2-(8-hydroxy-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-5-yl)ethyl)amino)methyl)-2-chlorobenzoic acid (0.154 g, 0.25 mmol), EDCI (0.049 g, 0.24 mmol), HOBT (0.034 g, 0.26 mmol) and 4-DMAP (0.031 g, 0.26 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 5 minutes and then a solution of (1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl (S)-2-(3-(5-(aminomethyl)thiophen-2-yl)phenyl)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetate dihydrochloride (0.122 g, 0.20 mmol) in DMF (1 mL) was added followed by DIPEA (0.142 mL, 0.82 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate and brine. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate evaporated at reduced pressure. The residue was purified by reverse phase column chromatography to afford the title compound (0.18 g, 62%).
