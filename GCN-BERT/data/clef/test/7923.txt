Step 2: Synthesis of methyl 2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)-4-(4-(4'-(morpholinomethyl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)butanoate
To a solution of methyl 4-(4-(4'-formyl-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoate (500 mg, 1 eq) in THF (11 ml) was added with morpholine (0.19 ml, 2 eq) and sodium triacetoxyborohydride (930 mg, 4 eq). The mixture was stirred for 2 hr at room temperature, quenched with sat. aq. NaHCO3, and extracted with dichloromethane and water. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (450 mg, 78%).
