[0006] Myostaiin, a member of the TGF-β super-family, is expressed almost exclusively in skeletal muscle, and acts as a negative regulator of muscle growth (Han 201 1 , Lu 2013, Rennie 2004, Roth 2004, Thomas 2000). Myostatin inhibits myoblast proliferation by causing up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors (e.g., p21), which in turn leads to down-regulation of CDK2 and to GO/Gl cell cycle arrest. In addition, myostatin negatively regulates myoblast differentiation through decreased expression of MyoD, a transcription factor involved in myogenesis (Langley 2002). Therefore, clinical inhibition of myostatin is expected to result in increased muscle size and physical function, and a number of candidate molecules including ΡΓΝΤΑ-745 (Pinta Biotherapeutics), Nina 842 (Nina Biotherapeutics), LY 2935655/Lilly, PF-06252616/Pfizer and REGN-1033 are undergoing evaluation in clinical trials. [0007] Bonetto and colleagues reported that inhibition of JAK/Stat3 signaling blocked muscle wasting in a mouse model of cancer cachexia (Bonetto 2012 ). Zhang and colleagues reported that the transcription factor target of Stat3, CCAAT/enhancer-bindmg protein δ (C/ΕΒΡδ) can bind to the myostatin promoter and increase myostatin transcription (Zhang 2013). They also reported that phosphorylated levels of Stat-3 are increased in muscle biopsies obtained from patients with chronic kidney disease, and mice that model not only chronic kidney disease but also mice that model diabetes. [0008] Alternative treatments of protein energy wasting and related cachexia conditions are few. Increased dietary protein has a limited effect. Despite optimal nutritional intake, the physiological changes in these conditions render it impossible for substantial improvement in patient conditions.

Summary Of The Invention 10017] Disclosed herein are methods of treatment combining administration of a myostatin inhibitor peptibody together with a JAK. inhibitor to achieve additive and synergistic improvement in muscle mass and muscle function in protein energy wasting, cancer cachexia, the cachexia associated with inflammatory conditions and other types of cachexia, e.g., congestive heart failure cachexia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Brief Description of the Several Views of the Drawings [0018] Not applicable. Detailed description of the invention 10019] Described herein are methods of treatment for increasing muscle mass via administration of a combination therapy: a myostatin inhibitor peptibody, Pinta-745 together with a JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib. Also described herein are kits combining a myostatin inhibitor peptibody, Pinta-745 together with a. JAK inhibitor, ruxolitinib and instructions for use. [0020] The methods maximize the effectiveness of therapy to increase muscle size and muscle physical function, resulting in healthful weight gain. [Θ021 ] The combination therapy can be administered to patients affected by protein energy wasting that occurs in end stage renal disease, cancer cachexia, cachexia associated with congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV/AIDs cachexia, and the cachexia associated with chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and related conditions. Drag treatment can improve outcomes such as the incidence and severity of morbidities related to weak muscles such as falls, fractures, and need for assistive devices such as ca es and walkers. In addition, drug treatment will improve survival by preventing inanition from ending a patient's life. [Θ022] The use of inhibitors of both myostatin pathways and JAK pathways will achieve enhanced efficacy at lower doses, from additive or synergistic interactions. In addition, fewer and less significant drug toxicities will result from the use of both agents in combination at these low doses. Definitions 10023] Effective amount. The term "effective amount" refers to an amount of a composition an amount that is effective to ameliorate a symptom of a disease, e.g., muscle wasting. An effective amount can be a therapeutically effective amount or a prophylactically effective amount. An effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic context and objectives. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage levels for treatment will thus vary depending, in part, upon the molecule delivered, the indication, the route of administration, and the size (body weight, body surface or organ size) and condition (the age and general health) of the patient. 10024] Inhibition. The term "inhibition of a protein" refers to a reduction in the activity of a protein, e.g., myostatin, a J'A protein, or a STATS protein. The inhibition can be direct or indirect. The inhibition can be, e.g., via a reduction in the expression level, stability, or activity of the protein, or of the mRNA encoding the protein, [0025] JAK. The term "JAK" refers to the Janus kinase family of intracellular, nonreceptor tyrosine kinases that transduce cytokine-mediated signals via the JAK-STAT pathway Examples include JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYKi , [Θ026] Mammal The term "mammal" as used herein includes both humans and non- humans and includes but is not limited to humans, non-human primates, non-primate mammals, canines, felines, murines, bovines, equines, and porcines. [0027] Muscle wasting. The term "muscle wasting" refers to any amount of muscle atrophy and/or muscle loss in a subject. As used herein the term "cachexia" refers to the condition of accelerated muscle wasting and loss of lean body mass resulting from a number of diseases such as those described herein. [0028] Myostatin. Myostatin, a growth factor also known as GDF-8, is a member of the TGF-β family. Myostatin known to be a negative regulator of skeletal muscle tissue. Myostatin is synthesized as an inactive preproprotein which is activated by proteolyic cleavage (Zimmers et al., supra (2002)). The precursor protein is cleaved to produce an NH2- terminal inactive prodomain and an approximately 109 amino acid COOH-terminal protein in the form of a homodimer of about 25 3d3a, which is the mature, active form (Zimmers et al, supra (2002)). It is now believed that the mature dimer circulates in the blood as an inactive latent complex bound to the propeptide (Zimmers et al, supra (2002)). Full-length myostatm refers to the full-length human preproprotein sequence described in McPherron et al. PNAS USA 94, 12457 ( 1997), as well as related full-length polypeptides including allelic variants and interspecies homologs (McPherron et al. supra (1997)). As used herein the term "myostatin" or "mature myostatm" refers to the mature, biologically active COOH-terminal polypeptide, in monomer, dimer, multimeric form or other form. "Myostatin" or "mature myostatin" also refers to fragments of the biologically active mature myostatin, as well as related polypeptides including allelic variants, splice variants, and fusion peptides and polypeptides. Myostatin may or may not include additional terminal residues such as targeting sequences, or methionine and lysine residues and /or tag or fusion protein sequences, depending on how it is prepared, [Θ029] STAT. The term STAT refers to Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription proteins. STAT proteins play a role in regulation of cell growth, survival and differentiation. The transcription factors of this family are activated by JAK proteins. STAT proteins include ST ATI, STAT2, STAT3, STAT4, STAT5 (STAT5A and STAT5B), and STAT6. [0030] Subject. The term "subject" or "individual" is a mammal. In one embodiment, a subject is a human. [0031] As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms "a," "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Combination therapy [0032] Disclosed herein are methods treating muscle wasting in a subject comprising administering to the subject a first effective amount of anti-myostatin peptibodv PINTA-745 and a second effective amount of ruxolitinib. In some embodiments, the subject is a human, e.g., a human with protein energy wasting due to end stage renal disease. In other embodiments, the subject is a human with cancer cachexia, cachexia associated with congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonar disease, HIV/AIDs cachexia, the cachexia associated with chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and related conditions, and disuse atrophy such as in patients after a hip fracture, or after prolonged hospitalization or after a stroke. [0033] The methods of treatment described herein result in a desirable clinical endpoint. In one embodiment, treatment results in a change from baseline of physical function as measured by the 6MWT (6 minute walk test). In some embodiments, treatment results in an improvement in a lean body mass, a post dialysis body weight (PDW), an incidence rate and duration of medical resource utilization including hospitalization, a serum lipid level, an inflammatory cytokine level, a IL-6 level, a TNF-alpha level, and/or an insulin resistance assessed using the homeostatic model (HOMA-IR). In some embodiments, treatment results in an improvement in a patient reported outcome as assessed using the KDQOL-36 question aire, the FACIT-Fatigue scale, and/or the FAACT anorexia/cachexia subscale. [0034] The two compositions, ΡΓΝΤΑ-745 and mxolitinib, can be administered separately or, alternatively, co -administered. [0035] Dosage, frequency of dosage, and route of administration of the two compositions, PI TA-745 and mxolitinib will depend on the subject. Factors that may be taken into account include the severity of the disease state, the general health of the subject, the age, weight, and gender of the subject, time and frequency of administration, drag combination(s), reaction sensitivities, and response to therapy. [0036] For example, administration can be oral (e.g., for mxolitinib) or through injection (for PINTA-745). In some embodiments, ΡΓΝΤΑ-745 is administered at a dosage of 10 mg/kg, intravenously once a week. In some embodiments, mxolitinib is administered at a dosage of 5 mg orally twice a day. [0037] The length of treatment can be any suitable time that achieves the desired clinical endpoint. In some embodiments, treatment occurs for 24 weeks. Compositions of the invention [0038] Pinta-745 is an anti-myostatin dimeric peptibody disclosed in International application no. PCT/US2003/040781, filed on December 19, 2003 and published as WO/2004/058988. The amino acid sequence of Pinta-745 is found below SEQ ID NO: l.

Examples include b Ruxolitinib which is FDA approved for myelofibrosis. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention [Θ040] The methods of the invention include administering an effective amount of the compositions. The compositions of the invention can be formulated in pharmaceutical compositions. These compositions can comprise, in addition to one or more of the inhibitors, a pharmaceutically acceptable excipieni carrier, buffer, stabiliser or other materials well known to those skilled in the art. Such materials should be non-toxic and should not interfere with the efficacy of the active ingredient. The precise nature of the carrier or other material can depend on the route of administration, e.g. oral, intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous, nasal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal routes. [Θ041 ] Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be in tablet, capsule, powder or liquid form. A tablet can include a solid carrier such as gelatin or an adjuvant. Liquid pharmaceutical compositions generally include a liquid carrier such as water, petroleum, animal or vegetable oils, mineral oil or synthetic oil. Physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide solution or glycols such as ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol can be included. [0042] For intravenous, cutaneous or subcutaneous injection, or injection at the site of affliction, the active ingredient will be in the form of a parenterally acceptable aqueous solution which is pyrogen-free and has suitable H, isotonicity and stability. Those of relevant skill in the art are well able to prepare suitable solutions using, for example, isotonic vehicles such as Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Lactated Ringer's Injection. Preservatives, stabilisers, buffers, antioxidants and/or other additives can be included, as required. [0043] The administration of the compositions is in an "effective amount", this being sufficient to show benefit to the individual. The actual amount administered, and rate and time-course of administration, will depend on the nature and severity of the disease being treated. Prescription of treatment, e.g. decisions on dosage etc, is within the responsibility of general practitioners and other medical doctors, and typically takes account of the disorder to be treated, the condition of the individual patient, the site of deliver}', the method of administration and other factors known to practitioners. Examples of the techniques and protocols mentioned above can be found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th edition, Osol, A. fed), 1 980. A typical dosage may range from about 0. 1 mg/kg to up to about 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In other embodiments, the dosage may range from 0.1 mg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 1 mg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 5 mg/k up to about 100 mg/kg. 15] A composition can be administered alone or in combination with other treatments, either simultaneously or sequentially dependent upon the condition to be treated. 10046] In some embodiments, the compositions of the inv ention include a polypeptide, e.g., an antibody or peptibody, or a polynucleotide. Exemplary sequences are disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the compositions of the invention include a polypeptide or polynucleotide that is less than 100% identical to a amino acid or nucleic acid sequence disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the polypeptide or polynucleotide is 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or between 99 and 100% identical to a sequence disclosed herein. 18] The term "percent identical" in the context of two or more amino acid or nucleic acid sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that have a specified percentage of nucleotides or amino acid residues that are the same, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence, as measured using one of the sequence comparison algorithms described below (e.g., BLASTP and BLASTN or other algorithms available to persons of skill) or by visual inspection. Depending on the application, the percent identity can exist over a region of the sequence being compared, e.g., over a functional domain, or, alternatively, exist over the full length of the two sequences to be compared. 10049] For sequence comparison, typically one sequence acts as a reference sequence to which test sequences are compared. When using a sequence comparison algorithm, test and reference sequences are input into a computer, subsequence coordinates are designated, if necessary, and sequence algorithm program parameters are designated. The sequence comparison algorithm then calculates the percent sequence identity for the test sequence(s) relative to the reference sequence, based on the designated program parameters. [Θ050] Optimal alignment of sequences for comparison can be conducted, e.g., by the local homology algorithm of Smith & Waterman, Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482 (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of eedleman & Wunsch, J. Mol. Biol. 48:443 (1970), by the search for similarity method of Pearson & Lipman, Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. USA 85:2444 (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package, Genetics Computer Group, 575 Science Dr., Madison, Wis.), or by visual inspection (see generally Ausubel et al., infra). [Θ05Ϊ ] One example of an algorithm that is suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity is the BLAST algorithm, which is described in Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 (1990). Software for performing BLAST analyses is publicly available through the National Center for Biotechnology Information (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). Variants [Θ052] The compositions described herein also encompass variants of the polypeptides described herein. As used herein, the term "variants" refers to polypeptides having one or more amino acid residues inserted, deleted or substituted into the original amino acid sequence and which retain at least a portion of the function of the polypeptide described herein. As used herein, fragments of the polypeptides are included within the definition of "variants". It is understood that any given peptide or peptibody may contain one or two or all three types of variants. Insertional and substitutional variants may contain natural amino acids, as well as non-naturally occurring amino acids or both. Variants can include, e.g., polypeptides that include a leader or signal sequence; polypeptides with additional amino terminal residues, e.g., Met! or Lys 2; polypeptides with expression tags, e.g., histidine tags; and polypeptides expressed as fusion proteins. 10053] Variants of the polypeptides described herein can include amino acid substitutions. Stereoisomers (e.g., D-amino acids) of the twenty conventional (naturally occurring) amino acids, non-naturally occurring amino acids such as a~, a-disubstituted amino acids, N-aikyi amino acids, lactic acid, and other unconventional amino acids may also be suitable components for polypeptides of the present invention. Examples of non-naturally occurring amino acids include, for example: aminoadipic acid, beta-alanine, beta- aminopropionic acid, aminobutyric acid, piperidinic acid, aminocaprioic acid, aminoheptanoic acid, aminoisobutyric acid, aminopimelic acid, diaminobutyric acid, desmosine, diaminopimelic acid, diaminopropiomc acid, N-ethylglycine, N-ethylaspargine, hyroxylysine, allO-hydroxyiysine, hydroxyproline, isodesmosine, allo-isoleucine, N- methylglycme, sarcosine, N-methylisoleucine, N-methylv aline, norvaiine, norleucine, orithine, 4- ydroxyproline, γ-carboxyglutamate, ε-Ν,Ν,Ν-trimethyllysine, ε-Ν-acetyllysine, O-phosphoserine, N-acetylserine, N-formylmethionine, 3 -methylhistidine, 5 -hydroxy lysine, σ-Ν-methylarginine, and other similar amino acids and amino acids (e.g., 4-hydroxyproline). [0054] Naturally occurring residues may be divided into (overlapping) classes based on common side chain properties: |0055] 1) neutral hydrophobic: Met, Ala, Val, Leu, He, Pro, Tip, Met, Phe; [0056] 2) neutral polar: Cys, Ser, Thr, Asn, Gin, Tyr, Gly; [0057] 3) acidic: Asp, Glu; [0058] 4) basic: His, Lys, Arg; [0059] 5) residues that influence chain orientation: Gly, Pro; and [0060] 6) aromatic: Tip, Tyr, Phe. [0061] Substitution with naturally occurring amino acids can be conservative or non- conservative. Conservative amino acid substitutions involve exchanging a member of one of the above classes for another member of the same class. Conservati ve changes may encompass unconventional amino acid residues, which are typically incorporated by chemical peptide synthesis rather than by synthesis in biological systems. These include peptidomimetics and other reversed or inverted forms of amino acid moieties. Examples [Θ062] Below are examples of specific embodiments for carrying out the present invention. The examples are offered for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention in any way. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers used (e.g., amounts, temperatures, etc), but some experimental error and deviation should, of course, be allowed for. [0063] The practice of the present invention will employ, unless otherwise indicated, conventional methods of protein chemistry, biochemistry-, recombinant DNA techniques and pharmacology, within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature. See, e.g., T.E. Creighton, Proteins: Structures and Molecular Properties (W.IT, Freeman and Company, 1993); A.L. Lehninger, Biochemistry (Worth Publishers, Inc., current addition); Sambrook, et al., Molecular Cloning: A. Laboratory Manual (2nd Edition, 1989); Methods In Enzymology (S. Colowick and N.

Exampie 1; Preclinical exam pie of JA -STAT3 and myostatic pathway interaction, 10064] Muscle wasting is a common feature of End Stage Renal Disease, which is accompanied by up-regulation of myostatm, a member of the TGF-beta super- family that is expressed in muscle and acts as a negative regulator of muscle growth. End Stage Renal Disease is also accompanied by up-regulation of STATS, the downstream signal transducer of JAK family kinases, and a small molecule inhibitor of STAT3 reduces the muscle loss accompanying renal dysfunction in a mouse model (Zhang et al, 2013). [Θ065] PINTA 245 (the mouse version of PINTA-745, PINTA-745/Mu-S) is a peptibody that has been genetically engineered to neutralize myostatin. It is comprised of an Fc domain from mouse IgG to limit anti-drug antibody responses in a mouse model, fused to an anti- myostatin peptide. The sequence of a monomer of Pinta-245 is as follows: MDKTHTCPPC PAPELLGGPS VFLFPPKP?

Ruxolitinib has been approved by the US FDA in November 2011 for the treatment of myelofibrosis. [0067] The present study examines the pharmacological effect of PINTA-745/Mu-S in combination with ruxolitinib on body weight, muscle mass, inflammatory biomarkers and survival in 5/6* nephrectomized mice, a mouse model of chronic kidney disease. [Θ068] Methods: 12 week old C57BL/6 mice undergo subtotal nephrectomy in 2 stages (Zh ang et al, 20 1). First, 70% of the right kidney is resected, and mice are fed 12% protein to minimize mortality from uremia. Seven days later, the left kidney is removed, and 2 weeks later, mice are fed a 40% protein diet (Harlan Teklab, Indianapolis, IN, USA) to induce advanced chronic kidney disease. Sham-treated control mice underwent surgery without damaging the kidneys and are fed the same diets. Mice are paired on the basis of body weight and blood urea nitrogen for assignment to treatment and control (PBS) groups. [0069] ΡΓΝΤΑ-745/Mu-S is injected subcutaneously at 5mg/kg into one of the paired CKD mice every other day for 56 days; the other paired mouse is injected with an equal amount of PBS (as control). Additional subgroups receive oral ruxolitinib (Incyte, Wilmington, DL, USA) 60 mg kg by daily gavage, or an equivalent weight of vehicle (cellulose, lactose, magnesium stearate). 0070] The treatment schedule is indicated in the table below: [0072] M uscle weights and microscopic characteristics of tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius and soleus muscles are examined at sacrifice. Sections are immunostained with anti-laminin and DAPI to assess myofiber sizes. 10073] Mouse grip strength is measured daily for 4 consecutive days using a Grip Strength Meter (Columbus Instniments). Each day, 5 grip strengths are assessed at 1 mm intervals, and the average grip strength over 4 days is calculated. [0074] To assess protein synthesis and degradation, isolated extensor digitorum longus muscles are maintained at resting length and incubated in Krebs-Henseieit bicarbonate buffer with 10 mM glucose. Protein synthesis is measured as the rate of incorporation of 1- [l4C]phenylalanine and protein degradation as the release of tyrosine. These amino acids are selected as they are not metabolized by muscle tissue. [0075] Serum proteins (n=58; Rodent Multi-Analyte Profile version 2.0) are quantified by a multiplex immunoassay (Rules Based Medicine, inc., Austin, TX, USA). [0076] Animals are monitored by a blinded laboratory staff member trained in humane animal care procedures in accordance with institutional animal care and use committee guidelines. The statistical difference between groups is assessed with pair-wise AN OVA testing at the landmark time of 3 weeks. Results: [0077] PI TA-745/Mu-S monotherapy treated CKD mice gain significantly more body weight; these weight gains are similar to those observed in normal control mice. Likewise, ruxolitinib treated CKD mice gain significantly more body weight. The combination of PINTA-745/Mu-S and ruxolitinib leads to at least additive effects on body weight. [0078] Muscle weights are increased by each monotherapy, and at least additive additional increase in muscle bulk is observed during combination therapy with ΡΓΝΤΑ- 745/Mu-S and Ruxolitinib. Muscle fiber cross sectional areas are additionally increased by the combination therapy over monotherapy. [0079] Grip strength is increased. [0080] There is a significant improvement in muscle protein synthesis and a decrease in muscle protein degradation with each monotherapy, with significant additional efficacy observed when 745/Mu-S and raxoiitinib are combined. [0081] Inflammatory cytokines induced by chronic kidney disease are generally suppressed by treatment with anti-myostatin peptibody PINTA-745/Mu-S, and with JAK inhibitor ruxoiitinib. In addition, the combination of anti-myostatin and ruxolitinib led to additional efficacy in suppressing inflammation. The percentage of animals surviving at six weeks is significantly improved by either monotherapy and the combination therapy. 10083] A randomized, blinded, placebo controlled clinical trial is designed to test the safety and efficacy of ΡΓΝΤΑ-745 and ruxoiitinib versus PI TA-745 monotherapy in protein energy wasting. [0084] All ( =80) subjects received 24 weekly doses of PINTA-745 1 Omg/kg IV. Subjects are randomly assigned 1 : 1 to either blinded ruxoiitinib 5mg PO twice daily (N= 0) or placebo PO twice daily (N=40). [Θ085] The primary efficacy endpoint is percent change from baseline in physical function as measured by the 6MWT (6 minute walk test) at 24 weeks in the group receiving combination therapy compared to the group receiving monotherapy. The secondary efficacy endpoints included percent change in lean body mass, post dialysis body weight (PDVV), the incidence and duration of medical resource utilization including hospitalization, the percent change relative to baseline in biomarkers including seram lipids, inflammatory cytokines IL- 6, T F-alpha, and change in insulin resistance assessed using the homeostatic model (HOMA-IR). Changes in patient reported outcome measures are assessed using the KDQOL- 36 questionnaire, the FACIT-Fatigue scale, and the FAACT anorexia/cachexia subscale. Primary endpoint: [0086] Combination therapy PINTA-745 and ruxoiitinib meet the primary endpoint of change from baseline in 6MWT distance at week 24. The combination group demonstrates a statistically significant improvement on repeated measures ANCOVA analysis compared to 745 plus placebo group. [0087] A responder analysis is performed, defining a response as an improvement of 10% increase over baseline. The combination group demonstrates a statistically significant improvement in the proportion of responders compared to the 745 plus placebo group. Secondm endpoints; [Θ088] Combination therapy PINTA-745 and ruxolitinib improves lean body mass more than monotherapy with PINTA-745. In some embodiments at least one of the following endpoints is also met, • Improved lean body mass is durable with the effect maintained at the time of a follow up visit 1 month after the final dose. • Post-dialysis weight is improved by the combination. • Medical resource utilization is lower in the combination therapy arm. • Fewer falls, fractures and cardiovascular adverse events (coded using a standardized MeDR term including myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and arrhythmia) occurred in the combination therapy arm as compared to the monotherapy arm. • Biomarker analysis demonstrates that the combination therapy- improves inflammation. • Quality of life is improved by combination therapy particularly in domains related to physical function. • Overall survival is improved by combination therapy. [0089] While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment and various alternate embodiments, it will be understood by persons skilled in the relevant art that various changes in form and details can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of t he in vention. 10090] All references, issued patents and patent applications cited within the body of the instant specification are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety, for all purposes. 1.
