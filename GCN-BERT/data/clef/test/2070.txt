Step 3
5- (Benzyloxy)-3-hydroxy-N-methoxy-N-methylpentanamide
A solution of ethyl 5-(benzyloxy)-3-hydroxypentanoate (3.20 g, 12.7 mmol) and N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (3.02 g, 31.8 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) was slowly added dropwise to the isopropylmagnesium chloride (2 M tetrahydrofuran solution, 44.0 mL, 57.2 mmol) at -10°C under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction solution was slowly warmed to 0°C and stirred for 3 hours. The reaction was then quenched with ammonium chloride solution (50 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL x 3). The organic phases were combined, washed with brine (10 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by silica gel column chromatography (5:1 petroleum ether: ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.2) to give 5-(benzyloxy)-3-hydroxy-N-methoxy-N-methylpentanamide (2.50 g, as a yellow oil) with a yield of 74%.
