[Step 4] Synthesis of tert-butyl 3-((2-fluoro-4-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzyl)(phenyl)carbamoyl)azetidine-1-carboxylate
Tert-butyl 3-((2-fluoro-4-(2-(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)hydrazine-1-carbonyl)benzyl)(phenyl)carbamoyl)azetidine-1-carboxylate (1.400 g, 2.600 mmol), synthesized in step 3, and 1-methoxy-N-triethylammoniosulfonyl-methanimidate (Burgess reagent, 0.929 g, 3.900 mmol) were mixed in tetrahydrofuran (100 mL) at room temperature. The mixture was heated at reflux for 12 hours, and then cooled down to room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 80 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 10% to 30%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.800 g, 59.1%) as a white solid.
