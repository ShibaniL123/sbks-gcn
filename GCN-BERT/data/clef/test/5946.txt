bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-ylmethanol
To a solution of bicyclo[1.1.1]pentane-1-carboxylic acid (4.0 g, 35.7 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (89 mL) at 0° C. was added lithium aluminum hydride (1.801 g, 47.4 mmol) in portions and the reaction bubbled vigorously. The reaction was warmed to 24° C. and was stirred for 16 hours. The reaction was cooled in an ice bath and 4 g of sodium sulfate decahydrate was added in portions and the reaction was stirred for 1 hour. Aqueous NaOH solution (15%, 2 mL) was added, the reaction mixture was stirred for 0.5 hours, water (2 mL) was added, the ice-bath was removed and the mixture was stirred for 2 hours. The mixture was dried with 40 g anhydrous sodium sulfate. The suspension was filtered and the filtrate was washed with ether. The solvent was removed in vacuo to provide crude bicyclo[1.1.1]pentan-1-ylmethanol (3.2 g, 32.6 mmol, 91% yield).
