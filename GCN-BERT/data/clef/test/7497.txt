Step 1: Preparation of methyl 3-bromo-4-methoxybenzoate
To a solution of methyl 4-methoxybenzoate (1.5 g, 9 mol) dissolved in water (10 mL), potassium bromate (251 mg, 1.5 mmol) and liquid bromine (722 mg, 4.5 mmol) were slowly added at room temperature. The reaction system was stirred for 2.5 hrs while the temperature was maintained below 30Â°C. The reaction system was added with methyl t-butyl ether (25mL), and extracted. Then, the organic phase was washed with saturated saline, dried and concentrated. The resulting residue was separated by flash column chromatography (petroleum ether:ethyl acetate=10:1) to obtain Compound d': methyl 3-bromo-4-methoxybenzoate as a white solid (2.1 g, yield 95%).
