BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to attachment surfaces, straps and bands. The present invention relates more specifically to an attachment surface structured to allow identical sections of the surface to removably attach together. 2. Description of the Related Art Efforts have been made in the past to provide surfaces (most often in the form of straps or bands) that removably and repeatedly adhere to each other for the purpose of securing one object to another. One example of such types of surfaces is a hook surface operable in conjunction with a loop surface, developed and marked under the brand name Velcro®. Hook and loop surfaces suffer from a number of drawbacks. Both surfaces tend to collect fibrous dust, strings, and other material that fowls the surfaces and degrades their ability to adhere to one another. A further disadvantage of hook and loop surfaces is the requirement to manufacture and sell two different types of surfaces rather than a single type of surface that can adhere to another section of the same type of surface. It would be desirable to have attachment surfaces that overcame the problems associated with the more common hook and loop combination surfaces. It would be desirable if a single type of surface could be manufactured and two sections of the single type of surface would adhere to each other. It would be desirable if the surfaces were not prone to become fowled with fibers, dust, threads, and other materials that might degrade their function. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In fulfillment of the above objectives the present invention provides a number of attachment surface structures that find their best use in the form of repeatedly removable straps and bands for securing one object to another. The surfaces are preferably constructed of narrow sheets of flexible polymer plastic materials having generally high tensile strength (bendable but not stretchable). A first set of embodiment includes shaped parallel ridges on one face of strap or band that interlock with mating parallel ridges on an opposing strap or band. These parallel ridges may be double sided (interlocking on both sides of each shaped ridge with the next shaped ridge on either side) or single sided (interlocking with a single ridge oriented 180 degrees from the first). A second set of embodiments includes an array of “umbrella” shaped posts that interlock with an opposing array of identical posts on a second section of strap. The second set of embodiments may be constructed using a variety of regular geometric shapes (square, triangle, pentagon, and hexagon, for example) that permit adherence between the surfaces in other than laterally aligned orientations.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Reference is made first to FIG. 1 which is a detailed cross-sectional view of a double sided embodiment of the attachment surfaces system of the present invention. The cross section shown in FIG. 1 represents the structure of both a double sided ridge based embodiment and a double (or multiple) sided post embodiment. The structure could, for example reflect a cross section of the embodiment shown in FIG. 5 (square post array) as viewed along Section Line A-A′ therein, as well as a double sided parallel ridge embodiment. In either case the flexible material from which the generally flat straps or bands 12 & 14 are constructed to allow the ridges (or posts) 16 from one surface to press into and interlock with the same ridges (or posts) present on an opposing strap or band. This interlock is achieved between what are essentially the same structures positioned in opposition to each other. In FIG. 1 these structures represent arms 18 & 20 extending off of ridge (or post) 16 that interlock with corresponding arms positioned on the opposing strip. This interlock maintains adherence between the surfaces, especially in the face of longitudinal force. The surfaces may separate relatively easily with a transverse rolling force (see FIG. 4) when the user wants to separate the surfaces. FIG. 2 is a detailed cross-sectional view of a single sided embodiment of the attachment surfaces system of the present invention, essentially eliminating one interlocking side of each parallel ridge. In FIG. 2, flat straps or bands 22 & 24 are constructed to allow the ridges (or posts) 26 from one surface to press into and interlock with the same ridges (or posts) present on an opposing strap or band. In this embodiment, a single curled arm 28 extends from ridge (or post) 26 to interlock with a corresponding curled arm from the opposing strap or band. The embodiment shown in FIG. 2 retains the strength of adherence by increasing the degree to which the ridges interlock. While this maintains the hold between the surfaces in one direction it does reduce the hold in the opposing direction. This characteristic may be beneficial where the desire is to secure a strap or band pulled in one direction from being released in the opposite direction. This would be helpful where, for example, a strap is used to tighten or close one component over and against another, such as in a shoe or a tie down, where an opposing force is oriented in the direction that the surface to surface adherence is strongest. The cross section view of FIG. 2 best represents the parallel ridge structure shown in FIGS. 3 & 4, as viewed along Section Line B-B′ in FIG. 4. Again, orientation of the straps 22 & 24 is such that the force that tends to longitudinally pull the straps apart is most strongly resisted by the interlocking structure. The flexibility of the interlocking “arms” 28 (seen in cross section) on each ridge 26 allows for the structures to coil together as shown in FIG. 2. Pulling the straps 22 & 24 apart (in a direction orthogonal to the surfaces) allows these interlocking structures to uncoil and release. Once again, one of the most important features of the present invention is the identical structure of the two opposing surfaces 22 & 24. FIG. 3 is a top plan view of two opposing straps 30 & 32 implementing the parallel ridge 34 embodiment of the attachment surfaces system of the present invention, the straps 30 & 32 shown separated before attachment. The lower strap 32 (oriented with the rounded end to the left) shows the parallel ridges 36 on its upper face. The upper strap 30 (oriented with the rounded end to the right) shows the hidden parallel ridges 34 in broken line form for purposes of viewing how the ridges 34 & 36 align and interlock. Reference is again made to FIG. 2 for the best representation of this interlocking action. The arrows in FIG. 3 show the manner in which the straps 30 & 32 may be pressed together to achieve the interlocking action. FIG. 4 is a top plan view of the two opposing straps 30 & 32 implementing the parallel ridge embodiment shown in FIG. 3; the straps 30 & 32 shown overlaid and attached one to the other. The curved arrow in FIG. 4 shows the manner in which the top strap 30 may be pulled up and back so as to release the interlocking structures and separate the straps. Adjustment of the longitudinal tightness of the straps may be made by pulling one strap further along the other, incrementally moving to the next ridges on the second strap for each of the parallel opposing ridges on the first strap. In this manner, the strength of the longitudinal force (the tightness) may be incrementally increased or decreased. Reference is next made to FIGS. 5 & 6 for a description of an alternate post array embodiment of the present invention. Whereas the parallel ridge embodiment lends itself to strength of attachment when one strap is oriented parallel to the other (directly overlaying), the post array embodiment allows for non-aligned orientation of the straps. FIG. 5 is a top plan view of one strap 40 implementing the post array 44 (square) embodiment of the attachment surfaces system of the present invention, a second opposing strap 42 shown in broken line form to show the multiple orientations possible with the embodiment. With each “umbrella” shaped post 44 (seen from the top in this view) having four interlocking structures (oriented outward 90 degrees to each other) a similar surface may interlock into an opposing space 46 in either a longitudinal or a transverse orientation (as shown in broken line form). Although a strap implementation of this embodiment is shown in FIG. 5, the post array embodiment lends itself to implementation with larger patches of attachment surfaces that may serve to secure more than one strap, possibly oriented in two directions. FIG. 6 is a top plan view of one strap 50 implementing the post array 54 (triangular) embodiment of the attachment surfaces system of the present invention, a second opposing strap 52 shown in broken line form to show the multiple orientations possible with this embodiment. With a triangular post structure 54 the attachment orientation may be in 60 degree rotations as shown with respect to an opposing space 56. Here again, although a strap implementation of this embodiment is shown in FIG. 6, the post array embodiment lends itself to implementation with larger patches of attachment surfaces that may serve to secure more than one strap, possibly oriented in two or more different directions. A single larger circular patch of material could, for example, receive and secure three separate straps coming together from three different directions (generally at 60 degrees of rotation from each other). Implementation of the post array embodiment of the present invention may be made also with other regular geometric structures, most notably with hexagonal post configurations. Increasing the number of sides does however decrease the length of each interlocking grip thereby diminishing somewhat the strength of the hold. Nonetheless there are likely applications where increased options with regard to orientation are preferred over the strength of the hold. FIGS. 7A-7D are an isometric view and three orthographic views of a further embodiment of the present invention showing a connector top 70 with attachment slots 72 and alignment bar 74. FIGS. 8A-8D are an isometric view and three orthographic views of a corresponding connector bottom 80 mateable to the connector top 70 shown in FIGS. 7A-7D. In this embodiment, attachment slots 72 & 82 are shown in each component 70 & 80 for attaching the components to the materials to be connected (such as straps, panels, or the like). In this embodiment, parallel ridges 76 are positioned on connector top 70 and comprise paired ridges 76 with opposing, inwardly directed, pointed edges as shown in FIG. 7B. These paired ridges 76 interlock with ridges 86 on opposing connector bottom 80. Ridges 86 comprise single walled ridges with caps having opposing pointed edges that engage with the inwardly directed pointed edges of paired ridges 76. Additionally, alignment bars 74 & 84 are disclosed on components 70 & 80 to facilitate the aligned mating of the connector component ridges 76 & 86. FIGS. 9A-9D are an isometric view and three orthographic views of a further embodiment of the present invention showing a connector top 90 designed to be sewn onto a substrate to be connected. FIGS. 10A-10D are an isometric view and three orthographic views of a corresponding connector bottom 100 mateable to the connector top 90 shown in FIGS. 9A-9D. In this embodiment, each component 90 & 100 is sewn onto the materials to be connected (such as straps, panels, or the like). Ridges 96 shown in FIG. 9B on connector top 90 are essentially the same as those shown in FIGS. 7A-7D. Likewise, ridges 106 shown on connector bottom 100 are essentially the same as those shown on connector bottom 80 in FIGS. 8A-8D. FIGS. 11A-11D are an isometric view and three orthographic views of a further triangular snap connector embodiment showing strap 110 with the inner connector half 116. FIGS. 12A-12D are an isometric and three orthographic views of a corresponding strap 120 with outer connector half 126 mateable to the inner connector half 116 shown in FIGS. 11A-11D. With the triangular version shown, the inner and outer halves 116 & 126 may be aligned at 0°, 60°, or 300° (−60°) with respect to each other and still form a secure attachment. This triangular structure may be extended to six sided or eight sided connector structures that will mate at several regular angles. FIG. 13 is a side edge view showing the manner of attachment between the top 130 and bottom 132 components shown in FIGS. 9A & 10A (for example). A similar manner of attachment is applicable to the top and bottom components shown in FIGS. 7A & 8A, although the additional attachment slots and alignment bars therein would be visible. Ridges 134 in top component 130 provide the opposing pair ridges with inwardly directed pointed edges that surround and engage with post ridges 136 on bottom component 132 that include outwardly directed pointed edges. Reference is next made to FIGS. 14A-14C, FIGS. 15A-15C, FIGS. 16A-16C, and FIGS. 17A-17C for a description of a further alternate embodiment of the present invention capable of being manufactured using an extrusion process. FIG. 14A is a cross-sectional view of an extrusion of plastic material configured with five rows of post-type ridges, viewed along Section Line C-C′ in FIG. 14C. Connector bottom component 140 comprises a flat substrate 142, preferably on the order of one inch in width, although larger and smaller sizes are envisioned and possible, that supports (in this example) five post-type ridges 144a-144e. A detailed view (Detail A from FIG. 14A) of one of these post-type ridges 144 is shown in FIG. 14B. Positioned on substrate 142 is post section 148 (essentially a raised ridge that appears as a post in this cross-sectional view) that includes cap 145 having a pair of outwardly directed pointed edges 146. Edges 146 comprise rounded pointed edges to facilitate the latching and unlatching of the ridge from the opposing component described below. FIG. 14C is a top plan view of a section of extruded bottom component 140 showing each of the five (in this example) ridges 144a-144e. Those skilled in the art will recognize how the described structure lends itself to manufacture by extrusion techniques. FIGS. 15A-15C represent a section of the extrusion shown in FIGS. 14A-14C cut and modified to be used as a connector component. Bottom connector component 150 is shown to be structured on a section of substrate 152 with a number of attachment apertures 154 drilled or molded therein. Parallel post-type ridge sections 156a-156e are shown in a top plan view in FIG. 15B. FIG. 15C provides a perspective view showing both the arrangement of post-type ridge sections 156a-156e on substrate 152, as well as the placement of the plurality of apertures 154 drilled or molded into section of connector 150. FIG. 16A is a cross-sectional view of an extrusion of plastic material configured with four rows of paired opposing ridges, viewed along Section Line D-D′ in FIG. 16C. Connector top component 160 comprises a flat substrate 162, preferably on the order of one inch in width, although larger and smaller sizes are envisioned and possible, that supports (in this example) four paired ridges 164a-164d. A detailed view (Detail B from FIG. 16A) of one of these pairs of opposing ridges 164 is shown in FIG. 16B. Positioned on substrate 162 are first and second opposing ridge walls 165 & 167. A blocking turret 166 is positioned between the first and second opposing ridge walls 165 & 167 to prevent that paired ridge row from impinging itself onto the ridge rails of the opposing part. In this manner the pointed edges of the respective ridges will always slide properly into the opposing part so that the pointed edges of the post ridge grasp the rail ridges of the opposing part. Angled edges 161 & 163 are provided to facilitate the fingertip attachment and release actions joining and separating the top and bottom components (see FIG. 18). FIG. 16C is a top plan view of a section of extruded top component 160 showing each of the four (in this example) paired ridges 164a-164d. Those skilled in the art will recognize how the described structure lends itself to manufacture by extrusion techniques. FIGS. 17A-17C represent a section of the extrusion shown in FIGS. 16A-16C cut and modified to be used as a connector component. Top connector component 170 is shown to be structured on a section of substrate 172 with a number of attachment apertures 174 drilled or molded therein. Parallel opposing pair ridge sections 176a-176d are shown in a top plan view in FIG. 17B. FIG. 17C provides a perspective view showing both the arrangement of opposing pair ridge sections 176a-176d on substrate 172, as well as the placement of the plurality of apertures 174 drilled or molded into section of connector 170. Reference is finally made to FIG. 18 for a perspective view of the connector bottom and top components 150 & 170 shown in FIGS. 15C & 17C, showing the manner of attachment between these components. In use, each of the components 150 & 170 would be secured to a strap or belt using the above described holes in each component section. In the view of FIG. 18, the angled end edges of component 170 are shown to facilitate the releasing action whereby the user may grip the angled edge with a fingertip to begin the motion of pulling the top component up and away from the bottom component. Although the present invention has been described in conjunction with a number of preferred embodiments, those skilled in the art will recognize modifications to these embodiments that still fall within the scope of the present invention. Because of the wide variety of applications for the attachment surfaces of the present invention, the dimensions of the straps, bands, or patch surfaces may be structured as small or as large as required. 1.
