Botanical classification: Gaillardia aristata. Variety denomination: ‘Sunny Wheeler’. CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is co-pending with a U.S. Plant Patent Applications filed for plants derived from the Inventor's breeding program that are entitled Gaillardia Plant Named ‘Fancy Wheeler’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 22,016), ‘Lucky Wheeler’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 23,544), and Gaillardia Plant Named ‘Jazzy Wheeler’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 22,217). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Gaillardia plant, botanically known as Gaillardia aristata ‘Sunny Wheeler’ and will be referred to hereinafter by its cultivar name, ‘Sunny Wheeler’. ‘Sunny Wheeler’ was derived from a controlled breeding program conducted by the Inventor at his nursery in Schwamstedt, Germany. The breeding program focuses on obtaining new cultivars of Gaillardia with compact and floriferous plant habit in a range of flower colors. In summer 2009, the Inventor made a cross between unnamed plants from his breeding program as both the female and male parents (sowing no. G10004). Sunny Wheeler' was selected in 2010 by the Inventor as a single unique plant from the resulting seedlings. Asexual propagation of the new cultivar was first accomplished under the direction of the Inventor by in vitro propagation in Rijswijk, The Netherlands in 2010. Asexual propagation by stem cuttings and tissue culture has determined that the characteristics of the new cultivar are stable and are reproduced true to type in successive generations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the characteristics of the new cultivar of Gaillardia. These attributes in combination distinguish ‘Sunny Wheeler’ as unique from all other varieties of Gaillardia known to the Inventor. 1. ‘Sunny Wheeler’ exhibits medium sized inflorescences with ray florets with fluted petals that are bright yellow in color with a slight blush of red at the base.2. ‘Sunny Wheeler’ is reliably perennial and hardy in U.S.D.A. Zones 3 to 9.3. ‘Sunny Wheeler’ exhibits a dwarf, spreading plant habit.4. ‘Sunny Wheeler’ produces numerous blooms throughout the growing season. Both the male and female parents of ‘Sunny Wheeler’ differ from ‘Sunny Wheeler’ in having more red coloration to the petals (less yellow). ‘Sunny Wheeler’ can also be most close compared to cultivars from the same breeding program ‘Fancy Wheeler’, ‘Lucky Wheeler’ and ‘Jazzy Wheeler’. They are all three similar in having a dwarf, spreading plant habit. ‘Fancy Wheeler’ differs from ‘Sunny Wheeler’ in having larger inflorescences with ray florets that have red centers and yellow tips and lack fluted petals. ‘Jazzy Wheeler’ differs from ‘Sunny Wheeler’ in having inflorescences with ray florets that have yellow-orange centers and yellow tips and in lacking fluted petals. ‘Lucky Wheeler’ is similar to ‘Sunny Wheeler’ in having inflorescences with fluted ray florets but differs from ‘Sunny Wheeler’ in having inflorescences with ray florets that have red centers and yellow tips (bicolor). BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The accompanying colored photographs illustrate the overall appearance and distinct characteristics of the new Gaillardia. The photographs were taken of a plant about 14-months in age as grown outdoors in a 10-liter container in Schwamstedt, Germany. The photograph in FIG. 1 provides a close-up view of inflorescences of ‘Sunny Wheeler’ when newly open and the photograph in FIG. 2 provides a view of the plant habit of ‘Sunny Wheeler’. The colors in the photographs are as close as possible with the digital photography and printing techniques utilized and the color codes in the detailed botanical description accurately describe the colors of the new Gaillardia. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION The detailed botanical data was collected from plants about 14-months in age as grown in 10-liter containers in an unheated greenhouse in Schwamstedt, Germany. The phenotype of the new cultivar may vary with variations in environmental, climatic, and cultural conditions, as it has not been tested under all possible environmental conditions. The color determination is in accordance with The 2007 R.H.S. Colour Chart of The Royal Horticultural Society, London, England, except where general color terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used.
