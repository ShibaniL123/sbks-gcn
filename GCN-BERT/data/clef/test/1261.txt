1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-{N-[(R)-α-((S)-2-carboxypyrrolidin-1-ylcarbonyl)benzyl]carbamoylmethoxy}-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazenine
1,1-Dioxo-3,3-dibutyl-5-phenyl-7-methylthio-8-(N-{(R)-α-[(S)-2-(t-butoxycarbonyl) pyrrolidin-1-ylcarbonyl]benzyl}carbamoylmethoxy)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,5-benzothiadiazepine (Method 10; 41 mg, 0.052 mmol) was dissolved in DCM : TFA 4:1 (3 ml) and stirred for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by preparative HPLC using an acetonitrile/ammonium acetate buffer gradient (5/95 to 100/0) as eluent. 26.5 mg (70%) of the title compound was obtained after lyophilisation. M/z 737.3034.
