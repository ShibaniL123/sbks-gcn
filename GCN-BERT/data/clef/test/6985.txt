Similarly to example 13.4, starting from 410 mg (1 mmol) of [3-(2-benzyloxy-ethyl)-5-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid and 296 mg (1.2 mmol) of 3-piperidin-4-yl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-2-one (prepared as described in example 16.4), 320 mg (50%) of 3-(2-benzyloxy-ethyl)-5-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione is obtained in the form of a pale pink solid.
