DRILLING FLUID AND PROCESS OF MAKING THE SAME [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/990,371, filed May 8, 2014, which is incorporated in its entirety herein by reference. [0002] A drilling fluid is provided that includes a linear olefin portion and an oligomer portion. More specifically, the drilling fluid has a low pour point, good biodegradation and low toxicity. BACKGROUND [0003] Drilling fluids lubricate drilling components and carry cuttings to a surface of a borehole. Conventional drilling fluids include diesel and kerosene hydrocarbons which have poor biodegradability and/or toxicity when used in environmentally sensitive areas, such as marine environments. Synthetic drilling fluids seek to improve biodegradability, toxicity, and pour point properties. Recent changes in environmental legislation allows for the discharge of certain classes of synthetic drilling fluids which meet specific criteria for environmental safety. This increased need for drilling fluids which meet stringent biodegradability and toxicity requirements has created a shortage of environmentally acceptable fluids. Even with the above improvements in the technology, there remains a need and a desire for drilling fluids with a low pour point and less polluting characteristics, such as good biodegradation and low toxicity. SUMMARY [0004] A drilling fluid includes a linear olefin portion that includes linear alpha olefins and/or linear internal olefins with carbon numbers of about 6 carbons to about 30 carbons. The oligomer portion includes dimers, trimers, tetramers, and/or heavier oligomers of olefins. In this aspect, the olefins have a carbon number of between about 4 carbons and about 24 carbons, and the oligomer portion includes at least about 50 mole percent of trisubstituted olefin. The drilling fluid has a pour point of about -10 °C or lower, a biodegradation ratio of about 1.0 or less, a toxicity ratio of about 1.0 or less, a Marine Bodis of at least about 60%, a flash point of about 110 °C or higher, an olefin content of 90 weight % or higher, a viscosity less than about 4 cSt at 40 °C, a density of about 0.78 to about 0.83 gram/ml, and a log Pow of greater than about 3. [0005] A process for producing a drilling fluid includes oliogmerizing olefins having a carbon number between about 4 carbons and about 24 carbons to form an oligomer portion, wherein the oligomer portion is formed with acid type catalyst. The process further includes blending the oligomer portion with a linear olefin portion to form the drilling fluid.

[0065] According to one aspect, the fluid can have a toxicity ratio of less than or equal to about 1.0. as measured by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method El 367-99 testing protocol as required in the United States Environmental Protection Agency NPDES 2012 (National Pollution Discharge Elimination System) General Permit for New and Existing Sources and New Discharges in the Offshore Subcategory of the Oil and Gas Extraction Category for the Western Portion of the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico (GMG290000 and TXG330000) which uses Leptocheirus Plumulosus in a 10-day sediment toxicity test. The toxicity test compares the fluid to a reference standard of internal olefin molecules having 65 mole percent of molecules with a carbon number of 16 carbons and 35 mole percent of molecules with a carbon number of 18 carbons. [0066] The toxicity ratio can be defined by the equation below and based on weight percent, where a value of 1.054 or less forms an acceptable result and LC50 represents a concentration in milligrams per liter needed to kill half a sample population of a test subject. Toxicity Ratio = 10-day LCsn of reference standard 10-day LC50 [0067] Desirably, the fluid has a toxicity ratio of less than or equal to about 1.0, in another aspect, less than or equal to about 0.95, in another aspect, less than or equal to about 0.9, and in another aspect, less than or equal to about 0.85, and/or the like. The entire teachings and contents of American Society for Testing and Materials method E1367-99 testing protocol are hereby incorporated by reference into this specification in their entirety. [0068] According to one aspect, the drilling fluid can have an improved toxicity of at least about 5 percent over both a toxicity of the linear olefin portion alone and the oligomer portion alone, in another aspect, at least about 10 percent over both a toxicity of the linear olefin portion alone and the oligomer portion alone, in another aspect, at least about 15 percent over both a toxicity of the linear olefin portion alone and the oligomer portion alone, in another aspect, at least about 20 percent over both a toxicity of the linear olefin portion alone and the oligomer portion alone, in another aspect, at least about 25 percent over both a toxicity of the linear olefin portion alone and the oligomer portion alone, and in another aspect, at least about 30 percent over both a toxicity of the linear olefin portion alone and the oligomer portion alone.

[0070] According to one embodiment, the fluid will meet the minimum criteria for use as specified by the National Council for the Environment (CONAMA) Resolution 23/94 as administered by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), which includes the biodegradation and toxicity testing protocol as defined in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Final NPDES 2012 General Permit for New and Existing Sources and New Discharges in the Offshore Subcategory of the Oil and Gas Extraction Category for the Western Portion of the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico (GMG290000 and TXG330000) as outlined herein. [0071] Without being bound by theory of operation, generally larger molecules, such as carbon numbers above CI 8, have a lower (poorer) biodegradability factor, since it is a larger molecule and takes a longer time for microbes to digest the larger molecule. Generally larger molecules have a higher (better) toxicity factor, since smaller molecules break down into compounds that are toxic when consumed into microbes. Since larger molecules break down into remaining large compounds, the larger molecules may not be readily consumed into the microbes and result in a better toxicity factor. [0072] Surprisingly and unexpectedly, the linear olefin portion has an improved biodegradation and a good toxicity when blended with the oliogomer portion. Without being bound by theory, the trisubstituted and/or branched molecules may provide multiple points for microbes to attack and/or digest the molecule to allow for better biodegradation while remaining large enough to have lower toxicity. [0073] Surprisingly and unexpectedly, the linear olefin portion with higher carbon numbers, such as at least about 20 weight percent C24, has a good biodegradation. Also surprisingly and unexpectedly, the oligomer portions with lower carbon numbers, such as at least 50 weight percent C14 has satisfactory toxicity ratios. [0074] Desirably, the drilling fluid and/or fluid components of the drilling fluid do not include and/or contain polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and/or polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, such as liquids made by synthetic processes and/or steps. The linear olefin portion can include any minimal amount and/or content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and/or polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, such as less than about 0.00001 grams of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons per gram of a base fluid (passing test level), about 0 grams of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons per gram of a base fluid as measured by Method 1654A, as published in Methods for the Determination of Diesel, Mineral and Cruse Oils in Offshore Oil and Gas Industry Discharges. [0075] Similarly, the drilling fluid including both the linear olefin portion and the oligomer portion may include any minimal amount or content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, such as less than about 0.00001 grams of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons per gram of a base fluid, about 0 grams of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons per gram of a base fluid. [0076] In another aspect, the drilling fluid has a minimum 96-hour LC50 of 30,000 ppm in a seawater to drilling fluid suspended particulate phase (SPP) volumetric ratio using Mysidopsis bahia or Mysis relicta as identified in Appendix 2 to Subpart A of Part 435 - Drilling Fluids Toxicity Test (EPA Method 1619) in 40 CFR Part 435. [0077] According to one embodiment, the linear olefin portion is not isomerized and/or hydrogenated (saturated). In the alternative, the linear olefin portion may be isomerized and/or hydrogenated. EXAMPLES [0078] The following examples illustrate the preparation and testing of base fluids with a toxicity enhancement component. Biodegradation and toxicity ratios were measured against a reference sample and according to the NPDES testing protocol described herein. Carbon number distribution was analyzed using gas chromatography techniques. Olefin distribution was analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. FIRST EXAMPLE SET [0079] The material of Example 1A was prepared by oligomerizing 1-octene using a boron trifluoride catalyst with 2-methoxyethanol as a promoter, according to Theriot, U.S. Patent 5,068,487. The entire contents and teachings of Theriot, U.S. Patent 5,068,487 are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The resultant material was then distilled to have the unreacted monomer removed and the balance of the material was collected to form the material of Example 1 A. The material of Example 4 was prepared by blending 50 weight percent of the material of Example 1 A and 50 weight percent of the material of Example 2A to form Example 4. Example 2A (C14LAO) is a commercially available linear alpha olefin, from Ineos Oligomers, based in League City, Texas, U.S.A.

[0080] Figure 1 shows a bar graph of both the Toxicity and Biodegradation ratios for each of the following; Example 1A, Example 2A and Example 4, where less than 1.054 is considered an acceptable or "passing" value. Surprisingly and unexpectedly, Example 4 has a toxicity ratio which is better than that of both Examples 1 A and Example 2A. The biodegradation ratio of Example 4 also shows a marked improvement over the predicted biodegradation ratio result. [0081] Figure 2 shows the toxicity Dose response curves of Example 4 and the applicable reference standard as used to calculate the toxicity ratio according to the NPDES testing protocol described above. The dose response curve of Example 4 exhibits a response which is better suited for a probit analysis as per the EPA standard of Eco toxicological calculations. SECOND EXAMPLE SET [0082] The material of Example 5 was prepared by blending a ratio of 20 weight percent of the material of Example 1 A and 20 weight percent of the material of Example 2A with 60 weight percent of the material of Example 3 to form Example 5. Example 2A (C14LAOJ and Example 3 (C1618IO) are available from Ineos Oligomers based in League City, Texas, U.S.A. Table 2 shows the analysis of the materials of used in the formation of Example 5.

Surprisingly and unexpectedly, Example 5 has a toxicity ratio which is better than that of the material of Example 1A and Example 2A, and similar values to that of Example 3. The biodegradation ratio of Example 5 also shows a marked improvement over the predicted biodegradation ratio result. THIRD EXAMPLE SET [0084] The material of Example IB was prepared by oligomerizing 1-octene using a boron trifluoride catalyst with 2-methoxyethanol as a promoter, according to Theriot, U.S. Patent 5,068,487. The entire contents and teachings of Theriot, U.S. Patent 5,068,487 are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The resultant material was then distilled to have the unreacted monomer removed and the balance of the material was collected to form the material of Example IB. The material of Example 6 was prepared by blending a ratio of 50 weight percent of the material of Example IB and 50 weight percent of the material of Example 2B to form Example 6. Example 2B (C14LAO) is available from Ineos Oligomers based in League City, Texas, U.S.A. Table 3 shows the analysis of the materials of Example IB, Example 2B and Example 6.

Additionally Example 6 has an improved biodegradation ratio over that of the predicted ratio. FOURTH EXAMPLE SET [0086] The materials in Example 7, Example 8, and Example 9 were prepared by oligomerizing 1-hexene using boron trifluoride catalyst and a promoter system comprising at least one protic compound(s) or some combination of protic and aprotic promoters according to the following patents which illustrate but a few of the many methods describes for making oligomers: see for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,682,823; 3,763,244; 3,769,363; 3,780,123; 3,798,284; 3,884,988; 3,097,924; 3,997,621; 4,045,507; and 4,045,508. 1-Butanol or 1-Propanol are specific examples of protic promoter compounds and butyl acetate is an example of an aprotic promoter used in combination with the alcohol promoter such U.S. Pat. 3,997,621. Table 4 shows the analysis of 3 materials made from these processes after residual unreacted monomer was removed by distillation. Example 9 was used to prepare both Example 12 and Example 13.

Surprisingly all three examples showed a sediment toxicity which was not expected. Specifically Example 7 where the sediment toxicity ratio was substantially lower than expected based on industry perception that trisubstituted molecules are more toxic. Additionally, there existed a clear trend in the data which was also unexpected. [0088] The material of Example 12 was prepared by blending a ratio of 20 weight percent of Example 9 with 80 weight percent of Example 11 (C1618IO) which is available from Ineos Oligomers based in League City, Texas, U.S.A.
