Example 9. Preparation of N-(3-(4-(4-(cyclohexylmethyl)piperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)-N-phenylpentanamide (LMT-831)
A final product, N-(3-(4-(4-(cyclohexylmethyl)piperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)-N-phenylpentaneamide, was obtained (35 mg, 56% yield) by the same method as described in Example 7 using the N-phenyl-N-(3-(4-(piperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)pentaneamide (50 mg, 0.124 mmol) obtained in Example 2 and bromomethylcyclohexane (20 Âµl, 0.145 mmol).
