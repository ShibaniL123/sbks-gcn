Botanical designation: Rosa hybrid. Variety denomination: ‘Poulpah067’. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention constitutes a new and distinct variety of miniature rose plant which originated from a controlled crossing between the female seed parent, an unnamed seedling, and the male pollen parent, also an unnamed seedling. The two parents were crossed during the summer of 2007 and the resulting seeds were planted in a controlled environment in Fredensborg, Denmark. The new variety, named ‘Poulpah067’, originated as a single seedling from the stated cross. The new variety may be distinguished from its male pollen parent and female seed parent primarily by flower coloration and growth habit. The female seed parent is 20 cm in height while the claimed plant is 35 cm in height. The male pollen parent has a general tonality of flower color which is Orange 27 A while the claimed plant is Yellow-Orange Group 16A. The objective of the hybridization of this rose variety for commercial culture was to create a new and distinct variety with unique qualities, such as: 1. Uniform and abundant yellow-orange blend flowers;2. Vigorous and compact growth;3. Year-round flowering under glasshouse conditions;4. Suitability for production from softwood cuttings in pots;5. Durable flowers and foliage which make a variety suitable for distribution in the floral industry. This combination of qualities is not present in previously available commercial cultivars of this type, known to the inventor, and distinguish ‘Poulpah067’ from all other varieties of which we are aware. As part of the rose development program, Mogens N. Olesen germinated the seeds from the aforementioned hybridization and conducted evaluations on the resulting seedlings in a controlled environment in Fredensborg, Denmark. ‘Poulpah067’ was selected by the inventor as a single plant from the progeny of the hybridization in 2007. Asexual reproduction of ‘Poulpah067’ by cuttings was first done by Mogens N. Olesen in the nursery in Fredensborg, Denmark in 2008. This initial and other subsequent propagations conducted in controlled environments have demonstrated that the characteristics of ‘Poulpah067’ are true to type and are transmitted from one generation to the next. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The accompanying color illustrations show as true as is reasonably possible to obtain in color photographs of this type, the typical characteristics of the buds, flowers, leaves, and stems, of ‘Poulpah067’. Specifically illustrated in FIG. 1 are flowers at various stages of development, flower petals, and flowers in parts. Illustrated in FIG. 2 are leaves, and stems. Illustrated plants are 5 months of age. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE VARIETY The following is a description of ‘Poulpah067’, as observed in its growth in glasshouses in Fredensborg, Denmark. Observed plants are 5 months of age and were cultivated in 20 cm pots. Color references are made using The Royal Horticultural Society (London, England) Colour Chart, 2001, except where common terms of color are used. For a comparison, several physical characteristics of the rose variety ‘Poulymp’, U.S. Plant Pat. No. 16,744 are compared to ‘Poulpah067’ in Chart 1.
