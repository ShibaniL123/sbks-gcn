1-(1-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-6-(3'-ethyl-[1,4'-bipiperidin]-1'-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine hydrochloride
The title compounds were prepared from (Z)-3,5-dichloro-2-((2-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)hydrazono)methyl)pyrazine and (E)-3,5-dichloro-2-((2-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)hydrazono)methyl)pyrazine (Example 8, Step 1, 100 mg, 0.275 mmol) by procedures similar to those described in Example 8, Step 2, replacing 3'-methyl-1,4'-bipiperidine 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate with 3'-ethyl-1,4'-bipiperidine (Example 6, Step 3, 107.9 mg, 0.549 mmol). The crude was purified by reverse phase preparative HPLC (Gemini-NX, 10 μm, 250×30 mm, C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, Calif.), eluent: 0 to 100% acetonitrile in water, both eluents containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, gradient elution over 30 min). The fractions containing the desired product were concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was free-based by passing it through a Agilent PL-HCO3 ion exchange column using dichloromethane and methanol (4:1) as eluent and concentrated under reduced pressure. HCl (1N in diethyl ether, 1 mL) was added and then the mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to give the title compound (42 mg, 31% yield, 3:2 dr).
