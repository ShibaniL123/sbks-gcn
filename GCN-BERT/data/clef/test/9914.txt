Chair Field of the Invention The present invention concerns a chair. More particularly, but not exclusively, the invention concerns a seat for a chair and a backrest for a chair. Background of the Invention Chairs are typically formed from a seat resting on legs and a backrest extending upwards from the back of the seat. A person sits on the seat and leans back against the backrest. Numerous designs of seats and backrests are available. Typical considerations when designing a chair, seat or backrest are comfort and appearance. In some cases it is necessary to trade off one of those things against the other. For example, in order to create a chair with a suitably formal appearance, it may be necessary to sacrifice some of the comfort that may be obtained with a more laid back chair. The present invention seeks to mitigate the abovementioned problems. Alternatively or additionally, the present invention seeks to provide improved seats, backrests and chairs. Summary of the Invention The present invention provides, according to a first aspect, a seat for a chair, the seat comprising a first body of foam having a first density and a second body of foam having a second, higher density wherein across a region of the seat the thickness of the first body relative to the second body increases in a direction toward the rear of the seat such that, when a person sits on the seat, the rear of the region compresses more than the front of the region. Because the seat comprises two bodies of foam, with the second body having a higher density, and the thickness of the two bodies varies the seat does not compress uniformly when a person sits on it. Instead areas of the seat where the second body are thicker compress less than other areas. The result is that the shape of the seat is different under compression than when the seat is unloaded. As a result it may be possible to avoid the necessity of trades off between appearance and comfort as the seat can be designed to appear one way when unloaded, but to take a second, more comfortable shape when sat upon. Because the thickness of the first body relative to the second body increases in a direction toward the rear of the seat, the seat adapts into a 'bucket' shape when sat upon, with a raised section toward the front of the seat that provides support under the backs of the knees. Preferably the combined thickness of the first and second body of foam is constant across the region of the seat. In that way the region appears flat, but adapts into a 'bucket' shape when sat upon. Preferably the first body is on top of the second body. Since the first body is the less-dense foam, the seat may provide a more comfortable surface if the first body is on top . It may be that the region spans the entire seat, however preferably the first body overlaps the second body on all sides. If the first body sits on top of, and overlaps the second body, then the second body is completely smothered by the first body. As a result there is no join between the first and second body on any of the top or side faces of the seat. Since those are the faces with which contact may be made by a person sitting on the seat, the absence of a join on any of those surfaces may result in a particularly comfortable seat. Preferably the front edge of the second body is between 20 and 50 mm back from the front edge of the seat. That may provide appropriate support behind the knees. Preferably the back edge of the second body is between 120 and 150 mm forward from the back of the seat. Preferably the distance from the front edge of the seat to the back edge of the second body is no more than two thirds of the distance from the front of the seat to the back of the seat. Such positions of the back edge of the second body may provide a suitably-sized area on which to sit. Preferably the maximum thickness of the second body is no more than 80 ℅ of the combined thickness of the first and second bodies. In that way there may always be a sufficient thickness of the lower density foam to ensure a comfortable seat surface that conforms to the user. It may be that the second body is a wedge. A wedge may provide the necessary support behind the knees and deeper seating area whilst being straightforward to manufacture. A wedge may also avoid waste in the manufacturing process since two wedges may be cut from a cuboid of foam with no waste. Preferably the top surface of the first body is flat across the entire seat. It will be understood that the top surface is flat when the seat is unloaded. A flat seat may be a requirement for the chair and the invention permits a seat that appears flat when unloaded, but then compresses into a more comfortable shape with behind knee support when a person sits on the seat. According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a chair comprising a seat according to the first aspect of the invention. The seat may be particularly advantageous when used in a chair since a person will then be likely to sit squarely on the seat and derive maximum benefit from the invention. According to a third aspect of the invention, there is provided a backrest for a chair, the backrest comprising a frame having a cross-member with a concave front surface and a segment of foam attached to the frame, wherein the back surface of the segment fits against the concave front surface of the curved cross-member and the front surface of the segment is flat, such that, when a person leans against the back rest, the segment compresses resulting in a concave front surface of the segment. Thus, and similarly to the seat, the backrest can be manufactured so as to appear one shape but then to provide a comfortable curved shape when leant against. Preferably the segment fills the entire cavity of the concave front surface, in which case the concave front surface may be completely concealed when unloaded. Preferably the front surface of the backrest is flat. In that way the backrest may appear flat, but then provide a curved back when leant against. Preferably the backrest has a fabric covering. A fabric covering is flexible and the shape of the backrest is therefore determined by the shape of the foam segment. Preferably the cross-member runs across the top of the backrest. The top of the backrest may be the location under greatest load when a person leans against the backrest and therefore the location at which a comfortable shape is most important. However, it may be that the cross-member extends across the height of the backrest. Thus the entire backrest would appear one shape but then adapt to a more comfortable shape when leant against. It may be that there are a plurality of cross-member each having a concave front surface and a plurality of corresponding segments of foam, each segment having a back surface that fits against the concave front surface of the corresponding curved cross-member and a flat front surface, such that, when a person leans against the back rest, the segments compress resulting in concave front surfaces of the segments. Multiple crossmembers may lead to a lighter, but strong construction and by providing segments on each cross-member the backrest can maintain the advantages of the invention. According to a fourth aspect of the invention, there is provided a chair comprising a backrest according to the third aspect of the invention. According to a fifth aspect of the invention, there is provided a chair comprising a seat according to the first aspect of the invention and a backrest according to the third aspect of the invention It will of course be appreciated that features described in relation to one aspect of the present invention may be incorporated into other aspects of the present invention. For example, the chairs of the invention may incorporate any of the features described with reference to the seat or backrest of the invention and vice versa. Description of the Drawings Embodiments of the present invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying schematic drawings of which: Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4 Figure 5 Figure 6 shows a perspective view of a seat for a chair according to a first embodiment of the invention; shows a transparent view of Figure 1; shows an underside perspective view of the seat of Figure 1; shows an underside cut-away view of the seat of Figure 1; is a top cut-away view of a backrest according to a second embodiment of the invention; and is a perspective view of a chair according to a third embodiment of the invention. Detailed Description In Figure 1 a seat 1 for a chair comprises a first body 3 made from foam. In Figures 2, 3 and 4, the first body 3 sits on top of, and overlapping, a second body 5, in this case a wedge, of higher density foam. Across the region of the seat in which both bodies are present, the thickness of the first body 3 relative to the second body 5 increases in a direction toward the back of the seat 1. In use, a person sits on the seat 1 and compresses the foam bodies 3 and 5. The seat 1, which has a flat top when unloaded, therefore compresses more at the back than it does toward the front where the second body 5 is thickest. This creates a 'bucket' effect and provides support behind the knees. The apparently flat seat 1 therefore takes on a more comfortable shape when someone sits on it. In Figure 5 a backrest 2 comprises a cross-member 4 with a concave front surface. Within the cavity formed by the concave front surface there is a segment 6 of foam, which fills the cavity. The backrest 2 is covered with a fabric 8. When a person leans against the backrest 2 the segment 6 compresses and the backrest 2, which appeared flat when unloaded, takes on a more comfortable shape. In Figure 6 a chair 10 has a seat 11 as described in relation to Figures 1 to 4 and a backrest 12 as described in relation to Figure 5. The seat 11 and backrest 12 are covered in fabric and the chair 10 appears to have flat surfaces. However, when a person sits on the seat 11 of the chair 10 and leans back against the backrest 12 they deform as described above to a more comfortable shape.
