Step 3: Benzyl 4-((2-(4-(benzyloxy)phenyl)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetoxy)methyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate
A stirred solution of benzyl 4-((2-oxo-2-phenylacetoxy)methyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate 10.59 g, 27.8 mmol) in THF (120 mL) cooled to −78° C. was added with a solution of (4-(benzyloxy)phenyl)magnesium bromide (0.8 M in THF, 38 mL, 30.6 mmol). The reaction mixture was slowly allowed to warm to 10° C. over 18 hours. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with aqueous 1M hydrochloric acid and brine. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (eluent-100% iso-hexane to 1:4 ethyl acetate/iso-hexane) to afford the title compound g, 55%).
