TITLE: ANTIMICROBIAL ARTICLES PRODUCED BY ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING TECHNICAL FIELD Various embodiments disclosed herein generally relate to implantable medical devices. More specifically, this disclosure pertains to implantable medical devices provided with antimicrobial properties throughout their structures and on their surfaces. BACKGROUND Numerous types of medical devices have been developed for implantation into patients' bodies. For example, it has become common practice for dentists to provide their patients with custom dental prosthesis and/or implants to replace non-functional or missing teeth. The replacement prosthesis and/or implants can be individually designed and manufactured for precise installation into specific pre-identified sites. It has become routine for patients with abnormal or irregular rates of heart contractions, to have pacemaker devices installed under their skin in the chest area or alternatively, in their abdomens. Patients with debilitating degenerative diseases affecting their joints and/or skeletal elements are now able to have a large measure of their quality of life restored by replacement of the afflicted structures with man-made artificial implants such as replacement hip components, knee joint components, shoulder components, and the like. Patients who've suffered extreme trauma resulting in severely fractured bones are often provided with fracture fixation plates, fixtures, pins, nails, intramedullary rods, and the like to hold fractured bone segments together during the healing process and/or to replace destroyed or missing skeletal segments. However, all of these types of implantable devices expose the patients to risk of post-installation infection along and/or about the outer surfaces of the devices serving as colonization sites. Particularly problematic is the establishment of infectious biofilms on the surfaces of implanted devices. More severe cases of infection often result in microbial penetration into the inner structural components of the implants requiring their removal and replacement. Numerous strategies have been employed in attempts to prevent post-installation infections occurring on and about the surfaces the implanted medical devices. For example, flexible resilient silicone-based coatings with antimicrobial and/or anti-fungal additives have been developed for encasing the outer surfaces of medical implants at the time of implant manufacture. Such coatings are typically produced by first, dissolving a suitable silicone exemplified by methyltri-methoxy silanes, methyl tri-acetoxy silanes, tetratchlorosilanes, vinyl trimetho-ryl silanes, gamma-ureidopropyltrimethoxy silanes, and the like, in a suitable solvent exemplified by toluenes, hexanes, xylenes, tetrahydrofurans, cyclohexanones, and the like. Second, dissolving an antimicrobial compound and/or an anti-fungal compound in a suitable solvent exemplified by n-methylpyrrolidinone, alkylesters of C1-12 carboxylic acids, and the like. Third, mixing together the silane solution and the antimicrobial and/or antifungal solution. Four, immersing medical implants into the mixed solutions followed by removal and air-drying of the encased implants, then baking at about 90° C for up to one hour to set the coating and to completely evaporate the solvents. Such antibiotic-encased implants are purported to release the antimicrobial and/or anti-fungal compounds upon contact of the medical implant with tissues after implantation. Another common approach has been to incorporate antimicrobial compounds and/or drugs into implants comprising polymeric materials, during their manufacture so that the antimicrobial compounds are eluted from the implants into the surrounding. These types of implants are generally referred to as drug-eluting implants. Some such implants are manufactured by dissolving the antimicrobial compounds into one or more solvents used for solubilising selected polymeric materials. The solubilised polymeric materials and antimicrobial compounds are mixed together and then poured or dispensed into forms wherein they solidify, and then are finished into the final implant. Other strategies involve first preparing an implant, then producing one or more recesses and/or crevices in selected locations on the outer surface, and then filling with recesses and/or crevices with a drug delivery matrix that this allowed to at least semi-harden. The drugs are then eluted from the matrix over a period of time. In some implant combinations, for example a "ball" and "socket" combination for a complete hip replacement or a total knee replacement package comprising a femoral component, a tibial tray, a tibial insert, and a patellar component, the drug delivery matrix may be incorporated into weight-bearing surfaces of one or more components so that the drugs are released by frictional forces created when two or more implant components rub against each other during their normal articulating functions. Other implant drug-eluting strategies have reservoirs cast into the implants' interior structure. The reservoirs are filled with drug solutions prior to installation of an implant into a patient. Some implants are configured to communicate and cooperate with external reservoirs containing drug solutions that are externally pumped into and/or about the implants on prophylactic schedules or alternatively, when an infection is detected. It is general practise to use antibiotic-loaded cements exemplified by PROSTALAC® (PROSTALAC is a registered trademark of Depuy Orthopaedic Inc., Warsaw, IN, USA) and SIMPLEX® (SIMPLEX is a registered trademark of Howmedica Osteonics Corp., Mahwah, NJ, USA) for installation of orthopaedic implants. While these cements have considerable value for minimizing the occurrence of post-operative infections immediately after installation of orthopaedic implants, their long-term benefits are limited because the antibiotics tend to rapidly dissipate from the surfaces of the cements upon exposure to mammalian tissues. There still remain numerous infection-susceptibility related problems with the implants commonly available and in general use. There are concerns that the efficacies of some antimicrobial compounds and/or drugs are altered or compromised by the solvents which are used for their dissolution and/or by solvents used for dissolution of polymeric materials used for casting implants. Furthermore, it is known that the efficacies of drug- eluting implants increasingly diminish over time and are limited by drug "loading" limitations by the implant manufacturing processes. Implants provided with drug-loaded recesses / crevices may provide protection from infections about the crevice sites for a period of time, but are quite susceptible to microbial colonization and biofilm formation on their surface areas at locations removed from the recesses / crevices. Compounding these problems, are the surgical challenges of removing the infected implants, abrading surrounding infected skeletal structures, excising surrounding infected tissues, and installing replacement implants. SUMMARY The present disclosure pertains to implantable antimicrobial medical devices having antimicrobial compounds evenly sequestered throughout their structural matrices and distributed across their surfaces. The antimicrobial compounds may be eluted from the surfaces and from within the structural matrices after implantation of the medical devices into a mammalian subject. The present disclosure also pertains to methods for producing implantable medical devices comprising elutable antimicrobial compounds sequestered within their structural matrices and distributed across their surfaces. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present disclosure pertains to methods for producing implantable antibiotic- eluting polymeric medical devices having antimicrobial compounds and/or bactericidal compounds homogenously distributed and sequestered throughout their structural matrix and across their surfaces. The present disclosure also pertains to implantable antibiotic- sequestering and eluting medical devices produced by the exemplary methods disclosed herein. The exemplary methods of the present disclosure are particularly useful for producing substantially rigid articles that are suitable for surgical implantation into mammalian bodies, for example humans, primates, livestock, ruminants, equines, canines, felines, and the like. The exemplary methods are also useful for producing external hard-shell casings for implantable devices such as cardiac pacemakers, spinal cord stimulators, neurostimulation systems, intrathecal drug pumps for delivery of medicants into the spinal fluid, infusion pumps for delivery of chemotherapeutics and/or anti-spasmodics, insulin pumps, osmotic pumps, heparin pumps, and the like. The exemplary methods are also useful for producing dental prosthesis, dental implants comprising one or more replacement tooth components, and the like. The exemplary methods are also useful for producing transcutaneous skin surface treatment devices exemplified by devices for providing transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and by devices for providing long-term percutaneous access. The exemplary methods are also useful for producing wound treatment surface devices exemplified by staples and sutures, and the like. The exemplary methods are particularly useful for producing three-dimensional intricate orthopaedic skeletal components including but not limited to articulating joint replacements, hip joint spacers, knee joint spacers, shoulder joint spacers, and the like. The three-dimensional intricate orthopaedic skeletal components may be temporary structures or alternatively, permanent structures. The exemplary methods generally incorporate into manufacturing processes using additive manufacturing technologies, the concurrent deposition of one or more antimicrobial and/or biocidal compositions with the base feedstock materials to form the three-dimensional physical structures comprising the implantable antimicrobial articles of the present disclosure. The articles may be formed into solid and dense non-porous three-dimensional structures. Alternatively, the structures may be formed into heterogenous three-dimensional structures comprising solid regions and porous regions. Alternatively, the structures may comprise inner cores having heterogenous three-dimensional structures that are overlaid with outer coverings comprising one or more solid dense layers. One or more selected antimicrobial compositions may be incorporated into the inner cores and/or into the outer coverings. Alternatively, the structures may comprise inner cores comprising a first heterogenous three dimensional structure with a first degree of porosity, overlaid with one or more layers of a second heterogenous three dimensional structure with a second degree of porosity.

It is expected that tobramycin and/or gentamicin and/or neomycin and/or vancomycin are particularly suitable for concurrent deposition with polymeric materials for additive manufacturing of the antimicrobial medical devices of the present disclosure. Various thermoplastic polymers and/or free radical polymers and/or cross-linked polymers may be used for concurrent deposition with antibiotic compositions to produce the antimicrobial articles disclosed herein. For example poly (methyl methacrylates), acrylonitrile butadiene styrenes, polycarbonates, blends of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene(s) and polycarbonate(s), polyether ether ketones, polyethylenes, polyamides, polylactic acids, polyphenylsulfones, polystyrenes, nylon particularly nylon 12, among others. Also useful are methylmethacrylates, polylactides, polyglycolides, polycaprolactones, polyanhydrides, polyamines, polyurethanes, polyesteramides, polyorthoesters, polydioxanones, polyacetals, polyketals, polycarbonates, polyorthocarbonates, polyphosphazenes, succinates, poly(malic acid), poly(amino acids), polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, polyhydroxycellulose, polysaccharides, chitin, chitosan, and copolymers, block copolymers, multi-block copolymers, multi-block co-polymers with polyethylene glycol (PEG), polyols, terpolymers and mixtures thereof.

Granular materials binding processes exemplified by selective laser sintering, selective laser liquefying, selective heat sintering and electron beam liquefying (all referred to herein as "SLS"), comprise selective fusing of print media in a granular bed. In this type of method, a high power laser is used to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass that has a desired three-dimensional shape. The laser selectively fuses powdered material by scanning cross-sections generated from a 3-D digital description of the part (for example from a CAD file or scan data) on the surface of a powder bed. After each cross-section is scanned, the powder bed is lowered by one layer thickness, a new layer of material is applied on top, and the process is repeated until the part is completed. Because finished part density depends on peak laser power rather than laser duration, a SLS machine typically uses a pulsed laser. A suitable SLS machine preheats the bulk powder material in the powder bed somewhat below its melting point, to make it easier for the laser to raise the temperature of the selected regions the rest of the way to the melting point. Accordingly, the exemplary implantable polymeric antimicrobial devices disclosed herein may also be produced by SLS 3D printing machines by providing powdered blends of one or more selected granular polymers with one or more selected antibiotic compositions and/or one or more bone-growth-promoting composition.

A SINTERSTATION® HiQ SLS® system (SINTERSTATION and SLS are registered trademarks of 3D Systems Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) was used to print round discs having about diameter of about 1 inch (2.54 cm) and a thickness of about 0.125 inch (0.3175 cm) from each batch of polymer/antibiotic blends. Control discs were printed from pure PLA granules and PCL granules.

S. aureus cultures were grown on TSA amended with 5% sheep blood. A sufficient amount of S. aureus culture was transferred from the TSA culture plates to a 0.85% sterile saline solution to provide a uniform suspension that fell within a 0.5-2.0 McFarland turbidity standard. Aliquots of the S. aureus culture were plated onto Meuller Hinton agar in Petri dishes after which, two test coupons/dish (or alternatively, control coupons) were placed on the agar; one with its shiny side up and the other with its matte side up. The Meuller Hinton agar-containing Petri dishes were then incubated for about 72 hrs at temperatures in the range of about 35° C to about 37° C. The zones of inhibition around each coupon were then measured and recorded (in mm). A clear zone around a test coupon indicates the inhibition of growth of S. aureus. The diameter of the PLA/ Antibiotic blend coupons were 25mm and 26mm for the PCL/ Antibiotic coupons. The diameters of the PLA control coupon were 25 mm and 26 mm respectively, and considered as the "0" points. If no inhibition occurred, then the value "25" was recorded and indicates that no inhibition of microbial growth occurred. The data shown in Table 5 confirm that the antibiotics were eluted from articles printed from each polymer/antibiotic blend.
