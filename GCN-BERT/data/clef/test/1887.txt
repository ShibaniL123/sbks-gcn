Step 2
Dimethyl 2,2'-difluorobiphenyl-3,3'-dicarboxylate (18)
To a stirred solution of methyl 3-bromo-2-fluorobenzoate (4.5 g, 19.31 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (40 mL) at room temperature were added methyl 2-fluoro-3-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzoate (8 g, 28.96 mmol), K2CO3 (5 g, 38.6 mmol) and H2O (3 mL) and degassed with argon for 5 min, prior to the addition of Pd(PPh3)4(1.3 g, 1.15 mmol). The resulting mixture was heated at 100° C. for 16 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with water (100 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3×50 mL); the organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude compound was purified on a silica gel column, eluting with ethyl acetate in pet ether (5:95) to get dimethyl 2,2'-difluorobiphenyl-3,3'-dicarboxylate (3.2 g, yield: 54%, LC/MS: 98%) as an off-white solid.
