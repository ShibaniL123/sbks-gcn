CROSS-REFERENCE TO PRIOR APPLICATION This application is a ยง371 National Stage application of PCT International Application No. PCT/SE2012/051461 filed Dec. 20, 2012, which is incorporated herein in its entirety. TECHNICAL AREA The disclosure relates to an absorbent product with a plane extension including a longitudinal direction, a transverse direction and a thickness direction, wherein the product includes an absorption body, which absorption body includes, in its thickness direction, a liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer and a liquid-absorbent fibrous layer, wherein the open-cell liquid-receiving foam layer and the liquid-absorbent fibrous layer include two opposite, longitudinal side edges extending in the longitudinal direction and two opposite transverse edges extending in the transverse direction. BACKGROUND For absorbent products such as sanitary napkins, panty liners and incontinence protectors that are provided to rest against the user's body when used, there are high requirements that they are discreet, soft and comfortable to wear and at the same time have a reliable security against leakage. A common problem associated with absorbent products of this type is that the product deforms during use since the product is pressed together between the user's thighs. This can bring it about that folds occur in an uncontrolled manner in the product. The folds bring it about that channels can form on the product surface and that the liquid runs out past the product's side edges and creates leakage. Furthermore, the compression of the product entails that the surface accessible for receiving liquid is reduced, whereby the risk that liquid ends up next to the product increases. The problem that undesired folds form commonly occurs, for example, when using airlaid, cellulose-based absorbent structures. In order to reduce the problem that the product deforms during use, in particular in the crotch part of the product, it proved to be advantageous to increase the stiffness of the product. Special materials with great stiffness, so-called stiffening elements, have been introduced into the product. Stiffening elements have the goal of retaining the shape of the product during use and in controlling the formation in such a manner as to prevent the development of leakage. The stiffening elements can be substantially two-dimensional, three-dimensional or initially substantially two-dimensional but when the product is used they expand and form a three-dimensional structure. Documents that describe absorbent products comprising forming- and/or stiffening elements and able to retain their form under load are, for example, WO 98/22057, WO 98/22058, WO 98/22061 and WO 98/22062. However, the skin in a user's crotch is relatively sensitive and a problem with using absorbent products with stiffening elements is that they can scrape the user's skin, for example, when the user moves. Furthermore a problem when using absorbent products such as nappies and sanitary napkins is that when there is repeated wetting of the product the liquid taken up during the first wetting should be conducted further from the wetting zone and the upper part of the absorption body nearest to the user to the lower part of the absorption body for absorption and storage. Furthermore, the absorbent product should be reliable such that the user trusts that the product will function well even given repeated wetting. SUMMARY The product described herein is soft and comfortable to wear at the same time that it exhibits satisfactory security against leakage. A product described herein has a liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer having a total surface in the plane extension of the product that covers the entire surface of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer in the plane extension and each of the longitudinally extending side edges of the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer extends at least along a part of its length outside of each of the longitudinally running side edges of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer, and the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer has an opacity greater than 35% and an absorption capacity lower than 0.15 of a gram of liquid/cm3 dry test material measured according to the CRCmaterial layer method, and the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer has a bending stiffness greater than 2.0 newtons measured according to the modified Circular Bend Procedure method. An advantage of the fact that the liquid-absorbent layer has a bending stiffness greater than 2.0 newtons is that this creates a relatively stiff and stable product that entails the fact that the liquid-absorbent layer also functions as a stiffening element. The bending stiffness brings it about that the product does not become so limp and that it cannot readily shrink together and create undesired folds in the crotch area. In order to simultaneously create a product that is soft, flexible and comfortable to wear, each longitudinal side edge of the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer extends at least along a part of its length outside of each longitudinally running side edge of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer. The liquid-receiving foam layer is an open-cell, flexible and pliable structure and the foam's pliability and flexibility reduces the risk of scrapes on account of the stiff edge parts on the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer. It turned out that liquid-receiving layers of airlaid, cellulose-based layers and liquid-receiving layers of non-woven material do not have the ability to reduce the negative effect of the stiff edges which a stiff cellulose-based absorption layer causes. Flexible foam materials can spring back, i.e., return to substantially their original shape after having been exposed to outer loading. Flexible foam materials also have a padding effect such that the foam material lines the stiff edges and creates a soft distancing element between the user's skin and the stiff edges of the liquid-absorbent layer. The liquid-receiving foam layer is an open-cell, continuous structure. Since the foam layer is a continuous structure, it exhibits good pliability and the ability to spring back after it has been exposed to an outer load. On the contrary, fibre- and/or filament-based liquid-receiving layers can be made of manifold discrete fibres and/or filaments that are often intermittently connected together to each other. However, the points where they are connected together do not create a continuous structure such as is created with a material formed by foam. Fibre- and/or filament-based layers therefore do not have as good an ability to spring back and resume their original form after an outer loading. Liquid-receiving foam layers have a good ability to resume their original form in all directions after an outer loading. Furthermore, the liquid-receiving foam layer is open-celled and in this manner retains a good liquid-receiving ability. The pliability and the ability to spring back of the open-cell, liquid-receiving foam layer also brings it about that there is less risk for folds to be produced or that the layer shrinks in comparison to layers based on fibres and/or filaments. The liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer can be made of thermoplastic foam or thermosetting foams. Examples of usable foams are polyolefin-based foam, polystyrene-based foam, PVC foam, polyvinyl alcohol foam, acrylate foam, for example, manufactured according to HIPE technology, polyurethane foam, epoxy foam, latex foam, urea-formaldehyde foam, melamine-formaldehyde foam, silicone foam, viscose foam, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) foam, starch form, chitosan foam, alginate foam, polyactide foam, polyglycolide foam and polycaprolactone foam. The surface of the liquid-absorbent layer in the plane extension can have local differences in the bending stiffness. However, the bending stiffness over any area of the surface of the liquid-absorbent layer should be greater than 2.0 newtons, i.e., the liquid-absorbent layer has a bending stiffness that is greater than 2.0 newtons in accordance with embodiments of the invention if any area of the liquid-absorbent layer has this according to the modified Circular Bend Procedure method. An advantage of a liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer with a low absorption capacity in gram liquid/cm3 is that a smaller area is wetted on the material layer than for a material layer that has a high absorption capacity in gram liquid/cm3. A liquid-receiving layer with a low absorption capacity has a good capacity to drain the liquid to an underlying liquid-absorbent layer. Furthermore, an advantage with liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layers with a low absorption capacity in gram liquid/cm3 is that the surface of the material layer is dryer after wetting than a material layer with a higher absorption capacity. Furthermore, it proved to be an advantage especially for sanitary pads that are to absorb menstrual liquid, which has a strong colour, that the absorbed liquid that is absorbed into the product is not very visible. Due to the fact that the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer has an opacity that is greater than 35%, it turned out that the user experiences the product as more pleasing than a product that has liquid-receiving layers that are not as opaque, for example, fibre layers of airy, non-woven material. It is also important that the user finds before using the product that it is a reliable and aesthetically pleasing product. Due to the fact that the liquid-receiving layer has an opacity that is greater than 35%, the difference in size of the layers in the absorption body is not seen as distinctly, which gives a more reliable impression of the product even before use. According to another embodiment the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer has an opacity greater than 50%. According to another embodiment, the surface of the liquid-absorbent layer in the plane extension has at least two different areas with a bending stiffness that is greater than 2.0 newtons according to the modified Circular Bend Procedure method. The surface, that has a bending stiffness that is greater than 2.0 newtons according to the modified Circular Bend Procedure method, should be able to be measured on two different areas on the surface of the liquid-absorbent layer, which two areas can be located adjacent to one another or be placed separated from one another. According to another embodiment, the liquid-absorbent layer has a bending stiffness that is greater than 2.0 newtons according to the modified Circular Bend Procedure method over its entire surface. According to an embodiment, the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer has a density that is less than 40 kg/m3, or less than 35 kg/m3. A liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer with a low density in combination with an open structure has the ability to receive a relatively large amount of liquid in a short time. Furthermore, it is advantageous that the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer has a density that is lower than the density of the underlying fibrous, liquid-absorbent layer. By virtue of having such a density gradient in the direction of the thickness of the absorption body, the draining of the liquid from the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer to the liquid-absorbent layer is favoured, i.e., the liquid is drawn down more readily to the underlying fibrous liquid-absorbent layer. According to an embodiment, the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer has a density in the dry state that is at least 3 times greater than the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer's density in the dry state, at least 4 times greater, or at least 5 times greater. Another advantage of the foams that are used in embodiments of the invention is that they are less hydrophilic than the fibre-based liquid-receiving foams that we tested. By virtue of the fact that the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer has a low density, such as less than 40 kg/m3 and relatively large open pores, it can receive a large amount of liquid in a short time, which creates a rapid admission. By virtue of the fact that the liquid-receiving, open-cell structure facilitates a rapid admission, this brings it about that the layer does not need to be very hydrophilic in order to nevertheless function well. A relatively great difference between the lower hydrophilicity of the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer and the higher hydrophilicity of the liquid-absorbent layer favours the draining of liquid from the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer to the liquid-absorbent fibrous layer. According to one embodiment, the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer has a bending stiffness that is less than 0.30 newtons measured according to the modified Circular Bend Procedure method. According to another embodiment, each longitudinal side edge of the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer extends at least 5.0 millimetres outside of each longitudinally running side edge of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer. The width of the surface of the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam material in the longitudinal direction of the product extending outside of the surface of the underlying liquid-absorbent layer should be adapted in such a manner that a good flexibility is obtained. In certain embodiments, the width on each longitudinally running side edge of the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer extending outside of the underlying, absorbent fibrous layer is between 5-15 mm. As was previously described, the flexible foam material has a padding effect such that the foam material lines the stiff edges. In certain embodiments, a good padding effect is observed when that distance is 5-15 mm. As was also described previously, the ability of the foam material to spring back, i.e., to return to substantially its original form after having been exposed to outer loading is a desirable property. The foam material has the ability to regain its original form in all directions, not only in the direction of the thickness of the material. This can be desirable when functioning as a soft and protective distancing layer between the user's skin and the stiff edges of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer. In certain embodiments, each longitudinally running side edge of the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer extends outside of each longitudinally running side edge of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer along its entire length. An advantage of such an embodiment is that such a product is experienced as soft and is more aesthetically pleasing. According to another embodiment, the total surface of the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer in its plane extension is at least 1.7 times as great as the total surface of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer in the plane extension of the product. The total surface of the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer in its plane extension being at least 1.7 times as great as the surface of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer provides a product that is soft and pliable. For some products, for example, for a panty liner, that does not need to be able to absorb an equally great volume of menstrual liquid, the total surface of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer does not need to be equally great, which brings it about that for such products it can be advantageous if the total surface of the liquid-receiving foam layer in its plane extension is at least 2.0 times as great as the total surface of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer in the plane extension of the product. By virtue of the fact that the open-cell, liquid-receiving foam layer has an opacity that is greater than 35%, the difference in size on the absorbent layers is not seen as clearly, which makes the product more aesthetically pleasing and gives the product a more reliable impression. Therefore, a high opacity of the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer is especially advantageous for products with a large difference of the surface between the liquid-receiving layer and the liquid-absorbent layer. A small surface of the liquid-absorbent layer can be desirable for certain products, in part for making them thin and discreet and in part for reducing the material cost. Furthermore, an advantage with a large difference on the surface between the liquid-receiving layer and the liquid-absorbent layer is that when the liquid-absorbent layer also functions as a shaping element that follows the body when it moves, a certain difference of the layers can be useful for retaining the desired shaping. According to an embodiment, the product also includes a liquid-permeable surface material and a backsheet material that is liquid-tight, wherein the absorption body is arranged between the liquid-permeable surface material and the liquid-tight backsheet material, and the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer is placed against the liquid-permeable surface material and the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer is placed against the liquid-tight backsheet material. However, it is also possible that the absorbent product does not have a separate liquid-permeable surface material. In such an embodiment, the liquid-receiving layer is placed closest to the user when the product is being used and thus the surface closest to the user includes a flexible foam. An advantage of such an embodiment is that the surface closest to the user is soft, smooth and pliable and that the number of layers used in the product is less, which simplifies the manufacturing process and possibly also reduces the material cost. According to another embodiment, the product further includes a front part, a back part and a crotch part located between the back part and the front part, wherein the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer extends in the longitudinal direction of the product over the crotch part and at least in part over the front part and that it has a width (M) in the transition between the crotch part and the front part which is less than 40 mm, and that the side edges of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer diverge in the direction from the transition between the crotch part and the front part to at least a little over the front part. The absorbent product is a sanitary napkin, a panty liner or an incontinence protector.

FIG. 3 shows a section along line II-II through an alternative embodiment of the sanitary napkin in FIG. 1. FIG. 4 shows another alternative embodiment of the sanitary napkin in FIG. 1 viewed from above. FIG. 5 shows a photo that compares the spreading of liquid in the sanitary napkin in accordance with an embodiment of the invention with a sanitary napkin in accordance with the prior art. DESCRIPTION OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS The sanitary pad 100 shown in the FIGS. 1 and 2 is elongated with a longitudinal direction and a transverse direction. The sanitary napkin 100 includes a liquid-permeable surface material 101 arranged on the top side of the sanitary napkin, i.e., the side of the sanitary napkin intended to be turned toward a user during use, a liquid-tight backsheet material 102, and an absorption body 103 arranged between the surface material 101 and the backsheet material 102. The absorption body 103 includes a liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer 104 placed against the liquid-permeable surface material 101 and a liquid-absorbent fibrous layer 105 placed against the liquid-tight backsheet material 102, whereby the liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer 104 includes two opposing, longitudinally running side edges 106, 107 extending in the longitudinal direction and two opposing transverse edges 108, 109 extending in the transverse direction, and the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer 105 includes two opposing longitudinally running side edges 110, 111 extending in the longitudinal direction, and two opposing transverse edges 112, 113 extending in the transverse direction. The liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer 104 has a total surface in the plane extension of the product that covers the entire surface of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer 105 in its plane extension, and each longitudinally running side edge 106, 107 of the liquid-receiving foam layer 104 extends at least along a part of its length outside of each longitudinally running side edge 110, 111 of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer. Furthermore, the liquid-absorbent open-cell foam layer 104 has a permeability to air that is greater than 200 m3/m2/min and an opacity that is greater than 35%. The liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer 105 has a bending stiffness that is greater than 3.0 newtons. The surface material 101 and the backsheet material 102 have substantially the same plane form as the absorption body 103 but have a somewhat greater extension in the plane, as a result of which they form a projecting edge 117 around the entire periphery of the absorption body 103. Cover layers 102, 103 are mutually connected inside the projecting edge 117, for example, by, gluing, sewing or welding with heat or ultrasound. The sanitary napkin in FIG. 1 is formed with a front part 114, a back part 115 and an intermediate crotch part 116. The front part 114 has a rounded form and is wider than the crotch part 116. It turned out that all users have a critical area between the groins wherein the distance between the muscles running down on the inside of the thighs is approximately 30-35 mm. The width of the sanitary napkin in the crotch area is limited in front by this distance between the muscle sinews right in front of the users' groins. Thus, in the transition between the crotch part 116 and the front part 114 the liquid-absorbent layer 105 has a distance M that does not exceed 40 mm, or is 30-35 mm. For the sanitary napkin 100, it is the width of the liquid-absorbent layer 105 in the transition between the crotch part 116 and the front part 114 that should not be too wide. The reason it is the width of the liquid-absorbent layer 105 in the crotch part 116 of the product which is limited is that it is this layer that contributes to the product's stiffness. In the direction back from this transition with width M to the end of the crotch part the width of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer 105, that also functions as a stiffening element, can continuously increase to a magnitude of size 1.5 times the width M. A relatively narrow distance M, at least on the liquid-absorbent layer 105, is also an advantage from the viewpoint of fastening, since a sanitary pad where the difference in width between the front part 114 and the width of the narrowest part on the crotch part 116 is large, yields a good fastening effect against the user's legs and prevents the sanitary napkin from gliding backwards during use. The liquid-permeable surface material 101 is suitably made of a conventional liquid-permeable material. Examples of suitable materials are perforated plastic films, non-woven mats, plastic nets or the like. The liquid-tight backsheet material 102 is a conventional type and can thus be made of any liquid-tight material suitable for the purpose. Examples of such materials are various types of thin plastic films or non-woven materials treated to resist the penetration of liquid, for example, by being coated with plastic, wax or the like. Even other treatments such as heat calendering for melting a material that was permeable in the beginning to a mainly liquid-tight layer can be used. Furthermore, the liquid-tight backsheet material 103 can be made of a liquid-tight surface on absorption body 103. In order to produce an airy product, the liquid-tight backsheet material is customarily breathable, i.e., has a good air permeability. According to certain embodiments, the liquid-tight backsheet material consists of a breathable material. Examples of breathable materials are perforated films, microporous films, macroporous films, nanoporous films, monolithic films, fibrous non-woven ones and their laminates. An example of a liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer 105 with a high absorption capacity and a good capacity for transporting liquid is the fibrous material described in WO 94/10953 and WO 94/10956. These materials are present in the form of dry-formed fibre layers with a high density and stiffness and are used directly in an absorbent product without being defibrated at first. The stiffening and absorbent element can also be made from a laminate of several non-woven layers or tissue layers that are mutually fixed for increased stiffness and that have highly absorbent particles between individual layers. The fixing of the individual layers to each other can take place with binding agents such as adhesive or melted fibres. The highly absorbent particles can also contribute to the bonding. The stiffness is controlled by selecting the number of layers and the amount of binding agent used and by the selection of highly absorbent material and how its adhesive capacity is utilized. Another example of material in the liquid-absorbent layer is one or more layers of airlaid cellulose layers. This can be prefabricated material which is supplied in roll form for being then cut out in a suitable size, or alternatively the liquid-absorbent layer can be mat-formed and formed in-line during the manufacture itself of the absorbent product. For example, to obtain compression lines/compression zones it can be purposeful to have the areas that are compressed at a higher bending stiffness than the surrounding areas. Such a further compression can take place in combination with the compression of the liquid-absorbent layer. Alternatively, a pattern compression can take place in a separate step after the flat compression. The compression of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer can be made in several ways. An example of a process is one that is called โhigh-density compressionโ (HDC) that is described in detail in EP-B-1427658. The compression can be made in two to three steps that include a preliminary compression and thereafter a compression in one or two steps. It is also possible to perform the compression in one step. The surface of the liquid-absorbent layer in plane extension can exhibit local differences in bending stiffness. However, in certain embodiments, it is desired that the bending stiffness over one area on the surface of the liquid-absorbent layer is greater than 2.0 newtons, i.e., the liquid-absorbent layer has a bending stiffness greater than 2.0 newtons according to the modified Circular Bend Procedure method in any area of the liquid-absorbent layer. According to another embodiment, the surface of the liquid-absorbent layer in its plane extension includes at least two different areas with a bending stiffness that is greater than 2.0 newtons according to the modified bending stiffness method. It includes the fact that the surface that has a bending stiffness greater than 2.0 newtons according to the modified Circular Bend Procedure method should be able to be measured on two different areas on the surface of the liquid-absorbent layer, which two areas can be adjacent to one another or can be placed at a distance from one another. In certain embodiments, the liquid-absorbent layer has a bending stiffness greater than 2.0 newtons according to the modified Circular Bend Procedure method over the entire liquid-absorbent layer. According to this embodiment, no area on the liquid-absorbent layer may have a bending stiffness that is 2.0 newtons or less when measured according to the modified Circular Bend Procedure method. A suitable liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer 104 is polyurethane foam. Polyurethane is a two-component product made of polyol and isocyanate that are mixed to polyurethane foam. Polyurethane has either open or closed cells. For being used as a liquid-receiving foam layer in an absorbent product, polyurethane foam is used with open cells. Furthermore, polyurethane foam can have different stiffness and for our purpose can be viewed as flexible foams. The liquid-receiving foam is flexible with a low bending stiffness and springs back well, i.e., after being loaded the foam returns to substantially its original form. The liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer can be thermoplastic foam or thermosetting foams. Examples of useable foams are polyolefin-based foam, polystyrene-based foam, PVC foam, polyvinyl alcohol foam, acrylate foam, for example, manufactured according to HIPE technology, polyurethane foam, epoxy foam, latex foam, urea-formaldehyde foam, melamine-formaldehyde foam, silicone foam, viscose foam, carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) foam, starch foam, chitosan foam, alginate foam, polyactide foam, polyglycolide foam and polycaprolactone foam. A fastening element in the form of a rectangular area extending in the longitudinal direction and made of self-adhesive glue is arranged on the outside of the liquid-tight backsheet layer. When the sanitary napkin 100 is being used, it is placed inside the user's underpants and is fastened in the underpants with the aid of the fastening element. Before being used, the fastening element is protected in a conventional manner, for example, by being covered by a protective layer of paper or plastic treated with silicone, or is embossed so that it can be readily separated from the glue when the sanitary napkin is to be used. The glue can obviously be alternatively arranged in any pattern suitable for the purpose such as a plurality of longitudinally running strands, an entire covering, arranged in areas only at the front part and/or the back part or the like. Furthermore, other types of fastening elements can be used such as friction covering, press studs, clamps, fastening flaps or the like. FIG. 3 shows a transverse section of an alternative embodiment of the sanitary napkin 100. The liquid-receiving foam layer 104 has a total surface in the plane extension of the product that is substantially the same as the surface of the liquid-permeable surface material 101 and substantially the same as the surface of the liquid-tight backsheet material 102. The liquid-permeable surface material 101 includes two opposing, longitudinally running side edges 124, 125 extending in the longitudinal direction and the liquid-tight backside material 102 includes two opposing longitudinally running side edges 126, 127 extending in the longitudinal direction. Thus, the two opposing side edges 106, 107 of the open-cell, liquid-receiving foam layer 104, which side edges extend in the longitudinal direction, coincide substantially with the longitudinally running side edges 124, 125 of the liquid-permeable surface material and the longitudinally running side edges 126, 127 of the liquid-tight backsheet material. Thus, the surface material 101, backsheet material 102 and the liquid-receiving foam layer 104 include a projecting edge 117 around the entire periphery of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer 105. Cover layers 102, 103 and the liquid-receiving foam layer 104 are mutually connected inside the projecting edge 117, for example, by gluing, sewing or welding with heat or ultrasound. Therefore, the surface of the liquid-receiving foam layer 104 extends in its plane extension outside of each longitudinally running side edge 110, 111 of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer 105 and of each transversely running side edge 112, 113 of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer 105. Furthermore, FIG. 4 shows an alternative embodiment of the sanitary napkin 100. FIG. 4 shows the sanitary napkin from the top. The liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer 105 includes a shape like a keyhole. The liquid-receiving foam layer 104 also has a shape like a keyhole but with a greater extension in the longitudinal direction as well as in the transverse direction than the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer 105. The liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer 105 can also be intended to function as a stiffening element and is designed to reduce the risk that the sanitary pad deforms in an uncontrolled manner. The liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer 105 has a size, shape and stiffness that bring it about that the product retains during the entire time of use a predetermined shape and furthermore is held fast at the intended location on the user. The liquid-absorbent layer has a width M in the transition between the crotch part 116 and the front part 114 which width is less than 40 mm, or 30-35 mm. Both side edges of the front part 114 diverge in a forward direction in the product from this transition M. In this manner, it is prevented that the product is shifted backwards between the user's legs. In FIG. 4, there is an angle between a line in the longitudinal direction of the product and each of the side edges of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer in the front part designated with a. In the case of a large angle ฮฑ, for example, in the vicinity of 90ยฐ, the edges of the front part can scrape against the users groins and legs, thus creating discomfort for the user. The smaller the angle ฮฑ is, the greater the risk that the product slides backwards in between the user's legs. At an angle below 30ยฐ this risk is unacceptably great. In certain embodiments, an angle between 35-40ยฐ gives an optimal balance between a firm hold and comfort. The sanitary napkin 100 in FIG. 4 is formed with a crotch length adapted to the user's anatomy. In a sanitary napkin as described herein, the fact was utilized that most women have a crotch length with a size of 80-100 mm. Therefore, the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer 105 was created with a corresponding crotch length G with the size of 70-120 mm. Along the crotch, where the user's body shape is substantially plane, the sanitary napkin is shaped so as to be relatively stiff laterally, i.e., it is sufficiently stiff so as to not be deformed laterally and form folds. Since it is important that the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer has a good absorption capacity, it is important to be able to utilize accessible space between the user's legs in the crotch. The width of the sanitary napkin in the crotch area is limited in front by this distance between these muscle sinews right in front of the user's groins. In the direction backwards from these transition areas to the end of the crotch part the width of the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer 105, that also functions as a stiffening element, can continuously increase to the size of 1.5 times the width M without the risk that the liquid-absorbent layer 105 scrapes the user in the crotch. The liquid-absorbent layer 105 extends slightly over the product's back part 115. The liquid-absorbent layer 105 has a recess 120 in the back part 115 and extending from its end edge and in the direction toward the crotch part 116 by means of which the product can fold along a longitudinally running line in the recess and by means of which the parts, the legs 121 and 122, that are located on both sides of the recess 120, become more flexible than the wider crotch part 116. This recess 120 is for obtaining a good adaptation to and pliability with the body. The fold which develops in the recess when the product is being used can pass into the user's posterior notch, thus offering a very good protection against leakage via the posterior notch, which type of leakage occurs when using sanitary pads when the user is lying on her back. Furthermore, the recess 120 makes it possible that these legs 121, 122 can be mutually shifted vertically during various body movements, for example, when the user is walking. In the exemplary embodiment shown in FIG. 4, the recess 120 is wedge-shaped and symmetrically located relative to the longitudinally running line of symmetry L of the product and forms an angle ฮฒ with a magnitude of 20ยฐ. This angle can vary within broad limits but is of course dependent on the shape of the back part 115. FIG. 5 shows a photo of two sanitary napkins seen from above, 500A and 500B. The sanitary napkin 500 A is a sanitary napkin in accordance with an embodiment of the invention with a liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layer of polyurethane from FoamPartner, product name Regilen 30WF and the sanitary napkin 500B is a sanitary napkin with a fibrous liquid-receiving layer, a cellulose-based, multi-bound airlaid from Glatfelter Falkenhagen GmbH, product code MH080.137. Otherwise, both sanitary napkins have exactly the same construction. Both sanitary napkins have a liquid-absorbent layer of cellulose-based airlaid with 25 weight percent SAP. Liquid was applied to the crotch part of the sanitary napkins in three sequential instances, three sequential dosages. In each dosage, 3.0 ml synthetic menstrual liquid was applied, which means that a total of 9.0 ml synthetic menstrual liquid was applied. As the photo shows, the liquid in the sanitary napkin 500B with a fibrous, liquid-receiving layer spread out in the transverse direction of the product toward the side edges of the napkin, which is not desirable. Embodiments of the invention were described above in conjunction with a sanitary napkin. However, the invention also relates to panty liners and incontinence protectors.

In order to measure the average density of a material layer in an absorbent product, it is essential that the various material layers included in the absorbent product are separated with caution. The material specimen to be measured is clipped out of the material layer. A loading pressure of 0.5 kPa is applied to the material specimen by a foot with an area of 45ร45 mm and that is less than the area of the material specimen. Then the thickness of the material specimen is measured. The basis rate of the material sample, i.e., gram/cm2, is weighed and calculated forward. Then, the average density of the material specimen is calculated by dividing the base rate by the thickness. Result: Material Thickness Density (kg/m3) 1 2.0 31 2 2.0 29 3 2.0 29 4 2.8 31 5 1.7 10 6 2.1 23 7 1.6 30 8 1.3 65 9 2.5 205 10 1.6 300 11 1.4 216 12 1.0 350 13 0.8 330 Measuring of the absorption capacity in accordance with CRCmateriallayer CRCmatenallayer is based on WSP 241.3, which is a standard method for super-absorbent polyacrylate in powder form or granular form. WSP 241.3 is modified in accordance with the following in order to adapt the method to sheet- and mat-formed materials with a thickness of 0.5 mm-4.0 mm measured under a load of 0.5 kPa. The following modifications were made: The nonwoven bag: According to WSP 241.3 the non-woven bag has a size between 60ร40 mm2 and 60-85 mm2. For example, a non-woven bag that was 90ร90 mm2 was used. According to the method description for WSP 241.3 the size for the non-woven bag is indicated in paragraph 3 โTerms and definitionsโ, in paragraph 6.1 โApparatusโ and in paragraph 8.1 โProcedureโ. The analysis scale: According to WSP 241.3 the analysis scale should be able to weigh a mass between 0.180-0.220 grams. For measuring, the analysis scale should be able to weigh a mass between 0.200-3000 grams. The centrifuging was carried out in accordance with WSP 241.3, wherein the acceleration was 95 g and an inside diameter of the โbasket or rotor meshโ of 235 mm was used. Test sample: According to WSP 241.3 between 0.180 grams and 0.220 grams of super-absorbent are weighed and placed in a teabag (non-woven bag), see paragraph 8.3 Procedure. When measuring, the stamped-out, circular sample material with a diameter of 80 mm is weighed and placed in the teabag (non-woven bag). According to WSP 241.3, see paragraph 8.4, the dry polymer is weighed. When measuring, the stamped-out, circular sample material is weighed. According to WSP 241.3, see paragraph 8.8, at least 1 litre saline solution per 10 teabags (non-woven bags) is used. When measuring, at least 1 litre saline solution per 4 teabags (non-woven bags) is used. According to WSP 241.3, see paragraphs 8.13 and 8.14, the test sample should absorb the saline solution in under 30 minutes. When measuring, the test sample should absorb the saline solution in under 10 minutes. According to WSP 241.3, see paragraph 8.17, the centrifuge is adjusted to obtain a centrifugal acceleration of 250 g. When measuring, the centrifuge is adjusted for obtaining a centrifugal acceleration of 95 g. According to WSP 241.3, see paragraph 8.22 and 8.23, โPA super-absorbent gelโ is present. When measuring, the stamped-out, circular sample material is concerned. According to WSP 241.3, see paragraph 9.10, โpolymer-based absorbent materialsโ are present. When measuring, the stamped-out, circular sample material is concerned. According to WSP 241.3, see paragraph 9.11, gram per gram (gยทgโ1) is present. When measuring, gram/cm3dry material is concerned. Result: Material Absorption capacity (gram liquid/cm3 dry material) 1 0.14 2 0.12 3 0.06 4 0.05 5 0.13 6 0.09 7 0.04 8 0.30 9 0.91 10 3.10 11 1.66 12 1.40 13 2.18 In certain embodiments, an absorption capacity less than 0.15 gram liquid/cm3 dry material is used for the liquid-receiving layer. CRCmaterial layer is a method that measures the absorption capacity in gram liquid/cm3dry material and is a measure for how readily a material layer is drained of liquid. A low CRCmaterial layer value, i.e., a low absorption capacity in gram liquid/cm3, is obtained for liquid-receiving layers with a good drainage. A high CRCmaterial layer value, i.e., a high absorption capacity in gram liquid/cm3dry material is obtained for liquid-receiving layers that have a low drainage. A reason for measuring the absorption capacity in gram liquid/cm3 dry material instead of measuring the absorption capacity in gram liquid/gram dry material, i.e., in volume unit instead of weight unit, is that a thin material is desirable for obtaining a comfortable and discreet product so therefore the thickness of the liquid-receiving layer is more relevant than the weight of the liquid-receiving layer. In order that a thin material will be able to obtain a good liquid-receiving capacity, in part upon a first wetting but also upon repeated wetting, it advantageously has an open structure with large pores, than entails a structure with a low density. A material with low density can receive a greater amount of liquid per volume unit (cm3) than a material with a higher density. Furthermore, the good liquid-receiving capacity is retained in this manner even upon repeated wetting of the liquid-receiving layer, that effectively drains the liquid to the underlying absorption layer in spite of the fact that the material is thin. When the draining is good, i.e., a low absorption capacity in gram liquid/cm3, a smaller area of the material layer is wetted than in the case of a material layer that has low drainage, i.e., a high absorption capacity in gram liquid/cm3. Furthermore, an advantage with liquid-receiving, open-cell foam layers with a low absorption capacity in gram liquid/cm3 is the fact the surface of the material layer after wetting is dryer than a material layer with a higher absorption capacity. On the other hand, for the liquid-absorbent, fibrous layer it is desirable to have a high absorption capacity in gram liquid/cm3. Description of the Method for the Modified Circular Bend Procedure The method for the modified Circular Bend procedure was carried out in accordance with a modified version of ASTM D 4032-82 (Circular Bend Procedure). The method for the modified Circular Bend Procedure is described in detail in EP 336 578. The measuring was carried out in the same manner as described in EP 336 578. The apparatus used was Instron Model Mo. 5965. Instron Model No. 5965 is manufactured by the Instron Engineering Corporation. The bending resistance in the material sample was measured by measuring the maximum bending stiffness. According to the method, the maximum bending stiffness is constituted by a simultaneous deformation in several directions of a material sample, wherein one of the surfaces of the material sample becomes concave and the other surface of the material sample becomes convex. The method for the modified Circular Bend Procedure supplies a force value that concerns the bending resistance, i.e., simultaneous medium stiffness in all directions. The equipment used for the method of the modified Circular Bend Procedure is a modified Circular Bend Stiffness Tester that has the following parts: A smooth-polished steel plate with measurements 102.0ร102.0ร635 mm that has a circular opening with a diameter of 18.75 mm. The circular opening has a bevelled edge that is 45 degrees to a depth of 4.75 mm. A pressure rod with a total length of 72.2 mm, a diameter of 6.25 and a spherical end with a radius of 2.97 mm was used. A sharp needle tip projects 0.88 mm out from the spherical end. The pressure rod was mounted concentrically and has the same magnitude of play in all directions. The end of the pressure rod is placed well over the plate with the circular opening. From this position the downwardly directed strike of the spherical tip is so long that it precisely extends to the bottom of the circular opening of the plate. However, an indication of the distance of the needle tip (0.88 mm) is not included. A tester of draught and compression with a loading cell adapted for Instron Model No. 5965 was used. Production of Test Materials and Calculation of the Average Value: The liquid-receivingโrespectively the liquid-absorbent material layer from five absorbent products was measured and then the average value was calculated. In those cases where the liquid-absorbent layer includes areas with different bending stiffnesses, for example, an area that is more compressed than an adjacent area, the liquid-absorbent layer falls within the scope of protection since any area has a bending stiffness that is greater than 2.0 newtons. In those cases where the liquid-receiving foam layer includes areas with different bending stiffnesses, for example, an area that is more compressed than an adjacent area, the liquid-receiving foam layer falls in a corresponding manner within the scope of protection since any area has a bending stiffness that is less than that which is indicated in the claim. When measuring material layers in an absorbent product, it is important that the liquid-receiving foam layer is separated from the liquid-absorbent layer with great care so that the material layers do not break into pieces during the separating. Implementation: The implementation was made exactly in accordance with the description in EP 0 336 578 A1. The material specimens are stamped out or cut out and have an area of 37.5ร37.5 mm. The material specimens were conditioned for two hours at a temperature of 21ยฑ1ยฐ C. and a relative air humidity of 50ยฑ2%. The pressure rod should be moved downward at a rate of 50.0 cm/min. The material specimen is then placed centred over the opening of the steel plate. The surface of the material specimen that is turned in the product towards the liquid-permeable surface material was turned in the taking of the specimen towards the pressure rod and the surface of the material sample that was turned in the product towards the liquid-impervious backside material was turned in the taking of the specimen towards the steel plate. The pressure plate was then put in motion and the maximum force was measured. The value of the maximum force was rounded off to the nearest gram. Result: Material Bending stiffness (newtons) 1 0.29 2 0.16 3 0.20 4 0.10 5 0.27 6 0.18 7 0.07 8 0.59 9 3.43 10 2.28 11 3.40 12 6.55 13 2.94 Materials 1-8 are liquid-receiving layers. The result shows that layers 1-6 that are open-cell foam materials and also material 7, that is a carded through air-bound nonwoven material, have a bending stiffness that is lower than 0.30 newtons. In contrast thereto, material 8, which is a cellulose-based, multi-bound airlaid, exhibits a bending stiffness that is greater than 0.30 newtons. Materials 9-13 are liquid-absorbent layers that exhibit a bending stiffness greater than 2.0 newtons. Opacity The measurements were carried out in accordance with EDANA's method WSP 60.1. Opacity is a concept and a magnitude in optics that is used to indicate transparency, that is, translucency. Opacity measures the degree of impenetrability for radiation through a material or transmission medium. Material that entirely lacks the ability to let light through is called opaque. The opacity was measured with a spectrophotometer with measurement in the YXY colour system (CIE 1931). The spectrophotometer used was of the brand Minolta Chroma Meter CR 300 (the y value was used) (CIE Illuminant D65). Calibration plate No. 16133079 was used as white standard background with a reflectance of 0.89. Black velvet was used as black standard background with a reflectance of 0.005. The implementation was made in accordance with EDANA's method WSP 60.1. The opacity (contrast ratio C0.89) is calculated as follows: Contrast ratio C0.89=Rb/Rwร100 Rb=brightness, a specimen piece against black standard background Rw=brightness, a specimen piece against white standard background The results are indicated with accuracy in whole numbers. Result: Material Opacity (contrast ratio C0.89, %) 1 57 2 37 3 39 5 48 6 37 7 67 8 31 The result shows that the foam materials, i.e., materials 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 have an opacity above 35%. Material 7, which is a cellulose-based material, also has an opacity that is over 35%. In contrast thereto, material 8, which is a carded through, air-bound non-woven material, has a lower opacity, 31%. Foam materials 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 as well as fibres/filaments in materials 7 and 8 are substantially white. However, it is also possible to have the materials in the layers coloured in other colours. 1.
