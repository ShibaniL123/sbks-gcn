Example 66A
Methyl 4-({[6-bromo-2-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-3-methylquinolin-4-yl]carbonyl}amino)bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylat
56 mg (0.15 mmol) of the compound from Example 32A were initially charged in 1.8 ml of DMF. Successively, 39 mg (0.18 mmol) of methyl 4-aminobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylate hydrochloride, 85 mg (0.22 mmol) of HATU and 0.10 ml (0.59 mmol) of DIPEA were added to the solution, and the mixture was subsequently stirred at 60Â° C. overnight. After cooling to RT, the mixture, without further work-up, was purified by preparative HPLC (Method 2). This gave 59 mg (73% of theory, purity 99%) of the title compound
