Field of the invention The present invention relates to an improved high-density polyethylene (HDPE), particularly adapted for the manufacture of caps and closures, which may for example be used as screw-on caps for carbonated or still drinks. Hence, the present invention also relates to such caps and closures as well as to their use. The technical problem and the prior art Polyethylene has become one of the materials of choice in the caps and closures market. This is because polyethylene offers a good balance of mechanical properties and can easily be processed either by injection molding or by compression molding. Recent efforts to reduce the weight of the polyethylene caps and closures now necessitate polyethylenes with improved properties. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a cap or closure comprising a polyethylene composition having improved rigidity. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a cap or closure comprising a polyethylene composition with improved ESCR properties. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a cap or closure comprising a polyethylene with good processability in injection molding or compression molding or both. It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a cap or closure having acceptable organoleptic properties. Brief description of the invention It has now surprisingly been found that the above objectives can be attained either individually or in any combination by a cap or closure comprising the specific and well-defined polyethylene composition as disclosed herein. Cap or closure comprising a polyethylene composition having a density of at least 940 kg/m3 and of at most 970 kg/m3 and a high load melt index HLMI of at least 35 dg/min and of at most 180 dg/min, wherein the density is determined according to ISO 1183 at 23°C, wherein the HLMI is determined according to ISO 1133, condition G, at 190°C and 21.6 kg; said polyethylene composition consisting of a first polyethylene fraction and a second polyethylene fraction, wherein the first polyethylene fraction has a density of at least 920 kg/m3 and of at most 945 kg/m3 and a melt index HL275 of at least 3 dg/min and of at most 12 dg/min, wherein melt index HL275 is determined in the same way as the HLMI except that the die opening has a diameter 2.75 mm, HL275 can be converted to HLMI using the following equation HLMI=HL275/3.2, and wherein the second polyethylene fraction has a density of at least 965 kg/m3 and of at most 980 kg/m3; with the provision that the density and melt index of the second polyethylene fraction are chosen such that density and melt index of the polyethylene composition are as defined herein ,and with properties calculated using the following equations logHLMIblend=w1•logHLMI1+w2•logHlMI2dblend=w1•d1+w2•d2 with HLMIblend being the high load melt index HLMI of the polyethylene composition, HLMI1 being the high load melt index HLMI of the first polyethylene fraction, HLMI2 being the high load melt index of the second polyethylene fraction, dblend being the density of the polyethylene composition, d1 being the density of the first polyethylene fraction, d2 being the density of the second polyethylene fraction, w1 being the wt% of the first and w2 being the wt% of the second polyethylene fraction, relative to the total weight of the polyethylene composition.

According to one embodiment of the invention, a method for making a catalyst component generally includes the steps of forming a metal dialkoxide from a metal dialkyl and an alcohol, halogenating the metal dialkoxide to form a reaction product, contacting the reaction product with one or more halogenating/titanating agent in three or more steps to form a catalyst component, and then treating the catalyst component with a preactivation agent such as an organoaluminum. One embodiment of the present invention can be generally as follows: 1. MRR'+2R"OH→M(OR")22. M(OR")2+ClAR"'x→"A"3. "A" + TiCl4/Ti (OR"")4 → "B"4. "B" + TiCl4 → "C";5. "C" + TiCl4 → "D"6. "D" + preactivating agent → catalyst In the above formulas, M can be any suitable metal, usually a Group IIA metal, typically Mg. In the above formulas, R, R', R", R"', and R"" are each independently hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl moieties, with R and R' having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, generally from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, typically from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, and can have from 2 to 4 carbon atoms.

Any combination of two or more of R, R', R", R"', and R"" can be used, may be the same, or the combination of the R groups may be different from one another. In the above embodiment comprising formula ClAR"'x, A is a non-reducing oxophilic compound which is capable of exchanging one chloride for an alkoxide, R"' is a hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl, and x is the valence of A minus 1. Examples of A include titanium, silicon, aluminum, carbon, tin and germanium, typically is titanium or silicon wherein x is 3. Examples of R'" include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl having 2-6 carbon atoms. Non-limiting examples of a chlorinating agent that can be used in the present invention are ClTi(OiPr)3 and ClSi(Me)3. The metal dialkoxide of the above embodiment is chlorinated to form a reaction product "A". While the exact composition of product "A" is unknown, it is believed that it contains a partially chlorinated metal compound, one example of which may be ClMg(OR"). Reaction product "A" is then contacted with one or more halogenating/titanating agent, such as for example a combination of TiCl4 and Ti(OBu)4, to form reaction product "B". Reaction product "B" which is probably a complex of chlorinated and partially chlorinated metal and titanium compounds. Reaction product "B" can comprise a titanium impregnated MgCl2 support and for example, may possibly be represented by a compound such as (MCI 2)y (TiClx(OR)4-x)z. Reaction product "B" can be precipitated as a solid from the catalyst slurry. The second halogenation/titanation step produces reaction product, or catalyst component, "C" which is also probably a complex of halogenated and partially halogenated metal and titanium compounds but different from "B" and may possibly be represented by (MCl2)y (TiClx'(OR)4-x')z'. It is expected that the level of halogenation of "C" would be greater than that of product "B". This greater level of halogenation can produce a different complex of compounds. The third halogenation/titanation step produces a reaction product, or catalyst component, "D" which is also probably a complex of halogenated and partially halogenated metal and titanium compounds but different from "B" and "C", and may possibly be represented by (MCl2)y (TiClx"(OR)4-x")z". It is expected that the level of halogenation of "D" would be greater than that of product "C". This greater level of halogenation would produce a different complex of compounds. While this description of the reaction products offers the most probable explanation of the chemistry at this time, the invention as described in the claims is not limited by this theoretical mechanism. Metal dialkyls and the resultant metal dialkoxides suitable for use in the present invention can include any that can be utilized in the present invention to yield a suitable polyolefin catalyst. These metal dialkoxides and dialkyls can include Group IIA metal dialkoxides and dialkyls. The metal dialkoxide or dialkyl can be a magnesium dialkoxide or dialkyl. Non-limiting examples of suitable magnesium dialkyls include diethyl magnesium, dipropyl magnesium, dibutyl magnesium, butylethylmagnesium, Butylethylmagnesium (BEM) is one suitable magnesium dialkyl. In the practice of the present invention, the metal dialkoxide can be a magnesium compound of the general formula Mg(OR")2 where R" is a hydrocarbyl or substituted hydrocarbyl of 1 to 20 carbon atoms. The metal dialkoxide can be soluble and is typically non-reducing. A non-reducing compound has the advantage of forming MgCl2 instead of insoluble species that can be formed by the reduction of compounds such as MgRR', which can result in the formation of catalysts having a broad particle size distribution. In addition, Mg(OR")2, which is less reactive than MgRR', when used in a reaction involving chlorination with a mild chlorinating agent, followed by subsequent halogenation/titanation steps, can result in a more uniform product, e.g., better catalyst particle size control and distribution. Non-limiting examples of species of metal dialkoxides which can be used include magnesium butoxide, magnesium pentoxide, magnesium hexoxide, magnesium di(2-ethylhexoxide), and any alkoxide suitable for making the system soluble. As a non-limiting example, magnesium dialkoxide, such as magnesium di (2-ethylhexoxide), may be produced by reacting an alkyl magnesium compound (MgRR') with an alcohol (ROH), as shown below. MgRR'+ 2R"OH→Mg(OR")2+RH+R'H The reaction can take place at room temperature and the reactants form a solution. R and R' may each be any alkyl group of 1-10 carbon atoms, and may be the same or different. Suitable MgRR' compounds include, for example, diethyl magnesium, dipropyl magnesium, dibutyl magnesium and butyl ethyl magnesium. The MgRR' compound can be BEM, wherein RH and R'H are butane and ethane, respectively. In the practice of the present invention, any alcohol yielding the desired metal dialkoxide may be utilized. Generally, the alcohol utilized may be any alcohol of the general formula R"OH where R" is an alkyl group of 2-20 carbon atoms, the carbon atoms can be at least 3, at least 4, at least 5, or at least 6 carbon atoms. Non-limiting examples of suitable alcohols include ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, 2-methyl-pentanol, 2-ethylhexanol. While it is believed that almost any alcohol may be utilized, linear or branched, a higher order branched alcohol, for example, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol, can be utilized. The amount of alcohol added can vary, such as within a non-exclusive range of 0 to 10 equivalents, is generally in the range of 0.5 equivalents to 6 equivalents (equivalents are relative to the magnesium or metal compound throughout), and can be in the range of 1 to 3 equivalents. Alkyl metal compounds can result in a high molecular weight species that is very viscous in solution. This high viscosity may be reduced by adding to the reaction an aluminum alkyl such as, for example, triethylaluminum (TEAl), which can disrupt the association between the individual alkyl metal molecules. The typical ratio of alkyl aluminum to metal can range from 0.001:1 to 1:1, can be 0.01 to 0.5:1 and also can range from 0.03:1 to 0.2:1. In addition, an electron donor such as an ether, for example, diisoamyl ether (DIAE), may be used to further reduce the viscosity of the alkyl metal. The typical ratio of electron donor to metal ranges from 0:1 to 10:1 and can range from 0.1:1 to 1:1. Agents useful in the step of halogenating the metal alkoxide include any halogenating agent which when utilized in the present invention will yield a suitable polyolefin catalyst. The halogenating step can be a chlorinating step where the halogenating agent contains a chloride (i.e. is a chlorinating agent). Halogenating of the metal alkoxide compound is generally conducted in a hydrocarbon solvent under an inert atmosphere. Non-limiting examples of suitable solvents include toluene, heptane, hexane, octane. this halogenating step, the mole ratio of metal alkoxide to halogenating agent is generally in the range of 6:1 to 1:3, can be in the range of 3:1 to 1:2, can be in the range of 2:1 to 1:2, and can also be about 1:1. The halogenating step is generally carried out at a temperature in the range of about 0° C to about 100° C and for a reaction time in the range of 0.5 to 24 hours. The halogenating step can be carried out at a temperature in the range of 20° C to 90° C and for a reaction time in the range of 1 hour to 4 hours. Once the halogenating step is carried out and the metal alkoxide is halogenated, the halide product "A" can be subjected to two or more halogenating/titanating treatments. The halogenation/titanation agents utilized can be blends of two tetra-substituted titanium compounds with all four substituents being the same and the substituents being a halide or an alkoxide or phenoxide with 2 to 10 carbon atoms, such as TiCl4 or Ti(OR"")4. The halogenation/titanation agent utilized can be a chlorination/titanation agent. The halogenation/titanation agent may be a single compound or a combination of compounds. The method of the present invention provides an active catalyst after the first halogenation/titanation; however, there are desirably a total of at least three halogenation/titanation steps. The first halogenation/titanation agent is typically a mild titanation agent, which can be a blend of a titanium halide and an organic titanate. The first halogenation/titanation agent can be a blend of TiCl4 and Ti(OBu)4 in a range from 0.5:1 to 6:1 TiCl4/Ti(OBu)4, the ratio can be from 2:1 to 3:1. It is believed that the blend of titanium halide and organic titanate react to form a titanium alkoxyhalide, Ti(OR)aXb, where OR and X are alkoxide and halide, respectively and a+b is the valence of titanium, which is typically 4. In the alternative, the first halogenation/titanation agent may be a single compound. Examples of a first halogenation/titanation agent are Ti(OC2H5)3Cl, Ti(OC2H 5)2Cl2, Ti(OC3H7)2Cl2, Ti(OC3H7)3Cl, Ti(OC4H9)Cl3, Ti(OC6H13)2Cl2, Ti(OC2H5)2Br2, and Ti(OC12 H5)Cl3. The first halogenation/titanation step is generally carried out by first slurrying the halogenation product "A" in a hydrocarbon solvent at room temperature/ambient temperature. Nonlimiting examples of suitable hydrocarbons solvent include heptane, hexane, toluene, octane. The product "A" can be at least partially soluble in the hydrocarbon solvent. A solid product "B" is precipitated at room temperature following the addition of the halogenation/titanation agent to the soluble product "A". The amount of halogenation/titanation agent utilized must be sufficient to precipitate a solid product from the solution. In general, the amount of halogenation/titanation agent utilized, based on the ratio of titanium to metal, will generally be in the range of 0.5 to 5, typically in the range of 1 to 4, and can be in the range 1.5 to 2.5. The solid product "B" precipitated in this first halogenation/titanation step is then recovered by any suitable recovery technique, and then washed at room/ambient temperature with a solvent, such as hexane. Generally, the solid product "B" is washed until the [Ti] is less than about 100 mmol/l. Within the present invention [Ti] represents any titanium species capable of acting as a second generation Ziegler catalyst, which would comprise titanium species that are not part of the reaction products as described herein. The resulting product "B" is then subjected to a second and third halogenating/titanating steps to produce products "C" and "D". After each halogenating/titanating step the solid product can be washed until the [Ti] is less than a desired amount. For example, less than about 100 mmol/l, less than about 50 mmol/l, or less than about 10 mmol/l. After the final halogenating/titanating step, the product can be washed until the [Ti] is less than a desired amount, for example, less than about 20 mmol/l, less than about 10 mmol/l, or less than about 1.0 mmol/L. It is believed that a lower [Ti] can produce improved catalyst results by reducing the amount of titanium that can act as a second generation Ziegler species. It is believed that a that a lower [Ti] can be a factor in producing improved catalyst results such as a narrower MWD. The second halogenation/titanation step is generally carried out by slurrying the solid product recovered from the first titanation step, solid product "B", in a hydrocarbon solvent. Hydrocarbon solvents listed as suitable for the first halogenation/titanation step may be utilized. The second and third halogenation/titanation steps can utilize a different compound or combination of compounds from the first halogenation/titanation step. The second and third halogenation/titanation steps can utilize the same agent at a concentration that is stronger than that used in the first halogenation/titanation agent, but this is not a necessity. The second and third halogenating/titanating agents can be a titanium halide, such as titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4). The halogenation/titanation agent is added to the slurry. The addition can be carried out at ambient/room temperature, but can also be carried out at temperatures and pressures other than ambient. Generally, the second and third halogenation/titanation agents comprise titanium tetrachloride. Typically the second and third halogenation/titanation steps each comprise a titanium to magnesium ratio in a range of 0.1 to 5, a ratio of about 2.0 can also be used, and a ratio of about 1.0 can be used. The third halogenation/titanation step is generally carried out at room temperature and in a slurry, but can also be carried out at temperatures and pressures other than ambient. The amount of titanium tetrachloride utilized, or alternate halogenation/titanation agent, may also be expressed in terms of equivalents, an equivalent herein is amount of titanium relative to the magnesium or metal compound. The amount of titanium of each of the second and third halogenating/titanating steps will generally be in the range of 0.1 to 5.0 equivalents, can be in the range of 0.25 to 4 equivalents, typically is in the range of 0.3 to 3 equivalents, and it can be desirable to be in the range of 0.4 to 2.0 equivalents. In one particular embodiment, the amount of titanium tetrachloride utilized in each of the second and third halogenation/titanation steps is in the range of 0.45 to 1.5 equivalent. The catalyst component "D" made by the above described process may be combined with an organometallic catalyst component (a "preactivating agent") to form a preactivated catalyst system suitable for the polymerization of olefins. Typically, the preactivating agents which are used together with the transition metal containing catalyst component "D" are organometallic compounds such as aluminum alkyls, aluminum alkyl hydrides, lithium aluminum alkyls, zinc alkyls, magnesium alkyls. Preferably, the preactivating agent is selected from the group consisting of trialkylaluminums, dialkylaluminum halides, and alkylaluminum dihalides. The preactivating agent is preferably an organoaluminum compound. The organoaluminum preactivating agent is typically an aluminum alkyl of the formula AlR3 wherein at least one R is an alkyl having 1-8 carbon atoms or a halide, and wherein each of the R may be the same or different. Suitable preactivating agents include trialkyl aluminum such as, for example, trimethyl aluminum (TMA), triethylaluminum (TEAL), triisobutylaluminum (TIBAL) and also include diethylaluminum chloride, triisobutylaluminum chloride, butylaluminum dichloride, and mixtures thereof. The organoaluminum preactivating agent is more preferably trimethyl aluminum (TMA), triethyl aluminum (TEAL), triisobutyl aluminum (TIBAL) or mixtures thereof. Preferably, the preactivating agent is TEAL, since with TEAL the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of the bimodal polyethylene prepared in the two reactors in series is even wider than when using other organoaluminum preactivating agents. Generally, when using TEAL as the preactivating agent the MWD will be at least 4. In general, the ratio of Al to titanium can be in the range from 0.1:1 to 2:1 and typically is 0. 25:1 to 1.2:1. Optionally, the Ziegler-Natta catalyst may be pre-polymerized. Generally, a pre-polymerization process is affected by contacting a small amount of monomer with the catalyst after the catalyst has been contacted with the preactivating agent. A pre-polymerization process is described in U.S 5,106,804; US 5,153,158; and US 5,594,071. Optionally, an electron donor may be added with the halogenation agent, the first halogenation/titanation agent, or the subsequent halogenation/titanation agent or agents. It may be desirable to have an electron donor utilized in the second halogenation/titanation step. Electron donors for use in the preparation of polyolefin catalysts are well known, and any suitable electron donor may be utilized in the present invention that will provide a suitable catalyst. Electron donors, also known as Lewis bases, are organic compounds of oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous, or sulfur which can donate an electron pair to the catalyst. The electron donor may be a monofunctional or polyfunctional compound, can be selected from among the aliphatic or aromatic carboxylic acids and their alkyl esters, the aliphatic or cyclic ethers, ketones, vinyl esters, acryl derivatives, particularly alkyl acrylates or methacrylates and silanes. An example of a suitable electron donor is di-n-butyl phthalate. A generic example of a suitable electron donor is an alkylsilylalkoxide of the general formula RSi(OR')3, e.g., methylsilyltriethoxide [MeSi(OEt3)], where R and R' are alkyls with 1-5 carbon atoms and may be the same or different. For the polymerization process, an internal electron donor can be used in the synthesis of the catalyst and an external electron donor or stereoselectivity control agent (SCA) to activate the catalyst at polymerization. An internal electron donor may be used in the formation reaction of the catalyst during the halogenation or halogenation/titanation steps. Compounds suitable as internal electron donors for preparing conventional supported Ziegler-Natta catalyst components include ethers, diethers, ketones, lactones, electron donors compounds with N, P and/or S atoms and specific classes of esters. Particularly suitable are the esters of phthalic acid, such as diisobutyl, dioctyl, diphenyl and benzylbutylphthalate; esters of malonic acid, such as diisobutyl and diethylmalonate; alkyl and arylpivalates; alkyl, cycloalkyl and arylmaleates; alkyl and aryl carbonates such as diisobutyl; ethyl-phenyl and diphenylcarbonate; succinic acid esters, such as mono and diethyl succinate. External donors which may be utilized in the preparation of a catalyst according to the present invention include organosilane compounds such as alkoxysilanes of general formula SiRm(OR')4-m, where R is selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group, an aryl group and a vinyl group; R' is an alkyl group; and m is 0-3, wherein R may be identical with R'; when m is 0, 1 or 2, the R' groups may be identical or different; and when m is 2 or 3, the R groups may be identical or different. The external donor of the present invention can be selected from a silane compound of the following formula: wherein R1 and R4 are both an alkyl or cycloalkyl group containing a primary, secondary or tertiary carbon atom attached to the silicon, R1 and R4 being the same or different; R2 and R3 are alkyl or aryl groups. R1 may be methyl, isopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl or t-butyl; R2 and R3 may be methyl, ethyl, propyl, or butyl groups and not necessarily the same; and R4 may also methyl, isopropyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl or t-butyl. Specific external donors are cyclohexylmethyldimethoxy silane (CMDS), diisopropyldimethoxysilane (DIDS) cyclohexylisopropyl dimethoxysilane (CIDS), dicyclopentyldimethoxysilane (CPDS) or di-t-butyl dimethoxysilane (DTDS). The polyethylene composition used herein may alternatively be obtained either (i) by producing the first and the second polyethylene fraction separately from one another and then physically blending them, for example in an extruder or blender or mixer; or (ii) by successively producing the first and second polyethylene fraction in at least two serially connected polymerization reactors. Preferably, the first and second polyethylene fractions are successively produced in at least two serially connected polymerization reactors. More preferably, the first and second polyethylene fractions are successively produced in at least two serially connected loop reactors, even more preferably in at least two slurry loop reactors, and most preferably in at least two liquid full loop reactors. Polymerization catalyst may be added to any of the at least two polymerization reactors, provided that it is added at least to the first polymerization reactor of the series. The polymerization catalyst added to different polymerization reactors may be the same or may be different. It is, however, preferred that the polymerization catalyst is the same and is only added to the first polymerization reactor of the series. If such is the case, it is preferred that the polymerization takes place in presence of the combined polyethylene fractions produced in the previous polymerization reactors, i.e. that the combined polyethylene fractions are transferred to the successive polymerization reactor. The sequence, in which the first and second polyethylene fraction are produced, is not particularly important. It is, however, preferred that the first polyethylene fraction is produced in the first polymerization reactor and that the second polyethylene fraction is produced in the second polymerization reactor. The respective molecular weight of the polyethylene fractions produced in each polymerization reactor may be controlled by known techniques, such as for example by choice of polymerization catalyst and temperature or by using hydrogen in different concentrations. In a preferred arrangement, the product of a first reactor, including the olefin monomer, is contacted with the second co-reactant and the catalyst system in a second reactor to produce and mix the second polyolefin with the first polyolefin in the second reactor. This is also known as a chemical blend. The first and second reactors are conveniently interconnected, i.e. serially connected, reactors such as interconnected loop reactors. It is also possible to introduce into the second reactor fresh olefin monomer as well as the product of the first reactor. Because the second polyolefin is produced in the presence of the first polyolefin a multimodal or at least bimodal molecular weight distribution is obtained. In one embodiment of the invention, the first co-reactant in the first reactor is hydrogen, to produce the first polyethylene fraction and the second co-reactant in the second reactor is the comonomer to produce the second polyethylene fraction. In an alternative embodiment, the first co-reactant in the first reactor is the comonomer. Homopolymerization then takes place in the second reactor with little or no interference from the comonomer. Preferably, unreacted comonomer is removed before the polyethylene fraction from the first polymerization reactor is transferred to the second polymerization reactor. The temperature in each polymerization reactor may be in the range of from 20°C to 120°C, preferably from 60°C to 110°C, and most preferably from 78°C to 98°C. The polyethylene composition disclosed herein may further comprise one or more thermoplastic polymers different from above first and second polyethylene fraction. Preferred suitable thermoplastic polymers are for example propylene homopolymers, copolymers of propylene and at least one comonomer, ethylene homopolymers, copolymers of ethylene and at least one comonomer, wherein said at least one comonomer is defined as stated above. Caps and closures may be produced by injection molding or by compression molding, of which Injection molding is preferred. In a general form injection molding comprises the steps of (i) melting the polyethylene composition to obtain a molten polyethylene composition;(ii) injecting the molten polyethylene composition of step (i) into a mold, with said mold being an injection mold or a compression mold,(iii) cooling the mold to solidify the polyethylene composition; and(iv) recovering the injection-molded or compression-molded cap or closure. Injection-molding as used herein is performed using methods and equipment well known to the person skilled in the art. The present polyethylene composition is injected into the mold at a melt temperature in the range from 160°C to 280°C, preferably in the range from 180°C to 260°C. An overview of injection molding and compression molding is for example given in Injection Molding Handbook, D.V. Rosato et al., 3rd edition, 2000, Kluwer Academic Publishers. The molds used in the production of the present caps and closures may be any mold usually used in the production of caps and closures, such as for example multi-cavity molds wherein a number of caps and closures is produced simultaneously. The caps and closures of the present application are not especially limited. They may include screw-caps, caps and closures with a living hinge, glossy caps and closures, transparent caps and closures. The caps and closures of the present application may be used in various packaging applications, such as for example food packaging, detergent packaging, cosmetic packaging, paint packaging or medical packaging. Examples in food packaging are caps and closures on tubes, bottles, such as for juices, water or milk products. Examples in detergent packaging are caps and closures for washing powders, dish soap, household cleaners. Examples in cosmetic packaging are shower gels, shampoos, oils, cremes, liquid soaps. Examples in medical packaging are packaging for pills, solutions, disinfectants. Hence, the present application also provides for a packaging comprising the above defined caps and closures. Test methods Melt index MI2 is determined according to ISO 1133, condition D, at 190°C and 2.16 kg. Melt index HLMI ("High load melt index") is determined according to ISO 1133, condition G, at 190°C and 21.6 kg. Melt index HL275 is determined in the same way as the HLMI, except that the die opening has a diameter 2.75 mm, thus allowing increased accuracy for highly viscous polyethylene compositions. HL275 can be converted to HLMI using the following equation HLMI=HL⁢275/3.2 Density is determined according to ISO 1183 at 23°C. Tensile modulus was determined at 23°C in accordance with ISO 527 using specimen 1 B. Environmental stress crack resistance (ESCR) is determined by means of a full notch creep test (FNCT) in accordance with ISO 16770 using specimen C, at a temperature of 50°C with a strain of 6 MPa using 2 % sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, available for example as Maranil A55 (CAS nr. 68411-30-3). Taste was analyzed on pellets of the polyethylene composition based on the comparison of a sample and a reference. For the sample 25 g of pellets were put into 1 l of Evian water (in glass bottle). 1 l of Evian water (in glass bottle) served as the reference. Both, sample and reference, were stored in glass containers with a glass closure at 60°C for 48 h and then at 20°C for 48 h. Subsequently they were diluted with Evian water (in glass bottle) as shown in Table 1. Table 1DilutionEvain waterSample resp. Reference[volume part][volume part]A211A321A541A761 These dilutions were then tested according to NF V 09-013 (based on ISO 4120:2004) by 10 qualified and specialized testers in a testing laboratory complying with NF V 09-105 (based on ISO 8589:2007). A sample is considered as having failed if there is a significant difference between reference dilution and sample dilution at level A5 or A7.
