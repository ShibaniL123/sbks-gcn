Electrolyte for Anodization and Anodized Surface The present invention is concerned with the electrochemical formation of metal oxide films via anodization. It has been found that electrolytes containing a high concentration of an oxoacid of phosphorus provide a versatile and effective too! for the anodization of metal substrates, and allow for the production of stable oxide films, well adhering to the metal substrates. The so-called valve metals (i.e. , metals like aluminum, tantalum, niobium, titanium, tungsten, etc.) typically become coated with a film of uniform thickness when positively biased in an appropriate electrolyte. Indeed, valve metals undergo the formation of an adherent, electrically insulating or semiconducting, anodic oxide layer when anodized in suitable electrolytic solutions. At constant temperature, the film thickness and the rate of film growth are directly proportional to the applied voltage and current density, respectively. These properties have been extensively described in "Anodic Oxide Films" by L. Young, 1 961 , Academic Press. London These findings have been exploited in depth for over a century by manufacturers of electrolytic capacitors in order to obtain anodic films. In fact, in such a field, electrochemical anodization was shown to be the most suitable approach for producing capacitors, allowing a simple and effective control of oxide films thickness, according to finished device voltage and capacitance requirements. Other well-known and developed applications for anodic films include production of rectifiers, lightning arrestors and devices in which the anodic film takes the place of traditional electrical insulation, such as special transformers, motors, relays, etc. Anodization of aluminum substrates is a standard process in aluminum coloring, sealing, and to establish corrosion protection. In addition, because of the typical uniformity obtained with anodization, anodic films may be further used in the production of surgical implants where high passivity, a minimum of induced currents and optimal biocompatibility are all desirable. The rapid rate of growth achieved with suitable anodizing electrolyte also allows the production of practical anti-seize coatings for connectors and plumbing fabricated from valve metals and alloys. Basically, aluminum and aluminum alloys are anodized to increase corrosion resistance, to enhance surface hardness, to provide a colored surface and to achieve improved lubrication or adhesion properties (see standard ASTM D3933 - 98(2010) Standard Guide for Preparation of Aluminum Surfaces for Structural Adhesives Bonding (Phosphoric Acid Anodizing), or Redux Bonding Technology - HEXCEL, Rev. July 2003, Publication No. RGU 034c). Aluminum aircraft parts, architectural materials and consumer products are commonly processed through anodization. Anodized aluminum can be found in several daily-use goods, such as mp3 players, multi-tools, flashlights, cookware, cameras, sporting goods, window frames and roofs. The main reason for such a broad applicability lies in the alumina morphological and physicochemical features achievable by means of anodization. which mainly consist on the formation of a porous and insulating film, well sticking on the substrate. An anodic film characterized by deep pores can actually retain lubricants or dyes much better than a smooth surface would. Moreover, anodic nanoporous alumina has been widely studied on bulk aluminum substrates to develop various functional nanostructures. such as long-range ordered membranes (see H. Masuda et al.. Ordered metal nanohole arrays made by a two-step replication of honeycomb structures of anodic alumina. Science 268 (1995) 1466-1468. and W. Lee, Fast fabrication of long-range ordered porous alumina membranes by hard anodization, Nature Materials, 5 (2006) 741 -747), which were further used as a host template for deposition of a wide variety of materials (see C.R. Martin, Nanomaterials: A membrane-based synthetic approach, Science, 266 (1994) 1961 -1965). Aside from aluminum, another metal commonly used to produce oxide films is titanium (along with its alloys). Generally, titania is a semiconductor exhibiting excellent features such as enhanced chemical stability, good resistivity to corrosion (and photocorrosion), biocompatibility, strong UV light absorption and improved adsorption properties. For these reasons, titania has been widely employed for pigments, paints, cosmetic products, ultraviolet shielding agents, catalysts, catalyst supports, photocatalyst (to convert solar-into- chemical energy), light harvesting devices (such as solar cells, capable to convert solar energy into electricity), gas-sensors, implants and various electronics components Recently, considerable attention has been paid to the photocatalytic activity and amphipathic properties of titania, which are exhibited when titania absorbs UV light. It has been confirmed that titania is largely effective in self-cleaning and in decomposing hazardous organic substances, degrading air pollutants and sterilizing (see P. Roy et a/. , Ti02 nanotubes: synthesis and applications, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 50 (201 1 ) 2904, J. Park et al. , Nanosize and vitality: Ti02 nanotube diameter directs cell fate, Nano Letters 7 (2007) 1686-1691 , C. Von Wilmowsky et al., In Vivo Evaluation of Anodic Ti02 Nanotubes: An Experimental Study in the Pig, Journal of Biomedical Materials Research - Part B Applied Biomaterials 89 (2009) 165-171 ). One of the conventional ways to improve titania properties consists of increasing the specific surface area. Thus, many attempts have been made in the last decades, for example by forming titania into nano-scale fine particles, flakes, wires, tubes or porous bodies (e.g., Kasuga et al. , United States Patent No. 6,027,775). The fabrication of metal surfaces modified by titania nanotubes could be accomplished using fluoride containing aqueous electrolytes (e.g., Paulose et al. , WO 2009/015329 A2; P. Roy et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 50 (201 1) 2904). Titania, particularly in shape of a solid matrix with channels or tubes, or as a porous body such as honeycomb structure, exhibits high surface area, given indeed by a dramatically increased aspect ratio. This basically improves titania features for all the applications that require a high surface area. Most of the oxides prepared via anodization are grown in a water-based electrolyte, e.g. , diluted acids and/or salts. In fact, in accordance with the ASTM standard D3933-98 (2010), the prototype electrolyte for phosphate-based anodizing of aluminum surfaces is an aqueous solution containing 9 to 12 wt.% of phosphoric acid. As an alternative to such aqueous solutions, electrolytes based on organic solvents (such as ethylene glycol, glycerol or dimethyl sulphoxide) have attracted in the past decades wide interest for the growth of porous structures on valve metals by forming anodic porous films on the metal substrate when the latter is positively biased in a proper electrolyte. Melody et al. (see United States Patent No. 5.185,075: No. 5.716.51 1 : No. 5.935,408: No. 6.162.345: No. 6.183,618: No. 6.235.181 : No. 6,267.861 ; No. 6.409,905: No. 6,436 268: No. 6,652,729; No. 6.744.621 ; No. 6.755,959; No. 6,788.523: No. 6.808.615; and UK Patent No. GB 2,168,383) described the preparation of anodic layers (in particular the formation of the so-called NTL films, i.e. , non- thickness-limited films) by anodizing valve metals in an organic media containing phosphorus species. Also other authors (see for example United States Patent No. 5.21 1 ,832 by M. Cooper and No. 4.131 .520 by W.J. Bernard) reported on the use of phosphoric acid in organic solutions to form anodic films on different valve metals and their alloys. In the context of the present invention, it was found that the use of an electrolyte containing an oxoacid of phosphorus at a high concentration represents a convenient and economic strategy for the anodization of valve metal substrates. The versatility of the resulting anodization process allows the properties of the formed metal oxide layers to be effectively controlled. In particular, such electrolytes facilitate the formation of stable, well adhering porous oxide films with a high surface area on a wide variety of metal substrates. These films can be obtained in the absence of fluorine containing compounds in the electrolyte, such as fluoride salts, therefore reducing the toxicity risks associated with the anodization process. The absence of fluorine containing species allows for an easy scale-up of the process, and thus for the anodization of extended surface areas. Moreover, it has been found that anodization in such an electrolyte can be carried out at a relatively low current density, leading to a reduced power consumption. Metal oxide films can be provided by using the process in accordance with the invention that exhibit advanced properties, e.g., in terms of their mechanical and chemical stability, in terms of the absence of impurities such as fluoride ions and, nevertheless, in terms of their adherence to the metal substrate. Thus, the invention provides, in accordance with a first aspect, a process for the electrochemical formation of a metal oxide film on the surface of a metal substrate comprising a valve metal, said process comprising the step of anodizing the metal substrate in an electrolyte, characterized in that the electrolyte comprises at least 85% by weight of an oxoacid of phosphorus, based on the total weight of the electrolyte. In accordance with a further aspect, the invention provides a metal substrate comprising a valve metal selected from W, Ti, Ta, Nb. Hf, Zr, V, Fe, Mg; Zn, Sn, Co and Ga. which metal substrate carries on a surface thereof a metal oxide film obtainable from the process in accordance with the invention, which is further characterized in that the metal oxide film is provided by a metal oxide matrix comprising a plurality of channels which extend from the surface of the metal substrate towards the surface of the oxide film facing away from the surface of the metal substrate, and which have an opening at the end facing towards the surface of the oxide film such that a plurality of open pores is present at the surface of the metal oxide film. The metal substrate for use in the process of the invention comprises a valve metal. Typical and preferred examples of valve metals suitable for the use in the context of the invention can be selected from Al. W, Ti, Ta, Nb, Hf, Zr. V, Fe, Mg. Zn, Sn, Co and Ga. More preferred as a valve metal is a metal selected from Al, W, Ti. Ta, Nb, Hf and Zr. Further preferred is a metal selected from Al, W, Ti, and Nb, and particularly preferred as a valve metal is a metal selected from Al. W and Ti. The metal substrate may comprise a single metal, or may comprise two or more metals, in particular in the form of an alloy. If the metal substrate comprises a single metal, this metal is a valve metal, e.g., as listed above. If the metal substrate comprises two or more metals, in particular in the form of an alloy, at least one of the metals, preferably all of the metals is/are a valve metal. If the metal substrate is formed from two or more metals, in particular in the form of an alloy, it is preferred that more than 50% by weight, based on the total weight of the metal substrate, is provided by one or more valve metals. More preferably, more than 70% by weight, and in particular more than 90% by weight of the metal substrate are provided by one or more valve metals, it is particularly preferred that the metal substrate consists of one or more valve metals, e.g. , the exemplary or preferred valve metals listed above, in particular of one or more valve metals selected from Al, W, Ti and Nb. Most preferably, the metal substrate is formed from one of Al, W, Ti or Nb. The form of the metal substrate for use In accordance with the Invention is not particularly limited. Examples are sheet forms, including metal foils, but solid or hollow three dimensional bodies may also be anodized. The metal substrate comprising a valve metal for use in the context of the invention may be combined with another material, e.g., to form a composite article. Such other materials may be metals, but also organic materials, such as organic polymers. As will be understood by the skilled reader, if the metal substrate is combined with another material, the combination should be such that the surface of the metal substrate remains accessible to the electrolyte. In accordance with the process of the invention, the metal substrate is anodized in an electrolyte comprising at least 85% by weight of an oxoacid of phosphorus, based on the total weight of the electrolyte. Preferably, the content of the oxoacid of phosphorus is at least 90% by weight, more preferably at least 95% by weight and particularly at least 97% by weight, or even at least 99% by weight. In accordance with the invention, electrolytes consisting of an oxoacid of phosphorus may also be used. Unless an electrolyte is used which consists of an oxoacid of phosphorus, it may further contain water and/or an organic solvent. Typical examples of a solvent are ethylene glycol, glycerol or DMSO. However, it is preferred that the amount of any organic solvent in the electrolyte does not exceed 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the electrolyte. It is further preferred that an amount of 2 % by weight is not exceeded, and it is more preferred that the organic solvent is absent. It is preferred that the electrolyte contains at least trace amounts of water, e.g., 10 ppmw or more, preferably 15 ppmw or more, and in particular 25 ppmw or more, and 500 ppmw or less (wherein "ppmw" refers to parts per million on a weight/weight basis). In order to provide such trace amounts, it is generally not necessary to add water to the electrolyte, since such amounts can be achieved via uptake of humidity by the electrolyte from the atmosphere. The upper limit of the water content is defined by the general and preferred amounts of the oxoacid of phosphorus discussed above. Thus, the maximum water content in the electrolyte in accordance with the invention is 15% by weight, preferred is a water content of 10% by weight or less, further preferred Is a water content of 5% by weight or less, and particularly preferred is a water content of 3% by weight or less and most preferred is a water content of 1 % by weight or less. If water is added to the electrolyte, preferably deionized water is used. As for ions contained in the electrolyte, preferably the content of haiide ions is below 0.1 % by weight, more preferably below 0.01 % by weight, and in particular below 0.001 % by weight based on the total weight of the electrolyte. It is further preferred that the content of any ions other than those formed by dissociation of the oxoacid of phosphorus in the electrolyte is generally below 0.1 % by weight, more preferably below 0.01 % by weight, and in particular below 0.001 % by weight. Furthermore, it is preferred that no compounds containing fluoride ions are added to the electrolyte. More preferably, no compounds containing haiide ions (including the corresponding acids, such as HCI or HF) are added to the electrolyte. Still more preferably, no compounds containing haiide ions (including the corresponding acids, such as HCI or HF), no compounds containing sulfate ions (including H2SQ4), no compounds containing sulfite ions (including H2S03), no compounds containing nitrate ions (including HN03). no chromic acid and no organic acids such as oxalic acid, glycolic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid and malic acid are added to the electrolyte. Most preferably, no additional salts, acids or bases are added to the electrolyte apart from the oxoacid of phosphorus. Thus, in accordance with a preferred embodiment, the electrolyte consists of 85 to 100% by weight of an oxoacid of phosphorus and 0%, or trace amounts, to 15% by weight of water such that the two components add up to 100% as the total weight of the electrolyte. More preferred is an electrolyte consisting of 90 to 100% by weight of an oxoacid of phosphorus and 0%, or trace amounts, to 10% by weight of water. Yet further preferred is an electrolyte consisting of 95 to 100% by weight of an oxoacid of phosphorus and 0%, or trace amounts, to 5% by weight of water, particularly preferred is an electrolyte consisting of 97 to 100% by weight of an oxoacid of phosphorus and 0%, or trace amounts, to 3% by weight of water, and most preferred is an electrolyte consisting of 99 to 100% by weight of an oxoacid of phosphorus and 0%, or trace amounts, to 1 % by weight of water, such that the two components add up to 100%. Also in this context, the presence of at least trace amounts of water, e.g., 10 ppmw or more, preferably 15 ppmw or more, and in particular 25 ppmw or more, in the electrolyte is preferable. The electrolyte for the use in the context of the invention is generally liquid at the temperature at which the anodization is carried out, such that the metal substrate subjected to anodization can be conveniently immersed into the electrolyte. Typically, the anodization temperature is a temperature within the range of 0 to 200°C, such that It is possible to use melts of oxoacids of phosphorus which are solid at room temperature but liquid at a higher temperature (such as pure orthophosphoric acid with a melting point around 42 °C, or pure pyrophosphoric acid with a melting point around 72 °C). It is also possible to carry out the anodization in super-cooled melts of oxoacids of phosphorus at temperatures below their melting point. In the electrolyte, a single oxoacid of phosphorus or a combination of two or more oxoacids of phosphorus may be contained. It will be understood that the above general and preferred concentrations given for the oxoacid of phosphorus apply likewise for such combinations. In this case, the amount is the total amount of the oxoacids of phosphorus contained in the electrolyte The oxoacid of phosphorus is an inorganic acid, such that no carbon atoms are contained in the oxoacid. Typical representatives of oxoacids of phosphorus are ortho-acids having the formula H3POn, with n being 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6; meta-acids with the formula [HPOR.- r.,, with n being 3 or 4 and m being 3. 4 or 6; diacids with the formula Η4Ρ2Οη, with n being 4, 5, 6. 7 or 8, or polyacids with the formula Hm+2Pm03m+i , with m being 3 or more, e.g., 3 to 20. More preferably, the electrolyte according to the invention contains an oxoacid of phosphorus selected from orthophosphoric acid (H3P04), diphosphoric or pyrophosphoric acid (H4P207), polyphosphoric acid (Hm*2 m03m+i, with m being 3 or more. e.g.. 3 to 20) or combinations of two or more of these. With a view to a convenient availability, particularly preferred are orthophosphoric (H3P04), diphosphoric and pyrophosphoric (H4P207) acids, singly or in combination. In line with common practice in the art. the reference to an oxoacid with a specific chemical composition, such as orthophosphoric acid or pyrophosphoric acid, encompasses the equilibrium mixture of this oxoacid with chemical species which may be formed via elimination of one or more water molecules from an oxoacid molecule controlled by the water content of the electrolyte which is limited to 15% by weight or less. For example, elimination of a water molecule per two molecules of orthophosphoric acid may lead to the formation of pyrophosphoric acid H4P207, and the elimination of one water molecule per one molecule of orthophosphoric acid may lead to metaphosphoric acid (HP03). In accordance with a particularly preferred embodiment, the invention provides a process for the electrochemical formation of a metal oxide film on a surface of a metal substrate comprising a valve metal selected from Al, Ti, W and Nb, said process comprising the step of anodizing the metal substrate in an electrolyte comprising 90 to 100% by weight of an oxoacid of phosphorus selected from H3P04 and H4P207, and 0 to 10% by weight of water, in particular 95 to 100% by weight of an oxoacid of phosphorus selected from H3P04 and H4P207, and 0 to 5% by weight of water, more preferably 97 to 100% by weight of an oxoacid of phosphorus selected from H3P04 and H4P207, and 0 to 3% by weight of water, and most preferably 99 to 100% by weight of an oxoacid of phosphorus selected from H3P0 and H4P207, and 0 to 1 % by weight of water, with the percentages being based on the total weight of the electrolyte. Also for these embodiments, it is particularly preferred that the contents of the oxoacid of phosphorus and the content of water add up to 100 % and that at least trace amounts of water, e.g., as defined above, are present in the electrolyte. The electrolyte can be conveniently prepared by mixing any components that are to be included therein, if necessary in the form of a melt. If a low water content in the electrolyte is desired, it may be useful to heat the electrolyte, in advance of the anodization step, up to a temperature of 100 °C or higher, e.g. , to a temperature in the range of 100 - 160 °C. The anodization can be conveniently carried out by immersing the metal substrate in the electrolyte. It will be understood that the term "electrolyte" as used herein refers, in line with the general use in the art, to the entire liquid phase into which the metal substrate is immersed for the anodization process. If necessary, the temperature of the electrolyte can be increased above room temperature (23 °C) to provide the electrolyte in liquid form. As established for conventional anodization processes, it may be desirable to polish the surface of the metal substrate before the anodization is carried out, e.g., by mechanical and/or chemical means. Moreover, it is preferable to clean the surface of the metal substrate prior to its contact with the electrolyte, e.g.. by using specific organic solvents, deionized water, ultrasound treatment or other conventional methods. As will be understood by the skilled reader, anodization is carried out by applying a positive potential to the metal substrate that is immersed in the electrolyte. Thus, the metal substrate is positively biased and represents the working electrode or anode in the anodization process. The counter electrode, which is also immersed in the electrolyte, is made of an inert material, typically a noble metal such as platinum. Frequently, a gauze or mesh made of the inert material is used as the counter electrode in the anodization process. By using such a configuration, an electrical current is allowed to flow through the electrolyte from one electrode to the other such that the growth of metal oxide film is achieved on the surface of the metal substrate in contact with the electrolyte. The anodization is typically carried out at temperatures between 0 and 150 °C (measured in the electrolyte), preferably 15 to 140 °C. The applied potential typically ranges from 0.5 to 60 V. The anodization of metal substrates is generally carried out while the applied potential Is kept constant (potentiostatic anodization) or while the current density is controlled at a constant level (galvanostatic anodization). Both approaches are suitable for the process of the present invention. Favourably, the process of the present invention allows porous metal oxide films with high surface area and homogeneous pore structure to be fabricated at very low current densities. For example, for a given metal substrate, the temperature and the voltage can be adjusted via routine tests until a suitable current density is reached for the formation of a porous metal oxide film. Too high current densities, e.g. , in the range of tens of mA cm 2 or higher, most likely lead to an extensive electrochemical etching at the anode, rather than to the formation of a porous and nanostructured film. It is possible to apply conditions (e.g. , potential, temperature) such that the measured current density reaches a steady state value during the anodization process, e.g. , after 5 minutes, preferably 3 minutes and more preferably 2 minutes from the start of the current flow. The duration of the anodization process can be selected with a view on the desired thickness of the film. Anodization times can thus be as short as several seconds, and can also be extended to several hours. Generally, it is convenient to carry out the anodization over a period of time ranging from 30 s to 3 h, preferably 1 min to 2 hours, and particularly 2 min to 1 hour. The following parameters have been found to be particularly advantageous for substrates containing preferred valve metals. For example, for the formation of a film comprising or consisting of aluminum oxide on a metal substrate comprising or consisting of Al, it is preferable that the content of the oxoacid of phosphorus in the electrolyte ranges from 97 to 100% by weight, in particular from 99 to 100% by weight, and the water content preferably ranges from 0 to 3 % by weight, in particular from 0 to 1 % by weight. Most preferably, the electrolyte consists of the oxoacid of phosphorus containing 10 to 500 ppmw of water. The preferred anodization temperature ranges from 0 to 40°C, in particular 15 to 30 °C. Thus, for the formation of a film comprising or consisting of aluminum oxide on a metal substrate comprising or consisting of Al, if is also preferable to carry out the anodization in a super-cooled melt of an oxoacid of phosphorus at temperatures below its melting point. The preferred potential to be applied during anodization ranges from 1 to 60 V, in particular 1 to 40 V. Furthermore, It is of great advantage for the formation of a homogeneous, porous aluminum oxide film that the current density during the formation of the film can be adjusted, e.g., by the process parameters mentioned above, to a value within the range of 0.1 - 0.5 mA cm 3 For the formation of a film comprising or consisting of titanium oxide on a metal substrate comprising or consisting of Ti. it Is preferable if the content of the oxoacid of phosphorus in the electrolyte ranges from 90 to 100% by weight, more preferably from 95 to 100% by weight and in particular from 99 to 100% by weight, and the water content preferably ranges from 0 to 10%) by weight, more preferably 0 to 5% by weight and in particular from 0 to 1 % by weight. Most preferably, at least a trace amount of water is present. The preferred anodization temperature ranges from 20 to 150 °C, in particular 20 to 140 °C. The preferred potential to be applied during anodization ranges from 0.5 to 60 V. Furthermore, it is of great advantage for the formation of a homogeneous, porous titanium oxide film that the current density during the formation of the film can be adjusted, e.g. , by the process parameters mentioned above, to a value within the range of 1 to 50 μΑ cm'2, preferably 1 to 20 LIA cm"2, and more preferably 2 to 9 μΑ cm 2. For the formation of a film comprising or consisting of niobium oxide on a metal substrate comprising or consisting of Nb. it is preferable if the content of the oxoacid of phosphorus in the electrolyte ranges from 90 to 100% by weight, more preferably from 95 to 100% by weight and in particular from 99 to 100% by weight, and the water content preferably ranges from 0 to 10%! by weight, more preferably 0 to 5% by weight and in particular from 0 to 1 % by weight. Most preferably, at least a trace amount of water is present. The preferred anodization temperature ranges from 60 to 140 °C, in particular 60 to 120 °C. The preferred potential to be applied during anodization ranges from 1 to 20 V. Furthermore, it is of great advantage for the formation of a homogeneous, porous niobium oxide film that the current density during the formation of the film can be adjusted, e.g. , by the process parameters mentioned above, to a value within the range of 0.1 - 0.5 mA cm"2. For the formation of a film comprising or consisting of tungsten oxide on a metal substrate comprising or consisting of W, it is preferable if the content of the oxoacid of phosphorus in the electroiyte ranges from 90 to 100% by weight, more preferably from 95 to 100% by weight and in particular from 99 to 100% by weight, and the water content preferably ranges from 0 to 10% by weight, more preferably 0 to 5% by weight and in particular from 0 to 1 % by weight. Most preferably, at least a trace amount of water is present. The preferred anodization temperature ranges from 60 to 140 °C, In particular 60 to 120 °C. The preferred potential to be applied during anodization ranges from 1 to 20 V, and in particular from 5 to 10 V. Furthermore, it is of great advantage for the formation of a homogeneous, porous tungsten oxide film that the current density during the formation of the film can be adjusted, e.g. , by the process parameters mentioned above, to a value within the range of 0.1 - 0.5 mA cm"2. After the anodization step, the metal substrate carrying a metal oxide film can be withdrawn from the electrolyte. Typically, it is subsequently washed to remove the remaining electrolyte, e.g., with deionized water. The process of the invention thus provides a metal substrate comprising a valve metal which carries on a surface thereof a film of an oxide of the valve metal comprised by the metal substrate. The metal oxide film can be prepared in different thicknesses, depending on the duration of the anodization step. Typically, the thickness of the film is very homogeneous, it generally ranges from 100 nm to several pm. Preferably, the film has a thickness of 100 nm or more, more preferably 200 nm or more and in particular 500 nm or more. The maximum thickness is mainly limited by practical constraints arising from the limited conductivity of the oxide film in the anodization process. For example, metal oxide films with a thickness of up to 3 or 5 pm can be conveniently prepared. Films with a thickness of tens of pm can be prepared, if desired, when the anodization is carried out over extended periods of time (12 to 24 h). The thickness of the film can be determined, e.g., by cutting the metal oxide film and the metal substrate in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the substrate in a central region of the metal oxide film, and by obtaining a micrograph (e.g., via SEM) through which the film thickness can be measured. The process of the present invention can be advantageously used to prepare a porous metal oxide film with a high surface area and a homogeneous pore structure. Typical metal oxide films prepared by the process in accordance with the invention contain open nanopores with a diameter ranging from 5 to 200 nm, preferably from 10 to 100 nm. They are preferably formed by nanochannels with an internal diameter ranging from 5 to 200 nm, preferably 10 to 100 nm, 'which are present in a metal oxide matrix. The metal oxide matrix comprises a plurality of such nanochannels which extend from the surface of the metal substrate towards the surface of the oxide film facing away from the surface of the metal substrate, and which have an opening at the end facing towards the surface of the oxide film such that a plurality of open nanopores is formed at the surface of the metal oxide film. In this context, the pore diameter can be conveniently determined from an SEM picture of the surface of the metal oxide film. As will be understood, in the case of open nanopores being formed by nanochannels which extend from the surface of the metal substrate towards the surface of the oxide film facing away from the surface of the metal substrate, and which have an opening at the end facing towards the surface of the oxide film, the pore diameter determined accordingly corresponds to the diameter of the open end of the nanochannels. The internal diameter of the nanochannels can be determined by cutting the metal oxide film and the metal substrate in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the substrate in a central region of the metal oxide film, therefore obtaining a micrograph (e.g., via SEM) through which the channel diameters can be measured (cf. , Figs. 1 and 7). As demonstrated in the micrographs provided in the annexed figures, the pores and the channels show very regular structures. However, in cases of doubt, the pore diameter is the largest diameter of the pore opening in the plane of the film surface, and the diameter of the channel is the largest diameter of the channel in a direction perpendicular to the channel wall. As a result of the method in accordance with the invention, metal oxide films are provided which are supported by the metal substrate. Once it has been prepared, the metal oxide film can be separated from the metal substrate to provide a freestanding metal oxide film, e.g.. by removing the metal substrate through selective dissolution. Thus, the invention also encompasses the process for the electrochemical formation of a metal oxide film as defined above, which comprises, as a further step subsequent to the step of anodizing the metal substrate in an electrolyte, the step of separating the metal oxide film from the metal substrate to provide a free standing metal oxide film. As explained above, the process of the present invention has been found to be efficient and versatile with respect to its applicability to metal substrates containing different valve metals. Moreover, the resulting metal oxide films are advantageous in terms of their chemical and mechanical stability, including their adherence to the metal substrate. However, it could be further established that the process can be applied to metal substrates comprising one or more valve metals from the transition metal series to provide transition metal oxide films that can be distinguished from prior art metal oxide films. As shall be explained below in more detail, these films have been found to provide characteristics that can be beneficially exploited in a number of applications. Thus, in accordance with a further aspect, the invention provides a metal substrate comprising a metal selected from W, Ti, Ta. Nb, Hf, Zr, V, Fe, Mg, Zn, Sn, Co and Ga. which metal substrate carries on its surface thereof a metal oxide film obtainable from the process in accordance with the invention, and which is further characterized in that the metal oxide film is provided by a metal oxide matrix comprising a plurality of channels which extend from the surface of the metal substrate towards the surface of the oxide film facing away from the surface of the metal substrate, and which have an opening at the end facing towards the surface of the oxide film such that a plurality of open pores is present at the surface of the metal oxide film. While a variety of different porous films of alumina have been prepared, films of transition metal oxides with highly ordered porous structures could previously be obtained only under specific conditions and with a limited number of morphologies. Reference is made, e.g., to films of Ti02 nanotubes (cf., P. Roy et al. , Ti02 nanotubes: synthesis and applications, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 50 (201 1 ) 2904 and the literature cited therein), which are prepared in an electrolyte containing substantial amounts of fluoride ions. Thus, metai oxide fiims are obtained which are formed by nanotubes arranged in a seif-organized manner on a substrate. As a result of the reaction conditions, a fluoride rich region is formed in the metal oxide film in the vicinity of the interface between the metal substrate and the metal oxide film. By contrast, the metal oxide films of the present invention have a more homogeneous composition, and in particular do not contain a fluoride containing region since they are obtainable via anodization in an electrolyte to which no fluoride containing compound is added. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the absence of such a fluoride containing region contributes to the stability of the metal oxide film, and to its excellent adherence to the metal substrate as demonstrated below. Moreover, as described above, the metal substrates carrying a metal oxide film claimed herein which are obtainable from the process in accordance with the present invention are characterized in that the metal oxide film is provided by a metal oxide matrix comprising a plurality of channels. These channels extend from the surface of the metal substrate towards the surface of the oxide film facing away from the surface of the metal substrate. Moreover, they have an opening at the end facing towards the surface of the oxide film, such that a plurality of open pores is present at the surface of the metal oxide film. It will be understood that, unless stated otherwise, the explanations, definitions and preferred definitions provided above in the discussion of the process of the invention also apply for the product of the invention, which is obtainable from this process. Nevertheless, for completeness' sake, some characteristics of the metal substrate carrying the metal oxide film shall be specifically discussed in the following although some overlap with the preceding parts of the description may result. As for the valve metal, those novel products are claimed wherein the metal substrate comprises a metal selected from W, Ti. Ta. Nb, Hf, Zr, V, Fe, Mg. Zn, Sn, Co and Ga. More preferred is a metal selected from W, Ti. Ta. Nb, Hf and Zr. Further preferred is a metal selected from W. Ti, and Nb. and particularly preferred is a metal selected from W and Ti.

More preferably, more than 70% by weight, and in particular more than 90% by weight of the metal substrate is provided by one or more of the metals listed above. It is particularly preferred that the metal substrate consists of one or more of the metals listed above, in particular of one or more valve metals selected from W, Ti and Nb. Most preferably, the metal substrate is formed from one of W or Ti, and in particular from Ti.

The open pores on the surface of the metal oxide film generally have pore diameters in the range of 5 to 200 nm, preferably in the range of 10 to 100 nm. As will be understood, for the open pores being formed by channels which extend from the surface of the metal substrate towards the surface of the oxide film facing away from the surface of the metal substrate, and which have an opening at the end facing towards the surface of the oxide film, the pore diameter corresponds to the diameter of the open end of the nanochannels. Moreover, the channels in the metal oxide matrix are preferably non-branched channels having two ends that have an opening at the end facing towards the surface of the oxide film. Preferably, they have a length of 100 nm or more, as determined by cutting the metal oxide film and the metal substrate in a direction perpendicular to the surface of the substrate in a central region of the metal oxide film, and obtaining a micrograph (e.g., via SEM) through which the length of the channels can be measured. It is further preferred that the channels have a ratio of their length to the diameter of the opening at the end facing towards the surface of the oxide film (i.e., the aspect-ratio) of 5 or more, in particular 10 or more. In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, a free standing metal oxide film is provided which is obtainable by separating and removing the metal substrate from the metal substrate carrying a metal oxide film in accordance with the invention as described above. The metal substrates carrying a metal oxide film obtainable from the process in accordance with the invention are useful for a broad variety of applications where the inertness of an oxidic surface or the increase of the surface area at the substrate surface can be exploited. For example, the oxide film may be applied to provide wear resistance or electrical resistance, to provide colors or textures, or as a substrate for colors, paints, metal plating and adhesives With regard to known applications of nanostructured films of metal oxides, and in particular Ti02, reference can be made to P. Roy et a/. , Ti02 nanotubes: synthesis and applications, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 50 (201 1 ) 2904. As shown in the annexed examples, the oxide films prepared in accordance with the invention are particularly useful as substrates for adhesives so as to promote the formation of adhesive bonds of high stability between a metal substrate in accordance with the invention and another part, which may also be a metal substrate in accordance with the invention, or which may be formed from another material. This characteristic can be exploited, e.g., for the formation of lightweight bonded elements of Ti or alloys containing Ti.

The type of adhesive used to form such a bonded element is not particularly limited. For example, an epoxy or an acrylate adhesive may be used. As commercial adhesives, reference may be made, e.g., to a series of epoxy-, bismaleimide- (BMI), phenolic-, polyimide- and cyanate ester-based adhesives offered by Cytec for composite-to-composite, composite-to-metal and metal-to-metal bondings.

EXAMPLES The invention will be further described by reference to the following examples. It should be understood that these examples are intended to illustrate rather than to limit the invention. Example 1 An electrolyte solution was prepared by melting crystallized ortho-phosphoric acid (purity≥ 99 %) at about 50°C. Once liquid, the electrolyte was cooled down to 20°C and used as an electrolyte for anodizing. Aluminum samples were prepared by cutting aluminum foil (thickness 0.125 mm, purity 99.5 %) to pieces of 1 cm x 2 cm. Samples were then degreased by ultrasound treatment in acetone, ethanol and finally deionized water. Each treatment was carried out for 10 minutes. Afterwards, aluminum pieces were dried in a N2 flow. Aluminum anodic porous films were formed in a two electrode electrochemical cell where the valve metal was positively biased whereas a Pt foil (1 cm x 1 cm) worked as a counter electrode. Distance between working and counter electrode was kept constant at 2 cm. Anodization was carried out by applying a constant potential of 40 V for different periods of time, including 1 , 10, 30 and 60 min. After anodization, the anodic porous films were immersed in deionized water overnight and then dried in a N2 flow As a result of said process, the anodic films were transparent (the anodized surface exhibits almost the same sheen compared to the untreated part) and adhered well on the substrate. SEM pictures (Fig. 1 ) of the anodic film anodized in said conditions for 1 minute show that the layer was uniformly porous, consisting of closely packed self-assembled alumina pores, with average pore size of about 50 nm (determined from the SEM picture). This was observed regardless of the length of the anodization time. In case of a short anodization time (in the range of few minutes), the layer was thin (hundreds of nanometers) and quite smooth on top. On the contrary, longer anodization time (60 min) gave a thicker layer with average thickness about 1.8 Mm, as shown in the diagram of Fig. 2. The film thickness was determined from the SEM picture of a cross-section of the film. Example 2 An electrolyte solution was prepared by melting crystallized ortho-phosphoric acid (purity≥ 99 %) at about 100°C. Once the electrolyte reached said temperature, it was used for anodizing. Titanium samples were prepared by cutting titanium foil (thickness 0.125 mm, purity 97 %) to pieces of 1.5 cm x 2 cm. Samples were then degreased by ultrasound treatment in acetone, ethanol and finally deionized water. Each treatment was carried out for 10 minutes. Afterwards, titanium pieces were dried in a N2 flow. Titanium anodic porous films were formed in a two electrode electrochemical cell where the valve metal was positively biased whereas a Pt foil (1 cm x 1 cm) worked as a counter electrode. Distance between working and counter electrode was kept constant at 2 cm. Anodization was carried out by applying a constant potential of 1 V for 3 h at 100 °C. After anodization, the anodic porous films were immersed in deionized water overnight and then dried In a N2 flow. The SEM picture (Fig. 3) of the anodic film shows that the layer was uniformly porous, with an average pore size of about 50 nm (as determined from the SEM picture). Example 3 An electrolyte solution was prepared by melting crystallized pyrophosphoric acid (purity≥ 90 %) at about 120CC. Once the electrolyte reached said temperature, it was used for anodizing a tungsten substrate. Tungsten samples were prepared by cutting tungsten metal foils (thickness 0.125 mm, purity 99.95 %) to pieces of 1 cm x 2 cm. Samples were then degreased by ultrasound treatment in acetone, ethanol and finally deionized water. Each treatment was carried out for 10 minutes. Afterwards, the metal pieces were dried in a N2 flow. Tungsten anodic porous films were formed in a two electrode electrochemical cell where the valve metal was positively biased whereas a Pt foil (1 cm x 1 cm) worked as a counter electrode. Distance between working and counter electrode was kept constant at 2 cm. Anodization was carried out by applying a constant potential of 5 V for 1 h at 120 °C. After anodization. the anodic porous films were immersed in isopropyl aicohoi overnight and then dried in a N2 flow. As a result of said process, the anodic films were still shiny, many-colored and adhered well onto the substrate. SEM top view pictures (Figs. 4 and 5) of the anodic film show that the layer exhibited a smooth top surface and was uniformly porous, with an average pore size ranging from 9 to 12 nm (determined from the SEM picture). Cross-section pictures (Fig. 6 and 7) show that the anodic layer grew to a thickness of about 1.1 m (determined from the SEM picture) and was characterized by well-packed, straight and aligned nanochannels, with an inner diameter in the range of 15 to 20 nm. Example 4 An electrolyte solution was prepared by melting crystallized ortho-phosphoric acid (purity≥ 99 %) at about 120°C. Once the electrolyte reached said temperature, was cooled down to 100°C and used for anodizing a niobium substrate. Niobium samples were prepared by cutting metal foils (Nb: thickness 0.125 mm, purity 99.9 %) to pieces of 1 cm x 2 cm. Samples were then degreased by ultrasound treatment in acetone, ethanol and finally delonized water. Each treatment was carried out for 10 minutes. Afterwards, the metal pieces were dried in a N2 flow. Niobium anodic porous films were formed in a two electrode electrochemical cell where the valve metal was positively biased whereas a Pt foil (1 cm x 1 cm) worked as a counter electrode. Distance between working and counter electrode was kept constant at 2 cm. Anodization was carried out by applying a constant potential of 10 V for 1 h. After anodization, the anodic porous films were immersed in deionized water overnight and then dried in a N2 flow. SEM top-view pictures (Figs. 8 and 9) of the anodic film show that the layer exhibited a smooth top surface and was uniformly porous, with an average pore size, determined from the SEM picture, ranging from 15 to 20 nm. A cross-section picture (Fig. 10) shows that the anodic layer grew to about 0.9 pm and was characterized by nanochannels exhibiting an inner diameter of around 20 nm (determined from the SEM picture). Example 5 To demonstrate the tensile strength of an adhesive bond formed between metal substrates carrying a metal oxide film in accordance with the invention, the following test was carried out: Four pieces of Ti foil (0.5 mm thick, 1 .5 cm x 3 cm) were anodized in ortho-phosphoric acid at a potential of 2 5 V for 1 h at 100 °C. These samples were labeled as Samples #1 to #4 and were anodized under identical conditions to show the reproducibility in the process and obtained properties. Conventional Ti02 nanotube oxide films were prepared as reference material by anodizing Ti foil (0.5 mm thick, 1.5 cm x 3 cm) in 1 M NaH2P04 + 0.125 M HF aqueous solution, at 20 V for 10min (at room temperature). The thickness of the metal oxide film of the anodized Ti02 in accordance with the invention and the conventional Ti02 nanotube sample were around 200 nm. In the subsequent test for tensile strength, two test pieces obtained under the same conditions were boned together with Duralco 4535 (Cotronics Corp., Brooklyn, NY, USA), a fast-hardening two component structural adhesive (epoxy) with a high bond and peel strength, to get an overlap of 0.78 cm2. The shear strength of the bond was measured by using a Z050 instrument (Zwick. Ulm, Germany) equipped with a 1 kN pressure socket and a shear rate of 1 mm/s in accordance with German industry testing standard DIN 53 283 as schematically shown in Fig. 1 1. The results are shown in the diagram in Fig. 12, where "P- anodize" indicates a sample prepared from metal substrates carrying metal oxide films In accordance with the invention. As can be seen from the resulting curves, the samples in accordance with the invention provide an excellent basis for adhesives, and allow strong adhesive bonds to be obtained.
