The invention also relates to a composition suitable for use in a process of the invention. REFERENCE TO A SEQUENCE LISTING This application contains a Sequence Listing in computer readable form. The computer readable form is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Production of fermentation products, such as ethanol, from starch-containing material is well-known in the art. Industrially two different kinds of processes are used today. The most commonly used process, often referred to as a “conventional process”, and includes liquefying gelatinized starch at high temperature using typically a bacterial alpha-amylase, followed by simultaneous saccharification and fermentation carried out in the presence of a glucoamylase and a fermentation organism. Another well-known process, often referred to as a “raw starch hydrolysis”-process (RSH process), includes simultaneously saccharifying and fermenting granular starch below the initial gelatization temperature typically in the presence of at least a glucoamylase. Despite significant improvement of fermentation product production processes over the past decade a significant amount of residual starch material is not converted into the desired fermentation product, such as ethanol. At least some of the unconverted residual starch material, e.g., sugars and dextrins, is in the form of non-fermentable Maillard products. Therefore, there is still a desire and need for providing processes for producing fermentation products, such as ethanol, from starch-containing material that can provide a higher fermentation product yield, or other advantages, compared to a conventional process. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to processes of producing fermentation products, such as ethanol, from starch-containing material using a fermenting organism. In the first aspect the invention relates to processes for producing fermentation products, such as ethanol, from starch-containing material comprising the steps of: i) liquefying the starch-containing material at a temperature above the initial gelatinization temperature using: an alpha-amylase;optionally a protease having a thermostability value of more than 20% determined as Relative Activity at 80° C./70° C.; andoptionally a carbohydrate-source generating enzyme; ii) saccharifying using a carbohydrate-source generating enzyme; iii) fermenting using a fermenting organism; wherein a cellulolytic composition is present or added during fermentation or simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. Suitable cellulolytic compositions are described below. In a preferred embodiment the cellulolytic composition is derived from Trichoderma reesei. In a preferred embodiment liquefaction is carried out at a temperature between from 70-100° C., such as between 75-95° C., such as between 75-90° C., preferably between 80-90° C., such as 82-88° C., such as around 85° C.

DEFINITIONS Enzymes: Cellulolytic composition, cellulolytic enzymes or cellulase means a preparation comprising one or more (e.g., several) enzymes that hydrolyze a cellulosic material. Such enzymes include endoglucanase(s), cellobiohydrolase(s), beta-glucosidase(s), or combinations thereof. The two basic approaches for measuring cellulolytic activity include: (1) measuring the total cellulolytic activity, and (2) measuring the individual cellulolytic activities (endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, and beta-glucosidases) as reviewed in Zhang et al., Outlook for cellulase improvement: Screening and selection strategies, 2006, Biotechnology Advances 24: 452-481. Total cellulolytic activity is usually measured using insoluble substrates, including Whatman No1 filter paper, microcrystalline cellulose, bacterial cellulose, algal cellulose, cotton, pretreated lignocellulose, etc. The most common total cellulolytic activity assay is the filter paper assay using Whatman No1 filter paper as the substrate. The assay was established by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) (Ghose, 1987, Measurement of cellulase activities, Pure Appl. Chem. 59: 257-68). Cellulolytic enzyme activity is determined by measuring the increase in hydrolysis of a cellulosic material by cellulolytic enzyme(s) under the following conditions: 1-50 mg of cellulolytic enzyme protein/g of cellulose in Pretreated Corn Stover (“PCS”) (or other pretreated cellulosic material) for 3-7 days at a suitable temperature, e.g., 50° C., 55° C., or 60° C., compared to a control hydrolysis without addition of cellulolytic enzyme protein. Typical conditions are 1 ml reactions, washed or unwashed PCS, 5% insoluble solids, 50 mM sodium acetate pH 5, 1 mM MnSO4, 50° C., 55° C., or 60° C., 72 hours, sugar analysis by AMINEX® HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, Calif., USA). Family 61 glycoside hydrolase: The term “Family 61 glycoside hydrolase” or “Family GH61” or “GH61” means a polypeptide falling into the glycoside hydrolase Family 61 according to Henrissat B., 1991, A classification of glycosyl hydrolases based on amino-acid sequence similarities, Biochem. J. 280: 309-316, and Henrissat B., and Bairoch A., 1996, Updating the sequence-based classification of glycosyl hydrolases, Biochem. J. 316: 695-696. The enzymes in this family were originally classified as a glycoside hydrolase family based on measurement of very weak endo-1,4-beta-D-glucanase activity in one family member. The structure and mode of action of these enzymes are non-canonical and they cannot be considered as bona fide glycosidases. However, they are kept in the CAZy classification on the basis of their capacity to enhance the breakdown of lignocellulose when used in conjunction with a cellulase or a mixture of cellulases. Polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity: The term “polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity” means a GH61 polypeptide that catalyzes the enhancement of the hydrolysis of a cellulosic material by enzyme having cellulolytic activity. For purposes of the present invention, cellulolytic enhancing activity is determined by measuring the increase in reducing sugars or the increase of the total of cellobiose and glucose from the hydrolysis of a cellulosic material by cellulolytic enzyme under the following conditions: 1-50 mg of total protein/g of cellulose in PCS, wherein total protein is comprised of 50-99.5% w/w cellulolytic enzyme protein and 0.5-50% w/w protein of a GH61 polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity for 1-7 days at a suitable temperature, e.g., 50° C., 55° C., or 60° C., and pH, e.g., 5.0 or 5.5, compared to a control hydrolysis with equal total protein loading without cellulolytic enhancing activity (1-50 mg of cellulolytic protein/g of cellulose in PCS). In an aspect, a mixture of CELLUCLAST® 1.5 L (Novozymes NS, Bagsværd, Denmark) in the presence of 2-3% of total protein weight Aspergillus oryzae beta-glucosidase (recombinantly produced in Aspergillus oryzae according to WO 02/095014) or 2-3% of total protein weight Aspergillus fumigatus beta-glucosidase (recombinantly produced in Aspergillus oryzae as described in WO 2002/095014) of cellulase protein loading is used as the source of the cellulolytic activity. The GH61 polypeptide having cellulolytic enhancing activity enhance the hydrolysis of a cellulosic material catalyzed by enzyme having cellulolytic activity by reducing the amount of cellulolytic enzyme required to reach the same degree of hydrolysis preferably at least 1.01-fold, e.g., at least 1.05-fold, at least 1.10-fold, at least 1.25-fold, at least 1.5-fold, at least 2-fold, at least 3-fold, at least 4-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 10-fold, or at least 20-fold. Beta-glucosidase: The term “beta-glucosidase” means a beta-D-glucoside glucohydrolase (E.C. 3.2.1.21) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of terminal non-reducing beta-D-glucose residues with the release of beta-D-glucose. For purposes of the present invention, beta-glucosidase activity is determined using p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside as substrate according to the procedure of Venturi et al., 2002, Extracellular beta-D-glucosidase from Chaetomium thermophilum var. coprophilum: production, purification and some biochemical properties, J. Basic Microbiol. 42: 55-66. One unit of beta-glucosidase is defined as 1.0 μmole of p-nitrophenolate anion produced per minute at 25° C., pH 4.8 from 1 mM p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside as substrate in 50 mM sodium citrate containing 0.01% TWEEN® 20 (polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate). Cellobiohydrolase: The term “cellobiohydrolase” means a 1,4-beta-D-glucan cellobiohydrolase (E.C. 3.2.1.91) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D-glucosidic linkages in cellulose, cellooligosaccharides, or any beta-1,4-linked glucose containing polymer, releasing cellobiose from the reducing or non-reducing ends of the chain (Teeri, 1997, Crystalline cellulose degradation: New insight into the function of cellobiohydrolases, Trends in Biotechnology 15: 160-167; Teeri et al., 1998, Trichoderma reesei cellobiohydrolases: why so efficient on crystalline cellulose?, Biochem. Soc. Trans. 26: 173-178). Cellobiohydrolase activity is determined according to the procedures described by Lever et al., 1972, Anal. Biochem. 47: 273-279; van Tilbeurgh et al., 1982, FEBS Letters, 149: 152-156; van Tilbeurgh and Claeyssens, 1985, FEBS Letters, 187: 283-288; and Tomme et al., 1988, Eur. J. Biochem. 170: 575-581. In the present invention, the Tomme et al. method can be used to determine cellobiohydrolase activity. Endoglucanase: The term “endoglucanase” means an endo-1,4-(1,3; 1,4)-beta-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase (E.C. 3.2.1.4) that catalyzes endohydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D-glycosidic linkages in cellulose, cellulose derivatives (such as carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose), lichenin, beta-1,4 bonds in mixed beta-1,3 glucans such as cereal beta-D-glucans or xyloglucans, and other plant material containing cellulosic components. Endoglucanase activity can be determined by measuring reduction in substrate viscosity or increase in reducing ends determined by a reducing sugar assay (Zhang et al., 2006, Biotechnology Advances 24: 452-481). For purposes of the present invention, endoglucanase activity is determined using carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) as substrate according to the procedure of Ghose, 1987, Pure and Appl. Chem. 59: 257-268, at pH 5, 40° C. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to processes of producing fermentation products, such as ethanol from starch-containing material using a fermenting organism. In the first aspect the invention relates to processes for producing fermentation products, preferably ethanol, comprising the steps of: i) liquefying the starch-containing material at a temperature above the initial gelatinization temperature using: an alpha-amylase;optionally a protease having a thermostability value of more than 20% determined as Relative Activity at 80° C./70° C.; andoptionally a carbohydrate-source generating enzyme; ii) saccharifying using a carbohydrate-source generating enzyme; iii) fermenting using a fermenting organism; wherein a cellulolytic composition is present or added during fermentation or simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. Steps ii) and iii) are carried out either sequentially or simultaneously. In a preferred embodiment steps ii) and iii) are carried out simultaneously. The alpha-amylase, optional thermostable protease, optional carbohydrate-source generating enzyme, preferably glucoamylase, and/or, optional a pullulanase, may be added before and/or during liquefaction step i). A composition of the invention may suitably be used in a process of the invention. However, the enzymes may also be added separately. Examples of alpha-amylases can be found in the “Alpha-Amylase Present and/or Added During Liquefaction”-section below. Examples of thermostable proteases can be found in the “Protease Present and/or Added During Liquefaction”-section below. Examples of suitable optional carbohydrate-source generating enzymes, preferably thermostable carbohydrate-source generating enzymes, in particular a thermostable glucoamylase, can be found in the “Carbohydrate-Source Generating Enzymes Present and/or Added During Liquefaction”-section below. A suitable optional pullulanase can be found in the “Pullulanase Present and/or Added During Liquefaction”-section below. The pH during liquefaction may be between 4-7. In an embodiment the pH during liquefaction is from 4.5-5.0, such as between 4.5-4.8. In another embodiment liquefaction is carried out at a pH above 5.0-6.5, such as above 5.0-6.0, such as above 5.0-5.5, such as between 5.2-6.2, such as around 5.2, such as around 5.4, such as around 5.6, such as around 5.8. According to the invention the temperature is above the initial gelatinization temperature. The term “initial gelatinization temperature” refers to the lowest temperature at which solubilization of starch, typically by heating, begins. The temperature can vary for different starches. In an embodiment the temperature during liquefaction step i) is in the range from 70-100° C., such as between 75-95° C., such as between 75-90° C., preferably between 80-90° C., such as between 82-88° C., such as around 85° C. In an embodiment, the process of the invention further comprises, prior to the step i), the steps of: a) reducing the particle size of the starch-containing material, preferably by dry milling; b) forming a slurry comprising the starch-containing material and water. The starch-containing starting material, such as whole grains, may be reduced in particle size, e.g., by milling, in order to open up the structure, to increase surface area, and allowing for further processing. Generally there are two types of processes: wet and dry milling. In dry milling whole kernels are milled and used. Wet milling gives a good separation of germ and meal (starch granules and protein). Wet milling is often applied at locations where the starch hydrolysate is used in production of, e.g., syrups. Both dry and wet milling are well known in the art of starch processing. According to the present invention dry milling is preferred. In an embodiment the particle size is reduced to between 0.05 to 3.0 mm, preferably 0.1-0.5 mm, or so that at least 30%, preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 70%, even more preferably at least 90% of the starch-containing material fit through a sieve with a 0.05 to 3.0 mm screen, preferably 0.1-0.5 mm screen. In another embodiment at least 50%, preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, especially at least 90% of the starch-containing material fit through a sieve with #6 screen. The aqueous slurry may contain from 10-55 w/w-% dry solids (DS), preferably 25-45 w/w-% dry solids (DS), more preferably 30-40 w/w-% dry solids (DS) of starch-containing material. The slurry may be heated to above the initial gelatinization temperature, preferably to between 80-90° C., between pH 4-7, preferably between 4.5-5.0 or 5.0 and 6.0, for 30 minutes to 5 hours, such as around 2 hours. The alpha-amylase, optional thermostable protease, optional carbohydrate-source generating enzyme, in particular thermostable glucoamylase, and/or optional pullulanase may initially be added to the aqueous slurry to initiate liquefaction (thinning). In an embodiment only a portion of the enzymes is added to the aqueous slurry, while the rest of the enzymes are added during liquefaction step i). Liquefaction step i) is according to the invention carried out for 0.5-5 hours, such as 1-3 hours, such as typically around 2 hours. The aqueous slurry may in an embodiment be jet-cooked to further gelatinize the slurry before being subjected to liquefaction in step i). The jet-cooking may be carried out at a temperature between 110-145° C., preferably 120-140° C., such as 125-135° C., preferably around 130° C. for about 1-15 minutes, preferably for about 3-10 minutes, especially around about 5 minutes. Saccharification and Fermentation One or more carbohydrate-source generating enzymes, in particular glucoamylase, may be present and/or added during saccharification step ii) and/or fermentation step iii). The carbohydrate-source generating enzyme may preferably be a glucoamylase, but may also be an enzyme selected from the group consisting of: beta-amylase, maltogenic amylase and alpha-glucosidase. The carbohydrate-source generating enzyme added during saccharification step ii) and/or fermentation step iii) is typically different from the optional carbohydrate-source generating enzyme, in particular thermostable glucoamylase, optionally added during liquefaction step i). In a preferred embodiment the carbohydrate-source generating enzymes, in particular glucoamylase, is added together with a fungal alpha-amylase. Examples of carbohydrate-source generating enzymes, including glucoamylases, can be found in the “Carbohydrate-Source Generating Enzyme Present and/or Added During Saccharification and/or Fermentation”-section below. When doing sequential saccharification and fermentation, saccharification step ii) may be carried out at conditions well-known in the art. For instance, the saccharification step ii) may last up to from about 24 to about 72 hours. In an embodiment pre-saccharification is done. Pre-saccharification is typically done for 40-90 minutes at a temperature between 30-65° C., typically about 60° C. Pre-saccharification is in an embodiment followed by saccharification during fermentation in simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (“SSF). Saccharification is typically carried out at temperatures from 20-75° C., preferably from 40-70° C., typically around 60° C., and at a pH between 4 and 5, normally at about pH 4.5. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (“SSF”) is widely used in industrial scale fermentation product production processes, especially ethanol production processes. When doing SSF the saccharification step ii) and the fermentation step iii) are carried out simultaneously. There is no holding stage for the saccharification, meaning that a fermenting organism, such as yeast, and enzyme(s), may be added together. However, it is also contemplated to add the fermenting organism and enzyme(s) separately. SSF is according to the invention typically carried out at a temperature from 25° C. to 40° C., such as from 28° C. to 35° C., such as from 30° C. to 34° C., preferably around about 32° C. In an embodiment fermentation is ongoing for 6 to 120 hours, in particular 24 to 96 hours. In an embodiment the pH is between 3.5-5, in particular between 3.8 and 4.3. Fermentation Medium “Fermentation media” or “fermentation medium” refers to the environment in which fermentation is carried out. The fermentation medium includes the fermentation substrate, that is, the carbohydrate source that is metabolized by the fermenting organism. According to the invention the fermentation medium may comprise nutrients and growth stimulator(s) for the fermenting organism(s). Nutrient and growth stimulators are widely used in the art of fermentation and include nitrogen sources, such as ammonia; urea, vitamins and minerals, or combinations thereof. Fermenting Organisms The term “Fermenting organism” refers to any organism, including bacterial and fungal organisms, especially yeast, suitable for use in a fermentation process and capable of producing the desired fermentation product. Especially suitable fermenting organisms are able to ferment, i.e., convert, sugars, such as glucose or maltose, directly or indirectly into the desired fermentation product, such as ethanol. Examples of fermenting organisms include fungal organisms, such as yeast. Preferred yeast includes strains of Saccharomyces spp., in particular, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Suitable concentrations of the viable fermenting organism during fermentation, such as SSF, are well known in the art or can easily be determined by the skilled person in the art. In one embodiment the fermenting organism, such as ethanol fermenting yeast, (e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is added to the fermentation medium so that the viable fermenting organism, such as yeast, count per mL of fermentation medium is in the range from 105 to 1012, preferably from 107 to 1010, especially about 5×107. Examples of commercially available yeast includes, e.g., RED START™ and ETHANOL RED™ yeast (available from Fermentis/Lesaffre, USA), FALI (available from Fleischmann's Yeast, USA), SUPERSTART and THERMOSACC™ fresh yeast (available from Ethanol Technology, WI, USA), BIOFERM AFT and XR (available from NABC—North American Bioproducts Corporation, GA, USA), GERT STRAND (available from Gert Strand AB, Sweden), and FERMIOL (available from DSM Specialties). Starch-Containing Materials Any suitable starch-containing material may be used according to the present invention. The starting material is generally selected based on the desired fermentation product. Examples of starch-containing materials, suitable for use in a process of the invention, include whole grains, corn, wheat, barley, rye, milo, sago, cassava, tapioca, sorghum, rice, peas, beans, or sweet potatoes, or mixtures thereof or starches derived there from, or cereals. Contemplated are also waxy and non-waxy types of corn and barley. In a preferred embodiment the starch-containing material, used for ethanol production according to the invention, is corn or wheat. Fermentation Products The term “fermentation product” means a product produced by a process including a fermentation step using a fermenting organism. Fermentation products contemplated according to the invention include alcohols (e.g., ethanol, methanol, butanol; polyols such as glycerol, sorbitol and inositol); organic acids (e.g., citric acid, acetic acid, itaconic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, gluconic acid); ketones (e.g., acetone); amino acids (e.g., glutamic acid); gases (e.g., H2 and CO2); antibiotics (e.g., penicillin and tetracycline); enzymes; vitamins (e.g., riboflavin, B12, beta-carotene); and hormones. In a preferred embodiment the fermentation product is ethanol, e.g., fuel ethanol; drinking ethanol, i.e., potable neutral spirits; or industrial ethanol or products used in the consumable alcohol industry (e.g., beer and wine), dairy industry (e.g., fermented dairy products), leather industry and tobacco industry. Preferred beer types comprise ales, stouts, porters, lagers, bitters, malt liquors, happoushu, high-alcohol beer, low-alcohol beer, low-calorie beer or light beer. Preferably processes of the invention are used for producing an alcohol, such as ethanol. The fermentation product, such as ethanol, obtained according to the invention, may be used as fuel, which is typically blended with gasoline. However, in the case of ethanol it may also be used as potable ethanol. Recovery Subsequent to fermentation, or SSF, the fermentation product may be separated from the fermentation medium. The slurry may be distilled to extract the desired fermentation product (e.g., ethanol). Alternatively the desired fermentation product may be extracted from the fermentation medium by micro or membrane filtration techniques. The fermentation product may also be recovered by stripping or other method well known in the art.

Methods Identity: The relatedness between two amino acid sequences or between two nucleotide sequences is described by the parameter “identity”. For purposes of the present invention the degree of identity between two amino acid sequences, as well as the degree of identity between two nucleotide sequences, may be determined by the program “align” which is a Needleman-Wunsch alignment (i.e. a global alignment). The program is used for alignment of polypeptide, as well as nucleotide sequences. The default scoring matrix BLOSUM50 is used for polypeptide alignments, and the default identity matrix is used for nucleotide alignments. The penalty for the first residue of a gap is −12 for polypeptides and −16 for nucleotides. The penalties for further residues of a gap are −2 for polypeptides, and −4 for nucleotides. “Align” is part of the FASTA package version v20u6 (see W. R. Pearson and D. J. Lipman (1988), “Improved Tools for Biological Sequence Analysis”, PNAS 85:2444-2448, and W. R. Pearson (1990) “Rapid and Sensitive Sequence Comparison with FASTP and FASTA,” Methods in Enzymology 183:63-98). FASTA protein alignments use the Smith-Waterman algorithm with no limitation on gap size (see “Smith-Waterman algorithm”, T. F. Smith and M. S. Waterman (1981) J. Mol. Biol. 147:195-197). Protease Assays AZCL-Casein Assay A solution of 0.2% of the blue substrate AZCL-casein is suspended in Borax/NaH2PO4 buffer pH9 while stirring. The solution is distributed while stirring to microtiter plate (100 microL to each well), 30 microL enzyme sample is added and the plates are incubated in an Eppendorf Thermomixer for 30 minutes at 45° C. and 600 rpm. Denatured enzyme sample (100° C. boiling for 20 min) is used as a blank. After incubation the reaction is stopped by transferring the microtiter plate onto ice and the coloured solution is separated from the solid by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes at 4° C. 60 microL of supernatant is transferred to a microtiter plate and the absorbance at 595 nm is measured using a BioRad Microplate Reader. pNA-Assay 50 microL protease-containing sample is added to a microtiter plate and the assay is started by adding 100 microL 1 mM pNA substrate (5 mg dissolved in 100 microL DMSO and further diluted to 10 mL with Borax/NaH2PO4 buffer pH 9.0). The increase in OD405 at room temperature is monitored as a measure of the protease activity. Glucoamylase Activity (AGU) Glucoamylase activity may be measured in Glucoamylase Units (AGU). The Novo Glucoamylase Unit (AGU) is defined as the amount of enzyme, which hydrolyzes 1 micromole maltose per minute under the standard conditions 37° C., pH 4.3, substrate: maltose 23.2 mM, buffer: acetate 0.1 M, reaction time 5 minutes. An autoanalyzer system may be used. Mutarotase is added to the glucose dehydrogenase reagent so that any alpha-D-glucose present is turned into beta-D-glucose. Glucose dehydrogenase reacts specifically with beta-D-glucose in the reaction mentioned above, forming NADH which is determined using a photometer at 340 nm as a measure of the original glucose concentration. AMG incubation: Substrate: maltose 23.2 mM Buffer: acetate 0.1M pH: 4.30 ± 0.05 Incubation temperature: 37° C. ± 1 Reaction time: 5 minutes Enzyme working range: 0.5-4.0 AGU/mL Color reaction: GlucDH: 430 U/L Mutarotase: 9 U/L NAD: 0.21 mM Buffer: phosphate 0.12M; 0.15M NaCl pH: 7.60 ± 0.05 Incubation temperature: 37° C. ± 1 Reaction time: 5 minutes Wavelength: 340 nm A folder (EB-SM-0131.02/01) describing this analytical method in more detail is available on request from Novozymes NS, Denmark, which folder is hereby included by reference. Acid Alpha-Amylase Activity (AFAU) Acid alpha-amylase activity may be measured in AFAU (Acid Fungal Alpha-amylase Units), which are determined relative to an enzyme standard. 1 AFAU is defined as the amount of enzyme which degrades 5.260 mg starch dry matter per hour under the below mentioned standard conditions. Acid alpha-amylase, an endo-alpha-amylase (1,4-alpha-D-glucan-glucanohydrolase, E.C. 3.2.1.1) hydrolyzes alpha-1,4-glucosidic bonds in the inner regions of the starch molecule to form dextrins and oligosaccharides with different chain lengths. The intensity of color formed with iodine is directly proportional to the concentration of starch. Amylase activity is determined using reverse colorimetry as a reduction in the concentration of starch under the specified analytical conditions. Standard Conditions/Reaction Conditions: Substrate: Soluble starch, approx. 0.17 g/LBuffer: Citrate, approx. 0.03 MIodine (I2): 0.03 g/LCaCl2: 1.85 mMpH: 2.50±0.05Incubation temperature: 40° C.Reaction time: 23 secondsWavelength: 590 nmEnzyme concentration: 0.025 AFAU/mLEnzyme working range: 0.01-0.04 AFAU/mL A folder EB-SM-0259.02/01 describing this analytical method in more detail is available upon request to Novozymes NS, Denmark, which folder is hereby included by reference. Alpha-Amylase Activity (KNU) The alpha-amylase activity may be determined using potato starch as substrate. This method is based on the break-down of modified potato starch by the enzyme, and the reaction is followed by mixing samples of the starch/enzyme solution with an iodine solution. Initially, a blackish-blue color is formed, but during the break-down of the starch the blue color gets weaker and gradually turns into a reddish-brown, which is compared to a colored glass standard. One Kilo Novo alpha amylase Unit (KNU) is defined as the amount of enzyme which, under standard conditions (i.e., at 37° C.+/−0.05; 0.0003 M Ca2+; and pH 5.6) dextrinizes 5260 mg starch dry substance Merck Amylum solubile.

Determination of Pullulanase Activity (NPUN) Endo-pullulanase activity in NPUN is measured relative to a Novozymes pullulanase standard. One pullulanase unit (NPUN) is defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 1 micro mol glucose per minute under the standard conditions (0.7% red pullulan (Megazyme), pH 5, 40° C., 20 minutes). The activity is measured in NPUN/ml using red pullulan. 1 mL diluted sample or standard is incubated at 40° C. for 2 minutes. 0.5 mL 2% red pullulan, 0.5 M KCl, 50 mM citric acid, pH 5 are added and mixed. The tubes are incubated at 40° C. for 20 minutes and stopped by adding 2.5 ml 80% ethanol. The tubes are left standing at room temperature for 10-60 minutes followed by centrifugation 10 minutes at 4000 rpm. OD of the supernatants is then measured at 510 nm and the activity calculated using a standard curve. The present invention is described in further detail in the following examples which are offered to illustrate the present invention, but not in any way intended to limit the scope of the invention as claimed. All references cited herein are specifically incorporated by reference for that which is described therein. EXAMPLES Example 1 Stability of Alpha-Amylase Variants The stability of a reference alpha-amylase (Bacillus stearothermophilus alpha-amylase with the mutations I181*+G182*+N193F truncated to 491 amino acids (SEQ ID NO: 1 numbering)) and alpha-amylase variants thereof was determined by incubating the reference alpha-amylase and variants at pH 4.5 and 5.5 and temperatures of 75° C. and 85° C. with 0.12 mM CaCl2 followed by residual activity determination using the EnzChek® substrate (EnzChek® Ultra Amylase assay kit, E33651, Molecular Probes). Purified enzyme samples were diluted to working concentrations of 0.5 and 1 or 5 and 10 ppm (micrograms/ml) in enzyme dilution buffer (10 mM acetate, 0.01% Triton X100, 0.12 mM CaCl2, pH 5.0). Twenty microliters enzyme sample was transferred to 48-well PCR MTP and 180 microliters stability buffer (150 mM acetate, 150 mM MES, 0.01% Triton X100, 0.12 mM CaCl2, pH 4.5 or 5.5) was added to each well and mixed. The assay was performed using two concentrations of enzyme in duplicates. Before incubation at 75° C. or 85° C., 20 microliters was withdrawn and stored on ice as control samples. Incubation was performed in a PCR machine at 75° C. and 85° C. After incubation samples were diluted to 15 ng/mL in residual activity buffer (100 mM Acetate, 0.01% Triton X100, 0.12 mM CaCl2, pH 5.5) and 25 microliters diluted enzyme was transferred to black 384-MTP. Residual activity was determined using the EnzChek substrate by adding 25 microliters substrate solution (100 micrograms/ml) to each well. Fluorescence was determined every minute for 15 minutes using excitation filter at 485-P nm and emission filter at 555 nm (fluorescence reader is Polarstar, BMG). The residual activity was normalized to control samples for each setup. Assuming logarithmic decay half life time (T½ (min)) was calculated using the equation: T½(min)=T(min)*LN(0.5)/LN(% RA/100), where T is assay incubation time in minutes, and % RA is % residual activity determined in assay. Using this assay setup the half life time was determined for the reference alpha-amylase and variant thereof as shown in Table 1.

Example 2 Preparation of Protease Variants and Test of Thermostability Strains and Plasmids E. coli DH12S (available from Gibco BRL) was used for yeast plasmid rescue. pJTP000 is a S. cerevisiae and E. coli shuttle vector under the control of TPI promoter, constructed from pJC039 described in WO 01/92502, in which the Thermoascus aurantiacus M35 protease gene (WO 03048353) has been inserted. Saccharomyces cerevisiae YNG318 competent cells: MATa Dpep4[cir+] ura3-52, leu2-D2, his 4-539 was used for protease variants expression. It is described in J. Biol. Chem. 272 (15), pp 9720-9727, 1997. Media and Substrates 10× Basal Solution: Yeast nitrogen base w/o amino acids (DIFCO) 66.8 g/l, succinate 100 g/l, NaOH 60 g/l. SC-Glucose: 20% glucose (i.e., a final concentration of 2%=2 g/100 ml)) 100 ml/l, 5% threonine 4 ml/l, 1% tryptophan 10 ml/l, 20% casamino acids 25 ml/l, 10× basal solution 100 ml/l. The solution is sterilized using a filter of a pore size of 0.20 micrometer. Agar (2%) and H2O (approx. 761 ml) is autoclaved together, and the separately sterilized SC-glucose solution is added to the agar solution. YPD: Bacto peptone 20 g/l, yeast extract 10 g/l, 20% glucose 100 ml/l. YPD+Zn: YPD+0.25 mM ZnSO4 PEG/LiAc Solution: 40% PEG4000 50 ml, 5 M Lithium Acetate 1 ml. 96 Well Zein Micro Titre Plate: Each well contains 200 microL of 0.05-0.1% of zein (Sigma), 0.25 mM ZnSO4 and 1% of agar in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5. DNA Manipulations Unless otherwise stated, DNA manipulations and transformations were performed using standard methods of molecular biology as described in Sambrook et al. (1989) Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual, Cold Spring Harbor lab. Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.; Ausubel, F. M. et al. (eds.) “Current protocols in Molecular Biology”, John Wiley and Sons, 1995; Harwood, C. R. and Cutting, S. M. (Eds.). Yeast Transformation Yeast transformation was performed using the lithium acetate method. 0.5 microL of vector (digested by restriction endonucleases) and 1 microL of PCR fragments is mixed. The DNA mixture, 100 microL of YNG318 competent cells, and 10 microL of YEAST MAKER carrier DNA (Clontech) is added to a 12 ml polypropylene tube (Falcon 2059). Add 0.6 ml PEG/LiAc solution and mix gently. Incubate for 30 min at 30° C., and 200 rpm followed by 30 min at 42° C. (heat shock). Transfer to an eppendorf tube and centrifuge for 5 sec. Remove the supernatant and resolve in 3 ml of YPD. Incubate the cell suspension for 45 min at 200 rpm at 30° C. Pour the suspension to SC-glucose plates and incubate 30° C. for 3 days to grow colonies. Yeast total DNA are extracted by Zymoprep Yeast Plasmid Miniprep Kit (ZYMO research). DNA Sequencing E. coli transformation for DNA sequencing was carried out by electroporation (BIO-RAD Gene Pulser). DNA Plasmids were prepared by alkaline method (Molecular Cloning, Cold Spring Harbor) or with the Qiagen® Plasmid Kit. DNA fragments were recovered from agarose gel by the Qiagen gel extraction Kit. PCR was performed using a PTC-200 DNA Engine. The ABI PRISM™ 310 Genetic Analyzer was used for determination of all DNA sequences. Construction of Protease Expression Vector The Thermoascus M35 protease gene was amplified with the primer pair Prot F (SEQ ID NO: 4) and Prot R (SEQ ID NO: 5). The resulting PCR fragments were introduced into S. cerevisiae YNG318 together with the pJC039 vector (described in WO 2001/92502) digested with restriction enzymes to remove the Humicola insolens cutinase gene. The Plasmid in yeast clones on SC-glucose plates was recovered to confirm the internal sequence and termed as pJTP001. Construction of Yeast Library and Site-Directed Variants Library in yeast and site-directed variants were constructed by SOE PCR method (Splicing by Overlap Extension, see “PCR: A practical approach”, p. 207-209, Oxford University press, eds. McPherson, Quirke, Taylor), followed by yeast in vivo recombination. General Primers for Amplification and Sequencing The primers AM34 (SEQ ID NO:5) and AM35 (SEQ ID NO:6) were used to make DNA fragments containing any mutated fragments by the SOE method together with degenerated primers (AM34+Reverse primer and AM35+forward primer) or just to amplify a whole protease gene (AM34+AM35). PCR reaction system: Conditions: 48.5 microL H2O 1 94° C. 2 min 2 beads puRe Taq Ready-To-Go PCR (Amersham 2 94° C. 30 sec Biosciences) 3 55° C. 30 sec 0.5 micro L X 2 100 pmole/microL of primers 4 72° C. 90 sec 0.5 microL template DNA 2-4 25 cycles 5 72° C. 10 min DNA fragments were recovered from agarose gel by the Qiagen gel extraction Kit. The resulting purified fragments were mixed with the vector digest. The mixed solution was introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae to construct libraries or site-directed variants by in vivo recombination. Relative Activity Assay Yeast clones on SC-glucose were inoculated to a well of a 96-well micro titre plate containing YPD+Zn medium and cultivated at 28° C. for 3 days. The culture supernatants were applied to a 96-well zein micro titer plate and incubated at at least 2 temperatures (ex. 60° C. and 65° C., 70° C. and 75° C., 70° C. and 80° C.) for more than 4 hours or overnight. The turbidity of zein in the plate was measured as A630 and the relative activity (higher/lower temperatures) was determined as an indicator of thermoactivity improvement. The clones with higher relative activity than the parental variant were selected and the sequence was determined. Remaining Activity Assay Yeast clones on SC-glucose were inoculated to a well of a 96-well micro titre plate and cultivated at 28° C. for 3 days. Protease activity was measured at 65° C. using azo-casein (Megazyme) after incubating the culture supernatant in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, for 10 min at a certain temperature (80° C. or 84° C. with 4° C. as a reference) to determine the remaining activity. The clones with higher remaining activity than the parental variant were selected and the sequence was determined. Azo-Casein Assay 20 microL of samples were mixed with 150 microL of substrate solution (4 ml of 12.5% azo-casein in ethanol in 96 ml of 20 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, containing 0.01% triton-100 and 0.25 mM ZnSO4) and incubated for 4 hours or longer. After adding 20 microL/well of 100% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) solution, the plate was centrifuge and 100 microL of supernatants were pipette out to measure A440. Expression of Protease Variants in Aspergillus oryzae The constructs comprising the protease variant genes were used to construct expression vectors for Aspergillus. The Aspergillus expression vectors consist of an expression cassette based on the Aspergillus niger neutral amylase II promoter fused to the Aspergillus nidulans triose phosphate isomerase non translated leader sequence (Pna2/tpi) and the Aspergillus niger amyloglucosidase terminator (Tamg). Also present on the plasmid was the Aspergillus selective marker amdS from Aspergillus nidulans enabling growth on acetamide as sole nitrogen source. The expression plasmids for protease variants were transformed into Aspergillus as described in Lassen et al. (2001), Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 67, 4701-4707. For each of the constructs 10-20 strains were isolated, purified and cultivated in shake flasks. Purification of Expressed Variants 1. Adjust pH of the 0.22 μm filtered fermentation sample to 4.0. 2.

DNA corresponding to the Penicillium oxalicum glucoamylase gene was cloned into an Aspergillus expression vector linearized with BamHI and HindIII, using an IN-FUSION™ Dry-Down PCR Cloning Kit (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, Calif., USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The linearized vector construction is as described in WO 2005/042735 A1. A 2 μl volume of the ligation mixture was used to transform 25 μl of Fusion Blue E. coli cells (included in the IN-FUSION™ Dry-Down PCR Cloning Kit). After a heat shock at 42° C. for 45 sec, and chilling on ice, 250 μl of SOC medium was added, and the cells were incubated at 37° C. at 225 rpm for 90 min before being plated out on LB agar plates containing 50 μg of ampicillin per ml, and cultivated overnight at 37° C. Selected colonies were inoculated in 3 ml of LB medium supplemented with 50 μg of ampicillin per ml and incubated at 37° C. at 225 rpm overnight. Plasmid DNA from the selected colonies was purified using Mini JETSTAR (Genomed, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Penicillium oxalicum glucoamylase gene sequence was verified by Sanger sequencing before heterologous expression. One of the plasmids was selected for further expression, and was named XYZ XYZ1471-4. Protoplasts of Aspergillus niger MBin118 were prepared as described in WO 95/02043. One hundred μl of protoplast suspension were mixed with 2.5 μg of the XYZ1471-4 plasmid and 250 microliters of 60% PEG 4000 (Applichem) (polyethylene glycol, molecular weight 4,000), 10 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 were added and gently mixed. The mixture was incubated at 37° C. for 30 minutes and the protoplasts were mixed with 6% low melting agarose (Biowhittaker Molecular Applications) in COVE sucrose (Cove, 1996, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 133:51-56) (1M) plates supplemented with 10 mM acetamide and 15 mM CsCl and added as a top layer on COVE sucrose (1M) plates supplemented with 10 mM acetamide and 15 mM CsCl for transformants selection (4 ml topagar per plate). After incubation for 5 days at 37° C. spores of sixteen transformants were picked up and seed on 750 μl YP-2% Maltose medium in 96 deepwell MT plates. After 5 days of stationary cultivation at 30° C., 10 μl of the culture-broth from each well was analyzed on a SDS-PAGE (Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) gel, Griton XT Precast gel (BioRad, CA, USA) in order to identify the best transformants based on the ability to produce large amount of glucoamylase. A selected transformant was identified on the original transformation plate and was preserved as spores in a 20% glycerol stock and stored frozen (−80° C.). Cultivation. The selected transformant was inoculated in 100 ml of MLC media and cultivated at 30° C. for 2 days in 500 ml shake flasks on a rotary shaker. 3 ml of the culture broth was inoculated to 100 ml of M410 medium and cultivated at 30° C. for 3 days. The culture broth was centrifugated and the supernatant was filtrated using 0.2 μm membrane filters. Alpha-Cyclodextrin Affinity Gel. Ten grams of Epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St. Giles, U.K) powder was suspended in and washed with distilled water on a sintered glass filter. The gel was suspended in coupling solution (100 ml of 12.5 mg/ml alpha-cyclodextrin, 0.5 M NaOH) and incubated at room temperature for one day with gentle shaking. The gel was washed with distilled water on a sintered glass filter, suspended in 100 ml of 1 M ethanolamine, pH 10, and incubated at 50° C. for 4 hours for blocking. The gel was then washed several times using 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8 and 50 mM NaOAc, pH 4.0 alternatively. The gel was finally packed in a 35-40 ml column using equilibration buffer (50 mM NaOAc, 150 mM NaCl, pH 4.5). Purification of Glucoamylase from Culture Broth. Culture broth from fermentation of A. niger MBin118 harboring the glucoamylase gene was filtrated through a 0.22 μm PES filter, and applied on a alpha-cyclodextrin affinity gel column previously equilibrated in 50 mM NaOAc, 150 mM NaCl, pH 4.5 buffer. Unbound material was washed off the column with equilibration buffer and the glucoamylase was eluted using the same buffer containing 10 mM beta-cyclodextrin over 3 column volumes. The glucoamylase activity of the eluent was checked to see, if the glucoamylase had bound to the alpha-cyclodextrin affinity gel. The purified glucoamylase sample was then dialyzed against 20 mM NaOAc, pH 5.0. The purity was finally checked by SDS-PAGE, and only a single band was found.

The resulting purified two fragments were cloned into an Aspergillus expression vector linearized with BamHI and HindIII, using an IN-FUSION™ Dry-Down PCR Cloning Kit (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, Calif., USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The linearized vector construction is as described in WO 2005/042735 A1. The ligation mixture was used to transform E. coli DH5α cells (TOYOBO). Selected colonies were inoculated in 3 ml of LB medium supplemented with 50 μg of ampicillin per ml and incubated at 37° C. at 225 rpm overnight. Plasmid DNA from the selected colonies was purified using Qiagen plasmid mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sequence of Penicillium oxalicum glucoamylase site-directed variant gene sequence was verified before heterologous expression and one of the plasmids was selected for further expression, and was named pPoPE001. Protoplasts of Aspergillus niger MBin118 were prepared as described in WO 95/02043. One hundred μl of protoplast suspension were mixed with 2.5 μg of the pPoPE001 plasmid and 250 microliters of 60% PEG 4000 (Applichem) (polyethylene glycol, molecular weight 4,000), 10 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 were added and gently mixed. The mixture was incubated at 37° C. for 30 minutes and the protoplasts were mixed with 1% agarose L (Nippon Gene) in COVE sucrose (Cove, 1996, Biochim. Biophys. Acta 133:51-56) supplemented with 10 mM acetamide and 15 mM CsCl and added as a top layer on COVE sucrose plates supplemented with 10 mM acetamide and 15 mM CsCl for transformants selection (4 ml topagar per plate). After incubation for 5 days at 37° C. spores of sixteen transformants were picked up and seed on 750 μl YP-2% Maltose medium in 96 deepwell MT plates. After 5 days of stationary cultivation at 30° C., 10 μl of the culture-broth from each well was analyzed on a SDS-PAGE gel in order to identify the best transformants based on the ability to produce large amount of the glucoamylase. Example 9 Purification of Site-Directed Po AMG Variant PE001 The selected transformant of the variant and the strain expressing the wild type Penicillium oxalicum glucoamylase described in Example 6 was cultivated in 100 ml of YP-2% maltose medium and the culture was filtrated through a 0.22 μm PES filter, and applied on a alpha-cyclodextrin affinity gel column previously equilibrated in 50 mM NaOAc, 150 mM NaCl, pH 4.5 buffer. Unbound materials was washed off the column with equilibration buffer and the glucoamylase was eluted using the same buffer containing 10 mM beta-cyclodextrin over 3 column volumes. The glucoamylase activity of the eluent was checked to see, if the glucoamylase had bound to the alpha-cyclodextrin affinity gel. The purified glucoamylase samples were then dialyzed against 20 mM NaOAc, pH 5.0. Example 10 Characterization of PE001 Protease Stability 40 μl enzyme solutions (1 mg/ml) in 50 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, were mixed with 1/10 volume of 1 mg/ml protease solutions such as aspergillopepsin I described in Biochem J. 1975 April; 147(1):45-53, or the commercially available product from Sigma and aorsin described in Biochemical journal [0264-6021] Ichishima yr: 2003 vol: 371 iss: Pt 2 pg: 541 and incubated at 4 or 32° C. overnight. As a control experiment, H2O was added to the sample instead of proteases. The samples were loaded on SDS-PAGE to see if the glucoamylases are cleaved by proteases. In SDS-PAGE, PE001 only showed one band corresponding to the intact molecule, while the wild type glucoamylase was degraded by proteases and showed a band at lower molecular size at 60 kCa.

Example 12 Glucoamylase Activity of Variant Compared to Parent The glucoamylase activity measures as AGU as described above was checked for the purified enzymes of the wild type Penicillium oxalicum and the variant glucoamylase. The Glucoamylase Unit (AGU) was defined as the amount of enzyme, which hydrolyzes 1 micromole maltose per minute under the standard conditions (37° C., pH 4.3, substrate: maltose 100 mM, buffer: acetate 0.1 M, reaction time 6 minutes). TABLE 13 Relative specific activity AGU/mg Penicillium oxalicum wt 100% Penicillium oxalicum PE001 (SEQ ID NO: 14 + 102% K79V substitution) Example 13 Purification of Glucoamylase Variants Having Increased Thermostability The variants showing increased thermostability may be constructed and expressed similar to the procedure described in Example 8. All variants were derived from the PE001. After expression in YPM medium, variants comprising the T65A or Q327F substitution was micropurified as follows: Mycelium was removed by filtration through a 0.22 μm filter. 50 μl column material (alpha-cyclodextrin coupled to Mini-Leak divinylsulfone-activated agarose medium according to manufacturer's recommendations) was added to the wells of a filter plate (Whatman, Unifilter 800 μl, 25-30 μm MBPP). The column material was equilibrated with binding buffer (200 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5) by two times addition of 200 μl buffer, vigorous shaking for 10 min (Heidolph, Titramax 101, 1000 rpm) and removal of buffer by vacuum (Whatman, UniVac 3). Subsequently, 400 μl culture supernatant and 100 μl binding buffer was added and the plate incubated 30 min with vigorous shaking. Unbound material was removed by vacuum and the binding step was repeated. Normally 4 wells were used per variant. Three washing steps were then performed with 200 μl buffer of decreasing ionic strength added (50/10/5 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5), shaking for 15 min and removal of buffer by vacuum. Elution of the bound AMG was achieved by two times addition of 100 μl elution buffer (250 mM sodium acetate, 0.1% alpha-cyclodextrin, pH 6.0), shaking for 15 min and collection of eluted material in a microtiter plate by vacuum. Pooled eluates were concentrated and buffer changed to 50 mM sodium acetate pH 4.5 using centrifugal filter units with 10 kDa cut-off (Millipore Microcon Ultracel YM-10). Micropurified samples were stored at −18° C. until testing of thermostability. Example 14 Protein Thermal Unfolding Analysis (TSA, Thermal Shift Assay) Protein thermal unfolding of the T65A and Q327F variants, was monitored using Sypro Orange (In-vitrogen, S-6650) and was performed using a real-time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems; Step-One-Plus). In a 96-well plate, 25 microliter micropurified sample in 50 mM Acetate pH4.5 at approx. 100 microgram/ml was mixed (5:1) with Sypro Orange (resulting conc.=5×; stock solution from supplier=5000×). The plate was sealed with an optical PCR seal. The PCR instrument was set at a scan-rate of 76° C. pr. hr, starting at 25° C. and finishing at 96° C. Protein thermal unfolding of the E501V+Y504T variant, was monitored using Sypro Orange (In-vitrogen, S-6650) and was performed using a real-time PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems; Step-One-Plus). In a 96-well plate, 15 microliter purified sample in 50 mM Acetate pH4.5 at approx. 50 microgram/ml was mixed (1:1) with Sypro Orange (resulting conc.=5×; stock solution from supplier=5000×) with or without 200 ppm Acarbose (Sigma A8980). The plate was sealed with an optical PCR seal. The PCR instrument was set at a scan-rate of 76 degrees C. pr. hr, starting at 25° C. and finishing at 96° C. Fluorescence was monitored every 20 seconds using in-built LED blue light for excitation and ROX-filter (610 nm, emission). Tm-values were calculated as the maximum value of the first derivative (dF/dK) (ref.: Gregory et al; J Biomol Screen 2009 14: 700.) TABLE 14a Sample Tm (Deg.

The thermostability of the purified Po-AMG PE001 derived variants were determined at pH 4.0 or 4.8 (50 mM Sodium Acetate) by Differential Scanning calorimetry (DSC) using a VP-Capillary Differential Scanning calorimeter (MicroCal Inc., Piscataway, N.J., USA). The thermal denaturation temperature, Td (° C.), was taken as the top of the denaturation peak (major endothermic peak) in thermograms (Cp vs. T) obtained after heating enzyme solutions in selected buffers (50 mM Sodium Acetate, pH 4.0 or 4.8) at a constant programmed heating rate of 200 K/hr.

After the heat-shock the residual activity of the variant was measured as well as in a non-stressed sample. Description of Po-AMG pNPG Activity Assay: The Penicillium oxalicum glucoamylase pNPG activity assay is a spectrometric endpoint assay where the samples are split in two and measured thermo-stressed and non-thermo-stressed. The data output is therefore a measurement of residual activity in the stressed samples. Growth: A sterile micro titer plate (MTP) was added 200 μL rich growth media (FT X-14 without Dowfax) to each well. The strains of interest were inoculated in triplicates directly from frozen stocks to the MTP. Benchmark was inoculated in 20 wells. Non-inoculated wells with media were used as assay blanks. The MTP was placed in a plastic box containing wet tissue to prevent evaporation from the wells during incubation. The plastic box was placed at 34° C. for 4 days. Assay: 50 μL supernatant was transferred to 50 μL 0.5 M NaAc pH 4.8 to obtain correct sample pH. 50 μL dilution was transferred to a PCR plate and thermo-stressed at 83° C. for 5 minutes in a PCR machine. The remaining half of the dilution was kept at RT. 20 μL of both stressed and unstressed samples was transferred to a standard MTP. 20 μL pNPG-substrate was added to start the reaction. The plate was incubated at RT for 1 hour. The reaction was stopped and the colour developed by adding 50 μL 0.5M Na2CO3. The yellow colour was measured on a plate reader (Molecular Devices) at 405 nm. Buffers: 0.5 M NaAc pH 4.8 0.25 M NaAc pH 4.8 Substrate, 6 mM pNPG: 15 mg 4-nitrophenyl D-glucopyranoside in 10 mL 0.25 NaAc pH 4.8 STOP/developing solution: 0.5 M Na2CO3 Data Treatment: In Excel the raw Abs405 data from both stressed and unstressed samples were blank subtracted with their respective blanks. The residual activity (% res. act.=(Absunstressed−(Absunstressed−Absstressed))/Absunstressed*100%) was calculated and plotted relative to benchmark, Po-amg0008.
