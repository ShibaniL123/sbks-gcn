FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-inden-1-one, use of the compound as well as processes for preparation of the compound. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Deuterated 1-piperazino-3-phenyl-indanes for treatment of schizophrenia have been disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 13/527,364. U.S. application Ser. No. 13/527,364 also discloses how specific deuterated 1-piperazino-3-phenyl-indanes can be obtained via 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-indan-1-one. However, the disclosed routes for synthesis of both racemic and enantiomerically pure 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-indan-1-one rely on the uneconomical use of high loading of either a chiral rhodium catalyst or a chiral palladium catalyst. Accordingly, new processes for the synthesis of racemic and enantiomerically pure 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-indan-1-one are desirable, and are herein described proceeding via the compound 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-inden-1-one (I). Clark, W. M. et al in Organic Letter, 1999, Vol. 1, No. 11, pp. 1839-1842 attempted the preparation of 3-arylindenones, such as 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-indan-1-one (I), with electron-withdrawing groups (Cl, Br, NO2) at the C(5)- or C(6)-position of the indenone ring using a Suzuki methodology, but failed to obtain appreciable amounts of the desired products. In contrast, the present invention describes the successful preparation of such 3-arylindenones, e.g. 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-indan-1-one (I), via a Suzuki methodology. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention discloses the compound 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-inden-1-one (I) and routes of synthesis to obtain (I). In a further aspect the present invention discloses the use of 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-inden-1-one (I) to obtain racemic 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-indan-1-one (VIII) or (S)-6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-indan-1-one (IX). Further the present invention discloses use of 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-inden-1-one (I) to obtain 4-((1R,3S)-6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-indan-1-yl)-1(d3),2,2-trimethyl-piperazine and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.

Synthesis of 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-inden-1-one (I) A1. Via Suzuki Reaction (Scheme 3, Route A1) Synthesis of 3-bromo-6-chloro-inden-1-one (III) To a solution of 6-chloro-1-indanone (II) (100.0 g, 600.2 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (1.00 L) was added 2,2′-azo-bis-isobutyronitrile (9.86 g, 60.0 mmol) followed by N-bromosuccinimide (224.3 g, 1.26 mol). The reaction mixture was quickly heated to reflux. After 30 min at reflux, more 2,2′-azo-bis-isobutyronitrile (9.86 g, 60.0 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was kept for 4.5 h at reflux. Afterwards the mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The mixture was cooled to 0° C., and triethylamine (126 mL, 904 mmol) was added dropwise. The mixture was stirred for 1 h at 0° C., and then allowed to heat to room temperature. Water (1.0 L) was added. The mixture was vigorously stirred for 15 min. The stirring was stopped, and the aqueous layer was removed by suction. Fresh water (1.0 L) was added, and the mixture was stirred for 15 min. The aqueous layer was then separated by suction. The organic phase was further shaken with brine (500 mL) in a separating funnel. The organic layer was separated and stirred with MgSO4 and activated charcoal for 30 min. The mixture was filtered through a layer of Celite. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness in vacuo. This yielded crude 3-bromo-6-chloro-inden-1-one (III) (190 g) as a solid, which was used in the next step without further purification. Synthesis of 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-inden-1-one (I) To the crude 3-bromo-6-chloro-inden-1-one (III) from above was added palladium acetate (5.78 g, 25.8 mmol), triphenylphosphine (13.5 g, 51.5 mmol) and 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-d5-phenyl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolane (116 g, 566 mmol) followed by THF (1.50 L) at room temperature. Water (750 mL) and potassium phosphate (115 g, 541 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously for 2 h at room temperature. A dark almost black solution formed. Heptane (0.70 L) was added. The organic phase was then washed with water (1.0 L) and brine (0.5 L), dried over MgSO4, filtered and and evaporated to dryness in vacuo. This yielded crude 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-inden-1-one (I) as a dark solid. The crude 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-inden-1-one (I) was dissolved in a heptane-EtOAc (2:1) mixture and the solution was filtered through silica gel. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The residue was reprecipitated from heptane by dissolving in boiling heptane, filtering hot and allowing to cool slowly to room temperature to yield 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-inden-1-one (I) (75.8 g, 52%) as a dark orange solid, with a purity of 95% according to LC-MS analysis.

Via Oxidation (Scheme 3, Route A2) Example 1 Synthesis of 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-1H-indene (IV) To a suspension of magnesium (4.43 g, 182 mmol) in THF (15.0 mL) was added Red-Al (0.50 mL, 1.67 mmol, 65% w/w in toluene). A small amount (approximately 5 ml) of a solution of bromobenzene-d5 (29.3 g, 181 mmol) in THF (100 mL) was added at room temperature. The mixture was heated gently (40-50° C.) which gave initiation of the reaction. Initiation of the reaction was detected by an exotherm and the remaining solution of bromobenzene-d5 was added dropwise as to maintain a steady reflux, which took 35 min to complete. Afterwards the mixture was heated at reflux for 1.5 h. The resulting mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the solution was decanted (using cannula) from the excess magnesium. To the solution was added a solution of 5-chloro-1-indanone (V) (20.0 g, 120.0 mmol) in THF (100 mL) over a period of 30 min, which kept the temperature below 50° C. (no external heating or cooling). Upon completion of addition, the reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 1 h (no external heating or cooling). Concentrated sulfuric acid (13.3 mL, 96% w/w) was added very slowly and carefully while maintaining a temperature below 50° C. in the reaction mixture. Once the addition was finished, water (125 mL) was added. Most of the THF was removed by evaporation in vacuo. The remaining aqueous mixture was extracted with heptane twice (2×100 mL). The combined extracts were washed with saturated aq. NaHCO3-solution (100 mL), water (2×100 mL) and brine (100 mL). The organic phase was stirred vigorously with MgSO4 and activated charcoal for 20 min, and filtered through a layer of Celite. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness. The residue was co-evaporated with ethanol to dryness in vacuo to remove most heptane by azeotrop distillation. This yielded crude 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-1H-indene (IV) (26.7 g) as a solid. The crude product was reprecipitated from ethanol by dissolving in a minimum amount of boiling ethanol and cooling slowly to 5° C. with stirring to afford 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-1H-indene (IV) (20.5 g, 74%) as a yellowish solid, with a purity of 99% according to LC-MS analysis.

Example 1 To a solid mixture of (NBD)2RhBF4 (0.8 mg, 2 μmol) and (S)-Phanephos (3.5 mg, 6.1 μmol) was added EtOAc (oxygen-free, 4.0 mL). The mixture was stirred vigorously for 30 min, after which a solution of 6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-inden-1-one (I) (1.00 g, 4.07 mmol) in EtOAc (oxygen-free, 3.0 mL) was added to the foggy solution. The resulting mixture was hydrogenated at 4 bar hydrogen gas with stirring for 18 h. Analysis by chiral HPLC of the reaction mixture showed the formation of (S)-6-chloro-3-(phenyl-d5)-indan-1-one (IX) with 86% ee. The reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness in vacuo, and the residue was redissolved in minimum boiling ethanol, and the solution was allowed to cool slowly to room temperature.
