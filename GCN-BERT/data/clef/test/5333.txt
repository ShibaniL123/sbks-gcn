Synergistic compositions comprising a Bacillus subtilis strain and a biopesticide Description The present invention relates to mixtures comprising, as active components the Bacillus subtilis strain FB17, or a cell-free extract thereof or at least one metabolite thereof, and/or a mutant of Bacillus subtilis FB17 having all the identifying characteristics thereof or extract of the mutant and a biopesticide. Several plant-associated strains of the genus Bacillus described as belonging to the species Bacillus subtilis are used commercially as biopesticides or to promote the growth and improve the health of crop plants (Phytopathology 96, 145-154, 2006). Bacillus subtilis strain FB17 was originally isolated from red beet roots in North America (System Appl. Microbiol 27 (2004) 372-379, incorporated herein by reference). The strain was isolated from beet root on the basis of its ability to form surface biofilm and dendritic growth. This strain is known to be recruited by Arabidopsis roots by malic acid excretion (Plant Physiol. 148 (2008) 1547-1556). This Bacillus subtilis strain promotes plant health (US 2010/0260735 Α1, incorporated herein by reference), induces growth response and protection against pathogenic organisms and drought through colonization and biofilm formation on the Arabidopsis thaliana root surface (Planta 226 (2007) 283-297). It is also known to induce the production of grater biomass in a plant, to increase the drought tolerance of a plant, to induce a reduction of lignin concentration in a plant, to increase the iron concentration in a plant or to inhibit fungal infection in a plant (WO 2011/109395 Α2, incorporated herein by reference). Β. subtilis FB17 has also been deposited at American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA, USA, under accession number PTA-11857 on April 26, 2011. In the abovementioned publications, Bacillus subtilis strain FB17 may also be referred to as UD1022 or UD10-22. Biopesticides have been defined as a form of pesticides based on micro-organisms (bacteria, fungi, viruses, nematodes, etc.) or natural products (compounds, such as metabolites, proteins, or ectracts from biological or other natural sources) (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency: http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/biopesticides/). Biopesticides are typically created by growing and concentrating naturally occurring organisms and/or their metabolites including bacteria and other microbes, fungi, viruses, nematodes, proteins, etc. They are often considered to be important components of integrated pest management (IPM) programmes, and have received much practical attention as substitutes to synthetic chemical plant protection products (PPPs). Biopesticides fall into two major classes, microbial and biochemical pesticides: (1) Microbial pesticides consist of bacteria, fungi or viruses (and often include the metabolites that bacteria and fungi produce). Entomopathogenic nematodes are also classified as microbial pesticides, even though they are multi-cellular. (2) Biochemical pesticides are naturally occurring substances or structurally-similar and functionally identical to a naturally-occurring substance and extracts from biological sources that control pests or provide other crop protection uses as defined below, but have non-toxic mode of actions (such as growth or developmental regulation, attractents, repellents or defence activators (e.g. induced resistance) and are relatively non-toxic to mammals. Examples for biochemical pesticides include, but are not limited to semiochemicals (insect pheromones and kairomones), natural plant and insect regulators, naturally-occurring repellents and attractants, and proteins (e.g. enzymes). Biopesticides for use against crop diseases have already established themselves on a variety of crops. For example, biopesticides already play an important role in controlling downy mildew diseases. Their benefits include: a 0-Day Pre-Harvest Interval, the ability to use under moderate to severe disease pressure, and the ability to use in mixture or in a rotational program with other registered pesticides. A major growth area for biopesticides is in the area of seed treatments and soil amendments. Biopesticidal seed treatments are e.g. used to control soil borne fungal pathogens that cause seed rots, damping-off, root rot and seedling blights. They can also be used to control internal seed borne fungal pathogens as well as fungal pathogens that are on the surface of the seed. Many biopesticidal products also show capacities to stimulate plant host defenses and other physiological processes that can make treated crops more resistant to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses or can regulate plant growth. Many biopesticidal products also show capacities to stimulate plant health, plant growth and/or yield enhancing activity. The term "plant health" is to be understood to denote a condition of the plant and/or its products which is determined by several indicators alone or in combination with each other such as yield (℮. g. increased biomass and/or increased content of valuable ingredients), plant vigor (℮. g. improved plant growth and/or greener leaves ("greening effect")), quality (℮. g. improved content or composition of certain ingredients) and tolerance to abiotic and/or biotic stress.The above identified indicators for the health condition of a plant may be interdependent, or may result from each other. However, biopesticides under certain conditions can also have disadvantages such as high specificity: which may require an exact identification of the pest/pathogen and the use of multiple products to be used, slow speed of action (thus making them unsuitable if a pest outbreak is an immediate threat to a crop), variable efficacy due to the influences of various biotic and abiotic factors (since biopesticides are usually living organisms, which bring about pest/pathogen control by multiplying within the target insect pest/pathogen) and resistance development. Practical agricultural experience has shown that the repeated and exclusive application of an individual active component in the control of harmful fungi, insects or other pests leads in many cases to a rapid selection of those fungus strains or pest isolates which have developed natural or adapted resistance against the active component in question. Effective control of these fungi, insects or other pests with the active component in question is then no longer possible. To reduce the risk of the selection of resistant fungus strains or insect isolates, mixtures of different active components are nowadays conventionally employed for controlling harmful fungi or insects or other pests. By combining active compounds and/or biopesticides having different mechanisms of action, it is possible to ensure successful control over a relatively long period of time. Another typical problem arising in the field of pest control lies in the need to reduce the dosage rates of the active ingredient in order to reduce or avoid unfavorable environmental or toxicological effects whilst still allowing effective pest control. It is an object of the present invention overcome the abovementioned disadvantages and to provide, with a view to effective resistance management and effective control of phytopathogenic harmful fungi, insects or other pests or to effective plant growth regulation, at application rates which are as low as possible, compositions which, at a reduced total amount of active compounds applied, have improved activity against the harmful fungi or pests or improved plant growth regulating activity (synergistic mixtures) and a broadened activity spectrum, in particular for certain indications. One typical problem arising in the field of pest control lies in the need to reduce the dosage rates of the active ingredient in order to reduce or avoid unfavorable environmental or toxicological effects whilst still allowing effective pest control. In regard to the instant invention the term pests embrace animal pests, and harmful fungi. Another problem encountered concerns the need to have available pest control agents which are effective against a broad spectrum of pests, e.g. both animal pests and harmful fungi. There also exists the need for pest control agents that combine knock-down activity with prolonged control, that is, fast action with long lasting action. Another difficulty in relation to the use of pesticides is that the repeated and exclusive application of an individual pesticidal compound leads in many cases to a rapid selection of pests, that means animal pests, and harmful fungi, which have developed natural or adapted resistance against the active compound in question. Therefore there is a need for pest control agents that help prevent or overcome resistance. Another problem underlying the present invention is the desire for compositions that improve plants, a process which is commonly and hereinafter referred to as “ plant health” . This is particularly visible if application rates for the beforementioned mixtures of pesticides are used where the individual components show no or virtually no activity. The invention can also result in an advantageous behavior during formulation or during use, for example during grinding, sieving, emulsifying, dissolving or dispensing; improved storage stability and light stability, advantageous residue formation, improved toxicological or ecotoxicological behaviour, improved properties of the plant, for example better growth, increased harvest yields, a better developed root system, a larger leaf area, greener leaves, stronger shoots, less seed required, lower phytotoxicity, mobilization of the defense system of the plant, good compatibility with plants. Moreover, even an enhanced systemic action of S. subtilis FB17 and the biopesticides as defined herein and/or a persistency of the fungicidal, insecticidal, acaricidal and/or nematicidal action is expected. It was therefore also an object of the present invention to provide pesticidal mixtures which solve the problems of reducing the dosage rate and / or enhancing the spectrum of activity and / or combining knock-down activity with prolonged control and / or to resistance management and/or promoting (increasing) the health of plants. We have accordingly found that this object is achieved by the mixtures and compositions defined herein, comprising the Bacillus subtilis strain FB17, or a cell-free extract thereof or at least one metabolite thereof, and/or a mutant of Bacillus subtilis FB17 having all the identifying characteristics of respective Bacillus subtilis FB17 or extract of the mutant and a biopesticide.

Component 1) in the mixtures embraces not only the isolated, pure cultures of the Bacillus subtilis strain FB17 as defined herein, but also its cell-free extract, its suspensions in a whole broth culture or as a metabolite-containing supernatant or a purified metabolite obtained from a whole broth culture of the microorganism or microorganism strain. "Whole broth culture" refers to a liquid culture containing both cells and media. "Supernatant" refers to the liquid broth remaining when cells grown in broth are removed by centrifugation, filtration, sedimentation, or other means well known in the art. As used herein, the term "metabolite" refers to any component, compound, substance or byproduct (including but not limited to small molecule secondary metabolites, polyketides, fatty acid synthase products, non-ribosomal peptides, ribosomal peptides, proteins and enzymes) produced by a microorganism (such as fungi and bacteria, in particular the strains of the invention) that has any beneficial effect as described herein such as pesticidal activity or improvement of plant growth, water use efficiency of the plant, plant health, plant appearance, or the population of beneficial microorganisms in the soil around the plant activity herein. As used herein, "cell-free extract" refers to an extract of the vegetative cells, spores and/or the whole culture broth of a microorganism comprising cellular metabolites produced by the respective microorganism obtainable by cell disruption methods known in the art such as solventbased (℮. g. organic solvents such as alcohols sometimes in combination with suitable salts), temperature-based, application of shear forces, cell disruption with an ultrasonicator. The desired extract may be concentrated by conventional concentration techniques such as drying, evaporation, centrifugation or alike. Certain washing steps using organic solvents and/or water-based media may also be applied to the crude extract preferably prior to use. According to a further embodiment, component 1) embraces the Bacillus subtilis strain FB17, and a cell-free extract thereof. As used herein, "strain" refers to isolate or a group of isolates exhibiting phenotypic and/or genotypic traits belonging to the same lineage, distinct from those of other isolates or strains of the same species. As used herein, "isolate" refers to a pure microbial culture separated from its natural origin, such an isolate obtained by culturing a single microbial colony. An isolate is a pure culture derived from a heterogeneous, wild population of microorganisms. The term "mutant" refers a microorganism obtained by direct mutant selection but also includes microorganisms that have been further mutagenized or otherwise manipulated (e.g., via the introduction of a plasmid). Accordingly, embodiments include mutants, variants, and or derivatives of the respective microorganism, both naturally occurring and artificially induced mutants. For example, mutants may be induced by subjecting the microorganism to known mutagens, such as N-methyl-nitrosoguanidine, using conventional methods. Mutant strains may be obtained by any methods known in the art such as direct mutant selection, chemical mutagenesis or genetic manipulation (℮. g., via the introduction of a plasmid). For example, such mutants are obtainable by applying a known mutagen, such as X-ray, UV radiation or N-methyl-nitrosoguanidine. Subsequent to said treatments a screening for mutant strains showing the desired characteristics may be performed. Bacillus subtilis FB17 may be cultivated using media and fermentation techniques known in the art, e.g. in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) at 27°C for 24-72 hrs. The bacterial cells (vegatitive cells and spores) were washed and concentrated (e.g. by centrifugation at room temperature for 15 min at 7000 χ g). To produce a dry formulation, bacterial cells, preferably spores were suspended in a suitable dry carrier (e.g. clay). To produce a liquid formulation, cells, preferably spores, were re-suspended in a suitable liquid carrier (e.g. water-based) to the desired spore density. The spore density number of spores per ml_ was determined by identifying the number of heatresistant colony-forming units (70°C for 10 min) on Trypticase Soy Agar after incubation for 18-24 hrs at 37°C. Bacillus subtilis FB17 is generally active in temperatures between 7°C and 52°C (Holtmann, G. & Bremer, Ε. (2004), J. Bacteriol. 186, 1683- 1693). According to the invention, component 2) in the mixtures may not be Bacillus subtilis strain FB17. According to one embodiment, component 2) in the mixtures is at least one biopesticide from group E'). According to another embodiment, component 2) in the mixtures is at least one biopesticide from group E'), which belong to the group of rhizobia. Rhizobia are soil bacteria that fix nitrogen (diazotrophs) after becoming established inside root nodules of legumes (Fabaceae). Rhizobia require a plant host; they cannot independently fix nitrogen. In general, they are Gram-negative, motile, non-sporulating rods. For this application, rhizobia are understood to comprise the genera Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium, Mesorhizobium and Bradyrhizobium. Thus, according to another embodiment, component 2) in the mixtures is at least one biopesticide selected from Bradyrhizobium sρρ., Β. japonicum, Β. liaoningerise, Β. lupini, Mesorhizobium spp., Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. phaseoli, R. I. bv. trifolii, R. I. bv. viciae and Sinorhizobium melilotr, even more preferably from Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. phaseoli, R. I. bv. trifolii and R. I. bv. viciae. The biopesticides from group A') and/or B') may also have insecticidal, acaricidal, molluscidal, pheromone, nematicidal, plant stress reducing, plant growth regulator, plant growth promoting and/or yield enhancing activity. The biopesticides from group C') and/or D') may also have fungicidal, bactericidal, viricidal, plant defense activator, plant stress reducing, plant growth regulator, plant growth promoting and/or yield enhancing activity. The biopesticides from group E') and/or F') may also have fungicidal, bactericidal, viricidal, plant defense activator, insecticidal, acaricidal, molluscidal, pheromone and/or nematicidal activity. The biopesticides, their preparation and their biological activity e.g. against harmful fungi, pests is known (e-Pesticide Manual V 5.2 (ISBN 978 1 901396 85 0) (2008-2011); http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/biopesticides/, see product lists therein; http://www.omri.org/omrilists, see lists therein; Bio-Pesticides Database BPDB http://sitem.herts.ac.uk/aeru/bpdb/, see A to Ζ link therein).

The inventive mixtures comprising as biopesticide II a microbial pesticide from groups A'), C') and E') may be formulated as an inoculantfor a plant. The term "inoculant" means a preparation that includes an isolated culture of a microbial pesticide and optionally a carrier, which may include a biologically acceptable medium. The abovementioned microbial pesticides may be isolated or substantially purified. The terms "isolated" or "substantially purified" refers to microbial pesticides that have been removed from a natural environment and have been isolated or separated, and are at least 60% free, preferably at least 75% free, and more preferably at least 90% free, even more preferably at least 95% free, and most preferably at least 100% free from other components with which they were naturally associated. An "isolated culture" refers to a culture of the microbial pesticides that does not include significant amounts of other materials such as other materials which normally are found in natural habitat in which the microbial pesticides grows and/or from which the microbial pesticides normally may be obtained. An "isolated culture" may be a culture that does not include any other biological, microorganism, and/or bacterial species in quantities sufficient to interfere with the replication of the "isolated culture." Isolated cultures of microbial pesticides may be combined to prepare a mixed culture of microbial pesticides. Herein, microbial pesticides may be supplied in any physiological state such as active or dormant. Dormant microbial pesticides may be supplied for example frozen, dried, or lyophilized or partly desiccated (procedures to produce these partly desiccated organisms are given in W02008/002371) or in form of spores.

The mixtures and compositions according to the invention are suitable as fungicides. They are distinguished by an outstanding effectiveness against a broad spectrum of phytopathogenic fungi, including soil-borne fungi, which derive especially from the classes of the Plasmodiophoromycetes, Peronosporomycetes (syn. Oomycetes), Chytridiomycetes, Zygomycetes, Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes (syn. Fungi imperfecti). Some are systemically effective and they can be used in crop protection as foliar fungicides, fungicides for seed dressing and soil fungicides. Moreover, they are suitable for controlling harmful fungi, which inter alia occur in wood or roots of plants. The mixtures and compositions according to the invention are particularly important in the control of a multitude of phytopathogenic fungi on various cultivated plants, such as cereals, ℮. g. wheat, rye, barley, triticale, oats or rice; beet, ℮. g. sugar beet or fodder beet; fruits, such as pomes, stone fruits or soft fruits, ℮. g. apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries or gooseberries; leguminous plants, such as lentils, peas, alfalfa or soybeans; oil plants, such as rape, mustard, olives, sunflowers, coconut, cocoa beans, castor oil plants, oil palms, ground nuts or soybeans; cucurbits, such as squashes, cucumber or melons; fiber plants, such as cotton, flax, hemp or jute; citrus fruit, such as oranges, lemons, grapefruits or mandarins; vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, cucurbits or paprika; lauraceous plants, such as avocados, cinnamon or camphor; energy and raw material plants, such as corn, soybean, rape, sugar cane or oil palm; corn; tobacco; nuts; coffee; tea; bananas; vines (table grapes and grape juice grape vines); hop; turf; natural rubber plants or ornamental and forestry plants, such as flowers, shrubs, broad-leaved trees or evergreens, ℮. g. conifers; and on the plant propagation material, such as seeds, and the crop material of these plants.

The term "plant propagation material" is to be understood to denote all the generative parts of the plant such as seeds and vegetative plant material such as cuttings and tubers (℮. g. potatoes), which can be used for the multiplication of the plant. This includes seeds, roots, fruits, tubers, bulbs, rhizomes, shoots, sprouts and other parts of plants, including seedlings and young plants, which are to be transplanted after germination or after emergence from soil. These young plants may also be protected before transplantation by a total or partial treatment by immersion or pouring. Preferably, treatment of plant propagation materials with the inventive mixtures and compositions thereof, respectively, is used for controlling a multitude of fungi on cereals, such as wheat, rye, barley and oats; rice, corn, cotton and soybeans. The term "cultivated plants" is to be understood as including plants which have been modified by breeding, mutagenesis or genetic engineering including but not limiting to agricultural biotech products on the market or in development (cf. http://cera-gmc.org/, see GM crop database therein). Genetically modified plants are plants, which genetic material has been so modified by the use of recombinant DNA techniques that under natural circumstances cannot readily be obtained by cross breeding, mutations or natural recombination. Typically, one or more genes have been integrated into the genetic material of a genetically modified plant in order to improve certain properties of the plant. Such genetic modifications also include but are not limited to targeted post-transtional modification of protein(s), oligo- or polypeptides ℮. g. by glycosylation or polymer additions such as prenylated, acetylated or farnesylated moieties or PEG moieties.

In particular, the present invention relates to a method for protection of plant propagation material from pests, wherein the plant propagation material is treated with an effective amount of an inventive mixture. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a method for protection of plant propagation material from animal pests (insects, acarids or nematodes), wherein the plant propagation material are treated with an effective amount of an inventive mixture. In an equally preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a method for protection of plant propagation material from harmful fungi, wherein the plant propagation material is treated with an effective amount of an inventive mixture. In general, "pesticidally effective amount" means the amount of the inventive mixtures or of compositions comprising the mixtures needed to achieve an observable effect on growth, including the effects of necrosis, death, retardation, prevention, and removal, destruction, or otherwise diminishing the occurrence and activity of the target organism. The pesticidally effective amount can vary for the various mixtures / compositions used in the invention. A pesticidally effective amount of the mixtures / compositions will also vary according to the prevailing conditions such as desired pesticidal effect and duration, weather, target species, locus, mode of application, and the like. The term "plant health effective amount" denotes an amount of the inventive mixtures, which is sufficient for achieving plant health effects as defined herein below. More exemplary information about amounts, ways of application and suitable ratios to be used is given below. Anyway, the skilled artisan is well aware of the fact that such an amount can vary in a broad range and is dependent on various factors, e.g. the treated cultivated plant or material and the climatic conditions. Healthier plants are desirable since they result among others in better yields and/or a better quality of the plants or crops, specifically better quality of the harvested plant parts. Healthier plants also better resist to biotic and/or abiotic stress. A high resistance against biotic stresses in turn allows the person skilled in the art to reduce the quantity of pesticides applied and consequently to slow down the development of resistances against the respective pesticides. It was therefore an object of the present invention to provide a pesticidal composition which solves the problems outlined above, and which should, in particular, improve the health of plants, in particular the yield of plants. The term "health of a plant” or “ plant health” is defined as a condition of the plant and/or its products which is determined by several aspects alone or in combination with each other such as increased yield, plant vigor, quality of harvested plant parts and tolerance to abiotic and/or biotic stress. It has to be emphasized that the above mentioned effects of the inventive mixtures, i.e. enhanced health of the plant, are also present when the plant is not under biotic stress and in particular when the plant is not under pest pressure. For example, for seed treatment applications, it is evident that a plant suffering from fungal or insecticidal attack shows reduced germination and emergence leading to poorer plant or crop establishment and vigor, and consequently, to a reduced yield as compared to a plant propagation material which has been subjected to curative or preventive treatment against the relevant pest and which can grow without the damage caused by the biotic stress factor. However, the methods according to the invention lead to an enhanced plant health even in the absence of any biotic stress. This means that the positive effects of the mixtures of the invention cannot be explained just by the pesticidal activities of the compounds (I) and (II), but are based on further activity profiles. Accordingly, the application of the inventive mixtures can also be carried out in the absence of pest pressure. In an equally preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a method for improving the health of plants grown from said plant propagation material, wherein the plant propagation material is treated with an effective amount of an inventive mixture. The mixtures comprising Bacillus subtilis strain FB17, or a cell-free extract thereof or at least one metabolite thereof, and/or a mutant of Bacillus subtilis FB17 having all the identifying

In an equally preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a method for controlling animal pests (insects, acarids or nematodes), wherein the animal pests (insects, acarids or nematodes), their habitat, breeding grounds, their locus or the plants to be protected against animal pest (insects, acarids or nematodes) attack are treated with an effective amount of an inventive mixture comprising Β. subtilis FB17 and at least one biopesticide II. In general, "pesticidally effective amount" means the amount of the inventive mixtures or of compositions comprising the mixtures needed to achieve an observable effect on growth, including the effects of necrosis, death, retardation, prevention, and removal, destruction, or otherwise diminishing the occurrence and activity of the target organism. The pesticidally effective amount can vary for the various mixtures / compositions used in the invention. A pesticidally effective amount of the mixtures / compositions will also vary according to the prevailing conditions such as desired pesticidal effect and duration, weather, target species, locus, mode of application, and the like. In an equally preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a method for improving the health of plants, wherein the plants are treated with an effective amount of an inventive mixture. The term "plant health effective amount" denotes an amount of the inventive mixtures, which is sufficient for achieving plant health effects as defined herein below. More exemplary information about amounts, ways of application and suitable ratios to be used is given below. Anyway, the skilled artisan is well aware of the fact that such an amount can vary in a broad range and is dependent on various factors, e.g. the treated cultivated plant or material and the climatic conditions. Healthier plants are desirable since they result among others in better yields and/or a better quality of the plants or crops, specifically better quality of the harvested plant parts. Healthier plants also better resist to biotic and/or abiotic stress. A high resistance against biotic stresses in turn allows the person skilled in the art to reduce the quantity of pesticides applied and consequently to slow down the development of resistances against the respective pesticides. It was therefore an object of the present invention to provide a pesticidal composition which solves the problems outlined above, and which should, in particular, improve the health of plants, in particular the yield of plants. The term "health of a plant" or "plant health" is defined as a condition of the plant and/or its products which is determined by several aspects alone or in combination with each other such as increased yield, plant vigor, quality of harvested plant parts and tolerance to abiotic and/or biotic stress. It has to be emphasized that the above mentioned effects of the inventive mixtures, i.e. enhanced health of the plant, are also present when the plant is not under biotic stress and in particular when the plant is not under pest pressure. For seed treatment e.g. as inoculant and/or foliar application forms, it is evident that a plant suffering from fungal or insecticidal attack produces a smaller biomass and leads to a reduced yield as compared to a plant which has been subjected to curative or preventive treatment against the pathogenic fungus or any other relevant pest and which can grow without the damage caused by the biotic stress factor. However, the methods according to the invention lead to an enhanced plant health even in the absence of any biotic stress. This means that the positive effects of the mixtures of the invention cannot be explained just by the pesticidal activities of the compounds (I) and (II), but are based on further activity profiles. Accordingly, the application of the inventive mixtures can also be carried out in the absence of pest pressure. Each plant health indicator listed below, which is selected from the groups consisting of yield, plant vigor, quality and tolerance of the plant to abiotic and/or biotic stress, is to be understood as a preferred embodiment of the present invention either each on its own or preferably in combination with each other. According to the present invention, "increased yield" of a plant means that the yield of a product of the respective plant is increased by a measurable amount over the yield of the same product of the plant produced under the same conditions, but without the application of the inventive mixture. For seed treatment e.g. as inoculant and/or foliar application forms, increased yield can be characterized, among others, by the following improved properties of the plant: increased plant weight; and/or increased plant height; and/or increased biomass such as higher overall fresh weight (FW); and/or increased number of flowers per plant; and/or higher grain and/or fruit yield ; and/or more tillers or side shoots (branches); and/or larger leaves; and/or increased shoot growth; and/or increased protein content; and/or increased oil content; and/or increased starch content; and/or increased pigment content; and/or increased chlorophyll content (chlorophyll content has a positive correlation with the plant’ s photosynthesis rate and accordingly, the higher the chlorophyll content the higher the yield of a plant) and/or increased quality of a plant. "Grain" and "fruit" are to be understood as any plant product which is further utilized after harvesting, e.g. fruits in the proper sense, vegetables, nuts, grains, seeds, wood (e.g. in the case of silviculture plants), flowers (e.g. in the case of gardening plants, ornamentals) etc., that is anything of economic value that is produced by the plant. According to the present invention, the yield is increased by at least 4%. In general, the yield increase may even be higher, for example 5 to 10 %, more preferable by 10 to 20 %, or even 20 to 30 % According to the present invention, the yield - if measured in the absence of pest pressure is increased by at least 2 % In general, the yield increase may even be higher, for example until 4% to 5% or even more. Another indicator for the condition of the plant is the plant vigor. The plant vigor becomes manifest in several aspects such as the general visual appearance. For foliar applications, improved plant vigor can be characterized, among others, by the following improved properties of the plant: improved vitality of the plant; and/or improved plant growth; and/or improved plant development; and/or improved visual appearance; and/or improved plant stand (less plant verse/lodging and/or bigger leaf blade; and/or bigger size; and/or increased plant height; and/or increased tiller number; and/or increased number of side shoots; and/or increased number of flowers per plant; and/or increased shoot growth; and/or enhanced photosynthetic activity (e.g. based on increased stomatal conductance and/or increased C02 assimilation rate)); and/or earlier flowering; and/or earlier fruiting;; and/or earlier grain maturity; and/or less non-productive tillers; and/or less dead basal leaves; and/or less input needed (such as fertilizers or water); and/or greener leaves; and/or complete maturation under shortened vegetation periods; and/or easier harvesting; and/or faster and more uniform ripening; and/or longer shelf-life; and/or longer panicles; and/or delay of senescence ; and/or stronger and/or more productive tillers; and/or better extractability of ingredients; and/or improved quality of seeds (for being seeded in the following seasons for seed production); and/or reduced production of ethylene and/or the inhibition of its reception by the plant. Another indicator for the condition of the plant is the "quality" of a plant and/or its products. According to the present invention, enhanced quality means that certain plant characteristics such as the content or composition of certain ingredients are increased or improved by a measurable or noticeable amount over the same factor of the plant produced under the same conditions, but without the application of the mixtures of the present invention. Enhanced quality can be characterized, among others, by following improved properties of the plant or its product: increased nutrient content; and/or increased protein content; and/or increased oil content; and/or increased starch content; and/or increased content of fatty acids; and/or increased metabolite content; and/or increased carotenoid content; and/or increased sugar content; and/or increased amount of essential amino acids; and/or improved nutrient composition; and/or improved protein composition; and/or improved composition of fatty acids; and/or improved metabolite composition; and/or improved carotenoid composition; and/or improved sugar composition; and/or improved amino acids composition ; and/or improved or optimal fruit color; and/or improved leaf color; and/or higher storage capacity; and/or better processability of the harvested products. Another indicator for the condition of the plant is the plant's tolerance or resistance to biotic and/or abiotic stress factors. Biotic and abiotic stress, especially over longer terms, can have harmful effects on plants. Biotic stress is caused by living organisms while abiotic stress is caused for example by environmental extremes. According to the present invention, "enhanced tolerance or resistance to biotic and/or abiotic stress factors" means (1.) that certain negative factors caused by biotic and/or abiotic stress are diminished in a measurable or noticeable amount as compared to plants exposed to the same conditions, but without being treated with an inventive mixture and (2.) that the negative effects are not diminished by a direct action of the inventive mixture on the stress factors, e.g. by its fungicidal or insecticidal action which directly destroys the microorganisms or pests, but rather by a stimulation of the plants' own defensive reactions against said stress factors. Negative factors caused by biotic stress such as pathogens and pests are widely known and are caused by living organisms, such as competing plants (for example weeds), microorganisms (such as phythopathogenic fungi and/or bacteria) and/or viruses. Negative factors caused by abiotic stress are also well-known and can often be observed as reduced plant vigor (see above), for example: less yield and/or less vigor, for both effects examples can be burned leaves, less flowers, pre-mature ripening, later crop maturity, reduced nutritional value amongst others. Abiotic stress can be caused for example by: extremes in temperature such as heat or cold (heat stress / cold stress); and/or strong variations in temperature; and/or temperatures unusual for the specific season; and/or drought (drought stress); and/or extreme wetness; and/or high salinity (salt stress); and/or radiation (for example by increased UV radiation due to the decreasing ozone layer); and/or increased ozone levels (ozone stress); and/or organic pollution (for example by phythotoxic amounts of pesticides); and/or inorganic pollution (for example by heavy metal contaminants). As a result of biotic and/or abiotic stress factors, the quantity and the quality of the stressed plants decrease. As far as quality (as defined above) is concerned, reproductive development is usually severely affected with consequences on the crops which are important for fruits or seeds. Synthesis, accumulation and storage of proteins are mostly affected by temperature; growth is slowed by almost all types of stress; polysaccharide synthesis, both structural and storage is reduced or modified: these effects result in a decrease in biomass (yield) and in changes in the nutritional value of the product. As pointed out above, the above identified indicators for the health condition of a plant may be interdependent and may result from each other. For example, an increased resistance to biotic and/or abiotic stress may lead to a better plant vigor, e.g. to better and bigger crops, and thus to an increased yield. Inversely, a more developed root system may result in an increased resistance to biotic and/or abiotic stress. However, these interdependencies and interactions are neither all known nor fully understood and therefore the different indicators are described separately. In one embodiment the inventive mixtures effectuate an increased yield of a plant or its product. In another embodiment the inventive mixtures effectuate an increased vigor of a plant or its product. In another embodiment the inventive mixtures effectuate in an increased quality of a plant or its product. In yet another embodiment the inventive mixtures effectuate an increased tolerance and/or resistance of a plant or its product against biotic stress. In yet another embodiment the inventive mixtures effectuate an increased tolerance and/or resistance of a plant or its product against abiotic stress. The invention also relates to agrochemical compositions comprising an auxiliary and Bacillus subtilis strain FB17, or a cell-free extract thereof or at least one metabolite thereof, and/or a mutant of Bacillus subtilis FB17 having all the identifying characteristics thereof or extract of the mutant, and at least one biopesticide II according to the invention. An agrochemical composition comprises a fungicidally or insecticidally effective amount of Bacillus subtilis strain FB17, or a cell-free extract thereof or at least one metabolite thereof, and/or a mutant of Bacillus subtilis FB17 having all the identifying characteristics thereof or extract of the mutant, and at least one biopesticide II. The term "effective amount" denotes an amount of the composition or of Bacillus subtilis strain FB17, or a cell-free extract thereof or at least one metabolite thereof, and/or a mutant of Bacillus subtilis FB17 having all the identifying characteristics thereof or extract of the mutant, and at least one biopesticide II, which is sufficient for promoting plant health, controlling harmful fungi or harmful pests on cultivated plants or in the protection of materials and which does not result in a substantial damage to the treated plants or materials. Such an amount can vary in a broad range and is dependent on various factors, such as the fungal or pest species to be controlled, the treated cultivated plant or material, the climatic conditions. The Bacillus subtilis strain FB17, or a cell-free extract thereof or at least one metabolite thereof, and/or a mutant of Bacillus subtilis FB17 having all the identifying characteristics thereof or extract of the mutant, and at least one biopesticide II can be converted into customary types of agrochemical compositions, ℮. g. solutions, emulsions, suspensions, dusts, powders, pastes, granules, pressings, capsules, and mixtures thereof.

Examples for composition types and their preparation are: i) Water-soluble concentrates (SL, LS) 10-60 wt% of a compound I and 5-15 wt% wetting agent (e.g. alcohol alkoxylates) are dissolved in water and/or in a water-soluble solvent (e.g. alcohols) ad 100 wt%. The active substance dissolves upon dilution with water. ii) Dispersible concentrates (DC) 5-25 wt% of a compound I and 1-10 wt% dispersant (℮. g. polyvinylpyrrolidone) are dissolved in organic solvent (e.g. cyclohexanone) ad 100 wt%. Dilution with water gives a dispersion. iii) Emulsifiable concentrates (EC) 15-70 wt% of a compound I and 5-10 wt% emulsifiers (e.g. calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and castor oil ethoxylate) are dissolved in water-insoluble organic solvent (e.g. aromatic hydrocarbon) ad 100 wt%. Dilution with water gives an emulsion. iv) Emulsions (EW, ΕΟ, ES) 5-40 wt% of a compound I and 1-10 wt% emulsifiers (e.g. calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and castor oil ethoxylate) are dissolved in 20-40 wt% water-insoluble organic solvent (e.g. aromatic hydrocarbon). This mixture is introduced into water ad 100 wt% by means of an emulsifying machine and made into a homogeneous emulsion. Dilution with water gives an emulsion, ν) Suspensions (SC, OD, FS) In an agitated ball mill, 20-60 wt% of a compound I are comminuted with addition of 2-10 wt% dispersants and wetting agents (e.g. sodium lignosulfonate and alcohol ethoxylate), 0.1-2 wt% thickener (e.g. xanthan gum) and water ad 100 wt% to give a fine active substance suspension. Dilution with water gives a stable suspension of the active substance.

The wt% relate to the total CS composition. xi) Dustable powders (DP, DS) 1-10 wt% of a compound I are ground finely and mixed intimately with solid carrier (e.g. finely divided kaolin) ad 100 wt%. xii) Granules (GR, FG) 0.5-30 wt% of a compound I is ground finely and associated with solid carrier (e.g. silicate) ad 100 wt%. Granulation is achieved by extrusion, spray-drying or fluidized bed. xiii) Ultra-low volume liquids (UL) 1-50 wt% of a compound I are dissolved in organic solvent (e.g. aromatic hydrocarbon) ad 100 wt%.

The compositions types i) to xi) may optionally comprise further auxiliaries, such as 0.1-1 wt% bactericides, 5-15 wt% anti-freezing agents, 0.1-1 wt% anti-foaming agents, and 0.1-1 wt% colorants. Microbial pesticides comprising (entomopathogenic) nematodes can be mass prepared as for use as biopesticides using in vivo or in vitro methods (Shapiro-llan and Gaugler 2002). In vivo production (culture in live insect hosts) requires a low level of technology, has low startup costs, and resulting nematode quality is generally high, yet cost efficiency is low. The approach can be considered ideal for small markets. In vivo production may be improved through innovations in mechanization and streamlining. A novel alternative approach to in vivo methodology is production and application of nematodes in infected host cadavers; the cadavers (with nematodes developing inside) are distributed directly to the target site and pest suppression is subsequently achieved by the infective juveniles that emerge. In vitro solid culture, i.e., growing the nematodes on crumbled polyurethane foam, offers an intermediate level of technology and costs. In vitro liquid culture is the most cost- efficient production method but requires the largest startup capital. Liquid culture may be improved through progress in media development, nematode recovery, and bioreactor design. A variety of formulations have been developed to facilitate nematode storage and application including activated charcoal, alginate and polyacrylamide gels, baits, clay, paste, peat, polyurethane sponge, vermiculite, and water-dispersible granules. Depending on the formulation and nematode species, successful storage under refrigeration ranges from one to seven months. Optimum storage temperature for formulated nematodes varies according to species; generally, steinernematids tend to store best at 4-8 °C whereas heterorhabditids persist better at 10-15 °C. Nematodes are formulated and applied as infective juveniles, the only free-living and therefore environmentally tolerant stage. Infective juveniles range from 0.4 to 1.5 mm in length and can be observed with a hand lens or microscope after separation from formulation materials. Disturbed nematodes move actively, however sedentary ambusher species (e.g. Steinernema carpocapsae, S. scapterisci) in water soon revert to a characteristic "J"-shaped resting position. Low temperature or oxygen levels will inhibit movement of even active cruiser species (e.g., S. glaseri, Heterorhabditis bacteriophora). In short, lack of movement is not always a sign of mortality; nematodes may have to be stimulated (e.g., probes, acetic acid, gentle heat) to move before assessing viability. Good quality nematodes tend to possess high lipid levels that provide a dense appearance, whereas nearly transparent nematodes are often active but possess low powers of infection. Infective juveniles are compatible with most but not all agricultural chemicals under field conditions. Compatibility has been tested with well over 100 different chemical pesticides. Entomopathogenic nematodes are compatible (e.g., may be tank-mixed) with most chemical herbicides and fungicides as well as many insecticides (such as bacterial or fungal products) (Koppenhofer and Grewal, 2005). According to the invention, the solid material (dry matter) of the Quillay extract and the biopesticides (with the exception of oils such as Neem oil, Tagetes oil, etc.) are considered as active components (e.g. to be obtained after drying or evaporation of the extraction medium or the suspension medium in case of liquid formulations of the microbial pesticides). In accordance with the present invention, the weight ratios and percentages used herein for biological extract such as Quillay extract are based on the total weight of the dry content (solid material) of the respective extract(s). For microbial pesticides II selected from groups A'), C') and E') and for the Bacillus subtilis strain FB 17, weight ratios and/or percentages refer to the total weight of a preparation of the respective biopesticide II with at least 1 χ 106 CFU/g ("colony forming units per gram total weight"), preferably with at least 1 χ 108 CFU/g, even more preferably from 1 χ 108 to 1 χ 1012 CFU/g dry matter. Colony forming unit is measure of viable microbial cells, in particular fungal and bacterial cells. In addition, here CFU may also be understood as number of (juvenile) individual nematodes in case of (entomopathogenic) nematode biopesticides, such as Steinernema feltiae. In the binary mixtures and compositions according to the invention the weight ratio of the component 1) and the component 2) generally depends from the properties of the active components used, usually it is in the range of from 1:100 to 100:1, regularly in the range of from 1:50 to 50:1, preferably in the range of from 1:20 to 20:1, more preferably in the range of from 1:10 to 10:1, even more preferably in the range of from 1:4 to 4:1 and in particular in the range of from 1:2 to 2:1. According to further embodiments of the binary mixtures and compositions, the weight ratio of the component 1) and the component2) usually is in the range of from 100:1 to 1:1, regularly in the range of from 50:1 to 1:1, preferably in the range of from 20:1 to 1:1, more preferably in the range of from 10:1 to 1:1, even more preferably in the range of from 4:1 to 1:1 and in particular in the range of from 2:1 to 1:1. According to further embodiments of the binary mixtures and compositions, the weight ratio of the component 1) and the component 2) usually is in the range of from 1:1 to 1:100, regularly in the range of from 1:1 to 1:50, preferably in the range of from 1:1 to 1:20, more preferably in the range of from 1:1 to 1:10, even more preferably in the range of from 1:1 to 1:4 and in particular in the range of from 1:1 to 1:2. These ratios are suitable for inventive mixtures applied by seed treatment. Herein, microbial pesticides II selected from groups A'), C') and E') and the Bacillus subtilis strain FB 17 may be supplied in any physiological state such as active or dormant. Such dormant active component may be supplied for example frozen, dried, or lyophilized or partly desiccated (procedures to produce these partly desiccated organisms are given in WQ2008/002371) or in form of spores. Microbial pesticides II selected from groups A'), C') and E') and the Bacillus subtilis strain FB 17 used as organism in an active state can be delivered in a growth medium without any additional additives or materials or in combination with suitable nutrient mixtures. Bacillus subtilis FB17 is preferably delivered and formulated in a dormant stage, more preferably in form of spores. In the ternary mixtures, i.e. compositions according to the invention comprising the component 1) and component 2) and a compound III (component 3), the weight ratio of component 1) and component 2) depends from the properties of the active substances used, usually it is in the range of from 1:100 to 100:1, regularly in the range of from 1:50 to 50:1, preferably in the range of from 1:20 to 20:1, more preferably in the range of from 1:10 to 10:1 and in particular in the range of from 1:4 to 4:1, and the weight ratio of component 1) and component 3) usually it is in the range of from 1:100 to 100:1, regularly in the range of from 1:50 to 50:1, preferably in the range of from 1:20 to 20:1, more preferably in the range of from 1:10 to 10:1 and in particular in the range of from 1:4 to 4:1. Any further active components are, if desired, added in a ratio of from 20:1 to 1:20 to the component 1). In the mixtures and compositions, the compound ratios are advantageously chosen so as to produce a synergistic effect. The total weight ratios of compositions wherein component 2) is selected from groups A'), C'), or E') can be determined based on the total weight of the solid material (dry matter) of component 1) and using the amount of CFU of component 2) to calculate the total weight of component 2) with the following equation that 1 χ 109 CFU equals one gram of total weight of component 2). The agrochemical compositions generally are characterized in that they contain an effective quantity of the active components as defined above. Generally, they contain between 0.01 and 95%, preferably between 0.1 and 90%, and in particular between 0.5 and 75%, by weight of active components. According to one embodiment, the compositions, wherein component 2) is selected from groups A'), C') and E'), comprise between 0.01 and 90% (w/w) of dry matter (solid material) of component 1) and from 1 χ 105 CFU to 1 χ 1012 CFU of component 2) per gram total weight of the composition. According to another embodiment, the compositions, wherein component 2) is selected from groups A'), C') and E'), comprise between 5 and 70% (w/w) of dry matter (solid material) of component 1) and from 1 χ 106 CFU to 1 χ 1010 CFU of component 2) per gram total weight of the composition. According to another embodiment, the compositions, wherein component 2) is selected from groups A'), C') and E'), comprise between 25 and 70% (w/w) of dry matter (solid material) of component 1) and from 1 χ 107 CFU to 1 χ 109 CFU of component 2) per gram total weight of the composition. Solutions for seed treatment (LS), suspoemulsions (SE), flowable concentrates (FS), powders for dry treatment (DS), water-dispersible powders for slurry treatment (WS), water-soluble powders (SS), emulsions (ES), emulsifiable concentrates (EC) and gels (GF) are usually employed for the purposes of treatment of plant propagation materials, particularly seeds. Preferred examples of seed treatment formulation types or soil application for pre-mix compositions are ofWS, LS, ES, FS, WG or CS-type. The compositions in question give, after two-to-tenfold dilution, active components concentrations of from 0.01 to 60% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 40%, in the ready-to-use preparations. Application can be carried out before or during sowing. Methods for applying or treating Β. subtilis FB17 and biopesticide II and compositions thereof, respectively, on to plant propagation material, especially seeds include dressing, coating, pelleting, dusting, soaking and in-furrow application methods of the propagation material. Preferably, Β. subtilis FB17 and biopesticide II or the compositions thereof, respectively, are applied on to the plant propagation material by a method such that germination is not induced, ℮. g. by seed dressing, pelleting, coating and dusting. Typically, a pre-mix formulation for seed treatment application comprises 0.5 to 99.9 percent, especially 1 to 95 percent, of the desired ingredients, and 99.5 to 0.1 percent, especially 99 to 5 percent, of a solid or liquid adjuvant (including, for example, a solvent such as water), where the auxiliaries can be a surfactant in an amount of 0 to 50 percent, especially 0.5 to 40 percent, based on the pre-mix formulation. Whereas commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates (e.g., pre- mix composition (formulation)), the end user will normally employ dilute formulations (e.g., tank mix composition). Seed treatment methods for applying or treating inventive mixtures and compositions thereof to plant propagation material, especially seeds, are known in the art, and include dressing, coating, filmcoating, pelleting and soaking application methods of the propagation material. Such methods are also applicable to the combinations according to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, the inventive mixture is applied or treated on to the plant propagation material by a method such that the germination is not negatively impacted. Accordingly, examples of suitable methods for applying (or treating) a plant propagation material, such as a seed, is seed dressing, seed coating or seed pelleting and alike. It is preferred that the plant propagation material is a seed, seed piece (i.e. stalk) or seed bulb. Although it is believed that the present method can be applied to a seed in any physiological state, it is preferred that the seed be in a sufficiently durable state that it incurs no damage during the treatment process. Typically, the seed would be a seed that had been harvested from the field; removed from the plant; and separated from any cob, stalk, outer husk, and surrounding pulp or other non-seed plant material. The seed would preferably also be biologically stable to the extent that the treatment would cause no biological damage to the seed. It is believed that the treatment can be applied to the seed at any time between harvest of the seed and sowing of the seed or during the sowing process (seed directed applications). The seed may also be primed either before or after the treatment. Even distribution of the ingredients in inventive mixtures and adherence thereof to the seeds is desired during propagation material treatment. Treatment could vary from a thin film (dressing) of the formulation containing the combination, for example, a mixture of active ingredient(s), on a plant propagation material, such as a seed, where the original size and/or shape are recognizable to an intermediary state (such as a coating) and then to a thicker film (such as pelleting with many layers of different materials (such as carriers, for example, clays; different formulations, such as of other active ingredients; polymers; and colourants) where the original shape and/or size of the seed is no longer recognizable. An aspect of the present invention includes application of the inventive mixtures onto the plant propagation material in a targeted fashion, including positioning the ingredients in the combination onto the entire plant propagation material or on only parts thereof, including on only a single side or a portion of a single side. One of ordinary skill in the art would understand these application methods from the description provided in ΕΡ 954213 Β1 and WO 06/112700. The inventive mixtures can also be used in form of a "pill" or “ pellet” or a suitable substrate and placing, or sowing, the treated pill, or substrate, next to a plant propagation material. Such techniques are known in the art, particularly in ΕΡ 1124414, WO 07/67042, and WO 07/67044. Application of the combinations described herein onto plant propagation material also includes protecting the plant propagation material treated with the combination of the present invention by placing one or more pesticide-containing particles next to a pesticide-treated seed, wherein the amount of pesticide is such that the pesticide-treated seed and the pesticide-containing particles together contain an Effective Dose of the pesticide and the pesticide dose contained in the pesticide-treated seed is less than or equal to the Maximal Non-Phytotoxic Dose of the pesticide. Such techniques are known in the art, particularly in WO 2005/120226. Application of the combinations onto the seed also includes controlled release coatings on the seeds, wherein the ingredients of the combinations are incorporated into materials that release the ingredients over time. Examples of controlled release seed treatment technologies are generally known in the art and include polymer films, waxes, or other seed coatings, wherein the ingredients may be incorporated into the controlled release material or applied between layers of materials, or both. Seed can be treated by applying thereto the compound s present in the inventive mixtures in any desired sequence or simultaneously. The seed treatment occurs to an unsown seed, and the term "unsown seed" is meant to include seed at any period between the harvest of the seed and the sowing of the seed in the ground for the purpose of germination and growth of the plant. Treatment to an unsown seed is not meant to include those practices in which the active ingredient is applied to the soil but would include any application practice that would target the seed during the planting process. Preferably, the treatment occurs before sowing of the seed so that the sown seed has been pre-treated with the combination. In particular, seed coating or seed pelleting are preferred in the treatment of the combinations according to the invention. As a result of the treatment, the ingredients in each combination are adhered on to the seed and therefore available for pest control. The treated seeds can be stored, handled, sowed and tilled in the same manner as any other active ingredient treated seed. When employed in plant protection, the total amounts of active components applied are, depending on the kind of effect desired, from 0.001 to 10 kg per ha, preferably from 0.005 to 2 kg per ha, more preferably from 0.05 to 0.9 kg per ha, in particular from 0.1 to 0.75 kg per ha. In the case of Bacillus strain FB 17 and microbial pesticides II, the application rates preferably range from about 1 χ 106 to 5 χ 1015 (or more) CFU/ha. Preferably, the spore concentration is about 1 χ 107 to about 1 χ 1011 CFU/ha. In the case of (entomopathogenic) nematodes as microbial pesticides (e.g. Steinernema feltiae), the application rates preferably range inform about 1 χ 105 to 1 χ 1012 (or more), more preferably from 1 χ 108 to 1 χ 1011, even more preferably from 5 χ 108 to 1 χ 1010 individuals (e.g. in the form of eggs, juvenile or any other live stages, preferably in an infetive juvenile stage) per ha. When employed in plant protection by seed treatment, the amount of the inventive mixtures (based on total weight of active components) is in the range from 0.01-10 kg, preferably from 0.1-1000 g, more preferably from 1-100 g per 100 kilogram of plant propagation material (preferably seeds). In the case of Bacillus subtilis FB17 and microbial pesticides II, the application rates with respect to plant propagation material preferably range from about 1 χ 106 to 1 χ 1012 (or more) CFU/seed. Preferably, the concentration is about 1 χ 106 to about 1 χ 1011 CFU/seed. In the case of Bacillus subtilis FB17 and microbial pesticides II, the application rates with respect to plant propagation material also preferably range from about 1 χ 107 to 1 χ 1014 (or more) CFU per 100 kg of seed, preferably from 1 χ 109 to about 1 χ 1011 CFU per 100 kg of seed. When used in the protection of materials or stored products, the amount of active components applied depends on the kind of application area and on the desired effect. Amounts customarily applied in the protection of materials are 0.001 g to 2 kg, preferably 0.005 g to 1 kg, of active components per cubic meter of treated material. Various types of oils, wetters, adjuvants, fertilizer, or micronutrients, and further pesticides (e.g. herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, growth regulators, safeners) may be added to the mictures or the compositions comprising them as premix or, if appropriate not until immediately prior to use (tank mix). These agents can be admixed with the compositions according to the invention in a weight ratio of 1:100 to 100:1, preferably 1:10 to 10:1. These further useful active compounds can be fertilizers or micronutrient donors (such as Mo, Ζη and / or Co), especially when applied to plant propagation materials. According to one embodiment, a polyether polymethylsiloxane copolymer may be added to the composition accoding to the invention, preferably in a weight ratio of 1:100 to 100:1, more preferably in a weight ratio of 1:10 to 10:1, in particular in a weight ratio of 1:5 to 5:1 based on the total weight of the component 1) and the component 2). According to a further embodiment, a mineral oil or a vegetable oil may be added to the composition according to the invention, preferably in a weight ratio of 1:100 to 100:1, more preferably in a weight ratio of 1:10 to 10:1, in particular in a weight ratio of 1:5 to 5:1 based on the total weight of the dry content of Bacillus subtilis strain FB17, or a cell-free extract thereof or at least one metabolite thereof, and/or a mutant of Bacillus subtilis FB17 having all the identifying characteristics thereof or extract of the mutant, and at least one biopesticide II together. The user applies the composition according to the invention usually from a predosage device, a knapsack sprayer, a spray tank, a spray plane, or an irrigation system. Usually, the agrochemical composition is made up with water, buffer, and/or further auxiliaries to the desired application concentration and the ready-to-use spray liquor or the agrochemical composition according to the invention is thus obtained. Usually, 20 to 2000 liters, preferably 50 to 400 liters, of the ready-to-use spray liquor are applied per hectare of agricultural useful area. According to one embodiment, individual components of the composition according to the invention such as parts of a kit or parts of a binary or ternary mixture may be mixed by the user himself in a spray tank and further auxiliaries may be added, if appropriate. The term "synergstic effect" is understood to refer in particular to that defined by Colby's formula (Colby, S. R., "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations", Weeds, 15, ρρ. 20-22, 1967). The term "synergistic effect" is also understood to refer to that defined by application of the Tammes method, (Tammes, Ρ. Μ. L., "Isoboles, a graphic representation of synergism in pesticides", Netherl. J. Plant Pathol. 70, 1964). The fungicidal action of the mixtures according to the invention can be shown by the tests described below. A) Microtiter plate tests If applicable, the chemical pesticides were formulated separately as a stock solution having a concentration of 10000 ppm in dimethyl sulfoxide. The stock solutions of the chemical pesticides were mixed according to the ratio, diluted to the stated concentrations and pipetted onto a filter micro titer plate (ΜΤΡ). A spore suspension of the pathogen (e.g. Botrytis cinerea, Septoria tritici, etc.) in e.g. aqueous biomalt solution was added as well as different concentrations of spores or cells of the respective biopesticide II and/or Bacillus subtilis FB17. The plates were incubated at optimal temperature depending on the pathogen and further processed 1-7 days after incubation. The supernatant was removed using CaptiVac Vacuum Collar and a vacuum filter pump. The remaining cell pellet was resolved in water and DNA was extracted. The growth of the pathogen was quantified via quantitative Real Time PCR using species- or strain-specific primers. To assess synergistic effects growth of the fungal pathogens was calculated in comparison to the different controls containing either the chemical pesticide or the microbial pesticide alone. The measured parameters were compared to the growth of the active component-free control variant (100%) and the fungus-free and active compound-free blank value to determine the relative growth in % of the pathogens in the respective active compounds. The expected efficacies of active compound combinations were determined using Colby's formula (Colby, S.R., Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations, Weeds, 15, ρρ. 20-22, 1967) and compared with the observed efficacies. Colby's formula: E = x + y-x* y/100 Ε expected efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using the mixture of the active component A (Β. subtilis FB17) and Β (e.g. biopesticide II) at the concentrations a and b χ efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using the active component A at the concentration a y efficacy, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using the active component Β at the concentration b. Use example FM-1: Activity against Septoria tritici, the causal agent of leaf blotch on wheat A spore suspension of Septoria tritici in an aqueous biomalt solution was used. The plates were placed in a water vapor-saturated chamber at a temperature of 18°C. Β) Greenhouse tests If applicable, the chemical pesticides (e.g. compounds III) were formulated separately or together as a stock solution comprising 25 mg of active substance which was made up to 10 ml using a mixture of acetone and/or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and the emulsifier Wettol EM 31 (wetting agent having emulsifying and dispersing action based on ethoxylated alkylphenols) in a volume ratio of solvent/emulsifier of 99 to 1. This solution was then made up to 100 ml using water. This stock solution was diluted with the solvent/emulsifier/water mixture described to the active substance concentration given below. The microbial pesticides (e.g. biopesticide II and Β. subtilis FB17) were cultivated as described herein and was diluted with water to the concentration given below. Use example FG-1: Activity against early blight on tomatoes caused by Phytophthora infestans with protective application Young seedlings of tomato plants were grown in pots. The plants were sprayed to runoff with an aqueous suspension containing the concentration of chemical pesticide stated below. Simultaneously or up to 6 hours later, the plants were sprayed with an aquous suspension containing the concentration of the microbial pesticide (e.g. biopesticide II and/or Β. subtilis FB17) stated below. The next day, the treated plants were inoculated with an aqueous suspension of sporangia of Phytophthora infestans. After inoculation, the trial plants were immediately transferred to a humid chamber. After 6 days at 18 to 20°C and a relative humidity close to 100%, the extent of fungal attack on the leaves was visually assessed as % diseased leaf area. The plant health effect of the compositions according to the invention can be shown by the experiment described below. Use example H-1: Action against drought stress Drought stress tolerance can be tested e.g. on duckweed plants grown in 24-well microplates according to the method disclosed J. Plant Growth Regul. 30, 504-511 (2011). The measured parameters were compared to the growth of the active compound-free control variant under drought stress (e.g. PEG treatment) (0%) and the active compound-free blank value without drought stress (e.g. PEG-fee) (100%) to determine the relative growth in % in the respective active compounds. The expected efficacies of active compound combinations were determined using Colby's formula as described above. Use example Η-2: Action to improve yield In field trials in Canada , Bacillus subtilis FB17 was tested in lentils for plant health effects as solo product and in combination with a rhizobial strain Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. viciae Ρ1 NP3Cst (also referred to as strain 1435). The Canadian lentil trials were executed in 2013 at Asquith (SK), Saskatoon (SK), Pike Lake (SK), Grandora (SK), Lethbridge (ΑΒ), Medicine Hat (ΑΒ), as a randomized block design in plots with a size of 10.5 m2 (1.5 m χ 7 m) using normal trial equipment for field trials. The used variety is cultivar CDC Maxim pre-treated with a standard chemical seed treatment and for each treatment 6 replications were made. On about September 5th, or thereabouts, the trials were harvested and the grain yield was measured in bushels per acre as an indicator for the plant health effect. In the seed dressing application, R. leguminosarum bv. viciae was applied as commercial product either as Nodulator XL Liquid (about 7.5 χ108 viable cells per ml; BASF Agricultural Specialties Ltd., Canada) at 7.5 litres per 100 bushels of seeds. Bacillus subtilis FB17 was applied as SC formulation to achieve 2.2x105 cfu/seed (44mL/100kg seed). The application of the different products was done as a seed treatment (seed and product treated in a Ziploc bag) prior to planter box seeding. The seeds were treated by members of the field research group AgQuest Inc. (Minto, Manitoba) for studies conducted in Saskatchewan, and by Farming Smarter (Lethbridge, Alberta) for studies conducted in Alberta. The measured yield was normalized on the basis of the control treatment (check) set to 100% resulting in relative yield. The relative yield difference was determined by subtracting relative yield of the control treatment (check). The expected relative yield differences of active component combinations were determined using Colby's formula (Colby, S.R. "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic responses of herbicide combinations", Weeds 15, ρρ. 20-22, 1967) and compared with the observed yield. Colby's formula: Ecoiby = Ρα+ Ρβ - Pa * Pb/100 Εcoiby expected yield difference, expressed in % of the untreated control, when using the mixture of the active compounds A and Β at the concentrations a and b Pa yield difference, expressed in % of the untreated control (0 %), when using the active compound A at the concentration a Ρβ yield dfference, expressed in % of the untreated control (0%), when using the active compound Β at the concentration b.
