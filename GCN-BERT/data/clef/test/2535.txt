Example 24-2 : Preparation of 2'-amino-6-(2-amino-6-methylpyrimidin-4-yl)-3'-fluoro-[2,4'-bipyridin]-5-ol (LXXI)
6-(2-Amino-6-methylpyrimidin-4-yl)-3'-fluoro-5-methoxy-[2,4'-bipyridin]-2'-amine (LXX) (1.94 g, 5.94 mmol) was mixed with pyridine hydrochloride (Pyridine HCl) (10 g) and the mixture was stirred at 170 Â°C for 1 hr. The mixture was cooled to room temperature, neutralized with 6N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution. The resulting solid was filtered and dried to give the title compound (1.67 g, 90 %).
