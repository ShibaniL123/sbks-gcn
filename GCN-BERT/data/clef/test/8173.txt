Step 3: N-cyclopropyl-3-nitro-4-(thiophen-3-yl)benzamide
To a solution of 3-nitro-4-(thiophen-3-yl)benzoic acid (416.0 mg, 1.67 mmol), 2-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (1.27 g, 3.34 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (0.86 g, 6.68 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (25 mL) was added cyclopropylamine (190.7 mg, 3.34 mmol). The reaction mixture was reacted for 3 hours at a temperature of 50 °C, and then cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was poured into water, and extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL×2). The organic phase was combined, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. Ethyl acetate was removed by rotary evaporation of the organic phase, and the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel to afford N-cyclopropyl-3-nitro-4-(thiophen-3-yl)benzamide (425.7 mg, yield 88.5%).
