CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/947,694, filed Mar. 4, 2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable PARTIES TO A JOINT RESEARCH AGREEMENT Not Applicable REFERENCE TO SEQUENCE LISTING, A TABLE, OR A COMPUTER PROGRAM LISTING COMPACT DISK APPENDIX Not Applicable BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention relates generally to aquarium equipment and accessories, and in particular to a universal aquarium hose cleaner. Aquarium owners often find the chore of cleaning out the aquarium and related equipment to be tiresome. One of the items of equipment that is usually neglected is the hose leading from the aquarium to the external filter. Unfiltered water is constantly pumped through the hose every day, leaving a dirty residue which accumulates, and eventually may cause pump failure. If the hose can be kept clean, it will improve water flow and may extend the service life of the pump. A universal aquarium hose cleaner, with an elongated cylindrical brush attached to the end of a semi-rigid cable or rigid wire, would resolve this problem. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the invention is directed to a universal aquarium hose cleaner. An elongated cylindrical brush is affixed to the end of a semi-rigid cable or rigid wire, enabling the user to push the brush through the hose while twisting it to clean the interior surface of the hose. The wire or cable is coated with plastic to prevent corrosion. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING The accompanying drawing is included to provide a further understanding of the invention and is incorporated into and constitutes a part of the specification. It illustrate one embodiment of the invention and, together with the description, serves to explain the principles of the invention. The FIGURE is a side view of the first exemplary embodiment, displaying the brush 10, the wire 11, the wire first end 11A, the wire second end 11B, the handle 12, and the axial line Al. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Referring now to the invention in more detail, the invention is directed to a universal aquarium hose cleaner. An elongated cylindrical brush 10 is affixed to the end of a semi-rigid cable or rigid wire 11, enabling the user to push the brush 10 through the hose while twisting it to clean the interior surface of the hose. The cable or wire 11 is coated with plastic to prevent corrosion. The invention is preferably capable of being used on any hose, for example, up to eight feet in length and one inch in diameter. The first exemplary embodiment comprises an elongated rigid wire 11, preferably eight feet long, having a first end 11A with a handle 12 affixed thereto and a second end 11B having an elongated cylindrical brush 10, preferably one and one-quarter inches in diameter. The cylindrical brush 10 is preferably composed of equally spaced rings of bristles of equal radius, and not a spiral configuration. The handle 12 is preferably an elongated elliptical loop and preferably lacks brush bristles. The rigid wire is centered about axial line A1, which further is collinear withpp the major axis of the handle 12. The second exemplary embodiment is virtually identical to the first exemplary embodiment, except that the rigid wire 11 is replaced by a semi-rigid cable. Alternate embodiments, featuring cables or wires 11 of different lengths and gauges, and brushes 10 of different lengths and diameters, are also contemplated. Both of the exemplary embodiments may include brushes 10 of various lengths and diameters which are detachable and interchangeable. It is to be understood that while the first and second exemplary embodiments are intended for use with an aquarium hose, this is not intended to be a limiting factor. The invention, manufactured in various sizes and lengths, may be used on any hose or pipe which must be cleaned out. To use the first exemplary embodiment, the user must insert the brush 10 into one end of the hose, then hold the hose firmly with one hand, and the handle 12 with the other, and push the brush 10 through the hose to the other end using the handle 12, while twisting the handle 12. The user then rinses off the brush 10 and pulls the handle 12 to remove the device from the hose. To use the second exemplary embodiment, the user must insert the brush 10 into one end of the hose, then hold the hose firmly with one hand, and the cable with the other, and gradually push the brush 10 through the hose to the other end using the cable, while twisting the handle 12. The user then rinses off the brush 10 and pulls the handle 12 while twisting to thoroughly clean the hose and remove the device from the hose. The user then rinses off the brush 10 and the cable. The brush 10 is preferably manufactured from a durable, flexible material, such as nylon, plastic, or natural bristles. The wire 11 is preferably manufactured from a rigid, durable material such as steel, aluminum alloy, or high-impact plastic. The cable is preferably manufactured from a semi-rigid, durable material such as a cable manufactured from steel or aluminum alloy. The handle 12 is preferably manufactured from a rigid, durable material such as steel, aluminum alloy, wood, or plastic. To prevent corrosion, all metal parts are preferably coated with a durable, waterproof material such as plastic or silicone. Components, component sizes, and materials listed above are preferable, but artisans will recognize that alternate components and materials could be selected without altering the scope of the invention. While the foregoing written description of the invention enables one of ordinary skill to make and use what is presently considered to be the best mode thereof, those of ordinary skill in the art will understand and appreciate the existence of variations, combinations, and equivalents of the specific embodiment, method, and examples herein. The invention should, therefore, not be limited by the above described embodiment, method, and examples, but by all embodiments and methods within the scope and spirit of the invention. 1.
