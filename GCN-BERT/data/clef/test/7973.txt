rD I The present invention relates to complexes of saceharide-containing compounds with cycloamyloses, their preparation and their use. In particular the invention is concerned with complexes of pharmacological interest. Inclusion complexes of compounds with cycloamyloses, in particular cyclodextrins, are well known. Cyclodextrins are cyclic molecules consisting of 5,7, or 8 glucopyranose units linked as !5-1,4-glucoside units. Structurally they are characterised by a special arrangement of hydroxyl groups whereby the outer surface of the ring formed by the cyclodextrin is hydrophilic, ensuring water solubility, whilst the inner surface is li pophilic permitting molecules (known as guest molecules) or parts thereof which are less polar than water and are of suitable dimensions fo penetrate the lipophilic cavity in aqueous solution. A difficulty well recognised in the field of pharmaceuticals is that associated with poor aqueous solubility which may make formulations more difficult to prepare or cause other problemssuch as dissolution difficulties and hence poor or variable bioavailabil!ty. This is particu]arly so with compounds which have a very low aqueous solubility. Comp]exing with cyc]odextrins has been employed to overcome these problems but it is not invariably effective, One class of pharmaceuticals which have poor solubility in water are the cardiac glycosides of which the most notable is dioxin. It is generally recognised that drugs having a solubility in water aL 57°C of less than 1% w/v are particularly prone to bioavai]abi]ity problems, The solubility of digcxin is in the order of 0.005% in water and the question of bioavai]ability of compounds such as cardiac glycosides ìs particularly pertinent as they have a very low therapeutic index. C,B/em/17. 2.81 I 22,F42 A636 It has now been found9 contrary to expectations that complexes of the cardiac glycosides with cyc]odextrins can be formed that such complexes enhance the aqueous solubilíty of the cardiac glycosides and that the increase in solubility is much greater degree than could have been expected. The suprísingly high increase in solubility is sufficient to ameliorate the problems associated with poor solubility and in favourable circumstances increases the solubility to more than 1% w/v. We have also found that the complex does not adversely affect the absorption of the drug on administration. Although inclusion complexes of compounds with cyclodextrins in which the guest molecule is a compound having useful pharmacological properties have been described no complexes in which the guest molecule has the type of structure associated with cardiac glycosides are known. Further although inclusion complexes have been described as increasing the aqueous solubility of poorly soluble compounds the degree of increase observed (a maximum of from about 5 to 10 fold) is much lower than that found for cardiac glycosides and would be insufficient to overcome the problems associated with the poor solubility of the cardiac glycosides. The present invention accordingly provides an inclusion complex of a cardiac glycoside with a cyclodextrin. The cyclodextrin may comprise one or more of -cyclodextrin -cyclodextrin andré-cyclodextrin. Preferably the cyclodextrin is -cyclodextrin. By cardiac glycoside is meant a compound bearing one or more glycoside residues and which exhibit a pharmacological effect on heart function. Such cardiac glycosides include for example those compounds identified as such in Martingale The Extra Pharmacopoiea (26th Edition) page 617 et seq. Specific cardiac glycosides suitable for complexing with cyclodextrins include digitaline gitoxin diginin» deslanosìde lanatosides A B and C, and, ,, CLB/em/17.12.81 1ZZ 742 3 A636 preferably, digoxin. Conveniently the cardiac glycoside oligosaccharide side chain comprises at least three monosaccharide residues. The complexes of the invention may be prepared by any method known in the art for the preparation of complexes of cyclodextríns. Such methods involve, in general9 the mixing of a solution of the cardiac glycoside with an aqueous solution of the cyclodextrìn and isolating the so formed product. The cardiac glycoside may be dissolved in water or an organic solvent (either mìscible or immiscible with water). Convenient solvents include for example diethylether, tetrahydrofuran dioxan, acetone, dimethylsulphoxide, dimethylformamide and lower aliphatic alcohols. Preferably the cardiac glycoside is dissolved in either water or a mixture of water and a water-miscible solvent such as methanol or ethanol. The complex may be isolated by any suitable technique for example lyophilisation or evaporatìon of the solvant precipitation or low temperature crystallisation. The ratio of cyc!odextrin to compound used to prepare the complexes of the invention may be any convenient ratio but conveniently the cyc]odextrin is in a molar excess, The benefits derived from the invention may be obtained by having the molar ratio of cyclodextrin to compound in the range of 10:1 to 1,10 preferably 2:1 to 5:1 for example 5:1 and by using the methods and ratios described above complexes are conveniently obtained containing up to 20% w/w of the cardiac glycoside. However in view of the low doses of the cardiac glycoside normally administered and the difficulty of preparing homoCLB/em/17,12.81 A636 genous mixtures of active ingredient and excipients it may be desirable to prepare the complex with an excess of the cyclodextrin present, for example complex containing in the order of 0.01to 1% by eJzgbt of the cardiac glycoside, particu]ary in the range 0.05 to 0.2% by weight. The complexes of the invention comprise a more convenient way of administering the cardiac glycosides (whíchhave utility ín the treatment of cardiac disfunction), the cyclodextrin acting merely as a solubi]izing agent and.not altering the therapeutic behaviour of the drug ín any way. Thus the comp]exed cardiac glycosides may be administered in those dosage ranges in which they are administered in non-comp]exed form. For example dioxin is normally administered to adults in doses of about 0.25 to 1.5 mg. The inyention also provides an inclusion complex as defined hereín for use in human or veterinary medicine .... The complex, for use as a pharmaceutical, may be presented as the raw chemical but is preferably presented as a pharmaceutical formulation. The invention therefore provides in a further aspect a pharmaceutical formulation comprising an inclusion complex of a cardiac glycoside with a cyclodextrin together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier therefor and optionally other therapeutic and/or prophylactic ingredients. The carriers must be 'acceptable' in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formula and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Suitably the pharmaceutical formulation will be in unit dosage form. Each unit dose will conveniently contaîn that amount of cardiac glycoside normally incorporated into a unit dose of such drug in the absence of a cyclodextrín. For dioxin each unit dose will conveniently contain from, 0.01 to & mg of active ingredient. \. r CLB/em/17.12.81 The pharmaceutical formulations may be any formulatíon in which the inclusion complexes may be admínistered and include those suitable for oral or parenteral (including intramuscular and intravenous) administration. The formulations may, where appropriate, be conveniently presented in dìscrete dosage unìts and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Ail methods include the step of bringing into association the active compound with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers of both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for oral administration wherein the carrier is a solid are most preferably presented as unit dose formulations such as boluses, capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredìent. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active compound in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules optionally mixed With a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding an inert liquid diluent. Tablets may be optionally coated and, if uncoated, may optionally be scored. Capsules may be prepared by filling the active compound, either alone or in admixture with one or more accessory ingredients, ìnto the capsule cases and then sealing them in the usual manner. Cachets are analogous to capsules wherein the active ingredient together with any accessory ingredient(s) is sealed in a rice paper envelope. CLB/em/17.12.81 A636 Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for oral administration wherein wherein the carrier is a liquid may conveniently be presented as a solution in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Pharmaceutical formulations suitable for parenteral administration are conveniently :presented in unit dose or multi-dose containers which are sealed after introduction of the formulation until required for use. It should be understood that ín addítíon to the aforementíoned carrier ingredients the pharmaceutical formulations described above may include, as appropriate, one or more additional carrier ingredients such as diluents, buffers, flavouring agents, binders, surface active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives (iniluding anti-oxidants) and the like, and substances included for the purpose of rendering the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. The invention is illustrated in the following examples which are not intended to be a limitation thereof. EXAMPLE 1 Preparations of an inclusion complex of dioxin and B-cyc]odextrin (a) Digoxin (0.78g; 0.001 mole) and B-cyelodextrin (3.42g; 0.003 mole) were mìxed in a beaker with deionised water (10 ml), ultrasonicated and then diluted with water to give a final volume of 200 ml.
