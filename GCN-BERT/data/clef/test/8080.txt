Step 4
(2,2'-Dichlorobiphenyl-3,3'-diyl)dimethanol (15)
To a stirred solution of dimethyl 2,2'-dichlorobiphenyl-3,3'-dicarboxylate (2.3 g, 6.8 mmol) in THF (25 mL) at 0° C., LiAlH4 ((2 M in THF, 17 mL, 5 eq) was added drop wise and stirred at 0° C. for 10 min. The reaction mixture was quenched with saturated NH4Cl solution (25 mL) at 0° C. and filtered through celite pad. The celite pad was washed with methanol: CH2Cl2 (15:85) (50 mL). The organic layer was separated and dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure to get a brown oily residue, which upon trituration with n-pentane gave (2,2'-dichlorobiphenyl-3,3'-diyl)dimethanol (1.6 g, yield: 84.2%) as an off-white solid.
