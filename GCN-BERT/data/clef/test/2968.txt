The present invention involves the fields of ophthalmology, more precisely the treatment of eye disease or conditions, especially disease or condition affecting the posterior segment of the eye. A posterior ocular condition is a disease which primarily affects a posterior ocular site such as choroid or sclera, vitreous, vitreous chamber, retina, optic nerve, and blood vessels and nerves which vascularize or innervate a posterior ocular site. The present invention relates to a method for in-vivo sustained release of an active agent through intraocular invasive delivery of a prodrug thereof. Treatment of diseases or conditions affecting the posterior segment of the eye are complicated by the inaccessibility of the posterior eye to topically applied medications. Treatments of posterior eye diseases require intravitreal or periocular injections or systemic drug administration. Local injections are usually preferred to systemic drug administration because the blood/retinal barrier impedes the passage of most drugs from the systemically circulating blood to the interior of the eye. Therefore large systemic doses are needed to treat eye posterior diseases, which often result in systemic toxicities. There are diseases for which periocular injections do not allow the delivery of efficacious amounts to the target sites. For these diseases, intravitreal injections are found necessary. However, the short half-life of most injected compounds in the vitreous, a few hours only, requires frequent administrations. Injection of an active drug in significant amounts in the posterior segment of the eye, especially intravitreally, implies a sudden and massive increase in their concentration in the vitreous and even anterior segment of the eye, and can also lead to undesirable and consequent local ocular side effects. For both reasons of short half life and possible toxicity if injected in a high amount, repeated intravitreal injections may be needed. However, repeated intravitreal injections are responsible of side effects such as intraocular infections, retinal detachment or cataracts. Moreover, these injections are poorly accepted by patients unable to deal with the pain and discomfort. Some research on implant devices has been conducted in order to address these technical issues. For example, US20050244469 discloses a method for treating an ocular condition comprising the insertion of an implant into an ocular site of a patient with an ocular condition, more preferably in the vitreous body of the eye of a patient to treat a condition or disease of the posterior segment of the eye. However, there is a need for alternative solutions for providing therapeutic treatment of an ocular condition, such as posterior ocular condition. In particular, there is still a need for treatment over an extended duration, for example, time periods extending up to 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 120 days, 6 months, 8 months, 12 months or more. There is also a need to reduce the frequency of injections, such that the number of injection should be equal or less than once a month, preferably equal or less than once every 2 months, more preferably equal or less than once every three months, most preferably equal or less than once every four, five or six months. A recognized advantage of providing a method for an extended treatment is to prevent recurrence of the inflammatory or other posterior ocular condition treated. It can also minimize the number of surgical interventions required by the patient over time to treat an ocular condition. From this assumption, Applicant searched alternative therapeutic pathways for an efficient administration of ophthalmic drugs inside the eye. It is thus a goal of this invention to provide a sustained release of a therapeutically amount of an active agent for an extended duration as described hereabove, with a reduced amount of injections. One further goal of this invention is to provide a composition, delivering a therapeutic amount of at least one active drug for a sustained period in the posterior segment of the eye, without any side effects. Preferably, the composition of the invention delivers a therapeutic amount of active drug in the disease site. More preferably, the composition of the invention delivers the therapeutic amount of drug needed to treat the very pathology of the patient. According to this embodiment, the composition of the invention is of great interest for personalized methods of treatment. This invention also relates to the use of inactive prodrugs of ophthalmic active drugs for the preparation of a medicament or an ophthalmic composition intended for the treatment of an ocular condition or disease of a human being or an animal, said medicament or ophthalmic composition being administered by invasive means, preferably by intraocular injection, more preferably by intravitreal injection, for in-situ sustained release of a therapeutic effective amount of drug in the posterior segment of the eye. More precisely, the invention relates to the use of prodrug for the manufacture of a medicament or an ophthalmic composition useful for treating an ocular disease affecting the posterior segment of the eye, in a subject in need thereof, wherein the prodrug is in the form of a composition injected into the vitreous body, and the frequency of injections does not exceed one injection per month, preferably the frequency of injection is once every two months, more preferably once every six months or less frequently. The invention also relates to the use of a prodrug for providing extended duration of treatment of an ocular disease affecting the posterior segment of the eye, in a subject in need thereof, said use comprising administering an amount of a prodrug enabling the sustained release of a therapeutically amount of said drug for a duration of at least one month, preferably at least 2 months, more preferably at least six months. As used herein, prodrug refers to a drug precursor which, following administration, release the drug in vivo via some chemical or physiological process. According to an embodiment of the invention the prodrug releases the drug by a biological reaction, such as enzymatic cleavage. The prodrug may be in combination with any suitable excipient, especially any excipient injectable in the vitreous body of the eye. By “prodrug” in the meaning of this invention is preferably meant an lipophilic derivative of an ophthalmic drug, preferably a lipophilic long-chain ester of an ophthalmic drug; according to an embodiment, said, lipophilic ester is a radical comprising an ester function COO, the carbon or the oxygen atom being linked to an alkyl or an alkenyl branched or linear chain of more than 10 carbons preferentially of more than 12 carbons, more preferably of more than 14 carbons, even more preferentially of 16 carbons or more; and the other of the carbon and the oxygen atom being linked to a function of the active drug; according to a preferred embodiment, the prodrug releases the active drug when it is in contact with at least one enzyme, preferably one esterase. Esterases are generally recognized as an heterogeneous group of enzymes. Among esterases, pseudocholinesterase and acetylcholine esterase may be members of the esterases acting in the posterior segment tissues. According to an embodiment, the prodrug of the invention does not include a phosphate group. The prodrugs of the invention are preferably lipophilic prodrugs, which means that they have a poor solubility in the vitreous body, making the vitreous body a storage for said prodrugs, with little diffusion. According to an embodiment, the aqueous solubility of the prodrug of the invention is of less than 120 μg/mL, preferably of less than 50 μg/mL and more preferably of less than 10 μg/mL. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the prodrug does not have any direct therapeutic and/or physiologic effect, and is therefore called “inactive”, whereas the drug released by hydrolysis of the prodrug does have a physiological therapeutic effect. On the contrary, by “active” drug, in the meaning of this invention, is meant a drug that has a direct therapeutic and/or biological or physiologic effect. Thus, a difference has to be made between drug or drug derivatives that are therapeutically directly effective, and are “active” drugs or drug derivatives in the meaning of this invention, versus “inactive” prodrugs of the invention. Without being linked by a theory, the Applicant observed that the vitreous body contains a very limited amount of esterases. Thus, when injecting the lipophilic ester prodrug of the invention in the vitreous body, the rate of conversion to the drug is low, making the vitreous body be a storage for the prodrug. The Applicant proposes that the esterases may be situated on or around the affected tissues of the posterior segment of the eye, thus resulting in the conversion prodrug to drug at this location. Moreover, Applicant proposes that a pathology affecting the tissues of the posterior segment of the eye may correspond to higher amounts of esterases at the location of the pathology. Thus, injecting a prodrug in the vitreous may lead to both conversion of the prodrug into the drug at the very site of the pathology, in an extent corresponding to the amount of esterases, and thus to the severity of the pathology, and to keeping further storage of prodrug in the vitreous for further release. According to an embodiment of the invention, the molar ratio of the prodrug to the drug, in the vitreous, two months after one single injection of said prodrug, is preferably more than 10, more preferably more than 30, and even more preferably more than 60. According to another embodiment of the invention, the molar ratio of the prodrug to the drug, in the tissues of the posterior segment of the eye, such as for example choroid and retina, two months after one single injection of said prodrug, is preferably less than 60, preferably less than 30. Advantageously, the prodrug is injected in the vitreous in an amount enabling the sustained release of a therapeutically amount of said drug for a duration of at least one month, preferably at least 2 months, more preferably at least 6 months. According to an embodiment, the prodrug is injected with a frequency of one injection every two months. In this embodiment, the release of the prodrug and its transformation into the drug is such that a therapeutic amount of drug is present on the target site, for example retina or choroid, during two months, the prodrug being sustaineously released during this period of time. According to another embodiment of the invention, the prodrug is injected with a frequency of at most one injection every four months, preferably at most one injection every six months, and even more preferably one injection every twelve months or even less frequently. Preferably, the prodrug is within a composition, wherein said prodrug is in combination with any suitable excipient or carrier for ophthalmic use. According to a first embodiment, the carrier is oily. Examples of suitable oily carrier are mineral oils such as silicone, paraffin or vegetal oils such as medium chain triglycerides, castor oil, olive oil, corn oil, soybean oil, palm oil or any other oil suitable for intraocular injection. According to an embodiment of the invention, the weight ratio prodrug/oil in the composition of the invention is 0.04 to 0.3. According to an embodiment of the invention, the composition comprises at least one prodrug as above-defined, in combination with any ophtalmologically acceptable excipient or carrier. The carrier may be selected from a surfactant solution, an ophtalmologically acceptable oil, phospholipid vesicles or oil-in-water emulsion or water-in-oil emulsion or any other suitable carrier about 20, at least about 30 or at least about 40 weight percent of the composition/emulsion, preferably 10% of the emulsion. According to a preferred embodiment, the carrier is an emulsion, preferably an oil-in-water emulsion, more preferably an anionic emulsion. In the embodiment where the carrier is an anionic emulsion, it is preferred that said emulsion comprises colloid particles having an oily core surrounded by interfacial film, the film comprising surface active agents, lipids or both, at least part or the surface active agents or lipids in the interfacial film having negatively charged polar groups, and the colloid particles have a negative zeta potential. Preferably, the prodrug is comprised within the emulsion in an amount of about 0.01% to about 10% w/w of the composition. According to an embodiment, the prodrug is comprised in the amount of about 0.5% to about 3% w/w of the composition. In a preferred embodiment, the prodrug is comprised in an amount of about 2% w/w of the composition. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the prodrug is comprised in an amount of about 1% w/w of the composition. Excipient characteristics that are considered include, but are not limited to, the biocompatibility and biodegradability at the site of injection, compatibility with the prodrug of interest, and processing temperatures. When the excipient or the carrier is an emulsion, according to an embodiment of the invention, the oil phase represents at least about 1, at least about 5, at least about 10, at least about 20, at least about 30 or at least about 40 weight percent of the composition. In a preferred embodiment, the oil represents 10 weight percent of the composition. In this embodiment, the composition includes at least one surfactant, preferably in an amount of 0.1-10% w/w of the composition. According to an embodiment, the surfactant is selected from phospholipids, poloxamers, tyloxapol, polysorbate, and polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters. In this embodiment, the composition preferably includes at least one isotonicity agent, preferably in an amount of 0.1-10% w/w of the composition. According to an embodiment, the isotonicity agent is glycerol. Preferably, the composition of the invention is as follows: Role Amount (w/w) Prodrug 0.01-10% Oil 1-40% Surfactant 0.1-10% Tonicity agent 0.1-10% Dispersing medium Up to 100% According to an embodiment, the composition of the invention is as follows: Role Amount (w/w) Prodrug 0.1-5% Oil 8-12% Surfactant 0.5-2% Tonicity agent 1-3% Dispersing medium Up to 100% In an embodiment of the invention, the amount of prodrug to be administrated, preferably a lipophilic ester of dexamethasone, more preferably dexamethasone palmitate, is an amount therapeutically equivalent to 0.01-6 μmol, preferably 0.1-2.5 μmol, more preferably 0.15 to 1.3 μmol of drug, preferably dexamethasone. In a further embodiment the molar amount of prodrug administered is higher than the highest non-toxic molar amount of corresponding injected by the same administration mode. The Applicant performed a number of tests and noticed that the invention had the further advantage that he could not detect any release of drug in the plasma, which may mean that there is none or few passage of the drug released through the general system of the subject, and in any event, no related side effect is observed. In the meaning of this invention, injecting in the vitreous body means performing an intravitreal injection. According to the invention, the hydrolysis of the prodrug results in therapeutically amounts of drug at the targeted site of action, preferably at retina and/or choroid. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the half-life of the prodrug in the target tissue is of at least 15 days, preferably of at least 30 days, preferably of at least 60 days, preferably of at least 6 months. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the prodrug does not cause vision impairment or troubles. The present invention intends to propose solutions for treating various ophthalmic or ocular conditions and diseases. The present invention is especially designed for the treatment of posterior ocular conditions, which means any disease, ailment or condition which primarily affects or involves a posterior ocular site such as choroid or sclera (in a position posterior to a plane through the posterior wall of the lens capsule), vitreous, vitreous chamber, retina, optic nerve (including the optic disc), and blood vessels and nerves which vascularize or innervate a posterior ocular site.

Analytical Methods for Simultaneous Determination of Dexamethasone and Dexamethasone Palmitate in Ocular Tissues A liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric method for the simultaneous determination of dexamethasone and dexamethasone palmitate in ocular tissues was developed. Analytes and internal standard (roxithromycine) were extracted from the tissues using acetonitrile and separated by reverse phase liquid chromatography with a C8 column and a gradient mobile phase. The compounds were detected by mass spectrometric detection (atmospheric pressure ionization) with selected ion monitoring (SIM) (393.0 for dexamethasone and 631.5 for dexamethasone palmitate). The method was selective for both compounds and the limits of quantification were 32.7 ng/g of retina and 71.6 ng/g choroid. The unweighed linear model was applied. 2. Intraocular Pharmacokinetics of Dexamethasone Palmitate and Dexamethasone Following Intravitreal Administration Methods: One single unilateral injection of a 0.8% (8 mg/ml) dexamethasone palmitate emulsion was administered intravitreally (100 □L) to rabbits. Animals were sacrificed at days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28 or 60 days (n=4/timepoint). Dexamethasone (D) and dexamethasone palmitate (DP) in tissues were determined. All concentrations are expressed in ng/g. Results: Day 1 Day 7 Day 14 Day 28 Day 60 Mean sd Mean sd Mean sd Mean sd Mean sd Retina DP 106 74 93 38 136 19 146 109 55 37 (nmol/g) D 7 2 11 4 6 4 4 1 2 2 (nmol/g) DP/D 15.14 8.45 22.6 36.5 25 Choroid DP 191 69 103 77 22 11 143 61 52 22 (nmol/g) D 12 6 12 7 9 4 4.2 1 3 2 (nmol/g) DP/D 15.91 8.58 2.44 35.65 17.33 Aqueous DP ND ND ND ND ND ND ND ND 0 0 humor (nmol/g) D ND ND ND ND ND ND ND ND 0 1 (nmol/g) ND: Not determined. Following IVT injection of a dose of 800 μg of prodrug, dexamethasone therapeutic levels of about 1000 ng/g were maintained for at least 2 months in the target tissues. Moreover, considerable amounts of the prodrug dexapalmitate remained in both retina and choroid, indicating an even more long-lasting release. At the same time, the amounts of steroid in the vitreous and plasma were undetectable, suggesting fewer (if any) side effects in adjacent sites. This last fact was corroborated by IOP measurements, which were normal 2 months following the injection. 1.
