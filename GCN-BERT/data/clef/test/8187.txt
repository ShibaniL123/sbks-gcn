184.5: 4-(7-methylsulphanyl-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidine-1-tert-butyl carboxylate
2.5 g (20 mmol) of N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole is added in portions to a solution of 5.1 g (14 mmol) of 4-[2-(2-amino-5-methylsulphanyl-phenyl)-ethylamino]-piperidine-1-tert-butyl carboxylate in 77 mL of acetonitrile. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 18 hours and then diluted with ethyl acetate and hydrolysed with a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride. The product is extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phases are combined, washed once with water and once with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, then dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The crude residue is purified by silica gel chromatography eluted with a heptane/ethyl acetate mixture in increasing polarity from 7/3 to 5/5. 2.4 g (44%) of 4-[2-(2-amino-5-methylsulphanyl-phenyl)-ethylamino]-piperidine-1-tert-butyl carboxylate is obtained.
