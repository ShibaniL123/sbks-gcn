TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a polishing composition used mainly in polishing an object-to-be-polished, such as semiconductor wafers including silicon wafers, formed from a semiconductor device material. BACKGROUND ART It has been conventionally known, mainly in order to obtain a higher polishing rate, to use non-spherical colloidal silica or colloidal silica having bimodal particle diameter distribution as abrasive grains in polishing compositions (see, for example, Patent Documents 1 and 2).

In the above described aspect, the volume fraction of particles having a diameter of greater than 300 nm in the colloidal silica is preferably less than 2%. Effects of the Invention According to the present invention, there is provided a polishing composition containing colloidal silica that has both an excellent polishing rate and sedimentation stability. MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION One embodiment of the present invention will now be described. A polishing composition according to the present embodiment contains at least colloidal silica. The polishing composition is used mainly in an application to polish an object-to-be-polished formed from a semiconductor device material, for example, an application to polish a semiconductor wafer, such as silicon wafers and compound semiconductor wafers, or dielectric or conductive material films formed on wafers. Colloidal silica in the polishing composition is required to satisfy the following expression: [in-line-formulae]A×D×E×F≧350,000[/in-line-formulae] wherein “A” denotes the average aspect ratio (dimensionless) of the colloidal silica; “D” denotes the average particle diameter (units: nm) of the colloidal silica; “E” denotes the standard deviation of the particle diameter (units: nm) of the colloidal silica; and “F” denotes the volume fraction (units: %) of particles having a diameter of 1 to 300 nm in the colloidal silica, with A×D×E×F being preferably 370,000 or greater. In addition, the colloidal silica preferably satisfies the following expression: [in-line-formulae]A×B×D×E×F≧30,000[/in-line-formulae] wherein “B” denotes the standard deviation (dimensionless) of the aspect ratio of the colloidal silica, With A×B×D×E×F being more preferably 60,000 or greater. The aspect ratio of each particle in colloidal silica can be determined by dividing the length of the long side of a minimum rectangular circumscribing an image of the particle obtained by scanning electron microscopy by the length of the short side of the same rectangular. The average aspect ratio and the standard deviation of the aspect ratio of the colloidal silica are the average and standard deviation of aspect ratio of multiple particles within a visual field of a scanning electron microscope, which can be determined with a conventional image analysis software program. The particle diameter of each particle in colloidal silica can be determined as the diameter of a circle having the same area as the area of the particle in an image thereof obtained by scanning electron microscopy. The average particle diameter and the standard deviation of the particle diameter of the colloidal silica are the average and standard deviation of particle size of multiple particles within a visual field of a scanning electron microscope, which can also be determined with a conventional image analysis software program. When the colloidal silica satisfies A×D×E×F≧350,000, and specifically 370,000, the colloidal silica has a relatively high average aspect ratio, contains a relatively high amount of particles having the size effective for polishing, and has relatively broad particle diameter distribution, thereby allowing a high polishing rate. When the colloidal silica satisfies A×B×D×E×F≧30,000, and specifically ≧60,000, the colloidal silica has relatively broad aspect ratio distribution as well, thereby improving the polishing rate of the polishing composition. The volume fraction (“F”) of particles having a diameter of 1 to 300 nm in the colloidal silica is required to be 90% or greater and preferably 95% or greater. When this value is 90% or greater, and specifically 95% or greater, the colloidal silica contains less amount of large particles that may easily cause sedimentation, thereby allowing high sedimentation stability. When the polishing composition has poor sedimentation stability, such disadvantages may result that many scratches may be produced on an object-to-be-polished after polishing with the polishing composition, satisfactory smoothness of the surface of the object-to-be-polished may not be obtained, or a stable polishing rate may not be obtained because the polishing composition is not supplied stably during polishing. The volume of each particle in colloidal silica can be determined as the volume of a sphere having the same diameter as the particle diameter of the particle determined by the method described above. The volume fraction of particles having a diameter of 50 nm or greater and an aspect ratio of 1.2 or greater in the colloidal silica is preferably 50% or greater and more preferably 60% or greater. When this value is 50% or greater, and specifically 60% or greater, the colloidal silica contains more particles having the size and aspect ratio particularly effective for polishing, thereby improving the polishing rate of the polishing composition. The volume fraction of particles having a diameter of greater than 300 nm in the colloidal silica is preferably less than 2% and more preferably less than 1.5%. When this value is less than 2%, and specifically less than 1.5%, the sedimentation stability of the polishing composition is further improved. The content of colloidal silica in the polishing composition is not particularly limited and in general is preferably 0.1 to 20% by mass, more preferably 1.0 to 15% by mass, and still more preferably 3.0 to 10% by mass. The pH of the polishing composition can be appropriately selected depending on the type of the object-to-be-polished. When the object-to-be-polished is a silicon wafer, the polishing composition preferably has a pH of 10 to 12. When the object-to-be-polished is a compound semiconductor, such as gallium arsenide, the polishing composition preferably has a pH of 6 to 10. When the object-to-be-polished is a semiconductor device, the polishing composition preferably has a pH of 2 to 11. When the object-to-be-polished is glass, the polishing composition preferably has a pH in the range of 2 to 4 or 9 to 11. The pH can be adjusted by adding an alkali or acid to the polishing composition. According to the present embodiment, the following advantage is obtained. A polishing composition of the present embodiment contains colloidal silica that satisfies A×D×E×F≧350,000, wherein “A” is the average aspect ratio (dimensionless); “D” is the average particle diameter (units: nm); “E” is the standard deviation of the particle diameter (units: nm); and “F” is the volume fraction (units: %) of particles having a diameter of 1 to 300 nm. Accordingly, the colloidal silica has a relatively high average aspect ratio, contains a relatively high amount of particles having the size effective for polishing, and has relatively broad particle diameter distribution, thereby allowing a polishing composition of the present embodiment to have a high rate of polishing an object-to-be-polished. Because of the fact that the volume fraction of particles having a diameter of 1 to 300 nm in the colloidal silica contained in the polishing composition is 90% or greater, the colloidal silica contains less amount of large particles that may easily cause sedimentation, thereby allowing a polishing composition of the present embodiment to have high sedimentation stability. Thus according to the present embodiment, a polishing composition containing colloidal silica having both an excellent polishing rate and sedimentation stability is provided. The above embodiment may be modified as follows. A polishing composition of the above embodiment may further contain a known additive as required. For example, the polishing composition may contain any of the followings: (a) alkalis, such as alkali metal hydroxides, alkali metal salts, ammonia, ammonium salts, amines, amine compounds, quaternary ammonium hydroxides, and quaternary ammonium salts, (b) inorganic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphonic acid, nitric acid, phosphinic acid, and boric acid, or organic acids, such as acetic acid, itaconic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, glycolic acid, malonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, formic acid, malic acid, gluconic acid, alanine, glycine, lactic acid, hydroxyethylidene diphosphonic acid (HEDP), nitrilotris[methylene phosphonic acid] (NTMP), and phosphonobutane tricarboxylic acid (PBTC), (c) nonionic, anionic, cationic, or amphoteric surfactants, (d) water soluble polymers, such as water soluble celluloses, vinyl polymers, and polyalkylene oxides, (e) chelating agents, such as polyamines, polyphosphonic acids, polyamino carboxylic acids, and polyamino phosphonic acids, (f) oxidants, such as hydrogen peroxide, peroxides, oxygen acids, and acidic metal salt compounds, and (g) other additives, such as fungicides, bactericidal agents, and biocides. A polishing composition of the above embodiment may be prepared by diluting an undiluted solution of the polishing composition with water. A polishing composition of the above embodiment may be used in applications other than polishing an object-to-be-polished formed from a semiconductor device material. Next, examples and comparative examples of the present invention will be described. Polishing compositions of Examples 1 to 3 and Comparative Examples 1 to 10 were prepared by diluting colloidal silica slurry with pure water and then adjusting the pH with a 48% by mass potassium hydroxide aqueous solution to 11.0. The content of colloidal silica in all polishing compositions is 10.0% by mass.
