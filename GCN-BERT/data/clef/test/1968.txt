FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed generally to sports, exercise, energy and/or food beverages and more particularly to electrokinetically-altered, oxygenated sports, energy and/or food beverages. Particular aspects relate to the use of electrokinetically-altered fluids (e.g., gas-enriched (e.g., superoxygenated) electrokinetic fluids, comprising an ionic aqueous solution of charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures) administered in an amount sufficient to provide for enhancing at least one of physiological performance and recovery time. Certain aspects relate to administering said beverages in an amount sufficient to provide for preventing exercise-induced muscle and/or tendon damage and/or enhancing/facilitating muscle and/or tendon recovery from exercise and/or exercise-induced damage). Certain aspects relate to preventing and/or ameliorating and/or enhancing recovery from muscle or tendon strain associated with chronic, repetitive movement. Further aspects relate to ameliorating the effects of physical exertion of the subject. Certain aspects relate to improved methods for producing electrokinetically altered aqueous fluids (including sports beverages). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In humans and other animals, exercise, strenuous training, and exposure to elements (e.g., sunlight, wind, rain, cold and heat) can result in significant physiological changes. Subjects exercising or training are at risk for developing injuries (e.g., muscle and/or tendon damage), especially subjects doing so in extreme conditions (e.g., cold or heat, high altitude, long durations, high intensity, repetitive, aerobic, contact sports, etc.). For example, excessive heat temperatures, in particular, environmental heat illnesses include but are not limited to heat syncope, heat exhaustion, dehydration syndrome, and heat stroke. The potentially fatal clinical syndrome of heat stroke has been described in marathon runners, military recruits, football players, and in hot industrial environments. An epidemic appearance of heat stroke has been described during heat waves in urban areas (Ferguson, M., And M. M. O'brien, “Heat Stroke In New York City: Experience With 25 Cases,” N.Y. State J. Med. 60:2531-2538, 1960). Likewise, impaired or incomplete recovery following high-intensity exercise can negatively affect physical performance and delay functional progression, thereby reducing an athlete's chance of performing at his or her peak level. Athletes are constantly seeking ways to prevent exercise-induced muscle damage and facilitate muscle recovery from strenuous exercise. For example, athletes have used dietary supplements extensively to facilitate tissue growth and repair following muscle-damaging events such as high-intensity resistance exercise and participation in contact sports. Following strenuous exercise, an acute inflammatory response drives the repair process by synthesizing and releasing chemical mediators locally in the injured muscle. However, while inflammatory mediators may help attract growth factors used for protein synthesis and muscle repair, excessive inflammatory response may damage muscle and thereby hinder the repair process. “Dehydration syndrome” may be characterized and/or accompanied by loss of appetite and limited capacity for work. Evidence of heat exhaustion becomes apparent with losses of, for example, 5% of the body water, and at about 7% loss of body water disorientation and hallucinations may occur. Losses of body water of 10% or greater are extremely hazardous and lead to heat stroke and death if not treated immediately. Heat stroke is accompanied by high body temperature (41.1° C.-43.3° C.; 106° F.-110° F.), deep coma, and in most cases a complete absence of sweating, and failure of major organ systems. At least three factors determine the thermal balance of the body: metabolic heat production, heat exchange between the organism and its surroundings, and heat loss by the evaporation of sweat (Knochel, J. P. [1980] “Clinical Physiology Of Heat Exposure,” In Clinical Disorders Of Fluid And Electrolyte Metabolism, M. H. Maxwell And C. R. Kleeman, Eds., Mcgraw-Hill, New York). For the subject exercising or working, particularly in a hot environment, the capacity to dissipate metabolically produced heat depends for the most part on the subject's ability to form and vaporize sweat (Costill, D. L. And K. E. Sparks “Rapid Fluid Replacement Following Thermal Dehydration,” J. Appl. Physiol. 34(3):299-303, 1973; Greenleaf, J. E. “Hyperthermia And Exercise,” Int. Rev. Physiol. 20:157-208, 1979). During exercise, especially in a hot environment, serious deficits in effective circulating volume may occur. Muscular work, independent of environment, results in massive shunting of blood to skeletal muscle, along with a substantial loss of plasma volume into the working muscle. Moreover, effective circulating volume is also diminished by losses of sweat (Knochel [1980] supra). The deficit in intravascular volume impedes the delivery of heated blood to the periphery for evaporative cooling. Thus, in the dehydrated exercising subject, there is a progressive increase in the core body temperature as sweat losses accumulate. Notable among the many physiological responses to physical exertion are increased body temperature, perspiration and pulse rate, a decrease in the blood volume, and biochemical changes associated with the metabolism of compounds to produce energy. In addition, approximately 90% of the body's energy is created by oxygen. All of the activities of the body, from brain function to elimination, are regulated by oxygen. Blood plasma holds approximately three percent (3%) dissolved oxygen, and red blood cells (hemoglobin) hold ninety-seven percent (97%). From the red blood cells the oxygen passes out into the plasma and is transferred to cells that need oxygen during metabolic processes. These cells pass CO2 back to the plasma where it is then picked up by the red blood cells. This process rapidly increases, for example, during exercise and strenuous training. Prior research in the art has focused on the ability of glycerol to cause water retention. However, water retention alone has little or no correlation with enhanced endurance or physiological performance. In order to have a beneficial effect on endurance and performance, water must be appropriately allocated throughout the body. Mere reduction in urine output is insufficient. Water must be available for sweating (efficient cooling), hydration of cells, and plasma volume must be maintained. Only if these physiological objectives are met can endurance and performance be enhanced. Osmotic pressure is primarily responsible for the direction and rate of movement of water across semi permeable membranes in the body. Thus, water will move across a semi permeable membrane such that the net flow of water will be across the membrane into the fluid which initially had the highest concentration of solutes, and thus the allocation of water between digestive organs, blood plasma, and cells depends upon the relative osmotic pressures between these sites. Although it has been established that the ingestion of massive amounts of glycerol results in the retention of water within the body (i.e., the rate of urine flow is decreased), this observation alone produces no information as to whether the body's physiological responses to heat or physical exertion have been enhanced. For example, a large concentration of glycerol in the stomach or intestine can cause water to move across the gastrointestinal membranes into the digestive tract and cause detrimental responses to physical exertion and heat exposure. Alternatively, high concentrations of plasma glycerol can cause water to leave the cells and enter the plasma, resulting in detrimental cellular dehydration. There is, therefore, a pronounced need in the art for novel and effective methods to enhance exercise performance and recovery time and related conditions as described herein.

According to particular aspects, in ionic or saline (e.g., water, saline, standard saline, etc.) solutions, the inventive nanostructures comprise charge stabilized nanostructures (e.g., average diameter less that 100 nm) that may comprise at least one dissolved gas molecule (e.g., oxygen) within a charge-stabilized hydration shell. According to additional aspects, and as described elsewhere herein, the charge-stabilized hydration shell may comprise a cage or void harboring the at least one dissolved gas molecule (e.g., oxygen). According to further aspects, by virtue of the provision of suitable charge-stabilized hydration shells, the charge-stabilized nanostructure and/or charge-stabilized oxygen containing nano-structures may additionally comprise a solvated electron (e.g., stabilized solvated electron). Without being bound by mechanism or particular theory, charge-stabilized microbubbles stabilized by ions in aqueous liquid in equilibrium with ambient (atmospheric) gas have been proposed (Bunkin et al., Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics, 104:486-498, 2007; incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). According to particular aspects of the present invention, Applicants' novel electrokinetic fluids comprise a novel, biologically active form of charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures, and may further comprise novel arrays, clusters or associations of such structures. According to the charge-stabilized microbubble model, the short-range molecular order of the water structure is destroyed by the presence of a gas molecule (e.g., a dissolved gas molecule initially complexed with a nonadsorptive ion provides a short-range order defect), providing for condensation of ionic droplets, wherein the defect is surrounded by first and second coordination spheres of water molecules, which are alternately filled by adsorptive ions (e.g., acquisition of a ‘screening shell of Na+ ions to form an electrical double layer) and nonadsorptive ions (e.g., Cl− ions occupying the second coordination sphere) occupying six and 12 vacancies, respectively, in the coordination spheres. In under-saturated ionic solutions (e.g., undersaturated saline solutions), this hydrated ‘nucleus’ remains stable until the first and second spheres are filled by six adsorptive and five nonadsorptive ions, respectively, and then undergoes Coulomb explosion creating an internal void containing the gas molecule, wherein the adsorptive ions (e.g., Na+ ions) are adsorbed to the surface of the resulting void, while the nonadsorptive ions (or some portion thereof) diffuse into the solution (Bunkin et al., supra). In this model, the void in the nanostructure is prevented from collapsing by Coulombic repulsion between the ions (e.g., Na+ ions) adsorbed to its surface. The stability of the void-containing nanostructures is postulated to be due to the selective adsorption of dissolved ions with like charges onto the void/bubble surface and diffusive equilibrium between the dissolved gas and the gas inside the bubble, where the negative (outward electrostatic pressure exerted by the resulting electrical double layer provides stable compensation for surface tension, and the gas pressure inside the bubble is balanced by the ambient pressure. According to the model, formation of such microbubbles requires an ionic component, and in certain aspects collision-mediated associations between particles may provide for formation of larger order clusters (arrays) (Id). The charge-stabilized microbubble model of Bunkin et al., suggests that the particles can be gas microbubbles, but contemplates only spontaneous formation of such structures in ionic solution in equilibrium with ambient air, is uncharacterized and silent as to whether oxygen is capable of forming such structures, how such structures might be further stabilized, and is likewise silent as to whether solvated electrons might be associated and/or stabilized by such structures. According to particular aspects of the present invention, the inventive electrokinetic fluids comprising charge-stabilized nanostructures and/or charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures are novel and fundamentally distinct from the postulated non-electrokinetic, atmospheric charge-stabilized microbubble structures according to the microbubble model. Significantly, this conclusion is unavoidable, deriving, at least in part, from the fact that control saline solutions do not have the biological properties disclosed herein, whereas Applicants' charge-stabilized nanostructures provide a novel, biologically active form of charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures. According to particular aspects of the present invention, Applicants' novel electrokinetic device and methods provide for novel electrokinetically-altered fluids comprising significant quantities of charge-stabilized nanostructures in excess of any amount that may or may not spontaneously occur in ionic fluids in equilibrium with air, or in any non-electrokinetically generated fluids. In particular aspects, the charge-stabilized nanostructures comprise charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures. In additional aspects, the charge-stabilized nanostructures are all, or substantially all charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures, or the charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures is the major charge-stabilized gas-containing nanostructure species in the electrokinetic fluid. According to yet further aspects, the charge-stabilized nanostructures and/or the charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures may comprise or harbor a solvated electron and/or electric field (electric double layer), and thereby provide a novel stabilized solvated electron, or electric field carrier. In particular aspects, the charge-stabilized nanostructures and/or the charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures provide a novel type of electride (or inverted electride), which in contrast to conventional solute electrides having a single organically coordinated cation, rather have a plurality of cations stably arrayed about a void or a void containing an oxygen atom, wherein the arrayed sodium ions are coordinated by water hydration shells, rather than by organic molecules. According to particular aspects, a solvated electron and or electric field (electric double layer) may be accommodated by the hydration shell of water molecules, or a hydrated electron may be accommodated within the nanostructure void and distributed over all the cations. In certain aspects, therefore, the inventive nanostructures provide a novel ‘super electride’ structure in solution by not only providing for distribution/stabilization of the solvated electron and/or electric field over multiple arrayed sodium cations, but also providing for association or partial association of a solvated electron with the caged oxygen molecule(s) in the void—the solvated electron distributing over an array of sodium atoms and at least one oxygen atom. According to particular aspects, therefore, ‘solvated electrons’ in the inventive electrokinetic fluids, may not be solvated in the traditional model comprising direct hydration by water molecules. Alternatively, in limited analogy with dried electride salts, solvated electrons in the inventive electrokinetic fluids may be distributed over multiple charge-stabilized nanostructures to provide a ‘lattice glue’ to stabilize higher order arrays in aqueous solution. In particular aspects, the inventive charge-stabilized nanostructures and/or the charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures are capable of interacting with cellular membranes or constituents thereof, or proteins, etc., to mediate biological activities. In particular aspects, the inventive charge-stabilized nanostructures and/or the charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures harboring a solvated electron and/or electric field (electric double layer) are capable of interacting with cellular membranes or constituents thereof, or proteins, etc., to mediate biological activities. In particular aspects, the inventive charge-stabilized nanostructures and/or the charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures interact with cellular membranes or constituents thereof, or proteins, etc., as a charge and/or charge effect donor (delivery) and/or as a charge and/or charge effect recipient to mediate biological activities. In particular aspects, the inventive charge-stabilized nanostructures and/or the charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures harboring a solvated electron and/or electric field (electric double layer) interact with cellular membranes as a charge and/or charge effect donor and/or as a charge and/or charge effect recipient to mediate biological activities. In particular aspects, the inventive charge-stabilized nanostructures and/or the charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures are consistent with, and account for the observed stability and biological properties of the inventive electrokinetic fluids, and further provide a novel electride (or inverted electride) that provides for stabilized solvated electrons and/or electric fields (e.g., electric double layers) in aqueous ionic solutions (e.g., water, saline solutions, berverages, etc.). In particular aspects, the charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures substantially comprise, take the form of, or can give rise to, charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanobubbles. In particular aspects, charge-stabilized oxygen-containing clusters provide for formation of relatively larger arrays of charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures, and/or charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanobubbles or arrays thereof.

In particular aspects, charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures comprise or give rise to surface nanobubbles (e.g., hydrophobic nanobubbles) of about 20 nm×1.5 nm, comprise about 12 oxygen molecules (e.g., based on the size of an oxygen molecule (approx 0.3 nm by 0.4 nm), assumption of an ideal gas and application of n=PV/RT, where P=1 atm, R=0.0820571.atm/mol.K; T=295K; V=pr2h=4.7×10−22 L, where r=10×10−9 m, h=1.5×10−9 m, and n=1.95×10−22 moles).

For pure water this occurs at about 4° C., and is 1.0000 g/cm3 plus or minus 0.0001. Without being bound by mechanism, the optimal temperature for producing biologically active electrokinetic fluids likely coincides with providing a water structure that unexpectedly (with respect to water structures present at other temperatures or temperature ranges) facilitates the formation of charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures according to the present specification. As appreciated in the art, the maximum density of water occurs at about 4° C., with the density falling with decreasing or increasing temperature. According to particular aspects, this temperature density profile indicates that prior to freezing, there is a unique water structure that occurs at or near the maximum density, and/or between the freezing point temperature of the aqueous fluid and the temperature of maximum aqueous density of the fluid, wherein said unique water structure optimally facilitates the formation of charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures according to the present specification. In particular aspects, this may reflect a water structure providing hydrogen bonding that is similar to, or required in the hydrogen bonding in the aqueous hydration shells of the charge-stabilized oxygen-containing nanostructures according to the present specification. In further aspects, optimal production of biologically active electrokinetic aqueous fluids comprises introduction of gas at elevated pressures, including at elevated pressures in combination with the optimal temperature parameters discussed above. The standard atmosphere (atm) is a unit of pressure defined as being equal to 101,325 Pa or 101.325 kPa (e.g., 0.101 Mpa, 760 mmHg (Torr), 29.92 in Hg, 14.696 PSI, 1013.25 millibars). In particular aspects, the gas (e.g., oxygen gas in introduced into the mixing chamber of the electrokinetic mixing device at a pressure of at least 0.5 psi, at least 15 psi, at least 30, at least 45, at least 60, at least 75, at least 90, and preferably a pressure is used that is between about 15 psi and 100 psi. In particular aspects the oxygen pressure is at least 35 psi. In particular aspects, there is a gradient of pressure across the rotating mixing chamber from one end to the other (e.g., from 25 psi to 15 psi, with a 10 psi drop across the device), where such gradient may comprise, for example, pressure gradients within the range of about 0.5 psi and 100 psi, or within a sub range thereof. In particular aspects, feature-induced cavitations of a rotating mixing device having an array of features (US2008/02190088 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,832,920), US2008/0281001 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,919,534); US2010/0038244, WO2008/052143,) provide for elaboration, within the mixing chamber, of discontinuous cavitation-induced pressurization-depressurization events localized at or near the features during electrokinetic fluid processing. In particular aspects, elaboration of discontinuous cavitation-induced pressurization-depressurization events with the mixing chamber is combined with introduction of oxygen to the mixing chamber at increased pressure as described above. In particular aspects, oxygen is introduced into the mixing chamber of the electrokinetic mixing device by introducing liquid oxygen into the mixing chamber of the electrokinetic mixing device. Example 2 The Stability of the Biological Activity of the Disclosed Electrokinetic Aqueous Fluids was Shown to be Temperature Dependent RNS60 modulates the expression of IL8. RNS60 is produced when isotonic saline is processed through the disclosed electrokinetic mixing device under 1 atmosphere of oxygen back-pressure, resulting in an oxygen content of 60 ppm. In order to test if RNS60 has additional effects on the bronchial epithelial cells, we tested for the release of multiple inflammatory mediators. Inflammation of the airway tissues is considered highly relevant in respiratory disease progression. Respiratory tract proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8 are used to access the epithelial cell response to environmental stimulants. In this experiment, we tested the effects of RNS60 on IL-8 secretion in human airway epithelial cells, when challenged with diesel exhaust particle (DEP) and recombinant TNFa(rTNFα). Methods. The HBEpC cells were pretreated with serum free media containing saline solutions (NS or RNS60) and incubated at 37° C. for 1 hour. Cells were then stimulated with rTNFa or DEP and incubated over night. HBEpC culture supernatants were harvested and IL-8 ELISA was performed. Results. The experiments were repeated three times and representative data is shown here. FIG. 47a shows that RNS60 regulates DEP-induced IL8 secretion. HBEpC were pre-treated with 10-30% NS or RNS60 for 1 hour, then stimulated with 100 ug/ml of DEP and incubated overnight at 37° C., supernatants were harvested and IL-8 ELISA was performed. Averaged data from three replicates are shown here. FIG. 47 b shows that RNS60 regulates rTNFa induced IL8, and it retains its biological activity at room temperature for days. HBEpC were pre-treated with 30% NS or RNS60 and stimulated with 100 ng/ml of rTNFa as described above, supernatants were harvested and IL-8 ELISA was performed. Averaged data from three replicates are shown. As shown in FIGS. 47a & b, RNS60 significantly suppresses DEP or rTNFa induced IL-8 secretion by primary human bronchial cells. Moreover, the biological activity (IL-8 efficacy) of RNS60 can be reversed, at least in part, by leaving the fluid at 18-22° C. (room temperature) for 8 to 10 days as demonstrated by FIG. 47b. According to particular aspects, therefore, once produced, the stability of the biological activity of the disclosed electrokinetic aqueous fluids is also temperature dependent. According to particular aspects, the optimal temperature for the stability of the biological activity of the disclosed electrokinetic aqueous fluids is at a temperature between about −2° C. and about 10° C., between about −2° C. and about 5° C., between about 0° C. and about 5° C., and preferably at about 4° C. or a temperature equivalent to the maximum aqueous density of the fluid being processed (as the maximum density may vary somewhat with the salt concentration of the aqueous fluid). In particular aspects, the optimal temperature for the stability of the biological activity of the disclosed electrokinetic aqueous fluids is at about 0° C. to about 4° C., 0° C. to about 3° C., 0° C. to about 2° C., 0° C. to about 1° C., 2° C. to about 4° C., or 3° C. to about 4° C. In additional aspects, the optimal temperature for the stability of the biological activity of the disclosed electrokinetic aqueous fluids is also at the temperature of highest density of the aqueous (e.g., water or saline) fluid (e.g., 4° C.). For pure water an most saline solutions this occurs at about 4° C., and is 1.0000 g/cm3 plus or minus 0.0001. In particular aspects the stability of the biological activity of the electrokinetically-altered fluid is also enhanced if it is stored in a closed container with no, or little “head” volume. Preferably, if there is a “head volume” in the storage container, it is minimal oxygen-comprising head volume. Example 3 Beneficial Effects of Electrokinetically Processed Fluids on Human Exercise Performance and/or Recovery were Demonstrated Overview: Athletic performance is determined by many parameters that include age, genetics, training, and biomechanics. In addition, optimized diet and hydration are important factors in achieving and sustaining maximal performance. Beverages currently available in the market place aim at boosting performance by additives that include electrolytes, proteins, carbohydrates, or caffeine. Particular aspects of the present invention provide an innovative approach to athletic performance enhancement by offering a product that protects muscle cells through charge-stabilized nanostructure (CSN) technology. CSN-containing fluids were generated using Applicant's proprietary process that involves Taylor-Couette-Poiseuille flow in the presence of oxygen. The effects of electrokinetically-processed water on human treadmill exercise performance was evaluated by Seattle Performance Medicine, Seattle, Wash. According to particular aspects, therefore, daily consumption of RSB prior to strenuous exercise improves performance and enhance training adaptation. Materials and Methods: RSB was produced using a proprietary pump involving Taylor-Couette-Poiseuille flow in the presence of oxygen as described herein. The test fluid was an electrokinetically-altered purified water (BEV-A) processed as described herein (see also US2008/02190088 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,832,920), US2008/0281001 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,919,534); US2010/0038244, WO2008/052143). The dissolve oxygen concentration (D.O.) for the test fluid was 52.4 ppm. The control (negative control) was a corresponding, but non-electrokinetically-processed purified water. A double blind, randomized crossover study, was performed wherein 25 fit, male subjects (age: 18 to 35 years) consumed either RSB (CSN-containing fluid; BEV-A) or purified water (PW) as control for 2 weeks followed by a 60-minute treadmill exercise at 75% maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max). VO2max was determined according to the Modified Astrand protocol and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was recorded according to the Modified Borg Scale at 15 and 50 minutes. Plasma markers of skeletal muscle breakdown, myoglobin and creatine kinase (CPK), were measured by ELISA. In addition, plasma concentrations of selected cytokines were measured with a Luminex 52-plex cytokine assay. Consent forms, dietary and exercise protocols and diary workbooks were provided to all subjects. Prior to consumption of the study test and control beverages, Groups A and B consumed the same non-electrokinetically-altered “washout” beverage. Group A subjects began to consume their respective washout beverage one day before Group B and consumption of washout beverage continued for approx one-month prior to the start of the comparative study. Group A and B subjects consumed their respective alternate beverage for 2 weeks.

Test Article: Both control and test articles were stored under refrigerated conditions. Each bottle was labeled at the time of manufacture with the label key confidentially maintained at the Sponsor's facility. Both test and control articles were distributed to the subjects and kept refrigerated prior to consumption. Study Subjects: The study subjects were males between the ages of 18 and 35, having varying levels of fitness. The subjects were determined to be in good health with no pre-existing conditions and on no medications. Diet and activity levels were standardized prior to the start of the test article consumption. Blood Samples: Blood samples were taken for lactic acid at 20, 40 and 60 minutes (just prior to the end of exercise) during exercise. Venous samples were drawn prior to each beverage cycle, just prior to exercise, at 30 and 60 minutes after the start of exercise, and then 24 hrs after the exercise was completed. These samples included a cbc, complete metabolic profile, magnesium, calcium, phosphorous, myoglobin, lactic acid, CPK, CRP and Luminex cytokine analysis. Luminex samples were analyzed for cytokines including IL-1b, TNF-a, IL-6, IL-8, INF-g, IL-4 and others as determined by the sponsor. 24-hr urine collection for total volume, creatinine clearance, osmolarity and urine electrolytes was collected prior to starting beverage, prior to exhaustive exercise and 24 hrs after exercise. Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis was stratified based on VO2 Max (as example: 25-40 ml/kg/min and 41-60 ml/kg/min) and also examined as a whole. VO2 max, or maximal oxygen uptake, is one factor that can determine an athlete's capacity to perform sustained exercise and is linked to aerobic endurance. VO2 max refers to the maximum amount of oxygen that an individual can utilize during intense or maximal exercise. It is measured as “milliliters of oxygen used in one minute per kilogram of body weight.” RPE refers to the rating of perceived exertion, wherein a visual analog scale was used to assess perceived fatigue (i.e., maximal exertion), at the end of the VO2 max. Lactate refers to blood Lactate levels. Lactate in the blood can be correlated with the accumulation level of lactic acid in muscle tissue. Results: In Table 4 and FIG. 48, “P” corresponds to control (non-electrokinetic beverage) group, and “R”: corresponds to the electrokinetic beverage test group. The results (see Table 4 below and FIG. 48) indicate that the beverage had an effect on all 3 parameters of exercise performance, and that the direction of the effect was favorable direction in all 3 areas (positive for VO2 max, negative for RPE (rating of perceived exertion) negative for lactate). The RPE had the most substantial shift, and is the most relevant factor for exercise performance. Documenting performance improvement is really the end point goal of all research in sports science. Measurements such as VO2, lactate, your lab tests results are mildly persuasive but performance data is what really moves athletes, coaches and sports scientists.

According to particular aspects, therefore, the present invention has substantial utility for enhancing exercise performance and recovery. In particular aspects, the present invention has substantial utility for maintaining, and in some aspects normalizing, a reduced oxygenated blood level in an animal subsequent to a blood oxygen-lowering effect activity, such as what typically occurs in an animal, such as a human, after an oxygen-consuming activity, such as exercise. Changes in these physiologically measurable parameters are typically attendant an increase in physical activity, stress or other fatigue-inducing event. In particular aspects, changes in heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood lactate, oxygen consumption, and fatigue assessment by a patient in response to a defined exercise regimen were favorably improved after consuming a defined quantity of the electrokinetically-altered fluids relative to control non-electrokinetically-altered fluid. In particular aspects, the present invention has substantial utility for inhibiting and/or delaying onset of fatigue in a human. In particular aspects, subjects consuming electrokinetically-altered oxygenated fluids have a lesser drop in oxygen saturation compared to subjects consuming electrokinetically-altered oxygenated fluids. In particular aspects, the present compositions and methods have substantial utility for inhibiting and/or reducing the increase in levels of blood lactate attendant human exercise, for reducing muscle soreness, and for reducing lactic acid accumulation in muscle. In particular aspects, the present compositions and methods have substantial utility for reducing and/or inhibiting the onset of fatigue in response to exercise in a human. In particular aspects, the present compositions and methods have substantial utility for increasing and/or replenishing available oxygen in the blood stream by consuming the oxygen-enriched nanostructured fluid preparations. Example 4 Consumption of the Disclosed Sports Beverage Altered Markers of Exercise Performance and Cardio-respiratory Fitness) Overview: Currently available beverages designed to boost performance contain additives that include electrolytes, proteins, carbohydrates, or caffeine. Disclosed herein is a novel approach providing a beverage that aims at protecting muscle cells through charge-stabilized nanostructures (CSN). CSN-containing solutions are generated through Applicants' proprietary process that involves Taylor-Couette-Poiseuille flow in the presence of oxygen. Applicants have previously demonstrated that RNS60, a saline therapeutic formulation, alters the cellular response to various stressors through effects on voltage-gated ion channels and potentially other voltage-sensing proteins. Voltage-gated ion channels tightly regulate skeletal muscle contraction and cardiac function, and maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max), a widely used measure of cardio-respiratory fitness, is in part determined by cardiac output. In this Example, Applicants investigated whether oral consumption of Applicants' Sports Beverage (RB), a water beverage processed in a similar manner to RNS60, would alter selected physiological responses during exercise. In a double blind, randomized, crossover study, RB consumption led to a 5% increase in VO2max in highly fit subjects and a decrease in the rating of perceived exertion in lesser-trained subjects. In addition, RB lowered the plasma levels of myoglobin and creatine kinase, two markers of the response to strenuous exercise, and attenuated exercise-induced circulating levels of several cytokines. Test and control fluids were as described in Example 3. According to particular aspects, therefore, ingesting RB (e.g., in days preceding strenuous exercise) improves performance and enhances training adaptation. Athletic performance is determined by many parameters that include age, genetics, training, and biomechanics. In addition, optimized diet and hydration are important factors in achieving and sustaining maximal performance. Beverages currently available in the market place aim at boosting performance by additives that include electrolytes, proteins, carbohydrates, or caffeine. Applicants have developed an innovative approach to athletic performance enhancement by providing fluid comprositions that protectsmuscle cells through charge-stabilized nanostructure (CSN) technology. As primary study endpoints, Applicants measured maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). VO2max has been linked to aerobic exercise performance, and while it is clear that VO2max alone is not a predictor of overall athletic performance, it is an important measure of cardio-respiratory fitness [2]. VO2max is influenced to a large extent by cardiac output, and cardiac function is controlled by a tightly regulated interplay of voltage-gated ion channels [3]. RPE is a subjective rating of physical exertion that is widely used as a general measure of physiological stress and the capability to sustain physical exercise [4]. In addition, Applicants measured plasma levels of myoglobin and plasma creatine kinase (CK), two routinely used markers of skeletal muscle damage [5]. Strenuous exercise has been shown to induce a cytokine response[6]. Among the cytokines released from skeletal muscle, interleukin-6 (IL-6) has been reported to undergo the most rapid and profound upregulation [6,7,8]. IL-6 has been suggested to induce an anti-inflammatory response that may be involved in preventing excessive tissue damage [9], but it has also been linked to general fatigue and underperformance syndrome (a.k.a. overtraining syndrome), a syndrome that is characterized by symptoms ranging from lack of performance improvement to signs of clinical depression [10,11]. In two independent treadmill exercise studies, plasma levels of IL-6 have been linked to VO2max and RPE: in the first study, IL-6 levels were inversely correlated with VO2max [12], whereas in the second, the lowering of plasma IL-6 levels induced by consumption of a carbohydrate beverage was associated with a lower RPE [13]. The response of other cytokines to exercise is less well studied. Circulating levels of soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L, CD154) have been reported to be lowered by ultra-endurance exercise in athletes [14] and moderate exercise in heart failure patients [15]. CD40 and its ligand are involved in inflammatory processes in atherosclerotic plaque and the development of arterial thrombi that cause myocardial infarction, and sCD40L was identified as a risk marker in patients with acute coronary syndrome [16]. Colony-stimulating factors including macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) have been shown to be upregulated in response to exercise [17], but the implications are unknown at this time. Based on the increasing recognition of exercise effects related to inflammatory processes, Applicants screened for changes in circulating levels of a comprehensive panel of cytokines using a Luminex 52-plex cytokine assay. Study Design Study participants were a blend of performance-oriented individuals and the general health-conscious population. Diet and activity levels were standardized prior to the testing, and subjects were instructed to consume a consistent diet throughout the entire study. For the 24-hour period preceding exercise testing, subjects were instructed to consume the same menu consisting of ˜60% carbohydrate, ˜15% protein and ˜25% fat. Subjects were allowed to drink and eat freely until their pre-exercise venous blood sampling was obtained; from that point on they consumed approximately 10 ounces plain water until beginning the exercise, and they did not consume anything during the 60-minute endurance sessions. Subjects were advised to refrain from long or hard workouts for 2 days prior to their VO2max test and throughout the trial weeks. They were also instructed to refrain from altering their training unless required to by the study design. The study was designed as a crossover study (FIG. 49). Study subjects were randomized to two groups. One group consumed 1.5 L of RB per day for 2 weeks, and after a washout period of 2 weeks consumed 1.5 L per day of placebo water (PW). The other group started with consumption of 1.5 L of PW for 2 weeks, and after the washout period continued with 1.5 L per day of RB. FIG. 49 shows a study design overview. Study subjects were randomized to 2 groups. Group 1 consumed 1.5 L of RB per day for 2 weeks, and after a washout period of 2 weeks consumed 1.5 L per day of PW. Group 2 started with consumption of 1.5 L of PW for 2 weeks, and after the washout period continued with 1.5 L per day of RB. Within each of the two beverage consumption periods, VO2max was determined on day 12 and an exercise testing was performed on day 15. VO2max measurements. On day 12 of beverage consumption, VO2max was determined according to the Modified Astrand protocol (variable 5-8 mph and increasing by 2.5% incline per stage). Subjects who required greater than 8 mph velocity used the Costill and Fox protocol (8-9 mph and increasing by 2% incline per stage). All tests were completed on Precor Treadmills under standard laboratory conditions of temperature (62-67° F.), pressure (700-715 mmHg) and relative humidity (30-40%). Prior to each test, the equipment was calibrated. The exercise protocol required subjects to complete a 10-minute self-paced warm-up before beginning the first stage of the test, which targeted an RPE of 11. Following a 3-minute first stage, the incline was increased every 2 minutes to the point of maximal effort. On completion of the test, final power output and VO2max were noted. 75% of the VO2max power output was calculated as a target for the exercise testing, which followed 3 days later. Exercise testing. Exercise testing was conducted on day 15 of beverage consumption. During each test, subjects ran continuously for 60 minutes at 75% VO2max on a level treadmill. Participants performed both exercises on the same treadmill and at the same pace. Blood samples were collected from the antecubital veins at three time intervals: immediately pre-exercise, 30 minutes into the exercise, just prior to completion of the exercise at 60 minutes, and 24 hours after completion of the exercise. For the sampling during the exercise, subjects slowed to a walk 3.0-3.5 mph for less than 3 minutes (average: 2.5 minutes) before returning to their running pace. The blood samples were used to measure complete blood count, complete metabolic profile, magnesium, calcium, phosphorous, myoglobin, lactic acid, creatine kinase (CK), and C-reactive protein (CRP). In addition, the plasma concentrations of a panel of cytokines were measured with a Luminex 52-plex cytokine assay. RPE was recorded according to the Modified Borg Scale at 15 and 50 minutes. Lactate measurements were obtained utilizing an Accusport Lactate Plus analyzer at the following times: pre-exercise, during exercise at 20, 30, and 40 minutes and at the conclusion of exercise at 60 minutes. Twenty four-hour urine collection for total volume, creatinine clearance, osmolarity, and urine electrolytes were collected prior to starting beverage, prior to exhaustive exercise and 24 hours after the exercise. Results and Discussion: RB consumption improved VO2max in experienced athletes. Twenty-five fit male subjects (age: 18-35 years) were randomly assigned to the study groups. The study groups comprised individuals with a regular training history as well as more sedentary individuals, with a mean VO2max of 53.4 mL/kg/min. A comparison of VO2max values within the entire study population did not reveal a difference between subjects receiving Applicants' Sports Beverage (RB) and subjects receiving normal, purified water (PW). However, when study subjects were analyzed based on their beginning fitness level, a 5% improvement in the subgroup with a VO2max above 60 mL/kg/min was observed (FIG. 50A). The difference did not reach statistical significance, likely due to the small number of subjects in this VO2max range (n=6). It is noteworthy, though, that 5 out of the 6 subjects showed an increase in VO2max (FIG. 2B). In study subjects with a VO2max below 60 mL/kg/min, there was no difference in VO2max between those who consumed RB and those who consumed PW (FIG. 2A). FIGS. 50 A and B show that RB consumption improves VO2max in fitter athletes. FIG. 50A. Data are presented as percent change in RB groups separated by a VO2max threshold of 60, compared to the corresponding PB groups (mean±SEM). FIG. 50B. Absolute VO2max values for the six study subjects with a VO2max>60 mL/kg/min. VO2max is defined by the Fick equation, VO2max=Q(CaO2−CvO2), where Q is cardiac output, CaO2 is the arterial oxygen content, and CvO2 is the venous oxygen content. VO2max, therefore, is to a large part dependent on cardiac output. In particular aspects, RB has the capacity to directly or indirectly alter cardiac ion channels. Other elements that influence VO2max are related to oxygen delivery, uptake, and utilization [2]. Pulmonary contribution is not usually a limiting factor; however, in some elite athletes, exercise-induced hypoxemia (EIH) can result from very high stroke volume and rapid pulmonary circulatory transit time, where hemoglobin does not pick up adequate oxygen due to insufficient time spent at the alveolar level [18,19]. Additionally, the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, which is determined by plasma volume, iron status, and hemoglobin levels, is an important component of oxygen delivery [20]. At the muscle level, capillary density and membrane diffusion contribute to oxygen delivery, and mitochondrial density as well as enzyme and substrate status determine oxygen utilization rate [20]. While VO2max is a trainable exercise parameter, it has been shown to have a genetic component, and among adults, high and low responders have been reported [21]. A 4.1% VO2max increase was reported for a group of elite athletes after an intensive 24-day “live high-train low” altitude training regimen [22], and in untrained subjects, training at 75% of aerobic power for 30 minutes, 3 times a week, over 6 months, was necessary to yield an average VO2max increase of 15-20% [23]. The 5% increase observed in the fitter athletes of our study represents a substantial improvement considering the short period of beverage consumption and the absence of a rigorous training program. While a high VO2max is required for competitive exercise performance, it is not the only determinant of the actual exercise performance. As an additional exercise response parameter, the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) was measured. RB consumption altered RPE. RPE was measured at time points of 15 and 50 minutes during the treadmill exercise. As expected, RPE increased over time (FIG. 51). After consumption of RB, the study participants showed a lower RPE when compared to PW consumption (FIG. 3); this was particularly apparent in the subgroup of participants with a VO2max <60 mL/kg/min (FIG. 3). The more highly trained subgroup likely operated on a lower RPE level compared to the lesser trained subgroup (12.5±1.5 vs. 14.8±0.3, p=0.02) and therefore may not have benefitted as much from the effect of RB. FIG. 51 shows that RB consumption decreases RPE. RPE was recorded utilizing a Modified Borg Scale at 15 and 50 minutes during the performance exercise. The data are presented separated by a VO2max-threshold of 60 mg/kg/min. A lowered RPE means that an individual can complete a given exercise with a lower level of perceived exertion, or exercise longer until exhaustion is reached, and therefore indicates a potentially beneficial training response. Crossover study artifacts. When analyzing the data from the second exercise trial, Applicants noticed that the subjects in the PW group of this trial (group 1 in FIG. 49) behaved more like they had in the first trial, when they consumed RB, than the PW group of the first trial (data not shown). This phenomenon was independent of the subjects' VO2max. An adaptation to training as the underlying reason is not likely in such a short time frame. One possible explanation is that the washout period between the two trials was not sufficient to “reset” changes introduced by previous RB consumption. To avoid skewed data based on an insufficient washout, we excluded study group 1 (RB first) from further analysis and instead analyzed group 2 (PW first) only. All data shown below therefore represent the paired analysis of group 2 individuals consuming PW in trial 1 and RB in trial 2. RB consumption lowered plasma myoglobin and CK levels. When the study subjects consumed PW, circulating myoglobin levels increased during exercise, peaking at a 2.8-fold elevation (absolute mean increase: 73 ng/mL) by the end of the exercise. When the subjects consumed RB, however, myoglobin levels did not rise above pre-exercise values (FIG. 52). CK levels increased more slowly when compared to myoglobin, which is in agreement with published reports [5]. The highest increase in plasma CK (1.9-fold, absolute mean increase: 202 units/L) was present 24 hours after the endurance trial when the subjects had consumed PW. RB consumption attenuated the elevation of plasma CK levels at the 60-minute and 24 h-hour time points in a statistically significant manner (FIG. 52). FIG. 52 shows time point differences in levels of plasma myoglobin. Data are presented as differences (mean±SEM) between two time points as indicated by the labels of the x-axis. D0=day before start of beverage consumption, PE=time point immediately prior to starting the endurance exercise, 30 min=30-minute time point of endurance exercise, 60 min=60-minute time point of endurance exercise (end of exercise), 24 h=24 hours after completion of the exercise. P-values were calculated by Wilcoxon signed rank test. FIG. 53 shows time point differences in plasma CK levels. Data are presented as differences (mean±SEM) between two time points as indicated by the labels of the x-axis. D0=day before start of beverage consumption, PE=time point immediately prior to starting the endurance exercise, 30 min=30-minute time point of endurance exercise, 60 min=60-minute time point of endurance exercise (end of exercise), 24 h=24 hours after completion of the exercise. P-values were calculated by Wilcoxon signed rank test. According to particular aspects, therefore, the reduction of plasma myoglobin and CK levels indicates that muscle damage after exercise is attenuated by drinking RB. Effects of RB consumption on plasma cytokine levels. IL-6. Across all study groups, circulating levels of IL-6 were low, with a modest maximal increase of ˜2-fold, from 3.97±7.79 (SD) pg/mL before the exercise to 8.30±8.14 (SD) pg/mL by the end of the exercise (p<0.0001). While others have reported post-exercise IL-6 levels to increase up to 100-fold [24], higher exercise levels and/or longer exercise durations are typically needed to achieve an increase of this magnitude. In several published studies, for example, running for a period of 2-3 hours was associated with maximal IL-6 levels in the range of 40 pg/mL to 120 pg/mL [7,13,25]. Applicants did not measure significant differences in plasma IL-6 levels between consumption of RB and consumption of PW (data not shown). Consumption of a 6% carbohydrate beverage was reported by others to decrease circulating IL-6 levels in marathon runners [13]; compared to Applicants' study, however, this effect was observed after a longer exercise duration (2.5 hours) and with IL-6 levels in a higher concentration range (50-75 pg/mL) [13]. Both, the increase of IL-6 after prolonged exercise and the lowering achieved by consumption of a carbohydrate-containing beverage, are in agreement with the fact that IL-6 production is induced in glycogen-depleted skeletal muscle [26,27]. IFN-α, ENA-78, and M-CSF. Two pro-inflammatory cytokines that displayed reduced plasma concentrations when study subjects consumed RB were interferon-α (IFN-α) and epithelial neutrophil activating protein 78 (ENA-78) (FIG. 54). FIG. 54 shows that RB inhibited the exercise-induced increase of plasma levels of IFN-α (A) and ENA-78 (B). Data are presented as differences (mean±SEM) between two time points as indicated by the labels of the x-axis. D0=day before start of beverage consumption, PE=time point immediately prior to starting the endurance exercise, 30 min=30-minute time point of endurance exercise, 60 min=60-minute time point of endurance exercise (end of exercise), 24 h=24 hours after completion of the exercise. P-values were calculated by Wilcoxon signed rank test. Both cytokines increased 24 hours after completion of the exercise trial that was performed after 2 weeks of PW consumption; however, this increase was absent when the subjects had consumed RB (FIG. 6). IFN-α is a cytokine with a broad range of anti-proliferative activities [28]. Similar to IL-6, elevated levels of IFN-α have been linked to fatigue and depression [29,30]. Because IFN-α induces IL-6 [31], these effects of IFN-α may in part be caused indirectly. ENA-78 is a chemokine of the IL-8 family that has similar effects to the ubiquitous IL-8: it attracts neutrophils and thereby promotes inflammation [32]. Elevated ENA-78 levels are found in blood and synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients and have been associated with disease progression in Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, acute appendicitis and chronic pancreatitis [32]. ENA-78 expression has been shown to increase in injured skeletal muscle [33], and the inhibition of plasma ENA-78 by RB therefore is consistent with the protective effective suggested by the myoglobin and CK data. M-CSF, IFN-α, and ENA-78 showed the same trend: increased plasma levels in the subjects consuming PW at the 24-hour time point that were blunted in subjects receiving RB (data not shown). Absolute M-CSF levels, however, were below the limit of detection in a high proportion of samples. BDNF. Plasma levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were markedly increased 24 hours after the completion of the exercise trial when the study subjects had consumed PW (FIG. 6). RB consumption abolished the post-exercise BDNF peak (FIG. 55). FIG. 55 shows that RB consumption prevents the rise in BDNF plasma concentration 24 hours after the exercise trial. Data are presented as differences (mean±SEM) between two time points, as indicated by the labels of the x-axis. D0=day before start of beverage consumption, PE=time point immediately prior to starting the endurance exercise, 30 min=30-minute time point of endurance exercise, 60 min=60-minute time point of endurance exercise (end of exercise), 24 h=24 hours after completion of the exercise. P-values was calculated by Wilcoxon signed rank test. BDNF is a member of the neurotrophin family that is expressed at high levels in the brain and in the peripheral nervous system [34]. BDNF has diverse effects on neuronal cells, including growth, differentiation, and repair [34], and has been suggested to be a pro-angiogenic factor in ischemic tissue [35]. BDNF has also been reported to act as a natural anti-depressant [36,37] and has been associated with the beneficial effects of exercise on memory function and depression [38,39]. In contrast to these positive effects, high BDNF expression in coronary arteries has been found in patients with heart disease and has been suggested to contribute to plaque instability and unstable angina [40]. How to interpret the reduction of BDNF after RB consumption in our study is not clear at present. Of note, however, the study subjects with the highest plasma concentrations of BDNF also had the highest concentrations of ENA-78 (data not shown). One might speculate that post-exercise increases in BDNF, could be linked to the increase of pro-inflammatory factors such as ENA-78 in a similar fashion to the one that has been hypothesized for IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β [9]. In other words, the presence of factors that counteract a damage response may not be needed if the damaging factors are not released in the first place. sCD40L. In contrast to IFN-α, ENA-78, and BDNF, all of which showed increased plasma levels 24 hours after exercise, sCD40L showed a difference at earlier time points that was lost later on (FIG. 56). While sCD40L levels increased from the pre-exercise time point to 30 minutes into the exercise when the subjects consumed PW, they decreased when the subjects drank RB (FIG. 56). Absolute plasma concentrations, however, were not significantly different between both experimental conditions (data not shown). FIG. 56 shows the effect of RB consumption on circulating sCD40L levels. Data are presented as differences (mean±SEM) between two time points, as indicated by the labels of the x-axis. D0=day before start of beverage consumption, PE=time point immediately prior to starting the endurance exercise, 30 min=30-minute time point of endurance exercise, 60 min=60-minute time point of endurance exercise (end of exercise), 24 h=24 hours after completion of the exercise. P-values were calculated by Wilcoxon signed rank test. In summary of this Example. According to particular aspects, Applicants' Sports Beverage (RB) favorably alters the response to exercise. The study demonstrated promising trends caused by RB consumption. Most importantly, VO2max appeared to be elevated in highly fit subjects, whereas lesser-trained subjects showed a trend towards a lower RPE. At the same time, plasma myoglobin and CK, two markers of muscle damage, were lower across both study subgroups. References cited in this Example: 1.

Example 5 Beneficial Effects of Electrokinetically Processed Fluids on Human Exercise Performance and/or Recovery Following Intense Exercise Overview: Exercise-induce muscle damage in humans is widely recognized in the art (see, e.g., Clarkson & Hubal, Am. J. Phys. Med. Rehabil. 81:S52-S69, incorporated by reference herein for its teachings on exercise-induce muscle damage). According to particular aspects, a blinded (e.g., double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-arm trial) exercise performance and recovery test is conducted (e.g., to test the effects on extent of muscle fiber micro-injury and recovery), using electrokinetically-altered purified water (test fluid), characterizing that the disclosed electrokinetically-processed fluids have substantial utility for preventing tissue damage and/or enhancing tissue and/or physiological recovery after intense exercise, including preventing muscle and/or tendon damage and/or enhancing/facilitating muscle and/or tendon recovery from exercise (e.g., eccentric exercise), particularly from intense exercise. Materials: Electrokinetically-altered purified water (test fluid) processed as previously described (see also US2008/02190088 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,832,920), US2008/0281001 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,919,534); US2010/0038244, WO2008/052143, incorporated by reference herein in their entirety for their respective teachings on processing and properties of electrokinetically-altered fluids) is used. The control (negative control fluid) is the corresponding non-electrokinetically-processed purified water. Preferred route of administration is oral. Methods: An art-recognized arm-curl model (see, e.g., Borsa & Sauers, Med Sci Sports Exerc 32(5): 891-896, 2000; and Borsa & Liggett J Athl Train 33(2): 150-155, 1998; see also McHugh et al., Sports Med. 27:157-170, 1999, all incorporated herein by reference for their teachings on eccentric exercise models and related measurements) comprising eccentric exercise to the bicep brachii muscle, is used for inducing skeletal muscle soreness and dysfunction in human subjects using eccentric exercise. The extent of muscle damage and recovery (e.g., the effects on extent of muscle fiber micro-injury and recovery) is determined by analysis of serum biological markers of muscle damage and/or recovery. In particular aspects, the exercise comprises a single bout of enhanced eccentric exercise. In certain aspects, muscle microinjury is measured. For, example, a concentric/eccentric isokinetic exercise protocol for the biceps brachii muscle is used to induce muscle microinjury (e.g., extent of muscle fiber micro-injury and recovery). As a result of this exercise, subjects will display similar signs and symptoms associated with a mild, sport-related musculotendinous injury. In certain aspects, exercise is performed on a Kin-Com 500-H dynamometer (Chattecx Corp.). The subject (e.g., male and female adults between the ages of 18-35 years are included if they are healthy, non-smoking, and free of nutritional or dietary supplements for a minimum of six weeks) is seated and stabilized the same as for typical force measurements. In certain aspects, the angular velocity is set at 30° s−1 for concentric actions, and 60° s−1 for eccentric actions. In particular aspects, the range of motion for the exercise is preset at 45-110° of elbow flexion. Subjects are seated and the elbow aligned with the axis of rotation of the dynamometer. Subjects typically use their nondominant arm for testing. Each subject performs near-maximal concentric and eccentric actions consisting of 10 sets of 5 repetitions with a 30-s recovery period between sets. In certain aspects, peak force production is measured, for example, using a Kin-Com 500-H dynamometer (Chattecx Corp., Chattanooga, Tenn.). Peak force production is the maximal voluntary isometric force produced during a muscle action. Subjects are typically seated with their nondominant arm placed at their side in 90° elbow flexion, neutral rotation of humerus, and supination of the forearm. In certain aspects, each subject performs a plurality (e.g., three) of maximal voluntary isometric actions held, for example, for 2.5 seconds. The average of the values is recorded as peak force in Newtons (N). The mid-range position is used as the reference angle because of the length-tension relationship. The length-tension relationship is recognized as demonstrating that maximal tension is generated at the mid-range of elbow joint flexion due to optimal available sarcomere cross-bridging. Test/retest reliability is demonstrated. According to additional aspects, the peak rate of force production is the steepest point on the slope of the force-time curve, and represents the muscle's ability to rapidly generate force or tension (N s−1). To calculate this value, raw data from the force-time curve is typically reduced and displayed using an executable program (e.g., Visual Basic 4.0), and test/retest reliability is demonstrated. In certain aspects, pain perception and muscle dysfunction are assessed as indicators of microinjury. Pain perception is, for example, assessed using an art-recognized visual analog scale (VAS). The use of a VAS is known in the art to be a reliable and valid method of quantifying pain perception. In certain aspects, the VAS consists of a horizontal line (e.g., 10 cm in length) with 0 at the extreme left representing “no pain” and 10 cm on the extreme right representing “pain as bad as it possibly could be” for the biceps brachii muscle. Each subject is then asked to draw a vertical line at the point that most accurately corresponds to their perceived level of pain with active flexion and extension of their involved arm. In certain aspects, pain-free active range of motion (ROM) is used as a measure of dysfunction. A standard, plastic goniometer may be used to assess ROM for elbow flexion and extension. The goniometer approximats the axis of rotation for the ulnohumeral joint and bisects the humerus and forearm. Extension is typically measured with the subject seated and their arm resting pain free at their side). For flexion, subjects are asked to flex their elbow to the point just before discomfort. This process is repeated, for example, twice for both flexion and extension and the average score is recorded in degrees (°). The criterion measure for pain-free ROM is calculated by subtracting the extension score from the flexion score. Both measures are recorded and analyzed separately before and after the exercise induced microinjury protocol. For statistical treatment, pre- and post-injury data for pain perception and dysfunction are analyzed, for example, using a one-way ANOVA with repeated measures. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and standard error of measurements (SEMS) are calculated for the force measures. Repeated measures are performed for each dependent variable and the ICC is obtained from analysis of variance taking into account the between-subjects mean square, error mean square, trial mean square, number of trials, and number of subjects. Exemplary detailed study design. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, two-arm trial is designed to investigate the protective effects of the test beverage (test bev.) compared to control/placebo (non electrokinetically processed) beverage on and muscle function following a single bout of enhanced eccentric exercise. Subjects (e.g., male and female adults between the ages of 18-35 years are included if they are healthy, non-smoking, and free of nutritional or dietary supplements for a minimum of six weeks) are randomly assigned to either a test beverage group (n=20) or placebo control group (n=20). The effects of the test bev. are compared to the placebo control. Subjects are required to complete a 21-day supplement trial spanning pre-supplement baseline testing, a controlled water beverage supplementation regimen, pre-exercise baseline testing, eccentric arm exercise to induce muscle damage, and planned follow-up post-exercise data collection time points. A “between subjects two-arm trial design” is preferably chosen over a “within-subjects cross-over design” in order to prevent the influence of confounds due to repeated bout effects. The repeated bout effect is a phenomenon characterized by less muscle damage, inflammation, delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS) and strength deficits after the second of 2 separate eccentric exercise bouts performed in close proximity usually within days to weeks. Study population. Inclusion/Exclusion criteria: male and female adults between the ages of 18-35 years are included if they are healthy, non-smoking, and free of nutritional or dietary supplements for a minimum of six weeks. Supplements include but are not limited to ephedra, yohimbine, pro-hormones, creatine or anabolics. Subjects are excluded if they have been involved in a regular weight-training program within the last six weeks, have a prior history of injury to the neck, shoulder or elbow region of the non-dominant arm, recent history of a bacterial infection or current reported use of anti-inflammatory medication within the last 6 weeks. Test article and dosing. The test beverage and placebo are packaged in 500-ml plastic bottles, and subjects are instructed to consume a prescribed dose of the beverage (bottles/day) based on the following body weight categories. For example, <130 lb=2 bottles/day; 130-160 lb=3 b/d; 160-190 lb=4 b/d; 190-220 lb=5 b/d; >220 lb=6 b/d. Blood biomarker measures. Assays are used to track serum levels for biomarkers of muscle damage (e.g., creatine kinase (CK)]) and inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)) and/or other cytokines or markers as appropriate. Functional measures. Isometric muscle strength (peak force production) is used as a measure of overall arm function. Symptoms and impairments are measured using pressure pain ratings (algometer) and self-report functional questionnaires. Blood collection. Blood samples are collected via venipuncture in the early morning (between 7-10 am) after a 10-hr fast. Phlebotomy-trained personnel complete all blood draws. After separation, all specimens are aliquoted into the appropriate number of cryovials based on the proposed number of assays. Blood is taken from the antecubital vein and collected into two 10 mL Vacutainer® tubes containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K3EDTA; 8.4 mg/Vacutainer®) or into two 10 mL serum collection tubes. Since various biochemical assays require different blood collection procedures, two 10 mL Vacutainer® containing either sodium citrate (3.2%, 0.109M) and sodium heparin are collected. Blood is centrifuged at 4° C. at 1500×g for five minutes. For some analyses, plasma is allocated to storage tubes containing 100 μM butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), Trolox (100 μM) and 100 μM diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). DTPA serves as a metal chelator, and BHT acts as a chain-breaking antioxidant to prevent lipid peroxidation ex vivo. Samples are stored immediately at −80° C. in multiple aliquots (6 to 8). Samples stored in multiple aliquots (˜0.25 mL) are thawed only once and immediately analyzed for a specific biomarker (samples subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle, may show increases in baseline lipid peroxidation products). Cryovial labels are color coded by study and include the subject ID number, date, visit number (specific per study), and cryovial number. Each sample is logged into an Excel spreadsheet by a lab technician and frozen at −80° C. in locked freezers connected to an emergency power supply and an alarm system. Visit 1 (Baseline measurements, day 0). Report to lab at assigned meeting time. A signed informed consent is obtained prior to any testing. The following procedures are performed: brief medical screen (height, weight, pulse, blood pressure and body temperature), blood draw, subjective evaluation of arm function, muscle point tenderness, and isometric strength measures. Body temperature is measured to ensure that the subject is not running a fever. Subjects are instructed to maintain current activity levels and not to initiate a resistance-training or weight-loss program for the duration of the study. Subjects are randomly assigned to a group (test beverage/placebo) and instructed to consume the test beverage (or placebo), which is dispensed for the next 18 days. A pre-exercise visit is scheduled for 10 days later. All pre-exercise and follow-up measurements are compared with baseline measures. Visit 2 (pre-exercise measurements, eccentric exercise protocol, day 10). Report to lab at assigned meeting time. The following procedures are performed: brief medical screen (height, weight, pulse, blood pressure and body temperature), blood draw, subjective evaluation of arm function, muscle point tenderness, and isometric strength measures. Subjects then undergo a standardized single bout of eccentric resistance exercise to the non-dominant biceps brachii muscle. A standard arm-curl machine (Cybex International, Inc., Medway, Mass.) is used for the eccentric exercise protocol. Exercise weights for each subject re determined by establishing their one repetition maximum (1-RM) concentric or shortening contraction. The 1-RM is determined by having the subject perform a concentric arm curl against a low resistance with continued repetitions being performed with weight being incrementally added until a 1-RM is reached. Each subject then performs five sets of ten repetitions of lengthening contractions on the arm curl machine using a weight equivalent to 140% of their 1-RM. Each repetition takes 4-6 seconds to ensure maximal tension is being applied to the muscle. Subjects are given a one-minute rest period between sets. Exercise is not performed in the usual way (concentric)—meaning shortening of muscles during contraction. It is rather performed eccentrically—lengthening the muscle while still developing tension (overload). The angular velocity will be set at 45°/sec for concentric and 60°/sec for eccentric actions. Subjects will be given a one-minute rest period between sets. The exercise session takes less than 10 minutes. Visits 3-5 are scheduled for follow-up measurements. Precautionary measures are taken to prevent and monitor adverse reactions to the exercise protocol. Follow-up visits (e.g., day 19, 20 and 21) are scheduled post-exercise. Data analysis. Data are analyzed using a two way ANOVA with repeated measures on the second factor (time). Outcome measures are analyzed using a two (group) by four (time) ANOVA. Statistical significance is set at p<0.05. If significant interactions occur, the Tukey post-hoc test is used to reveal where the differences occur. All data analyses are performed using SPSS→ for Windows 16.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill.). Results: According to particular aspects, the electrokinetically-processed fluids have substantial utility for preventing or alleviating/reducing tissue damage and/or enhancing tissue and/or physiological recovery after intense exercise, including preventing muscle damage and/or enhancing/facilitating muscle recovery from exercise (e.g., eccentric exercise), particularly from intense exercise. In certain embodimens, the electrokinetically-processed fluids have substantial utility for preventing or alleviating/reducing the extent of muscle fiber micro-injury, and/or enhancing recovery thereof. According to particular aspects, the electrokinetically-processed fluids have substantial utility for reducing biomarkers of exercise-induced muscle injury (e.g., creatine kinase (CK)). According to additional aspects, the electrokinetically-processed fluids have substantial utility for reducing subjective ratings of muscle soreness. According to yet additional aspects, the electrokinetically-processed fluids have substantial utility for preserving muscle contractile function (e.g., maximal force, joint ROM). According to yet additional aspects, the electrokinetically-processed fluids have substantial utility for preventing and/or ameliorating/reducing exercise-induced tendon damage and/or enhancing/facilitating tendon recovery from exercise and/or exercise-induced damage (e.g., eccentric exercise, tendinosis, tendonitis, tenosynovitis), particularly from intense exercise, and/or reducing exercise-induced tendon-related pain and/or swelling. In certain aspects at least one of peroneal tendon, flexor tendon, Achilles tendon is treated. According to yet additional aspects, the electrokinetically-processed fluids have substantial utility for preventing and/or ameliorating/reducing and/or enhancing recovery from tendon strain associated with chronic, repetitive movement, comprising administration, to a subject in need thereof, a electrokinetically-altered sports beverage composition as disclosed herein in an amount sufficient to prevent and/or ameliorate and/or enhance recovery from tendon strain associated with chronic, repetitive movement. According to further aspects, and as demonstrated in Example 3 above and in this Example 4, the electrokinetically-processed fluids have substantial utility for improving exercise performance. 1.
