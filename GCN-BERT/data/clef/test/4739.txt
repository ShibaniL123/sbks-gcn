BACKGROUND 1. Field The present invention relates generally to novel structures of proteasome inhibitors and methods for synthesizing and use thereof. More particularly, the present invention relates to novel structures of proteasome inhibitors, such as syrbactins and its analogs, and methods for synthesizing them and using them for effective proteasome inhibition. 2. Description of Related Art Proteasome inhibitors, unlike other therapeutic compositions, are a class of promising inhibitors that distinguish between cancerous and normal cells. In other words, proteasome inhibitors appear to be more effective and active in cancer cells compared to normal cells. More than cancer, proteasome inhibitors are also effective in treatment of other diseases and pathological conditions. A wide range of cellular substrates and processes are controlled by or affected by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. As a result, the ability of natural products and other compounds to act as proteasome inhibitors has attracted significant interest. SUMMARY Intracellular protein turnover is crucial to maintenance of normal cellular homeostasis. Proteasome inhibitors are thought of as potential drug candidates due to their ability to induce programmed cell death, preferentially, in transformed cells (as compared to normal cells). The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has emerged as a primary target for cancer therapy and led to the approval of one of the first protesome inhibitors, bortezomib, for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. However, there still exist problems with patients developing refractoriness to such drugs as well as development of bortezomib-resistant (or other proteasome inhibitors) disease and possibly in a broader spectrum of diseases. As such, new proteasome inhibitor compositions are needed to continue to provide clinically valuable control of various diseases in which proteasome inhibitions leads to therapeutic efficacy.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Proteasome inhibitors represent are a class of inhibitors with a wide variety of potential clinical applications, such as, for example, the treatment of cancer and many other pathological and autoinflammatory diseases. By way of example, proteasome inhibitors induce multiple myeloma (MM) cell apoptosis. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of the bone marrow which causes cancerous plasma cells to uncontrollably grow and create tumors in multiple sites. Normally, plasma cells account for less than five percent of the cells in bone marrow. In those individuals, who suffer from MM, however, plasma cells account for anywhere from ten percent to more than ninety percent of the cells in the bone marrow. Over time, the abnormal cells can permeate the interior of the bone and erode the bone cortex (outer layer). These weakened bones are more susceptible to bone fractures, especially in the spine, skull, ribs, and pelvis. The annual incidence of MM is approximately 4 per 100,000 people, and the condition is particularly common in the elderly population with a median age of 65 years; only 3% of patients with MM are less than 40 years old. Proteasome inhibitors are believed to be effective in the treatment of MM because they inducing a stress response in MM cells contributing to apoptosis. Proteasomes (also referred to as multicatalytic protease (MCP), multicatalytic proteinase, multicatalytic proteinase complex, multicatalytic endopeptidase complex, 20S, 26S, or ingensin) are a large, multiprotein complex present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of all eukaryotic cells. It is a highly conserved cellular structure that is responsible for the ATP-dependent proteolysis of most cellular protein. The 26S proteasome consists of a 20S core catalytic complex that is capped at each end by a 19S regulatory subunit. The 26S proteasome is able to degrade proteins that have been marked by the addition of ubiquitin molecules. Proteasome inhibitors, in particular those in accordance with the compositions and methods disclosed herein, which inhibit proteasome activity, may arrest or delay cancer progression by interfering with the ordered degradation of cell cycle proteins and/or tumor suppressors. Bortezomib, also known as PS-341 or [(1R)-3-methyl-1-({(2S)-3-phenyl-2-[(pyrazin-2-ylcarbonyl)amino]propanoyl-}amino)butyl]boronic acid, is a boronic acid dipeptide proteasome inhibitor that has shown anti-tumor activity both in vitro and in clinical trials involving MM patients. In addition to bortezomib, other proteasome inhibitors are also known. For example, a group of novel boronic acid proteasome inhibitors, including the compound known as CEP-18770. CEP-18770, whose chemical name is [(1R)-1-[[(2S,3R)-3-hydroxy-246-phenyl-pyridine-2-carbonyl)amino]-1-oxobutyl]amino]-3-methylbutylboronic acid, have been shown to be orally active and have a favorable tumor selectivity profile for the treatment of MM and other malignancies responsive to proteasome inhibition. Unfortunately, use of prolonged Bortezomib therapy or treatment using novel boronic acid proteasome inhibitors can lead to drug resistance in patients. In other words, although patients may initially respond to chemotherapy and/or steroids, most ultimately suffer from the disease when it has become resistant to treatment. As a result, for patients who progress after primary chemotherapy, which may also involve autologous stem cell transplantation, further chemotherapy is generally of limited benefit. Overall, the results of conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, at least to date, for MM suggests that a plateau is reached and patients become refractory to treatment. Furthermore, drug compositions currently employed during treatment offer core structures without an appreciable diversity in the side chains. As a result, a limited pool of proteasome inhibiting compositions are current available to carry out drug development for cancer and other malignancies. What is, therefore, needed are alternative treatment options that can offer the best long-term outcome for cancer (e.g., MM) patients and those that suffer from other malignancies. The need is especially urgent for novel therapies for patients with relapsed or refractory disease and who are typically more symptomatic and may be older with potential comorbidities and are especially challenging to treat. Accordingly, several embodiments disclosed herein provide for chemical structures that (i) modify the core structure in order to increase the reactivity of certain active portions of the core, (ii) modify the core structure to promote steric interaction with the target proteasome (or subunit thereof) and/or (iii) modify the ligand (e.g., the tail) structure and/or position to enhance the interaction of the compound with the target proteasome (or subunit thereof). Surprisingly, in several embodiments, these alterations lead to increased potency, therapeutic efficacy, specificity, and/or reduced side effects. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention. It will be apparent, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention is practiced without limitation to some or all of these specific details. In other instances, well-known process steps have not been described in detail in order to not unnecessarily obscure the invention. As used herein, a the term “subject” shall be given its ordinary meaning and shall also include any organism, including an animal, for which diagnosis, screening, monitoring or treatment is contemplated. Animals include mammals such as primates and domesticated animals. In several embodiments, the primate is a human. A patient refers to a subject such as a mammal, primate, human or livestock subject afflicted with a disease condition or for which a disease condition is to be determined or risk of a disease condition is to be determined. As used herein, the term “cancer” and “cancerous” shall be given their ordinary meanings and shall also refer to or describe the physiological condition in mammals that is typically characterized by unregulated cell growth. Examples of cancer include, but are not limited to, carcinoma, lymphoma, sarcoma, blastoma and leukemia. More particular examples of such cancers include squamous cell carcinoma, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer, bladder cancer, hepatoma, breast cancer, colon carcinoma, head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer and neuroblastoma. While the term “cancer” as used herein is not limited to any one specific form of the disease, it is believed that the methods of the invention can be effective for cancers which are found to be blood-related cancers and those cancers in which solid tumors form, including, but not limited to, multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma and leukemias. Additionally, cancerous tissues that can be treated with the compositions disclosed herein include, but are not limited to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), adrenocortical carcinoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, gastrointestinal cancer, appendix cancer, central nervous system cancer, basal cell carcinoma, bile duct cancer, bladder cancer, bone cancer, brain tumors (including but not limited to astrocytomas, spinal cord tumors, brain stem glioma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoblastoma, ependymoma, medulloblastoma, medulloepithelioma, breast cancer, bronchial tumors, Burkitt's lymphoma, cervical cancer, colon cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), chronic myeloproliferative disorders, ductal carcinoma, endometrial cancer, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, hairy cell leukemia, renal cell cancer, leukemia, oral cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, ocular cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, pituitary cancer, uterine cancer, and vaginal cancer.

Pub. No. 2010/0267070 A1 to Bachmann et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In embodiments of the invention, the compounds of the invention can be administered as the sole active agent, they can also be used in combination with one or more compounds of the invention or other agents. When administered as a combination, the therapeutic agents can be formulated as separate compositions that are administered at the same time or sequentially at different times, or the therapeutic agents can be given as a single composition. The phrase “co-therapy” (or “combination-therapy”), in defining use of a compound disclosed herein with at least one other pharmaceutical agent, is intended to embrace administration of each agent in a sequential manner in a regimen that will provide beneficial effects of the drug combination, and is intended as well to embrace co-administration of these agents in a substantially simultaneous manner, such as in a single dose having a fixed ratio of these active agents or in multiple, separate doses for each agent. Specifically, the administration of the compounds disclosed herein can be in conjunction with additional therapies known to those skilled in the art in the prevention or treatment of neoplastic disease, such as with radiation therapy or with cytostatic or cytotoxic agents. Standard treatment of primary tumors can consist of surgical excision followed by either radiation or intravenously (IV) administered chemotherapy. The typical chemotherapy regime consists of either DNA alkylating agents, DNA intercalating agents, CDK inhibitors, or microtubule poisons. The chemotherapy doses used are just below the maximal tolerated dose and therefore dose limiting toxicities typically include, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, neutropenia and the like. A large number of antineoplastic agents is available in commercial use, in clinical evaluation and in pre-clinical development, which can be selected for treatment of neoplastic disease by combination drug chemotherapy.
