3,7-Dimethyl-1-(3-(2-oxooxazolidin-3-yl)propyl)-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione
Sodium hydride (27.6 mg, 0.690 mmol) was added to a solution of oxazolidin-2-one (60.0 mg, 0.690 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (1 mL) at 0°C. The reaction solution was stirred at 20°C for 1 hour. A solution of 1-(3-iodopropyl)-3,7-dimethyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione in N,N-dimethylformamide (1 mL) was added dropwise to the reaction solution at 0°C. The reaction solution was stirred at 20°C for 12 hours and then cooled to 0°C. The reaction was quenched by addition of saturated ammonium chloride solution (100 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL x 3). The organic phases were combined and washed with brine (30 mL x 3), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. 3,7-Dimethyl-1-(3-(2-oxooxazolidin-3-yl)propyl)-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (50.0 mg) was obtained after purification by preparative HPLC with a yield of 28%.
