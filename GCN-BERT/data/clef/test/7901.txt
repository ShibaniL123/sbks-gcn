In some embodiments, Form J can be characterized by a DSC thermogram showing a first endotherm in the range of about 121 °C to about 127 °C (for example, at about 126 °C), an exotherm in the range of about 127 °C to about 132 °C (for example, at about 129 °C), and a second endotherm in the range of about 135 °C to about 142 °C (for example, at about 138 °C). [0024] In some embodiments, compound (Β) can be dosed in an amount in the range of about 40 mg to about 80 mg. In some embodiments, compound (Β) can be dosed in an amount in the range of about 50 mg to about 70 mg. In some embodiments, compound (Β) can be dosed in an amount of about 60 mg. As with compound (A), the timing and route of administration of compound (Β) can vary. In some embodiments, compound (Β) can be dosed once daily.

[0026] Various lengths of the treatment can exist for a combination described herein (for example, compound (A) compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing). In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be provided for less than 24 weeks. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be provided for less than 48 weeks. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be provided for about 12 weeks. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be provided in the range of 12 weeks to 24 weeks. [0027] Any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, pills, powders, granules, emulsions, microemulsions, suspensions (e.g., aqueous suspensions), syrups, elixirs, or solutions can be used to provide compound (A) and compound (Β), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing. Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules (for example, soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules), tablets, pills, powders, and granules. The oral dosage forms can be prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art and may contain additional materials such as pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s) or carrier(s). [0028] Combination of pegylated interferon plus ribavirin is the current standard of care for a HCV infection. This treatment does not provide sustained viral response (SVR) in a majority of subjects infected with the most prevalent genotype (la and lb). Furthermore, significant side effects prevent compliance to the current regimen and may require dose reduction or discontinuation in some subjects. [0029] The standard of care (SOC) for the treatment of F1CV infection comprises a 48-week administration of a combination of pegylated interferon-a (subcutaneous weekly injection) and ribavirin (oral, twice daily). The SOC therapy is poorly tolerated and ultimately successful in less than half of the treated subject population. Accordingly, there is a need for the continued development of treatment regimes. [0030] There are a variety of genotypes of HCV, and a variety of subtypes within each genotype. For example, at present it is known that there are eleven (numbered 1 through 11) main genotypes of F1CV, although others have classified the genotypes as 6 main genotypes. Each of these genotypes is further subdivided into subtypes (la-lc; 2a-2c; 3a-3b; 4a-4e; 5a; 6a; 7a- 7b; 8a-8b; 9a; 10a; and 11a). In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be effective to treat at least one genotype of HCV. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be effective to treat all 11 genotypes of HCV. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be effective to treat 3 or more, 5 or more, 7 or more of 9 more genotypes of HCV. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be more effective against a larger number of HCV genotypes than the standard of care. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be more effective against a particular HCV genotype than the standard of care (such as genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and/or 6). In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be effective to ameliorate and/or treat genotype selected from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be effective to ameliorate and/or treat genotype 1. In other embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be effective to ameliorate and/or treat genotype 2. In still other embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be effective to ameliorate and/or treat genotype 3. In yet still other embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be effective to ameliorate and/or treat genotype 4. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be effective to ameliorate and/or treat genotype 5. In other embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be effective to ameliorate and/or treat genotype 6. In still other embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be effective to ameliorate and/or treat genotype la. [0031] Various indicators for determining the effectiveness of a method for treating a HCV infection are known to those skilled in the art. Example of suitable indicators include, but are not limited to, a reduction in viral load, a reduction in viral replication, a reduction in time to seroconversion (virus undetectable in subject serum), an increase in the rate of sustained viral response to therapy, a reduction of morbidity or mortality in clinical outcomes, a reduction in the rate of liver function decrease, stasis in liver function, improvement in liver function, reduction in one or more markers of liver dysfunction, including alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, total bilirubin, conjugated bilirubin, gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, and/or other indicator of disease response. Similarly, successful therapy with a combination therapy described herein (e.g., a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing) can reduce the incidence of liver cancer in HCV subjects and/or the severity of liver cirrhosis in HCV subjects [0032] In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be effective to reduce viral titers to undetectable levels, to about 100 to about 500, to about 50 to about 100, to about 10 to about 50, or to about 15 to about 25 international units/mL serum. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be effective to reduce the viral load compared to the viral load before administration of a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing. For example, wherein the viral load is measured before administration of a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, and again after completion of the treatment regime with a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing. In some embodiments, an amount of a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be an amount that is effective to reduce viral load to lower than about 25 international units /mL of serum. In some embodiments, an amount of a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, is an amount that is effective to achieve a reduction in viral titer in the serum of the subject in the range of about 1.5-log to about a 2.5-log reduction, about a 3-log to about a 4-log reduction, or a greater than about 5-log reduction compared to the viral load before administration of a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing. For example, the viral load can be measured before administration of a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, and again after completion of the treatment regime with a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing. In some embodiments, including those of this paragraph, a reduction of viral load can be observed when comparing the viral load measured prior to the start of treatment with a combination described herein (for example, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing) and then 24 weeks after completion of treatment. In other embodiments, including those of this paragraph, a reduction of viral load can be observed when comparing the viral load measured prior to the start of treatment with a combination described herein (for example, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing) and then 4 weeks after completion of treatment. In still other embodiments, including those of this paragraph, a reduction of viral load can be observed when comparing the viral load measured prior to the start of treatment with a combination described herein (for example, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing) and then 4 weeks after completion of treatment. [0033] In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can result in at least a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 75, 100-fold or more reduction in the replication of HCV relative to pre-treatment levels in a subject, as determined after completion of the treatment regime. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can result in a reduction of the replication of HCV relative to pre-treatment levels in the range of about 2 to about 5 fold, about 10 to about 20 fold, about 15 to about 40 fold, or about 50 to about 100 fold. In some embodiments, including those of this paragraph, a reduction of HCV replication can be observed when comparing the level of HCV measured prior to the start of treatment with a combination described herein (for example, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing) and then 24 weeks after completion of treatment. In other embodiments, including those of this paragraph, a reduction of HCV replication can be observed when comparing the level of HCV measured prior to the start of treatment with a combination described herein (for example, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing) and then 4 weeks after completion of treatment. In still other embodiments, including those of this paragraph, a reduction of HCV replication can be observed when comparing the level of HCV measured prior to the start of treatment with a combination described herein (for example, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing) and then 12 weeks after completion of treatment. [0034] In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can result in a reduction of HCV replication in the range of 1 to 1.5 log, 1.5 log to 2 log, 2 log to 2.5 log, 2.5 to 3 log, 3 log to 3.5 log or 3.5 to 4 log more reduction of HCV replication compared to the reduction of HCV replication achieved by pegylated interferon in combination with ribavirin, administered according to the standard of care, or may achieve the same reduction as that standard of care therapy in a shorter period of time, for example, in one month, two months, or three months, as compared to the reduction achieved after six months of standard of care therapy with ribavirin and pegylated interferon. [0035] In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be effective to achieve a sustained viral response, for example, non-detectable or substantially non-detectable HCV RNA (e.g., less than about 500, less than about 400, less than about 200, less than about 100, or less than 25 international units per milliliter of serum) is found in the subject’s serum, for a period of at least about one month, at least about two months, at least about three months, at least about four months, at least about five months, or at least about six months following cessation of therapy. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be effective to achieve a sustained viral response, for example, non-detectable or substantially non-detectable HCV RNA (e.g., less than about 500, less than about 400, less than about 200, less than about 100, or 25 international units per milliliter of serum) is found in the subject’s serum, for a period of at least 4 weeks following cessation of therapy. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be effective to achieve a sustained viral response for a period of at least 12 weeks following cessation of therapy. [0036] In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can reduce a level of a marker of liver fibrosis by at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about 55%, at least about 60%, at least about 65%, at least about 70%, at least about 75%, or at least about 80%, or more, compared to the level of the marker in an untreated subject, or to a placebo-treated subject. Methods of measuring serum markers are known to those skilled in the art and include immunological-based methods, e.g., enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), radioimmunoassays, and the like, using antibody specific for a given serum marker. A non-limiting list of examples of markers includes measuring the levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), asparatate aminotransferacse (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) and total bilirubin (TBIL) using known methods. In general, an ALT level of less than about 45 IU/L (international units/liter), an AST in the range of 10-34 IU/L, ALP in the range of 44-147 IU/L, GGT in the range of 0-51 IU/L, TBIL in the range of 0.3-1.9 mg/dL is considered normal. In some embodiments, an effective amount of a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, is an amount effective to reduce ALT, AST, ALP, GGT and/or TBIL levels to within what is considered a normal level. [0037] Subjects who are clinically diagnosed with HCV infection include “na'ive” subjects (e.g., subjects not previously treated for HCV, particularly those who have not previously received IFN-alpha-based and/or ribavirin-based therapy) and individuals who have failed prior treatment for HCV (“treatment failure” subjects). Treatment failure subjects include “non-responders” (i.e., subjects in whom the HCV titer was not significantly or sufficiently reduced by a previous treatment for HCV (< 0.5 log IU/mL), for example, a previous IFN-alpha monotherapy, a previous IFN-alpha and ribavirin combination therapy, or a previous pegylated IFN-alpha and ribavirin combination therapy); and “relapsers” (i.e., subjects who were previously treated for HCV, for example, who received a previous IFN-alpha monotherapy, a previous IFN-alpha and ribavirin combination therapy, or a previous pegylated IFN-alpha and ribavirin combination therapy, whose HCV titer decreased, and subsequently increased). [0038] In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be administered to a naive subject suffering from HCV. In other embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be administered to a treatment failure subject suffering from HCV. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be administered to a non-responder subject suffering from HCV. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be administered to a relapsed subject suffering from HCV. In some embodiments of this paragraph, the subject can have cirrhosis of the liver. [0039] After a period of time, infectious agents can develop resistance to one or more therapeutic compounds. The term “resistance” as used herein refers to a viral strain displaying a delayed, lessened and/or null response to a therapeutic compound(s). For example, after treatment with an antiviral agent, the viral load of a subject infected with a resistant vims may be reduced to a lesser degree compared to the amount in viral load reduction exhibited by a subject infected with a non-resistant strain. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be administered to a subject infected with a HCV strain that is resistant to one or more different anti-HCV agents. In some embodiments, development of resistant HCV strains is delayed when subjects are treated with a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, compared to the development of HCV strains resistant to other HCV drugs. In some embodiments, including those of this paragraph, the resistance can be resistance to ribavirin, peginterferon alfa-2a (PEGASYS®), peginterferon alfa-2b (PEGATRON®), boceprevir and/or telaprevir. [0040] In some embodiments, an effective amount of a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be administered to a subject for whom other anti-HCV medications are contraindicated. For example, administration of pegylated interferon alpha in combination with ribavirin is contraindicated in subjects with hemoglobinopathies (e.g., thalassemia major, sickle-cell anemia) and other subjects at risk from the hematologic side effects of the current SOC therapy. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be provided to a subject that is hypersensitive to interferon. [0041] Some subjects being treated for HCV experience a viral load rebound. The term “viral load rebound” as used herein refers to a sustained >0.5 log IU/mL increase of viral load above nadir before the end of treatment, where nadir is a >0.5 log IU/mL decrease from baseline. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be administered to a subject experiencing viral load rebound, or can prevent such viral load rebound when used to treat the subject. [0042] The standard of care for treating HCV has been associated with several side effects (adverse events). In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can decrease the number and/or severity of one or more side effects that can be observed in HCV subjects being treated with ribavirin and pegylated interferon according to the standard of care. Examples of side effects include, but are not limited to fever, malaise, tachycardia, chills, headache, arthralgias, myalgias, fatigue, apathy, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, cognitive changes, asthenia, drowsiness, lack of initiative, irritability, confusion, depression, severe depression, suicidal ideation, anemia, low white blood cell counts, and thinning of hair. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can be provided to a subject that discontinued a HCV therapy because of one or more adverse effects or side effects associated with one or more other HCV agents (for example, ribavirin, peginterferon alfa-2a (PEGASYS®), peginterferon alfa-2b (PEGATRON®), boceprevir and/or telaprevir). [0043] Table A provides some embodiments of a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, compared to the standard of care. Examples include the following: in some embodiments, a combination as described herein of a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can result in a percentage of non-responders that is 10% less than the percentage of non-responders resulting from the standard of care; in some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can result in a number of side effects that is in the range of about 10% to about 30% less than compared to the number of side effects experienced by a subject receiving the standard of care; and in some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can result in a severity of a side effect (such as one of those described herein) that is 25% less than compared to the severity of the same side effect experienced by a subject receiving the standard of care. Methods of quantifying the severity of a side effect are known to those skilled in the art. Table A Percentage of non-responders Percentage of relapsers Percentage of resistance Percentage of viral load rebound Number of side effects Severity of side effects 10% less 10% less 10% less 10% less 10% less 10% less 25% less 25% less 25% less 25% less 25% less 25% less 40% less 40% less 40% less 40% less 40% less 40% less 50% less 50% less 50% less 50% less 50% less 50% less 60% less 60% less 60% less 60% less 60% less 60% less 70% less 70% less 70% less 70% less 70% less 70% less 80% less 80% less 80% less 80% less 80% less 80% less 90% less 90% less 90% less 90% less 90% less 90% less about 10% about 10% about 10% about 10% to about 10% to about 10% to to about to about to about about 30% about 30% about 30% 30% less 30% less 30% less less less less about 20% about 20% about 20% about 20% to about 20% to about 20% to to about to about to about about 50% about 50% about 50% 50% less 50% less 50% less less less less about 30% about 30% about 30% about 30% to about 30% to about 30% to to about to about to about about 70% about 70% about 70% 70% less 70% less 70% less less less less about 20% about 20% about 20% about 20% to about 20% to about 20% to to about to about to about about 80% about 80% about 80% 80% less 80% less 80% less less less less [0044] As used herein, a “subject” refers to an animal that is the object of treatment, observation or experiment. “Animal” includes cold- and warm-blooded vertebrates and invertebrates such as fish, shellfish, reptiles and, in particular, mammals. “Mammal” includes, without limitation, mice, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, dogs, cats, sheep, goats, cows, horses, primates, such as monkeys, chimpanzees, and apes, and, in particular, humans. In some embodiments, the subject is human. [0045] As used herein, the terms “treating,” “treatment,” “therapeutic,” or “therapy” do not necessarily mean total cure or abolition of the disease or condition. Any alleviation of any undesired signs or symptoms of a disease or condition, to any extent can be considered treatment and/or therapy. Furthermore, treatment may include acts that may worsen the subject's overall feeling of well-being or appearance. [0046] The term “effective amount” is used to indicate an amount of an active compound, or pharmaceutical agent, or combination of compounds or agents, that elicits the biological or medicinal response indicated. For example, an effective amount of compound can be the amount needed to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate a symptom of disease or prolong the survival of the subject being treated. For a combination, it is not necessary that each component be individually present in an effective amount; rather, all that is required is that there be an effective amount of a combination described herein. Preferably, each of the recited active components contributes to that collective effectiveness. This response may occur in a tissue, system, animal or human and includes alleviation of the signs or symptoms of the disease being treated. Determination of an effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, in view of the disclosure provided herein. The effective amount of the compounds disclosed herein required as a dose will depend on the route of administration, the type of animal, including human, being treated, and the physical characteristics of the specific animal under consideration. The dose can be tailored to achieve a desired effect, but will depend on such factors as weight, diet, concurrent medication and other factors which those skilled in the medical arts will recognize. [0047] In cases of administration of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, dosages may be calculated as the free base. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, in certain situations it may be necessary to administer the compounds disclosed herein in amounts that exceed, or even far exceed, the above-stated, preferred dosage range in order to effectively and aggressively treat particularly aggressive diseases or infections. [0048] Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma levels of the active moiety which are sufficient to maintain the modulating effects, or minimal effective concentration (MEC). The MEC will vary for each compound but can be estimated from in vitro data. Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will depend on individual characteristics and route of administration. However, HPLC assays or bioassays can be used to determine plasma concentrations. Dosage intervals can also be determined using MEC value. Compositions should be administered using a regimen which maintains plasma levels above the MEC for 10-90% of the time, preferably between 30-90% and most preferably between 50-90%. In cases of local administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the drug may not be related to plasma concentration. [0049] It should be noted that the attending physician would know how to and when to terminate, interrupt, or adjust administration due to toxicity or organ dysfunctions. Conversely, the attending physician would also know to adjust treatment to higher levels if the clinical response were not adequate (precluding toxicity). The magnitude of an administrated dose in the management of the disorder of interest will vary with the severity of the condition to be treated and the route of administration. The severity of the condition may, for example, be evaluated, in part, by standard prognostic evaluation methods. Further, the dose and perhaps dose frequency, will also vary according to the age, body weight, and response of the individual subject. A program comparable to that discussed above may be used in veterinary medicine. [0050] Compounds disclosed herein can be evaluated for efficacy and toxicity using known methods. For example, the toxicology of a particular compound, or of a subset of the compounds, sharing certain chemical moieties, may be established by determining in vitro toxicity towards a cell line, such as a mammalian, and preferably human, cell line. The results of such studies are often predictive of toxicity in animals, such as mammals, or more specifically, humans. Alternatively, the toxicity of particular compounds in an animal model, such as mice, rats, rabbits, or monkeys, may be determined using known methods. The efficacy of a particular compound may be established using several recognized methods, such as in vitro methods, animal models, or human clinical trials. When selecting a model to determine efficacy, the skilled artisan can be guided by the state of the art to choose an appropriate model, dose, route of administration and/or regime. [0051] Compound (A), compound (Β) and compound (C) can be contained in a single unit dosage form, in two unit dosage forms, or in three unit dosage forms. [0052] In some embodiments, a single unit dosage form can be include compound (A) and compound (Β). In other embodiments, one unit dosage form can include compound (A) and another unit dosage form can include compound (Β). If compound (C) is part of the combination therapy, compound (C) can be present with compound (A) and/or compound (Β), or compound (C) can be in a separate unit dosage form. [0053] The order of administration of a combination of a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can vary. In some embodiments, compound (A), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, can be administered prior to all compounds of the combination therapy. In other embodiments, compound (A), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, can be administered prior to at least one compound of the combination therapy. In still other embodiments, compound (A), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, can be administered concomitantly with one or more compound(s) of the combination therapy. In yet still other embodiments, compound (A), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, can be administered subsequent to the administration of at least one compound of the combination therapy. In some embodiments, compound (A), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, can be administered subsequent to the administration of all other compounds of the combination therapy. [0054] In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can result in an additive effect. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can result in a synergistic effect. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, can result in a strongly synergistic effect. In some embodiments, a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, is not antagonistic. [0055] As used herein, the term “antagonistic” means that the activity of the combination of compounds is less compared to the sum of the activities of the compounds in combination when the activity of each compound is determined individually (i.e., as a single compound). As used herein, the term “synergistic effect” means that the activity of the combination of compounds is greater than the sum of the individual activities of the compounds in the combination when the activity of each compound is determined individually. As used herein, the term “additive effect” means that the activity of the combination of compounds is about equal to the sum of the individual activities of the compounds in the combination when the activity of each compound is determined individually. [0056] A potential advantage of utilizing a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, may be a reduction in the required amount(s) of the compound(s) that is effective in treating HCV, as compared to the amount required to achieve same therapeutic result when the compound(s), is administered as monotherapy. For example, the amount of compound (A) and/or compound (Β), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, in a combination described herein can be less compared to the amount of compound (A) and/or compound (Β), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, needed to achieve the same viral load reduction when administered as a monotherapy. Another potential advantage of utilizing a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, is that the use of two or more compounds having different mechanisms of action can create a higher barrier to the development of resistant viral strains compared to the barrier when a compound is administered as monotherapy. [0057] Additional advantages of utilizing a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, may include little to no cross resistance between the compounds of the combination; different routes for elimination; little to no overlapping toxicities; little to no significant effects on cytochrome Ρ450; and/or little to no pharmacokinetic interactions between the compounds of the combination. Selection of Suitable Subjects for Treatment [0058] In some embodiments, potential subjects are evaluated for suitability prior to treatment. This can be part of a method and/or a use for treating the subject or for selecting a treatment for HCV infection. The objectives of the evaluation include ruling out subjects for whom the treatment may be undesirable, and selecting subjects who are most likely to respond to the treatment or those most likely to have reduced or no adverse events. [0059] Some methods and/or uses disclosed herein can be used for subjects having HCV infection. In some embodiments, the HCV infection can be a newly-diagnosed infection. In other embodiments, the HCV infection can be a chronic hepatitis C (CHC) infection. [0060] In some embodiments, the subject can have Type 1 HCV. In some embodiments, the subject can have Type la HCV. In other embodiments, the subject can have Type lb HCV. [0061] In some embodiments, the subject can have a HCV infection exhibiting Interleukin-28Β (IL-28b) CC genotype. In other embodiments, the subject can have a HCV infection exhibiting I1-28B non-CC genotype. [0062] Some methods and/or uses described herein can be effective to achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR) at a desired time point following the last dosing. SVR is defined as HCV RNA concentration below a lower limit of quantitation, preferably below 25 IU/mL. In some embodiments, a method and/or a use described herein can provide a SVR at 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 weeks. In other embodiments, a method and/or a use described herein can provide a SVR at 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 48, or 52 weeks (or more). In some embodiments, a method and/or a use described herein can provide a SVR at 4 weeks. In some embodiments, a method and/or a use described herein can provide a SVR at 12 weeks. [0063] The amino acid sequence of the nonstructural (NS)5A or NS5B proteins can affect the success of the treatment methods and/or uses described herein. By treating a plurality of subjects with different NS5A or NS5B protein sequences, those sequences can be characterized as responsive or non-responsive based on whether the subject achieves SVR at a desired time point, for example, one of the timepoints in the preceding paragraph. [0064] In some embodiments, a method and/or a use described herein for treating a subject with a HCV can further include assessing the NS5A protein sequence of the infecting HCV of a subject, and treating the subject with any of the methods and/or uses described herein if the NS5A is responsive NS5A. In other embodiments, a method and/or a use described herein for treating a subject with a HCV can further include assessing the NS5B protein sequence of the infecting HCV of a subject, and treating the subject with any of the HCV treatments described herein if the NS5B is responsive NS5B. [0065] In some embodiments, a method and/or a use described herein for treating a subject with a HCV treatment can further include assessing whether the subject has HCV Type la, and if so, treating the subject with any of the HCV treatments described herein. [0066] In some embodiments, a method and/or a use described herein for treating a subject with a HCV can further include assessing whether the subject has HCV Type lb, and if so, treating the subject with any of the HCV treatments described herein. [0067] In some embodiments, a method and/or a use described herein for treating a subject with a HCV can further include assessing whether the subject has HCV with 11-28 genotype CC, and if so, treating the subject with any of the HCV treatments described herein. [0068] In some embodiments, a method and/or a use described herein for treating a subject with a HCV can further include assessing whether the subject has HCV with 1128 non-CC genotype, and if so, treating the subject with any of the HCV treatments described herein. [0069] In some embodiments, a method and/or a use described herein for treating a subject with a HCV can further include assessing whether the subject has HCV Type 2, and if so, treating the subject with any of the HCV treatments described herein. [0070] In some embodiments, a method and/or a use described herein for treating a subject with a HCV can further include assessing whether the subject has HCV Type 3, and if so, treating the subject with any of the HCV treatments described herein. [0071] In some embodiments, a method and/or a use described herein for treating a subject with a HCV can further include assessing whether the subject has CHC, and if so, treating the subject with any of the HCV treatments described herein. [0072] In some embodiments, a method and/or a use described herein described herein may further include evaluating a subject and selecting a subject for treatment with that therapy where one or more or all of the following are true: a. In some embodiments, the subject has genotype 1 CHC. In other embodiments, the subject has genotype 2, 3, or 4 HCV.

[0074] In some embodiments, a method and/or use described herein can further include a method of selecting a treatment for a subject having HCV, comprising evaluating whether the subject meets one or more of the specified criteria for treatment specified above, and/or whether the subject does not meet one or more of the specified exclusion criteria above, and if so, treating the subject with an effective amount of a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing. [0075] Some embodiments described herein relate to a method of treating a subject having HCV, that can include administering an effective amount of a combination of compound (A), compound (Β) and optionally compound (C), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the foregoing, wherein the subject meets one or more of the specified criteria for treatment specified above, and/or whether the subject does not meet one or more of the specified exclusion criteria above. [0076] Some embodiments described herein relate to a method for treating HCV infection using a method and/or use described herein that can further include monitoring the subject for signs of virologic failure, and if so, discontinuing the treatment. [0077] Virologic failure is defined as subjects with an on-treatment increase of >1 log 10 in HCV RNA levels compared to the lowest recorded on-treatment value (nadir), or subjects with confirmed on-treatment >LLOQ (lower limit of quantitation) HCV RNA levels after previously having <LLOQ HCV RNA levels on treatment, or subjects who have relapse (i.e., subjects with <LLOQ HCV RNA levels at last planned dose of treatment who develop >LLOQ HCV RNA levels during the Virologic Follow-up Period).

Further, at 4 weeks after completion of treatment, 73% (8 of 11) of the subjects achieved undetectable HCV RNA. The 73% (8 of 11) of the subjects still achieved undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks after completion of treatment. Only 2 of the 11 subjects experienced viral breakthrough while receiving the combination regiment, and only 1 of 11 subjects relapsed during the follow-up visits. [0093] Results for Group 2: After 4 weeks of treatment, 58 percent (7 of 12) of the subjects achieved undetectable HCV RNA (less than 25 IU/mL). In addition, at 4 weeks after completion of treatment, 83% (10 of 12) of the subjects achieved undetectable HCV RNA. The 83% (10 of 12) of the subjects still achieved undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks after completion of treatment. Only 1 of the 12 subjects discontinued treatment due to vomiting and nausea. Of the 11 subjects who then completed the 12 weeks treatment, 10 of 11 (91%) achieved a sustained viral response at both 4 and 12 weeks after completion of treatment. [0094] As demonstrated by the results for Groups 1 and 2, more than 73% of subjects, and as high as 91%, achieved a sustained viral response 4 weeks after completion of treatment. At 12 weeks after completion of treatment, still more than 73% of subjects, and as high as 91%, achieved a sustained viral response. By comparison only 39-50% of genotype 1 subjects achieved a sustained viral response using the current standard of care, (see Casey et al., Curr Opin Gastroenterol. (2013) 29(3):243-249; and Pearlman et al., Gastroenterol. Hepatol. (2010) 6(3 Suppl 6): 1-12.
