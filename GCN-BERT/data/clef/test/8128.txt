Example 2A
2-tert-Butyl 4-ethyl 3-methyl-5-{[(2-phenylethyl)carbamoyl]amino}thiophene-2,4-dicarboxylate
10.0 g (35.0 mmol) of 2-tert-butyl 4-ethyl 5-amino-3-methylthiophene-2,4-dicarboxylate (Example 1A) were dissolved in 500 ml of dichloromethane and 11.4 g (70.1 mmol) of N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) and 19.6 ml (140 mmol) of triethylamine were added. The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 2 days, after which 8.8 ml (70.1 mmol) of 2-phenethylamine were added. After stirring at RT for a further 2 h, the mixture was evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator. The remaining residue was purified by MPLC (silica gel, cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 20:1â†’10:1). After evaporation of the product fractions and drying of the residue under high vacuum, 14.4 g (95% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
