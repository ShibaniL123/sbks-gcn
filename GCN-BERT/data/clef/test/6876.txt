Preparation of 2,2-difluoropropyl trifluoromethanesulfonate
Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (3.29 ml, 19.5 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of 2,2-difluoropropan-1-ol (1.7 g, 18 mmol) in DCM (40 mL) at −10° C. (salt/ice bath). 2,6-Dimethylpyridine (2.5 mL, 21 mmol) was then added, and the reaction was stirred for 1 hour under these conditions. The reaction was then washed with water (×2), and the organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure (vacuum ˜200 mbars) to afford 2,2-difluoropropyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (2.1 g, 52%) as a red oil.
