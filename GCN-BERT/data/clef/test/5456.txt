2@= J This invention relates generally to the wrapping of material and more particularly to the positioning of an underwrap sheet beneath such material. The apparatus and method is especially adaptable for use in wrapping bundles of newspapers or the like and as will be apparent can be used wherever an underwrap sheet is to be used. When used for wrapping bundles of newspapers, for example, an overwrap sheet will be applied subsequent to tying the bundles. In the use mentioned above, there the delivery of numerous bundles of newspapers to outlying areas is necessary, it is important that the bundles be wrapped as expeditiously and rapidly as possible after the papers leave the presses. A primary object of the invention is to provide a novel method and apparatus for substantially automatically positioning an underwrap sheet beneath material to be wrapped. A h r object of the invention is to provide a novel method whereby the material to be wrapped functions with the :; erwrap sheet as it is being convened from one station to a next and to position an underwrap sheet for disposition beneath additional material. mother object of the invention is to provide ap paratus whereby material to be wrapped is convoked in timed sequence to a aperiodicity severed underwrap sheet obtained from a power driven endless web of wrangling material. A more secular object of invention is to provide apparatus including spaced conveying means define the path of travel of material to have an underwrap sheet disposed therebeneath and including means to periodically sever an underwrap sheet from a power driven continuous web and position the sheet in the path through which the material is being conv ed whereby the sheet is positioned beneath the material during its travel from the spaced conveying m ns. 0 her objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent during the course of the following deacription. In the drawings there is shown one preferred embodiment of the invention. In this showing: ig. i is a side elevation óf the novel apparatus, illustrating the novel method, with portions shown in section for the purpose of clarity; Fig. 2 is a top plan view of the apparatus of Fig. i; Fig. 3 is atransverse, enlarged, fragmentary section taken substantially on line 3-3 of Fig. 2» with portions broken aw y for purposes of clarity; Fig. is a section taken substantially on line $-4 of Fig. 3 showing details of the cutter means of the apparatus, and Fig. 5 is a diagramatic view showing a wiring diagram in relation to the novel apparatus to obtain the timed sequence of the co-operating portions thereof. :j 3. Referring to the drawing in detail, the novel apparatus is indicated generally at i0 and includes a substantially rectangular skeletonized support frame 12 constructed from suitable angle members or the like. In order to render the apparatus readily mobile, suitable caster wheel assemblies l are secured te the lower corners of the frame 12. The frame 12 has supported on transverse ,ngl e members 15 extending between side frame members 16 and 17, suitable side aprons 18 and 20 between which is provided an alongated longitudinale extending passage or open well 21 which bas disposed therein in spaced longitudinale extending relation a first endless conveyor indicated generally at 22 and a second endless conveyor indicated generally at 2J+. The first and seeend conveyors rosy be conventionally described as first and secend stations, respectively, for a bundle of newspapers B or the like which will be moved along a predetermined path of travel therebetween. The conveyor 22 includes a rear cylinderical roller 26 carried on a tremsverse shaft jounced at opposite ends in bearings 30 depending in spaced aligned relationship fran opposite sides of the side frame members 16 17 of the ï rsme 12. The convoEor 22 also includes a r t cylinderical roller 6 which i carried on a shaft 38 Journ-11ed at opposite ends in aligned bearings 0 depending from an intermediate portion of the sidle frame membre 16 and 17. The rollers bave enticed thereover a pluralism of transversely spaoed endless belts which may comprise conventional helically wound wires, the upper run of the belts being substant AoE1y coplanar with the apron 18 and 20 as seen in Figs. I and 3. The shaft 38 ha ii h ii a V-pulley 44 secured thereto in alignent with a drive pulley 6 on the drive sha of an electric motor 48, and a drive belt 50 is entrained over the pulleys 44 and 6. The motor 48 is mounted on a suitable horizontally pivotal support plate 52 mounted at 53 on the frame 12. The second conveyor 24 includes a rear cylinderical roller 54 carried on a transverse shaft 56 journalled in spaced aligned b 58 depending from the frame members 15 and 16, and a front cylinderical roller 60 ïs mounted on a transverse shaft 62 Joulma!led at opposite ends in aligned bearings 65 depending from the side frame tomberai I and 16 and braced as indicated ai 66. The rear roller 5/+ is in spaced relation from the front roller 36 of the conveyor 22 as seen in Pigs. i and 2 and indicated at 55 for a purpose to subsequently become apparent. The rollers 54 and 56 have entrained thereover transversely spaced endless belts 68 which may be helically wound wires similar %0 belts 2. The upper run of the belts OE are also substantially coplanar with the aprons IS and 20 and the upper runs of belts 42. Due to the length of the belts 68 an intermediate cylinderical, transverse support roller 70 is mounted on a shaft 72 having its e ds journalled in aligned bearings 7/+ depending froe the frame members 15 and 16. The shaft 56 has secured te an intermediate portion thereof a V-pulley 76 in larment with a,, drive p-l ey 78 on the drive shaft of an electric motor mounted on a support plate 82 pivotally mounted at 84 on. the frame 12. A drive belt 86 is entrained over the pulleys 76 and 78. The weight of the motors 48 and 80 on their respective support plates will cause the belts 50 and 86 to be tight in driving relationship with their respective pulleys. I • L o. 631508 iA i'?1- . Projecting rearwardly from the vertical frame mmn-' bots 88 (only one shown in Fig. i) at opposite aides of the frame 12 are converging support members 90 which support L aligned bearings 92 in which are journalled opposite ends of a support spindle 94 of a replacable convoluted roll 96 of wrapping paper or the like. The roll 96 provides a continu s web 98 which will be power driven and sever in predetermined lengths to form an underwrap sheet i00 to be disposed beneath the bundle a will be presently descrìbed in detail. J ed in suitable aligned bearings 102, carried on an upper portion of %ho support members 0 adjacent the frame members 88. is a support shale i05 of a cylinderical webfeed roller 106 of rubber, steel or the 4 e, over which the web 98 is entrained; see Pig. i. The web 98 o£ wrangling materlal generally does no% have sufficìent tensile strength and thus means is provided fo power rotate the convoluted roll 96 in synchronized relation with th web-feed roller 106. ivot- .11y mounted in spaced relation on the shaft i04 is a pair o£ suppor arms 108 which carry in their terminal ends .14 gned bearings 110 in which is journalled ands of a support shaft 112 of a rubber surfaced, cylinderical, roll-drive roller 114 which tangentially engages the upper surface of the convoluted roll 96. The shaft 10,6. has secured thereon a sprocket sheet 116 in aliment with a sprocket wheel II8 fined fo the end of shaft 112 of the roller 116,, and an endless drive chain 120 is entra&ued over e sprocket wheels. Pivo%al,l,y abounded on a transverse support shaft 122 timed by the frame members 88 above the roller 106 is a pair of spaced support arms 124 and 126 which carry a transverse support ht 128 upon chiot : ii i: i :"i ïJ i!i iii:! ii:i iii :: "..i - ....... , "i il l_i. i!i.» !0 is j ournalled a rubber idler roller 130 which tangentially engages the upper surface of the web 98 as it passes over the roller 106. The arms 124 and126 have extending transversely between their terminal ends a rod 132 providing additional weight to cause the roll 130 to be biased by gravity into engagement with the web. The shako 104 includes a pulley 134 on one end, see Fig. 2, in aliment with a pulley 136 on the drive shaft of a motor 138 mounted on a horizontally pivotal support plate 140 carried on the frame 12 as indicated ai I 2. A drive belt I % is entrained over the pulleys 134 and 136 and is ta sioned by the weight of the motor 13 on the support plate I 0. If will be observed that the positively driven rollers 106 and 114 insure movement of the web 98 off the roll 96 and the roller 130 insures movement of the web toward a guillotine cutter assembly indicated gener-lly at 156, see Figs. i, 3 and 4. The cutter assembly 146 includes a fixed blade assembly I 8 extending transversely and horizontal between longitudinally g, intermediate frame members 150 w ch are secured at opposite ends to intermediate abortions of the vertical frame members 88 and vertical frame members 152 (only one shown The blade assembly I includes two elongated mating portions 154 and 156 retained together by means of transverse bolts 158. The bolts 158 also extend through an elongated blade 160 which includes an disposed eutting edge 162. inwardly biased by compression spring 164 is a pair of elongated Jaws 166 and 168 which normally extend on opposite b m .•• . • k.. : "•/ . .ï P iI, 3o sides of the blade 160 te enclose the cutting edge 162. The mating portions 155 and 156 include inwardly turned flanges 170 and 172, respectively, which engage outwardly turned flange portions 174 and 176 on the jawm 166 and 168, respectivel te limit upward movement of the Jaws. Thus the cutting edge is normally within the downwardly displacable jaws transversely beneath the web 98 as clearly seen in Fig. 4. Opposite ends of the portions 154 and 156 are secured to the frame members 152 by elongated bolts 178 end spaced nuts 180. The bolts 178 extend vertically above the frame members 152 and reciprocally receive thereon apertured end portions of an elongated inverted Unshapely easing 182 of a bumper 185. The easing is retned on the bolts 178 by means of nuts 186 and a resilient washer or bumper element 18V is interposed between the nuts and the casing ends. The casing has secured therein an elongated bumper element 188 oZ rubber or an suitable material which includes a downward opining groove 190 which is in aliment with the cutter blade 160 and receives the cutter edge 162 therein when the bumper i is displaced downward in a cutting stroke te displace the jawa 166 and 168 to sever the web. The cling has secured transversely of opposite upper ends mounting plates 192 which ìnclude a vertically disposed apertured eye portion in which is disposed the lower hook-end portion of a tension sprang 194. The upper hock-ends of the springs are secured in depending apertured support bracket 196. The springs normally hlas the bumper I vertically above the cutter blade 160. A pair oZ spaoed rods 198 depend from %ho plates 192 being retained thereto by mAinof nuts 200. Secured to the rods 198 by meant of nuis 202 are plates 20 including a bifurcated apertured eye Portion 206. .t. • - . . . . ..... - • r.: . L t Secured to the eye portions 206 by a pin 208 are armature cores 210 of a solenoid oeil 212. The coil 212 includes a housing having vertically extending slots I ;ï receiving bolt 216 therethrough which are received in a pair of spaced vertical support elements 218 extending between the lower side frame members 220 of the frame 12 (only one shown) and the frame members 150. An inwardly projecting bracket 222 is supported on the elements 218 and supports a vertically adjustable abutment screw Æ retained in an adjusted position by nuts 226. Energization of the solenoid coils 212 ill result in downward movoeent of the bumper 184 to overcome the tension springs 194 and cause the web 98 to be severed in an underwrap sheet i00. The frame members 150 include opposed brackets 223 which pivotally support at 230 flanged side 232 of a convex guide plate 234 which extends transversely from the cutter assembly 146 Ul and terminates in an upper guide edge 236 adjacent the roller 54 of the conveyor 24. The guide plate 234 will be effective to engage the leading edge 2.38 of the web 98, prier 1o the sheet i00 being severed, and direct the same vertically into the space 55 between the conveyers 22 and 24 for engagement by the bundle B as it moves from conveyor 22 te 24. The fudged sides 232 of the guide plate OE include arcuate slots 240 concentric te the pivot 230 and receive wing bolts 242 therethrough, the wing bolts being received in suitably apertured portions of the brackets 228. The pivotal adjustment of the guide plate facilitates adjustment of the leading edge of the plate relative to the rear end of the conveyor 24 to insure engagement of the underwrap sheet on the 20. conveyor belts 68 which are colmtantly rotated. During operation of the apparatus, the conveyor 2]+ is constantly operated, and the conveyor 22, guillotine cutter assembly 156 and power driven convoluted roll 96 are operated in timed sequence to afford cutting of the underwrap sheet prior to engagement thereof by the bundle B as it moves from the conveyor 22 to A control switch 2z/. is conveniently located on the frame member 88, see Figs. i and 5, and ae will subsequently be descrïbed in detail relative %0 Fig. 5, depression of the switch 2zI: will cause the motor to be energized to move the bundle B on conveyor 22 toward conveyor + and through the position shown by p ketone lines in Fig. i. The bundle B during the movement will steep the termiñal end of a severed sheet I00 onto the belts 68 of the conveyor to be drawn along and beneath the bundle. A short time after the bundle B starts to movement blade assembly solenoid Coils will be energized to operate the blade assembly I/+6 a previously mentioned fo sever the sheet from the conf umous web 9 After a predetermined time delay of about 1/25th of a second the blade activating coils 212 will be de-energized, releasing the pad 188 from the blade 160. At approximately the same time, the motor 138 will be activatecl whereby the web 98 w 11 be fed toward the guide plate 234 until the leading edge of the web reaches the position shown in Pigo I» after which the motor 138 will be de-energized along with %he rest of the eystem, exoep% the motor 80 which is in constant operation. A simplified schematic wiring diagram is shown in i ,,¸!{!r Fig. 5, with í ses, switch boxes, and other convention structure being omitted from the drawing. Ar conventional electrical tlmCug device may be used in the circuit, for example, those of the type called "ASastats". These devices are shown in squares marked "time delay" on the drawing. The time delay Asastats", not shown in detail, comprise a springbiased armature including a piston in a cylinder, the movement of which being controlled by a bleed aperture. Contacts are arranged on the armature to open or close a circuit. Referring to Fig. 5, a master swítch 146 is closed to energize the circuit. This causes the motor 80 to be emergized through the circuit 248 to cause the conveyor 24 to be rotated in the direction indicated. Depression of the control switch Æ will start the sequence of operations previously mentioned by closing a control circuit 250, a conveyor circuit 252 for the motor 48 of the conveyor 22, and a circuit 254 for energizing the motor 138 which the power driven roll of wrapping paper 96. Radiately as the switch Æ is closed, the circuit 250 is closed and s01 en0 idS256 is energized. At the same time circuit 250 is closed, circuit 252 for the first conveyor is closed to move the bundle B toward the conveyor 2 Aí er a predetermined period, a time delay control 258 energized by the closing of contacts 260 of the switch Æ, will cause the closed contacts 262 to open to cause: de-auergization of the circuit 252. Immediately before or about the same time as the leading edge of the bundle B reaches the leading edge 238 of the web, a time del v switch 264, which has normally open contacts 266 action - il to energize a circuit 268 to the blade energizing coils 212 to sever the sheet 100. After a short dwell, approximately 1/25th of a second, the time delay switch 26/+ will funtion to re-open the contacts 266 and open the circuit 268. At approximately the same time, or mmedlately after the circuit 268 is re-opened, a time delay switch 270 having normally open contacts 272 will operate te close the contacts 272 to energize the circuit 25 to cause the motor 138 te operate to feed the web 98 over the blade assembly 146 and along the guide plate 23 to the open space 55 between the conveyors. The switch 244 which was previously actuated will have ctioned to close a second set of contacts 274 to permit energization of the circuit 254. After a predetermined interval sufficient te permit the web 98 te be fed into its proper position, a time delay switch 276 including normally close contacts 278, will function to open the contacts Æ8 amà deenergize the circuit 250 resulting in the de-energizing of solenoide 256 which will cause the circuit 254 te be de-auezgized te stop the motor 138. At this time all the circuits, except circuit 258 to motor 80, will be de-energized, and after a new bundle B has. been disposed on conveyor 22 the switch Æ will once more be closed for the initiation of the next sequential operation of the co-operating components of the apparats. The bundle indicated at B' will have the underwrap shoat I00 properly disposed therebeneath preparatory to having an overwrap sheet disposed on the bundle and permit tying of the bundle.
