BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Linezolid is a synthetic antibacterial agent. Chemically, it is (S)—N-[[3-[3-Fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide. The empirical formula is C16H20FN3O4. Its molecular weight is 337.35. Linezolid is used in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infections; nosocomial pneumonia; complicated skin and skin structure infections including diabetic foot infections, without concomitant osteomyelitis; uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections and community acquired pneumonia. Linezolid is sold in the U.S. under the brand name(s) of ZYVOX® I.V. Injection, ZYVOX Tablets, and ZYVOX for Oral Suspension. Tablets were given two to three times a day. Linezolid and its salts are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,688,792. Crystalline form I and II are known polymorphs of Linezolid. Crystalline form I of linezolid was described by J. Med. Chem. 39(3), 673-679, 1996. U.S. Pat. No. 6,559,305 discloses a crystalline linezolid form II. WO2007/102082 assigned to Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd discloses compositions of Linezolid crystalline Form II containing lactose-based water soluble excipient. In the recent years, a new polymorph of linezolid, namely form III, was discovered and described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,714,128. The crystalline form III was characterized by an x-ray powder diffraction spectrum having peaks expressed as 20 at about 7.6, 9.6, 13.6, 14.9, 18.2, 18.9, 21.2, 22.3, 25.6, 26.9, 27.9 and 29.9 degrees. U.S. Publication no. 2007/0104785 discloses a manufacture of the solid oral dosage form of linezolid Form III. It describes a gelling potential of linezolid Form III which affects the reproducibility of dissolution. The manufacturing of the dosage form with reproducible dissolution profile was achieved by using effervescent couple (or) by incorporating water insoluble polymers (or) by adding clays in the dosage form (or) combinations thereof.

Dry granulating linezolid form III with polacrilin potassium as disintegrant retains its polymorphic form in the dosage form as compared to other superdisintegrants such as croscarmellose sodium. Dry granulating linezolid form III with lactose monohydrate, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and/or starch, polacrilin potassium and magnesium stearate enhances the stability by retaining its polymorphic form. Wet granulating linezolid form III with 10% w/w of water as granulation solvent are stable to maintain its crystallinity in Form III. Dry granulation is better than wet granulation to provide a stable formulation with out polymorphic form conversion. 1.
