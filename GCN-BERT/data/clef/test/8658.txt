CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application 61/976,783, filed on Apr. 8, 2014, and incorporated herein by reference. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to hair accessories, and more particularly to a ponytail holder with an interchangeable outer cover. DISCUSSION OF RELATED ART Ponytail holders are known in the art for keeping a person's ponytail intact and in place on her head. Such holders take the form of a two-part circular, cylindrical, or conical shape through which the ponytail is inserted and held in place thereby. Some prior art holders have interlacing teeth, such as U.S. Pat. No. 2,445,071 to Kovacs et al. on Feb. 7, 1947; U.S. Pat. No. 5,937,867 to Williams on Aug. 17, 1999; U.S. Pat. No. 7,963,289 to King on Jun. 21, 2011; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,311,699 to Horman on Nov. 6, 2001. Such prior art devices may hold a ponytail intact for a while, but throughout the day and with movement of the person's head the ponytail frequently dislodges from a single row of teeth or spikes. U.S. Pat. No. 6,089,240 to Chang on Jul. 18, 2000 teaches a hair grip device having two rows of elastic plates that serve to compress the ponytail therebetween. Such a device includes an outer flange that is used to open the device to insert the ponytail, yet the flange is a mechanical contraption that interrupts the outward appearance of the product. Further, with such a device there is no provision for changing the appearance, color, pattern, or other decorative features, which women and girls often desire in order to match a particular outfit, mood or hairstyle. Moreover, once the elastic plates of such a product become worn and ineffective, there is no provision for replacing them without replacing the entire device. So-called “hair cones” and “hair cuffs” sold over the Internet have similar disadvantages. Therefore, there is a need for a device will securely hold a ponytail even with continual movement of the person over the course of a day. Such a needed invention would provide means for quickly changing the outward appearance of the device, and would provide for changing elastic bands that help hold the ponytail in place as they become worn. Such a needed device would be relatively inexpensive to manufacture, and easy to use. The present invention accomplishes these objectives. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present device is a holder for a person's ponytail. A frustoconical shell has first and second parts each mutually connected at a hinged edge with a hinge and positionable between open and closed positions. Each part has an inner surface, an outer surface, and a clasping edge opposite the hinged edge. The clasp edges of each part are mutually, selectively fastenable with at least one mechanical clasp, or the like, to secure the shell in the closed position. Each part has a top edge and a bottom edge that together form a top opening and a bottom opening for receiving the ponytail therethrough. A frustoconical cover is fixable with the shell when the shell is in the closed position. The cover includes an outer surface, an inner surface that is adapted to abut the outer surface of each part of the shell, a top opening, and a bottom opening. The cover preferably includes a distinct color, pattern, or image, and the ponytail holder includes a plurality of the covers in a set that can be interchanged with the shell as desired by the person. Preferably each part of the shell further includes a plurality of tapered spikes projecting away therefrom. The spikes of both parts of the shell are substantially mutually parallel when the shell is in the closed position. Such spikes may be arranged in at least one horizontal row of spikes, but preferably two or three rows. Preferably the shell and the cover each include one part of a two-part mechanical fastening mechanism for selectively fixing the cover to the shell when the shell is in the closed position. Such a fastening mechanism may include at least one inward projection proximate the bottom opening of the cover and at least one recess in the outer surface of each part of the shell proximate the bottom opening of the shell. The at least one projection is adapted for a snap fit with the recess to selectively secure the cover to the shell by friction. In one embodiment, the at least one recess is a plurality of recesses, such as 4, 8, 12 or 16, and the at least one inward projection is a plurality of inward projections. Alternately, the at least one recess is a continuous groove formed about the outer surface of each part of the shell proximate the bottom opening thereof. In one embodiment, the fastening mechanism includes at least one magnet fixed with the inner surface of the cover and another magnet fixed with the outer surface of the shell. Alternately, the fastening mechanism includes a hook-and-loop type fastening material or a low-tact adhesive applied to either the inner surface of the cover and/or the outer surface of the shell. Preferably each part of the shell includes at least one loop proximate the hinged edge and at least one hook proximate the clasping edge. As such, an elastic band, such as a rubber band, may be engaged with the hooks and loops to create an elastic ponytail grip to compress the ponytail when the shell is secured around the ponytail in the closed position. The present invention is a device that securely holds a ponytail even with continual movement of the person over the course of a day. The present device provides for quickly changing the outward appearance of the device, provides a seamless outward appearance, and provides for changing internal elastic bands that help hold the ponytail in place as they become worn. The present device is relatively inexpensive to manufacture and easy to use.

FIGS. 1-4 illustrate a holder 10 for a ponytail 15 of a person 14. A frustoconical shell 20 has first and second parts 30,40 each mutually connected at a hinged edge 34,44 with a hinge 190, and positionable between open and closed positions 50,60. Each part 30,40 has an inner surface 31,41 an outer surface 39,49, and a clasping edge 36,46 opposite the hinged edge 34,44. The clasp edge 36,46 of each part 30,40 are mutually, selectively fastenable with at least one mechanical clasp 200, or the like, to secure the shell 20 in the closed position 60. Each part 30,40 has a top edge 38,48 and a bottom edge 32,42 that together form a top opening 70 and a bottom opening 80 (FIGS. 6 and 7). The shell 20 is preferably made from a suitable injection molded plastic that is semi-rigid such that the clasp 200 may be opened and closed and such that the shell 20 securely holds the ponytail 15 without becoming easily dislodged thereby until the shell 20 is opened. The shell 20 may include a distinct color, pattern, or image (not shown) on the outer surface 39,49 thereof. The hinge 190 is preferably a living hinge 190, such that each part 30,40 of the shell 20 may be integrally injection molded. Alternately the hinge 190 is a traditional two-part hinge (not shown), such that the two parts 30,40 are separately molded and then pivotally affixed together at the hinge 190. Each part 30,40 is substantially a mirror image of the other, except for the one or more clasps 200. A frustoconical cover 90 is fixable with the shell 20 when the shell 20 is in the closed position 60. The cover 90 includes an outer surface 99, an inner surface 91 that is adapted to abut the outer surface 39,49 of each part 30,40 of the shell 20, a top opening 98, and a bottom opening 92 (FIG. 10). The cover 90 may be split down one side thereof to form a wrap 93 that is secured around the shell 20 (FIG. 5). Alternately, the cover 90 may receive the wrap 93, the wrap 93 being an adhesive label or paper having a distinct pattern (not shown), color or image applied thereto. Typically the cover 90 includes a distinct color, pattern, or image (not shown), and preferably the ponytail holder 10 includes a plurality of the covers 90 that can be interchanged with the shell 20 as desired by the person 14. The one or more covers 90 are preferably made for a suitable plastic or paper material. Preferably each part 30,40 of the shell 20 further includes a plurality of tapered spikes 100 projecting away therefrom. The spikes 100 of both parts 30,40 of the shell 20 are substantially mutually parallel and interlaced when the shell 20 is in the closed position 60. Alternately, such spikes 100 are not mutually parallel when the shell 20 is closed (not shown), wherein the spikes 100 bind the ponytail 15. Such spikes 100 may be arranged in at least one horizontal row 110 of spikes 100, but preferably two or three rows 110 (FIG. 7), at least one row 110 being an upper horizontal row 120 and another row 110 being a lower horizontal row 130. Preferably the shell 20 and the cover 90 each include one part of a two-part mechanical fastening mechanism 140 for selectively fixing the cover 90 to the shell 20 when the shell 20 is in the closed position 60. Such a fastening mechanism 140 may include at least one inward projection 143 proximate the bottom opening 92 of the cover 90 and at least one recess 144 (FIGS. 8-11) in the outer surface 39,49 of each part 30,40 of the shell 20 proximate the bottom opening 80 of the shell 20. The at least one projection 143 is adapted for a snap fit with the recess 144 to secure the cover 90 to the shell 20. In one embodiment, the at least one recess 144 is a plurality of recesses 144, and the at least one inward projection 143 is a plurality of inward projections 143. Alternately, the at least one recess is a continuous groove 145 (FIGS. 10 and 11) formed about the outer surface 39,49 of each part 30,40 of the shell 20 proximate the bottom opening 80 thereof. In one embodiment, the fastening mechanism 140 includes at least one magnet 146 fixed with the inner surface 91 of the cover 90 and another magnet 146 fixed with the outer surface 39,49 of the shell 20. Alternately, the fastening mechanism includes a hook-and-loop type fastening material 147 (FIG. 5), or a low-tact adhesive 148 (FIG. 5) applied to either the inner surface 91 of the cover 90 and/or the outer surface 39,49 of the shell 20. Preferably each part 30,40 of the shell 20 includes at least one loop 150 proximate the hinged edge 34,44 and at least one hook 160 proximate the clasping edge 36,46. As such, an elastic band 170, such as a rubber band, may be engaged with the hooks 150 and loops 160 to create an elastic ponytail grip 180 to compress the ponytail 15 when the shell 20 is secured around the ponytail 15 in the closed position 60. In use, the person 14 positions her ponytail 15 into the shell 20 when the shell 20 is in the open position 50 (FIG. 1), and then squeezes the shell 20 so that the at least one clasp 200 secure the shell 20 in the closed position 60 with the ponytail entering the shell 20 at the bottom opening 80 and exiting the top opening 70. One of the covers 90 is selected and the ponytail 15 is threaded through the top and bottom openings 98,92 thereof until the cover 90 is positioned over the shell 20 (FIG. 2). The cover 90 is then secured to the shell 20 with the fastening mechanism 140 (FIG. 3). While a particular form of the invention has been illustrated and described, it will be apparent that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, the shell 20 and cover 90 are shown tapered, but may in fact be instead substantially cylindrical (not shown).
