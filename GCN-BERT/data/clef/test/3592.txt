RELATED APPLICATION This patent application is a divisional of co-pending application Ser. No. 13/902,017, filed May 24, 2013, which claims priority to Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/651,442, filed on May 24, 2012, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD This document relates generally to packaging for use with a plurality of containers and, more particularly, to packaging for use in the point-of-sale (POS) display of consumer products, such as smokeless tobacco products. WORKING ENVIRONMENT Recently, new forms of smokeless tobacco products have entered the market place or have been described, including products in the form of gels, films and tablets. Designing packaging for use with a smokeless tobacco product in the form of a tablet provides unique challenges. For example, with tobacco-based products, moisture content can become an issue, since tobacco is, by its nature, hygroscopic. Child-resistance is also another desirable property for packaging used with a smokeless tobacco product. In the packaging of tablets for distribution to consumers, blister packs are frequently utilized. Larger format tablets may be packaged in tubular containers, as often found in pharmaceutical and medical products. A stack of large format tablets tend to survive the rigors of shipping, since the tablets are not free to randomly collide with one another through product jostling during transit. Despite the advances in the art, there remains a need for improved display cartons and systems for use with large format tablets packaged in containers that contain a plurality of tablets, such as smokeless tobacco products and for methods of making and displaying such packaging.
