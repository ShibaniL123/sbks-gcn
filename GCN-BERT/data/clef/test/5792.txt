Intermediate 63: 7-Chloro-6-(difluoromethyl)-4-methyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-c]pyridine
Step A: 2-Chloro-3-(difluoromethyl)-5-methylpyridine. To a solution of 2-chloro-5-methylpyridine-3-carbaldehyde (5.00 g, 32.1 mmol) in dichloromethane (50 mL) was added diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST) (6.4 mL, 48.4 mmol) over 30 min at 0° C. The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred for 2 h. The reaction was quenched with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (40 mL). The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (3×100 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (1×25 mL). The organic layer was dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated. Purification (FCC, SiO2, n-hexane:ethyl acetate (10:1)) afforded the title compound (3.45 g, 19.4 mmol, 60%) as a yellow liquid.
