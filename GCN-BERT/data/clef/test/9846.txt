Cross Reference to Related Application The present application claims priority benefit to Chinese Patent Application No. 201410126515.6, filed on March 31, 2014, the content of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety for all purposes. Technical Field In certain aspects, the present disclosure relates to method and apparatus for analysis of biomolecules. In particular aspects, the present disclosure relates to an integrated microfluidic device and methods of using the same, for example, for nucleic acid amplification and detection (e.g., by using a microarray) . Background With the development of molecular diagnostics, nucleic acid analysis is widely employed in areas such as clinical examination, forensic identification, food testing, and academic research. Since the amount of samples subjected to nucleic acid analysis is usually small, and the amount of target molecules in the samples is usually in trace amounts, amplification of a target nucleotide sequence before detection or quantification is often needed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of the most prevalent techniques to amplify specific segments of DNA. Once amplified, the DNA may be detected by a variety of techniques, for example, real-time fluorescence detection, gel electrophoresis, capillary electrophoresis, and microarray detection. Microarray technology, which can sensitively and simultaneously measure multiple specific target DNA sequences within a sample, is widely used in diagnostics. Traditional methods of microarray analysis require the following processing steps: nucleic acid amplification, mixing products with hybridization reagents, transferring the mixture to a hybridization chamber, incubating the hybridization reaction, washing, and detection. A variety of commercial instruments, such as microarray hybridizers, clean-up stations, and microarray scanners, are available to perform each individual processing step. However, each individual processing step requires a corresponding device, and manual operation is needed to add and/or transfer reagents between experimental runs and to transfer the sample from one device to another. In the process of transferring amplified products to the microarray chamber, amplified PCR products would be exposed to air, which could easily cause sample cross-contamination. As a result, it is desirable to have an integrate device that possesses both amplification and detection functions, so that carry-over contamination of PCR products can be eliminated or reduced. One type of devices uses robotic arms to transfer reagents and/or sample between different reaction steps, including nucleic acid amplification, hybridization detection, and purification of nucleic acid before amplification. This type of devices includes, for example, the TruSentryTM System (AkonniBiosystems) , and the Prove-itTM StripArray (Mibidiag) . However, these devices transfer solutions in an open system, and can cause cross-contamination in the open system. Several cassettes or microfluidic devices are known for analyzing nucleic acid in a closed environment. These devices integrate a numbers of elements and structures to allow functions for performing amplification and microarray hybridization. For example, US2010/0291668 discloses the iCubate System (Icubate) using a cassette comprising reagent chambers, detection chambers, and cassette pipette for transferring specimens. The pipette could be moved vertically and horizontally within the cassette under the control of an external base unit. US2013/0130267 provides the UnyveroTM Solution (Curetis AG) system using a reaction vessel for performing PCR, above which is provided a specific porous membrane with immobilized microarray probes. Hybridization works by pneumatically controlling liquid to move up and down. US 8,852,919 discloses the Rheonix CARDTM (Rheonix) system which configures membrane-based valves and pneumatic pumps to control reagent transfer between different chambers assembled on a microfluidic device. These devices are small, but they are often in complex geometries and are based on multiple fluid manipulations that are hard to achieve. In addition, complicated fabrication technologies are needed for bonding microfluidic devices to make them withstand high pressure during thermal cycling without causing distortion to fine structures of the devices. Therefore, there is need for an inexpensive microfluidic device that is easy for fluid processing and device fabrication.

A. Definitions As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms “a, ” “an, ” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. For example, “a” or “an” means “at least one” or “one or more. ” Thus, reference to “a reagent” refers to one or more reagents, and reference to “the method” includes reference to equivalent steps and methods disclosed herein and/or known to those skilled in the art, and so forth. As used herein, the term “microfluidic device” generally refers to a device through which materials, particularly fluid borne materials, such as liquids, can be transported, in some embodiments on a micro-scale, and in some embodiments on a nanoscale.

Thus, these terms include, for example, 3' -deoxy-2' , 5' -DNA, oligodeoxyribonucleotide N3′ to P5' phosphoramidates, 2' -O-alkyl-substituted RNA, hybrids between DNA and RNA or between PNAs and DNA or RNA, and also include known types of modifications, for example, labels, alkylation, "caps, " substitution of one or more of the nucleotides with an analog, intemucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoramidates, carbamates, etc. ) , with negatively charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc. ) , and with positively charged linkages (e.g., aminoalkylphosphoramidates, aminoalkylphosphotriesters) , those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (including enzymes (e.g. nucleases) , toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, poly-L-lysine, etc. ) , those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc. ) , those containing chelates (of, e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc. ) , those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc. ) , as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide or oligonucleotide. It will be appreciated that, as used herein, the terms "nucleoside" and "nucleotide" will include those moieties which contain not only the known purine and pyrimidine bases, but also other heterocyclic bases which have been modified. Such modifications include methylated purines or pyrimidines, acylated purines or pyrimidines, or other heterocycles. Modified nucleosides or nucleotides can also include modifications on the sugar moiety, e.g., wherein one or more of the hydroxyl groups are replaced with halogen, aliphatic groups, or are functionalized as ethers, amines, or the like. The term "nucleotidic unit" is intended to encompass nucleosides and nucleotides. "Nucleic acid probe" and "probe" are used interchangeably and refer to a structure comprising a polynucleotide, as defined above, that contains a nucleic acid sequence that can bind to a corresponding target. The polynucleotide regions of probes may be composed of DNA, and/or RNA, and/or synthetic nucleotide analogs. As used herein, “complementary or matched” means that two nucleic acid sequences have at least 50％sequence identity. Preferably, the two nucleic acid sequences have at least 60％, 70％, 80％, 90％, 95％, 96％, 97％, 98％, 99％or 100％of sequence identity. “Complementary or matched” also means that two nucleic acid sequences can hybridize under low, middle and/or high stringency condition (s) . The percentage of sequence identity or homology is calculated by comparing one to another when aligned to corresponding portions of the reference sequence. As used herein, “substantially complementary or substantially matched" means that two nucleic acid sequences have at least 90％sequence identity. Preferably, the two nucleic acid sequences have at least 95％, 96％, 97％, 98％, 99％or 100％of sequence identity. Alternatively, “substantially complementary or substantially matched" means that two nucleic acid sequences can hybridize under high stringency condition (s) . The percentage of sequence identity or homology is calculated by comparing one to another when aligned to corresponding portions of the reference sequence. In general, the stability of a hybrid is a function of the ion concentration and temperature. Typically, a hybridization reaction is performed under conditions of lower stringency, followed by washes of varying, but higher, stringency. Moderately stringent hybridization refers to conditions that permit a nucleic acid molecule such as a probe to bind a complementary nucleic acid molecule. The hybridized nucleic acid molecules generally have at least 60％identity, including for example at least any of 70％, 75％, 80％, 85％, 90％, or 95％identity. Moderately stringent conditions are conditions equivalent to hybridization in 50％formamide, 5x Denhardt’s solution, 5x SSPE, 0.2％SDS at 42℃, followed by washing in 0.2x SSPE, 0.2％SDS, at 42℃. High stringency conditions can be provided, for example, by hybridization in 50％formamide, 5x Denhardt’s solution, 5x SSPE, 0.2％SDS at 42℃, followed by washing in 0.1x SSPE, and 0.1％SDS at 65℃. Low stringency hybridization refers to conditions equivalent to hybridization in 10％formamide, 5x Denhardt’s solution, 6x SSPE, 0.2％SDS at 22℃, followed by washing in 1x SSPE, 0.2％SDS, at 37℃. Denhardt’s solution contains 1％Ficoll, 1％polyvinylpyrolidone, and 1％bovine serum albumin (BSA) . 20x SSPE (sodium chloride, sodium phosphate, ethylene diamide tetraacetic acid (EDTA) ) contains 3M sodium chloride, 0.2M sodium phosphate, and 0.025 M EDTA. Other suitable moderate stringency and high stringency hybridization buffers and conditions are well known to those of skill in the art and are described, for example, in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, N. Y. (1989) ； and Ausubel et al., Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 4th ed., John Wiley &Sons (1999) . Alternatively, substantial complementarity exists when an RNA or DNA strand will hybridize under selective hybridization conditions to its complement. Typically, selective hybridization will occur when there is at least about 65％complementary over a stretch of at least 14 to 25 nucleotides, preferably at least about 75％, more preferably at least about 90％complementary. See M. Kanehisa Nucleic Acids Res. 12: 203 (1984) . The terms "homologous, " "substantially homologous, " and "substantial homology" as used herein denote a sequence of amino acids having at least 50％, 60％, 70％, 80％or 90％identity wherein one sequence is compared to a reference sequence of amino acids. The percentage of sequence identity or homology is calculated by comparing one to another when aligned to corresponding portions of the reference sequence. A “primer” used herein can be an oligonucleotide, either natural or synthetic, that is capable, upon forming a duplex with a polynucleotide template, of acting as a point of initiation of nucleic acid synthesis and being extended from its 3' end along the template so that an extended duplex is formed. The sequence of nucleotides added during the extension process is determined by the sequence of the template polynucleotide. Primers usually are extended by a polymerase, for example, a DNA polymerase. "Multiplexing" or “multiplex assay" herein refers to an assay or other analytical method in which the presence of multiple target molecules can be assayed simultaneously, e.g., by using more than one detection characteristic, e.g., fluorescence characteristic (for example excitation wavelength, emission wavelength, emission intensity, FWHM (full width at half maximum peak height) , or fluorescence lifetime) .

In some embodiments, the microfluidic device further comprises a control subsystem. In specific embodiments, a schematic diagram of a control subsystem of the microfluidic device is shown in Figure 2. In certain aspects, the control subsystem comprises a fluid control subsystem, an optical subsystem, and/or a thermal control subsystem.

C. Target Polynucleotide The target polynucleotide to be detected by using the device herein can be single-stranded, double-stranded, or higher order, and can be linear or circular. Exemplary single-stranded target polynucleotides include mRNA, rRNA, tRNA, hnRNA, microRNA, ssRNA or ssDNA viral genomes and viroids, although these polynucleotides may contain internally complementary sequences and significant secondary structure. Exemplary double-stranded target polynucleotides include genomic DNA, mitochondrial DNA, chloroplast DNA, dsRNA or dsDNA viral genomes, plasmids, phages, shRNA (a small hairpin RNA or short hairpin RNA) , and siRNA (small/short interfering RNA) . The target polynucleotide can be prepared recombinantly, synthetically, purified from a biological source or a combination thereof. The target polynucleotide may be purified to remove or diminish one or more undesired components of the sample or to concentrate the target polynucleotide prior to amplification. Conversely, where the target polynucleotide is too concentrated for a particular assay, the target polynucleotide may first be diluted. Following sample collection and optional nucleic acid extraction and purification, the nucleic acid portion of the sample comprising the target polynucleotide can be subjected to one or more preparative treatments. These preparative treatments can include in vitro transcription (IVT) , labeling, fragmentation, amplification and other reactions, which can be performed using the device disclosed herein. mRNA can first be treated with reverse transcriptase and a primer, which can be the first primer comprising the target non-complementary region, to create cDNA prior to detection and/or further amplification； this can be done in vitro with extracted or purified mRNA or in situ , e.g., in cells or tissues affixed to a slide. Nucleic acid amplification increases the copy number of sequences of interest and can be used to incorporate a label into an amplification product produced from the target polynucleotide using a labeled primer or labeled nucleotide. A variety of amplification methods are suitable for use, including the polymerase chain reaction method (PCR) , transcription mediated amplification (TMA) , the ligase chain reaction (LCR) , self sustained sequence replication (3SR) , nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) , rolling circle amplification (RCA) , loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) , the use of Q Beta replicase, reverse transcription, nick translation, and the like, particularly where a labeled amplification product can be produced and utilized in the methods taught herein. Any nucleotides may be detected by the present devices and methods. Examples of such nucleotides include AMP, GMP, CMP, UMP, ADP, GDP, CDP, UDP, ATP, GTP, CTP, UTP, dAMP, dGMP, dCMP, dTMP, dADP, dGDP, dCDP, dTDP, dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP. In some embodiments, the target polynucleotide does not have a label directly incorporated in the sequence. When the target polynucleotide is made with a directly incorporated label or so that a label can be directly bound to the target polynucleotide, this label is one which does not interfere with detection of the capture probe conjugate substrate and/or the report moiety label. Where the target polynucleotide is single-stranded, the first cycle of amplification forms a primer extension product complementary to the target polynucleotide. If the target polynucleotide is single-stranded RNA, a reverse transcriptase is used in the first amplification to reverse transcribe the RNA to DNA, and additional amplification cycles can be performed to copy the primer extension products. The primers for a PCR must, of course, be designed to hybridize to regions in their corresponding template that will produce an amplifiable segment； thus, each primer must hybridize so that its 3' nucleotide is base-paired with a nucleotide in its corresponding template strand that is located 3' from the 3' nucleotide of the primer used to prime the synthesis of the complementary template strand. The target polynucleotide may be amplified by contacting one or more strands of the target polynucleotide with a primer and a polymerase having suitable activity to extend the primer and copy the target polynucleotide to produce a full-length complementary polynucleotide or a smaller portion thereof. Any enzyme having a polymerase activity which can copy the target polynucleotide can be used, including DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases, reverse transcriptases, enzymes having more than one type of polymerase activity. The polymerase can be thermolabile or thermostable. Mixtures of enzymes can also be used. Exemplary enzymes include: DNA polymerases such as DNA Polymerase I ("Pol I") , the Klenow fragment of Pol I, T4, T7, SequenaseTM T7, SequenaseTM Version 2.0 T7, Tub, Taq, Tth, Pfx, Pfu, Tsp, Tfl, Tli and Pyrococcus sp GB-D DNA polymerases； RNA polymerases such as E. coli, SP6, T3 and T7 RNA polymerases； and reverse transcriptases such as AMV, M-MuLV, MMLV, RNAse H minus MMLV (SuperScriptTM) , SuperScriptTM II, ThermoScriptTM, HIV-1, and RAV2 reverse transcriptases. All of these enzymes are commercially available. Exemplary polymerases with multiple specificities include RAV2 and Tli (exo-) polymerases. Exemplary thermostable polymerases include Tub, Taq, Tth, Pfx, Pfu, Tsp, Tfl, Tli and Pyrococcus sp. GB-D DNA polymerases. Suitable reaction conditions are chosen to permit amplification of the target polynucleotide, including pH, buffer, ionic strength, presence and concentration of one or more salts, presence and concentration of reactants and cofactors such as nucleotides and magnesium and/or other metal ions, optional co-solvents, temperature, thermal cycling profile for amplification schemes comprising a polymerase chain reaction, and may depend in part on the polymerase being used as well as the nature of the sample. Co-solvents include formamide (typically at from about 2 to about 10％) , glycerol (typically at from about 5 to about 10％) , and DMSO (typically at from about 0.9 to about 10％) . Techniques may be used in the amplification scheme in order to minimize the production of false positives or artifacts produced during amplification. These include "touchdown" PCR, hot-start techniques, use of nested primers, or designing PCR primers so that they form stem-loop structures in the event of primer-dimer formation and thus are not amplified. Techniques to accelerate PCR can be used, for example centrifugal PCR, which allows for greater convection within the sample, and comprising infrared heating steps for rapid heating and cooling of the sample. One or more cycles of amplification can be performed. An excess of one primer can be used to produce an excess of one primer extension product during PCR； preferably, the primer extension product produced in excess is the amplification product to be detected. A plurality of different primers may be used to amplify different regions of a particular polynucleotide within the sample. Where the amplification reaction comprises multiple cycles of amplification with a polymerase, as in PCR, it is desirable to dissociate the primer extension product (s) formed in a given cycle from their template (s) . The reaction conditions are therefore altered between cycles to favor such dissociation； typically this is done by elevating the temperature of the reaction mixture, but other reaction conditions can be altered to favor dissociation, for example lowering the salt concentration and/or raising the pH of the solution in which the double-stranded polynucleotide is dissolved. Although it is preferable to perform the dissociation in the amplification reaction mixture, the polynucleotides may be first isolated using any effective technique and transferred to a different solution for dissociation, then reintroduced into an amplification reaction mixture for additional amplification cycles. In some aspects, the assay disclosed herein can be multiplexed, e.g., multiple distinct assays can be run simultaneously, by using different pairs of primers directed at different targets, which can be unrelated targets, or different alleles or subgroups of alleles from, or chromosomal rearrangements at, the same locus. This allows the quantitation of the presence of multiple target polynucleotides in a sample (e.g., specific genes in a cDNA library) . All that is required is an ability to uniquely identify the different second polynucleotide extension products in such an assay, through either a unique capture sequence or a unique label. Amplified target polynucleotides may be subjected to post-amplification treatments, for example, by interacting with one or more reagents from the reagent reservoir. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to fragment the amplification products prior to hybridization with a polynucleotide array, in order to provide segments which are more readily accessible and which avoid looping and/or hybridization to multiple capture probes. Fragmentation of the polynucleotides can be carried out by any method producing fragments of a size useful in the assay being performed； suitable physical, chemical and enzymatic methods are known in the art. Amplified target polynucleotides may also be coupled to the particles, either directly or through modifications to the polynucleotides and/or the particles. In some embodiments, the target polynucleotides are modified, such as biotinylation. In some other embodiments, the particles are modified with a functional group, such as streptavidin, neutravidin, avidin, etc. The target polynucleotides may be coupled to the particles through such modifications and functional groups. For double stranded polynucleotides, following the coupling of the target polynucleotides to the particles, single-stranded target polynucleotides can be prepared by denaturation methods by a chemical reaction, enzyme or heating, or a combination thereof, while coupled to the particles. In some embodiments, the chemical reaction uses urea, formamide, methanol, ethanol, an enzyme, or NaOH. In some embodiments, enzymatic methods include exonuclease and Uracil-N-glycosylase. In some other embodiments, the double-stranded target polynucleotide is heat denatured at an appropriate temperature from about 30℃to about 95℃. The method of the present disclosure is suitable for use in a homogeneous multiplex analysis of multiple target polynucleotides in a sample. Multiple target polynucleotides can be generated by amplification of a sample by multiple amplification oligonucleotide primers or sets of primers, each primer or set of primers specific for amplifying a particular polynucleotide target sequence. For example, a sample can be analyzed for the presence of multiple viral polynucleotide target sequences by amplification with primers specific for amplification of each of multiple viral target sequences, including, e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) , hepatitis B virus (HBV) , hepatitis C virus (HCV) , hepatitis A virus (HAV) , parvovirus B19, West Nile Virus, hantavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS) , etc. The portion of the sample comprising or suspected of comprising the target polynucleotide can be any source of biological material which comprises polynucleotides that can be obtained from a living organism directly or indirectly, including cells, tissue or fluid, and the deposits left by that organism, including viruses, mycoplasma, and fossils. The sample can also comprise a target polynucleotide prepared through synthetic means, in whole or in part. Typically, the sample is obtained as or dispersed in a predominantly aqueous medium. Non-limiting examples of the sample include blood, plasma, urine, semen, milk, sputum, mucus, a buccal swab, a vaginal swab, a rectal swab, an aspirate, a needle biopsy, a section of tissue obtained for example by surgery or autopsy, plasma, serum, spinal fluid, lymph fluid, the external secretions of the skin, respiratory, intestinal, and genitourinary tracts, tears, saliva, tumors, organs, samples of in vitro cell culture constituents (including but not limited to conditioned medium resulting from the growth of cells in cell culture medium, putatively virally infected cells, recombinant cells, and cell components) , and a recombinant source, e.g., a library, comprising polynucleotide sequences. The sample can be a positive control sample which is known to contain the target polynucleotide or a surrogate thereof. A negative control sample can also be used which, although not expected to contain the target polynucleotide, is suspected of containing it, and is tested in order to confirm the lack of contamination by the target polynucleotide of the reagents used in a given assay, as well as to determine whether a given set of assay conditions produces false positives (a positive signal even in the absence of target polynucleotide in the sample) . The sample can be diluted, dissolved, suspended, extracted or otherwise treated to solubilize and/or purify any target polynucleotide present or to render it accessible to reagents which are used in an amplification scheme or to detection reagents. Where the sample contains cells, the cells can be lysed or permeabilized to release the polynucleotides within the cells. Permeabilization buffers can be used to lyse cells which allow further steps to be performed directly after lysis, for example a polymerase chain reaction. The target polynucleotide may be double stranded or single stranded. In some embodiments, at least a portion of the single-stranded target polynucleotide is completely or substantially complementary to at least a portion of the oligonucleotide probe immobilized on the microarray. In other embodiments, the single-stranded target polynucleotide is completely complementary to the oligonucleotide probe immobilized on the microarray. The target polynucleotide may be subject to an in vitro manipulation, which may produce single-stranded or double-stranded polynucleotide fragments. The target polynucleotide may be labeled with a luminophore before the in vitro manipulation, during the in vitro manipulation, or after the in vitro manipulation. In one embodiment, physical treatment is employed including laser, ultrasonication, heat, microwave, piezoelectricity, electrophoresis, dielectrophoresis, solid phase adhesion, filtration and fluidic stress. In another embodiment, the in vitro manipulation is selected from the group consisting of enzymatic digestion, isothermal amplification, PCR amplification, reverse-transcription, reverse-transcription PCR amplification, allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) , single-base extension (SBE) , allele specific primer extension (ASPE) , restriction enzyme digestion, strand displacement amplification (SDA) , transcription mediated amplification (TMA) , ligase chain reaction (LCR) , nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA) , primer extension, rolling circle amplification (RCA) , self sustained sequence replication (3SR) , the use of Q Beta replicase, nick translation, and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) . For the double-stranded target polynucleotide, they may be denatured by any suitable method, e.g., a chemical reaction, an enzymatic reaction or physical treatment such as heating, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the chemical reaction uses urea, formamide, methanol, ethanol, sodium hydroxide, or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, enzymatic methods include exonuclease and Uracil-N-glycosylase treatment. In other embodiments, the double-stranded target polynucleotide is heat denatured at an appropriate temperature from about 30℃to about 95℃. D. Microarrays In a high-throughput manner, microarray technologies enable the evaluation of up to tens of thousands of molecular interactions simultaneously. Microarrays have made significant impact on biology, medicine, drug discovery. DNA microarray-based assays have been widely used, including the applications for gene expression analysis, genotyping for mutations, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) , and short tandem repeats (STRs) . And polypeptide and chemical microarrays have emerged as two important tools in the field of proteomics. Chemical microarray, a form of combinatorial libraries, can also be used for lead identification, as well as optimization of these leads. In this era of bioterrorism, the development of a microarray capable of detecting a multitude of biological or chemical agents in the environment will be of great interest to the law enforcement agencies. According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, assay methods for analysis of molecular interactions are provided. According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, assay methods for multiplexed analysis of target polynucleotides are provided. The target molecules include polynucleotides, polypeptides, antibodies, small molecule compounds, peptides, and carbohydrates. As those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, the present disclosure has an enormous number of applications, especially in assays and techniques for pharmaceutical development and diagnostics. The assays may be designed, for example, to detect polynucleotide molecules associated with any of a number of infectious or pathogenic agents including fungi, bacteria, mycoplasma, rickettsia, chlamydia, viruses, and protozoa, or to detect polynucleotide fragments associated with sexually transmitted disease, pulmonary disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, cardiovascular disorders, etc. A microarray is a multiplex technology widely used in molecular biology and medicine. Microarrays can be fabricated using a variety of technologies, including printing with fine-pointed pins, photolithography using pre-made masks, photolithography using dynamic micromirror devices, ink-jet printing, microcontact printing, or electrochemistry on microelectrode arrays. In standard microarrays, the probe molecules are attached via surface engineering to a solid surface of supporting materials, which include glass, silicon, plastic, hydrogels, agaroses, nitrocellulose and nylon. The microarray results for the detection of fluorescence-labeled target molecules can be viewed with a suitable method, e.g., by a CCD in bright field (left panel) , under a fluorescence microscopy (middle panel) , and by a commercial fluorescence microarray scanner with pseudo-color processing (right panel) . For DNA microarray, it comprises an arrayed series of microscopic spots of DNA oligonucleotides, known as probes. This can be a short section of a gene or other DNA element that are used to hybridize a complementary polynucleotide sample (called target) under stringent conditions. Targets in solution are usually detected and quantified by detection of fluorophore-, silver-, or chemiluminescence-labeled targets hybridized on microarray. Since an array can contain several to tens of thousands of probes, a microarray experiment can accomplish many genetic tests in parallel. The systems described herein may comprise two or more probes that detect the same target polynucleotide. For example, in some embodiments where the system is a microarray, the probes may be present in multiple (such as any of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or more) copies on the microarray. In some embodiments, the system comprises different probes that detect the same target polynucleotide. For example, these probes may bind to different (overlapping or non-overlapping) regions of the target polynucleotide. Any probes that are capable of determining the levels of target polynucleotide can be used. In some embodiments, the probe may be an oligonucleotide. It is understood that, for detection of target polynucleotides, certain sequence variations are acceptable. Thus, the sequence of the oligonucleotides (or their complementary sequences) may be slightly different from those of the target polynucleotides described herein. Such sequence variations are understood by those of ordinary skill in the art to be variations in the sequence that do not significantly affect the ability of the oligonucleotide to determine target polynucleotide levels. For example, homologs and variants of these oligonucleotide molecules possess a relatively high degree of sequence identity when aligned using standard methods. Oligonucleotide sequences encompassed by the present disclosure have at least 40％, including for example at least about any of 50％, 60％, 70％, 80％, 90％, 95％, 99％, or 100％sequence identity to the sequence of the target polynucleotides described herein. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide comprises a portion for detecting the target polynucleotides and another portion. Such other portion may be used, for example, for attaching the oligonucleotides to a substrate. In some embodiments, the other portion comprises a non-specific sequence (such as poly-T or poly-dT) for increasing the distance between the complementary sequence portion and the surface of the substrate. The oligonucleotides for the systems described herein include, for example, DNA, RNA, PNA, ZNA, LNA, combinations thereof, and/or modified forms thereof. They may also include a modified oligonucleotide backbone. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotide comprises at least about any of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or more continuous oligonucleotides complementary or identical to all or part of target polynucleotides described herein. A single oligonucleotide may comprise two or more such complementary sequences. In some embodiments, there may be a reactive group (such as an amine) attached to the 5’ or 3’ end of the oligonucleotide for attaching the oligonucleotide to a substrate. In some embodiments, the probes are oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides forming the array may be attached to the substrate by any number of ways including, but not limiting to, (i) in situ synthesis (e.g., high-density oligonucleotide arrays) using photolithographic techniques； (ii) spotting/printing at medium to low density on glass, silicon, nylon or nitrocellulose； (iii) masking； and (iv) dot-blotting on a nylon or nitrocellulose hybridization membrane. Oligonucleotides may also be non-covalently immobilized on the substrate by binding to anchors in a fluid phase such as in microtiter wells, microchannels or capillaries. Several techniques are well-known in the art for attaching polynucleotides to a solid substrate such as a glass slide. One method is to incorporate modified bases or analogs that contain a moiety that is capable of attachment to a solid substrate, such as an amine group, a derivative of an amine group or another group with a positive charge, into the amplified polynucleotides. The amplified product is then contacted with a solid substrate, such as a glass slide, which may be coated with an aldehyde or another reactive group which can form a covalent link with the reactive group that is on the amplified product and become covalently attached to the glass slide. Microarrays comprising the amplified products can be fabricated using a Biodot (BioDot Inc., Irvine, CA) spotting apparatus and aldehyde-coated glass slides (CEL Associates, Houston, TX) . Amplification products can be spotted onto the aldehyde-coated slides, and processed according to published procedures (Schena et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. (1995) , 93: 10614-10619) . Arrays can also be printed by robotics onto glass, nylon (Ramsay, G., Nature Biotechnol. (1998) , 16: 40-44) , polypropylene (Matson, et al., Anal Biochem. (1995) , 224 (1) : 110-6) , and silicone slides (Marshall and Hodgson, Nature Biotechnol. (1998) , 16: 27-31) . Other approaches to array assembly include fine micropipetting within electric fields (Marshall, and Hodgson, Nature Biotechnol. (1998) , 16: 27-31) , and spotting the polynucleotides directly onto positively coated plates. Methods such as those using amino propyl silicon surface chemistry are also known in the art, as disclosed at cmgm. stanford. edu/pbrown/. The assays of the present disclosure may be implemented in a multiplex format. Multiplex methods are provided employing 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000 or more different capture probes which can be used simultaneously to assay for amplification products from corresponding different target polynucleotides. In some embodiments, multiplex methods can also be used to assay for polynucleotide target sequences which have not undergone an amplification procedure. Methods amenable to multiplexing, such as those taught herein, allow acquisition of greater amounts of information from smaller specimens. The need for smaller specimens increases the ability of an investigator to obtain samples from a larger number of individuals in a population to validate a new assay or simply to acquire data, as less invasive techniques are needed. Where different substrates are included in a multiplex assay as part of the capture probe conjugates, the different substrates can be encoded so that they can be distinguished. Any encoding scheme can be used； conveniently, the encoding scheme can employ one or more different fluorophores, which can be fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystals. High density spectral coding schemes can be used. One or more different populations of spectrally encoded capture probe conjugates can be created, each population comprising one or more different capture probes attached to a substrate comprising a known or determinable spectral code comprising one or more semiconductor nanocrystals or fluorescent nanoparticle. Different populations of the conjugates, and thus different assays, can be blended together, and the assay can be performed in the presence of the blended populations. The individual conjugates are scanned for their spectral properties, which allows the spectral code to be decoded and thus identifies the substrate, and therefore the capture probe (s) to which it is attached. Because of the large number of different semiconductor nanocrystals and fluorescent nanoparticles and combinations thereof which can be distinguished, large numbers of different capture probes and amplification products can be simultaneously interrogated. In one embodiment, the microarray comprises at least two probe molecules. In another embodiment, the microarray comprises multiple oligonucleotide probes. In yet another embodiment, the probe molecule is selected from the group consisting of a polynucleotide, a polypeptide, an antibody, a small molecule compound, a peptide and a carbohydrate. In one embodiment, the single-stranded target polynucleotide obtained may comprise an artificially designed and optimized polynucleotide sequence such as a Tag sequence. In yet another embodiment, the microarray comprises a universal Tag array. In still another embodiment, the Tag sequences are complementary or substantially complementary to the oligonucleotide probes on the universal Tag array. The Tm difference between different Tag sequences can be set at any suitable range, e.g., equals to or is less than about 5℃. In some embodiments, the Tag sequences have no cross-hybridization among themselves. In some other embodiments, the Tag sequences have low homology to the genomic DNA of the species. In preferred embodiments, the Tag sequences have no hair-pin structures. In one embodiment, the Tag sequence is a single stranded oligonucleotide or modified analog. In another embodiment, the Tag sequence is a locked nucleic acid (LNA) , a zip nucleic acid (ZNA) or a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) . In yet another embodiment, the Tag sequence is introduced to the target polynucleotide during an in vitro manipulation. E.

Genetic hearing loss mutation detection kit (microarray method) (CapitalBio Corporation, Beijing, China) was used for the analysis. Dried blood on filter paper was collected as the test sample. Extraction of blood sample was processed according to kit instructions. Extracted DNA was mixed with PCR reagents in the kit. The PCR mixture was added to the sample reservoir using a pipette. The hybridization reagent was also added to the reagent reservoir. All the sample reservoirs and hybridization reservoir were covered by a lid during the assay. Then the device was initialized and placed into the instrument. The instrument automatically completed the remaining operation. 1. System initialization 1) Washing solution preparation: solution 1 (0.3X SSC and 0.1％SDS) was loaded into container 71 as shown in Figure 2, solution 2 (0.06X SSC) was loaded into container 72. 2) Fluid prefilling: pinch valve 47 was opened and bi-direction valve 49 was switched to close the “a” side and open the “b” side. Solution container 71 was in fluid communication with waste container 73 through tubes of the fluid control system and an inner flow path of the subsystem (inner flow path not shown) . The peristaltic pump moved in the counter-clockwise direction, and tubes of the fluid path were filled with liquid. Pinch valve 47 was then closed, and pinch valve 48 was opened. Pinch valve 49 was then switched to the other side ( “a” side open and “b” side closed) , and the other branch of the tubes of the fluid path were filled with liquid. 2.
