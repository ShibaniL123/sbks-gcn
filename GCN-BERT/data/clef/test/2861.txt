Example 10. Preparation of Monomer CM-1 (Comparative)
A 100 mL flask was charged with 1,1-difluoro-2-oxo-2-(4-vinylphenylamino)ethanesulfonyl fluoride (SM-3, 2.68 g, 9.60 mmol, 1.0 eq.), 2-hydroxy-2'-methoxyacetophenone (SM-5, 1.60 g, 9.60 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and THF (48 mL) under nitrogen stream and the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes at −30° C. n-BuLi (6.0 mL, 9.60 mmol, 1.0 eq. 1.6 M) was added dropwise to the mixture over 10 minutes. The mixture was stirred for 3.5 hours at −30° C. and allowed to warm to 10° C. 1N HCl (48 mL) was added to the reaction mixture that was extracted with AcOEt (144 mL), followed by 1N HCl (48 mL), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (24 mL) and brine (48 mL). The organic solution was subsequently dried over MgSO4. 2,2'-Methylene-bis(4-methyl-6-tert-butylphenol) (134 mg, 0.5 wt % based on weight of SM-3) was added as inhibitor. The solvents were removed by an evaporator and the resulting crude material was triturated with hexane (150 mL) for 30 minutes at 40° C. The solution was then decanted and this procedure was repeated twice. CH2Cl2 (150 mL) was added, largely dissolving the solid material and precipitating a sodium salt. This mixture was filtered over a bed of celite and the filtrate was concentrated by evaporator. Hexane (150 mL) was added to the crude material and the mixture was stirred for 15 hours at room temperature followed by heating for 2 hours at 40° C. The crude solids where filtered and recrystallized from a mixed solvent system (hexane/CHCl3, 50° C. to 0° C.) to yield the target PAG monomer as white solid (1.21 g, 29.6% yield).
