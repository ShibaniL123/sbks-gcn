Preparation (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-2-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl) oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine
4-Bromo-2,6-difluorobenzaldehyde (1.55 g, 7.02 mmol) was added to a solution of (R)-3-(2-((3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline (1.74 g, 3.51 mmol) in acetic acid (17 mL) and water (0.32 mL, 18 mmol), and the reaction was heated at 80Â° C. overnight. The reaction was concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was partitioned between EtOAc and saturated aqueous NaHCO3. The organic layer was concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 20 to 80% ethyl acetate in hexanes, to afford (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-2-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (1.33 g, 54.5%) as a solid.
