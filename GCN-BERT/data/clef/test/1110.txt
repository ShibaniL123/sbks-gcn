CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This reference claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/028,547, filed Feb. 18, 2008, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61,003,886, filed Nov. 21, 2007. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a respiratory preparation providing cough relief in a human comprising: a film forming agent; a thickening agent; and wherein said respiratory preparation provides on demand relief as needed. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Post nasal drip is caused by the over secretion of mucous in the nasal cavity. The constant trickle of mucus in the throat results in triggering the cough reflex. During colds (viral infections), inflammation may occur in the mucosa such that cytokines and inflammatory mediators are released into nasal secretions. These then bathe the throat and cause a sequence of pain/soreness that is much more easily aggravated by innocuous stimuli such as changes in air temperature (cold air) which stimulate the cough reflex. Additionally, the cough reflex can also be stimulated by a dry mouth and/or throat. Desensitization of the cough receptors in the throat is believed to provide antitussive effect via the mechanical action of shielding the receptors from further irritation. Cough receptors have been identified functionally and are present on the sensory nerve endings within the epithelium lining in the larynx and pharynx. Attempts have been made to alleviate this cough response by compositions such as cough drops, sore throat sprays, and cough syrups. The response of current cough drops is not instant and drops are usually solid doses that must be melted in the mouth and provide no coating of the throat. Sore throat sprays can contain actives that numb the mouth and throat. Sprays normally contain instruction to not swallow so there is no throat coating and no cough relief. Additionally, because they normally contain actives the product cannot be used often as needed. Cough syrups contain actives that must be absorbed by the blood which usually takes about 30 minutes for any type of cough relief, therefore there is no instant relief that is targeted for the throat. Additionally, it is believed that cough suppression can be enhanced by focused delivery of the active to the site of irritation, the target mucosa. The benefit of targeted delivery such as that which is realized when a spray is used, is that the actives are not lost to irreversible binding to the mucin (via mucoadhesion) before they can reach the target sites. Therefore, the various embodiments described herein provide for a respiratory preparation that provides instant and on demand cough relief in a portable form that can be used as often as needed. The preparation can be used to target the mouth and/or throat and provide a protective barrier that shields the epithelial cells that line the throat and thus prevents the stimulation of a cough response and/or triggers the flow of saliva and to help to hydrate the mouth and/or throat. The barrier can additionally aid in reducing inflammation of the mouth and/or throat and relive minor pain sometimes associated with a cough and/or sore throat.

Experimental Studies Experimental Study 1 Study Objectives The primary objective of this study was to obtain the data needed to determine the appropriate design (including sample size and choice of comparator) for a full-scale study to evaluate the effectiveness of the respiratory preparations in reducing cough frequency (measured via objective cough counts) during a 4-hour observation period relative to the chosen comparator (either a water control or reference therapy). Secondary Objectives were to Obtain a Preliminary Assessment of: the effectiveness of the respiratory preparations in reducing cough frequency (measured via objective cough counts) relative to a water control and reference therapy; andthe effectiveness of the respiratory preparations in reducing perceived cough frequency and severity relative to a water control and reference therapy; Tertiary Objectives were to Obtain a Preliminary Assessment of: the effectiveness of the respiratory preparations in providing faster, longer, and better perceived cough relief relative to a water control; andthe effectiveness of the respiratory preparations in providing better perceived coating of the throat relative to a water control. Quaternary Objectives are to Obtain a Preliminary Assessment of: the effectiveness of the respiratory preparations in reducing cough frequency (measured via objective cough counts) relative to a no treatment control;the effectiveness of the respiratory preparations in reducing perceived cough frequency and severity relative to a no treatment control;the effectiveness of the water control in reducing cough frequency (measured via objective cough counts) relative to a no treatment control; andthe effectiveness of the water control in reducing perceived cough frequency and severity relative to a no treatment control. Investigational Plan Study Design This was a randomized, parallel, partially single-blind, single-center, controlled study in adult males and females who were suffering from symptoms of common cold/flu but were otherwise healthy. Potential subjects were screened against the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria. Subjects who qualified to participate in the study were randomized into 1 of 5 test groups: Respiratory preparation 1 (approximately 40 subjects), Respiratory preparation 2 (approximately 40 subjects), a reference therapy (approximately 40 subjects), a water control (approximately 40 subjects), and a no treatment control (approximately 10 subjects). Qualified subjects remained at the study site throughout a 4-hour observation period. Subjects assigned to the no treatment control received no treatment during the 4-hour observation period. Subjects assigned to the reference therapy took a single dose of the 30 mg dextromethorphan HBr solution under supervision of study personnel at the beginning of the 4-hour observation period. Subjects in all other groups used their test product each time they felt the urge to cough throughout the 4-hour observation period. Continuous digital video and audio recordings were obtained throughout the 4-hour observation period. (The video and digital audio recordings were viewed/listened to by trained observers at a later time in order to obtain objective counts of cough bouts, individual coughs, and test product usage for each subject.) At 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours, subjects self-assessed the frequency and severity of their cough in the context of the previous hour. Subjects completed a Final Questionnaire immediately after completing the 4-hour observation period and after completing the 4-hour subjective assessment of cough frequency and severity. Selection of Study Population A target of approximately 170 adult male and female subjects suffering cold or flu-like symptoms and experiencing cough were enrolled and completed this study. Inclusion Criteria To be considered eligible for enrollment into this study, subjects must have: 1. been generally healthy by report and review of medication/medical history; 2. been at least 18 years of age and not older than 65 years of age; 3. if female, had a negative result for a urine pregnancy test administered at screening and reported they were not actively trying to conceive or lactating; 4. reported they were experiencing cold/flu-like symptoms with the first signs occurring no more than 10 days prior to Visit 1; 5. experienced at least 3 cough bouts during a 30 minute period at screening; 6. been willing and able to refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, and putting anything into their mouth other than their assigned test product for the duration of Visit 1; 7. been willing and able to sit in a room, staying alert and awake, with limited interaction for a period of approximately 4½ hours; 8. read, understood, signed, and received a copy of the Informed Consent and Confidentiality/Non-Disclosure Agreement prior to initiation of the study procedures. Visit 1 Screening/Enrollment In order to qualify for enrollment into the study, subjects must have experienced at least 3 cough bouts in the 30 minute period. They received a kitbox labeled with their assigned randomization number. With the exception of the no treatment control group, the kitboxes contained test product and usage instructions. 4-Hour Observation Period Subjects remained on site in the room in which they were screened throughout a 4-hour observation period. They were instructed to open their assigned kitbox and directed to use their assigned test product according to the instructions. Subjects assigned to the no treatment control received no test product to use during the 4-hour observation period. Subjects assigned to the reference therapy took a single dose of the 30 mg dextromethorphan hydrobromide solution under supervision of study personnel at the beginning of the 4-hour observation period. Subjects in all other groups used their test product each time they felt the urge to cough throughout the 4-hour observation period. Continuous digital video and audio recordings were obtained throughout the 4-hour observation period. At 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours, subjects self-assessed the frequency and severity of their cough in the context of the previous hour. Subjects were instructed to refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, and putting anything into their mouth other than their test product and to refrain from all activities with the exception of reading and paperwork. Subjects were allowed to use the restroom, if necessary. Study personnel monitored subjects to ensure they were alert and complied with study procedures and to answer any questions that subjects may have had. Efficacy Assessments Continuous Digital Video and Audio Recordings Digital video and audio recordings were obtained continuously throughout the 4-hour observation period. The video and audio recordings were made simultaneously and as part of the same digital file, for each subject using a single recording device. A network camera (IP camera) was the recording device used to create each digital audio/video file. For consistency, each observation room was outfitted with the same recording equipment. The feeds from each network camera ran to a central personal computer which was running software recording each network camera's audio/video feed to an individual digital file, later viewable by a media player software application. Trained observers viewed and listened to subjects' recordings in order to obtain objective counts of cough bouts, individual coughs, and test product usage. The number of individual coughs was quantified by counting the number of explosive sounds. An explosive sound is always present in a cough and is the characteristic sound we recognize as cough. In a series of individual coughs, each expiration was counted as 1 cough. The number of cough bouts was quantified by counting the number of series of individual coughs. Consecutive cough bouts were separated by inspirations. Test Groups Method of Assigning Subjects to Test Groups Subjects were randomly assigned to test groups in a 1:4:4:4:4 ratio (no treatment control, water control, reference therapy, respiratory preparation 1, respiratory preparation 2). Subjects were assigned randomization numbers (501-755) in increasing numerical order as they qualified for the study. Randomization numbers were randomly assigned to test groups in blocks of size 17. Subjects were identified throughout the study by unique subject numbers assigned as the subjects presented to the study site. Description of Test Groups/Usage Instructions FIG. 1 is Table 1 and shows a description of the test groups and brief usage instructions. Identity of Test Product A reference therapy of 30 mg DexM that is a commercially available product was overlabeled and packed. Test products and usage instructions were contained in a kitbox labeled with the randomization number, study number, caution statements, and other information as required by internal regulatory and clinical SOPs. Bottles were labeled with study number, applicable caution and warning statements, usage directions, and other information as dictated by internal regulatory requirements and clinical standard operating procedures. Product Compliance Subjects were sequestered on site and used the test products on site. Subjects assigned to the reference therapy were dosed under supervision of study personnel. All subjects were monitored through digital video and audio streams. This was a randomized, parallel, partially single-blind controlled study.

Percent of Evaluable Subjects Respiratory preparation 1 and 2 were each compared versus the No Treatment Control, Water Control, and Reference Therapy and the Water Control was compared versus the No Treatment Control with respect to percent of randomized subjects who were excluded from all evaluable subjects' analysis populations. These comparisons were made on a two-sided basis at a type I error rate of 0.10 using Fisher's exact test. No adjustments were made to control the experiment-wise type I error rate. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Descriptive statistics were calculated for both analysis populations (randomized subjects and evaluable subjects) by experimental group and displayed in tabular form. Respiratory preparation 1 and 2 were each compared versus the No Treatment Control, Water Control, and Reference Therapy for both analysis populations (randomized subjects and evaluable subjects). The Water Control was also compared versus the No Treatment Control for both populations. These comparisons were made on a two-sided basis at a type I error rate of 0.10 using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test (Age, Number of Bouts, Sore Throat, Rhinorrhea, Nasal Congestion, Cough, and Malaise), Fisher's exact test (Sex), and Pearson's χ2 test (Race). No adjustments were made to control the experiment-wise type I error rate. Efficacy Variables Statistical Comparisons The primary comparisons of interest were Respiratory preparation 1 and 2 versus the Water Control and Reference Therapy with respect to Number of Coughs in the 4-hour observation period. Of secondary interest were comparisons of Respiratory preparation 1 and 2 versus the Water Control and Reference Therapy with respect to: Number of Coughs in each 1-hour interval of the 4-hour observation period;Number of Cough Bouts in the 4-hour observation period;Number of Cough Bouts in each 1-hour interval of the 4-hour observation period;Perceived Cough Frequency and Perceived Cough Severity at each of 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours AND at the average across 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours. Of tertiary interest were comparisons of Respiratory preparation 1 and 2 versus the Water Control with respect to Perceived Onset of Cough Relief, Perceived Duration of Cough Relief, Perceived Level of Cough Relief, and Perceived Level of Coating of the Throat. Of quaternary interest were comparisons of Respiratory preparation 1 and 2 and the Water Control versus the No Treatment Control with respect to: Number of Coughs in the 4-hour observation period;Number of Coughs in each 1-hour interval of the 4-hour observation period;Number of Cough Bouts in the 4-hour observation period;Number of Cough Bouts in each 1-hour interval of the 4-hour observation period;Perceived Cough Frequency and Perceived Cough Severity at each of 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours AND at the average across 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours. For comparisons of the experimental groups with respect to Number of Coughs, Number of Cough Bouts, Perceived Cough Frequency, and Perceived Cough Severity (all time points), the following one-sided hypotheses were tested using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test: Number of Usages Descriptive statistics were calculated for the evaluable subjects analysis populations by experimental group (Respiratory preparation 1 and 2 and Water Control) and displayed in tabular form. Respiratory preparation 1 and 2 were each compared versus the Water Control with respect to number of usages for the evaluable subjects analysis populations. These comparisons were made on a two-sided basis at a type I error rate of 0.10 using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. No adjustments were made to control the experiment-wise type I error rate. Study Subjects Disposition of Subjects One hundred seventy-five subjects were randomized to the 5 treatment groups. Of these, 2 subjects did not complete the study and were dropped due to loud and disruptive behavior (Subject 0023; Water Control) and a voluntary withdrawal (Subject 0150; Water Control) FIG. 2 is Table 2 including a description of the Number of Subjects randomized to Treatment Groups. Efficacy Evaluation 0.1. Data Sets Analyzed Twelve subjects were excluded from all evaluable subjects' analysis populations: 6 Water Control; 3 Reference Therapy; 1 Respiratory preparation 1 and 2 Respiratory preparation 2. Eleven subjects were excluded because more than 10% of their cough data in the 4-hour observation period was not gradable due to audio/video outages: One subject was excluded because the subject did not comply with product usage instructions: Subject 0179 (Water Control). A significantly (α<0.10) higher percent of subjects were excluded in the Water Control treatment group compared with Respiratory preparation 1. Three subjects were excluded from the evaluable subjects' analysis populations for Number of Coughs, Number of Bouts, and Number of Usages for 1 or 2 hourly intervals because more than 10% of the cough/usage data for that interval was not gradable due to audio/video outages: Four subjects were excluded from the evaluable subjects' analysis populations for Number of Coughs, Number of Bouts, and Number of Usages for one hourly interval because more than 10% of the cough/usage data for that interval was not gradable due to their being out of the viewing room: Three subjects were excluded from the evaluable subjects' analysis populations for all the efficacy variables for 1 or 2 Hourly Subjective Assessments (and the average Hours 1-4) because it was more than 20% off-schedule: Two subjects were excluded from the evaluable subjects' analysis populations for an efficacy variable on an Hourly Subjective Assessment (and the average Hours 1-4) due to missing data: Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics Evaluable subjects were generally well balanced on the demographic characteristics. The overall mean age was 35.7 years; the majority of subjects were either Black (53%) or Caucasian (45%) with an almost even representation of males (55%) and females (45%). Randomized Subjects There were statistically significant differences (α<0.10) for Respiratory preparation 1 versus Water Control and Reference Therapy with respect to Number of Bouts, Respiratory preparation 2 versus Reference Therapy with respect to Rhinorrhea, and Water Control versus No Treatment Control with respect to Nasal Congestion. Evaluable Subjects There were statistically significant differences (α<0.10) for Respiratory preparation 1 versus Water Control with respect to Number of Bouts and Nasal Congestion, Respiratory preparation 1 versus Reference Therapy with respect to Number of Bouts, and Water Control versus No Treatment Control with respect to Nasal Congestion. All other two-sided comparisons of Respiratory preparation 1 and 2 versus the No Treatment Control, Water Control, and Reference Therapy and of the Water Control versus the No Treatment Control with respect to the demographic and other baseline characteristics were not significant at α=0.10.

Respiratory Preparation 2 Vs. No Treatment Control FIG. 6 is Table 6 which includes a description of the summary efficacy results for the Respiratory preparation 2 vs. No Treatment Control. The number of coughs, cough bouts, perceived cough frequency and perceived cough severity experienced by subjects who received Respiratory preparation 2 were significantly lower (α<0.10) than the No Treatment Control for all evaluations (at Hours 1, 2, 3, 4 and 1-4). Respiratory preparation 2 vs. Water Control FIG. 7 is Table 7 which includes a description of the Summary efficacy results for the Respiratory preparation 2 vs. Water Control. Number of Coughs and Perceived Cough Frequency experienced by subjects who received Respiratory preparation 2 were significantly lower (α<0.10) than the Water Control at Hours 2, 3, 4 and 1-4.Number of Cough Bouts experienced by subjects who received Respiratory preparation 2 was significantly lower (α<0.10) than the Water Control at Hours 2, 4 and 1-4.Perceived Cough Severity experienced by subjects who received Respiratory preparation 2 was significantly lower (α<0.10) than the Water Control at Hours 2 and 4.Perceived Onset of Cough Relief, Perceived Level of Cough Relief and Perceived Level of Throat Coating experienced by subjects who received Respiratory preparation 2 were significantly higher (α<0.10) than the Water Control at the final observation period (after 4 hours). Respiratory Preparation 2 Vs. Reference Therapy FIG. 8 is Table 8 which includes a description of the summary efficacy results for the Respiratory preparation 2 vs. Reference Therapy. Number of Coughs and Cough Bouts experienced by subjects who received Respiratory preparation 2 were significantly lower (α<0.10) than the Reference Therapy at Hours 1 and 2. Efficacy Conclusions Significantly fewer usages of both Respiratory preparation 1 and 2 were noted overall (1-4 hours) and at specific time points during the study compared with water control. Overall (Hours 1-4), Respiratory preparation 1 showed superiority over the No Treatment Control with significantly fewer number of coughs, cough bouts and perceived cough frequency. Further, at the final observation period, Perceived Onset of Cough Relief, Perceived Level of Cough Relief and Perceived Level of Throat Coating were significantly lower in subjects in the Respiratory preparation 1 group compared to the Water Control. Overall and for each time point of the analysis, Respiratory preparation 2 showed superiority over the No Treatment Control with significantly fewer number of coughs, cough bouts, perceived cough frequency and perceived cough severity. When compared with the Water Control, Respiratory preparation 2 showed superiority with a fewer Number of Coughs and Perceived Cough Frequency over all time points and overall except within the 1st hour and fewer Number of Cough Bouts overall and hours 2 and 4, individually. Further, at the final observation period, Perceived Onset of Cough Relief, Perceived Level of Cough Relief and Perceived Level of Throat Coating were significantly were significantly lower in subjects in the Respiratory preparation 2 group compared to the Water Control. Interestingly, simply lubricating the throat (Water Control) showed benefit on cough measures (Number of Coughs, Cough Bouts, Perceived Cough Frequency and Perceived Cough Severity) compared to No Treatment Control at all time points evaluated. For the primary comparisons of interest, there was a statistically significant difference with respect to reduced Number of Coughs in the 4-hour observation period for Respiratory preparation 2 compared to the Water Control, but not for Respiratory preparation 1. Overall (Hours 1-4), there was no difference in number of coughs for either device compared to Reference Therapy. Of secondary interest were comparisons of Respiratory preparation 1 and 2 versus the Water Control and Reference Therapy with respect to the Number of Coughs and Cough Bouts in each 1-hour interval of the 4-hour observation period, Number of Cough Bouts in the 4-hour observation period and Perceived Cough Frequency and Perceived Cough Severity at each of 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours and at the average across 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours. For Respiratory preparation 1 perceived cough frequency and perceived cough severity were significantly less at Hour 4 and hours 2, 4, and 1-4, respectively, that the Water Control. There was no difference in any other comparison of Respiratory preparation 1 vs the Water Control or any comparison with the Reference Therapy. For Respiratory preparation 2 vs the Water Control, Number of Coughs and Perceived Cough Frequency were significantly less at Hours 2, 3, 4, and 1-4, the Number of Cough Bouts were significantly less at Hours 2, 4, and 1-4, and Perceived Cough Severity was significantly less at Hours 2 and 4. For Respiratory preparation 2 vs the Reference Control, Number of Coughs and Cough Bouts were significantly less at Hours 1 and 2. Of tertiary interest were comparisons of Respiratory preparation 1 and 2 versus the Water Control with respect to Perceived Onset of Cough Relief, Perceived Duration of Cough Relief, Perceived Level of Cough Relief, and Perceived Level of Coating of the Throat. Perceived Onset of Cough Relief, Perceived Level of Cough Relief and Perceived Level of Throat Coating experienced by subjects who received Respiratory preparation 1 and 2 were significantly higher (α<0.10) than the Water Control at the final observation period. Of quaternary interest were comparisons of Respiratory preparation 1 and 2 and the Water Control versus the No Treatment Control with respect to the Number of Coughs and Number of Cough Bouts, Perceived Cough Frequency and Perceived Cough Severity at each individual time point and overall Hours 1-4. The number of coughs, cough bouts and perceived cough frequency experienced by subjects who received Respiratory preparation 1 were significantly lower (α<0.10) than the No Treatment Control at Hours 2, 3, 4 and 1-4. Perceived cough severity experienced by subjects who received Respiratory preparation 1 was significantly lower (α<0.10) than the No Treatment Control at Hours 1, 2, 3, 4 and 1-4. The number of coughs, cough bouts, perceived cough frequency and perceived cough severity experienced by subjects who received Respiratory preparation 2 were significantly lower (α<0.10) than the No Treatment Control for all evaluations (at Hours 1, 2, 3, 4 and 1-4). Overall these Results Demonstrate the Following: Consistent evidence of efficacy across all parameters for Respiratory preparation 2 relative to the water control more than Respiratory preparation 1. Large differences were observed for Respiratory preparation 2 relative to the water control. Experimental Study II This Experimental study is designed to evaluate using gamma scintigraphy the retention of a 5 mL volume of the respiratory preparation in the oral cavity and oropharynx when administered to the back of the tongue via a syringe. Two formulations will be tested. Study Objectives The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate: the total volume of an respiratory preparation retained in the oral cavity and oropharynx over a period of 1 hour following oral administration in healthy human volunteers using gamma scintigraphy, and the volume of the respiratory preparation retained in the oropharynx at the earliest measurable time period (as permitted by the method) following oral administration in healthy human volunteers using gamma scintigraphy. Secondary Objectives are to Evaluate: The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate: the total volume of the respiratory preparation retained in the esophagus over a period of 1 hour following oral administration in healthy human volunteers using gamma scintigraphy, and the total volume of a commercial device retained in the oral cavity, oropharynx and esophagus over a period of 1 hour following oral administration in healthy human volunteers using gamma scintigraphy. Investigational Plan Study Design This will be an open label single use, randomized, parallel study in adult healthy males. Potential subjects will be screened against the Inclusion/Exclusion criteria at Visit 1 such that a minimum of 40 are enrolled into the study and scheduled for Visit 2. A minimum of 32 subjects who qualify to continue in the study at Visit 2 will be administered a single usage of either the investigational or commercial device by Study Personnel. Retention of the radiolabeled devices in the oral cavity, oropharynx and esophagus will be monitored using gamma scintigraphy for 1 hour post-usage.

Scintigraphy Subjects will report to the study site at their designated time for Visit 2 no more than 30 days after Visit 1 and after refraining from eating and drinking for at least 2 hours. Subjects will be instructed to drink 4 ounces water and to refrain from additional eating and drinking until after they have completed the 1-hour scintigraphic acquisition. Study Personnel will prepare the bottles/syringes containing the assigned radiolabeled device for use in an appropriate manner and document in the batch record. Control (Commercially Available Product) (Reference Medical Device) Approximately 1 hour after drinking the 4 ounces of water, subjects will be administered 2 sprays of the radiolabeled reference medical device into the mouth for a total volume of approximately 0.35 mL. The reference medical device used is one intended for relief of dry mouth. Subjects will be instructed NOT to swallow for 60 seconds after the last spray. Study Personnel will notify subjects when swallowing can resume and record all swallows to the extent possible throughout the 1-hour scintigraphic acquisition. Within approximately 15 seconds of the last spray, the subject will be positioned with their chest facing the detector of the gamma camera and their head in a left lateral position, in contact with the front of the detector. Study Personnel will weigh the bottle containing the Reference Medical Device before and after administration. In addition, the bottle will be counted in the dose calibrator before and after administration. Subjects will then undergo the procedures for scintigraphic acquisition as described below. Subjects will be positioned with their chest facing the detector of the gamma camera and their head in a left lateral position and in contact with the front of the detector. Subjects will have a syringe containing 5 mL of the radiolabeled respiratory preparation inserted into their mouth and will be instructed to close their mouth around the syringe. A 15-second static image will be obtained. Approximately 1 hour after drinking the 4 ounces of water, Study Personnel will instruct subjects to open their mouth and will place 5 mL of the radiolabeled device on the back of the subject's tongue. Subjects will be instructed to swallow immediately after administration of the 5 mL. Study Personnel will record all swallows to the extent possible throughout the 1-hour scintigraphic acquisition. Within approximately 15 seconds of the administration, the subject will be positioned with their chest facing the detector of the gamma camera and their head in a left lateral position, in contact with the front of the detector. Study Personnel will weigh the syringe containing the respiratory preparation before and after administration. In addition, the syringe will be counted in the dose calibrator before and after administration. Subjects will then undergo the procedures for scintigraphic acquisition as described below. Scintigraphy Acquisition Scintigraphic acquisition will start approximately 15 seconds after device administration and will end 1 hour 15 seconds after device administration. A dynamic image set consisting of twelve continuous 15-second frames immediately followed by 54 continuous 30 second frames will be acquired in the first 30 minutes. Note that the dynamic imaging may be interrupted for a short interval (less than 30 seconds) during the last 15 minutes of this 30 minute period in the event that subjects experience discomfort. Every attempt will be made to acquire a continuous 30 minute interval, and if any interruption in imaging occurs, these frames will be excluded from data analysis. Once the dynamic image set is complete, the subject will be removed from the detector and allowed to relax while sitting near the gamma camera. The subject will be repositioned in front of the detector to obtain a 30-second static image every 5 minutes for the next 30 minutes. External radioactive sources (fiducials) will be placed on the subject (e.g. at the mid brow line and on the chin or elsewhere as deemed appropriate by Study Personnel) in order to account for subject movement and repositioning during static imaging sequences. Another external radioactive source may be used to outline the head, neck and shoulder as they appear within the field of view of the gamma camera. The subject will remain as quiet and motionless as possible and with their head in contact with the detector throughout the 30-minute dynamic image set and throughout each 30-second static image. Restraint tape may be used as a reminder to the subject to remain motionless during imaging. The subject will remain quiet and minimize any movement such as standing, walking, etc. during the time in between imaging. Identity of Commercially Available Product)(Reference Medical Device) and Respiratory preparation. FIG. 9 is Table 9 and shows a description of the respiratory preparation and Reference Medical Device. Radiolabeling Procedures The radionuclide used in this study is Technetium-99m (99mTc), in the form of 99mTc sodium-carboxymethyl cellulose (99mTc—NaCMC). Study personnel will radiolabel the sodium carboxymethyl cellulose with 99mTc following Sponsor approved procedures documented in Sponsor approved batch records. Study personnel will add the radiolabeled sodium-carboxymethyl cellulose to the Reference Medical Device and respiratory preparation on each study day (within 24 hours of administration to subjects). They will add the radiolabel in an appropriate volume to respiratory preparation and Reference Medical Device. They will also perform a confirmation of the radiolabel and activity. The homogeneity of each formulation will be determined and recorded in the respective master batch records. Preparation of the radiolabeled Reference Medical Device and respiratory preparation and handling radiopharmaceuticals will follow Sponsor approved procedures documented in Sponsor approved batch records. Device/Respiratory Preparation Administration Study Personnel will administer to each subject a single usage of the appropriate device/respiratory preparation, based on the randomization provided by the Sponsor, and document in master batch records or source documents. Study Personnel will administer the devices/respiratory preparation as follows: Respiratory Preparation: 5 mL of the preparation will be placed on the back of the subject's tongue using a 10 cc syringe. Subjects will be instructed to swallow immediately after administration of the 5 mL. Reference Medical Device™: 2 sprays of the device will be directed into the subject's mouth. Subjects will be instructed NOT to swallow for at least 60 seconds after administration. Before and after administration of the Reference Medical Device or Respiratory Preparation, the container (syringe or bottle) will be weighed in order to determine the total weight delivered to the subject. Radioactivity Exposure Subjects will receive one single administration of Reference Medical Device or respiratory preparation, which will contain the radioactive marker. Effectiveness Observations and Measurements Scintigraphy Analysis The raw radiation counts will be archived on computer disk and/or optical disk after being aligned and having removed the external markers from the images using ScinCam data acquisition software (Siemens Cameras 1 and 2: ScinCam Version 2.10, Build 001, Siemens Camera 3: ScinCam Version 2.00 Build 042, GE Camera: ScinCam Version 2.96+, Build 008) and ScinWin data analysis software (ScinWin Version 2.95, Build 013, GammaForge, Louisville, Ky.). Scintigraphic data analysis for each radionuclide will be performed on specialized Nuclear Mac software (Version 5.6) as follows: The sequential computer generated images will be reviewed for each subject and three regions of interest will be drawn to represent the oral cavity, oropharynx, and esophagus using Nuclear Mac software. All counts will be corrected for radioactivity decay and background. Elapsed time along with the radionuclide half life will be used to correct for radioactivity decay. For the background correction, an arbitrary region will be selected away from the throat on each image. The total number of radiation counts in this region will be divided by the total number of pixels, and this count per pixel will be subtracted from each pixel in each anatomical region of interest. Volume of Reference Medical Device retained for each combination of subject, image, and region of interest will be calculated by: corrected count÷concentration of radiation in the Reference Medical Device (sum of the adjusted counts across all regions of interest in the first 15-second image obtained after administration of the device÷the volume of Reference Medical Deviceadministered in mL). Volume of respiratory preparation retained for each combination of subject, image, and region of interest will be calculated by: corrected count÷concentration of radiation in the respiratory preparation (sum of the adjusted counts across all regions of interest in the 15-second image obtained prior to administration of the respiratory preparation divided by volume of respiratory administered in mL). Primary Endpoints Of Primary Interest Will be: Area under the curve from 0 to 60 minutes for volume of respiratory preparation retained in the oral cavity following administration and subject positioning, Area under the curve from 0 to 60 minutes for volume of respiratory preparation retained in the oropharynx following administration and subject positioning, and Volume of respiratory preparation retained in the oropharynx during the first 15-second frame following administration and subject positioning. Secondary Endpoints Of Secondary Interest Will be: Area under the curve from 0 to 60 minutes for volume of Reference Medical Device retained in the oral cavity following administration and subject positioning, Area under the curve from 0 to 60 minutes for volume of Reference Medical Device retained in the oropharynx following administration and subject positioning, and Area under the curve from 0 to 60 minutes for volume of Reference Medical Device retained in the esophagus following administration and subject positioning. Area under the curve from 0 to 60 minutes for volume of respiratory preparation retained in the esophagus following administration and subject positioning. Experimental Study III In the present trial, the respiratory preparation is being delivered to the back of the throat in a stream via a spray bottle. The study is designed to evaluate the retention of the respiratory preparation in the oral cavity, oropharynx, and esophagus using gamma scintigraphy. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the retention of a respiratory preparation in the oropharynx following oral administration in healthy human volunteers using gamma scintigraphy. Investigational Plan Study Design This will be a single usage, open label study in 16 adult healthy males. Sixteen subjects who qualify to continue in the study at Visit 2 will be administered a single usage of the respiratory preparation by Study Personnel. Retention of the radiolabeled respiratory preparation in the oral cavity, oropharynx and esophagus will be monitored using gamma scintigraphy for 1 hour post-usage. Inclusion Criteria To be considered eligible for enrollment into this study, subjects must: a. be generally healthy as determined by medical history, medication history, physical examination (including resting vital signs), ENT examination, and routine clinical laboratory tests (including CBC and blood chemistry); b. be male, between the ages of 18 and 40 years, inclusive; c. have fasted during the previous 8 hours; d. have read, understood, signed, and received a copy of the Informed Consent, HIPAA authorization and Confidentiality/Non-Disclosure Agreement prior to initiation of study procedures; e. demonstrate that they are able to tolerate administration of the respiratory preparation; f. be willing to refrain from gum, hard candies, caffeine, alcohol, tobacco/smoking/nicotine, cough suppressants, throat lozenges, or nasal, throat or lung inhalants for 24 hours prior to Visit 2; g. be willing to refrain from exercise for 24 hours prior to Visit 2; h. be willing and able to tolerate restricted movement, such as will be required during the scintigraphy procedures; and i. seem, in the opinion of the Investigator, motivated and capable of participating in the study; Study Procedures Visit 2 Scintigraphy Subjects will report to the study site at their designated time for Visit 2 Study site. no more than 10 days after Visit 1 and after refraining from eating and drinking for at least 2 hours. Subjects will be instructed to drink 4 ounces water and to refrain from additional eating and drinking until after they have completed the 1-hour scintigraphic acquisition. Study Personnel will prepare the assigned spray bottle containing the radiolabeled respiratory preparation for use in an appropriate manner and document in the batch record. In order to correct for radiation attenuation through the neck, Study Personnel will administer a single spray of the radiolabeled respiratory preparation into a plastic bag. Subjects will be positioned with their chest facing the detector of the gamma camera and their head in a left lateral position and in contact with the front of the detector. Study Personnel will hold the radioactive bag on the side of the subject's neck away from the detector and obtain a 1-minute static image. The subject will then be removed from the detector, the radioactive bag will be positioned at the same distance from the detector, and a second 1-minute static image will be obtained. Approximately 1 hour after drinking the 4 ounces of water, subjects will be administered 3 sprays of radiolabeled respiratory preparation to the back of the throat for a total volume of approximately 0.48 mL. Subjects will be instructed to not swallow for 60 seconds after the last spray. Study Personnel will notify subjects when swallowing can resume and record all swallows to the extent possible throughout the 1-hour scintigraphic acquisition. Within approximately 20 seconds of the last spray, the subject will be positioned with their chest facing the detector of the gamma camera and their head in a left lateral position, in contact with the front of the detector. Scintigraphic acquisition will start approximately 20 seconds after the last spray and will end 1 hour 20 seconds after the last spray. A dynamic image set consisting of sixty continuous 30-second frames will be acquired in the first 30 minutes. Note that the dynamic imaging may be interrupted for a short interval (less than 30 seconds) during the last 15 minutes of this 30 minute period in the event that subjects experience discomfort. Every attempt will be made to acquire a continuous 30 minute interval, and if any interruption in imaging occurs, these frames will be excluded from data analysis. Once the dynamic image set is complete, the subject will be removed from the detector and allowed to relax while sitting near the gamma camera. The subject will be repositioned in front of the detector to obtain a 30-second static image every 5 minutes for the next 30 minutes. External radioactive sources (fiducials) will be placed on the subject (e.g. at the mid brow line and on the chin or elsewhere as deemed appropriate by study personnel) in order to account for subject movement and repositioning during static imaging sequences. Another external radioactive source may be used to outline the head, neck and shoulder as they appear within the field of view of the gamma camera. The subject will remain as quiet and motionless as possible and with their head in contact with the detector throughout the 30-minute dynamic image set and throughout each 30-second static image. Restraint tape may be used as a reminder to the subject to remain motionless. At the end of the scintigraphic acquisition period, adverse device effects will be assessed, study closeout procedures will be completed and subjects will be compensated for their participation in the study Respiratory Preparation Groups Identity of Respiratory Preparation FIG. 10 is Table 10 and shows a description of the respiratory preparation. Preparation of Respiratory Preparation at the Site The Investigator will be responsible for the radiolabelling of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose with 99mTc, acquiring the aqueous 111In-DTPA, and assembly of the test articles. Preparation of the radiolabeled respiratory preparation and handling radiopharmaceuticals will follow Sponsor approved procedures documented in Sponsor approved batch records. The radionuclide used in this study is Technetium-99m (99mTc), in the form of 99mTc sodium-carboxymethyl cellulose (99mTc—NaCMC) and Indium DTPA (111In-DTPA)2. The radiolabeled sodium-carboxymethyl cellulose will be prepared following Sponsor approved procedures documented in Sponsor approved batch records. The radiolabeled sodium-carboxymethyl cellulose will be added to the respiratory preparation on each study day, in an appropriate volume. All respiratory preparations will be prepared within 12 hours of dosing, and confirmation of radiolabel and activity will be completed. Respiratory Preparation Administration The actuator will be properly primed prior to use and subject assignment to bottles will be documented in master batch records or source documents. Prior to and following administration of the respiratory preparation, the bottle will be weighed in order to determine the total weight delivered to the subject. All subjects will receive 1 administration of three target sprays without delay for a total of approximately 0.48 ml of radiolabeled respiratory preparation delivered to the back of the throat by Study Personnel. Subjects will be asked not swallow for at least 60 seconds after administration of the respiratory preparation. Radioactivity Exposure The respiratory preparation will be administered once to each subject, and this administration will contain radioactive markers. Effectiveness Observations and Measurements Scintigraphy Analysis The raw radiation counts for each combination of subject, pixel, and radionuclide (99mTc and 111In) will be archived on computer disk and/or optical disk after being aligned and having removed the external markers from the images using ScinCam data acquisition software and ScinWin data analysis software (GammaForge, Louisville, Ky.). Scintigraphic data analysis for each radionuclide will be performed on specialized Nuclear Mac software as follows: The sequential computer generated images will be reviewed for each subject and three regions of interest will be drawn to represent the oral cavity, oropharynx, and esophagus using Nuclear Mac software. All counts will be corrected for radioactivity decay, background, and attenuation of radiation through the neck. Elapsed time along with the radionuclide half life will be used to correct for radioactivity decay. For the background correction, an arbitrary region will be selected away from the throat on each image. The total number of radiation counts in this region will be divided by the total number of pixels, and this count per pixel will be subtracted from each pixel in each anatomical region of interest. The attenuation correction will be made using the 1-minute static images captured prior to administration of the respiratory preparation (one image with the subject in position at the detector and the radioactive bag positioned at the neck away from the camera and one image of the radioactive bag at the same distance without the subject). Fraction retention in each of the regions of interest will be calculated by summing the counts across all the regions in the first complete frame of data acquisition and dividing the count in each region of interest by this sum. Fraction retained versus time curves will be generated allowing area-under-curve (AUC) and rate constants to be computed for each radionuclide, 99mTc and 111In. Primary Endpoints Of primary interest will be area under the curve from 0 to 1 hour for percent of the respiratory preparation retained in the oropharynx, estimated via 99mTc—NaCMC counts and denoted AUC(0-1; oropharynx; 99mTc—NaCMC). Secondary Endpoints Of Secondary Interest Will be: Area under the curve from 0 to 1 hour for percent of the respiratory preparation retained in the oropharynx, estimated via 111In-DTPA counts and denoted AUC(0-1; oropharynx; 111In-DTPA) Area under the curve from 0 to 1 hour for percent of the respiratory preparation retained in the oral cavity, estimated via 99mTc—NaCMC counts and denoted AUC(0-1; oral cavity; 99mTc—NaCMC). Area under the curve from 0 to 1 hour for percent of the respiratory preparation retained in the oral cavity, estimated via 111In-DTPA counts and denoted AUC(0-1; oral cavity; 111In-DTPA) Area under the curve from 0 to 1 hour for percent of the respiratory preparation retained in the esophagus, estimated via 99mTc—NaCMC counts and denoted AUC(0-1; esophagus; 99mTc—NaCMC). Area under the curve from 0 to 1 hour for percent of the respiratory preparation retained. Efficacy Results and Tabulations of Individual Subject Data Analysis of Efficacy (Per-Protocol) As per protocol, the area under the retained fraction versus time curve from 0 to 1 hour was calculated for the PP population. The descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals for the mean of each scintigraphy parameter are provided in FIG. 11 which is Table 11 for Technetium-99m and FIG. 12 which is Table 12 for Indium DTPA. A graphical depiction of the area under the retained volume versus time curve from 0 to 1 hour by region of interest is provided in FIG. 13. The listing of mean area under the retained fraction versus time curve from 0 to 1 hour by subject is provided in FIG. 11. Primary Efficacy Endpoint Results The mean area under the retained fraction versus time curve from 0 to 1 hour for the total oropharynx was 6.01 minutes, with a 95% confidence interval of 3.91 to 8.10 minutes using 99mTc—NaCMC (FIG. 11). Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Results Total Oropharynx The mean area under the retained fraction versus time curve from 0 to 1 hour for the total oropharynx was 5.83 minutes, with a 95% confidence interval of 3.66 to 7.99 minutes using 111In-DTPA (FIG. 12). Oral Cavity The mean area under the retained fraction versus time curve from 0 to 1 hour for the oral cavity was 3.36 minutes (95% confidence interval [2.06, 4.67]) using 99mTc—NaCMC (FIG. 11) and 2.69 minutes (95% confidence interval [1.68, 3.70]) using 111In-DTPA (FIG. 12). Esophagus The mean area under the retained fraction versus time curve from 0 to 1 hour for the esophagus was 1.52 minutes (95% confidence interval [1.15, 1.89] using 99mTc—NaCMC (FIG. 11) and 1.41 minutes (95% confidence interval [1.05, 1.77]) using 111In-DTPA (FIG. 12). Additional Efficacy Endpoint Results An additional analysis of the mean area under the retained fraction versus time curve from 0 to 1 hour for the proximal oropharynx showed means of 1.83 minutes (95% confidence interval [1.22, 2.45]) for 99mTc—NaCMC (FIG. 11) and 1.63 minutes (95% confidence interval [1.09, 2.17]) using 111In-DTPA (FIG. 12. Analysis of Adhoc Efficacy Endpoints Retention volumes for the Technetium-99m data were calculated from the mass retained in each of the regions of interest: oral cavity, esophagus and total oropharynx. The area under the retained volume versus time curve from 0 to 1 hour was calculated for the PP population. A graphical depiction of the area under the retained volume versus time curve from 0 to 1 hour by region of interest is found in FIG. 13. Efficacy Conclusions There were no differences in the comparison of 99mTc—CMC vs 111In-DTPA retention in the regions of interest selected for observation: oral cavity (mouth), total oropharynx, or esophagus. The mean area under the retained fraction versus time curve from 0 to 1 hour was the shortest in the esophagus with a time of approximately 1.5 minutes, doubling to about 3.5 minutes in the oral cavity and nearly doubling again for the total oropharynx. Retained volumes ranged from about 0.75 mL×minutes in the esophagus, to about 1.7 mL×minutes in the oral cavity to 3 mL×minutes in the total oropharynx. Discussion and Overall Conclusions The results of this study suggest that the respiratory preparation was retained in the mouth, oropharynx and esophagus as measured by gamma scintigraphy using both 99mTc—NaCMC and 111In-DTPA methods. Coating in the mouth and on the tongue seen on the scintigraphic images and quantitative data is suspected to be largely due to the administration technique of spraying into the distal mouth. There were no differences in the comparison of 99mTc—CMC vs 111In-DTPA retained fraction AUCs in the regions of interest selected for observation: oral cavity (mouth), total oropharynx, or esophagus. When the additional anatomical region of proximal oropharynx was observed, there was some radioactive substance retention, but not as great as the total oropharynx even when the coating per unit area was computed. The number of pixels used for the final count evaluation determined the unit area. The formulation was influenced by gravity with a resulting drainage into and down the esophagus. Swallowing was monitored, but did not have any observable influence on the retention of the formulation in the oropharynx. There was no scintigraphic image evidence of any formulation entering the larynx or trachea for any of the 16 subjects. The image acquisition during the first 30 minutes allowed no movement of the subjects, but after the initial 30 minutes of image acquisition the subjects were permitted to move (not standing) away from the scintillation camera surface. In some subjects, there was an observed clearance that was enhanced compared to the previous 30-minute stationary acquisition. There were significant differences in the retained fraction AUC's for Tc-99m-CMC when comparing the oral cavity, total oropharynx and esophagus. There was definite coating with retention on the oropharynx surfaces with pooling above the epiglottis. The pooling observation enhanced the appearance of retained fraction of the formulation. Therefore pooling does involve coating the total oropharynx surface. EXAMPLES The following examples further describe and demonstrate embodiments within the scope of the present invention.
