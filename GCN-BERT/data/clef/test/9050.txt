Technical Field The invention relates to a rocking chair, and more particularly, to a foldable rocking chair which is able to be simply folded up or expanded. Background Art Foldable chairs having a foldable frame and a soft panel attached to the frame have long been developed. They are able to be folded for saving storage space. Rocking chairs also have a long history. A rocking chair often has a chair standing on a pair of arcuate rockers. However, there is not such a foldable rocking chair. It is desirable to have a foldable rocking chair which is able to be folded to save storage space and be easy to carry and transport. Technical Problem The object of the invention is to provide a foldable rocking chair which is able to be simply folded up or expanded for saving storage space or easy transportation. Technical Solution In order to accomplish the above object, the present invention provides a foldable rocking chair having a frame and a soft panel attached to the frame. The soft panel has a backrest portion and a seat portion. The frame has a pair of front legs each having a lower and an upper ends, a pair of rear legs each having a lower and an upper ends, a U-shaped seat tube having two arms each having a rear portion and an end respectively pivotally linked to a middle portion of each front legs, a U-shaped back tube having two arms each having an end respectively pivotally linked both to the upper ends of each rear legs and the rear portion of each arm of the U-shaped seat tube, a pair of connecting tubes each having a lower end and an upper end respectively pivotally linked each arm of the U-shaped back tube in a certain distance to the end of each arm of the U-shaped back tube, a pair of arm rests each having a front end and a rear end respectively pivotally linked to a middle portion of the arm of the back tube, a pair of rails attached to and extending along each arm rests and each having a guiding groove which has a front dent receiving a pin formed on each upper end of the front legs, a pair of rockers each having a front end respectively pivotally linked to the lower end of the front legs, a rear end to the lower end of the rear legs and a middle to the lower end of the connecting tubes, and a pair of stoppers firmly installed on the upper end of each rear legs. Advantageous Effects The foldable rocking chair is able to be simply folded up or expanded for saving storage space or easy transportation.

Fig. 5 is a perspective view of the foldable rocking chair shown in Fig. 2 showing a folded frame thereof. Fig. 6 is a perspective view of a frame of another embodiment of the foldable rocking chair of the invention. Fig. 7 is a partially enlarged view of the foldable rocking chair shown in Fig. 2. And, Fig. 8 is a perspective view of a frame of yet another embodiment of the foldable rocking chair of the invention. Best Mode Shown in Fig. 1 is the preferred embodiment of the foldable rocking chair of the invention. The foldable rocking chair has a frame 100 and a soft panel 200 securely attached to the frame 100. The soft panel 200 has a backrest portion 201 and a seat portion 202. Together with reference to Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 7, in which the soft panel 200 is removed for better illustration of the frame 100, the frame 100 has a pair of front legs 4 each having a lower and an upper ends, a pair of rear legs 6 each having a lower and an upper ends, a U-shaped seat tube 1 having two arms each having a rear portion and an end respectively pivotally linked to a middle portion of each front legs 4, a U-shaped back tube 3 having two arms each having an end respectively pivotally linked both to the upper ends of each rear legs 6 and the rear portion of each arm of the U-shaped seat tube 1, a pair of connecting tubes 7 each having a lower end and an upper end respectively pivotally linked each arm of the U-shaped back tube 3 in a certain distance to the end of each arm of the U-shaped back tube 3, a pair of arm rests 2 each having a front end and a rear end respectively pivotally linked to a middle portion of the arm of the back tube 3, a pair of rails 5 attached to and extending along each arm rests 2 and each having a guiding groove 51 which has a front dent 52 receiving a pin 41 formed on each upper end of the front legs 4, a pair of rockers 8 each having a front end respectively pivotally linked to the lower end of the front legs 4, a rear end to the lower end of the rear legs 6 and a middle to the lower end of the connecting tubes 7, and a pair of stoppers 10 firmly installed on the upper end of each rear legs 6 for abutting each connecting tubes 7. As shown in Fig. 2, at least one rocker reinforcement bar 9 and at least one leg reinforcement bar 11 may be provided respectively between the two rockers 8 and between the two front legs 4. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 6, a front rocker reinforcement bar is integrally formed with the front ends of each rocker 8. In the embodiment shown in Fig. 8, the pair of rails 5 is replaced with a pair of linking arms 5 respectively pivotally linking the upper end of each front legs 4 and a middle portion of each arm rests 2. In use, as shown in Fig. 4, a user is able to lift the front ends of the pair of arm rests 2 upward. First, the pins 41 on each upper end of the front legs 4 leave the front dent 52 of the guiding groove 51. And when the user keeps lifting, the pins 41 slide backward along in the guiding groove 51 and the foldable rocking chair of the invention is able to be folded up. A folded rocking chair is as shown in Fig. 5. 1. A foldable rocking chair comprising a frame and a soft panel attached to the frame, the soft panel having a backrest portion and a seat portion, the frame having a pair of front legs each having a lower and an upper ends, a pair of rear legs each having a lower and an upper ends, a U-shaped seat tube having two arms each having a rear portion and an end respectively pivotally linked to a middle portion of each front legs, a U-shaped back tube having two arms each having an end respectively pivotally linked both to the upper ends of each rear legs and the rear portion of each arm of the U-shaped seat tube, a pair of connecting tubes each having a lower end and an upper end respectively pivotally linked each arm of the U-shaped back tube in a certain distance to the end of each arm of the U-shaped back tube, a pair of arm rests each having a front end and a rear end respectively pivotally linked to a middle portion of the arm of the back tube, a pair of rails attached to and extending along each arm rests and each having a guiding groove which has a front dent receiving a pin formed on each upper end of the front legs, a pair of rockers each having a front end respectively pivotally linked to the lower end of the front legs, a rear end to the lower end of the rear legs and a middle to the lower end of the connecting tubes, and a pair of stoppers firmly installed on the upper end of each rear legs. 2.
