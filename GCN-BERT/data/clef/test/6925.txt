Example 1
Synthesis of Compound (1) (i.e., T12; 2,3-bis(lauroyl) tartaric acid)
Following established methods (Faig, et al., Biomacromolecules 2014, 15, (9), 3328-37), tartaric acid ((151) 4.05 g, 27 mmol) was acylated at the vicinal hydroxyl groups by refluxing neat in lauroyl chloride (45.9 mL, 119 mmol) with zinc chloride (ZnCl2, 1.15 g, 8 mmol) as a catalyst to provide compound (1), as confirmed by the presence of laurate ester peaks in 1H NMR and ester appearance in 13C NMR and FTIR. Yield: 11.57 g, 89% (white solid).
