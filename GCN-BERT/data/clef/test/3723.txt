The second step
To a solution of Compound 57 (11.0mg, 0.022mmol) in DMF (1 mL) were added a large excess of 60% sodium hydride and 1,2-dibromoethane under ice-cooling, and the mixture was stirred for 14 hours at room temperature. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate after addition of a saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (ethyl acetate) to yield Compound I-85 (1.7mg, yield 15%).
