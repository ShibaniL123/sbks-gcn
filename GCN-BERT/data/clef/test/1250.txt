/v I TO- ALL V.HOM IT VAY COITOKKJT: , Be It knov.ii that I, PATRICK JOSEPH VWER, Of the City, County ' and State of New York, gentleman, having invonted certain new and useful j Inrorovomenta in Safety Razor Stropping Devices, d'o.hereby declare thai --i ' the following is a fiill, clear and exact desoription of the same. This invention relates to cutlery and particularly i that used in the tonaorial art, and consists of a means for j sharpening razor blades of the kind used in the type of i razor known to the trade as safety razors, and more particu¬ larly the invention relates to iraproved means for supporting ; ': the hlade hetweon clamping members supported by a handle j member and guard. ! The object of the invention is to provide a highly | satisfactory means by which to support the blade of any ordinary safoty razors such as are now in general use and on ! the market for sharpening, with the same degree of facility and convenience that the ordinary razor may be sharpened upon a stone or razor strop, an operation which under the present state of the art is not possible. More specifically, a further object of the invention is to proviâe a means wherer by any ordinary safety razor blade may be quickly and firm¬ ly clamped and secured in tbo holder, and easily removed therefrom when sharpened, and a further object is to provide ! i a guard to protect the person using the device from injury | from the razor blade when it is being sbarpened, so that when one edge of a duplex blade is being sharpened the opposite : edge will be within a suitable guard member so that a person cannot be harmed thereby, neither can the edge of the blade be injured by any means during the process of sharpening. A further object of the invention is to provide a I guard for the razor blade of the character described which ; will admit of reversing the razor daring the process of ,i ji sharpening- from side to side in the same manner that an h ordinary razor is reversed by turning the razor in a re- ' versed position while the back of the blade is held against ji -1- ' /"' 7 glOSSÎ a stono or razor strop, thus preventing any injury to tto edge of the blade Which is to be sharpened. f A further object is to provide such a guard member for the razor blade which may be readily reversed while the razor blade is clamped in the holder, so that either edge of the blade may be sharpened and with equal facility on both sides thereof, without removing the blade from the clamping means before-tbe sharpening process is satisfactorily cora- plsted, and a further object is to provide a holder for duplex razor blades of the character described that admits of sharpening the same vrf-th equal facility upon an ordinary hone or stone or an ordinary razor strop. With these objects in view reference may be had to the accompanying drawings, in which similar reference characters relate to similar parts in the several views thereof, and in which Figure 1 is a sectional plan of my holder showing a duplex razor blade clamped therein in the manner contemplated for sharpening one edge of a duplex razor blade. Figure B is a/sectional edge view or side view of the clamping means showing the duplex razor blade held therein with the guard disposed in a position intermediate between the position in which it is held, when either edge of the duplex blade is be- ifcg sharpened. Figure 3 is a sectional view through the line 3 — 3 of Figure 1, illustrating the manner in which the blade is reversed during the sharpening process for sharpen¬ ing the opposite sides of one edge of the duplex razor blade :i by rolling the holding means in a semi-circular direction around the back thereof or around the guard member of the do- I i vice, and indicating the position of the blade in solid lines I .•upon a stone and the reversed position in dotted lines in tbe i il -s- I relation whi oh the parts are disposed ' when the holder and razor blade is so reversed. figure 4 is an enlarged detail view in perspective showing the clamping members and the means for retaining the clamps in closed relation. In the drawings the numeral 10 indicates the handle of the holder which may be made in any desired form or de¬ sign. One end thereof is reduced and rounded by turning to a desired diameter. It is then bored and interiorly thread- i ed as at 12. A shoulder 13 is provided as a stop for con¬ tacting parts of the device. A flanged seat 14 with the . exteriorly threaded portion 15 is disposed around the re¬ duced member 12, and a helical spring 16 disposed therein, the guard member 17 having the flanged bearing portion 18, and is interiorly threaded so as to engage the threaded j portion 15 of the flanged seat member 14. This bearing mem- I ber 18 of the guard 17 is provided vrith the interiorly dis- j posed annular flange 19, and an annular extension extending in a direction oppositely from the interiorly threaded por- ! tion as SO. When the flanged seat member 14 is threaded into the threaded portion 18 of the guard member 17, the helical spring 16 is disposed therein. A clamping means is ! : now disposed in assembled relation by inserting the threadedj extension SI of the base member 22 of the interiorly threadedl portion or neck of the handle 11, and the shoulder 23 of the baseplate 22 will then form a seat or bearing for the helical 'I spring 16 and the interior annular flange 19 will closely ; surround the shoulder 23 and is movable longitudinally there- t on to a limited distance, and is rotatable therearound. er A second should 24 is formed on the baseplate 22 and engages interiorly within the annular extension 20 of the :! -3- guard 17 in such a manner that a space is provided as at "between the interior annular flange 19 and the said shoulder 24, so that by moving the guard member longitudinally the helical spring 16 is thereby ôompressed between the flange of member 14 and the shoulder 23 x1 the baseplate 22. The shoulder 24 of the baseplate 22 serves as a stop to limit the longitudinal movement of the guard. On the opposite end of the baseplate 22 is a pivot or bearing member 26, which is rotatabl© in the bearing end 27 of tte guard member 17-a of the guard 17. ITormally the guard is held against rotation or turning in either direction upon the bearing 27 and around , the shoulder portions 23 and 24 of the baseplate 22. Chis is i accomplished by lugs 28 provided on the pivot or bearing 26 extending laterally therefrom in a plane parallel with the baseplate. These lugs are disposed in recesses 29 in the guard member 17-a of the guard 17, which extend laterally - ', from the recess which receives the bearing or pivot 26 of j the baseplate 22. The guard member 17-a has a knurled nib : 17-b adapted to be grasped with the fingers of a persons ! ;, hand when it is desired to adjust the guard. This adjust- J : ment is made by holding the handle of the device in one hand 'i and grasping tbs said knurled nib by the fingers of the other :; hand and exerting a movement upon the guard longitudinally ii il of the holding means, thus depressing the helical spring 16 :i ; in the manner hereinbefore described, and this movement / serves to release the guard member 17-a from engagement with |; the lugs 28 which engage the recesses 29 of the guard member ii ii 17-a and which permit the movement of the guard in a oircu- |j lar plane around the blade. Fhis, as i a quite obvious will make itpcs. sible to reverse the position of the guard from one 31 da of the clamping menibers to -pho opposite side of the clamping ineinbers as required to protect either edge of a duplex razor "blade vfaile the opposite edge thereof ig being sharpened. It is not ordinarily nedessary to move the gta rd in an arc of more than 180 degrees of a circle, or an arc equal to a semi-circle , "but the construction herein described makes it possible to move the guard in a rabada circularly around the clamping members and the blade which may be held . therein, but the gua.rd is not designed to be held in a .fixed position except at the two positions on a diametrical line passing through the center of the clamping means and the ; blade when a blade is held tierein, so that a line passing ! i ;•: through the center of the blade 30 is indicated in Figure 3 I i where the broken line A--A will glways pass through the center of the guard member 17. This will insure an equal j distribution of the grinding or sharpening process upon the i opposite sides of either edge of a duplex razor blade, eitherj j edge of which is to be sharpened or is being sharpened. j j To provide for assembling the device the guard m ember ! j is made of tho two members 17 and 17-a, and joined together jby threaded screws as 17-c, so that the guard member 17 may * be disposed in position for engagement with the handle mem- 821(3 ber :ojB: the helical spring as above described, and the member i ij 17-a may then be disposed over the pivot or bearing £6 with if •the lugs 28, and then secured in position by the threaded ); screws 17-o.Toeing thus assembled, sfabcy to all intents and ;i it • ; purposes/operates as though it were constructed integrally ;' in one piece only. i The clamping means will now be described. The base- ;! -5- ':W\ plate 22 of the clamping means has the threaded extension 21 of the shoulder parts 23 and 24 thereon, and integrally formed therewith. The clamping member 22 is adapted to sup¬ port the champing member 31 by hinged connection having luga thereon 22-a to engage the lugs êl-a of the clamping member 31, through which the pin 32 is disposed on which the clamp¬ ing member 31 may swing as required to open and close the clamping members to admit or remove the razor blade 30. For securing the razor blade in the proper relation be¬ tween the clamping members I provide mating parts or nibs 22-b and 31-b, for engaging apertures through the razor blade 30. Attention will be called to the manner of forming these nibs or retaining members, inasmuch as they are an important | ..feature of this invention. The clamping members 22 and 31 may be made of sheet matai of desired quality and gauge. An : incision is made therethrough in the form of a semi-circle where it is desired to form a nib for retaining the razor blade. On the base member 22 the semi-circular incision or cut therethrough would be described perhaps on the right of ; the centorline while in the upper member 31 the semi-circular incision or cut rould be described to the left of the center- [ member .line of the toarauio. V/hen the clamping members 22 and 31 are in assembled relation, then the se mi-circular incisions i i therethrough for the ftrmation of the nibs or retaining mem- ' bers 22-b and 31-b, as will be seen, would be oppositely j i disposed to the right and to the left of said center line, ! or vice versa. To form these nibs or retaining members after i : the semi-circular cut or incision is made through the blade, ;! i i .; or simultaneously with the making of such cut or incision, j the lip or semi-circular portion thus freed from the body i ii -6- portion of the member is turned, upwardly or dcxvnwardly under : pressure, for which operation a suitahle forming tool is em- ; ployed, so as to form a rounded nib. The two nihs 2E-b on the lomor plate or clamping member 22 are disposed upwardly j and present a plain surfaoe on the longitudinal center line and at a right angle with the upper surface of tte clamping member 22, while the nibs or retaining members Sl-b on the upper clamping member 31 are disposed downwardly, pre¬ senting a plain surface on the longitudinal center line of the clamping member and at a right angle with the lower sur- \ face of the clamping member 31, so as to be opposed to the plain surface of the nibs 22-b of the clamping member 22. By this arrangement the nibs 22-b are disposed in the ! spaces or apertures provided by the method described in form-l i ing the nibs 31-b of the upper clamping member 31, and the j nibs 31-b of tte upper clamping member 31 are adapted to be j disposed in the apertures provided in the lovrer clamping j member 22 by the method described in forming the nibs 22-b | of ' awd the clamping member 22, so that when the clamping members : are in closed position the nibs 22-b of the lower clamping member and the nibs 31-b of the upper clamping member are disposed through the apertures of the razor blade 30 in the .: manner illustrated in Figure 3 as indicated by the numerals 22-b and 31-b shown in mating relation in Figure 3. Thus I have provided a very perfect but inexpensive : manner of constructing nibs or retaining means for retaining j the razor blade in the proper relation between the clamping j members of this device, and for preventing the razor blade j from shifting in a longitudinal or lateral direction. To firmly grip or clamp the razor blade between the ! 1 . -v- i •( i olarapinc raom'bera 22 and 31 I have provided a means for se¬ curing the upper clamping member 31 firmly in closed pes ition for gripping the razor "blade. Ms means is described as follows: ! i Recesses 34 are provided in the portion of the clamping; member 23 adjacent the guard member 17-a and the bearing 86. j l These recesses 34 are adapted to admit mating members 35, j o g j "fcani&ng: extensions or lugs formed on the free endof the j i clamping member 31 so that when the said clamp member 31 is J brought in opposed relation to the clamping member £2 these j extensions 35 fit closely within the recesses 34 and prevent j is any lateral movement thereof. The rocessos 36 are provided in the end portion of tbe clamping member 22 adjacent the recesses 34 and extending laterally through the said end portion, being substantially in the form of an "i", but disposed in horizontal relation, with the base thereof being directed otanBiro-ced: downwardly instead of horizontally. A locking member 37 being substantially in the form of the '"-shaped member , . , , recBsir, fits closely within said recess and extends sub- ! stantially the entire distance through the end portion of -, the clamping member 22. This lo dcing member 37 is sbown j! in its normal position in Figure 1, and when in this position j it engages the extensions 35 of the clamping member 31 upon j j: the upper surfaces thereof as shown in Figure 2, thus pre- j ii venting the extension 35 from being raised from the recesses j ; 34, so as to release the razor blade from between the clamp¬ ing members. V/hen it is desired to release the razor blade i: from the clamping members the locking member 37 is with- l drawn by means of a small nib 37-a,by which the locking mem- ' ber 37 is moved a sufficient distance laterally with re- y lation to the clamping member 22, so that the portioisof the locking raeiaber which engaged the ejctension 35 of the clamping j member 31 are disengaged therefrom, and reoesaes 37-b in¬ dicated in Figures 1 and 4 coincide with the recesses 54 of the end portion of the plate 22, thus freeing tte extension from engagement •with the locking member 37 and permitting ! the clamping member 31 to be lifted from its closed position I so that the razor blade may be removed from the clamping mem¬ bers. ITo limit the movement of the locking member 37 lat- j erally with relation to the clamping member 22 I provide a i slot 38 in the upper surface of the end per tion of tbe clamp- ing member 2S connecting with the recess 36. A pin 39 is ] disposed in the locking member 37 in such a manner that its ! j upper portion is flush with the upper surface of the end por- ; tion of the clamping plate 22. îhis limits the thrust of tte ; i locking member 37. The base portion of the "I/'-shaped recess ! 36 and looking member 37 as 36-a, serves to retain the locking! member in its seat in said recess, and in its proper relation j to the clamping member 22 longitudinally thereof. Y/hen a razor blade is to be inserted for sharpening it is disposed j upon the lov/er clamping member 22 with the nibs 22-b upwardly j disposed therethrough tbe apertures thereof and the clamping member is then brought to bear downwardly against tTe upper surface of the razor blade,and the nibs 31-b are disposed through the apertures in opposition to the nibs 22-b of the mating surfaces of the opposing nibs and the roimded or in¬ clined outer surfaces thereof tend to forcibly engage the peripheral inner surface of the apertures of the razor blade, firmly gripping the blade so that it cannot move either lat- i; ;erally or longitudinally between the clamping members. The !. -9- N» exterBions 35 of tte clamping member 31 are disposed in the recesses 34 of the end portion of the clamping member £2. ; Pressure is oxortecL upon the extonOad enl of the locking mom- j her 37 or the nib 37-a and the locking member 37 is forced into its normal position so as to engage and retain the extensions of the clamping member 31. Tlie razor blade is now firmly clasped and held rigidly between the opposed clamping members ready for sharpening. The guard 17 is now disposed as shavn in Figure 1 and Figure j 3, so that a center lino pissing through the blade gripped j between the clamping members will pass through the guard mem- _ ber 17 at the conter thereof, and the blade is now properly j disposed in the clamping members and the holding means for j sharpening. As will be seen from Figure 3, this arrangement j makes it possible to sharpen the razor blade and give the j * blade j proper bevel to the edge without injury to the Swotaix of an j /equal degree of angle on both sides thereof, and by reversing. the guard member in the manner described the opposite edge j ; of the razor blade may also be sharpened and given the proper j !'angle of bevel in like manner. j While I havo described my invention specifically as j :• i ! shown in the accompanying drawings, I do no t wish to be uncter !; stood to limit my invention to the form of device herein j ;! shown and described, but reserve the right to depart there- :! from within the reasonable scope and spirit of this in- : vention. \H l- ,10557 'i Having thus da s cri bed my invention, what I claim as :i <new and desire to secure "by Letters Patent &#-t"he-Uai-ted 'i ;j 1.
