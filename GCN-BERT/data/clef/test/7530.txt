(2S,3S,4S,5S)-3-tert-butyl-4-({[2-methoxy-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methyl}amino)-1-{[(propan-2-yl)oxy]carbonyl}-5-{2-[(propan-2-yl)oxy]pyridin-3-yl}pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid
Example 78A
(2S,3R,4S,5S)-2-ethyl 1-isopropyl 3-(tert-butyl)-5-(2-isopropoxypyridin-3-yl)-4-nitropyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxylate
To (2S,3R,4S,5S)-ethyl 3-(tert-butyl)-5-(2-isopropoxypyridin-3-yl)-4-nitropyrrolidine-2-carboxylate (Core 13, 2.00 g, 5.27 mmol) and triethylamine (5.88 mL, 42.2 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL) was added isopropyl carbonochloridate (3.88 g, 31.6 mmol) dropwise at ambient temperature. The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature overnight, and dichloromethane (20 mL) and water (10 mL) were added. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification via chromatography on an 80 g silica gel cartridge, eluting with ethyl acetate in heptane at 0-40% gradient provided the title compound 2.26 g (92% yield).
