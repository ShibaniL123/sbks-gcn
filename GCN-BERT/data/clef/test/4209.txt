N-PHENYL-CARBOXAMIDE DERIVATIVES AND THE USE THEREOF AS MEDICAMENTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF HEPATITIS Β Background Art The Hepatitis Β virus (HBV) is an enveloped, partially double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus of the Hepadnavirus family (Hepadnaviridae). Its genome contains 4 overlapping reading frames: the precore/core gene; the polymerase gene; the L, Μ, and S genes, which encode for the 3 envelope proteins; and the X gene. Upon infection, the partially double-stranded DNA genome (the relaxed circular DNA; rcDNA) is converted to a covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) in the nucleus of the host cell and the viral mRNAs are transcribed. Once encapsidated, the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), which also codes for core protein and Pol, serves as the template for reverse transcription, which regenerates the partially dsDNA genome (rcDNA) in the nucleocapsid. HBV has caused epidemics in parts of Asia and Africa, and it is endemic in China. HBV has infected approximately 2 billion people worldwide of which approximately 350 million people have developed chronic infections. The virus causes the disease hepatitis Β and chronic infection is correlated with a strongly increased risk for the development cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Transmission of hepatitis Β virus results from exposure to infectious blood or body fluids, while viral DNA has been detected in the saliva, tears, and urine of chronic carriers with high titer DNA in serum. An effective and well-tolerated vaccine exists, but direct treatment options are currently limited to interferon and the following antivirals; tenofovir, lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir and telbivudine. In addition, heteroaryldihydropyrimidines (HAPs) were identified as a class of HBV inhibitors in tissue culture and animal models (Weber et al., Antiviral Res. 54: 69-78). WO/2013/006394, published on January 10 2013, relates to a subclass of Sulphamoylarylamides active against HBV. Amongst the problems which HBV direct antivirals may encounter are toxicity, mutagenicity, lack of selectivity, poor efficacy, poor bioavailability, and difficulty of synthesis. There is a need for additional HBV inhibitors that may overcome at least one of these disadvantages or that have additional advantages such as increased potency or an increased safety window.

Definitions The term "Ci_3alkyl" as a group or part of a group refers to a hydrocarbyl radical of Formula CnH2n+i wherein η is a number ranging from 1 to 3. In case Ci_3alkyl is coupled to a further radical, it refers to a Formula CnH2n. Ci_3alkyl groups comprise from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 2 carbon atoms. Ci_3alkyl includes all linear, or branched alkyl groups with between 1 and 3 carbon atoms, and thus includes such as for example methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, and /-propyl. Ci_4alkyl as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as the group defined for Ci_3 alkyl and butyl and the like. Ci_6alkyl as a group or part of a group defines straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon radicals having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms such as the groups defined for Ci_4alkyl and pentyl, hexyl, 2-methylbutyl and the like. The term “Ci_3alkyloxy” as a group or part of a group refers to a radical having the Formula ORc wherein Rc is Ci_3alkyl. Non-limiting examples of suitable Ci_3alkyloxy include methyloxy (also methoxy), ethyloxy (also ethoxy), propyloxy and isopropyloxy. The term οχο, C(=0), or carbonyl refers to a group composed of a carbon atom double bonded to an oxygen atom. As used herein, the term “3-7 membered saturated ring” means saturated cyclic hydrocarbon with 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 carbon atoms and is generic to cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and cycloheptyl. Such saturated ring optionally contains one or more heteroatoms, such that at least one carbon atom is replaced by a heteroatom selected from Ν, O and S, in particular from Ν and O. Examples include oxetane, tetrahydro-2H-pyranyl, piperidinyl, tetrahydrofuranyl, morpholinyl, thiolane 1,1-dioxide and pyrrolidinyl. Preferred are saturated cyclic hydrocarbon with 3 or 4 carbon atoms and 1 oxygen atom. Examples include oxetane, and tetrahydrofuranyl. It should be noted that different isomers of the various heterocycles may exist within the definitions as used throughout the specification. For example, pyrrolyl may be lH-pyrrolyl or 2H-pyrrolyl. The term halo and halogen are generic to fluoro, chloro, bromo or iodo. Preferred halogens are fluoro and chloro. It should also be noted that the radical positions on any molecular moiety used in the definitions may be anywhere on such moiety as long as it is chemically stable. For instance pyridyl includes 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl and 4-pyridyl; pentyl includes 1-pentyl, 2-pentyl and 3-pentyl. Positions indicated on phenyl (e.g. ortho, meta and/or para) are indicated relative to the bond connecting the phenyl to the main structure. An example with regard to the position of R1, any location is indicated relative to the nitrogen (*) connected to the main structure: (l) When any variable (e.g. halogen or Ci_4alkyl) occurs more than one time in any constituent, each definition is independent. For therapeutic use, the salts of the compounds of formula (I) are those wherein the counter ion is pharmaceutically or physiologically acceptable. However, salts having a pharmaceutically unacceptable counter ion may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound of formula (I). All salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not are included within the ambit of the present invention. The pharmaceutically acceptable or physiologically tolerable addition salt forms which the compounds of the present invention are able to form can conveniently be prepared using the appropriate acids, such as, for example, inorganic acids such as hydrohalic acids, e.g. hydrochloric or hydrobromic acid; sulfuric; hemisulphuric, nitric; phosphoric and the like acids; or organic acids such as, for example, acetic, aspartic, dodecylsulphuric, heptanoic, hexanoic, nicotinic, propanoic, hydroxyacetic, lactic, pyruvic, oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, /;-tolucncsulfonic, cyclamic, salicylic, /^-aminosalicylic, pamoic and the like acids. Conversely said acid addition salt forms can be converted by treatment with an appropriate base into the free base form. The term “salts” also comprises the hydrates and the solvent addition forms that the compounds of the present invention are able to form. Examples of such forms are e.g. hydrates, alcoholates and the like. The present compounds may also exist in their tautomeric forms For example, tautomeric forms of amide (-C(=0)-NH-) groups are iminoalcohols (-C(OH)=N-). Tautomeric forms, although not explicitly indicated in the structural formulae represented herein, are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. The term stereochemically isomeric forms of compounds of the present invention, as used hereinbefore, defines all possible compounds made up of the same atoms bonded by the same sequence of bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which are not interchangeable, which the compounds of the present invention may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of a compound encompasses the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms which said compound may possess. Said mixture may contain all diastereomers and/or enantiomers of the basic molecular structure of said compound. All stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of the present invention both in pure form or in admixture with each other are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention. Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates as mentioned herein are defined as isomers substantially free of other enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of the same basic molecular structure of said compounds or intermediates. In particular, the term 'stereoisomerically pure' concerns compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of at least 80% (i. ℮. minimum 90% of one isomer and maximum 10% of the other possible isomers) up to a stereoisomeric excess of 100% (i.e. 100% of one isomer and none of the other), more in particular, compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of 90% up to 100%, even more in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 94% up to 100% and most in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 97% up to 100%. The terms 'enantiomerically pure' and 'diastereomerically pure' should be understood in a similar way, but then having regard to the enantiomeric excess, respectively the diastereomeric excess of the mixture in question. Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates of this invention may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For instance, enantiomers may be separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with optically active acids or bases. Examples thereof are tartaric acid, dibenzoyltartaric acid, ditoluoyltartaric acid and camphosulfonic acid. Alternatively, enantiomers may be separated by chromatographic techniques using chiral stationary phases. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably, if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials. The diastereomeric forms of formula (I) can be obtained separately by conventional methods. Appropriate physical separation methods that may advantageously be employed are, for example, selective crystallization and chromatography, e.g. column chromatography. The present invention is also intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring on the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium. Isotopes of carbon include C-13 and C-14.

In a further aspect, the present invention concerns a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I) as specified herein, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A prophylactically effective amount in this context is an amount sufficient to prevent HBV infection in subjects being at risk of being infected. A therapeutically effective amount in this context is an amount sufficient to stabilize HBV infection, to reduce HBV infection, or to eradicate HBV infection, in infected subjects. In still a further aspect, this invention relates to a process of preparing a pharmaceutical composition as specified herein, which comprises intimately mixing a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier with a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I), as specified herein. Therefore, the compounds of the present invention or any subgroup thereof may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, particularly, for administration orally, rectally, percutaneously, or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules, and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms, in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations. In the compositions suitable for percutaneous administration, the carrier optionally comprises a penetration enhancing agent and/or a suitable wetting agent, optionally combined with suitable additives of any nature in minor proportions, which additives do not introduce a significant deleterious effect on the skin. The compounds of the present invention may also be administered via oral inhalation or insufflation in the form of a solution, a suspension or a dry powder using any art-known delivery system. It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, suppositories, powder packets, wafers, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof. The compounds of Formula (I) are active as inhibitors of the HBV replication cycle and can be used in the treatment and prophylaxis of HBV infection or diseases associated with HBV. The latter include progressive liver fibrosis, inflammation and necrosis leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Due to their antiviral properties, particularly their anti-HBV properties, the compounds of Formula (I) or any subgroup thereof, are useful in the inhibition of the HBV replication cycle, in particular in the treatment of warm-blooded animals, in particular humans, infected with HBV, and for the prophylaxis of HBV infections. The present invention furthermore relates to a method of treating a warm-blooded animal, in particular human, infected by HBV, or being at risk of infection by HBV, said method comprising the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula (I). The compounds of Formula (I), as specified herein, may therefore be used as a medicine, in particular as medicine to treat or prevent HBV infection. Said use as a medicine or method of treatment comprises the systemic administration to HBV infected subjects or to subjects susceptible to HBV infection of an amount effective to combat the conditions associated with HBV infection or an amount effective to prevent HBV infection. The present invention also relates to the use of the present compounds in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or the prevention of HBV infection. In general it is contemplated that an antiviral effective daily amount would be from about 0.01 to about 50 mg/kg, or about 0.01 to about 30 mg/kg body weight. It may be appropriate to administer the required dose as two, three, four or more sub-doses at appropriate intervals throughout the day. Said sub-doses may be formulated as unit dosage forms, for example, containing about 1 to about 500 mg, or about 1 to about 300 mg, or about 1 to about 100 mg, or about 2 to about 50 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form. The present invention also concerns combinations of a compound of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof, as specified herein with other anti-HBV agents. The term “combination” may relate to a product or kit containing (a) a compound of Formula (I), as specified above, and (b) at least one other compound capable of treating HBV infection (herein designated as anti-HBV agent), as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use in treatment of HBV infections.

In a particular embodiment, the invention concerns combination of a compound of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof with at least two anti-HBV agents. In a particular embodiment, the invention concerns combination of a compound of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof with at least three anti-HBV agents. In a particular embodiment, the invention concerns combination of a compound of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof with at least four anti-HBV agents. The combination of previously known anti-HBV agents, such as interferon-a (IFN-a), pegylated interferon-a, 3TC, adefovir or a combination thereof, and, a compound of formula (I) or any subgroup thereof can be used as a medicine in a combination therapy.

Biological examples - anti-HBV activity of compounds of Formula (I) The anti-HBV activity was measured using a stable transfected cell line, HepG2.2.15. This cell line was described to secrete relatively consistent high levels of HBV virion particles, which have been shown to cause both acute and chronic infection and disease in chimpanzees. For the antiviral, assay cells were treated twice for three days with serially diluted compound in 96-well plates in duplicate. After 6 days of treatment the antiviral activity was determined by quantification of purified HBV DNA from secreted virions using realtime PCR and an HBV specific primer set and probe. The anti HBV activity was also measured using the HepG2.117 cell line, a stable, inducibly HBV producing cell line, which replicates HBV in the absence of doxicycline (Tet-off system). For the antiviral assay, HBV replication was induced, followed by a treatment with serially diluted compound in 96-well plates in duplicate. After 3 days of treatment, the antiviral activity was determined by quantification of intracellular HBV DNA using realtime PCR and an HBV specific primer set and probe. Cytotoxicity of the compounds was tested using HepG2 cells, incubated for 4 days in the presence of compounds. The viability of the cells was assessed using a Resazurin assay.
