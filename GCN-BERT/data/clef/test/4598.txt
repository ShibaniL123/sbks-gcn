PROCESS FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE RECOVERY OF METAL COBALT, RUTHENIUM AND ALUMINUM FROM WASTE CATALYST C0-RU/AL203 IN FISCHER-TROPSCH SYNTHESIS FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] This invention relates to techniques of recovering metals from catalysts and waste catalysts, more particularly, to a method for recovering metal cobalt, ruthenium, and aluminum from waste Co-Ru/Al203catalysts for Flscher-Tropsch synthesis. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] To solve the problems of approaching oil depletion and increased environmental pollution, development of clean, renewable alternative liquid fuels becomes an essential topic. Flscher-Tropsch synthesis converts synthesis gas prepared from gasification of carbon-containing substances such as natural gas, coal, and biomassinto liquid fuel (as called synthetic oil) with the aid of Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. This synthetic oil is a clean, renewable fuel that can be converted into widely used gasoline or dieselthat meet the Euro 5 standard by consequent treatment such as distillation. [0003] The main metal active components of Fischer-Tropsch catalysts include the metal elements of Group VIII,such as Fe, Co, Ni, and Ru. In particular, the cobalt-based catalyst is a hot topics in research and application of Fischer-Tropsch catalysts due to its outstanding catalytic ability. Though Ru has the highest catalytic activity, its application is limited by its scarcity and high price and is usually used as a promoter to improve the selectivity and activity of a catalyst. There are many patentson Fischer-Tropsch catalysts using cobalt as the main active componentand ruthenium as the promoter, e.g., US Pat. No. 4,822,824, CN Pat. No. 1617292Α, and CN Pat. No. 101698152Α. [0004] Aluminum oxide has a high melting point, excellent thermal stability, and good wear resistance. It is widely used as a carrier for Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. Specially, the weight percentage amount of aluminum oxide in the Fischer-Tropsch catalysts used in slurry bed is more than 50%. Flowever, up to now, there is still no report on recovering aluminum oxide from Fischer-Tropsch catalysts. [0005] The reserves of cobalt and ruthenium in China are scare and mostly rely on expensive imports. This causes increased costs of the catalysts. Though China has a large reserve of bauxite, the increasing consumption of aluminum leads to a deficiency of the aluminum production capacity. Therefore, recovery of cobalt, ruthenium, and aluminum from deactivated Fischer-Tropsch catalysts and recycling them into metal salts or oxides that can be used in preparation of catalystsis a method to reduce environmental pollution as well as production cost of the catalyst. [0006] The prior patents on recovery of cobalt from cobalt-based catalysts carried on aluminum oxide includes CN Pat. No. 101270420 and CN Pat.No. 101700913Α.In CN Pat. No. 101270420Α, first, CO is introduced into a reactor containing deionized water and waste Fischer-Tropsch catalysts containing cobalt (including waste cobalt-based catalyst containing Si02, Al203, Zr02, or Ti02 as carriers) and heated at a constant temperature. Next, the reactor is cooled down and the CO is released therefrom. After that, the solution containing cobalt is released from the reactor and a lye is added into the solution to precipitate the cobalt as Co(OFI)2. Nitric acid is added into the precipitation to dissolve it. After crystallization by evaporation, Co(NC>3)2-6H20 is obtained. The Co(N03)2‘6H2Q obtained by this method has a purity lower than 99% and cannot be directly used in preparation of cobalt-based catalyst. In CN Pat. No. 101700913Α, waste cobalt-based catalyst on aluminum oxide carrier is ground, dissolved in concentrated hydrochloric acid, precipitated by sodium sulfide, precipitated by oxalic acid, calcined, dissolved in nitric acid, and crystallized by evaporationso as to obtain Co(N03)2'BH20 having a purity higher than 99%. However, because the waste catalysts are not reduced and because the intermediate CoSin the recovery process has very tiny particle sizes, loss of cobalt is likely to happen during filtration, which leads to a low cobalt recovery rate around 92%. [0007] Among the known methods for recovering ruthenium from waste catalysts, the most widely used one is distillation. For example, CN Pat. No. 100387344C recites analkali fusion-oxidization distillation method for recovery of ruthenium-based catalysts on activated carbon carrier. In this method, the ruthenium-based catalyst is calcined at 600 - 1000°C to remove the activated carbon carrier, and then is mixed with ΚΟΗ and KN03 and heated at 300 - 900°C for 1 - 5 hours to carry out analkali fusion reaction. After cooling, analkali fusion product is obtained. The alkali fusion product is dissolved in hot water of 50 90°C to obtain a K2RuC>4 solution. Then, sodium hypochlorite and concentrated sulfuric acid is added into the solution and distilled at 50 - 90°C for 2 - 4 hours to produce Ru04 gas. The Ru04 gas is absorbed witha strong acid solution and then distilled under atmospheric pressure or a reduced pressure to obtain a corresponding ruthenium salt. This method has disadvantages summarized as follows: Ru04 produced in distillation process is a strong oxidizer. Since it explodes when meeting organic molecules of light molecular weight and is highly toxic, the reactions must be performed in a closed fume hood. Furthermore, the procedure of this method is complex and long. In CN Pat. No. 102108444, a method for recovering ruthenium from ruthenium-based catalysts on carriers is recited. In this method, the catalyst is calcined at a high temperature under nitrogen for removal of organic substances and activation of the catalyst. Then the melted black catalyst solid is oxidized into RuC>4 gas at 100 - 300°C and 1 - 3 MPa under 02/03. The Ru04 gas is introduced into dilute hydrochloric acid and reduced to red-brown RuCI3 solution. p-RuCI3-xH20 is obtained after vacuum distillation of the RuCI3 solution. This method has a disadvantage of low ruthenium recovery rate. [0008] CN Pat. No. 101331240 recites a method for recovering ruthenium from used catalysts containing ruthenium oxide. This catalyst contains ruthenium existing in an oxide form loaded on a carrier which is difficult to be dissolved in inorganic acids. In this method, first, the catalyst containing ruthenium oxide is treated with hydrogen flow so that the ruthenium oxide on the carrier is reduced to ruthenium metal. Then it is treated with heated hydrochloric acid under a gas containing oxygen to dissolve the ruthenium metal on the carrier in a form of ruthenium(lll). Then the obtained ruthenium(lll) chloride solution is obtained is recovered for further treatment. This method has a low ruthenium recovery rate and is not suitable for recovery of catalysts containing ruthenium oxide which uses y-AI203 as the carrier. [0009] The aforementioned patents are focused on recovery of a single metal. There is no reports on recovery of the three metals Co, Ru, and Al in one method. Due to the different properties the metals, the recovery rate and purity of the metals changes dramatically in accordance with the recovery method.

[0024] In a class of this embodiment, the alkali fusing agents in step 3) areKOH and ΚΝΟ3, or NaOH and №ΝΟ3. The reactions occurring in step 3) are Ru02 + 2ΚΟΗ + ΚΝΟ3 = K2Ru04 + KN02 + H20; Ru + 2ΚΟΗ + 3ΚΝΟ3 = K2Ru04 + 3ΚΝΟ2 + H20; AI2O3 + 2ΚΟΗ = 2KAIO2 + H20; or Ru02 + 2NaOH + NaN03 = Na2Ru04 + NaN02 + H20; Ru + 2NaOH + 3NaN03 = Na2Ru04 + 3NaN02+ H20; AI2O3 + 2NaOH = 2NaAI02 + H20; The amount of the alkali fusing agents used is 2.5 times the theoretical amount thereof.

[0038] The advantages of the invention is summarized as follows: [0039] 1) The method of the invention can effectively separate and recover cobalt, ruthenium, and aluminum from waste Co-Ru/Al203 catalysts for Flscher-Tropsch synthesis. [0040] 2) The waste catalyst is treated by removal of hydrocarbon and reduction. The residue containing cobalt is separated in alkali fusion step, and then is leached in acids. Then via precipitation of cobalt by oxalic acid or ammonium oxalate, reduction of cobalt oxalate, and dissolution of cobalt metal in nitric acid, Co(N03)-6H2G with a purity higher than 99% is obtained. The obtained Co(N03)-6H20 does not contain ions, such as chloride and sulfide ions,which cause catalyst poisoning during Fischer-Tropsch process. Therefore, it can be directly used to prepare Fi sch ℮ r-Tro psch catalysts.

The layers disposed from the bottom of the crucible upward contain 21.31 g of ΚΟΗ, the waste catalyst, 10.65 g of ΚΟΗ, and 7.32 g of KN03, respectively. The crucible is then put into a muffle furnace. The muffle furnace is then heated and kept at 200°C for 1 hour. After that, the temperature of the muffle furnaceis increased by 3°C/min to 950°C using a temperature program to carry out alkali fusion reaction for 3 hours.

The pH of the solution is adjusted to 1.5 by using ammonium water with a mass fraction of 10℅, and the temperature of the solution is adjusted to 70°C. Then, the cobalt nitrate solution is slowly mixed with an ammonium oxalate solution having a pH of 1.5 and a temperature of 70°C to precipitate cobalt ions as cobalt oxalate while ammonium water with a mass fraction of 5℅ is added to the solution to maintain the pH thereof at 1.5 - 1.7. After precipitation is completed, the mixture is hot-filtered and the precipitate is washed with deionized water having a temperature of 65 - 80°C to neutrality. The washed precipitate is dehydrated with absolute ethanol to obtain a pink cobalt oxalate precipitate. The ammonium oxalate solution used is prepared by: adding deionized water until 44.30 g of solid ammonium oxalate ((NH4)2C204'H20) just dissolves, and adding 5% ammonium water to adjust the solution’s pH to 1.5. [0065] 7) The cobalt oxalate obtained in step 6) is dried in a dryer at 90°C, then put into a fluidized bed reactor and reduced in a mixed atmosphere containing H2 and N2 in a H2-to-N2 volume ratio of 2: 1 at 500°C, 0.8 MPa, and a space velocity of 3000 h'1 for 3 hours to obtain cobalt metal. [0066] 8) The cobalt metal obtained in step 7) is dissolved in a sufficient amount of 2mol/L dilute nitric acid. The obtained mixture is evaporated to obtain crystallized Co(N03)2-6H20. The crystallized Co(N03)2‘6H20 is cooled in a dryer and then weighed. The obtained Co(N03)2'6H20 is 25.59 g, the purity of which measured by GBT 15898-1995 method is 99.26%. The recovery rate of cobalt is 97.90%. [0067] 9) The filtrate of step 4) and the effluent of step 5) are mixed, and then 20 mL of absolute ethanol is slowly dropped into the mixture and stirred to covert pink ruthenate to black ruthenium hydroxide precipitate. Then the precipitate is filtered and washed with deionized water having a temperature of 65 - 80°C until the effluent becomes neutral and contains no sodium ions. After that, the precipitate is washed with absolute ethanol for three times. [0068] 10) The black ruthenium hydroxide obtained in step 9) is put into a three-necked flask having stirring and refluxing devices. Concentrated hydrochloric acid with a mass fraction of 36 - 38°C is added to the three-necked flask. The mixture is stirred at 91 - 95°C for 1.5 hours.

The recovery results are listed in Table 1. Table 1Co, Ru, and Al recovery at differentalkali fusion temperatures Example 5 6 7 8 Example 5 6 7 8 Alkali fusion temperature 951 °C 970°C 980°C 990°C Weight 11.56 g 11.51 g 11.33 g 11.43 g Co(N03)2-6H20 Purity 99.02% 99.38% 99.65% 99.23% Recovery rate 98.50% 98.43% 97.16% 97.60% Weight 0.501 g 0.499 g 0.490 g 0.497 g P-RuCI3-xH20 Ru content 37.27% 37.18% 38.04% 37.82% Recovery rate 96.48% 95.79% 96.26% 97.03% Weight 15.63 g 15.78 g 15.75 g 16.00 g Purity 99.27% 99.51% 99.36% 99.78% Recovery rate 92.77% 93.89% 93.62% 94.92% Aluminum oxide [0096] The data of Examples 1-8 indicates that when the temperature of the alkali fusion reaction is 900 - 1000°C, the purity of recovered Co(N03)2-6H20 is higher than 99%, and the recovery rates and purities of p-RuCl3'xH2G and aluminum oxide are relatively high. Table 1 indicates that limiting the temperature of the alkali fusion reaction in the range of 900 - 1000°C leads to a complete fusion of the ruthenium,the oxide thereof, and aluminum oxide with the alkali fusing agents. In this way, the complete separation of ruthenium and aluminum from cobalt is fulfilled. This is necessary for achieve ideal recovery results. Comparative example 1 [0097] To explain the importance of the method for the alkali fusion and the temperature thereof, in this comparative example, the mixing alkali fusion method of the prior art is carried out and the temperature of this method is controlled outside of the temperature range used in this invention. [0098] 20.04 g of waste C0-RU/AI2O3 catalyst is provided. Elemental analysis determines that the catalyst contains Co 30.05%, Ru 4.83%, and Al 27.90%.The recovery process is identical to that of Example 1, expect for that step 3) is changed to: The reduced waste catalyst obtained in step 2) and alkali fusing agents (ΚΟΗ 31.67 g, ΚΝΟ3 7.25 g) are mixed uniformly and put into a crucible. The crucible is then put into a muffle furnace. The muffle furnace is then heated and kept at 200°C for 1 hour to allow the sufficient contact between the reactants.After that, the temperature of the muffle furnace is elevated by 3°C/min to 650°C using a temperature program to carry out alkali fusion reaction for 4 hours. Next, the muffle furnace is cooled down to room temperature to obtain the alkali fusion product. The amount of alkali fusing agents used is 2.5 times the theoretical amount thereof. The other steps are not changed. The obtained Co(N03)2"6H20 is 31.13 g, the purity of which measured by GBT 15898-1995 method is 94.34%. The recovery rate of cobalt is 98.75%. The obtained P-RuCl3-xH20 crystal is 2.248 g. IGP-AES method determines that the P-RuCI3'xH20 has a ruthenium content of 37.22%. The recovery rate of ruthenium is 88.43%. The obtained aluminum oxide is 9.45 g and has anAI2C>3 content of 99.17%. The recovery rate of aluminum is 88.72%. [0099] Comparative example 1 shows that the traditional mixing alkali fusion method and a relatively low temperature of alkali fusion lead to a low purity of Co(NC>3)2"6H20 and low recovery rates of ruthenium and aluminum. It indicates that the traditional mixing alkali fusion method and a relatively low temperature of alkali fusion result in incomplete alkali fusion and, therefore, cause a poor recovery efficiency. Comparative example 2 [0100] To explain the importance of the temperature of the deionized water used for leaching the alkali fusion product, in this comparative example, the alkali fusion product is leached in deionized water having a temperature of 80°C. [0101] 20.68 g of waste Co-Ru/Al203 catalyst is provided. Elemental analysis determines that the catalyst contains Co 25.33%, Ru 3.07%, and Al 32.53%. The recovery process is identical to that of Example 2, expect for that the alkali fusion product obtained in step 3) is leached in deionized water having a temperature of 80°C (in a solid-to-liquid ratio of 1: 2) for 1 hour. The other steps are not changed. The obtained Co(N03)2-6H20 is 25.31 g, the purity of which measured by GBT 15898-1995 method is 99.14%. The recovery rate of cobalt is 96.99%. The obtained p-RuCI3-xH20 crystal is 1.604 g. ICP-AES method determines that the P-RuCI3-xH20 has a ruthenium content of 37.63%. The recovery rate of ruthenium is 95.09%. The obtained aluminum oxide is 10.34 g and has an Al203 content of 99.35%. The recovery rate of aluminum is 80.81%. [0102] Comparative example 1 shows that leaching the alkali fusion product in deionized water having a temperature of 80°C leads to a low recovery rate of aluminum. It indicates that when the temperature of the deionized water used for leaching the alkali fusion product is lower than that in the invention, aluminate in the alkali fusion product cannot be completely leached. Comparative example 3 [0103] To explain the importance of the parameters in addition of oxalic acid or ammonium oxalate, the temperature for reducing cobalt oxalate, and the parameters for determining the end of the carbonation reaction for separating aluminum hydroxide, in this comparative example, these parameters are controlled at values different from those in the invention. [0104] 20.01 g of waste Co-Ru/Al203 catalyst is provided. Elemental analysis determines that the catalyst contains Co 18.94%, Ru 2.11%, and Al 37.80%. [0105] Steps 1) - 5) are identical to those in Example 3. [0106] In step 6), the cobalt nitrate solution obtained in step 5) is adjusted to a pH of 1.5 by using ammonium water with a mass fraction of 10℅, and the temperature of the solution is adjusted to 70°C. Then, an oxalic acid solution having a pH of 1.5 and a temperature of 70°C is added into the cobalt nitrate solution and continuously stirred, and the pH of the mixture is adjusted to 1.5 by using ammonium water with a mass fraction of 5℅. Next, the mixture is hot-filtered and the precipitate is washed with deionized water having a temperature of 65 - 80°C to neutrality. The washed precipitate is dehydrated with absolute ethanol to obtain a pink cobalt oxalate precipitate. The oxalic acid solution used is prepared by: adding deionized water until 28.29 g of solid oxalic acid (H2C204-2H20) just dissolves, and adding 5℅ ammonium water to adjust the solution’s pH to 1.5. [0107] In step 7), the cobalt oxalate obtained in step 6) is dried in a dryer at 100°C, then put into a fluidized bed reactor and reduced in a mixed atmosphere containing H2 and N2 in a H2-to-N2 volume ratio of 1: 1 at 300°C, 1 MPa, and a space velocity of 4000 h'1 for 4 hours to obtain cobalt metal. [0108] Steps 8) - 10) are identical to those of Example 3. [0109] In step 11), the filtrate obtained from the filtration of the ruthenium hydroxide precipitate and the effluentobtained from washing the precipitate in step 9) are mixed together. The mixture is heated to 40°C, and C02 having a purity higher than 99.0℅ in introduced into the mixture at a flow rate of 800 mL/min and stirred to produce white aluminum hydroxide precipitate. The reaction is completed when the pH of the solution reaches 11.5. The precipitate is filtered and then washed with deionized water until the effluent becomes neutral and contains no sodium ions. After that, the precipitate is washed with absolute ethanol for three times. [0110] Step 12) is identical to that of Example 3. [0111] The obtained Co(N03)2‘6H20 is 17.03g, the purity of which measured by GBT 15898-1995 method is 99.09%. The recovery rate of cobalt is 90.16%. The obtained p-RuCl3-xH20 crystal is 1.085 g. ICP-AES method determines that the P-RuCI3-xH20 has a ruthenium content of 37.22%. The recovery rate of ruthenium is 95.61%. The obtained aluminum oxide is 11.47 g and has a purity of 99.04%. The recovery rate of aluminum is 79.47%. [0112] Comparative example 3 shows that traditional method of adding oxalic acid or ammonium oxalate at a relatively low temperature leads to a low recovery rate of cobalt; and that if carbonation for separating aluminum hydroxide is ended unsuitably, an incomplete reaction occurs and the recovery rate of aluminum is dramatically reduced. 1.
