Description of Related Art As the development of game industry, the designs of modern computer games or video games are more and more sophisticated with abundant contents and magnificent visual and sound effects. The industry keeps working on improving the reality and interactivity of the games. The improvements of the games usually cause users to indulge in the games. The users may spend too much time playing the games without sufficient rest, which endangers the health of the user. Some sudden death cases are reported that users stayed up for too much time playing the game and died of over-exhaustion. SUMMARY In one aspect, the present disclosure is related to a game interaction system. The game interaction system includes at least one game controller and a game console. The game controller is configured for detecting at least one physiological signal of at least one user, and for generating and outputting at least one corresponding physiological signal data according to the physiological signal. The game console is configured for receiving and analyzing the physiological signal data, and for generating at least one corresponding physiological signal parameter. The game console is further configured for determining whether the physiological signal parameter reaches at least one setting value, and if yes, the game console performs at least one corresponding instruction. In another aspect, the present disclosure is related to a game interaction method. The game interaction method includes the following steps: utilizing at least one game controller to detect at least one physiological signal of at least one user; generating and outputting at least one corresponding physiological signal data according to the physiological signal; utilizing a game console to receive and analyze the at least one physiological signal data, and to generate at least one corresponding physiological signal parameter; utilizing the game console to determine whether the physiological signal parameter reaches at least one setting value; and if yes, utilizing the game console to perform at least one corresponding instruction. By integrating the systems for measuring physiological signals (e.g., electrocardiography signals, body temperature, breath, the carbon dioxide concentration, sweat, and so on) into a game controller, corresponding game functions can be executed according to the physiological status of the user. Consequently, the game becomes more interesting and realistic. Moreover, the physiological signals of the user are analyzed to determine whether the user suffers from fatigue. If the user is detected to suffer from fatigue, a warning message will be outputted or the game will be terminated. Consequently, the user will not overindulge in the game and hence endangerment to the health of the user can be avoided.

Reference is made first to FIG. 1. FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram of a game interaction system 100 in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure. The game interaction system 100 includes at least one game controller 120 and a game console 140.

In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the game console 140 is a personal computer, a laptop, a tablet computer, a smart phone or a video game console (e.g., Xbox One, Wii, Wii U or PS4). The game controller 120 is configured for detecting at least one physiological signal 110 of at least one user (not depicted), and for generating and outputting at least one corresponding physiological signal data 130 according to the physiological signal 110. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the physiological signal 110 is a electrocardiography signal, body temperature, breath, the carbon dioxide concentration of the gas exhaled by the at least one user, sweat or a combination thereof. The game console 140 is configured for receiving and analyzing the physiological signal data 130, and for generating at least one corresponding physiological signal parameter (not depicted). The game controller 120 can be electrically connected with the game console 140 by utilizing a transmission cable, or they can be connected wirelessly. The game console 140 is further configured for determining whether the physiological signal parameter reaches at least one setting value (not depicted). If yes, the game console 140 performs at least one corresponding instruction. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the abovementioned setting value is a heart beats value, a heart rate value, a electrocardiography sample, a body temperature value, a body temperature changing rate value, a breath times value, a breath rate value, a carbon dioxide concentration of the gas exhaled by the user, a sweat amount value or a combination thereof. In another embodiment of the present disclosure, the abovementioned instruction includes a change of a corresponding game character, activating a hidden stage, outputting a warning message, terminating the game, turning the game console off and a combination thereof. In an example, the game controller 120 is configured for detecting the electrocardiography signal, breath and the carbon dioxide concentration of the gas exhaled by the user, and for generating and outputting corresponding electrocardiography signal data and breath signal data. The game console 140 is configured for receiving the abovementioned electrocardiography signal data and breath signal data, and for generating a corresponding electrocardiography sample, a corresponding breath rate value and a corresponding carbon dioxide concentration value of the gas exhaled by the user as the abovementioned physiological signal parameters. The game console 140 compares the abovementioned electrocardiography sample, breath rate value and carbon dioxide concentration value with a electrocardiography sample setting value, a breath rate setting value and a carbon dioxide concentration setting value, respectively. If the abovementioned electrocardiography sample, breath rate value, carbon dioxide concentration value, or its combination reaches the abovementioned corresponding setting values, the game console 140 determines that the user suffers from fatigue, and outputs a warning message accordingly. The warning message warns the user that he/she suffers from fatigue and suggests the user to stop playing the game. In another example, if the game console 140 determines that the use suffers from fatigue, the game console 140 terminates the game or turn itself off. In another example, the game controller 120 is configured for detecting the electrocardiography signal and the breath of the user, and for generating and outputting corresponding electrocardiography signal data and breath signal data. The game console 140 is configured for receiving the abovementioned electrocardiography signal data and breath signal data, and for generating the corresponding heart rate value and breath rate value as the abovementioned physiological signal parameters. The game console 140 compares the abovementioned heart rate value and breath rate value with a heart rate setting value and breath rate setting value, respectively. If the abovementioned heart rate value, breath rate value or its combination reaches the abovementioned corresponding setting values, the game console 140 changes the status of game characters accordingly (e.g., an improved attacking ability status or an improved defending ability status). In still another example, the game controller 120 is configured for detecting the sweat of the user, and for generating and outputting corresponding sweat signal data. The game console 140 is configured for receiving the abovementioned sweat signal data, and for generating the corresponding sweat amount value as the abovementioned physiological signal parameters. The game console 140 compares the abovementioned sweat amount value with a sweat amount setting value. If the abovementioned sweat amount setting value reaches the abovementioned corresponding setting value, the game console 140 changes the status of a game character to a status of sweating.
