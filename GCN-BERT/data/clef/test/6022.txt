Synthesis of Compound 31
First, 1,3-diaminopropane (73.7 mg, 1.0 mmol) was dissolved in CH2Cl2 (10 mL), and a solution obtained by dissolving succinimidyl 4-(azidomethyl)benzoate[1] (274.2 mg, 1.0 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (10 mL) was slowly added dropwise (drop time: 25 minutes). After 18 hours, TLC (chloroform:methanol=3:1+1% NH3 aq., UV and ninhydrin reagent) was performed to confirm that the raw material did not remain in the reaction solution. Column chromatography was performed using an elution solvent of chloroform:methanol=10:1+1% NH3 aq. A yellow liquid of a compound 31 (197.1 mg, 0.8 mmol, 84%) was obtained.
