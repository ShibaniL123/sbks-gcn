(E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-5-fluoro-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1, 2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-5-fluoro-2- (2-fluoro-2- methylpropyl) -3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzofuro[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 73e (300 mg, 0.63 mmol) was dissolved in 20 mL of methanol, then 10mL of 0.6 M sodium hydroxide solution was added. After stirring for 12 hours, the reaction was stopped. 10% citric acid was added until the pH of the reaction solution is acidic. The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane three times. The organic phases were combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by thin layer chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound (E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1R,3R/1S,3S)-5-fluoro-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo furo[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid 73 (200 mg, yield 69%) as a yellow solid.
