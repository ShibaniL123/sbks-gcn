More particularly, the present invention relates to implantable structures and devices; particularly, medical devices, encased in extracellular matrix (ECM) based pouches and/or include ECM based coatings that effectuate modulated healing of damaged tissue and regeneration of new tissue structures with site-specific structural and functional properties. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION As is well known in the art, treatment of various medical conditions commonly involves implantation of medical devices and/or insertion of medical instruments into a body. Illustrative is the implantation or deployment of heart valves to regulate the flow of blood through cardiovascular vessels, and pacemakers to control abnormal heart rhythms. Implantable medical devices; particularly, cardiovascular implants, have unique blood biocompatibility requirements to ensure that the device is not rejected (as in the case of natural tissue materials for heart valves and grafts for heart transplants) or that adverse thrombogenic (clotting) or hemodynamic (blood flow) responses are avoided. Several cardiovascular implants, such as heart valves, are formed from natural tissue. Illustrative are the heart valves disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,719,788 and 5,480,424 to Cox. The disclosed bioprostheses can, however, be affected by gradual calcification, which can, and in many instances will, lead to the eventual stiffening and tearing of the implant. Many non-bioprosthetic implants are, however, fabricated from various metals and polymeric materials, and other exotic materials, such as pyrolytic carbon-coated graphite. For example, pacemakers, defibrillators, leads, and other similar cardiovascular implants are often fabricated from Ni—Co—Cr alloy, Co—Cr—Mo alloy, titanium, and Ti-6Al-4V alloy, stainless steel, and various biocompatible polymeric materials. Artificial heart valves are often fabricated from various combinations of nylon, silicone, titanium, Teflon™ polyacetal, graphite and pyrolytic carbon. Artificial hearts and ventricular assist devices are often fabricated from various combinations of stainless steel, cobalt alloy, titanium, Ti-6Al-4V alloy, carbon fiber reinforced composites, polyurethanes, Biolon™, Hemothane™, Dacron™, polysulfone, and other thermoplastics. Finally, catheters and guide wires are often fabricated from Co—Ni or stainless steel wire. In many instances, the wire is encased in a polymeric material. As is well known in the art, several major problems are often encountered when a medical device (or other device, e.g., tracking apparatus) fabricated from one of the aforementioned materials is implanted in the body. A major problem that is often encountered after implantation of such a device in the body is inflammation of surrounding tissue. Another major problem is the high incidence of infection. A further problem that is often encountered after implantation of the medical device in the body is the formation of blood clots (thrombogenesis). One additional problem that is also often encountered is the degradation, e.g., corrosion, of medical device leads and, thereby, premature failure of the device after implantation in the body. Most medical devices are designed to be implanted in the body for an extended period of time. However, when a harsh biological response (or premature failure of the device) is encountered after implantation, it is often necessary to remove the device through a secondary surgical procedure; which can, and in many instances will, result in undesirable pain and discomfort to the patient, and possibly additional trauma to the adjacent tissue. In addition to the pain and discomfort, the patient must be subjected to an additional time consuming and complicated surgical procedure with the attendant risks of surgery. There is thus a need to provide medical devices that are configured for implantation in the body, and substantially reduce or eliminate the harsh biological responses associated with conventional implanted medical devices, including inflammation, infection and thrombogenesis. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide encasement structures that are configured to encase a medical device therein and that substantially reduce or eliminate the harsh biological responses associated with conventional implanted medical devices, including inflammation, infection and thrombogenesis, when implanted in the body. It is another object of the present invention to provide ECM encasement structures that are configured to encase a medical device therein, and effectively improve biological functions and/or promote modulated healing of adjacent tissue and the growth of new tissue when implanted in the body. It is another object of the present invention to provide ECM encasement structures that are configured to encase a medical device therein and administer one or more pharmacological or therapeutic agents when implanted in the body. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide medical devices that are configured for insertion or implantation in the body and exhibit enhanced biocompatibility and hemocompatibility when inserted or implanted therein.

The disclosure is further offered to enhance an understanding and appreciation for the inventive principles and advantages thereof, rather than to limit in any manner the invention. The invention is defined solely by the appended claims, including any amendments made during the pendency of this application, and all equivalents of those claims as issued. As stated above, it is understood that, although the present invention is described and illustrated in connection with encased medical devices, the invention is not limited to medical devices. According to the invention, the extracellular matrix (ECM) structures and compositions of the invention can also be employed to encase other devices, including, by way of example, a tracking device. It is also understood that, although the present invention is described and illustrated in connection with a pacemaker, the invention is not limited to the noted medical device. Indeed, as stated above, the ECM encasement structures and compositions of the invention can also be employed to encase other medical devices, including without limitation, a defibrillator, synthetic heart valve, ventricular assist device, artificial heart, physiological sensor, catheter, and associated components thereof, including electrical leads and lines associated therewith.

According to the invention, upon deployment of an ECM encasement structure having a medical device therein or a medical device (or instrument) coated with an ECM composition of the invention, modulated healing and regeneration of tissue structures with site-specific structural and functional properties are effectuated. The phrase “modulated healing”, as used herein, and variants of this language generally refer to the modulation (e.g., alteration, delay, retardation, reduction, etc.) of a process involving different cascades or sequences of naturally occurring tissue repair in response to localized tissue damage or injury, substantially reducing their inflammatory effect. Modulated healing, as used herein, includes many different biologic processes, including epithelial growth, fibrin deposition, platelet activation and attachment, inhibition, proliferation and/or differentiation, connective fibrous tissue production and function, angiogenesis, and several stages of acute and/or chronic inflammation, and their interplay with each other. For example, in some embodiments, the ECM compositions of the invention are specifically formulated (or designed) to alter, delay, retard, reduce, and/or detain one or more of the phases associated with healing of damaged tissue, including, but not limited to, the inflammatory phase (e.g., platelet or fibrin deposition), and the proliferative phase. In some embodiments, “modulated healing” refers to the ability of an ECM composition to alter a substantial inflammatory phase (e.g., platelet or fibrin deposition) at the beginning of the tissue healing process. As used herein, the phrase “alter a substantial inflammatory phase” refers to the ability of an ECM composition to substantially reduce the inflammatory response at an injury site. In such an instance, a minor amount of inflammation may ensue in response to tissue injury, but this level of inflammation response, e.g., platelet and/or fibrin deposition, is substantially reduced when compared to inflammation that takes place in the absence of an ECM composition of the invention. For example, the ECM compositions discussed herein have been shown experimentally to delay or alter the inflammatory response associated with damaged tissue, as well as excessive formation of connective fibrous tissue following tissue damage or injury. The ECM compositions have also been shown experimentally to delay or reduce fibrin deposition and platelet attachment to a blood contact surface following tissue damage. In some embodiments of the invention, “modulated healing” refers to the ability of an ECM composition of the invention to induce host tissue proliferation, bioremodeling, including neovascularization, e.g., vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and intussusception, and regeneration of tissue structures with site-specific structural and functional properties. Accordingly, the ECM compositions discussed herein provide an excellent bioabsorbable cellular interface suitable for use with a medical device or surgical instrument. As indicated above, in one embodiment of the invention, the ECM encasement structures comprise an ECM based pocket or pouch that is configured to receive a medical device therein. According to the invention, the encased medical device and associated components can comprise, without limitation, a pacemaker, defibrillator, synthetic heart valve, ventricular assist device, artificial heart, physiological sensor, catheter, and the electrical leads and lines associated therewith. According to the invention, the entire medical device or a portion thereof can be encased in the ECM encasement structure. Thus, in some embodiments of the invention, the medical device housing and a portion of the device leads are encased in an ECM based pouch. In the noted embodiments, the device leads can also be coated with an ECM composition of the invention. In some embodiments of the invention, the ECM encasement structure includes at least one lead conduit, more preferably, a plurality of lead conduits that are configured to encase the medical device leads. In a preferred embodiment, the ECM encasement structure comprises (or is constructed of) an ECM composition that includes at least one ECM material (hereinafter “ECM pouch”).
