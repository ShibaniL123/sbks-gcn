CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application No. 62/020,183, filed Jul. 2, 2014. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to paint applicators, specifically rollers and shields, for precision in painting large scale projects. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Painting rooms or walls often requires protecting areas that are not intended to be painted. Traditionally this has been done through slow but precise painting, using tarps to cover areas, and using painter's tape. All of these have problems such as increased time spent on projects, inadequate protection, and damages due to adhesive materials. Some devices utilize a method that creates a gap between the paint area and area that should remain unpainted, but this gap is of a size that either requires extreme care or the need to fill in the gap with a more precise means later. An improved paint applicator is needed that allows a user speed, adequate protection, and precision while painting, for example, walls near the ceiling. BRIEF SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a shield for a paint roller that allows for quick and precise painting of one surface while keeping an adjacent surface free of paint. One embodiment of the invention includes shield that may be attached to different types of existing paint rollers. Another embodiment of the invention has a handle attached to a frame, which attaches to a shield and roller. The handle allows for an easy grip and the frame includes a neck. The neck may have alternate configurations depending on the type of work such as for walls generally, or with a longer neck for high ceilings. In one configuration the neck forms an “s” shape with the handle extending away from the lower leg of the “s” and the shield extending off of the upper leg. The frame also includes a roller to which the roller cover is applied. The roller cover is the portion that applies paint to a wall. In one embodiment, the roller itself is connected to the frame and moves concentrically using the leg of the frame it is attached to as an axle. Alternatively there may be device that rotates concentrically about the leg of the frame that the roller cover attaches to. In this embodiment the roller has a ¾ inch outer diameter while the roller cover has an inner diameter of ¾ inch and a length of 4 inches. The frame and shield may be designed to accommodate a variety of roller covers. The shield has a stem and a plate. The shield is designed for the planar plate portion to be flush against a surface, such as a ceiling. This surface, such as a ceiling, is generally perpendicular to the surface that is intended to be painted, such as the wall. The stem, which is optionally shaped cylindrically, allows the shield to attach to the frame. In one embodiment, this is achieved by the stem being hollow and having one base that is open. The second base is attached to the plate. In one embodiment, the plate is substantially planar, circular and with one edge flattened, as though it have been cut at a secant line through the circular plate. The diameter in this embodiment is 1½ inches, but other embodiments may have different sizes. The size of the shield is based on the diameter of the roller cover such that all of the edge of the roller cover will be blocked by the shield except for the flattened portion of the shield. However during painting, the flat edge may be flush with the ceiling and thus blocking any paint from the roller cover to travel past the shield. This plate has a width that allows the roller cover to come within a very close proximity of area that is not intended to be painted, such as a ceiling. In this embodiment it has a 1/64 inch thickness with a beveled ⅛ inch edge angled at 45 degrees away from the ceiling (or other surface not intended to be painted). There is no angled portion on the flat edge of the shield that has been cut as though through a secant line. The shield is designed such that the flat portion will press against wall that is intended to be painted and can be arranged at whatever angle the user desires. Once placed the shield will not rotate but will stay fixed with the frame as the roller and roller cover rotate about an axle formed by the frame. Optionally, the shield is made from polypropylene #5, but may be made from other materials or plastics. In another embodiment of the invention, the beveled edge may have different proportions of bevel angle and bevel length. In another embodiment, the diameter of the shield can differ from the 1½ inch. This diameter is selected to utilize an appropriately reduced amount of materials necessary for a shield for a roller cover with an inner diameter of ¾ inches. The diameter of the shield, the location of the secant line forming the flattened portion of shield, and size of the roller cover may all differ from the current embodiment, though they must remain in relation to one another such that the diameter of the shield is greater than the outer diameter of the roller cover, but allowing the roller cover to extend past the flat portion. It is possible in other embodiments that the shield not be generally circular. Other shapes may be used. However there must be one flat edge that does not extend past the roller cover and allows the paint to be applied to the intended surface. In another embodiment, the stem of the shield can be altered to configure to differently shaped termini of frames. In another embodiment, the frame may be configured in a different formation such as straight or an “s” shape with a handle extending perpendicular to lower leg of the “s”. The present invention relates to a paint roller shield comprising a plate with a planar surface configured to have a beveled periphery with at least one flat edge along the periphery and a nonplanar surface configured to attach to a paint roller device. The paint roller shield may have variations. The plate, in a variant, is substantially round with one flat edge configured to allow paint to be applied to one particular surface. The attachment to the paint roller device, in one variant, is a hollow cylindrical tube configured to fit over the end of a paint roller device and stay fixed in relation to a roller cover, which applies paint. The beveled edge, in a variant, is angled between 5° and 85° and slopes outwardly away from the planar surface. In another variant of the beveled edge, it has a length of about ⅛ of an inch. In yet another variant of the beveled edge, the flat edge is not beveled. Further, in one variant, the flat edge of the plate is configured such that with a substantially circular plate edge is configured as a missing portion of the circle defined by a secant. Variants of the shield may be configured with a diameter of at least 1.5 inches to accommodate a 4 inch roller cover with an inner diameter of 0.75 inches, but may also be configured with similar ratios depending on the size of the roller cover. In one variant, the paint roller device and shield are designed as a matching set.

After reading this description, it will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art how the invention can be implemented in different and alternative environments. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All patents, applications, published applications and other publications referred to herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. If a definition set forth in this section is contrary to or otherwise inconsistent with a definition set forth in applications, published applications and other publications that are herein incorporated by reference, the definition set forth in this document prevails over the definition that is incorporated herein by reference. The following reference numbers are used in this document: 100 shield 110 stem 112 hollow interior 120 plate 122 beveled edge 124 flat portion 124 a and 124b to points forming a secant line 400 roller cover 410 frame 412 frame terminus 600 handle 610 roller The present invention relates to a paint roller assembly that includes a shield 100. In one embodiment, FIGS. 1 and 2 show two different perspective views of the shield 100. The shield 100 has a stem 110 and a plate 120. The stem 110 is generally cylindrical and has a hollow interior 112 leading to the exterior on one side. The stem 110 is connected to the middle of the plate 120 at the other side. The plate 120 is generally flat and round and the plate 120 has a beveled edge 122 extending downwards from the plate. In one embodiment, the beveled edge 122 is at a 45 degree angle. Other embodiments can have beveled edges 122 that range from 5 to 85 degrees. In the present embodiment, the beveled edge 122 is at a length of ⅛ of an inch. The plate 120 and beveled edge 122 have a flat portion 124 cut out from the plate 120. Referring to FIG. 3, a top view of the shield 120 is provided. The flat portion 124 is formed as though a section were cut off of a circle by a secant line connecting 124a and 124b. This means that the flat portion 124 itself has no beveled edge 122 but can rest flush against a wall while the plate 120 rests against a perpendicular ceiling. Referring to FIG. 4, the shield 100 is illustrated with a roller frame 410 and roller cover 400. The hollow interior 112 is visible in this view and can be attached at this point to the frame terminus 412. The shield 100 does not rotate about this terminus 412. In this embodiment it remains removably attached as can be seen in FIG. 5. In another embodiment the shield 100 may remain permanently attached to the terminus 412. FIG. 5 further shows that the diameter of the shield 100, which is 1½ inches in this embodiment, is configured to extend past the edge of a roller cover 400. An exception is the flat portion 124, which is designed to have roller cover 400 extend past it by cutting the secant line from 124a to 124b. FIG. 6 shows the frame 410, roller 610, and handle 600. This is the structure that a roller cover 400 and shield 100 are attached to. The roller 610 is where the roller cover 400 is placed. In this embodiment the roller 610 has a ¾ inch outer diameter while the roller cover 400 has an inner diameter of ¾ inch and a length of 4 inches. FIG. 7 shows an alternate configuration for the shield 100. In this particular alternate configuration the shield 100 is of a square design containing a beveled edge 122 along three of the edges and leaving a flat portion 124 with no beveled edge 122. The distance from 124a to 124b is at least as long as the outer diameter of the roller cover 400. In another embodiment the roller and roller cover may differ from the 4 inch length. The most commonly used lengths would be between 4 to 6 inches. (1) In a variant of the paint roller shield, a plate with a planar surface has a beveled periphery with at least one flat edge along the periphery and a nonplanar surface configured to attach to a paint roller device. (2) In another variant, the plate is substantially round with one flat edge configured to shield at least one particular surface from paint, while painting another surface. (3) In a further variant, the beveled edge is angled between 5° and 85° and slopes outwardly away from the planar surface. (4) In still another variant, the paint roller shield comprises a hollow cylindrical tube configured to fit over the end of a paint roller device and remain rotatably fixed in relation to a rotating roller cover, which applies paint. (5) In yet a further variant, the paint roller shield has a beveled periphery at a length of about ⅛ of an inch. (6) In a variant of the paint roller shield, the flat edge is unbeveled (not beveled). (7) In another variant, the paint roller shield has a flat edge of the plate configured such that with a substantially circular plate edge is configured as a missing portion of the circle defined by a secant. (8) In a further variant, the shield is configured with a diameter of at least 1.5 inches to accommodate a 4 inch roller cover with an inner diameter of 0.75 inches. (9) In a yet another variant, the paint roller shield is connected to a paint roller device, wherein the shield is scaled in size to match the size of the roller cover of the paint roller device to which it is attached. (10) In a variant, the paint roller device and shield are designed as a matching set. (11) In another variant, a paint roller shield comprises a plate with a planar surface having a substantially round and beveled periphery with at least one flat edge along the periphery and a nonplanar surface configured to attach to a paint roller device. The beveled edge is angled between 5° and 85° and slopes outwardly away from the planar surface. A hollow cylindrical tube configured to fit over the end of a paint roller device and remain rotatably fixed in relation to a rotating roller cover, which applies paint. A plan view of the plate, the flat edge comprises the edge of a cutout from a circle at a secant line.
