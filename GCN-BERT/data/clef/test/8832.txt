CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of the following provisional applications, each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety: U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/981,533, filed Apr. 18, 2014; and U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/045,989, filed Sep. 4, 2014. BACKGROUND 1. Field This disclosure relates generally to networked scent-diffusing devices and applications thereof. 2. Description of the Related Art Of the five traditional senses, scent is strongly linked to memory. We recall what we see with poor accuracy after one month, while we remember what we smell with good accuracy after one year. This phenomenon is attributed to the intimate connection between the olfactory bulb and the brain's limbic system, often referred to as the “emotional brain.” Recognizing that the sense of smell is the most emotive of our five senses, it is a valuable element of brand communications and experiential marketing. Said differently, scent is very effective in delivering complete, multi-sensorial environments, since it is the most effective sense for creating lasting impressions. Leading companies in industry sectors like hospitality, retail, gaming, real estate, health care, and senior living recognize the power of “scent marketing” and are seeking service solutions for their commercial establishments that are effective, safe, and easy to use. However, precise, consistent and measurable wide area dispersion of fragrances has been a significant challenge for early service providers in this emerging market. Their scent solutions provide widely varying experiences as the quality of scent impressions deteriorates over time and in changing environments. Some current scent dispersion technologies provide stand-alone solutions that are managed locally by on-site employees or local subcontractors. Since the fragrance dispersed by these commercial scent devices is set manually and often changed over time, it is extremely difficult to ensure a consistent level of fragrance within brand standards across all locations. Common scent dispersion problems include undiagnosed malfunctioning of dispensers, incorrect dispenser settings, and device tampering, as well as scent “blindness” which occurs when employees who work within a scented location, become insensitive to a fragrance, leading them to make unwarranted changes to manual settings. Given the great variability of conditions across local sites, it is very difficult to accurately predict the replacement dates for scent “refill cartridges” (elements often used to contain scent oils or other sources of fragrances in dispensing systems). As a result, there are many venues with no fragrance dispersion when cartridges run empty, while other venues experience wasted scent oil, increased expense, and disposal issues when cartridges are replaced prematurely. Consequently, current scent solutions deployed in multi-site commercial businesses make it difficult for corporate brand executives, local site managers, and maintenance personnel to establish and maintain a consistent “acceptable” or “approved” scent concentration across their venues. Their inability to adequately control the olfactory portion of brand identity is a constant source of frustration, as site surveys indicate that a significant fraction of venues on any given day are not delivering the brand's targeted sensory experience. There remains a need for a scent management system to provide wide area dispersion of a fragrance in accordance with a desired profile of fragrance in a manner that is consistent, precise, and controllable via a remote or a local network. SUMMARY Among other things, the present disclosure addresses these local “compliance” and brand management issues by enabling effective, centralized management of remotely deployed scent systems, including, without limitation, using microprocessor-controlled and networked diffusion devices that deliver data streams to a centralized network operations center (or NOC), which may be staffed by experienced operators using enterprise class software. Through this managed service, and with the help of precise local tools and enabling components, commercial businesses can ensure precise, wide-area fragrance delivery that is consistent with brand standards over time and across locations. A wide range of enabling components and technologies are disclosed herein for such a scent management system. In one embodiment, there may be an electrical contact that may need to be made between the package and the device when the package is installed. An electrical feature on the package may contact an electrical feature on the device. If contact is made, the package contents may be dispensed. If contact is not made, the package contents may not be dispensed and an alert may be sent over the network. In an aspect, a scent cartridge for a networked scent diffusion device may include a reservoir that holds a liquid and an atomizer head assembly, and an anti-tampering identifier associated with at least one of the reservoir and the atomizer head assembly, wherein the scent diffusion from the device is based on a state of the anti-tampering identifier. If the scent diffusion device does not recognize the anti-tampering identifier, an alert may be sent over a network, and scent may not be dispensed. If the cartridge is removed from the device, resulting in the device no longer recognizing the anti-tampering identifier, an alert is sent over a network. The state of the anti-tampering identifier is changed based on the proximity of the networked diffusion device to a specified network zone. In some embodiments, the atomizer head assembly includes an orifice plate containing a flow restriction orifice for passing compressed gas to be mixed with liquid before passing through an atomizing orifice. The anti-tampering identifier may be mechanical such as a dip switch, or the like. The anti-tampering identifier may be electronic, such as an RFID, bar/QSR code, and the like. The anti-tampering identifier may be a departure from a network zone of the networked scent diffusion device. The anti-tampering identifier may be an error or an unexpected reading of a liquid level sensor of the networked scent diffusion device. The anti-tampering identifier may be a disconnection of an electrical contact disposed on at least one of the reservoir and the atomizer head assembly from the networked scent diffusion device. The anti-tampering identifier may be an RFID tag associated with at least one of the reservoir and the atomizer head assembly. The atomizer head assembly may include an orifice plate containing a flow restriction orifice for passing compressed gas to be mixed with liquid before passing through an atomizing orifice. The anti-tampering identifier may be a mechanical feature of at least one of the reservoir and the atomizer head assembly. The anti-tampering identifier may relate to an electric field of at least one of the reservoir and the atomizer head assembly. In an aspect, a scent cartridge for a networked scent diffusion device, may include a reservoir that holds a liquid and an atomizer head assembly, wherein the atomizer head assembly includes an orifice plate containing a flow restriction orifice for passing compressed gas to be mixed with liquid before passing through an atomizing orifice and an RFID tag associated with at least one of the reservoir and the atomizer head assembly, wherein when an RFID reader operably connected to the scent diffusion device recognizes the RFID tag, scent is dispensed from the cartridge. In an aspect, a package for use with a scent diffusion device may include a reservoir that holds a liquid and an atomizer head assembly, wherein the reservoir is joined to the atomizer head assembly at a top edge of the reservoir and a tube for the transportation of the liquid in the reservoir, wherein the tube is joined to the atomizer head assembly on a first end while a second end of the tube extends below the surface of the liquid. A gas inlet passage of the atomizer head assembly may have one end in fluid communication with a compressed air source and a second end of the gas inlet passage in fluid communication with an orifice plate comprising a flow restriction orifice. A mixing chamber of the atomizer head assembly may be separated from the gas inlet passage by the orifice plate, the mixing chamber having a first wall opposite the orifice plate comprising an atomizing orifice and a second wall comprising an opening in fluid communication with the tube. An expansion chamber may be in fluid communication with the atomizing orifice and a baffle chamber, the baffle chamber having an outlet to a surrounding environment. A gas flowing into the gas inlet passage through the flow restriction orifice generates a relatively low pressure region in the mixing chamber that causes liquid from the reservoir to be drawn into the mixing chamber through the tube where it joins the flow path of the gas out of the restrictor orifice creating a mixture of gas and liquid which then becomes atomized when it passes through the atomizing orifice. The liquid reservoir may have a substantially cup shaped geometry. The top edge of the reservoir may be joined to the atomizer head assembly by one of an ultrasonic weld and/or a twist lock with o-ring seal. In an aspect, an atomizing diffusion device may include a floating magnet disposed within a track inside at least one package with liquid for the diffusion device, wherein as a liquid level inside the package changes, the floating magnet moves substantially vertically along the track. The device may further include at least one Hall effect sensor or Hall effect switch disposed outside the liquid at a position to enable sensing the position of the floating magnet in the track. The device may also include a processor, operatively coupled to the Hall effect sensor or Hall effect switch, for generating a signal indicative of the sensed position of the floating magnet and a control instruction for a switch based on the signal and a switch, operatively coupled to the processor, that receives the control instruction from the processor, wherein the control instruction causes the diffusion device to switch from utilizing one package in the diffusion device to utilizing a different package in the diffusion device. The switch may be a solenoid switch. The device of claim may further include a scheduling facility that receives the signal and predicts when the package will be depleted of liquid or determines a package replenishment schedule.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION In an aspect, the scent management system provides businesses with a managed service for precise, wide-area fragrance delivery directed at using scent to deliver memorable brand impressions and exceptional customer experiences. By building intelligence into equipment deployed on customers' premises, and by managing the equipment using a global network and a centralized set of software applications, the scent management system provides unprecedented quality and control of a remotely managed scent service for customers and ensures that scent management services are efficacious, reliable and consistent. Such a scent management system is capable of ensuring a defined level of quality based on intelligence built into the system, from the diffuser device to the centrally managed network operations center (NOC), which monitors device performance across all customers and across all devices for each customer. The scent management system is capable of delivering identical scent impressions across all locations, if so desired, through measured fragrance output and in-space metering for precise concentration. The scent management system provides a managed scent service that delivers a consistent brand impression through the precise, dynamic control of a network of scent diffusion devices in either a remote or a local fashion. Features of the scent management system, such as two-way communication with networked scent diffusion devices to receive data from the devices and to control the devices remotely, coupled with features of the devices, including sensors and/or programming to switch between installed packages of fragrance, enables the scent management system to be deployed as part of multiple service offerings, including self-service and full-service models of operation. In a self-service model, users may select settings for the devices and receive indications regarding replenishment, such as through a customer application. In a full-service model, settings may be selected and modified by the NOC not just for one location but across as many locations as required to conform to brand management goals, replenishment alerts may go to the NOC which is then responsible for managing the replenishment, and the like. Communication with the NOC allows users the confidence that the devices in a space are operating as desired without having to be hands-on with the devices or with a control application for the device. Of course, the flexibility of the scent management system enables users (such as non-NOC staff) to utilize control applications to monitor and control the scent diffusion devices as desired. The system enables intelligent, deterministic delegation of roles, authorities, and permissions across the network of diffusers to preserve brand integrity. Users can control roles, authorities, and permissions across a hierarchical organization (e.g. parent company/corporate, franchise, location) to enable diffusion device control on a local level, such as on a location basis, or at a corporate level, and the like. The scent management system may be useful not just for scent branding and delivering consistent scent impressions, but also for odor mitigation, odor neutralization, product advertising, aromatherapy/stress reduction, and the like. Other functional benefits will be described herein. The scent management system may include one or more diffusion devices. Each diffusion device may contain a processor, such as a microcontroller, capable of reporting information (telemetry data) about diffuser status via the Internet to one or more Cloud-based business applications. The microcontroller may be capable of controlling the units autonomously, based on control instructions sent by the business applications. The business applications store historical data about the diffusion devices, which enables reporting on this data and mining of the data in order to improve scent management services. A NOC may be utilized to monitor the health of the end-user diffusion devices, and may react to alerts by adjusting the settings of the diffusion devices, or by creating a work order (e.g. to roll a truck, e-mail an on-site contact, etc.) in order to address a service issue or replenishment issue. Alternatively, devices may be self-serve, non-NOC managed. In embodiments, the networked diffusion devices form part of an Internet of Things. In an embodiment, the scent management system may include: a diffusion device with built-in intelligence enabled by a built-in microcontroller module, plus communication abilities enabled by wireless local and wide area network communication modules; and diffusion device network configurations that support the intelligent management of fragrance dispersion, either locally within a fragranced environment, or remotely by one or more centralized or distributed network operations center(s) (NOCs) staffed by scent system administrators. The scent management system includes business processes enabled by the diffusion devices, deployed within defined scent dispersion network configurations. Throughout this specification, the terms “scent device”, “scent dispersion device”, “diffuser device”, “diffuser”, “scent diffusion device”, or “scent diffuser device” may be used interchangeably with each other and with the term “diffusion device”, except where context indicates otherwise. It should be understood that the use of scented liquids in the diffusion device is exemplary of one of the kinds of liquids that may be used in the scent management system. Indeed, scent neutralization liquids, disinfectant, cleansing or other liquids may also be used in the diffusion devices. Throughout this specification, the terms “cartridge”, “package”, and “reservoir” are used interchangeably with each other, except where context indicates otherwise. Various aspects of the scent management system are described herein. Further, it should be understood that the devices may work to dispense any liquid, such as in a gas or vapor colloidal mixture. FIG. 1 depicts an exemplary architecture 100 for a scent management system. In this embodiment, a master diffusion device 102 is in communication with one or more slave diffusion devices 104 and a server 108, such as a cloud server running cloud-based business applications. In this embodiment, the device 102 communicates with the server 108 to receive control instructions, systems updates, and the like from and to transmit telemetry data and the like to a NOC 118. Communication may be through a cellular connection. The devices 102, 104 may be in communication with environmental, or have onboard, sensors 110. NOC user devices 114 may communicate through the server 108 with the devices 102, 104. A customer control device 120 may be used to control the devices 102, 104 through the server 108. An advertiser network user interface 112 may be in communication with the server 108. In an embodiment, the scent diffusion device may include a cartridge-based removable repository for fragrance oil or other liquid to be diffused, and a diffuser that atomizes the fragrance oil into particles to deliver targeted and controllable concentration levels of the fragrance oil or liquid. The particles may be variously sized, such as micro-droplets, or large or small aerosol particles. In embodiments, the diffuser results in minimal fallout of particles. The diffuser includes at least one of a micro-droplet generator, an atomizer, a nebulizer, a vaporizer, an evaporative wick, a saturated solid, and the like. In an embodiment, the scent diffusion device may include a solid scent medium cartridge that heat energy, such as from a coil, light bulb, candle, heated blower, convective heat source, or the like, to heat the scent medium in the cartridge, while a fan blows through the medium to distribute fragrance. Controlling the fragrance diffusion remotely may involve controlling at least one of the fan or the heat source. In embodiments, such as where a scent diffusion device may include a wick or other fixed or solid medium, diffusion rate/efficiency or wicking rate/efficiency may be adjusted over time or periodically, such as by adjusting an aspect or parameter of the operation of a fan. For example, the amount of liquid available for diffusion may decrease over time as the device operates. In some embodiments, the amount of liquid in the device may decrease at a predictable rate, such as at an exponential rate that can be predicted based on a model, such as a physical or chemical model. As the amount of available liquid decreases in the device, it may become more difficult to induce diffusion of the remaining liquid from the device. This may be due in part to changes in an aspect or parameter of a fixed medium that is used to aid diffusion over time. For example, a wick may dry up, a solid fragrance cake may dehydrate, or the like. By controlling a parameter of a device that is used to promote diffusion, such as the speed of a fan, adjustments may be made to address changes in diffusion characteristics. For example, the fan speed in the diffusion device throughout its operation may be adjusted such that it runs slower when a new cartridge of liquid or other fixed medium is placed in the device, and as a result, the wick or other fixed medium may dry out more slowly. Then, as the device operates and the characteristics of the wick or other solid medium change, the fan may be sped up to obtain a relatively consistent level of diffusion of the liquid from the cartridge or other fixed medium. In some embodiments, the operation of the fan may approximate an elliptoid curve, an exponential curve, or other function suitable to obtain a continuous level of diffusion of the liquid. In embodiments, such as where the liquid is a fragrance oil, controlling the fan to obtain a continuous level of diffusion of the fragrance oil may result in a substantially stable intensity of fragrance over time. In an embodiment, a piezoelectric device may be used in the scent diffusion device to cause a vibration in the package, such as via ultrasonic surface wave effects, or through the use of microscopically perforated vibrating mesh (VMT). Such vibration may cause an oscillating motion and pressure in the liquid within the package and effect atomization of the liquid. The piezoelectric device may be remotely managed to control fragrance levels. Other devices may be used in the system for scent diffusion, such as those including atomizers with hydraulic spray nozzles, liquid-liquid impinging atomizers, air-liquid impinging atomizers, airblast atomizers, prefilming atomizers, high voltage electrospray, and the like. The diffusion device may further include a pump, to enable the venturi effect or otherwise draw the liquid from within the package to enable diffusion, with a controllable duty cycle. The diffusion device may include a fan that aids in distributing the particles. The fan may be low noise, such as by use of a low-noise fan or noise cancelling technology. The diffusion device enables uniform dispersion of vaporized fragrance oil throughout an environment using dispersion technologies that require minimal heat. Such technologies allow fragrance integrity to be sustained over time. In some embodiments, the pump may be a conventional air pump or a speed control air pump. With a conventional air pump, the amount of scent output may be controlled using a duty cycle, such as, for example, a duty cycle of “on” for 2 minutes and “off” for 4 minutes to provide a 33% duty cycle. Given the ability to remotely control pump operation in networked scent diffusion devices, the voltage driving the pump may be increased or decreased remotely, such as in a range of roughly +/−20% from a 10V standard, or from 8 V to 12 V. Controlling the voltage driving the pump enables remote control of the diffusion rate of the device, independent of the voltage range and independent of duty cycle. At a given duty cycle, output can be attenuated or augmented by simply altering the voltage for the pump. For example, for multiple diffusers deployed in an environment, assuming that all of the diffusers are set with the same duty cycle, the voltage driving diffusers deployed in smaller spaces of the environment may be lowered to attenuate output while the voltage driving diffusers deployed in larger spaces of the environment may be raised to augment output. In this example, a duty cycle including an “on” portion of 1 minute at a low speed setting might put out X micrograms per hour, while the same duty cycle portion of “on” for 1 minute at a high speed setting may put out 3× micrograms per hour. Voltage control of the pump enables volumetric control of the device running on a continuous or nearly continuous basis. Referring now to FIG. 22, an embodiment of a diffusion device is depicted. In this view, the housing 2202 contains a pump assembly 2204 that pumps liquid up out of the reservoir(s) through tubes attached to the pump and assembled into fittings 2212. One or more valves, such as solenoid valves 2208, 2210, are placed in line in the tubes to turn pumping on and off. The diffusion device may include a programmable microcontroller module with a memory (fixed or removable) for controlling device functionality, such as control of volume, duty cycle, schedule settings, and the like. The diffusion device may include a wireless local area network module capable of communicating with other devices within a physical location via radio frequency communications including IEEE standards (such as, WiFi, Zigbee, Bluetooth, etc.) Communications protocols that may be used by the diffusion device include one or more of Zigbee, MiFi, MiWi, DMX, ANT, Z-Wave, Insteon, JenNet-IP, X10, mesh network, visible light, ultrasound, infrared light, IP version 6 (IPv6), such as IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN), and the Neighborhood Exchange Protocol. The diffusion devices may form a machine-to-machine network. The diffusion device may include a removable wireless wide area network (WWAN) module capable of electronic communications with one or more remote Network Operations Center(s) via, for example, a telecommunication cellular network. References to a “Network Operations Center” or “NOC” throughout this disclosure should be understood to encompass a single, centralized center, or a set of multiple distributed centers. In embodiments, the diffusion device may include communications technology for wired installations. Telemetry data, such as fragrance-level replenishment alert, may be delivered over the communications network. Device firmware may be upgradable via the network. In an embodiment, on the motherboard of the device, connectors may be adapted to configure the communications module readily or to render the communications module modular, such that it may be swapped in and out readily. For example, the device may be manufactured such that at a distributor, retailer, customer, or other downstream site, a communications module may be installed or swapped. For example, the device may be shipped from the manufacturer to the distributor with a cellular communications module installed, but upon receipt, a need for WiFi- and Bluetooth-enabled devices may emerge. The distributor may be able to open the devices and swap out the cellular communications module for the WiFi-enabled and/or Bluetooth-enabled module. In some examples, the devices may be able to accommodate a plurality of communications protocols such that in this example, the distributor need only to add in the WiFi and Bluetooth modules to the existing cellular module. In other embodiments, the communications module may be embodied with firmware, such that capabilities may be modified by a firmware update, such as delivered over a cellular network via a cellular networking communications protocol, over the Internet or other IP-based network, or the like. In embodiments the communications module may be embodied in or may use a field programmable gate array (FPGA), such that it may be re-programmed in the field to meet changing requirements. The diffusion device may feature “plug and play” ease of installation, with AC or DC power, auto-configuration and NOC “check-in.” Overall, the diffusion device may be light in weight, so the device can hang from a track fixture or wall, such as 5 lbs. per device. The diffusion device may include a manual programming interface (e.g. user interface, screen, button, dial, slider, touch pad, keyboard, or the like) that allows an individual to manually establish and confirm device settings. In embodiments, the diffusion device includes a signal that alerts a user of a device state. The state may relate to a sensed liquid level. The signal may be at least one of a light 1028, a color indicator, a message on a text screen, a sound, and the like. In an embodiment, a scent diffusion device may include a processor that monitors the scent diffusion device and generates a status, and a user interface that provides an alert based on the status, wherein the alert triggers an event. The status may be a clog and the event may be the scheduling of maintenance. The status may be a need for replenishment and the event may be at least one of the scheduling of replenishment and ordering of additional scent. The status may be a tampering and the event may be turning off the device. The status may be at least one of a clog, a need for replenishment, a tampering, an overheating, a loss of power, an operation error, and a damage. The alert may be at least one of a light 1028, a color indicator, a message, a pop-up, a sound, an e-mail, a text message, and an SMS/MMS. In an embodiment, one form of the device may operate as a point-of-use scent disperser, installed within targeted fragrance areas. In an embodiment, another form of the diffusion device may be integrated into the heating/ventilation/air conditioning system of a venue, with fragrance dispersion occurring through the HVAC ductwork or other ventilation system. In an embodiment, the diffusion device may be embodied in the form factor of a flameless LED candle. In an embodiment, the diffusion device may include a tamper-proof closure. The tamper-proof closure may be at least one of a physical key, a software-based key, a biometric key, a retinal scanner, and the like. Physical features of the package may also make it difficult to be tampered with, such as by including at least one of a sonic-welding, a spin welding, a bayonet lock, and the like. On-board sensors may also work as an anti-tampering mechanism if contact with the sensors are lost while power is still sensed or utilized by the device. The package for the diffusion device may include physical features for anti-tampering that prevent the package from operating properly in a device not configured to accept the package. For example, the package may include an RFID tag 1208 for identification and the RFID tag must be read correctly or the diffusion device will not function. Reading the RFID tag may be done on-board the device by an integrated RFID reader or may be done with a separate RFID reader, such as upon installation of the package or during a routine inspection. In another example, the package may include another identification tag, such as a bar code 1204 or QR code 1202, which may be imaged by on-board imaging or a separate imager. The images may be transmitted to the NOC for analysis and approval or storage. In one embodiment, there may be an electrical contact that may need to be made between the package and the device when the package is installed. An electrical feature (not shown) on the package may contact an electrical feature (not shown) on the device, or mating mechanical features (not shown) may be disposed on the package and device. If contact is made, the package contents may be dispensed. If contact is not made, the package contents may not be dispensed and an alert may be sent over the network. An alert may be sent over a network if the package is removed, such as if the package is removed early (e.g. a liquid level sensor indicates sufficient liquid remaining), removed in spite of general instructions (e.g. removed without a work order, removed by a non-technician), and the like. In an aspect, a scent cartridge for a networked scent diffusion device may include a reservoir that holds a liquid and an atomizer head assembly, wherein the atomizer head assembly includes an orifice plate containing a flow restriction orifice for passing compressed gas to be mixed with liquid before passing through an atomizing orifice, and an anti-tampering identifier associated with at least one of the reservoir and the atomizer head assembly, wherein the scent diffusion from the device is based on the condition of the anti-tampering identifier. When the scent diffusion device does not recognize the anti-tampering identifier, an alert may be sent over a network, and scent may not be dispensed. If the cartridge is removed from the device based on the device no longer recognizing the anti-tampering identifier, an alert is sent over a network.

In an embodiment, a scent cartridge for a networked scent diffusion device may include a reservoir that holds a liquid and an atomizer head assembly and an electrical contact disposed on at least one of the reservoir and the atomizer head assembly, wherein when the electrical contact of the scent cartridge makes contact with a corresponding electrical contact of the scent diffusion device, scent is dispensed from the cartridge. When the scent diffusion device does not recognize the anti-tampering identifier, an alert may be sent over a network and the scent may not be dispensed. If the cartridge is removed from the device based on the device no longer recognizing the anti-tampering identifier, an alert may be sent over a network. The atomizer head assembly may include an orifice plate containing a flow restriction orifice for passing compressed gas to be mixed with liquid before passing through an atomizing orifice In an embodiment, a method for securing networked scent diffusion devices may include associating an anti-tampering identifier with a reservoir and an atomizer head assembly of a networked scent diffusion device 2102, determining if the anti-tampering identifier is present on the reservoir or atomizer head assembly 2104, blocking diffusion if the anti-tampering identifier is absent, and communicating the absence of the anti-tampering identifier to other networked scent diffusion devices 2108. In another embodiment, In an embodiment, the method for securing networked scent diffusion devices may include associating an anti-tampering identifier with a reservoir of a networked scent diffusion device, determining if the anti-tampering identifier is present on the reservoir, blocking diffusion if the anti-tampering identifier is absent, and communicating the absence of the anti-tampering identifier to other networked scent diffusion devices. In an embodiment, a diffusion device for atomizing liquids may include at least two reservoirs that hold a liquid, a liquid level sensor disposed in the device, an anti-tampering identifier associated with at least one of the reservoirs and a switch, and a processor, operatively coupled to the liquid level sensor, for generating a first signal indicative of the liquid level, a second signal indicative of the presence of the anti-tampering identifier, and a control instruction for the switch based on the first and second signals to cause the device to switch from utilizing one reservoir in the atomizing diffusion device to utilizing a different reservoir in the atomizing diffusion device. In an embodiment, a method for operating networked scent diffusion devices in an environment to achieve a scent impression goal may include receiving an indication at a networked scent diffusion device that diffusion from one or more other networked scent diffusion devices is blocked due to a tampering indication 2002, accessing an environment model for the environment, wherein the model includes one or more networked scent diffusion devices 2004, and programming a scent diffusion profile for the environment to be executed by one or more of the remaining non-blocked networked scent diffusion devices to achieve the scent impression goal 2008. In certain embodiments, the model includes two or more networked scent diffusion devices. In an embodiment, an atomizing diffusion device may include at least two packages with liquid disposed in the diffusion device, an anti-tampering identifier associated with at least one of the packages, and a processor, operatively coupled to the scent diffusion device, that determines a tampering indication based on the anti-tampering identifier and causes a switch between the packages based on the tampering indication. In an embodiment, the diffusion device may include a chemical sensor in fluid communication with the package for detecting the presence of a specific component in a liquid, such as one disposed within the package. The specific component may be a tracer or tag molecule placed in the package, so that when the tag or tracer is detected, the package is authenticated. Conversely, if the tag or tracer is absent, the package may be identified as potentially fraudulent. In embodiments the chemical sensor may be disposed outside the package, but may be in fluid communication with the contents of the package in order to sample the liquid of the package to determine the presence or absence of the specific tag or tracer component. If the chemical sensor detects the specific component, and thus authenticates the package, the device may proceed to operate to diffuse the liquid as described herein. If the specific component is not detected, various actions may be taken. For example, a visual or audible signal may be generated, such as a flashing light (e.g., an LED) or a beeping sound, or any other visual, auditory, tactile, or other sensor cue that would alert a user or observer of a potential problem, such as cues of various types known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Such a signal may indicate the absence of the specific component, which may be due to tampering, an incorrect package, a depleted package, an error, or the like. In other embodiments, the signal take the form of a message, alert, or communication that is transmitted over a network, such as to a central location, an individual, a manager, a computer, a mobile device, and the like. In certain embodiments, the chemical sensor may sample the air for the specific component, and when the component is not present in the air, the sensor may send an instruction over the network to the diffusion device to cease operation. In embodiments, the package may be embodied in a cartridge, a reservoir, a bag, a balloon, a membrane, and the like. Referring to FIG. 4, a cartridge for a scent management system includes a liquid reservoir 404 and an atomizer head assembly 402, wherein the liquid reservoir is positioned below the atomizer head. The liquid reservoir has a substantially cup shaped geometry, and its top edge is joined to the atomizer head assembly, such as by an ultrasonic weld, a twist lock with o-ring seal, or the like. A conduit or tube 408 for the transportation of the liquid in the reservoir is joined to the atomizer head on its first end, and the second end of the tube extends into the liquid 410 within the reservoir, preferably extending sufficiently below the surface of the liquid to maximize the total volume of liquid drawn from within the reservoir as the liquid within the cartridge is depleted. There may be some condensation, but mostly the excess liquid stays in state and drops back into the reservoir. The atomizer head may have a gas (e.g. air) inlet passage 412 having one end in fluid communication with a compressed air source. The second end of the gas inlet passage may be in fluid communication with an orifice plate 418 containing a flow restriction orifice 420. In certain embodiments, a venturi may be used in place of an orifice plate. The orifice plate separates the gas inlet passage from a mixing chamber 422. The mixing chamber may have a wall opposite the orifice plate, the opposing wall having an atomizing orifice 422. Another wall of the mixing chamber may have an opening 424 in fluid communication with the tube. The atomizing orifice may be in fluid communication with an expansion chamber 428. The expansion chamber may be in fluid communication with a baffle chamber 430. The baffle chamber may have an outlet 432 to the surrounding environment to be treated with the atomized liquid. The operation of the atomizer head may be as follows: Compressed gas flows into the gas inlet passage, through the orifice plate's flow restriction orifice, and into the mixing chamber. This creates a relatively high-pressure region on the gas inlet passage side of the restrictor orifice, and the gas flow velocity out from the restrictor orifice increases and generates a relatively low pressure region on the mixing chamber end of the restrictor orifice. The relative low pressure draws liquid from the reservoir into the mixing chamber through the tube, and the liquid joins the flow path of the gas out of the restrictor orifice creating a mixture of gas and liquid. The gas liquid mixture then passes through the atomizing orifice into the expansion chamber, creating an atomized mixture of liquid and gas. The atomized mixture of liquid and gas flows into the baffle chamber, and the atomized liquid and gas flows through the outlet into the surrounding environment to be treated. As the atomized mixture of liquid and gas flow though the expansion chamber and baffle chamber, it impinges on the surfaces of the chambers and walls separating the chambers. This results in the removal of a substantial portion of the larger particles of atomized liquid from the atomized liquid and gas mixture. The larger particles condense back into liquid and drain back into the reservoir through a weep hole in the partition between the expansion chamber and the reservoir. Also, any liquid not completely atomized after the gas and liquid pass through the atomizing orifice drains back into the reservoir through the weep hole. The baffle chamber also acts as a sound level suppressor, muffling the sound of the gas and atomized liquid flow through the atomizer head assembly. The cartridge is inserted into a diffusion device, with the compressed gas inlet passage coupling with an air fitting 414 to provide the supply of compressed gas to the cartridge. The package may be used in the diffusion devices described herein but also in other scent diffusion devices, such as devices that plug into a wall outlet. In an aspect, a package for use with a scent diffusion device may include a reservoir that holds a liquid and an atomizer head assembly, wherein the reservoir is joined to the atomizer head assembly at a top edge of the reservoir and a tube for the transportation of the liquid in the reservoir, wherein the tube is joined to the atomizer head assembly on a first end while a second end of the tube extends below the surface of the liquid. A gas inlet passage of the atomizer head assembly may have one end in fluid communication with a compressed air source and a second end of the gas inlet passage in fluid communication with an orifice plate comprising a flow restriction orifice. A mixing chamber of the atomizer head assembly may be separated from the gas inlet passage by the orifice plate, the mixing chamber having a first wall opposite the orifice plate comprising an atomizing orifice and a second wall comprising an opening in fluid communication with the tube. An expansion chamber may be in fluid communication with the atomizing orifice and a baffle chamber, the baffle chamber having an outlet to a surrounding environment. A gas flowing into the gas inlet passage through the flow restriction orifice generates a relatively low pressure region in the mixing chamber that causes liquid from the reservoir to be drawn into the mixing chamber through the tube where it joins the flow path of the gas out of the restrictor orifice creating a mixture of gas and liquid which then becomes atomized when it passes through the atomizing orifice. The liquid reservoir may have a substantially cup shaped geometry. The top edge of the reservoir may be joined to the atomizer head assembly by one of an ultrasonic weld and a twist lock with o-ring seal. In embodiments, certain diffusion devices may be capable of dispersing multiple fragrances or other liquids. In embodiments, the networked scent diffusion device may include the capability to accept multiple packages (also known as cartridges or reservoirs) for operation in multiple configurations. The diffusion device may be able to accept a plurality of packages, such as greater than one package. In one example, the diffusion device has two packages. When one package is depleted or near depletion, the diffusion device may switch to diffusion from the second package. In another example, the diffusion device can accept four packages, where two packages house a first scent and the other two packages house a second scent, so that both the first scent and the second scent each have backup packages and the diffusion device can automatically switch to a new package when one becomes empty or is near depletion. In embodiments, the combined volume of liquid in the packages installed in the device may be greater than a percentage of the expected use in a replenishment service cycle. For example, the combined volume of liquid may be more than 50% of the expected use in a service cycle. Switching between packages may be done upon sensing when a package is depleted or near depletion or may be done on some other basis, such as after an elapsed time, if it is day or night, upon detection of a condition, upon detection of a user, and the like. A switching system is described elsewhere herein. In another example, the diffusion device may operate with multiple fragrance packages, and each package may house a different note of a fragrance chord, wherein the diffusion device may be programmed to blend the notes to form the fragrance chord. In embodiments, the fragrance chord may be a particular combination of “base,” “mid-” and/or “high” notes. The fragrance chord may be specified by a brand/media campaign specification. In order to maintain consistent fragrance in an environment where fragrance oil in a reservoir may experience some evaporation or depletion, certain methods may be employed. Fragrance oil is a mixture of numerous liquids, each with different partial pressures. When using atomization, components with higher vapor pressures will flash off earlier, and the heavier components will recycle back into the oil reservoir. The net effect is that as the fragrance oil depletes the fragrance chord, or resultant fragrance, will actually change. One method to potentially influence this effect is to shift the duty cycle of the diffuser device (e.g. increase the t in the duty cycle) as the oil level depletes. Knowing the liquid level, either through sensors, direct measurement or estimation, enables applying the correction factor, t, to preserve the fragrance chord. Another method may involve leveraging a second cartridge. In this scenario, if the main cartridge is partially depleted, adding a small amount of the fragrance oil contained in the second cartridge will add top notes back to the fragrance chord. In an embodiment, as scent oil is depleted over time in a package of a diffuser device with a scent oil recycling feature, the average size of the molecules in the remaining scent oil increases. One statistical explanation is that larger molecules of scent oil are more likely to fall back into the package through the recycling feature during atomization. This change in average molecule size may affect the performance of the diffuser and may result in a lower rate of scent diffusion for a fixed duty cycle setting. A process for adjusting the duty cycle of the diffuser device to compensate for this change in average molecule size and reduced rate of diffusion may include increasing the duty cycle, pump pressure or other diffuser setting which affects rate of diffusion. In one embodiment, a liquid level sensor of the diffusion device may determine the liquid level remaining in the package and a processor of the diffusion device may use the sensed liquid level to modify a diffuser setting as described herein in order to maintain a desired rate of scent diffusion, a target value of a scent, or a brand management goal. A method may include receiving a sensed liquid level in a package of a scent diffusion device, wherein non-atomized scent oil is recycled back into the package during device operation and adjusting the duty cycle of the diffusion device to maintain a desired rate of scent diffusion. Adjusting may include at least one of increasing the duty cycle, increasing the pump pressure, and changing a diffuser setting. In another example, the diffusion device may be capable of accepting multiple packages, and switching between the packages is done in accordance with a time, such as to deliver a day and a night fragrance. In yet another example, the diffusion device is capable of accepting a plurality of packages, wherein one package includes a scent neutralizer and one or more other packages includes a fragrance, such as the diffusion device can switch to the scent neutralizer as needed or in between dispersion of different fragrances. In yet another example, the diffusion device may house multiple packages and the desired package may be selected remotely. For example, when a guest arrives in a lobby of the hotel, they may choose a particular fragrance to diffuse in their hotel room. The fragrance diffusion may be triggered remotely. Continuing with the example, the guest may have chosen the fragrance ahead of time upon booking or sometime prior to arrival, such that the fragrance is triggered when the room becomes available for the guest, when the guest is checked in, when the guest enters the room and is sensed by an occupancy sensor or Bluetooth/WiFi sensor, or the like. In yet another example, the diffusion device may house multiple packages and the liquids in the packages may be blended prior to diffusion. In still another example, one of the packages could be a diluent to reconstitute a concentrated fragrance oil, and the blending could be done at the level of the diffuser. Blending may be programmed to produce a scent concentration factor specified by a brand/media campaign specification. In this example, a plurality of concentrated fragrances may be available in the diffusion device (such as in a carousel), and one or more of the plurality of fragrances can be selected for diffusion. In a further example, the diffusion device may accept a single use package of fragrance, either in addition to the existing dual package configuration or instead of it. For example, a guest in a hotel may be offered various single use packages of fragrance for selection in a lobby that they can install themselves into the diffusion device. In still a further example, the scent in the package may be provided by a crystal, a powder, or another non-liquid element that is reconstituted or diluted prior to diffusion. In embodiments, the fragrance used by the diffusion devices may match scents to be used in passive scent devices, such as candles, tarts, or gels. The fragrance may be delivered as an oil or as a solid, such as a solid crystal. Switching between packages may be done using an automated switching system. An automated switching system for a networked scent diffusion device housing a plurality of fragrance packages enables a switch between packages upon meeting a condition. For example, the condition can be the determination that a level of a fragrance in a package is low. In another example, the switch may be done after an elapsed time in a programmed switchover to mitigate scent desensitization. In embodiments, the device may utilize a FIFO replenishment process. In embodiments, the switching system employs a valve. In embodiments, the switching system employs a liquid level sensor, such as an electrical (e.g. conductive, capacitive transmitters to measure the cumulative capacitance which is a function of the amount of liquid and is based on the liquid's dielectric constant, resistive), magnetic (e.g. Hall effect sensor or Hall effect switch), mechanical (e.g. liquid level float that triggers a switch, physical switch, strain gauge), optical (e.g. imaging sensor, liquid level float plus imaging sensor) liquid level sensor, hydrostatic sensors (e.g. displacers, bubblers, differential pressure transmitter) to measure the pressure of the liquid, load cells to measure the mass in the package, electromagnetic transceivers that transmit an EM signal at the surface of the liquid which reflects back to its receiver with a time delay that is used to calculate the liquid level (EM could be ultrasonic, laser, radar, etc. depending on the wavelength of the EM signal that is sent and received), or any other liquid level sensor. In one embodiment, the liquid level sensor may include a floating magnet disposed within a track inside the package, wherein as the liquid level changes, the floating magnet moves inside the track. At least one Hall effect sensor or Hall effect switch is disposed outside the package, wherein the Hall effect sensor or Hall effect switch is disposed in such a way as to sense the position of the magnet. In an embodiment, when a particular position of the magnet is sensed, which may correspond with a predetermined liquid level, a switch may be activated that causes a move from a first state of the switch to a second state of the switch. The switch may be used to switch the diffusion device's utilization of one package to utilization of another package. For example, the switch may be a solenoid switch between packages. In another embodiment, data from the liquid level sensor may be used to monitor liquid levels inside the one or more packages in the diffusion device and predict when the package(s) will be depleted of liquid. This prediction may be used in scheduling replenishment services so that the diffusion device is never out of liquid. The NOC, a local controller, a gateway device, or any of the devices may perform a days of supply calculation using an algorithm as part of a predictive model to determine when packages in a device will be depleted. The algorithm may utilize measured current liquid level and divide that by the average usage rate per day to determine a number of days of supply remaining. The average usage rate per day may be defined for any time period desired. The result of the calculation may be used to schedule an event, such as a just-in-time replacement of a package, the dispatch of a replenishment technician, or the transmission of an alert/email to on-site personnel. The days of supply calculation may also be done using an estimated liquid level in place of the measured liquid level, wherein the estimate may be determined based on a duty cycle used by the device, optionally in combination with other historical or modeled data regarding device operation. The days of supply calculation may also utilize information such as a duration of operation, a compressed gas usage, and the like in place of the measured liquid level in order to estimate an amount of liquid remaining. In an embodiment, the liquid level sensor for a networked scent diffusion device provides real-time fragrance levels and causes an alert or signal to be generated when the reading from the liquid level sensor indicates a need for replacement of a package, when an unexpected reading is obtained, and the like. In response to receiving the unexpected reading, a control instruction may be sent to the device to turn it off or otherwise cease diffusion operations. If the reading is higher than expected, which may be suggestive of a clog, a control instruction may be sent to the device to switch to a new package. Alerts or signals in this example and throughout this specification may be one or more of visual, audio, electronic (e.g. SMS/MMS, text, email, pop-up, etc.), and the like. Throughout this specification, alerts may be sent asynchronously when the device reports an event, or if a device stops reporting to the NOC for a predetermined period. Throughout this specification, an alert may be triggered whenever a device goes from a non-alert state to an alerted state. If two of the same alerts are reported in a row, the second alert will not cause the device to retrigger a new alert—instead it will consider the alarm still set. Audio alerts may be transmitted through a speaker of the diffusion device. Visual alerts may be transmitted through LED lights of the devices, or the like. In another example, based on the data on the duty cycle and the SCF, a predictive algorithm may be used to estimate the actual liquid level. A single sensor near an empty level of the reservoir may be used to verify liquid level. In an aspect, an atomizing diffusion device may include a floating magnet disposed within a track inside at least one package with liquid for the diffusion device, wherein as a liquid level inside the package changes, the floating magnet moves substantially vertically along the track. The device may further include at least one Hall effect sensor or Hall effect switch disposed outside the liquid at a position to enable sensing the position of the floating magnet in the track. The device may also include a processor, operatively coupled to the Hall effect sensor or Hall effect switch, for generating a signal indicative of the sensed position of the floating magnet and a control instruction for a switch based on the signal and a switch, operatively coupled to the processor, that receives the control instruction from the processor, wherein the control instruction causes the diffusion device to switch from utilizing one package in the diffusion device to utilizing a different package in the diffusion device. The switch may be a solenoid switch. The device of claim may further include a scheduling facility that receives the signal and predicts when the package will be depleted of liquid or determines a package replenishment schedule. The device may further include a remote computer in communication with the processor for receiving the signal and generating an alert if the signal indicates a need for replacement of a package or when an unexpected signal is obtained. The processor may be adapted to send a signal indicating the switch to the different package in the diffusion device In embodiments, the switching system employs a sensor that measures the pressure in the package to determine the presence of a vacuum or a threshold pressure/partial pressure. Certain pressure readings may be associated with a liquid level in the package. When a certain predetermined pressure reading is obtained, it may cause an alert or signal to be generated indicating a need for replacement of a package, an unexpected reading, and the like. In embodiments, the switching system employs a camera or other imaging facility to monitor the liquid level inside the package. For example, the package may have a transparent portion that may allow a camera to image the liquid level. When the camera determines that the liquid level has dropped to a certain point, an alert or signal to be generated indicating a need for replacement of a package, an unexpected reading, and the like. In embodiments, and referring to FIG. 10, an atomizing diffusion system 1000 may include a housing 1002 containing at least two packages 1004 with liquid in fluid communication with at least one diffuser 1008 and a sensor 1010.

The system further includes a processor 1012 operatively coupled to the liquid level sensor for generating a signal indicative of the liquid level and a control instruction for a switch 1014 based on the signal, wherein the switch is operatively coupled to the processor and receives the control instruction from the processor. The control instruction causes the diffusion system to switch from utilizing one package in the diffusion system to utilizing a different package in the diffusion system. In some embodiments of the system, the system switches between a first diffuser 1020 and a second diffuser 1018. In some embodiments of the system, the system switches packages associated with a single diffuser 1008, 1018, 1020. The liquid level sensor may be an imaging sensor, wherein the liquid level inside the package is exposed through at least one of a transparent wall and a transparent window of the package. The switch may be a solenoid switch. The device may further include a communication facility 1022 that enables the processor to transmit the signal to a remote computer, wherein the remote computer uses the signal to generate an alert if the signal indicates a need for replacement of a package or when an unexpected signal is obtained, or predict when the package will be depleted of liquid, or to determine a package replenishment schedule. The liquid level sensor may include a floating magnet disposed within a track inside at least one of the packages, wherein as a liquid level inside the package changes, the floating magnet moves substantially vertically along the track, and at least one of a Hall effect sensor and a Hall effect switch disposed outside the package at a position to enable sensing the position of the floating magnet in the track. The atomizing diffusion device may be a scent diffusion device. In some embodiments, the atomizing diffusion system includes at least two packages with liquid in fluid communication with at least one diffuser, a liquid level sensor that determines the liquid level in at least one of the packages, and a processor, operatively coupled to the liquid level sensor, for generating a signal indicative of the liquid level and a control instruction for altering a state of the diffusion system.

The sensors themselves are on the opposite side of the view of the board 2412 in FIG. 24D. What is seen in FIG. 24D is the board 2412 and the circuit lines running to each of the sensors on the other side.

Predicting may include performing a days of supply calculation. The calculation may involve taking the measured current liquid level and dividing it by the average usage rate per day to determine a number of days of supply remaining. The calculation may involve a duration of operation or a compressed gas usage in place of the measured liquid level in order to estimate an amount of liquid remaining. The average usage rate per day may be defined for a time period. The method may include scheduling a replenishment based on the time. The estimated liquid level may be determined based on a duty cycle used by the device or on historical or modeled data regarding device operation. In an embodiment, a method of coordinating a plan or plans for servicing atomizing diffusion devices, such as scent diffusion devices, within an environment may include disposing a plurality of scent diffusion devices within an environment, wherein each diffusion device includes a communications facility that enables transmitting signals to and receiving signals from a remote computer, disposing at least one liquid level sensor within each diffusion device, receiving at the remote computer, liquid level data from the plurality of diffusion devices; and based on the liquid level data, determining via the remote computer an efficient or optimized plan or plans for servicing the diffusion devices. The plan or plans may involve one or more of: the production of scent fragrance, the procurement of scent fragrance, the management of scent inventory, the delivery of scent inventory, and the scheduling or coordination of resources to accomplish the plan of efficient or optimized servicing of a plurality of devices within an environment. In embodiments, the plan covers servicing atomizing diffusion devices within a plurality of environments. In an aspect, a method relating to atomizing diffusion devices within a plurality of environments may include accessing an electronic data structure characterizing physical parameters of a plurality of remote diffusion devices disposed within a plurality of environments, wherein the electronic data structure includes data specifying at least one of the production of scent fragrance, the procurement of scent fragrance, the management of scent inventory, the delivery of scent inventory, and the scheduling or coordination of resources to accomplish the transformation 1102, accessing at the remote computer, relevant logistical data 1104, and providing a service plan for the diffusion devices based on the electronic data structure and the relevant logistical data 1108. The method may further include accessing, at the remote computer, relevant logistical data at the remote computer, and based on the liquid level and logistical data, determining via the remote computer a plan or plans for servicing the diffusion devices. The logistical data may include at least one of the location of each environment or diffusion device, transportation map data, and route optimization algorithms. The liquid level is measured using an imaging sensor. The liquid level inside a package of the atomizing diffusion device may be exposed through at least one of a transparent wall and a transparent window of the package. The liquid level sensor may include a floating magnet disposed within a track inside at least one of the packages, wherein as a liquid level inside the package changes, the floating magnet moves substantially vertically along the track, and at least one of a Hall effect sensor and a Hall effect switch disposed outside the package at a position to enable sensing the position of the floating magnet in the track. Determining the plan may include performing a days of supply calculation, wherein the calculation involves taking the measured current liquid level and dividing it by the average usage rate per day to determine a number of days of supply remaining, and wherein the average usage rate per day is defined for a time period. Scheduling and coordination of resources may include the dispatch of a replenishment technician or the transmission of an alert/email to on-site personnel. The electronic data structure may be generated at a computer based on liquid level data from the plurality of remote atomizing diffusion devices. Each diffusion device may include a communications facility that enables transmitting signals to and receiving signals from a remote computer and at least one liquid level sensor. The liquid level may be measured using a liquid level sensor including a floating magnet disposed within a track inside at least one package of the atomizing diffusion device, wherein as a liquid level inside the package changes, the floating magnet moves substantially vertically along the track, and at least one of a Hall effect sensor and a Hall effect switch disposed outside the package at a position to enable sensing the position of the floating magnet in the track. The physical parameters may relate to liquid levels of the diffusion devices. In an embodiment, an atomizing diffusion device may include at least two packages with liquid in fluid communication with a scent diffusion device, wherein the liquid level inside the package is exposed through at least one of a transparent wall and a transparent window of the package. At least one imaging sensor may be disposed outside the package in the diffusion device to image the liquid level in the package. A processor may be operatively coupled to the imaging sensor to generate a signal indicative of the liquid level and a control instruction for a switch based on the signal. The switch may be operatively coupled to the processor to receive the control instruction from the processor, wherein the control instruction causes the diffusion device to switch from utilizing one package in the diffusion device to utilizing a different package in the diffusion device. The processor may be adapted to send a signal indicating the switch to the different package in the diffusion device. In embodiments, the liquid level sensor may be used in combination with another measure to determine if the diffusion device is performing correctly. For example, if the liquid level sensor indicates a particular level of liquid inside the package, but the pump activity and/or rate of consumption of compressed air indicates that more liquid should have been depleted, an alert or signal may be generated indicating the unexpected reading. Such an unexpected reading may be caused by a leak in the system or a clogged atomization nozzle or any of many possible malfunctions or performance issues. In an aspect, an atomizing diffusion device may include at least two packages with liquid in fluid communication with a scent diffusion device, wherein a first package contains a neutralizer and a second package contains a scent, a communications facility that receives data from on detected malodors, and a processor, for executing a control instruction based on the data to cause the diffusion device to diffuse at least one of the neutralizer, the scent, and a mixture of the two to counteract the malodor. The data may be derived from environmental sensors. The control instruction may be changing the duty cycle of diffusion of the scent and neutralizer agents. Changing the duty cycle may involve solenoids for each package opening for a certain % of the duty cycle. The data may be derived from a wind direction sensor detecting neighborhood malodors being carried toward a scenting location or a humidity sensor. In an embodiment, the wireless, networked diffusion devices communicate with one another via a networking protocol, wherein the communication between the devices enables generating a consistent scent profile in a wide area. Each diffusion device is capable of operating in several modes, depending on the presence of a WWAN module within the device and its start-up protocol. With a WWAN module installed, the device may auto configure itself in “gateway mode” and may be known as a scent gateway device. With no WWAN module installed, the device may be known as a scent node device. In any event, devices may further include a LAN card. Devices may communicate with one another or may be stand-alone. Alternatively, in some local networking scenarios, devices may be hard-wired to one another and/or to a central networking device. In some embodiments, the devices may transmit and receive communication through a cloud server. In one scenario, a scent dispersion network is established, comprising one scent gateway device and one or more scent node devices, where the scent gateway device and the scent node device may be diffusion devices as described herein. In one embodiment, this may be accomplished in the following manner: 1) the scent gateway device is installed and plugged into AC or DC power; 2) a startup protocol within the scent gateway device includes a self-diagnostic, followed by activation of the WWAN module, and the establishment of communications with the NOC; 3) the scent gateway device then receives configuration settings from the NOC, and begins dispersing scent according to its downloaded programming; 4) upon establishing its own configuration, the scent gateway device searches its wireless local area network for scent node devices; 5) upon identifying scent node devices, the scent gateway device then establishes communications with each scent node device; 6) the scent gateway device gathers information from each scent node device, and then relays that information to the NOC; 7) the NOC receives the device information and communicates program settings and information to each scent node device, via the scent gateway device; 8) each scent node device, having received its configuration settings from the NOC via the scent gateway device, begins dispersing scent according to its downloaded programming. This exemplary scenario provides remote and centralized management of a scent dispersion network via a scent gateway device, which is a scent dispersion device that also acts as the network gateway. Communication between devices may occur via various networking protocols listed elsewhere herein, such as Bluetooth (full power and LE), MiWi, Zigbee, and the like. In embodiments, for a large area, multiple gateway devices may be deployed to establish one or more scent dispersion networks in a location. Once a scent dispersion network is established, the scent gateway device may continue to communicate and store data and instructions to and from each paired or associated scent dispersion device within a venue, and then relays the data and instructions between the NOC and each scent dispersion device. In this manner, the status of the scent dispersion network and each device is regularly communicated to the NOC, and NOC administrators are able to remotely monitor scent dispersion network operations, and control the devices to take actions to ensure fragrance dispersion is conforming to commercial brand standards or other parameters. In one embodiment, the scent dispersion network includes only a scent gateway device in communication with a NOC and no associated or networked scent node devices. The NOC may include a database of all diffusion devices in the field, including information such as device type, location, customer, sensor readings from the diffusion device, a scent diffusion level, fragrance oil volume, fragrance oil type, package/reservoir type, compressed air volume, number of devices in a local network, an on/off status, any alerts, current firmware, permissions and security settings, and the like. Any of the device settings or statuses may be viewed and/or or controlled remotely by a NOC user. The NOC enables running reports in order to check system health and effectiveness at customer locations and generating alerts when diffusion device issues are detected at customer sites. The NOC enables managing cellular wireless provisioning, accounts, usage; remotely managing local mesh wireless networks used to interconnect diffusion devices at a customer site; managing firmware updates in the field; utilizing centralized software applications to gather telemetry data from diffusion devices over the Internet; and the like. A ticketing and workflow facility, described elsewhere herein, for fired alerts may allow NOC users to log responses to the alerts and route tickets to people who can resolve them (e.g., service techs). FIG. 2 depicts an embodiment of a scent management system 200 that enables remote control, monitoring and management of scent devices from a central NOC. In this embodiment, enterprise applications 202 for workflow, analytics, and support as well as consumer apps 204 for mobile and web control may interface with the NOC software 208, which may run in the NOC 118. The enterprise application 202 may run on a NOC user device 114. The consumer apps, such as a customer control app, may run on a consumer control device 120. The NOC software 208 may include features such as virtualized device services, web service APIs, a real-time alert engine, distributed data storage, data rate services, account management, a firmware upgrade manager, secure networks and date, and a scalable cloud architecture. In this embodiment, the NOC 208 communicates via WiFi or a cellular internet gateway with diffusion devices 210 which themselves may be locally networked, such as Zigbee networked. FIG. 3 depicts an embodiment of enterprise architecture 300. In this embodiment, the architecture 300 includes a billing & financials facility 302 that receives billing & payables data from a device management facility 308, an inventory management facility 304 that interfaces with the device management facility 308 for the purposes of exchanging information on new devices, repairs, and replacements, a NOC 118 for monitoring diffusers 102, 104 through the device management facility 308, a ticketing & workflow facility 310 that interfaces with the NOC 118, the device management facility 308, and the service tech interface 314 for creating and managing tickets for service staff, a customer interface 312 for viewing diffuser status and adjusting settings, and a service technician interface 314 to receive service requests and update status, install and service diffusers. For example, system administrators in the NOC are able to, among other things, review status data received from devices within the scent dispersion network, control the program settings of all networked scent devices, identify performance problems within scent dispersion networks, schedule the replenishment of fragrance cartridges, and schedule the maintenance, repair or replacement of malfunctioning networked scent devices. The NOC administrators are able to accomplish such tasks manually by reviewing status data and making changes in real time, or by allowing the NOC software to automatically take action to maintain and support scent dispersion network based on pre-established rules and heuristics. FIG. 6 depicts an exemplary embodiment of a NOC system view 600. In this view, tabs are visible for alerts, devices, information, users, and a search window. An installation sites window lists sites by parent company (e.g. Hotel A, Hotel B, Hotel C), sites that are subsidiary or otherwise associated with the parent (e.g. Hotel A1, Hotel A2), and yet further sites associated the secondary level of the company hierarchy (e.g. Hotel A1—Location 1, Hotel A1—Location 2, Hotel A1—Location 3). In this figure, the user tab is exposed indicating who is a contact point for the installation. FIG. 7 depicts an exemplary embodiment of an overview 700 of diffusion devices at a particular location. In this example, the diffusers are listed, a map with a location of the sites is shown, alerts are shown, and any NOC-specific functions, such as adding a diffuser or gateway, may be shown. For the diffuser listing, information such as a current setting, a current fragrance level, a WiMi signal strength, and a device type may be shown along with any other diffuser or sensor data. Each diffuser may be selected so that the user can drill down on specifics for that diffuser. FIG. 8 depicts an exemplary embodiment of a view of a “drill down” 800 to diffusion device data. Current fragrance level, current setting, a schedule, a fragrance level/FCL (fragrance concentration level)/SCF (scent concentration factor) history, and a temperature history may be shown as well as any other diffuser or sensor data. In an embodiment, a user interface for a network of scent diffusion devices may include a device management & monitoring (DM&M) facility that includes configurable dashboards to enable a plurality of activities for the network of scent diffusion devices, and a security facility to set one or more permissions for the activities. The activities may be at least one of viewing diffusion device telemetry data, maps of diffusion device locations, receiving liquid level readings or other gauge/sensor readings, providing control instructions to diffusion devices, reviewing status of and managing scent operations for one or more networks of scent diffusion devices, receiving data and status information from devices, generating and viewing reports, adjusting device settings, viewing historical graphs showing the performance of the devices, receiving alerts, configuring alert triggers, viewing and editing schedules and scent profiles, viewing unitless parameters for articulating and displaying a fragrance level, reviewing alerts to replace packages, ordering and paying for new packages, renewing subscriptions for scent management services, reviewing system health (e.g. machine down alerts), changing permissions for a user, initiating a ticket/workflow, assigning a service technician, adding or removing a device from a network, and adding a customer/division/store. A mobile application may be used to access the user interface. The user interface may further include a scheduling facility to indicate when a service is scheduled to occur in an environment and allowing a user to select a scent to be diffused in the environment that complements the scheduled service. The alerts may be based on various criteria and configurable conditions (e.g., low liquid, machine down, etc.). Viewing and editing schedules and scent profiles may be done for one or more diffusion devices independently of one another. Adjusting device settings may involve the user increasing or decreasing the overall output of all diffusion devices in the location and allowing a NOC to calculate and adjust the settings for each diffusion device needed to achieve the overall location volume setting. In an aspect, a method of managing scent in an environment may include disposing one or more scent diffusion devices within an environment, wherein the scent diffusion devices comprise a communications facility that enables transmitting signals to and receiving signals from a remote computer, receiving at least one scent parameter for scenting an environment at the remote computer, and controlling, via the remote computer, at least one of the scent diffusion devices to achieve the scent parameter. Controlling may include adjusting an operation parameter of the scent diffusion device in response to a sensed fragrance level in the environment. Referring to FIG. 9, a method for operating atomizing diffusion devices within an environment may include receiving at a computer, liquid level data from a plurality of remote atomizing diffusion devices wherein each diffusion device comprises a communications facility that enables transmitting signals to and receiving signals from a remote computer and at least one liquid level sensor, and based on the liquid level data 902, creating, via the remote computer, an electronic data structure characterizing the transformation of the remote diffusion devices, wherein the electronic data structure includes data specifying at least one of the production of scent fragrance, the procurement of scent fragrance, the management of scent inventory, the delivery of scent inventory 904, and causing the remote atomizing diffusion devices to implement the transformation 908. In another aspect, a method of managing scent in an environment may include disposing one or more scent diffusion devices within an environment, wherein the scent diffusion devices include a communications facility that enables transmitting signals to and receiving signals from a remote computer. The method may further include disposing at least one sensor within the environment that transmits sensor data to the remote computer and receiving at least one scent parameter for scenting the environment at the remote computer. The method further includes controlling, via the remote computer, diffusion of a liquid from a source of the liquid that is in fluid communication with at least one of the scent diffusion devices to achieve the scent parameter. In embodiments, it is not diffusion of a liquid but diffusion of a gas. Controlling may include setting or adjusting an operation parameter of the scent diffusion device in response to the sensor data. The sensor data may relate to static parameters or dynamic parameters, such as room volume, room geometry, room area, airflow, presence of odor-producing materials, presence of odor-sinking factors, lighting, air flow, altitude, traffic flow, occupancy detection (e.g. IR, camera, CO2 sensor), proximity sensing, detected odor, fragrance level, scent concentration factor, temperature, humidity, time of day, season, weather event, detection of a VIP/specific individual entering the space, such as via a smartphone ping, and the like. In certain embodiments, the scent diffusion device(s) may be configured at installation to a baseline configuration, based on the static parameters of the installation site. Then, the device would intelligently adjust output of scent, based on algorithms that adjust for dynamic parameters or time-changing conditions. Certain static parameters include room volume, room geometry, room area, and altitude. With respect to room volume, volume calculations may be performed based on measurements taken of the room, for example, using a tape measure or a laser distance meter, and then adding the volume data into a data structure which characterizes the space in which the diffuser is deployed. This may be done at device installation to establish the baseline settings for the Scent Concentration Factor. With respect to room geometry, geometry may be determined by taking into account entries, exits and other areas of people movement, as well as from floor plans. Room area may be calculated based on sensor measurements of linear distance between walls. With respect to altitude, the diffusion devices may have a proximity detection capability based on cell phone technology, which allows the device to “know” where it is located, for example at a specific longitude and latitude. Given the long-lat information, the networked device can inquire from a remote database the specific altitude of the location where it is located. This altitude information is then used to adjust device performance, so for example, a lower setting of scent diffusion would be used at high elevations with “thinner” air, while a higher level of scent diffusion would be used at lower elevations with “thicker” air. Dynamic parameters include the presence of odor-producing materials, presence of odor-sinking factors, lighting, air flow, traffic flow, occupancy detection (e.g. IR, camera, CO2 sensor), proximity sensing, detected odor, fragrance level, scent concentration factor, temperature, humidity, time of day, season, weather event, detection of a VIP/specific individual entering the space, and the like. With respect to airflow, a sensor technology may measure the mass of air flowing through a device (typically a tube) per unit time. The airflow sensor may be a flow or pressure differential sensor, or switch, or transducer. For a fixed airflow HVAC system, the air flow sensor may be in the form of a switch, which indicates whether air flow is occurring or not, above a certain threshold. That information would be used to turn “on” the scent diffuser when air is flowing, and turn “off” the scent diffuser when air is not flowing. For a variable airflow HVAC system, the airflow sensor may provide an analog voltage reading, which indicates the actual level of air flow. This analog signal may be used to automatically adjust the diffuser output, based on the level of air flow. In such a way, the device is able to increase scent diffusion when air flow is high and lower it when air flow is low (or stop when air flow is “off”) With respect to the presence of odor-producing materials, semiconductor sensors may identify air born scent particles, wherein such sensors may be “tuned” to specific scents. The receptors of these sensors may be able to identify the shape of a scent molecule, or alternatively, are “tuned” to a certain quantum effect of the scent molecules such as its level of vibration. Based on the detection of certain known malodors within an environment, the diffusion device can change its level or scent or conversely can add a secondary odor remediation or neutralization diffusion which counteracts the malodor. In the case of the two-cartridge system, one cartridge contains the desired scent fragrance, while the second cartridge contains the odor remediate/neutralizer, which would be diffused according to a pre-programmed response, once a certain malodor is detected. With respect to the presence of odor-sinking factors, certain types of molecules will interact with or bind to scent particles, causing them to drop out of circulation. These odor-sinking factors can be identified in much the same way as previously described for malodors, allowing the diffusion device to follow a pre-programmed algorithm in response to the presence of the odor sinking factor. With respect to lighting, photodetectors are devices that can sense the presence of photons. There are a variety of well-known and commercially available technologies which enable photo-detection, and some which also are “tuned” to detect and measure the relative amount of certain types of photons, which have characteristic wavelengths (red, blue, etc. in the visible spectrum of lights). The diffusion device has data inputs that enable it to respond to the detection or absence of light, such as, to turn off scent diffusion when no light is detected. Similarly, lighting systems in theatrical productions can be used to control the scent diffusers, so that the networked scent diffuser will follow the programmatic direction of a lighting control system. With respect to traffic flow, people detectors are sensors that can count the number of times a person has walked past a specific point. One detector is a photoelectric sensor, which detects the number of times a beam of light, which is placed across a space, is broken or intercepted by a person walking past. Another detector is an image or video camera, which uses image processing techniques to determine the number of people in a space, as well as their individual dwell times. The diffusion device can take information from a traffic flow sensor and automatically adjust its scent diffusion, for example, by scenting an area as people are arriving, or increasing the scent level to accommodate a larger traffic throughput. With respect to occupancy detection, these sensors can confirm the presence of one or more individuals within a space. One approach includes an image or video camera that uses image processing techniques to determine the number of people in a space, as well as their individual dwell times. The diffusion device can take information related to occupancy and automatically adjust its scent diffusion, for example, by providing more scent to an area with more as people, or stopping scent from diffusion in an unoccupied room and then beginning diffusion of fragrance upon the arrival of people. With respect to proximity sensing, proximity sensors are triggered when a person is directly in front of a particular space, such as in front of a particular product display. By sensing the presence of a person at that space, the diffuser is able to provide a scent experience, coordinated with the presentation of the product in the display. With respect to detection of a VIP/specific individual entering the space, cameras with facial recognition software can determine the presence and identity of an individual or individuals, whose facial profiles have been pre-loaded for comparison. In another embodiment, the VIP/specific individual may be detected via detection of their smartphone. The presence of specific people can therefore be communicated to the device from these sensors, allowing the scent diffusion device to alter its performance. With respect to fragrance level, by “tagging” a desired scent fragrance with a molecular tag, such as a charged particle, a sensor may be able to identify and determine the concentration of the “tagged” scent particles within a space. The diffusion device can be set to deliver a certain level of scent concentration within an environment, and using odor detection of the scent particles which the diffuser is dispensing, can ensure a defined range of acceptable scent level, or “scent concentration factor” or SCF. When the sensor detects odor concentrations below the desired SCF, then the diffuser delivers additional fragrance to achieve the desired concentration. If the measured concentration is within the defined SCF, then the diffuser continues monitoring without diffusion. If the concentration is above the SCF, the diffuser can continue monitoring without diffusion, or can diffuse an odor sinking formulation which binds with airborne scent and thereby reduces the scent level to within the desired SCF range. With respect to temperature, the scent diffuser may have multiple ways of measuring temperature. Internal temperature within the diffusion device is measured using a thermistor that is present in the electronics of the device. This thermistor allows the device to communicate the internal temperature to a remote monitoring center, which can be alerted if internal temperature exceeds a prescribed threshold such as its recommended operating range of temperature. Similarly, with remote monitoring, the device can be pre-programmed to take certain action under certain temperature condition, such as, stop dispensing fragrance oil if the temperature is above its operating threshold, or below the freezing point of the scent oil. External temperature may be measured based a thermal sensor (thermistor) mounted on the exterior of the device, allowing the diffuser to alter its performance based on changing temperatures within the environment which is being. The temperature of the exterior climate can be retrieved from a remote data structure, based on the geo-code location of the device using its network connectivity. The diffuser can react to the exterior temperature of the environment, by diffusing alternate fragrances, or by altering the scent concentration. With all three forms of temperature measurement and tracking data across diffusers using the remote monitoring capability of the devices, one can determine the statistical correlation of temperature to other performance trends, for example, oil consumption rate over time. With respect to humidity, a humidity sensor installed within a device can detect internal device humidity, one on the exterior of the device can determine environmental humidity within the space being fragranced, and geocode and remote data lookups can be used to retrieve the humidity of the local climate. The scent device can react to changes in these humidity levels similarly as described for temperature. Similarly, over time, remote monitoring can be used to evaluate and correlate trend data, such as how humidity affects the consumption rate of scent oil within a diffuser. With respect to time of day, the diffusers are smart, connected devices, and consequently, accurately know the time. Based on the geolocation data from the cell phone modem (or network id) of a diffuser in a the scented environment, the device can accurately set its clock to the correct local time zone, and automatically adjust for seasonal adjustments in time, with the goal of keeping the diffuser unit in time-sync with the world clock. Since the scent diffuser devices have the ability to change fragrance output or fragrance type based on scent programs or play lists, it is critical that the device has an accurate representation of its current time. With respect to season, the diffuser has the ability to accurately tell time as well as know the current day, week and year, using the same approach as described above. Using this knowledge of time, it can be programmed for different performance on different days or in different seasons of the year. With respect to a weather event, since the diffuser is smart and connected, local weather conditions can be downloaded to the device based on its geolocation. Based on these local weather conditions, the diffusing device can alter its performance based on a predefined set of rules. The scent diffusion device may include at least one package containing a fragrance oil or at least two packages containing a fragrance oil. In embodiment, one of the scent diffusion devices is a master node and the other of the scent diffusion devices are slave nodes and receive control instructions from the computer through the master node. In this embodiment, each scent diffusion device can adjust its own control settings based on the activities of the other scent diffusion devices. The method may include configuring the scent diffusion devices so that a device duty cycle for one of scent diffusion devices does or does not occur simultaneously within proximity to another one of the scent diffusion devices. The scent parameter may relate to a brand management goal. The method may further include determining the total number of scent diffusion devices to dispose in the environment based on a room volume. The method may further include determining one or more locations to dispose the scent diffusion devices in the environment based on a room volume. The operation parameter may include at least one of a flow rate of the liquid, a duration of flow of the liquid, a variation in the flow rate of the liquid, an on/off status of the diffusion device, a package from which to diffuse the liquid, a switch to a different package from which to diffuse the liquid, and the like. In another exemplary use scenario, the scent dispersion network includes one or more scent node devices and a wide-area network gateway device. In this scenario, the network gateway device performs the communication and control functions of the scent gateway device, without actually dispersing fragrance. In this scenario, system administrators in the NOC control the program settings of all networked scent devices, and ensure fragrance dispersion is conforming to commercial brand standards or other parameters. This scenario provides remote and centralized management of a scent dispersion network via a network gateway device that does not dispense fragrance. In an aspect, a method of managing scent in an environment may include disposing one or more scent diffusion devices within an environment, wherein the diffusion devices comprise a communications facility that enables transmitting signals to and receiving signals from a non-fragrance dispensing, wide-area network gateway device. The method may further include networking the network gateway device to the scent diffusion devices, wherein the network gateway device receives communication and control functions from a remote computer for distribution to the scent diffusion devices. At least one sensor disposed within the environment may transmit sensor data to the remote computer. At least one target value of a scent parameter for an environment may be received at the remote computer. The method may further include controlling, via the remote computer, diffusion of a liquid, from a source of the liquid in fluid communication with at least one of the scent diffusion devices, to achieve the target value of the scent parameter, wherein controlling includes setting or adjusting an operation parameter of one or more of the scent diffusion devices based on the sensor data. In embodiments, it is not diffusion of a liquid but diffusion of a gas. At least one of the scent diffusion devices receives control instructions from the remote computer and relays control instructions to at least one other scent diffusion device. The scent diffusion devices may relay control instructions in series, in a ring, in a mesh, in a star networking topology, and the like. In another exemplary use scenario, the scent dispersion network includes one or more scent node devices, a local area network control device, but without a wide-area network gateway device. Each scent node device is paired with a local area network control device, which enables a local user within a venue to program and control the scent node devices independently of a NOC (local control, versus centralized remote control). This scenario enables local management of a scent dispersion network via wireless local area network communication protocols. Examples of local area network control devices include a computer or laptop with wireless local area network communication capability; a smart phone, pad device, or tablet computer with wireless local area network communication capability; or a purpose built scent controller device with wireless local area network communication capability. In embodiments, the scent controller device may be a handheld or wall-mounted device for controlling one or more networked scent diffuser devices. In an embodiment, a method of managing scent in an environment, may include disposing at least one scent diffusion device within an environment, wherein the at least one scent diffusion device comprises a communications facility that enables transmitting signals to and receiving signals from a standalone remote control device, receiving at least one target value of a scent parameter for the environment at the standalone remote control device, and based on the target value, controlling, via the standalone remote control device, diffusion of a liquid from a source of the liquid in fluid communication with the at least one scent diffusion device to achieve the target value of the scent parameter. In embodiments, it is not diffusion of a liquid but diffusion of a gas. In an aspect, a method of managing scent in an environment may include disposing one or more scent diffusion devices within an environment, wherein the diffusion devices comprise a communications facility that enables transmitting signals to and receiving signals from a local area network control device and networking the local area network control device to each of the scent diffusion devices, wherein the local area network control device receives communications from and distributes control instructions to the scent diffusion devices. The method may further include disposing at least one sensor within the environment that transmits sensor data to the local area network control device, receiving at least one scent parameter for scenting an environment at the local area network control device, and controlling, via the local area network control device, the diffusion of a liquid or gas, from a source of the liquid in fluid communication with at least one of the scent diffusion devices, to achieve the scent parameter, wherein controlling includes setting or adjusting an operation parameter of one or more of the scent diffusion devices in response to the sensor data. The local area network control device may include one or more of a computer or laptop with wireless local area network communication capability, a smart phone, a pad device or tablet computer with wireless local area network communication capability, a purpose built scent controller device with wireless local area network communication capability, a handheld device, a wall-mounted device, and the like. In yet another exemplary use scenario, the scent dispersion system includes one or more scent node devices, with no wide-area network gateway device and no local area network control device. This scenario provides for the stand-alone operation of a scent node device using manual settings, established by a local individual using the user interface found on each fragrance dispersion device. In embodiments, multiple master devices may be deployed at a single physical location. In embodiment of multi-device installs (master-slave configuration), each device can adjust its own control settings based on the activities of the other devices. The system may be a coordinated network of devices with “local scent network” level control mechanisms versus device stand-alone control mechanisms. For example, a group of meshed dispensers could be configured so that individual device duty cycles do not occur simultaneously within proximity to one another (one device waits for the previous one to dispense, so they do not end up overloading an area with multiple scent devices “firing” at the same time). Of course, they may also be configured to fire simultaneously. In effect, coordination, sequencing, and/or synchronization of meshed scent devices is controlled dynamically. In an embodiment, the number and location of scent diffusion devices within an enclosed space may be established based on the volume of the space but the individual control programs for those devices may be based on something other than the volume of the space, such as a sensor reading, an area, a linear distance from the device to a target, and the like. In embodiments, the initial settings for the diffusion devices may be established in one manner, such as by using room volume, but then may switch over to control via a different mechanism, such as by environmental adjustments or rate of consumption measurements, and the like. In an embodiment, the diffusion devices may operate in a scent-casting mode, wherein the devices are programmed with a linear distance to a scent target location and the level of fragrance that should be at that target location. Further considerations may include airflow and tonnage of an HVAC system when programming a scent-casting mode. In a scent-casting mode, the goal is not to fill the space with fragrance, but rather scent a targeted area or audience with the scent brand impression. In an aspect, a method of scent casting in an environment may include disposing a scent diffusion device within an environment, wherein the scent diffusion device comprises a communications facility that enables transmitting signals to and receiving signals from a remote computer, determining a distance from the scent diffusion device to a scent target location, receiving, at the remote computer, at least one scent parameter for the scent target location, and controlling, via the remote computer, the scent diffusion device to achieve the scent parameter, wherein controlling includes setting an operation parameter of the scent diffusion device based on the determined distance and the scent parameter. The method may further include disposing at least one sensor within the environment that transmits sensor data to the remote computer, and adjusting an operation parameter of the scent diffusion device in response to the sensor data. The sensor data may relate to at least one of room volume, room geometry, room area, airflow, presence of odor-producing materials, presence of odor-sinking factors, lighting, air flow, altitude, traffic flow, occupancy detection (IR, camera, CO2 sensor), proximity sensing, detected odor, fragrance level, temperature, humidity, time of day, season, weather event, and detection of a VIP/specific individual entering the space (via smartphone ping or the like). The method may further include adjusting an operation parameter of the scent diffusion device in response to an HVAC tonnage. Scent casting in an environment may be accomplished using a network of diffusion devices, such as scent diffusion devices. A network of diffusion devices may be disposed within an environment that each includes a communications facility enabling that transmission of signals to and the reception of signals from a remote computer. One such received signal may be a scent parameter for a scent target location. A distance from the diffusion devices to the scent target location may be determined by any means available for such determination. Via the remote computer, the network of diffusion devices may be controlled to achieve the scent parameter. Controlling may include setting an operation parameter of the diffusion devices based on the determined distance and the scent parameter. Scent casting may also be implemented using a hotspot in an environment. Such a diffusion device may include a sensor to determine a distance from the diffusion device to a scent target location and a first communications facility 1022 that receives control signals from a network operations center, the control signals for controlling a scent diffusion from the diffusion device in accordance with a scent impression goal and the distance. The device may also include a second communications facility 1024 to communicate data with a mobile device at the scent target location for consumer engagement, such as to provide consumers with a coupon, an ad, a survey, a game, or other content. A ticketing & workflow facility of the NOC may receive alerts from the device management and monitoring system and create tickets. Tickets may be routed, based on rules, to the correct person, or in some cases, rules might automatically trigger some action (e.g., shut down a device that is misbehaving, or reboot a device). The ticketing & workflow facility may be a configured version of a commercial service ticketing system. Managed, networked diffusion devices, where the device is agnostic to the actual diffusion technology, may be used for generating a consistent scent profile in a wide area/ambient environment in accordance with brand standards or other parameters. In an embodiment, generating the consistent scent profile involves consistently neutralizing a malodor in an environment. Generating a consistent scent profile may include management of duty cycle, schedule, fragrance level/fragrance replenishment, room volume, room geometry, airflow, presence of odor-producing materials, presence of odor-sinking factors, lighting, temperature, humidity, altitude, traffic flow, occupancy, time of day, inventory of particular “base,” “mid-” and “high” notes in a fragrance chord and other variables relating to the environment. As such, data collected by or about the device, data based on measurements by sensors on or associated with the device, and data from users may be transmitted to, generated, or used by the NOC in order to facilitate management. These data will be described herein. Certain data types may be sent from the diffusion devices to the NOC or other user. Data regarding a work schedule, such as duty cycle, day parts, and the like, may be sent by the diffuser. Object type, such as the type of diffuser (e.g. Master, Slave, standalone), may be transmitted by the diffuser. The diffusion device may transmit the fragrance name(s) and level(s). For example, the fragrance level may be a value from 0 to 100, with 100 being full and 0 being empty. The temperature, in Fahrenheit, Celsius or other units, as well as date and time may be transmitted. The diffusion device may send an indication of the strength of the local wireless link. An array of any error codes that are currently present on the device may be transmitted. The diffusion device may transmit the average pump pressure. The diffusion device may report diagnostic data on a periodic basis, such as weekly/daily, or by forcing the diffusion device into a diagnostic mode, such as via a local keypad or controller, or from the NOC. Data usage may be reported by Master devices, such as cellular data usage. In an embodiment, a device management & monitoring (DM&M) facility may be embodied in a user interface that may include configurable dashboards to enable activities, such as viewing diffusion device telemetry data, viewing maps of diffusion device locations, receiving liquid level readings or other gauge/sensor readings, providing control instructions to diffusion devices, review status of and manage scent operations for one or more networks of scent diffusion devices, receive data from devices, receive alerts, view/edit schedules and scent profiles, view unitless parameter for articulating and displaying a fragrance level, review alerts to replace packages, order new packages and pay on-line, renew subscriptions for scent management services, review system health (e.g. machine down alerts), change permissions for a user, initiate a ticket/workflow, assign a service technician, add/remove device from a network, add customer/division/store, and the like. In embodiments, a mobile application, such as a smartphone or tablet application, may allow customers to access a mobile version of the user interface. The user interface may be used to set up and trigger alerts based on various criteria and configurable conditions (e.g., low liquid, machine down, etc.), wherein the NOC may manage the system by exception based on detected alarms. The user interface may allow customers to view the status of their diffusion devices, adjust their settings, or view historical graphs showing the performance of the devices. The user interface may take data from DM&M and present it in a way that uses the language of fragrance, rather than of devices (e.g., MAC Address, PAN number). In embodiments, the DM&M facility may be responsible for all communication with diffusion devices and may be the only module that can change diffusion device settings. In other embodiments, WiFi capabilities may be included in the master diffusion device enabling a direct connection to the device. The user interface may be used to manage and edit the schedules for one or more diffusion devices independently of one another. That is, there is the ability for different diffusers at a single site to have different schedules. A reports page may be used to generate and access reports. An “about page” or introductory page may tell the user about the version number of the application, as well as the version number and device types of the various devices. The user interface may include a login screen for entering the user's User ID and password and authenticating it. The user interface may include a dashboard page that shows the status of all local diffusion devices at a summary level. A visual icon representing each diffusion device with an indicator for function or status may be included in the dashboard. The user interface may include a diffusion device page that includes a list of diffusion devices at the location, with summary status and settings (e.g., volume setting, overall diffusion device health, whether it's currently diffusing or not based on duty cycle, status of communications links, and the like). Icons for each diffusion device may be presented. A diffusion device status page may be a drill-down page that shows all device status data and settings, such as overall diffuser health (good, or error+error code and description), diffuser volume/output-level setting (according to program), diffuser volume/output-level setting (according to setting by local customer, possibly overriding the program), liquid fragrance level (based on the sensor reading), time and date according to device clock, health of communication links between various devices and the local server, which fragrance is playing/being diffused in the diffuser, date and time of last service, and the like. An edit diffusion device settings page may be a page where a user can edit a diffusion device's settings and save the new settings, including the on/off program settings, and the fragrance volume level. A location control page may allow the user to increase or decrease the overall output of all diffusion devices in the location. For example, an algorithm, such as a location control algorithm, may execute a calculation that translates a targeted fragrance value (also known as a local output level) (e.g., between 0-100, between 0-10, etc.) in the location to actual device settings for each diffusion device. The user would adjust only the overall location volume setting, not the settings for each diffusion device. The NOC would then calculate and adjust the settings for each diffusion device needed to achieve the overall location volume setting. The local output level represents the output level aggregated across all diffusers. The user interface may present graphical arrows for moving the output level up or down. The master diffusion device may adjust its own output level and the output level of its slaves upward or downward, proportionately based on the new setting. If all diffuser settings were the same, the new settings will all be the same, but if the diffusers had different output settings, the new settings may be scaled based on each diffuser's original setting. As an example, the current output level might be 70, based on 3 diffusers whose output settings are 65, 70, and 75. If the user moves the output level to 80, the new settings may be the original settings multiplied by (80-70)/70, resulting in settings of 74.28, 80, 85.71, respectively. The above calculations may be done by customer web services or the NOC and pushed to the individual diffusers. The location control algorithm may include feedback from one or more sensors in the environment or onboard the diffusion device in making the calculations, such as feedback from a Bluetooth/WiFi sensor (e.g. to determine an occupancy), a different occupancy sensor, an altitude sensor, an airflow sensor, a humidity sensor, a light sensor, a motion/occupancy/proximity sensor, a laser distance measure/digital laser rangefinder, a particle sensor, an olfaction sensor/VOC sensor, an imaging sensor/cameras, a scent concentration factor sensor, a clock, a timer, a calendar, a weather sensor, and the like. Modification or generation of a scent profile delivered by a network of scent diffuser devices may be based on one or more sensed parameters, wherein modifying the scent profile is done by selection of or adjustment of the diffusion settings for one or more available fragrances onboard one or more networked scent diffuser devices. The sensed parameter may be at least one of room volume, room geometry, airflow, presence of odor-producing materials, presence of odor-sinking factors, lighting, air flow, altitude, traffic flow, occupancy detection (IR, camera, CO2 sensor), proximity sensing, detected odor, fragrance level, temperature, humidity, time of day, season, weather event, detection of a VIP/specific individual entering the space (via smartphone ping or the like), and the like. In embodiments, the scent profile is a neutralization of a malodor and the fragrance includes an odor neutralizer. Modification or generation of a scent profile delivered by a network of scent diffuser devices may be based on feedback from automated air sampling, wherein modifying is by selection of or adjustment of the diffusion settings for one or more of a plurality of available scent modifiers onboard one or more networked scent diffuser devices. A user may adjust an overall level of fragrance desired in the space and the NOC or the master diffuser device may determine the adjustment required for the one or more devices, such as slave diffuser devices. A master diffuser device may adjust its own output level and the output level of its slaves upward or downward, proportionately based on the new setting. In an embodiment, the automated air sampling may be automated malodor sampling and identification, the scent profile may be a neutralization of a malodor and the scent modifier is a neutralizer or fragrance. Adjusting the settings may include selection of a best-fit neutralization/fragrance for dealing with the malodor and determination & execution of a dispersal profile for the neutralizer/fragrance that is needed to neutralize or counteract the malodor. In an embodiment, a method may include disposing at least one sensor within the environment that transmits sensor data to a remote computer, receiving at least one target value of a scent parameter for the environment at the remote computer, and based on the sensor data, controlling, via the remote computer, diffusion of a scent from at least one scent diffusion device to achieve the target value of the scent parameter, wherein controlling includes setting or adjusting an operation parameter of the at least one scent diffusion device in response to the sensor data. In an aspect, a method may include receiving at least one remotely sensed scent parameter for an environment at a remote computer 1402, and based on the sensed scent parameter data, controlling, via the remote computer, diffusion of a scent from at least one scent diffusion device in the environment to achieve a target value of the scent parameter, wherein controlling includes at least one of setting and adjusting an operation parameter of the at least one scent diffusion device in response to the sensed scent parameter data 1404. The sensed parameter may relate to at least one of room volume, room geometry, room area, airflow, presence of odor-producing materials, presence of odor-sinking factors, lighting, air flow, altitude, traffic flow, occupancy detection (IR, camera, CO2 sensor), proximity sensing, detected odor, fragrance level, temperature, humidity, time of day, season, weather event, and detection of a VIP/specific individual entering the space (via smartphone ping or the like). The scent diffusion device may include at least one package containing fragrance oil or at least two packages containing fragrance oil. One scent diffusion device may be a master node and the other scent diffusion devices may be slave nodes and control instructions are sent from the remote computer through the master node. At least one of the scent diffusion devices receives control instructions from the remote computer and relays control instructions to at least one other scent diffusion device. In this scenario, the scent diffusion devices may relay control instructions in series, in a ring, in a mesh, in a star networking topology, or the like. Each scent diffusion device may adjust its own control settings based on the activities of the other scent diffusion devices. The method may further include configuring the at least one scent diffusion device so that a device duty cycle does or does not occur simultaneously within proximity to another scent diffusion device. The scent parameter may relate to a brand management goal. The method may further include determining the total number of scent diffusion devices to dispose in the environment based on a room volume. The method may further include determining one or more locations to dispose the scent diffusion devices in the environment based on a room volume. The operation parameter may include at least one of a flow rate of the liquid, a duration of flow of the liquid, a variation in the flow rate of the liquid, an on/off status of the diffusion device, a package from which to diffuse the liquid, and a switch to a different package from which to diffuse the liquid. In an embodiment, a method may include sampling the air in an environment to determine the presence of a malodor according to an automated sampling program, selecting at least one of a neutralizer and a fragrance for a network of scent diffusion devices to diffuse to counter the malodor, and adjusting an operation parameter of the network of scent diffusion devices in response to the malodor to diffuse the selected neutralizer or fragrance. Determining may involve measuring an electrostatic charge. A user may adjust an overall level of odor desired in the space and a scent diffusion device controller may determine the adjustment required for the one or more devices. Adjusting may involve a master diffusion unit of the network of scent diffusion devices adjusting its own output level and the output level of its slaves upward or downward, proportionately based on the adjusted operation parameter. The method may further include repeating the step of sampling to determine the continued presence of the malodor, and terminating the operation of the network of scent diffusion devices if the malodor is no longer present. Adjusting may involve altering a duty cycle of the scent diffusion device. The method may further include selecting both of the neutralizer and the fragrance; and selecting a mix ratio for the two. In an aspect, a method may include sampling the air in an environment to determine the presence of a malodor according to an automated sampling program, selecting at least one of a neutralizer and a fragrance for a scent diffusion device to diffuse to counter the malodor, adjusting an operation parameter of the scent diffusion device in response to the malodor to diffuse the selected neutralizer or fragrance, and communicating the adjustment to other scent diffusion devices in a network of scent diffusion devices. Determining may include measuring an electrostatic charge. Adjusting may include a master diffusion unit of the network of scent diffusion devices adjusting its own output level and the output level of its slaves upward or downward, proportionately based on the adjusted operation parameter. The method may further include repeating the step of sampling to determine the continued presence of the malodor, and terminating the operation of the network of scent diffusion devices if the malodor is no longer present. Adjusting may include altering a duty cycle of the scent diffusion device. The method may further include selecting both of the neutralizer and the fragrance; and selecting a mix ratio for the two. In an embodiment, a sensor may be used to meter the environment for fragrance levels to provide feedback to a network of scent diffusion devices in order to continue generating a consistent scent profile in a wide area. In embodiments, this feedback enables the scent management system to operate in a closed loop. The sensor may be one or more of a particle sensor, olfaction sensor/VOC sensor, a scent concentration factor (SCF) sensor, a sensor that measures a proxy/tag dispersed with the fragrance, a sensor that measures an electrostatic charge, and the like. For example, a scent may be mixed with a tracer for diffusion into a space via one or more networked scent diffuser devices, wherein the tracer can be tracked throughout a wide area. Tracking may be used to confirm a fragrance in use, confirm that a fragrance is reaching its intended target, to determine the path of an individual who was initially in the space by detecting the tracer outside of the fragranced area, and the like. Various taggants may be used, such as odorless taggants. One taggant may be a perfluorocarbon tracer, such as taggants described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,409,839. In an aspect, a method may include sampling the air in an environment to determine a fragrance level according to an automated sampling program, providing the fragrance level as feedback to a network of scent diffusion devices, and adjusting an operation parameter of the scent diffusion devices in response to the feedback, wherein adjusting enables the continued generation of a consistent scent profile in the environment. Determining may involve measuring a proxy/tag dispersed with the fragrance or an electrostatic charge. Adjusting may be by selection/adjustment of one or more of a plurality of available scent modifiers onboard one or more networked scent diffusion devices.
