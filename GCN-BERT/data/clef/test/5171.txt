TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a novel compound having GPR40 receptor agonist activity that promotes insulin secretion and inhibits blood sugar rise after glucose loading, and is thereby useful for the treatment of diabetes and complications thereof, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts and isomers thereof, and the pharmaceutical compositions containing them. BACKGROUND ART Diabetes negatively impacts many people's health and induces various complications. Diabetes is divided into type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is presented when insulin is not produced due to destruction of pancreatic cells. Type 2 is presented when insulin is not produced for other reasons or the body is not responding to insulin. Type 2 diabetes is found in 90% or more of diabetic patients. Sulfonylureas (promoting insulin secretion from pancreatic cells), biguanide (suppressing glucose production in the liver), a-glucosidase inhibitor (inhibiting glucose absorption in the intestines), thiazolidine derivatives (TZDs) and the like are currently used for the treatment of diabetes. Incretin-related drugs such as DPPIV inhibitors or Exenatide have recently entered the market. However, these agents have unwanted side effects such as hypoglycemia, liver failure, gastrointestinal disorders and weight gain, or weak hypoglycemic function or the disadvantage that they must be used as an injection. Therefore, research has been conducted for new therapies based on a new mechanism that is able to avoid the drawbacks and side effects of existing diabetes therapies. Recently, an insulinotropic mechanism by free fatty acid was revealed more clearly through the study of GPR40 which is a G-protein-coupled receptor. GPR40 receptor is highly expressed in the pancreas, and it has been found that ligands for GPR40 receptor are saturated free fatty acids having 12-16 carbon atoms and unsaturated fatty acids having 18-22 carbon atoms. And it is confirmed that long-chain FFAs activate GPR40 receptor depending on blood glucose concentration, thereby stimulating insulin secretion from the beta cells of the pancreas via experiments that selectively inhibit the expression of GPR40 receptor in the pancreas using siRNA (small interfering RNA) technology and that measure how insulin secretion by blood glucose changes from beta cells of the pancreas in the presence of free fatty acids. Accordingly, GPR40 agonists have a blood glucose concentration-dependent insulin-secretion stimulating activity, and thus are useful for the treatment and prevention of diabetes and complications thereof.

In addition, the present invention provides a method for preparing the composition for preventing or treating diabetes and/or complications of diabetes which comprises the step of mixing the compound of Formula (1), a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or isomer thereof as an active component and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. According to the present invention, the “pharmaceutical composition” can include other chemical components such as carriers, diluents, etc., in addition to the active component of the present invention. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical composition can include pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, excipients or combinations thereof as necessary. The pharmaceutical composition facilitates the administration of compounds into the body. Various methods for administering the compounds include, but are not limited to, oral, injection, aerosol, parenteral and local administration. Herein, the term “carriers” means compounds that facilitate the addition of compounds into the cell or tissue. For example, dimethylsulfoxide is a conventional carrier facilitating the administration of various organic compounds into the living cell or tissue. Herein, the term “diluents” means compounds that not only stabilize a biologically active form but are also diluted in solvent dissolving the compounds. Dissolved salts in buffer are used as diluents in this field. A conventionally used buffer is a phosphate buffer saline that copies salt form in bodily fluid. Since buffer solution can control the pH of the solution at low concentration, buffer diluents hardly modify the biological activity of compounds. Herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means such property that does not impair the biological activity and physical property of compounds. The compounds according to the present invention can be formulated as various pharmaceutically administered dosage forms. In the preparation of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, an active component—specifically, the compound of Formula (1), a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or isomer thereof—is mixed with selected pharmaceutically acceptable carriers considering the dosage form to be prepared. For example, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be formulated as injections, oral preparations and the like, as needed. The compounds of the present invention can be formulated by conventional methods using known pharmaceutical carriers and excipients, and inserted into a unit or multi-unit containers. The formulations may be solution, suspension or emulsion in oil or aqueous solvent and include conventional dispersing agents, suspending agents or stabilizing agents. In addition, the formulation may be, for example, dry powder form which is dissolved in sterilized pyrogen-free water before use. The compounds of the present invention can be formulated into suppositories by using a conventional suppository base such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. Solid forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders and granules. Capsules and tablets are preferred. Tablets and pills are preferably enteric-coated. Solid forms are manufactured by mixing the compounds of the present invention with at least one carrier selected from inert diluents such as sucrose, lactose or starch, lubricants such as magnesium stearate, disintegrating agents, binders and the like. The compounds according to the present invention and the composition comprising them can be administered in combination with other drugs—for example, other antidiabetics, as required. The dose of the compounds of Formula (1) is determined by a physician's prescription considering the patient's body weight, age and disease condition. A typical dose for adults is in the range of about 1 to 500 mg per day according to the frequency and intensity of administration. A typical daily dose of intramuscular or intravenous administration for adults is in the range of about 1 to 300 mg per day which can be administered in divided unit dosage. Some patients need a higher daily dose. Herein, the term “treatment” is used to mean deterring, delaying or ameliorating the progress of diseases in a subject exhibiting symptoms of diseases. The term “prevention” is used to mean deterring, delaying or ameliorating the sign of diseases in a subject at risk of exhibiting symptoms of diseases, even if he or she does not exhibit the symptoms. MODE FOR THE INVENTION The present invention is explained in more detail by the following Examples. However, the scope of the present invention is not limited by them. When preparing the compounds of the present invention, it is possible to appropriately change the reaction sequence. That is, it is possible to run first optional processes or insert optional processes to change substituents, and use any reagents other than exemplified reagents as needed. Compounds obtained in each process can be separated or purified by conventional methods such as recrystallization, distillation or silica gel column. Furthermore, the compound obtained in each process can be used in the next step without further purification or separation. Reagents and starting materials can be obtained readily commercially. Others can be produced by synthetic methods described in the following Examples, including known synthetic methods for structurally similar compounds. Unless otherwise noted, compounds used as starting materials are known ones or those which can be prepared by known synthetic methods or similar methods from known compounds.

(2) Preparation of Cell-Culture Medium and Cell Culture The cell line was cultured in cell-culture medium (F-12 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum; Invitrogen), 0.5 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) and 1% (v/v) Antibiotic-Antimycotic solution (Invitrogen)) under the condition of 5% CO2 and 37° C. For calcium flux assay, the cells were diluted with the cell-culture medium to a concentration of 5×105 cells/ml, and the diluted cell suspension was dispensed in amount of 100 μl/well to a 96-well transparent bottom black polystyrene cell culture plate (Corning) and then cultured for 24 hours. The following concentrations of test compounds were added to these cells, and then the changes in intracellular calcium concentration were measured by FlexStation 11384 (Molecular Devices). The following solution was prepared before the measurement. (3) Preparation of Buffer Solution for Measurement of Calcium Concentration Change in FlexStation II384 First, a buffer solution for assay was prepared for use in the manufacture of fluorescent dye solution. This buffer solution was prepared by adding 1M HEPES solution (Invitrogen) to HBSS (Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution) (Invitrogen) and then adding 1M NaOH (Nacalai Tesque) to adjust pH to 7.4. Then the fluorescent dye solution was prepared according to the manufacturer's instruction attached to Calcium 5 Assay Kit (Molecular Devices), and the final DMSO concentration was adjusted to 2%. (4) Pre-Treatment for Measurement by FlexStation II384 The fluorescent dye solution was added in an amount of 100 μl/well to supernatant of the cell culture plate cultured for 24 hours. The plate was cultured for 1 hour under the condition of 5% CO2 and 37° C. so that the fluorescent dye was inserted into the cell. Test compounds (i.e., the compounds prepared in the Examples) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO ACROS) were diluted 200-fold in the buffer solution for assay to prepare compound solutions corresponding to the respective concentrations. As a positive-control solution, the compound of TAK-875 was diluted 200-fold in the buffer solution for assay. TAK-875 is a GPR40 receptor agonist disclosed in WO 2008/001931 (Applicant: to Takeda Pharmaceuticals Company), and it was prepared according to the method described in ACS Med. Chem. Lett., 2010, 290. 500 of the prepared sample solutions was added to each well of 96-well polypropylene plates (NUNC), and thereby a compound plate was prepared. Finally, the compound plate and the cell culture plate cultured for 1 hour with the fluorescent dye were placed in FlexStation II384. (5) Measurement by FlexStation II384 After the above pre-treatment, the change in the intracellular calcium concentration when each concentration of the test compound solutions was added at 50 μl was measured by FlexStation II384. GPR40 agonist activity of the test compound solutions in each concentration was calculated as relative activity value (%) when the change in intracellular calcium concentration induced by 10 μM of TAK-875 compound which was used as a positive control is 100%. Then, the relative activity values depending on the concentration of the compound were plotted using Prism 4 software (GraphPad) to calculate the EC0.5 value. The EC0.5 value represents the concentration of the compound that exhibits 50% activity compared to the positive control and was used to compare the agonist activities between the test compounds. (6) Results The results are shown in Table 1. In the table, “+++” indicates that EC0.5 value is greater than or equal to 0.001 μM to less than 0.05 μM, “++” indicates that EC0.5 value is greater than or equal to 0.05 μM to less than 0.5 μM, and “+” indicates that EC0.5 value is greater than or equal to 0.5 μM.
