Example 28. Preparation of Comparative PAG, CPAG-5
A 100 mL flask was charged with 1, 1-Difluoro-2-oxo-2-(1-adamntylamino)ethanesulfonyl fluoride (SM-2) (1.62 g, 5.19 mmol, 1.0 eq.), 2-Hydroxypropiophenone (SM-10) (0.78 g, 5.19 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and THF (26 mL) under nitrogen stream and the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes at −50° C. n-BuLi (1.6 M, 3.2 mL, 5.19 mmol, 1.0 eq.) was added dropwise to the mixture over 10 minutes. The mixture was stirred for 2 hours at −50° C. to 10° C. 1N HCl (26 mL) was added to the final reaction mixture and then AcOEt (78 mL) was added. The upper layer was separated and the lower layer was extracted with AcOEt (52 mL) and then the organic solutions were combined. This solution was washed with 1N HCl (26 mL) and brine (26 mL) and the solution was subsequently dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and filtered. Solvents were removed in an evaporator and then hexane (75 mL) was added to the residue and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at −50° C. The hexane was then removed by decantation. CHCl3 (100 mL) was added to the residue and the solid remained was filtrated off. The filtrate was then concentrated in an evaporator. This crude product was partially purified by column chromatography (hexane/AcOEt) to obtain an oily material. Hexane (30 mL) was added to the concentrated oil and the mixture was stirred for 10 minutes at −50° C. Hexane was removed by decantation and CHCl3 (30 mL) was added to the remaining material and filtrated. Filtrate was concentrated in an evaporator and the target PAG as colorless oil (0.22 g) in 9.6% yield was obtained.
