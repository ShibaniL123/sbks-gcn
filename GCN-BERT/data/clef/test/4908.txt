ECG LEAD SET AND ECG ADAPTER SYSTEM FIELD [0001] The present disclosure relates to medical equipment. In particular, the present disclosure relates to an ECG lead set, adapter system and methods for coupling an ECG lead set with an incompatible ECG device that may monitor or record ECG signals, hereinafter referred collectively as an “ECG monitor.” DESCRIPTION [0002] Electrocardiograph (ECG) monitors are widely used to obtain biopotential signals containing information indicative of the electrical activity associated with the heart and pulmonary system. To obtain biopotential signals ECG electrodes are applied to the skin of a patient in various locations and coupled to an ECG monitor. Placement of the electrodes is dependant on the information sought by the clinician. [0003] The placement of the ECG electrodes on the patient has been established by medical protocols. The most common protocols require the placement of the electrodes in a 3-lead, a 5-lead or a 12-lead configuration. A 3-lead configuration requires the placement of three electrodes; one electrode adjacent each clavicle bone on the upper chest and a third electrode adjacent the patient’s lower left abdomen. A 5-lead configuration requires the placement of the three electrodes in the 3-lead configuration with the addition of a fourth electrode adjacent the sternum and a fifth electrode on the patient’s lower right abdomen. A 12-lead configuration requires the placement of 10 electrodes on the patient’s body. Four electrodes, which represent the patient’s limbs, include the left arm electrode (LA lead), the right arm electrode (RA lead), the left leg electrode (LL lead), and the right leg electrode (RL lead). Six chest electrodes (VI V6 leads) are placed on the patient's chest at various locations near the heart. Three standard limb leads are constructed from measurements between the right arm and left arm (Lead I), the right arm and the left leg (Lead II) and the left arm to left leg (Lead III). The ten electrodes provide 12 measurement points consisting of Leads I, II, III, AVL, AVR, AVF, and VI-V6 with the right leg electrode typically used as a ground. [0004] Electrodes, after placement on the patient, connect to an ECG monitor by an ECG lead set. One end of the ECG lead set, closest to the patient, connects to each electrode (alternatively, the electrodes may be integrated into the distal end of the ECG lead set) and receives biopotential signals from the body. The other end of the ECG lead set connects to the ECG input connector and supplies the biopotential signals received from the body to the ECG monitor. [0005] ECG monitors and ECG lead sets are manufactured and sold by various companies. Although protocols have been established for the placement ECG electrodes, the various manufacturers typically use product specific connectors and wiring configurations. [0006] Problems occur when an ECG lead set and an ECG monitor are electrically incompatible but have mechanically compatible connectors. While some problems may be automatically detected by the monitor, other problems, such as, for example, the incorrect order of V1-V6, may go undetected and the ECG monitor may provide the clinician with erroneous information. [0007] Some ECG monitors are configured to connect to a specific type or family of ECG lead sets manufactured, distributed and sold by the same manufacturer of the ECG monitor. The ECG monitor, and specific type or family of ECG lead sets, may utilize, as a safety feature, a unique or specialized connector that is only compatible with the particular ECG monitor and incompatible with all other ECG lead sets. [0008] While this safety feature may prevent a clinician from accidentally connecting an incompatible lead set to an ECG monitor, it also required each medical facility to supply a plurality of ECG lead sets for the various ECG monitor used within a medical facility. [0009] The present application provides an ECG lead set, adapter system and methods for coupling a standard ECG lead set with any incompatible ECG monitor thus preventing the afore mentioned problems. OBJECT [0009a] It is the object of the present invention to substantially overcome or ameliorate one or more of the disadvantages of the prior art, or at least provide a useful alternative.

Lead set connectors 121,131 and lead set receptacles are formed with connectors not presently associated or used with current ECG monitors, such as, for example, but not limited to, RJ45 and RJ25 telephone connectors commonly used in the telecommunications industry but not presently associated with ECG monitors. Alternatively, lead set connectors 121, 131 and lead set receptacles 112a, 112b may be designed and/or constructed specifically for this application. [0042] In use, the lead set connector 121,131 couples to the respective lead set receptacle 112a, 112b. For example, lead set connector 121 may be an RJ25 connector and may connect to an RJ25 lead set receptacle 112a of the adapter receptacle 112. Similarly, lead set connector 131 may be an RJ45 connector and may connect to an RJ45 lead set receptacle 112b of the adapter receptacle 112. Monitor plug 113 couples to the lead set input connector 24 of the ECG monitor 20 thereby electrically connecting electrode connectors 121a-e and/or electrodes 150a-e to the ECG monitor 20. As a further alternative, RJ11, RJ14 and RJ50 lead set connectors and corresponding receptacles are also envisioned . [0043] Variations of the adapter 110 from FIG. 1 are illustrated in FIGS. 2A-2C.

The input connector 224a on ECG monitor 220a may be configured to receive a lead set connector that may connect one or more types of lead sets to the ECG monitor 220a, e.g., configured to connect to a 3-lead lead set, a 5-lead lead set and/or a 12-lead lead set. Lead set receptacle 212a on adapter 210a may also be configured to connect to a single type of lead set connector that may connect to a 3-lead lead set, a 5-lead lead set and/or a 12-lead lead set, or other types of ECG lead sets, and configured as an ECG lead sets described herein. Lugs 214 on adapter 210a may connect to terminals 225a on ECG monitor 220a. [0044] In FIG.2B, adapter 210b includes two monitoring plugs 213b, 213c that connect to a first input connector 224b and a second input connector 224c of ECG monitor 220b. First input connector 224b of the ECG monitor 220b may be configured to receive a first type of ECG Lead set, such as, for example, a 3-lead EGC lead set, and second connector 224c of the ECG monitor 220b may be configured to receive a different type of ECG lead set, such as, for example, a 5-lead ECG lead set or a 12-lead ECG lead set. Adapter 210b may include a first lead set receptacle 212b and a second lead set receptacle 212c configured to connect to an ECG lead set of the present disclosure as described herein. [0045] In FIG. 2C, adapter 210c includes an adapter body 211 and one or more remote adapter bodies 211a, 211b having one or more monitor plugs 213d, 213℮. Monitor plugs 213d, 213℮ are configured to connect with first and second input connectors 224d, 224℮, respectively, of the ECG monitor 220c. First and second adapter bodies 211a, 211b are connected to the adapter body 211 through cable 215a, 215b or other suitable means of forming an electrical and/or mechanical connection. [0046] Other suitable variations of a monitor plug required to connect an adapter of the present disclosure to various other ECG monitors are contemplated and within the scope of this disclosure. [0047] FIG. 4Α is yet another embodiment of an ECG adapter system 300 including an adapter 310 and an ECG lead set 330 having a separable or tearable ribbon cable 360. A lead set connector 321 is coupled to the proximal end of the ribbon cable 360 and a plurality of electrodes 321a-e, or plurality of electrode connectors (not shown), are coupled the distal end of the individual lead wires 320a-320e. One or more adhesive backed sliders 361 may be slidably disposed on a portion of the ribbon cable 360. [0048] Adapter 310 includes an adapter body 311, an input receptacle 312 and a monitoring plug 313. Input receptacle 312 includes at least one lead set receptacle 312a. Lead set receptacle 312a may be configured to receive an RJ25 connector or any other suitable receptacle or connector may be used. Monitoring plug 313 is configured to connect to an input connector 324 of an ECG monitor 320. [0049] In use, as illustrated in FIG. 4Β, the distal portion of one or more individual lead wires 320a-320e may separated from, or may be pulled away from, one or more of the remaining lead wires forming the ribbon cable 360 in order to increase the distal portion of an individual lead wires 320a-320e separated from the ribbon cable 360 or from the other individual lead wires 320a-320e. For example, distal end of lead wires 320℮ and 320d may be further separated from the ribbon cable 360 such that the respective electrodes 321d, 321℮ may be disposed on the lower abdomen “la” of patient “p”. Similarly, distal end of lead wires 320b and 320c are further separated from each other such that the respective electrodes 321b, 321c may be disposed on the patient “p” adjacent the left and right side of the upper chest “uc”. Adhesive backed sliders 361 may be positioned on the ribbon cable 360 and disposed on the patient “p” to secure ECG adapter system 300 on the patient “p” and/or to prevent further separation of the ribbon cable 360. [0050] In a further embodiment of the present disclosure, ribbon cable 360 of the ECG adapter system 300 may include a plurality of layers to electrically shield the wires of the ribbon cable 360 from electrical interference or noise. Alternatively, lead wires 320a-320e that form the ribbon cable 360 may be individually shielded.
