FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to cosmetics, and more particularly relates to agents for dyeing keratinic fibers, in particular human hair, the agents containing specific combinations of cationic anthraquinone dyes with further cationic dyes, with amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants, and with cationic polymers. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Either direct dyes or oxidation dyes are generally used for dyeing keratinic fibers. Although intense coloring with good fastness properties may be achieved with oxidation dyes, the development of the color generally takes place under the influence of oxidizing agents such as H2O2, which in some cases may result in damage to the fiber. In addition, some oxidation dye precursors or certain mixtures of oxidation dye precursors may have a sensitizing effect in persons with sensitive skin. Direct dyes are applied under milder conditions. However, they have the disadvantage that the colorings have insufficient fastness properties, in particular during washing of the hair, but also with respect to external influences such as sunlight or reactive environmental chemicals, for example swimming pool water. Such colorings are also generally much more sensitive to shampooing than the oxidative colorings, so that an often undesirable change in shade, or even a visible discoloration, then occurs much more quickly. In addition to an attractive hair color, the consumer also desires lustrous hair. Lustrous hair looks attractive and healthy, and the hairstyle is perceived as being well cared for and full of vitality. In many cases, the consumer has a number of wishes that he/she would like to fulfill at the same time; i.e., the consumer wants an attractive hair color, and also wants lustrous hair. For practical reasons, for this purpose the consumer would prefer to use only one treatment method on the hair. Various methods are already known from the prior art for coloring the hair in a great variety of shades. A large number of various formulations is disclosed in CA 2613049 A1, for example. However, there is still a need for novel coloring agents which produce intense coloring, and at the same time, exceptionally high luster. In particular, there is a need for novel coloring agents which are able to produce a long-lasting luster. The hair which is dyed with these agents should not lose its luster after one, or at the most, several, weeks, and instead, its luster should still be noticeable even after multiple hair washings. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Agent for dyeing keratinic fibers, in particular human hair, containing in a cosmetic carrier at least one cationic anthraquinone derivative of formula (I) wherein R1, R2, R3 independently stand for a C1-C6 alkyl group, n stands for an integer from 2 to 8, and A stands for a physiologically acceptable anion; at least one further cationic direct dye which is different from formula (I); at least one amphoteric and/or zwitterionic surfactant; and at least one cationic polymer. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following detailed description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented in the preceding background of the invention or the following detailed description of the invention. The object of the present invention, therefore, is to provide novel direct dyes which intensely color the hair and at the same time impart a very high luster to the hair. The luster of the colorings produced with these agents should be long-lasting, and should persist after multiple hair washings. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description of the invention and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and this background of the invention. It has now surprisingly been found that agents which contain a combination of a specific cationic anthraquinone derivative with a further cationic dye, with an amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactant, and with a cationic polymer, intensely color the hair and at the same time impart a high luster to the hair. Furthermore, the luster produced with these agents is long-lasting, and is still visible even after multiple hair washings or shampoo treatments. At the same time, these agents also meet all other requirements imposed on the coloring agents for keratinic fibers with regard to their technical application properties, their fastness properties, their toxicological profile, their industrial manufacturability, and their storage stability. A first subject matter of the present invention relates to an agent for dyeing keratinic fibers, in particular human hair, the agent containing in a cosmetic carrier (a) at least one cationic anthraquinone derivative of formula (I) wherein R1, R2, R3 independently stand for a C1-C6 alkyl group, n stands for an integer from 2 to 8, and A stands for a physiologically acceptable anion, (b) at least one further cationic direct dye which is different from formula (I), (c) at least one amphoteric and/or zwitterionic surfactant, and (d) at least one cationic polymer. Keratinic fibers, also referred to as keratin fibers, are understood to mean fur, wool, feathers, and in particular human hair. Although the agents according to the invention are primarily suited for dyeing keratin fibers, use in other fields is also possible in principle. The term “agents for dyeing” keratin fibers which is used according to the invention is understood to mean coloring agents which dye the keratin fibers on the basis of direct dyes. In addition, these agents may also contain oxidation dye precursors, so-called developer and coupler components. Developers and couplers diffuse separately into the keratin fiber, and under the influence of an alkalizing agent (ammonia, for example) and an oxidizing agent (usually hydrogen peroxide) form the actual dyes in a chemical reaction with one another. If the agents for dyeing hair contain solely direct dyes, the hair is dyed without at the same time being lightened. However, if the agents additionally contain developer, coupler, and/or oxidizing agent, the keratin fibers are also lightened due to the oxidizing agent that is additionally contained. In the sense of the present invention, a lightening coloring is encompassed by the definition of “coloring.” The agents according to the invention contain the active substances in a cosmetic carrier, preferably in a suitable aqueous, alcoholic, or aqueous-alcoholic carrier. For the purposes of the hair treatment, such carriers are, for example, creams, emulsions, gels, or also surfactant-containing foaming solutions such as shampoos, aerosol foams, foam formulations, or other preparations that are suitable for applying to the hair. However, it is also conceivable to integrate the agents according to the invention into a powdered or also a tablet formulation. In the sense of the present invention, aqueous-alcoholic solutions are understood to mean aqueous solutions containing 3 to 70% by weight of a C1-C4 alcohol, in particular ethanol or isopropanol. The agents according to the invention may additionally contain further organic solvents such as methoxybutanol, benzyl alcohol, ethyl diglycol, or 1,2-propylene glycol. All water-soluble organic solvents are preferred. In the sense of the invention, the aqueous carrier contains at least 30% by weight, in particular at least 50% by weight, water, based on the total weight of the agents. Aqueous carriers are preferred according to the invention. As the first important ingredient (a), the agents according to the invention contain at least one cationic anthraquinone derivative of formula (I) wherein R1, R2, R3 independently stand for a C1-C6 alkyl group, n stands for an integer from 2 to 8, and A− stands for a physiologically acceptable anion. In this regard, the radicals R1, R2, and R3 independently stand for a C1-C6 alkyl group. In one preferred embodiment, R1 and R2 each stand for a methyl group. In another preferred embodiment, R3 stands for a methyl group, an ethyl group, an n-propyl group, or an isopropyl group. R1 and R2 in each case very particularly preferably stand for a methyl group, and R3 stands for an n-propyl group. It is further preferred when n stands for the numbers 2 or 3, and n very particularly preferably stands for the number 3. A− stands for a physiologically acceptable anion. Suitable physiologically acceptable anions are halide, hydrogen sulfate, ½ sulfate, benzene sulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, acetate, citrate, lactate, ½ tartrate, methyl sulfate (H3COSO3−), or trifluoromethanesulfonate. A− particularly preferably stands for bromide or for methyl sulfate (H3COSO3−), and A− very particularly preferably stands for bromide. One particularly preferred embodiment is an agent for dyeing keratinic fibers, which is characterized in that the agent contains at least one cationic anthraquinone derivative (a) of formula (I), in which R1 and R2 each stand for a methyl group, R3 stands for an n-propyl group, and n stands for the numbers 2 or 3, preferably for the number 3. Particularly intense and lustrous colorings may be produced when compound (la) is used in the agent according to the invention as the cationic anthraquinone derivative of formula (I) where A− stands for a physiologically acceptable anion, preferably for methyl sulfate (H3COSO3−) or bromide, particularly preferably for bromide. Compound (la), in which A− stands for bromide, is also known under the designation HC Blue 16 or Bluequat B, Bluequat bromide, or under the chemical name 3-{[9,10-dihydro-4-(methylamino)-9,10-dioxo-1-anthracenyl]amino}-N,N-dimethyl-N-propyl-1-propanaminium bromide. The agents according to the invention for dyeing keratin fibers preferably contain the compound(s) of formula (I) in quantities of greater than or equal to 0.0005% by weight and less than or equal to 0.5% by weight, in each case based on the total weight of the agent. The basis for calculations for these quantity statements is in each case the total quantity of all anthraquinone dyes of formula (I) contained in the agent according to the invention. In one particularly preferred embodiment, an agent according to the invention is characterized in that it contains one or more cationic anthraquinone derivatives of formula (I) in a total quantity of 0.0005 to 0.5% by weight, preferably 0.02 to 0.4% by weight, more preferably 0.05 to 0.3% by weight, and particularly preferably 0.10 to 0.35% by weight, in each case based on the total weight of the agent. As the second important component, the agent according to the invention contains at least one further cationic direct dye (b) which is different from formula (I). In this regard, a cationic dye is understood to mean a dye having a cationic charge. This cationic charge may be situated on a quaternary nitrogen atom. Quaternary nitrogen atoms have four different organic radicals, as the result of which the nitrogen atom is positively charged. However, it is likewise possible for the cationic charge to be situated on a nitrogen-containing heterocycle of the direct dye. If this heterocycle is part of the chromophoric system, the positive charge of the direct dye may also be delocalized over the entire chromophoric system. Lastly, it is likewise possible that the cationic dye is a cationic triarylmethane dye, in which the cationic charge is delocalized within the triarylmethane system. Particularly intense color results may be produced in conjunction with a high, long-lasting luster when the agent according to the invention contains at least one dye from the group Basic Blue 7, Basic Blue 26, Basic Violet 2, Basic Violet 14, Basic Yellow 57, Basic Red 76, Basic Blue 99, Basic Brown 16, Basic Brown 17, Basic Yellow 87, Basic Orange 31, Basic Red 51, and Cationic Blue 347 as the further cationic direct dye (b) which is different from formula (I).

Within the above-mentioned group of cationic direct dyes (b) which are different from formula (I), certain specific dyes are characterized in that they may be used to produce colorings having a particularly exceptional luster when, in combination with the other important components (a), (c), and (d), they are used to color keratinic fibers. A particularly high luster may be achieved when at least one compound from the group Basic Yellow 87, Basic Orange 31, Basic Red 51, Basic Violet 2, and Cationic Blue 347 is used as the further cationic direct dye (b). The highest luster may be obtained with one or more of the compounds from the group Basic Yellow 87, Basic Orange 31, Basic Red 51, Basic Violet 2 in combination with the further important components (a), (c), and (d). In one explicitly mentioned very particularly preferred embodiment, an agent according to the invention is therefore characterized in that the cationic direct dye(s) (b) which are/is different from formula (I) are/is at least one dye selected from the group Basic Yellow 87, Basic Orange 31, Basic Red 51, Basic Violet 2, and Cationic Blue 347, preferably from the group Basic Yellow 87, Basic Orange 31, Basic Red 51, and Basic Violet 2. The preferred and particularly preferred cationic direct dyes (b) are the following compounds: The cationic direct dyes which are different from formula (I) are contained in the agent according to the invention in preferred quantity ranges. The quantities should be selected in such a way that they are great enough to achieve a high luster, but on the other hand small enough to avoid the disadvantages associated with an excessive use concentration of the dyes, such as increased discoloration of the skin or possible skin irritation. These prerequisites are met when the agents according to the invention contain one or more cationic direct dyes (b) which are different from formula (I) in a total quantity of greater than or equal to 0.0005 and less than or equal to 0.55% by weight, in each case based on the total weight of the agent.

As the third important component, the agents according to the invention contain at least one amphoteric and/or zwitterionic surfactant (c). Surfactants are amphiphilic (bifunctional) compounds composed of at least one hydrophobic and at least one hydrophilic molecule portion. The hydrophobic radical is preferably a hydrocarbon chain which contains 8-24 carbon atoms and which may be saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched. This C8-C24 alkyl chain is particularly preferably linear. Basic properties of the surfactants are the targeted absorption to boundary surfaces, as well as the aggregation into micelles and the formation of lyotropic phases. Amphoteric surfactants are subdivided into ampholytic surfactants and zwitterionic surfactants. Ampholytic surfactants are understood to mean those surface-active compounds which have acidic hydrophilic groups (—COOH or —SO3H groups, for example) and basic hydrophilic groups (amino groups, for example), and which thus have acidic or basic behavior, depending on the conditions. Zwitterionic surfactants are understood by those skilled in the art to mean surfactants which bear both a negative and a positive charge in the same molecule. Examples of preferred zwitterionic surfactants (c) are betaines, N-alkyl-N,N-dimethylammonium glycinates, N-acyl-aminopropyl-N,N-dimethylammonium glycinates, and 2-alkyl-3-carboxymethyl-3-hydroxyethyl imidazolines, in each case having 8 to 24 C atoms in the alkyl group. Examples of preferred ampholytic surfactants (c) are N-alkylglycine, N-alkylaminopropionic acids, N-alkylaminobutyric acids, N-alkyliminodipropionic acids, N-hydroxyethyl-N-alkylamidopropylglycines, N-alkyltaurines, N-alkylsarcosines, 2-alkylaminopropionic acids, and alkylaminoacetic acids, in each case having 8 to 24 C atoms in the alkyl group.

Within the group of amphoteric and/or zwitterionic surfactants, the compounds of formulas (II) and/or (Ill) are very particularly preferred, since the highest luster may be produced on keratinic fibers when these compounds are used.

To ensure electroneutrality, the deprotonated carboxylic acid may also be present in the form of its respective salt, preferably its alkali metal (Na, K) salt. For achieving the stated object of the invention, very particularly suited amphoteric and/or zwitterionic surfactants of formula (II) are the compounds known under the INCI name disodium cocoamphodipropionate. For achieving the stated object of the invention, very particularly suited amphoteric and/or zwitterionic surfactants of formula (III) are the compounds known under the INCI name cocamidopropyl betaine. The amphoteric and/or zwitterionic surfactants (c) are preferably contained in the agents according to the invention in certain quantity ranges.

In another preferred embodiment, an agent according to the invention is characterized in that it contains one or more amphoteric and/or zwitterionic surfactants (c) in a total quantity of 0.1 to 4.0% by weight, preferably 0.2 to 2.5% by weight, more preferably 0.4 to 1.8% by weight, and particularly preferably 0.6 to 0.9% by weight, in each case based on the total weight of the agent. As the fourth important component, the agents according to the invention contain at least one cationic polymer (d). Polymers are understood to mean macromolecules having a molecular weight of at least 1000 g/mol, preferably at least 2500 g/mol, particularly preferably at least 5000 g/mol, and which consist of identical repeating organic units. Polymers are produced by polymerization of one monomer type, or by polymerization of various monomer types which are structurally different from one another. If the polymer is produced by polymerization of one monomer type, it is referred to as a homopolymer. If structurally different monomer types are used in the polymerization, the resulting polymer is referred to as a copolymer. The maximum molecular weight of the polymer depends on the degree of polymerization (the number of polymerized monomers), and is determined by the polymerization method. In the sense of the present invention, it is preferred when the maximum molecular weight of the cationic polymer (d) is not greater than 107 g/mol, preferably not greater than 106 g/mol, and particularly preferably not greater than 105 g/mol. Cationic polymers are understood to mean those polymers which contain cationic groups in the macromolecule (polymer). These cationic groups contained in the macromolecule (polymer) are quaternary ammonium groups. In the course of the studies leading to the present invention, it has been shown that particularly intense colorings and high luster values may be achieved when specific cationic polymers together with the further important components (a), (b), and (c) are used in a formulation.

Schrader, Grundlagen and Rezepturen der Kosmetika [Fundamentals and Formulations of Cosmetics], 2nd Edition, Hüthig Buch Verlag, Heidelberg, 1989. The additional active substances and auxiliary substances are preferably used in the agents according to the invention in each case in quantities of 0.0001 to 25% by weight, in particular 0.0005 to 15% by weight, based on the total weight of the application mixture. For using the agent according to the invention, in particular a method for dyeing and optionally lightening of keratinic fibers, in particular human hair, is suitable which is characterized in that an agent of the first subject matter of the invention is applied to the keratin-containing fibers, left on the fibers for 5 to 60 minutes, and subsequently rinsed out with water or washed out with a shampoo. The exposure period for the ready-to-apply coloring agent is preferably 5 to 45 min, in particular 10 to 40 min, particularly preferably 15 to 35 min. During the exposure period of the agent on the fiber, it may be advantageous to assist the lightening operation by supplying heat. Heat may be supplied via an external heat source, such as hot air from a hot air blower, and, in particular for hair lightening on living subjects, also via the body temperature of the subject. In the latter option, the area to be lightened is customarily covered with a hood. An exposure phase at room temperature is likewise in accordance with the invention. In particular, the temperature during the exposure period is between 20° C. and 40° C., in particular between 25° C. and 38° C. After conclusion of the exposure period, the remaining color preparation is rinsed from the hair with water or a cleaning agent. In particular standard shampoo may be used as cleaning agent, in which case in particular the cleaning agent may be dispensed with, and the rinsing operation may take place using water when the coloring agent has a strong surfactant-containing carrier. The agents according to the invention may be formulated and appropriately used as one-component agents (coloring and lightening agents) or as multi-component agents, such as two-component agents or three-component agents. Separation into multicomponent systems is useful in particular where there is an expectation of or concern for incompatibilities of the ingredients; in such systems, the agent to be used is prepared by the consumer directly before application by mixing the components. If the agent according to the invention contains direct dyes, and optionally also oxidation dye precursors as well as oxidizing agent, to prevent a premature, undesirable reaction of these substances with one another, they are advantageously packaged separately, and brought into contact only immediately before use. A dyeing method in which the coloring cream and the oxidizing agent are initially present in separate form is therefore preferred. A further subject matter of the present invention therefore relates to a method for dyeing and lightening human hair, in which a water-based composition containing hydrogen peroxide is mixed with an agent according to the invention containing the important components (a), (b), (c), and (d) to produce a homogeneous composition, which is applied to the hair. The formulation containing a combination of (a) at least one cationic anthraquinone derivative of formula (I) wherein R1, R2, R3 independently stand for a C1-C6 alkyl group, n stands for an integer from 2 to 8, and A− stands for a physiologically acceptable anion, (b) at least one further cationic direct dye which is different from formula (I), (c) at least one amphoteric and/or zwitterionic surfactant, and (d) at least one cationic polymer, is very well suited for producing intense colorings having a high, long-lasting luster on keratinic fibers. A further subject matter of the present invention relates to the use of an agent of the first subject matter of the invention for producing hair colorings having an enhanced, long-lasting luster. The statements concerning the agents according to the invention similarly apply with regard to further preferred embodiments of the method according to the invention.

The previously produced coloring formulations were then applied to the measured hair strands (Kerling) (solution ratio 4:1, 4 g cream per g hair) and allowed to act for 30 minutes. The hair strands were subsequently rinsed out and dried. The dried hair strands were measured a second time in the luster apparatus. The luster apparatus is a luster chamber provided with a light-absorbing lining. The hair strands to be measured were clamped onto a cylinder and positioned in the middle of the luster chamber. As the illumination source, a rod-shaped gas discharge lamp which illuminated the hair strands, clamped onto the cylinder, through a small aperture was situated above the cylinder. The luster curve of each strand was measured using a digital camera and evaluated by image analysis. The luster value of the strands (L) was subsequently calculated according to the Reich and Robbins formula (1): L Reich  /  Robbins = S D * W 1 / 2 L: luster S: directed reflection D: diffuse reflection W½: half-width of the luster curve (1) C. Reich and C. C. Robbins, J. Soc. Cosmet. Chem. 44, 221-234 (1993) The change in luster was assessed by comparing the luster values measured before and after application of the agent according to the invention. Statistical methods were used to calculate whether the change in luster was significant. The following luster values were obtained in the measurements. The higher the luster value, the higher the luster.
