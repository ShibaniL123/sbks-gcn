METHODS AND REAGENTS FOR RADIOLABELING CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] The present invention claims priority to US provisional patent application no. 61/919,901, filed December 23, 2013, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] Hsp90 is a family of proteins involved in many cellular functions, including the cellular defense against stress, the stability and function of mutated proteins, and the conformational maturation of key proteins involved in the growth response of cells to extracellular factors. In addition, Hsp90 has also been shown to be overexpressed in multiple tumor types and as a function of oncogenic transformation. Hsp90 inhibitors are therefore a highly pursued target in drug discovery efforts. [0003] Radiolabeled Hsp90 inhibitors can be used clinically in a variety of applications related to treatment regimen, diagnosis, and patient monitoring. However, the currently available methods for placing a radioisotope on an Hsp90 inhibitor compound are prohibitively expensive due to poor yields and/or synthetic routes that sacrifice significant amounts of precious radioisotope. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0004] The present invention provides, among other things, novel methods for the synthesis of radiolabelled compounds. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides compounds of formula I: I 1 2 3 4 1 2 1 2 3 wherein each of R , R\ R\ R , L, X, Y , Y Z Z and V is as defined above and described in classes and subclasses herein. In some embodiments, the present invention provides methods of using compounds of formula I to provide radiolabeled analogs. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING [0005] Figure 1 depicts an HPLC profile of purified [131I]-Compound 5 (PU-H71). DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0006] The present invention encompasses the recognition that the ability to measure particular forms of Hsp90 is advantageous to patient selection, treatment, and outcome. For example, in the cancer context, there exists an "oncogenic Hsp90" species, the abundance of which is not dictated by Hsp90 expression alone, that can be used to predict for sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibition therapy. Measuring the presence and/or abundance of this oncogenic Hsp90 in tumors is therefore a method to predict patient response to Hsp90 therapy. The use of labeled Hsp90 inhibitors facilitates measuring the abundance of oncogenic Hsp90 in a multitude of tumors and tumor cells, as demonstrated by Applicant's prior work disclosed in International Patent Publication No. WO2013/009655. However, Applicant has shown that cancer is not the only case in which the presence of various Hsp90 species is relevant. For example, neurodegenerative contexts also display a pathogenic (i.e., stress-specific) Hsp90, the relative abundance of which can be measured using labeled Hsp90 inhibitors (WO2013/009655). [0007] One problem with the current methodologies for radiolabeling is that radioisotopes are expensive, and the loss of material during synthesis of a radiolabeled compound is very costly. In particular, poor-yielding synthesis or lackluster synthetic routes often cause the loss of significant amounts of radioisotope. However, improved synthetic routes to radiolabeled compounds can make the production of such chemical tools much more economically feasible, as demonstrated by the ensuing Examples. Thus, in some embodiments, the present invention provides the identification of a previously unknown problem, namely that the expense of synthesizing labeled compounds was detrimental to the production and availability of radiolabeled Hsp90 inhibitors in both the pre-clinical and clinical medicine. [0008] In one particular example, the existing process for preparing radiolabeled PU-H71 (compound 5, infra) requires the use of a tin-labeled precursor that is Boc-protected (3), as shown in Scheme A, below. This intermediate 3 can provide radiolabeled PU-H71 (5) in two steps as is shown in Scheme A (steps c and d). The first step is radioiodination (step c) followed by removal of the Boc group (step d). Scheme A 1 PU-H71 2 3 Synthesis of stannane precursor 3 and labeled compound 5. Reagents and conditions: a. Et3N, (Boc)20, CH2CI2, rt; b. Pd(PPh3)4, hexamethylditin, dioxane, 90°C; c. [124l]-Nal, chloramine-T, 50°C; d. 6M HCI, 50°C. [0009] Since the cost of radioactive isotopes is high, (i.e. the cost for iodine-124 -250$ per mCi) any improvement in the yields is extremely useful to lower production costs. In certain embodiments, the present invention provides methods to improve the synthesis of labeled Hsp90 inhibitors by reducing the current two-step procedure to a single step by removing the second step in the current process (i.e., step d). In addition to producing more consistent results, provided methods have higher typical isolated yields and require less radiochemistry time, resulting in significant cost savings per dose of radiolabeled compound. Such methods and others are described below in the ensuing description and Examples.

Thus, the compounds of the present invention can be administered by injection (e.g. intravenously, intramuscularly, intracutaneously, subcutaneously, intraduodenally, or intraperitoneally). Also, the compounds described herein can be administered by inhalation, for example, intranasally. Additionally, the compounds of the present invention can be administered transdermally. It is also envisioned that multiple routes of administration (e.g., intramuscular, oral, transdermal) can be used to administer the compounds of the invention. [0107] For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from the compounds of the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can be either solid or liquid. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories, and dispersible granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substance that may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material. [0108] In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid in a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding properties in suitable proportions and compacted in the shape and size desired. [0109] The powders and tablets preferably contain from 5% to 70% of the active compound. Suitable carriers are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter, and the like. The term "preparation" is intended to include the formulation of the active compound with encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active component with or without other carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets, and lozenges can be used as solid dosage forms suitable for oral administration. [0110] For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as a mixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogeneous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool, and thereby to solidify. [0111] Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions, for example, water or water/propylene glycol solutions. For parenteral injection, liquid preparations can be formulated in solution in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. [0112] When parenteral application is needed or desired, particularly suitable admixtures for the compounds of the invention are injectable, sterile solutions, preferably oily or aqueous solutions, as well as suspensions, emulsions, or implants, including suppositories. In particular, carriers for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of dextrose, saline, pure water, ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, peanut oil, sesame oil, polyoxyethylene-block polymers, and the like. Ampoules are convenient unit dosages. The compounds of the invention can also be incorporated into liposomes or administered via transdermal pumps or patches. Pharmaceutical admixtures suitable for use in the present invention include those described, for example, in Pharmaceutical Sciences (17th Ed., Mack Pub. Co., Easton, PA) and WO 96/05309, the teachings of both of which are hereby incorporated by reference. [0113] Aqueous solutions suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizers, and thickening agents as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and other well-known suspending agents. [0114] Also included are solid form preparations that are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions, and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents, and the like. [0115] The pharmaceutical preparation is preferably in unit dosage form. In such form the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. [0116] The quantity of active component in a unit dose preparation may be varied or adjusted from 0.1 mg to 10000 mg, more typically 1.0 mg to 1000 mg, most typically 10 mg to 500 mg, according to the particular application and the potency of the active component. The composition can, if desired, also contain other compatible therapeutic agents. [0117] Some compounds may have limited solubility in water and therefore may require a surfactant or other appropriate co-solvent in the composition. Such co-solvents include: Polysorbate 20, 60, and 80; Pluronic F-68, F-84, and P-103; cyclodextrin; and polyoxyl 35 castor oil. Such co-solvents are typically employed at a level between about 0.01 % and about 2% by weight. [0118] Viscosity greater than that of simple aqueous solutions may be desirable to decrease variability in dispensing the formulations, to decrease physical separation of components of a suspension or emulsion of formulation, and/or otherwise to improve the formulation. Such viscosity building agents include, for example, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl cellulose, chondroitin sulfate and salts thereof, hyaluronic acid and salts thereof, and combinations of the foregoing. Such agents are typically employed at a level between about 0.01% and about 2% by weight. [0119] The compositions of the present invention may additionally include components to provide sustained release and/or comfort. Such components include high molecular weight, anionic mucomimetic polymers, gelling polysaccharides, and finely-divided drug carrier substrates. These components are discussed in greater detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,911,920; 5,403,841; 5,212,162; and 4,861,760. The entire contents of these patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes. [0120] In order that the invention described herein may be more fully understood, the following examples are set forth. It should be understood that these examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed as limiting this invention in any manner. EXEMPLIFICATION [0121] As depicted in the Examples below, in certain exemplary embodiments, compounds are prepared according to the following general procedures. It will be appreciated that, although the general methods depict the synthesis of certain compounds of the present invention, the following general methods, and other methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art, can be applied to all compounds and subclasses and species of each of these compounds, as described herein. Example 1 Experimental details for the synthesis of compound 1-1 (Method 1) [0122] One route to 1-1 involves direct installation of the trimethyltin moiety onto PU- H71 (Method 1). The trimethyltin group is known to be unstable under acidic conditions and indeed, when 3 (see Scheme A, supra) was treated with dilute TFA (20% in CH2CI2), protodestannylation occurred in addition to cleavage of the Boc protecting group. Method 1 1 1-1 [0123] 9-(3-(isopropylamino)propyl)-8-((6-(trimethylstannyl)benzo[d][l,3]dioxol-5- yl)thio)-9H-purin-6-amine (I-l). Compound 1 (30 mg, 0.0585 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (3.4 mg, 0.0029 mmol), hexamethylditin (48 μί, 0.232 mmol) in dry dioxane (3 mL) was heated at 90 C in a 10 mL round-bottomed flask sealed with a rubber septum for 18 hours. The solvent was concentrated under vacuum and the crude product was purified via preparatory TLC (CHCl3:EtOAc:hexane:NH3/MeOH at 2: 1 :2:0.5) to afford I-l (13.2 mg, 41%, average over four experiments). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDC13) δ 8.26 (s, 1H), 7.02 (s, 1H), 6.98 (s, 1H), 5.98 (s, 2H), 5.63 (bs, 2H), 4.26 (t, J= 6.8 Hz, 2H), 2.73 (m, 1H), 2.57 ( t, J= 6.8 Hz, 2H), 2.02 (m, 2H), 1.06 (d, J= 10.6 Hz, 6H), 0.28 (s, 9H); LCMS found 551.2 [M+H]+. Example 2 Experimental details for the synthesis of compound I-l (Method 2) [0124] Method 2 utilized a protecting group strategy as an alternative to Method 1. Fmoc was chosen since it can be removed under mildly basic conditions, and importantly the trimethyltin moiety is stable under these conditions. [0125] (9H-fluoren-9-yl)methyl (3-(6-amino-8-((6-iodobenzo[d][l,3]dioxol-5-yl)thio)- 9H-purin-9-yl)propyl)(isopropyl)carbamate (2-2). To compound 1 (100 mg, 0.195 mmol) in a mixture of THF/water (4 mL: l mL) and cooled in an ice bath, 9-Fluorenylmethyl N-succinimidyl carbonate (98.5 mg, 0.292 mmol) was added as a solid in one portion followed by the addition of solid sodium bicarbonate (24.5 mg, 0.292 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 hours. The reaction was determined to be complete by TLC and LC-MS, LCMS found 735.4 [M+Hf. Then, the solvent was concentrated and the crude product was purified by preparatory TLC (DCM:MeOH 95:5) to afford 2-2 (126 mg, 88%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-de) δ 8.14 (s, 1H), 7.83 (br. s, 2H), 7.57 (br. s, 2H), 7.46 (s, 1H), 7.25-7.40 (m, 6H), 6.77 (s, 1H), 6.02 (s, 2H), 4.45 (d, J= 4.95 Hz, 2H), 4.19 (m, 1H), 4.08 (q, J= 5.26 Hz, 2H), 3.83-3.89 (m, 2H), 3.03 (m, 1H) 2.76 (m, 1H), 1.78 (m, 1H), 0.76-0.85 (m, 6 H).

Compound 2-2 (100 mg, 0.136 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (7.85 mg, 0.0068 mmol), hexamethylditin (178.2 mg, 0.544 mmol) in dry dioxane (6 mL) was heated at 90 C in a 25 mL round-bottomed flask sealed with a rubber septum for 18 hours. The solvent was concentrated and the crude product purified via preparatory TLC (CHC13: EtOAc: hexane: NH3/ MeOH at 2: 1 :2:0.5) to afford 2-3 (58.8 mg, 56%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDC13) δ 8.24 (s, 1H), 7.74 (d, J= 7.4 Hz, 2H), 7.65 (m, 1H), 7.54 (m, 2H), 7.46 (m, 1H), 7.35 (m, 2H), 7.28 (m, 3H), 6.95 (s, 1H), 5.93 (s, 2H), 5.65 (br. s., 2H), 4.55 (m, 2H), 4.21 (m, 2H), 3.83 (br s, 1H), 3.20 (m,lH), 2.91 (m, 1H), 1.78 (m, 1H), 0.97 (d, J= 4.9 Hz, 6H), 0.27 (s, 9H); LCMS found 773.4 [M+H]+. [0127] 9-(3-(isopropylamino)propyl)-8-((6-(trimethylstannyl)benzo[d][l,3]dioxol-5- yl)thio)-9H-purin-6-amine (I-l). To compound 2-3 (12 mg, 0.0155 mmol) in dry CH2C12 (1.5 mL) was added diethylamine (265 mg, 375 μί, 3.62 mmol), and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. Then, more diethylamine (318 mg, 450 μί, 4.35 mmol) was added to the reaction, and the reaction mixture stirred for 3 additional hours followed by LC-MS. After completion of the reaction the solvent was concentrated. The crude product was purified via preparatory TLC (CHC13: EtOAc: hexane: NH3/ MeOH at 2: 1 :2:0.5) to afford I-l (5.7 mg, 70%). JNMR (500 MHz, CDC13) δ 8.26 (s, 1H), 7.02 (s, 1H), 6.98 (s, 1H), 5.98 (s, 2H), 5.50 (br s, 2H), 4.26 (t, J= 6.8 Hz, 2H), 2.73 (m, 1H), 2.57 ( t, J= 6.8 Hz, 2H), 2.02 (m, 2H), 1.05 (d, J = 10.6 Hz, 6H), 0.28 (s, 9H); MS m/z 551.24 (M+H) +; 549.11 (M-H)~. LCMS found 551.4 [M+H]+. Comparative cost analysis for the synthesis of Compound I-l [0128] In Method 1, when 1 was directly subjected to conditions that were previously used for Boc-protected 2, the desired product I-l in was obtained in 41%> yield. Similarly, when Fmoc-protected PU-H71 2-2 was subjected to similar conditions 2-3 was obtained in 56%> yield. Compared to the Method 1, Method 2 requires two additional steps, installation and removal of the Fmoc group, at yields of 88%> and 70%>, respectively. The overall yield for Method 2 is 34%> (0.88 x 0.56 x 0.70 x 100%) which is comparable to Method 1. [0129] [124I] - Nal costs per mCi ~ $225, and a typical patient dose = 5-11 mCi/study. To carry out the radiolabeling as depicted in Scheme A using a Boc precursor, the typical isolated yields are 40-50%> and requires 2 or more hours of radiochemistry time (~ $300), producing inconsistent results. In contrast, using compound I-l as in Methods 1 and 2 above produces typical isolated yields in the range of 60-70%) (i.e., 2 mCi of material saved), with radiochemistry time down to 30 min. or less. Moreover, these methods are more reliable and reproducible, which is highly desirable in clinical applications. Thus, the total savings per dose are currently estimated to be about $725 compared to the current methods. Method 1 offers the additional advantage of requiring fewer steps to produce compound I-l, which results in additional savings as compared to both Method 2 and the existing chemistry depicted A. Example 3 Radiolabelin of compounds of Formula I 1-1 [0130] To a solution of 25 μΐ of compound 1-1 (1.0 μg/μL in methanol) in Eppendorf was added [131I]-NaI solution (0.4 mCi in 4 uL in 0.1N NaOH) and the solution was vortexed. To this solution, 2 μΐ^ of chloramine-T (2 mg /ml acetic acid) was added and the reaction mixture was vortexed and allowed to react for 1 min. The crude product was purified by passing through a C-18 column (Phenomenex, Luna 250 x 4.6 mm, 5 μ, 110 A), using 20 % B (A = 0.1% TFA; B = 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile) as the eluant with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The product has a retention time of about 12 minutes, under the conditions described above was collected and used for further studies. The yield for this reaction averages in the range of 60-70%. Alternative purification procedure [0131] Precondition Sep-Pak® Classic C18 cartridge (360mg 55-105μιη) with 10 mL of ethanol and followed by 20 mL of water.
