Example 4: compound (23) in table I
2-methoxy-5-nitrophenol (254 mg, 1.5 mmol, 1 eq.) was placed in dimethylformamide (3 mL) with 4-(2-chloro-ethyl)morpholine hydrochloride (837 mg, 4.5 mmol, 3 eq.), Cs2CO3 (3.4 g, 10.7 mmol, 7 eq.), KI (547 mg, 3.3 mmol, 2.2 eq.). The reaction mixture was heated at 80Â°C and stirred for 20 hours. The reaction mixture was then concentrated under reduced pressure and the resulting residue was diluted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with a 1% NaOH aqueous solution, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel to afford 4-(2-(2-methoxy-5-nitrophenoxy)ethyl)morpholine (386 mg, 91%).
