In an embodiment of this invention, especially the preferable compound I-85 and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, e.g., hydrochlorate, i.e., compound II-85. The corresponding chemical structure is illustrated as follows. In vitro animal experiment suggested that, compound II-2 could relax vascular smooth muscles constricted by adrenaline and high potassium concentration, with −log EC50 values of relaxation of 5.73±0.03 and 5.34±0.02, respectively (FIG. 1 and FIG. 2). Compound II-3 could relax vascular smooth muscles constricted by adrenaline and high potassium concentration, with −log EC50 values of relaxation of 6.01±0.05 and 5.49±0.05, respectively (FIG. 8 and FIG. 9). It was indicated in a study on dilating mechanism of compound II-2 on vascular smooth muscle that, the compound could competitively resist the vasoconstrictive effects of noradrenaline, calcium ions and hydroxytryptamine, move the dose effect curve of above said agonist transversally to right, while maximal response was not reduced, suggesting that PA2 values for the compound to resist vasoconstrictive effects of noradrenaline (NA), calcium ions and hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were 7.37±0.08 (7.52±0.04 for doxazosin), 5.61±0.04 (6.99±0.05 for amlodipine) and 5.71±0.08 (FIGS. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7). The results indicated that, compound II-2 produced vasodilative effects by blocking α1 receptor, Ca2+ ion channel and vascular 5-HT2A receptor. In vitro animal experiment suggested that, compound II-29 could relax vascular smooth muscles constricted by adrenaline and high potassium concentration, with −log EC50 values of relaxation of 6.01±0.02 and 5.64±0.01, respectively (FIG. 15 and FIG. 16). Compound II-31 could relax vascular smooth muscles constricted by adrenaline and high potassium concentration, with −log EC50 values of relaxation of 6.19±0.03 and 5.55±0.03, respectively (FIG. 10 and FIG. 11). It was indicated in a study on dilating mechanism of compound II-31 on vascular smooth muscle that, the compound could competitively resist the vasoconstrictive effects of noradrenaline, calcium ions and hydroxytryptamine, move the dose effect curve of above said agonist transversally to right, while maximal response was not reduced, suggesting that PA2 values for the compound to resist vasoconstrictive effects of noradrenaline, calcium ions and hydroxytryptamine were 6.02±0.13 (7.76±0.24 for doxazosin), 6.56±0.032 (7.51±0.288 for amlodipine) and 6.726±0.089 (FIGS. 12, 13 and 14). These results indicated that, compound II-31 produced vasodilative effects by blocking α1 receptor, Ca2+ ion channel and vascular 5-HT2A receptor. In in vivo bulk testing on rats, compound II-2 showed good hypotensive effects, good oral absorption, mild toxicity, great therapeutic index, negative marrow micronucleus test, with protential value in development of multiple target vasodilative drugs. The vivo bulk testing on hypotensive effects in rats indicated that, compound II-85 had obvious hypotensive effects, good oral absorption, relatively mild acute toxicity, greater therapeutic index, negative marrow micronucleus test, with protential values in development of vasodilative drugs, especially new hypotensive drugs. The inventor found that, the said compound in formula (I) and its salts acceptably pharmaceutically in this invention have obvious relaxing effects on vascular smooth muscles of subjects. The said compound in formula (I) and its salts acceptable pharmaceutically in this invention may produce relaxing effects on vascular smooth muscles by antagonism against a receptors (especially α1 receptors). In addition, compound in formula (I) and its salts acceptably pharmaceutically in this invention may achieve relaxing effects on vascular smooth muscles by acting on other targets or approaches, e.g., Ca2+ channel blockade or antagonism against 5-HT2A receptors. Compounds with multiple targets in this invention are particularly preferable, e.g., compound I-2 or II-2, compound I-85 or II-85. With multiple targets, compounds in this invention are particularly effective against diseases related with persistent and pathological vascular constriction or spasm of vascular smooth muscle. When the compounds are used in combination with one or more single target drugs against the said diseases, higher efficacy may be achieved, or drug resistance or undesireble side effects may be effectively reduced, thus improving safety. Specifically, because of multiple target effects, when α1 receptor of vascular smooth muscle is incompletely blocked, good hypotensive efficacy may be produced by synergistically blocking Ca2+ channel and/or 5-HT2A receptor, then the remaining α1 receptors could still participate in pressor reflex, which may prevent and reduce the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension. And/or by blocking Ca2+ channel, in addition to synergistic hypotensive effects, effects may be produced to resist myocardial hypertrophy, protect vascular endothelia, resist atherosclerosis, inhibit hyperplasia of vascular smooth muscle, and improve cerebral blood circulation, and prevent occurrence of first dose effect by reducing heart rate, effectively preventing tachycardia and palpitation. And/or by blocking 5-HT2A receptors, in addition to synergistic hypotensive effects, the drug combination may effectively improve blood supply to patients with occlusion vascular diseases, then the compound may be used to hypertension patients with atherosclerosis and endothelial injuries. Therefore, compound in formula (I) and the salts acceptable pharmaceutically in this invention may be used to prevent, alleviate or treat subjects with diseases or symptoms related with persistent and pathological constriction or vascular spasm.

Then K-H solution was used to flush the sample repeatedly, after balanced for 1 hour, compound II-2 (3×10−7 mol/L) was added. NA was also added by using the same method 20 min later. The maximal response was considered 100%, NA constriction percentage was used as Y axis, negative logarithms of different concentrations were used as X axis to draw dose effective curve. The curve was shown in FIG. 3 after compound II-2 (3×10−7 mol/L) was added. NA dose effective curve was obviously moved to right in parallel, with maximal response nearly unchanged. Percentages at different concentrations were statistically analyzed by using t test, most P values <0.01, suggesting significant difference.
