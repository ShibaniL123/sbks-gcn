SUMMARY OF INVENTION Technical Problem The invention is to provide a chiral compound having large helical twisting power (HTP), a low melting point and good compatibility with other liquid-crystal compounds; and a liquid-crystal composition having an optically isotropic liquid-crystal phase composed of the chiral compound and an achiral liquid-crystal component, and according to the invention, having a low drive voltage and good storage stability. Solution to Problem An optically isotropic liquid-crystal composition contains a chiral compound and an achiral liquid-crystal component. In general, as HTP of the chiral compound is larger, a helical pitch of a liquid-crystal can be shortened by adding a smaller amount of the chiral compound to a liquid-crystal composition. Therefore, an optically isotropic liquid-crystal phase is exhibited by adding a small amount of the chiral compound, and when the composition is used in the form of an optical element, an effect such as a decrease in drive voltage and suppression of precipitation of the chiral compound can be expected. The reason is that, in the optically isotropic liquid-crystal composition, the achiral liquid-crystal component contributes to the decrease in drive voltage, and a content of the achiral liquid-crystal component can be increased by using the chiral compound having large HTP. Moreover, the chiral compound having a low melting point and good compatibility results in allowing an improvement in compatibility of the optically isotropic liquid-crystal composition, and when the composition is used in the form of the optical element, the optical element can be driven in a wide temperature range including the low temperature. Moreover, also upon preparation of the optically isotropic liquid-crystal composition, time required for dissolution can be significantly shortened, and therefore the optical device can be efficiently manufactured, and thus manufacturing cost can be reduced. The present inventors have diligently continued to conduct research, and as a result, have found that the problem can be solved by using a 5,5′,6,6′,7,7′,8,8′-octahydro-1,1′-bi-2-naphthyl derivative as the chiral compound.

A maximum temperature of the nematic phase is a phase transition temperature between the nematic phase and an isotropic phase, and may be occasionally abbreviated simply as a clearing point or the maximum temperature.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows a comb-like electrode substrate used in Examples. FIG. 2 shows an optical system used in Examples. DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS 1 Optically Isotropic Liquid-Crystal Composition of the Invention A first embodiment of the invention is a liquid-crystal composition that can be used for a liquid-crystal device driven in an optically isotropic liquid-crystal phase. The optically isotropic liquid-crystal composition of the invention has a compound represented by formula (K1) described above as a chiral agent and an achiral liquid-crystal component. Here, chirality of the chiral agent may be present or absent. The compound contained in the liquid-crystal composition of the invention is generally prepared according to a publicly known method, for example, a method for allowing necessary components to react under a high temperature. Moreover, with regard to each element of the compound constituting the liquid-crystal composition used in the invention, an analog including an isotopic element can be used, as long as no significant difference in physical characteristics exists. 1.1 Optically Isotropic Liquid-Crystal Phase A liquid-crystal composition of the invention contains the optically isotropic liquid-crystal phase. Here, an expression “the liquid-crystal composition has optical isotropy” means that macroscopically, a liquid-crystal molecule sequence optically shows isotropy because the liquid-crystal molecule sequence is isotropic, but microscopically, a liquid-crystalline order exists. Then, “optically isotropic liquid-crystal phase” herein represents a phase exhibiting the optically isotropic liquid-crystal phase without fluctuation, and for example, a phase exhibiting a platelet tissue (blue phase in a narrow sense) is one example thereof. In general, the blue phase is classified into three kinds (blue phase I, blue phase II and blue phase III), and all of the three kinds of blue phases are optically active and isotropic. Two or more kinds of diffracted light beams due to Bragg reflection from different lattice planes in the blue phases of blue phase I and blue phase II are observed. In the optically isotropic liquid-crystal composition of the invention, in order to exhibit the optically isotropic liquid-crystal phase, a helical pitch based on a microscopically included liquid-crystalline order (hereinafter, simply referred to as “pitch” in several cases) is preferably 1,000 nanometers or less. Electric birefringence in the optically isotropic liquid-crystal phase becomes larger as the pitch becomes longer, and thus as long as desired optical characteristics (transmittance, diffraction wavelength or the like) are satisfied, the electric birefringence can be increased by adjusting a kind and a content of the chiral agent and setting a long pitch. Moreover, “non-liquid-crystal isotropic phase” herein means an isotropic phase defined in general, namely, a disorder phase, and the isotropic phase in which even when a region whose local order parameter is not zero is formed, a cause thereof depends on fluctuation. For example, an isotropic phase exhibited on a high temperature side of the nematic phase corresponds to the non-liquid-crystal isotropic phase herein. A similar definition is to be applied to a chiral liquid-crystal herein. 1.2 Chiral Compound 1.2.1 Chiral Compound (K1) and (K2) A chiral compound contained in the liquid-crystal composition of the invention is a compound represented by formula (K1) or (K2).

In general, when X11 the refractive index anisotropy or the dielectric anisotropy is large, the liquid-crystal device of the invention tends to have a low voltage, and when the viscosity is low, a response speed becomes high. In general, when X11 is fluorine, chlorine, —C≡N, —N═C═S, —SF5, —CF3, —CHF2, —CH2F, —OCF3, —OCHF2 or —OCH2F, the dielectric anisotropy of compound (1-A) is large.

Moreover, a third embodiment of the invention includes an optically isotropic polymer-liquid-crystal composite material. For example, the material can be manufactured by performing a polymerization reaction in the mixture containing the optically isotropic liquid-crystal composition and the polymerizable monomer of the second embodiment of the invention. 2.1 Polymerization Conditions Upon Manufacture of Polymer-Liquid-Crystal Composite Material The optically isotropic polymer-liquid-crystal composite material in the third embodiment of the invention is not particularly limited, if the composite material contains both of a liquid-crystal material and a polymer compound, but the composite material may be in a state in which the polymer is partially or wholly not dissolved into the liquid-crystal material, and in a state in which the polymer is subjected to phase separation from the liquid-crystal material. The polymer-liquid-crystal composite material of the invention can also be manufactured by mixing an optically isotropic liquid-crystal composition and a polymer obtained by being previously polymerized, but is preferably manufactured by mixing a low molecular weight monomer, a macromonomer, an oligomer or the like (hereinafter, collectively referred to as “monomer or the like”) serving as a material of the polymer, and the optically isotropic liquid-crystal composition, and then performing the polymerization reaction in the resulting mixture. In the second embodiment of the invention in which the mixture contains the monomer or the like and the liquid-crystal composition, the mixture containing the optically isotropic liquid-crystal composition and the polymerizable monomer is also referred to as “polymerizable monomer-liquid-crystal mixture” herein. “Polymerizable monomer-liquid-crystal mixture” may contain, when necessary, a polymerization initiator, a curing agent, a catalyst, a stabilizer, a dichroic dye (merocyanine, styryl, azo, azomethine, azoxy, quinophthalone, anthraquinone, tetrazine dye or the like), a photochromic compound or the like as described below within the range in which advantageous effects of the invention are not adversely affected. For example, the polymerizable monomer-liquid-crystal mixture of the invention may contain, when necessary, the polymerization initiator in an amount of 0.1 to 20 parts by weight based on the polymerizable monomer. The polymerization in the mixture is preferably performed in the mixture in the non-liquid-crystal isotropic phase or the optically isotropic liquid-crystal phase. More specifically, a polymerization temperature is preferably a temperature at which the polymer-liquid-crystal composite material shows high transparency and isotropy. The polymerization is further preferably terminated at a temperature at which the mixture of the monomer and the liquid-crystal material exhibits the non-liquid-crystal isotropic phase or the blue phase, and in the non-liquid-crystal isotropic phase or the optically isotropic liquid-crystal phase. More specifically, the temperature is preferably adjusted to a level at which the polymer-liquid-crystal composite material, after the polymerization, causes no substantial scattering of light on a side of a wavelength longer than a wavelength of visible light and an optically isotropic state is exhibited. 2.2 Polymer Raw Material Constituting Composite Material As a polymer raw material constituting the composite material of the invention, for example, the low molecular weight monomer, the macromonomer or the oligomer can be used, and a polymer raw material monomer herein is used in the meaning of including the low molecular weight monomer, the macromonomer and the oligomer. Moreover, the resulting polymer preferably has three-dimensional crosslinked structure, and therefore a polyfunctional monomer having two or more polymerizable functional groups is preferably used as the polymer raw material monomer. The polymerizable functional group is not particularly limited, but specific examples increase an acryl group, a methacryl group, a glycidyl group, an epoxy group, an oxetanyl group and a vinyl group. From a viewpoint of a rate of polymerization, an acryl group and a methacryl group are preferred. In the polymer raw material monomer, in a case where a monomer having two or more polymerizable functional groups is contained in an amount of 10% by weight or more, high transparency and isotropy are easily exhibited in the composite material of the invention, and therefore such a case is preferred. Moreover, in order to obtain a preferred composite material, a polymer having a mesogen moiety is preferred, and as the polymer raw material monomer, a raw material monomer having the mesogen moiety can be partially or wholly used therefor. 2.2.1 Monofunctional or Bifunctional Monomer Having Mesogen Moiety A monofunctional or bifunctional monomer having the mesogen moiety is not particularly limited in structure.

The polymerization initiator can be used for the purpose of accelerating generation of the active species. For example, light or heat can be used for generation of the active species. In formulas (M1) and (M2), AM is each independently an aromatic or non-aromatic 5-membered ring or 6-membered ring, or a condensed ring having 9 or more carbons, but —CH2— in the ring may be replaced by —O—, —S—, —NH— or —NCH3—, and —CH═ in the ring may be replaced by —N═, and a hydrogen atom on the ring may be replaced by halogen and alkyl having 1 to 5 carbons or alkyl halide.

In consideration of stability of the compound, —CH2—O—CH2—O— in which oxygen and oxygen are not adjacent to each other is preferred to —CH2—O—O—CH2— in which oxygen and oxygen are adjacent to each other. Above all, specific examples of particularly preferred AM include 1,4-cyclohexylene, 1,4-cyclohexenylene, 1,4-phenylene, 2-fluoro-1,4-phenylene, 2,3-difluoro-1,4-phenylene, 2,5-difluoro-1,4-phenylene, 2,6-difluoro-1,4-phenylene, 2-methyl-1,4-phenylene, 2-trifluoromethyl-1,4-phenylene, 2,3-bis(trifluoromethyl)-1,4-phenylene, naphthalene-2,6-diyl, tetrahydronaphthalene-2,6-diyl, fluorene-2,7-diyl, 9-methylfluorene-2,7-diyl, 1,3-dioxane-2,5-diyl, pyridine-2,5-diyl, and pyrimidine-2,5-diyl. In addition, in a configuration of 1,4-cyclohexylene and 1,3-dioxane-2,5-diyl as described above, trans is preferred to cis. Then, 2-fluoro-1,4-phenylene is structurally identical with 3-fluoro-1,4-phenylene, and thus the latter is not exemplified. The above rule is also applied to a relationship between 2,5-difluoro-1,4-phenylene and 3,6-difluoro-1,4-phenylene, or the like. In formulas (M1) and (M2), YM is each independently a single bond or alkylene having 1 to 20 carbons, and in the alkylene, at least one of —CH2— may be replaced by —O—, —S—, —CH═CH—, —C≡C—, —COO— or —OCO—, but a case where two oxygen atoms are adjacent, such as —O—O—, is excluded.

The liquid-crystal composition shows a low drive voltage and a short response time, and therefore is effective in achieving a low voltage drive and a high speed response of the optical element. EXAMPLES The invention will be further specifically described by way of Examples below, but the invention is in no way limited by the Examples. In Examples herein, I represents a non-liquid-crystal isotropic phase, N represents a nematic phase, N* represents a chiral nematic phase, BP represents a blue phase, and BPX represents an optically isotropic liquid-crystal phase in which diffracted light having two or more colors are not observed. An I-N phase transition point herein is referred to as an N-I point in several cases. An I-N* transition point is referred to as an N*-I point in several cases. An I-BP phase transition point is referred to as a BP-I point in several cases. In Examples herein, unless otherwise noted, measurement and calculation of values of physical properties or the like were carried out by the methods described in EIAJ ED-2521A as the Standard of Electronic Industries Association of Japan. Specific measuring methods, calculating methods and so forth other than the methods of measurement of an elastic constant and dielectric anisotropy and measurement of refractive index anisotropy above were as described below. (1) I-N Phase Transition Point (TNI) A sample was put on a hot plate in a melting point apparatus equipped with a polarizing microscope, and in a state of a crossed nicol, the sample was first heated to a temperature at which the sample was changed to a non-liquid-crystal isotropic phase, and then cooled at a rate of 1° C. per minute to allow a chiral nematic phase or an optically anisotropic phase to completely appear. A phase transition temperature in a process thereof was measured, and then the sample was heated at a rate of 1° C. per minute, and a phase transition temperature in a process thereof was measured. When discrimination of the phase transition point was difficult in a dark field under the crossed nicol in the optically isotropic liquid-crystal phase, a polarizing plate was shifted by 1 to 10 degrees from the state of the crossed nicol, and then the phase transition temperature was measured. (2) Refractive Index (n∥ and n⊥; Measured at 25° C.) Measurement was carried out by an Abbe refractometer with a polarizing plate mounted on an ocular by using light at a wavelength of 589 nanometers. A surface of a main prism was rubbed in one direction (rubbing), and then a sample was added dropwise onto the main prism. A refractive index (n∥) was measured when the direction of polarized light was parallel to the direction of the rubbing. A refractive index (n⊥) was measured when the direction of polarized light was perpendicular to the direction of the rubbing. (3) Pitch (P; Measured at 25° C.; nm) A pitch length was measured by using selective reflection (Ekisho Binran, page 196 (Maruzen Co., Ltd., issued in 2000). In a selective reflection wavelength Δ, a relational expression: <n>p/Δ=1 holds, in which <n> represents an average refractive index, and is given by the following formula: <n>={(n∥2+n⊥2)/2}1/2. The selective reflection wavelength was measured by a microspectrophotometer (trade name FE-3000, Otsuka Electronics Co., Ltd.). A pitch was determined by dividing the resulting reflection wavelength by the average refractive index. With regard to the pitch of a cholesteric liquid-crystal having a reflection wavelength in a long wavelength region or a short wavelength region of visible light, and the cholesteric liquid-crystal difficult measurement of which was difficult, the pitch was determined by adding a chiral compound at a concentration (concentration C′) at which a sample had the selective reflection wavelength in a visible light region to measure a selective reflection wavelength (λ′), and an original selective reflection wavelength (λ) was calculated from an original chiral concentration (concentration C) according to a linear extrapolation method (λ=λ′×C′/C). (4) HTP (Helical Twisting Power) (25° C.; μm−1) HTP was given by using values of the average refractive index <n> and the pitch as determined by the method described above according to the following expression: HTP=<n>/(λ·C), in which λ represents a selective reflection wavelength (nm) and C represents a chiral concentration (% by weight). A ratio (percentage) of a component or a liquid-crystal compound was expressed in terms of weight percentage (% by weight) based on the total weight of the liquid-crystal compound. The composition was prepared by measuring a weight of the component of the liquid-crystal compound or the like and then by mixing the components. Therefore, calculation of % by weight of the component is easy. Example 1 Synthesis of Compound (K122-S1) of the Invention (in compound (K122), a compound in which nk1=nk2=0, n=0 and Rk2=C4H9.)
