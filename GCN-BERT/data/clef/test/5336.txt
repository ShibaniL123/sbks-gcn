In the present method, for example, Compound (1) and Compound (A) may be separately made into formulations by the method described above and the like and further diluted with water as needed, and a mixture obtained by mixing the formulations or dilutions can be used. In the present method, another one or more fungicides or insecticides can be mixed and applied. As the fungicides and insecticides, known ones can be used. Specifically, the methods for treating crops in the present method include a treatment to crop foliage such as foliage application, a treatment to crop cultivation areas such as soil treatment, a treatment to crop seeds such as seed disinfection, and the like. Examples of the treatments to crop foliage in the present method include treatment methods in which a formulation is applied to crop surfaces, such as foliage application and trunk application. As treatment methods in which a crop before planting out is allowed to directly absorb a formulation, a method of immersing the whole crop or the root part is mentioned. A formulation obtained by using a solid carrier such as mineral powders can be attached to the root part. Examples of treatments to crop cultivation areas in the present method include application to soils, soil incorporation and soil drenching with chemicals (irrigation of chemical liquids, soil injection, dripping of chemical liquids), and examples of places to be treated include planting holes, furrows, around planting holes, around furrows, the whole surface of cultivation areas, parts adjacent to soils in plants, the spaces between roots, under trunks, ridges between trunks, ridging, seedling boxes, seedling trays, seedbeds and the like, and times to be treated include before sowing, at the time of sowing, immediately after sowing, in the seedling stage, before planting, at the time of planting, in the growing stage after planting (the initial flowering stage, the full flowering stage, the final flowering stage and the reproductive stage) and the like. In the treatments to crop cultivation areas, crops and soils can be simultaneously treated with active components, and a solid fertilizer such as a paste fertilizer containing active components can be also applied to soils. Active components can be mixed with irrigation liquids, and examples thereof include injection into irrigation equipment (irrigation tube, irrigation pipe, sprinkler etc.), mixing into a flooding liquid between furrows, mixing into hydroponic water and the like. An irrigation liquid and active component can be mixed in advance to be used for the treatment using proper irrigation methods such as the irrigation methods mentioned above and other methods such as water spray and flooding, for example. The treatments to crop seeds in the present method are, for example, a method for treating crop seeds, bulbs and the like with the present composition, and examples thereof include spray treatments in which a suspension of Compound (1) and Compound (A) is sprayed in the form of mist on seed surfaces or bulb surfaces, smear treatments in which, for example, a wettable powder, an emulsifiable concentrate or a flowable of Compound (1) and Compound (A) is applied to seeds or bulbs after adding a small amount of water or directly, and immersion treatments in which seeds are immersed in a solution of Compound (1) and Compound (A) for a certain period of time, film coating treatments, and pellet coating treatments. The amounts of Compound (1) and Compound (A) applied vary depending on the kind of crop to be treated, the kind of plant disease to be prevented and the occurrence frequency thereof, formulation forms, application time, application methods, places to be applied, weather conditions and the like, and, when treating crop foliage or when treating cultivation areas, the total amount of Compound (1) and Compound (A) (hereinafter, referred to as “the amount of active components”) is usually 1 to 500 g, preferably 2 to 200 g and more preferably 10 to 100 g per 1000 m2. In the treatments to seeds, the amount of active components is usually 0.001 to 10 g and preferably 0.01 to 1 g per kilogram of seeds. Emulsifiable concentrates, wettable powders, suspending agents and the like are usually diluted with water and sprayed. In this case, the concentration of the amount of active components is usually 0.0005 to 2% by weight and preferably 0.005 to 1% by weight. Dusts, granules and the like are usually treated without dilution. The present method is applied to the “crops” mentioned below.

EXAMPLES The present invention will now be described in more detail byway of formulation examples and a test example thereof. It should be noted, however, that the present invention is not limited only to the following examples. Unless otherwise specified, in the following examples, parts indicate parts by weight. Formulation Example 1 Five parts of Compound (1), 5 parts of Compound (A), 35 parts of a mixture of white carbon and polyoxyethylene alkyl ether sulfate ammonium salt (weight ratio 1:1) and 5 parts of water are mixed and the obtained mixture is pulverized by a wet grinding method to obtain each flowable formulation. Formulation Example 2 Ten parts of Compound (1), 5 parts of Compound (A), 1.5 parts of sorbitan trioleate and 28 parts of aqueous solution containing 2 parts of polyvinyl alcohol are mixed and the obtained mixture is pulverized by a wet grinding method, and 45.50 parts of aqueous solution containing 0.05 parts of xanthan gum and 0.1 parts of aluminum magnesium silicate are then added thereto. Further, 10 parts of propylene glycol are added thereto and the obtained mixture is stirred and mixed to obtain a flowable formulation. Formulation Example 3 Ten parts of Compound (1), 40 parts of Compound (A), 3 parts of calcium lignin sulfonate, 2 parts of sodium lauryl sulfate, and 45 parts of synthetic hydrated silicon dioxide are well ground and mixed to obtain each wettable powder. Test Example 1 Seeds of rapeseed were sown at a density of 3.5 kg/hectare on Sep. 3, 2010 and raised. A 25% flowable formulation of Compound (1) and tebuconazole (: Horizon (registered trademark) 25% EW) were diluted with water. These were mixed to prepare a composition so that Compound (1) and tebuconazole might be each 150 g/hectare. The foliage of rapeseed in the full flowering stage (growth stage BBCH 65 (Biologische Bundesanstalt Bundessortenamt and Chemical industry (BBCH-scale))) was treated with the composition on May 19, 2011. The amount treated was 200 L/hectare. The test area was 3×8 m, and a test zone treated with the chemical by the operation mentioned above was referred to as a treated zone. Meanwhile, a test zone with the same test area which was not treated with the chemical was referred to as a non-treated zone. Seeds of the rapeseed were harvested on Aug. 9, 2011, and the yield per hectare was investigated. The water content of the rapeseed seeds as the target of the investigation was considered to be 9%. As a result, a yield of 4.3 ton/hectare was obtained in the treated zone, while in the non-treated zone, the yield was 3.8 ton/hectare. During the test period, the occurrence of insect pests which can affect yields was not observed.
