Synthesis of Compound 57
Compound 56 (26.0 mg, 0.10 mmol) was stirred in CHCl3 (10 mL), maleic anhydride (28.1 mg, 0.11 mmol) was added to the mixture. The reaction was heated to reflux for 12 hours. After cooled to room temperature, solid product precipitated was filtered and washed with CHCl3 (30 mLÃ—3) to afford the compound 57 (20.1 mg, 59.1%) as a white solid. LC-MS m/z (ES+), 356.14 (M+H)+.
