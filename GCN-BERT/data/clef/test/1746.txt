Example 1: Manufacture of Compound No. 91
530.9 g (3.89 mol) of a 33% ethylamine aqueous solution and 398 g (3.33 mol) of trichloromethane were loaded into a 2 L 4-necked flask and cooled to about 6° C. 200 g (1.11 mol) of a 40% 1-methylglyoxal (pyruvaldehyde) aqueous solution was added dropwise to this solution at a liquid temperature of 6 to 8° C. for 1.5 hours. After the end of the dropping, the mixture was stirred at a liquid temperature of 6 to 8° C. for 3.5 hours. Thereafter, the reaction solution was allowed to stand and the organic layer was separated. Further, the aqueous layer was extracted twice with trichloromethane (100 g), and the organic layer was recovered. All the organic layers were combined, dehydrated with sodium sulfate (an appropriate amount) and filtered, and the solvent was removed at an oil bath temperature of 60 to 70° C. under a slightly reduced pressure. Thereafter, distillation was performed at an oil bath temperature of 70° C. under a reduced pressure. The obtained fraction was a pale yellow transparent liquid. The yield was 67.0 g and the percentage yield was 47.8%.
