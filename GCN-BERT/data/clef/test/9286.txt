Botanical designation: Hydrangea macrophylla. Cultivar denomination: ‘SMHMP1’. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct Hydrangea plant, botanically known as Hydrangea macrophylla and hereinafter referred to by the name ‘SMHMP1’. The new Hydrangea plant is a product of a planned breeding program conducted by the Inventor in Grand Haven, Mich. The objective of the breeding program was to develop new Hydrangea plants with new and unique flower types. The new Hydrangea plant originated from an open-pollination during the summer of 2007 of Hydrangea macrophylla ‘Harbits’, disclosed in U.S. Plant Pat. No. 21,186, as the female, or seed parent with an unknown selection of Hydrangea macrophylla as the male, or pollen, parent. The new Hydrangea plant was discovered and selected by the Inventor as a single flowering plant from within the progeny of the stated open-pollination in a controlled environment in Grand Haven, Mich. in 2009. Asexual reproduction of the new Hydrangea plant by softwood cuttings in a controlled environment in Grand Haven, Mich. since July, 2009 has shown that the unique features of this new Hydrangea plant are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations of asexual reproduction. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Plants of the new Hydrangea have not been observed under all possible environmental conditions and cultural practices. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environmental conditions such as temperature and light intensity without, however, any variance in genotype. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘SMHMP1’. These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘SMHMP1’ as a new and distinct Hydrangea plant: 1. Upright and mounded plant habit.2. Strong and sturdy stems.3. Glossy dark green-colored leaves.4. Large mophead-type inflorescences with large sterile flowers with two whorls of bright pink-colored sepals. Plants of the new Hydrangea differ from plants of the female parent, ‘Harbits’, in the following characteristics: 1. Plants of the new Hydrangea are more compact than plants of ‘Harbits’.2. Plants of the new Hydrangea have glossier leaves than plants of ‘Harbits’.3. Plants of the new Hydrangea have mophead-type inflorescences whereas plants of ‘Harbits’ have lacecap-type inflorescences.4. Plants of the new Hydrangea and ‘Harbits’ differ in sterile flower color as plants of the new Hydrangea have bright pink-colored sepals whereas plants of ‘Harbits’ have white and red purple bi-colored sepals. Plants of the new Hydrangea can be compared to plants of Hydrangea serrata ‘RIE 09’, disclosed in U.S. Plant Pat. No. 16,613. In side-by-side comparisons, plants of the new Hydrangea differed primarily from plants of ‘RIE 09’ in the following characteristics: 1. Plants of the new Hydrangea had glossier leaves than plants of ‘RIE 09’.2. Plants of the new Hydrangea had mophead-type inflorescences whereas plants of ‘RIE 09’ had lacecap-type inflorescences.3. Sterile flowers of plants of the new Hydrangea had more intense pink-colored sepals than sterile flowers of plants of ‘RIE 09’. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS The accompanying colored photographs illustrate the unique appearance of the new Hydrangea plant showing the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photographs may differ from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description which accurately describe the colors of the new Hydrangea plant. The photograph on the first sheet comprises a side perspective view of a typical flowering plant of ‘SMHMP1’. The photograph on the second sheet is a close-up view of a typical flowering plant of ‘SMHMP1’. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION Plants used for the aforementioned photographs and the following description were grown during the summer in two-gallon containers in an outdoor shadehouse in Grand Haven, Mich. and under cultural practices typical of commercial Hydrangea production. Plants of the new Hydrangea were two years old when the photographs and description were taken. The soil pH level was about 5.2 when the photographs and description were taken. In the following description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart, 2001 Edition, except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used.
