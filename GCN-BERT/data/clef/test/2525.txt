BACKGROUND The invention is related to a clamping device for clamping a workpiece, in particular but not limited to a workpiece for constituting a catheter. The invention is also related to an installation comprising at least one of such a clamping device. Catheters are constituted with tubes of little diameter. A part of the tube should be stiff as the catheter has to be pushed in a vein of a patient, and a terminal part should be more flexible to be directed to a direction or a location for exerting an action. Thus it is known assemble two parts of the catheter, but having the same or different diameters, or in different materials. The materials are in general a thermoplastic resin. The two parts are issued from the assembling of two workpieces in abutment by welding or bonding. As it is important that there is no knifing or aggressive protrusion on the outer surface of the catheter, the workpieces are to be well aligned during the assembling. For that, it is known to use a clamping device to hold one of the workpieces, the clamping device comprising a mandrel having a central hole and a housing surrounding the mandrel. The device comprises means for compressing the mandrel. A workpiece in form of a tube is introduced in the central hole in a manner that when the mandrel is compressed, the inner diameter of the central hole is reduced and tight the part. An installation for assembling two workpieces comprises two clamping devices having mandrel with the same axis to align the two workpieces. Although this device allows a good alignment and assembling, the device has not good performances. The parts before the assembling must be introduced in the mandrel by a translation movement in axial direction, which can be long and tricky. Furthermore, the deformation of the mandrel induces slipping between the mandrel and the part, and thus wearing of the mandrel. Thus the mandrel has to be changed frequently. SUMMARY It is an object of the invention to provide a clamping device allowing a quick clamping of a part and avoiding wear of the device. It is another object of the invention to provide an installation for assembling workpieces. With these aims in mind, the object of the invention is a clamping device for clamping a workpiece having a constant section, comprising: a base; a head; a couple of jaws comprising a lower jaw fixed to the base and an upper jaw facing the lower jaw and fixed to the head; guiding means to link the head to the base, and allowing the displacement of the head in an action direction between a clamping position, wherein the jaws define a clamping space having a constant section between them to tight the workpiece, and an opening position wherein the jaws are opened, allowing the lateral insertion of the workpiece between the jaws; the guiding means comprising at least two plates parallel one with the other, each plate being linked at a first end to a heel of the base, and to the head at a second end opposed to the first end, the first ends and second ends being flexible to allow the plates to pivot in relation to respectively the heel and the head; the clamping device being in one block of monolithic material such as metal. The guiding means allow that the head has a displacement keeping the same direction and near a translation, thus a circular translation. In fact, the heel, the head and the plates form a parallelogram which is deformable, keeping the head parallel to the heel and the plates parallel one with the other. As the clamping device comprises two jaws which can be distant in opening position, the workpiece can be inserted between the jaws, in a lateral movement which is simpler and speeder as the insertion in a hole. Furthermore, as the clamping device is in one block monolithic material, it is simpler to manufacture, in that there is no different pieces to assemble. Furthermore, the jaws being in metal, there is no need to change any part of the device, as the jaws are in metal, thus more wear resistant as elastomeric parts. The position of the workpiece is more precise as the jaws are stiff and the clamping movement does not induce any displacement of the workpiece. The profile of the clamping surfaces of the jaws can be adapted to the profile of the workpiece, so that the forces applied on the workpiece are well distributed and the pressure is low. The quality of the surface of the workpiece is preserved. The workpiece can be made of polymers, metal, glass or any fragile material. The clamping device is particularly adapted to clamp a piece in tubular form provided for manufacturing a catheter. In an embodiment, the head has linking means to allow action means to acting the head between the clamping position and the opening position. According to an improvement, the clamping device comprises balancing means to bias the head towards the opening position. The balancing means allow that the balance position of the guiding means is located between the clamping position and the opening position. Thus, the deformation of the flexible ends of plates is limited. If the balance position is at the middle of the extreme positions, the deformation is divided by two. According to the limit fatigue strain, this allows to reduce by two the length of the plates. In an embodiment, balancing means comprise at least a pin fixed on the base in the action direction and a spring surrounding the pin and acting between the base and the head. In an embodiment, the clamping device comprises a stop rod fixed on the base crossing the head through a hole, the stop rod having an abutment against which the head is stopped in the opening position. The stop rod can be a threaded rod of a screw and the abutment a head of this screw. Thus, the stiffness of the spring and the prestress against the abutment can be chosen independently from the opening position and according to conditions of operation of the device. In particular, the first or second end of the plate can comprise a weakening being less thick than the plate. The weakening being less thick, it is more flexible than the plate and thus, the flexion is located at the weakening. In particular, the first or second end of the plate can comprise an opening through the full thickness of the plate and a part of the width of the plate. Thus the ends are more flexible as the plate and thus, the flexion is located at the ends of the plates. According to a particular characteristic, the base comprises a main surface to fix the device on an installation, the main surface being perpendicular to the action direction, and wherein the base comprises a groove opened on the main surface and centered on the clamping space. Thus, the clamping device can be quickly fixed on an installation with a reproducible place. Different clamping devices, for example with different forms or dimensions of clamping space, can be installed successively on the same installation, the clamping space being always centered on the same axis. The workpiece is thus always on the same axis on the installation. The clamping device can comprise abutment means, the abutment means comprising a shoulder protruding from the lower jaw towards the upper jaw, and an abutment groove in the head, the shoulder being abutted in the abutment groove when the head is in the clamping position. The abutment means can avoid that the workpiece is crushed when clamped. The use of a shoulder and a groove allows deporting the surfaces in abutment. Furthermore, the shoulder helps stopping the workpiece when inserted in a radial direction according to the clamping space and guiding the workpiece towards its clamping position. According to another characteristic, the base comprises a tongue at an end opposed to the heel, to clamp the base on an installation. The invention concerns also an installation for working on a workpiece having a constant section, the installation comprising a structure, a tool device fixed on the structure, at least one clamping device for clamping the workpiece near the tool device, the clamping device comprising: a base fixed on the structure; a head; a couple of jaws comprising a lower jaw fixed to the base and an upper jaw facing the lower jaw and fixed to the head; guiding means to link the head to the base and allowing the displacement of the head in an action direction between a clamping position wherein the jaws define a clamping space having a constant section between them to tight the workpiece, and an opening position wherein the jaws are opened allowing the lateral insertion of the workpiece between the jaws; the guiding means comprising at least two plates parallel one with the other, each plate being linked at a first end to a heel of the base and to the head at a second end opposed to the first end, the first ends and second ends being flexible to allow the plates to pivot in relation to respectively the heel and the head; the clamping device being in one block of monolithic material such as metal. The clamping device allows clamping a workpiece on which an operation will occur with the help of the tool device on the same installation. Applications of the installation can be for instance inserting a mandrel in a tube, assembling a catheter or gluing two glass fibers. According to a characteristic, the installation comprises action means for each clamping device for acting the head between the clamping position and the opening position. For example, the action means comprise a jack acting on an upper surface of the head. According to an improvement, the base comprises a main surface to fix the device on the structure of the installation, the main surface being perpendicular to the action direction, wherein the base comprises a groove opened on the main surface and centered on the clamping space in cooperation with a protruding guide fixed on the structure. The invention is related also to an installation for assembling two workpieces, each workpiece having a constant section, the installation comprising a structure, an assembling tool device fixed on the structure, a first clamping device for clamping a first of the two workpieces, a second clamping device for clamping the second of the two workpieces near the tool device, each clamping device comprising: a base fixed on the structure; a head; a couple of jaws comprising a lower jaw fixed to the base and an upper jaw facing the lower jaw and fixed to the head; guiding means to link the head to the base and allowing the displacement of the head in an action direction between a clamping position wherein the jaws define a clamping space having a constant section between them to tight the workpiece, and an opening position wherein the jaws are opened allowing the lateral insertion of the workpiece between the jaws; the guiding means comprising at least two plates parallel one with the other, each plate being linked at a first end to a heel of the base and to the head at a second end opposed to the first end, the first ends and second ends being flexible to allow the plates to pivot in relation to respectively the heel and the head; the clamping device being in one block of monolithic material such as metal; the assembling tool device being located between the first and the second clamping devices, the installation comprising translation means to translate the second clamping device towards and outwards the first clamping device. Such an installation is adapted for manufacturing a catheter wherein two workpieces are clamped in alignment and in abutment. The assembling tool device performs a preparation of the ends of workpieces and then, the ends are abutted each against the other by the translation means.

The guiding means 33 comprise at least two plates 330 parallel one with the other, each plate 330 being linked at a first end 3301 to a heel 35 of the base 30 and to the head 31 at a second end 3302 opposed to the first end 3301. The first ends 3301 and second ends 3302 are flexible to allow the plates 330 to pivot in relation to respectively the heel 35 and the head 31. The clamping device 3 is in one block of metal. Action means like a pneumatic jack 7, are fixed on the respective support 5a, 5b for acting in the action direction F2. The head 31 has linking means 8 to allow the action means 7 to act the head 31 between the clamping position and the opening position. In this case, linking means 8 are the end of a mobile rod 80 of the jack 7 and a flat upper surface 81 of the head 31 on which the mobile rod 80 is acting.
