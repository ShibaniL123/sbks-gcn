FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical combination suitable for the treatment of cancer and other proliferative disorders. BACKGROUND Protein kinases are key regulators of essential cellular processes, and because they contain a distinct active site, thereby allowing compound binding, kinases are an attractive area for anti-cancer drug discovery [1]. However, it was not until the successful clinical development of imatinib, targeting BCR-ABL, that the first targeted protein kinase inhibitor became an approved cancer chemotherapeutic [2]. Currently protein kinases are a very active area for cancer drug discovery with many protein kinase families being the focus of drug development programs. Such discovery programs often target signalling pathways that become deregulated during tumour development. Members of the ErbB family, like many other growth factor receptors, dimerise upon ligand stimulation and undergo autophosphorylation through their cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domains. Once activated, the ErbB kinases transduce their signals via a number of cellular protein kinases, including ERK and PKB, to ultimately result in upregulation of Cyclin D1 levels leading to activation of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and the initiation of cellular proliferation [3]. Over-stimulation of ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase signalling has been documented in a number of different human cancers, including overexpression of HER2 (ErbB2) in up to 30% of breast cancer patients [4], while EGFR (ErbB1) is overexpressed in ovarian carcinomas (35-60%), head and neck tumours (70-100%) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; 50-90%) [5, 6]. Two main approaches have been pursued for the development of drugs that target the ErbB family. Humanised monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab and cetuximab bind to the HER2 and EGF receptors respectively, thereby blocking receptor dimerization/activation and facilitating removal of these proteins from the cell surface [3]. In contrast, erlotinib and gefitinib are small molecules that bind directly to the ATP-binding active site of the EGFR, blocking tyrosine kinase activity [7]. For each of these agents, the subsequent loss of mitogenic signalling results in the cessation of cellular proliferation. The CDKs are a second kinase family that have attracted a considerable amount of interest from a drug discovery perspective; with the three most advanced compounds, seliciclib (CYC202, R-roscovitine), alvocidib (flavopiridol) and SNS-032 (formerly BMS-387032) all currently in Phase II clinical development [8, 9]. Through their key role of phosphorylating proteins involved in the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints, CDKs control the orderly progression of the cell division cycle [8]. In cancer cells activation of CDKs by either overexpression of their cognate partners, the cyclins, or loss of the endogenous inhibitors such as p16 leads to inappropriate proliferation of cells that would normally be arrested and either repaired or induced to undergo apoptosis at specific cell cycle checkpoints [10]. In addition to controlling the cell cycle, some CDKs, such as CDK7 and CDK9, regulate transcription by phosphorylating the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. Seliciclib, alvocidib and SNS-032 all inhibit CDK7 and/or 9 thereby leading to the inhibition of transcription, and downregulation of proteins such as Mcl-1 and cyclin D1 [11, 12], which have short half-lives of approximately 3 h and 30 min respectively [13, 14]. The present invention seeks to provide new combinations that have therapeutic applications in the treatment of a range of proliferative disorders, more particularly cancer.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The preferred embodiments set out below are applicable to all the above-mentioned aspects of the invention. As mentioned above, the present invention relates to a combination comprising an ErbB inhibitor and a CDK inhibitor as set forth above. In one preferred embodiment, the ErbB inhibitor is an ErbB1 (EGFR) inhibitor. Preferably, the EGFR inhibitor is selected from AG1478, cetuximab, erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, panitumumab, matuzumab, nimotuzumab, zalutumumab, pertuzumab, canertinib, vandetanib, EKB-569, HKI-272, BIBW-2992, AEE-788, XL647, BMS-599626, PKI-116 and ARRY-334543. More preferably, the EGFR inhibitor is selected from AG1478, cetuximab, erlotinib, gefitinib and lapatinib. In another preferred embodiment, the ErbB inhibitor is an ErbB2 (Her2) inhibitor. More preferably, the ErbB2 inhibitor is trastuzumab. In one preferred embodiment, the ErbB inhibitor targets both Her2 and EGFR (for example, lapatinib, canertinib, EKB-569, HKI-272, BIBW-2992, AEE-788, XL647, BMS-599626, PKI-116 and ARRY-334543). In one preferred embodiment, the ErbB inhibitor is selected from AG1478, trastuzumab, cetuximab, erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, panitumumab, matuzumab, nimotuzumab, zalutumumab, pertuzumab, canertinib, vandetanib, EKB-569, HKI-272, BIBW-2992, AEE-788, XL647, BMS-599626, PKI-116, ARRY-334543. More preferably, the ErbB inhibitor is selected from AG1478, trastuzumab, cetuximab, erlotinib, gefitinib and lapatinib. In one particularly preferred embodiment, the EGFR inhibitor is AG1478. AG1478 [4-(3-chloroanilino)-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline] is a reversible, highly potent (IC50=3 nM) and selected inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity, commonly used as an EGF signalling blocker (www.alomone.com). The chemical structure of AG1478 is: In another particularly preferred embodiment, the ErbB inhibitor is trastuzumab. As mentioned above, trastuzumab (HerceptinÂ®) is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with high affinity in a cell-based assay (Kd=5 nM) to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 protein, HER2 (Coussens, L. et al., Science, 1985; 230: 1132-9; Slamon, D. J. et al., Science, 1989; 244:707-12). The antibody is an IgG1 kappa that contains human framework regions with the complementarity-determining regions of a murine antibody (4D5) that binds to HER2. For monotherapy, trastuzumab is indicated for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumours overexpress the HER2 protein and who have received one or more chemotherapy regimens for the metastatic disease. Trastuzumab has also been approved for use in combination with paclitaxel for treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer whose tumours overexpress the HER2 protein and who have not received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. Studies by the applicant investigated the effect of seliciclib and trastuzumab in combination in a breast cancer cell line that overexpresses the HER2 receptor. In addition, the interaction between seliciclib and the tyrphostin AG1478 was examined to determine whether synergy occurred between CDK inhibitors and small molecule inhibitors of the EGFR tyrosine kinase [18]. The results demonstrated that seliciclib synergised with trastuzumab in the breast cancer cell line SkBr3 that overexpresses HER2. Seliciclib also synergised with AG1478 in the NSCLC cell lines H358 and H1650 which express wild type and mutant EGFR respectively. In each case synergy involved inhibition of the HER2/EGFR signalling pathways. These in vitro findings were further expanded to demonstrate that the combination between seliciclib and erlotinib was synergistic in an H358 xenograft model. The data presented herein show that combinations between seliciclib and inhibitors of the ErbB receptor family can result in synergistic effects on cancer cell growth. In another particularly preferred embodiment, the EGFR inhibitor is cetuximab. Cetuximab is a recombinant, human/mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the extracellular domain of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Cetuximab is composed of the Fv regions of a murine anti-EGFR antibody with human IgG1 heavy and kappa light chain constant regions and has an approximate molecular weight of 152 kDa. Cetuximab is produced in mammalian (murine myeloma) cell culture. Cetuximab has been approved for use as a single agent and in combination with other regimens for the treatment of head and neck and colorectal cancers. In another particularly preferred embodiment, the EGFR inhibitor is erlotinib. Erlotinib [TarcevaÂ®; N-(3-ethynylphenyl-6,7-bis(2-methoxyethoxy)-4-quinazolin-amine] is a HER1/EGFR inhibitor and has the chemical structure: Erlotinib monotherapy has been approved for use for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after the failure of at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. In another particularly preferred embodiment, the EGFR inhibitor is gefitinib. Gefitinib [IressaÂ®; N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-7-methoxy-6-[(3,4-morpholin) propoxy]-4-quinazolinamine] has the chemical structure: Gefitinib has been approved for use as monotherapy for the continued treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after the failure of both platinum-based and docetaxel chemotherapies. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the ErbB inhibitor is lapatinib (TykerbÂ®). Lapatinib is the compound known as N-[3-chloro-4-[(3-fluorophenyl)methoxy]phenyl]-6-[5-[(2methylsulfonylethylamino)methyl]-2-furyl]quinazolin-4-amine, having the structure shown below: Lapatinib (INN) or lapatinib ditosylate (USAN), also known as GW572016, is an anti-cancer drug for the treatment of solid tumours such as breast and lung cancer. It has been approved for use in patients with advanced metastatic breast cancer in conjunction with the chemotherapy drug Xeloda. More specifically, lapatinib is a once-daily oral drug indicated for women who have received prior treatment with Herceptin and taxanes and anthracyclines. Lapatinib is an EGFR and HER2/neu (ErbB-2) dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor which binds to the intracellular phosphorylation domain to prevent receptor autophosphorylation upon ligand binding. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the ErbB inhibitor is selected from AG1478, trastuzumab and erlotinib. The combinations of the present invention comprise various purine-based CDK inhibitors, for example roscovitine and related compounds of general formula (I). Preferably, the CDK inhibitor of the presently claimed combination is most potent against CDK2. More preferably, the CDK inhibitor of the presently claimed combination is most potent against CDK2 and CDK9 with at least 20-fold less activity against CDK1 and CDK4. Even more preferably, the CDK inhibitor of the presently claimed combination is most potent against CDK2 and CDK9 with at least 50-fold less activity against CDK1 and CDK4. Even more preferably still, the CDK inhibitor of the presently claimed combination is most potent against CDK2 and CDK9 with at least 100-fold less activity against CDK4. In one highly preferred embodiment, the CDK inhibitor inhibits CDK2, CDK7 and CDK9 most potently, with at least 20-fold less activity against CDK1 and CDK4. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the CDK inhibitor is roscovitine or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Roscovitine or 2-[(1-ethyl-2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-6-benzylamine-9-isopropylpurine, is also described as 2-(1-D,L-hydroxymethylpropylamino)-6-benzylamine-9-isopropyl-purine. As used herein, the term âroscovitineâ encompasses the resolved R and S enantiomers, mixtures thereof, and the racemate thereof. As used herein, the term âseliciclibâ refers to the R enantiomer of roscovitine, namely, 2-(1-R-hydroxymethylpropylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-isopropylpurine, the structure of which is shown below. For all embodiments of the invention, preferably roscovitine is in the form of the R enantiomer, namely 2-(1-R-hydroxymethylpropylamino)-6-benzylamino-9-isopropyl-purine, hereinafter referred to as âseliciclibâ or âCYC202â or âR-roscovitineâ. The in vitro activity of roscovitine is as follows: Kinase IC50 (M) Cdk1/cyclin B 2.7 Cdk2/cyclin A 0.7 Cdk2/cyclin E 0.1 Cdk7/cyclin H 0.5 Cdk9/cyclin T1 0.8 Cdk4/cyclin D1 14.2 PKA >50 PKC >50 In another highly preferred embodiment, the CDK inhibitor is selected from: (3R)-3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-2-methyl-pentan-2-ol [1];(3S)-3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-2-methyl-pentan-2-ol [2];(2R3S)-3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-pentan-2-ol [3]; and(2R,3S-3-(6-((4,6-dimethylpyridin-3-ylmethylamino)-9-isopropyl-9H-purin-2-ylamino)pentan-2-ol [4]. In another preferred embodiment, the CDK inhibitor is 3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-2-methyl-pentan-2-ol. As used herein, 3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-2-methyl-pentan-2-ol encompasses the resolved R and S enantiomers, mixtures thereof, and the racemate thereof. In one highly preferred embodiment, the CDK inhibitor is (3R)-3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-2-methyl-pentan-2-ol [1], the structure of which is shown below: In another highly preferred embodiment, the CDK inhibitor is (3S)-3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-2-methyl-pentan-2-ol [2], the structure of which is shown below: In yet another preferred embodiment, the CDK inhibitor is 3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-pentan-2-ol. As used herein, 3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-pentan-2-ol encompasses the resolved, as well as the unresolved diastereoisomers, and mixtures thereof. In a highly preferred embodiment, the CDK inhibitor is (2R3S)-3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridine-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-pentan-2-ol [3], the structure of which is shown below: In yet another preferred embodiment, the CDK inhibitor is (2R,3S-3-(6-((4,6-dimethylpyridin-3-ylmethylamino)-9-isopropyl-9H-purin-2-ylamino)pentan-2-ol [4], the structure of which is shown below: Another aspect relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a combination according to the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient. Another aspect relates to a pharmaceutical product comprising the combination of the present invention for use in the treatment of a proliferative disorder. Many anti-cancer agents are given in combination in order to optimise the treatment regime. The effect of drug combinations is inherently unpredictable and there is often a propensity for one drug to partially or completely inhibit the effects of the other. The present invention is based on the surprising observation that administering a combination comprising an ErbB inhibitor (for example, an EGFR inhibitor), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a CDK inhibitor, either simultaneously, separately or sequentially, does not lead to any significant or dramatic adverse interaction between the two agents. The unexpected absence of any such antagonistic interaction is critical for clinical applications. Preferably, the combination of the invention is a synergistic combination comprising an ErbB inhibitor (for example, an EGFR inhibitor), and a CDK inhibitor as defined above, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, i.e. the combination has a synergistic effect. In a preferred embodiment, the combination of the ErbB inhibitor and the CDK inhibitor, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, produces an enhanced effect as compared to either drug administered alone. The surprising nature of this observation is in contrast to that expected on the basis of the prior art. Advantageously, a synergistic interaction may allow for lower doses of each component to be administered to a patient, thereby decreasing the toxicity of chemotherapy, whilst producing and/or maintaining the same therapeutic effect. Thus, in a particularly preferred embodiment, each component can be administered in a sub-therapeutic amount. In another preferred embodiment, the ErbB inhibitor and the CDK inhibitor, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, interact in a manner so as to alleviate or eliminate adverse side effects associated with the use of the individual components in monotherapy, or associated with their use in known combinations. As mentioned above, one aspect of the invention relates to a pharmaceutical product comprising an ErbB inhibitor and a CDK inhibitor, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, selected from: (a) roscovitine; (b) 3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-2-methyl-pentan-2-ol; (c) 3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-pentan-2-ol; and (d) (2R,3S-3-(6-((4,6-dimethylpyridin-3-ylmethylamino)-9-isopropyl-9H-purin-2-ylamino)pentan-2-ol as a combined preparation for simultaneous, sequential or separate use in therapy. The combination comprising the ErbB inhibitor and the CDK inhibitor, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may be administered simultaneously, sequentially or separately (as part of a dosing regime). As used herein, âsimultaneouslyâ is used to mean that the two agents are administered concurrently. Thus, administration âsequentiallyâ may permit one agent to be administered within 5 minutes, 10 minutes or a matter of hours after the other provided the circulatory half-life of the first administered agent is such that they are both concurrently present in therapeutically effective amounts. The time delay between administration of the components will vary depending on the exact nature of the components, the interaction therebetween, and their respective half-lives. In contrast to âsequentiallyâ, âseparatelyâ is used herein to mean that the gap between administering one agent and the other is significant i.e. the first administered agent may no longer be present in the bloodstream in a therapeutically effective amount when the second agent is administered. In one preferred embodiment, the second agent is administered at least 2 hours, more preferably at least 4 hours, even more preferably at least 8 hours, even more preferably still at least 12 or 24 or 48 or 72 hours after the first agent. In one particularly preferred embodiment, the second agent is administered at least 24 hours after the first agent. In one aspect, the present invention relates to a method of treating a proliferative disorder, said method comprising simultaneously, sequentially or separately administering to a subject an ErbB inhibitor and a CDK inhibitor, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, selected from: (a) roscovitine; (b) 3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-2-methyl-pentan-2-ol; (c) 3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-pentan-2-ol; and (d) (2R,3S-3-(6-((4,6-dimethylpyridin-3-ylmethylamino)-9-isopropyl-9H-purin-2-ylamino)pentan-2-ol. Preferably, the subject is a mammal, more preferably a human. In one preferred embodiment, the ErbB inhibitor and the CDK inhibitor, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt, are administered simultaneously. In another preferred embodiment, the ErbB inhibitor and the CDK inhibitor, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are administered sequentially or separately. Preferably, the ErbB inhibitor is administered at least 2 hours, more preferably at least 4 hours, even more preferably at least 8 hours, even more preferably still at least 12 or 24 or 48 or 72 hours before the CDK inhibitor, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In one particularly preferred embodiment, the ErbB inhibitor is administered at least 24 hours before the CDK inhibitor, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In another preferred embodiment, the ErbB inhibitor and the CDK inhibitor, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are each administered in a therapeutically effective amount with respect to the individual components. In an alternative preferred embodiment, the ErbB inhibitor and the CDK inhibitor, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, are each administered in a sub-therapeutically effective amount with respect to the individual components. The term âsub-therapeutically effective amountâ means an amount that is lower than that typically required to produce a therapeutic effect with respect to treatment with the ErbB inhibitor or the CDK inhibitor, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, alone. In a highly preferred embodiment, the ErbB inhibitor is administered sequentially or separately prior to the CDK inhibitor, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In another highly preferred embodiment, the CDK inhibitor, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is administered sequentially or separately prior to the ErbB inhibitor. Proliferative Disorder The term âproliferative disorderâ is used herein in a broad sense to include any disorder that requires control of the cell cycle, for example cardiovascular disorders such as restenosis and cardiomyopathy, auto-immune disorders such as glomerulonephritis, lupus nephritis, mesangial proliferative disorders and rheumatoid arthritis, cystic diseases such as polycystic kidney disease, polycystic liver disease, medullary cystic disease, dermatological disorders such as psoriasis, anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, antiparasitic disorders such as malaria, emphysema and alopecia. In these disorders, the compounds of the present invention may induce apoptosis or maintain stasis within the desired cells as required. In respect of all of the above aspects and embodiments, preferably the proliferative disorder is cancer. In one highly preferred embodiment, the proliferative disorder is ovarian cancer. In yet another highly preferred embodiment, the proliferative disorder is head or neck cancer. In yet another highly preferred embodiment, the proliferative disorder is breast cancer. In yet another highly preferred embodiment, the proliferative disorder is lung cancer, more preferably, NSCLC. In one preferred embodiment, the present invention relates to a method of treating non-small cell lung cancer, said method comprising simultaneously, sequentially or separately administering to a subject an ErbB inhibitor and a CDK inhibitor, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, selected from: (a) roscovitine; (b) 3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-2-methyl-pentan-2-ol; (c) 3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-pentan-2-ol; and (d) (2R,3S-3-(6-((4,6-dimethylpyridin-3-ylmethylamino)-9-isopropyl-9H-purin-2-ylamino)pentan-2-ol. Lung cancers (bronchogenic carcinomas) may be divided into two broad categories namely, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The distinction between these two types of cancer is based on the appearance of the tumour cells when viewed under a microscope. SCLC accounts for 20% of lung cancers diagnosed and is characterised by small cells which are mostly filled with the nucleus (hence the name). It is sometimes also referred to as âoat cellâ cancer. SCLC is the most aggressive type of cancer, which metastasizes rapidly to other parts of the body. Diagnosis with SCLC often occurs only after the cancer has spread throughout the body. In general, SCLC is almost always caused as a result of smoking. NSCLC can be subdivided into a group of related lung cancers which include epidermoid or squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma. Squamous cell lung cancer accounts for approximately 30% of all lung cancer cases and develops from reserve cells (which have the role of replacing damaged epithelium cells) in the lining of the lungs and bronchi. As a result, the cancer often initially develops in the centre of the chest. Squamous cell lung cancers are frequently slow growing and can take several years to progress from a confined tumour into invasive cancer. In 10-20% of cases, the cancer cavitates within the lungs. On metastasis, it often spreads to the bone, liver, adrenal glands, small intestine and brain. Adenocarcinoma is the most common form of lung cancer making up 30-40% of all lung cancer cases. Adenocarcinoma develops in the outer part of the lung and develops from mucus-producing cells. The course of this cancer varies widely but often progresses slowly and the patient will present with few or no symptoms. In some cases, however, it can be extremely aggressive and rapidly fatal. In 50% of cases when it metastasises, it spreads only to the brain. Other locations to which adenocarcinoma spreads include the liver, the adrenal glands and bone. The incidence of large cell carcinoma occurs less frequently than that of either adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma and accounts for 10-20% of lung cancer cases. The cancer is composed of large-sized cells that are anaplastic in nature and often arise in the bronchi. Large cell carcinoma develops on the periphery of the lungs and can spread to the plura. Currently, lung cancer may be treated by surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Chemotherapy may be administered either alone or in combination with the other treatment options. Common NSCLC drugs and regimens include CamptosarÂ® (irinotecan; CPT-11), camptothecin, ParaplatinÂ® (carboplatin), PlatinolÂ® (cisplatin), epirubicin, GemzarÂ® (gemcitabine), NavelbineÂ® (vinorelbine), oxaliplatin, TaxolÂ® (paclitaxel) and TaxotereÂ® (docetaxol) (NSCLC TreatmentâChemotherapy, Lung Cancer Online). However, chemotherapy is not curative. Other disadvantages of this treatment include toxicity, bystander damage to normal tissues and drug resistance (W. Wang et al, Cancer Sci., 2005, 96(10), 706). Furthermore, studies have shown that there is little survival benefit with some of the known treatments, such as vinorelbine (M. A. Socinski et al, Clin. Adv. Hematol. Oncol., 2003, 1(1), 33). Even a novel active such as troxacitabine has been shown to have little activity in NSCLC in 10 mg/m2 doses administered intravenously over 30 minutes every three weeks (S. F. Dent et al, Lung, 2005, 183(4), 265). The combination of gemcitabine/cisplatin has become widely used in Europe for the treatment of NSCLC. Cisplatin, however, is acknowledged to have certain disadvantages in that significant non-hematological toxicity (ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity) occurs in patients, along with emesis (P. Zatloukal et al, Lung Cancer, 2002, 38, S33).

Pharmaceutical Compositions In a particularly preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical product of the invention is in the form of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient. Even though the compounds of the present invention (including their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters and pharmaceutically acceptable solvates) can be administered alone, they will generally be administered in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent, particularly for human therapy. The pharmaceutical compositions may be for human or animal usage in human and veterinary medicine. Examples of such suitable excipients for the various different forms of pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be found in the âHandbook of Pharmaceutical Excipientsâ, 2nd Edition, (1994), Edited by A Wade and P J Weller. Acceptable carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Co. (A. R. Gennaro edit. 1985). Examples of suitable carriers include lactose, starch, glucose, methyl cellulose, magnesium stearate, mannitol, sorbitol and the like. Examples of suitable diluents include ethanol, glycerol and water. The choice of pharmaceutical carrier, excipient or diluent can be selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise as, or in addition to, the carrier, excipient or diluent any suitable binder(s), lubricant(s), suspending agent(s), coating agent(s), solubilising agent(s). Examples of suitable binders include starch, gelatin, natural sugars such as glucose, anhydrous lactose, free-flow lactose, beta-lactose, corn sweeteners, natural and synthetic gums, such as acacia, tragacanth or sodium alginate, carboxymethyl cellulose and polyethylene glycol. Examples of suitable lubricants include sodium oleate, sodium stearate, magnesium stearate, sodium benzoate, sodium acetate, sodium chloride and the like. Preservatives, stabilizers, dyes and even flavoring agents may be provided in the pharmaceutical composition. Examples of preservatives include sodium benzoate, sorbic acid and esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid. Antioxidants and suspending agents may be also used. Prodrugs The invention further includes agents of the present invention in prodrug form. Such prodrugs are generally compounds wherein one or more appropriate groups have been modified such that the modification may be reversed upon administration to a human or mammalian subject. Such reversion is usually performed by an enzyme naturally present in such subject, though it is possible for a second agent to be administered together with such a prodrug in order to perform the reversion in vivo. Examples of such modifications include esters (for example, any of those described above), wherein the reversion may be carried out be an esterase etc. Other such systems will be well known to those skilled in the art. Salts/Esters The agents of the present invention can be present as salts or esters, in particular pharmaceutically acceptable salts or esters. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the agents of the invention include suitable acid addition or base salts thereof. A review of suitable pharmaceutical salts may be found in Berge et al, J Pharm Sci, 66, 1-19 (1977). Salts are formed, for example with strong inorganic acids such as mineral acids, e.g. sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid or hydrohalic acids; with strong organic carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 4 carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted (e.g., by halogen), such as acetic acid; with saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or tetraphthalic; with hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid; with aminoacids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid; with benzoic acid; or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C1-C4)-alkyl- or aryl-sulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such as methane- or p-toluene sulfonic acid. Esters are formed either using organic acids or alcohols/hydroxides, depending on the functional group being esterified. Organic acids include carboxylic acids, such as alkanecarboxylic acids of 1 to 12 carbon atoms which are unsubstituted or substituted (e.g., by halogen), such as acetic acid; with saturated or unsaturated dicarboxylic acid, for example oxalic, malonic, succinic, maleic, fumaric, phthalic or tetraphthalic; with hydroxycarboxylic acids, for example ascorbic, glycolic, lactic, malic, tartaric or citric acid; with aminoacids, for example aspartic or glutamic acid; with benzoic acid; or with organic sulfonic acids, such as (C1-C4)-alkyl- or aryl-sulfonic acids which are unsubstituted or substituted (for example, by a halogen) such as methane- or p-toluene sulfonic acid. Suitable hydroxides include inorganic hydroxides, such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide. Alcohols include alkanealcohols of 1-12 carbon atoms which may be unsubstituted or substituted, e.g. by a halogen). Enantiomers/Tautomers The invention also includes where appropriate all enantiomers and tautomers of the agents. The man skilled in the art will recognise compounds that possess optical properties (one or more chiral carbon atoms) or tautomeric characteristics. The corresponding enantiomers and/or tautomers may be isolated/prepared by methods known in the art. Stereo and Geometric Isomers Some of the agents of the invention may exist as stereoisomers and/or geometric isomersâe.g. they may possess one or more asymmetric and/or geometric centres and so may exist in two or more stereoisomeric and/or geometric forms. The present invention contemplates the use of all the individual stereoisomers and geometric isomers of those inhibitor agents, and mixtures thereof. The terms used in the claims encompass these forms, provided said forms retain the appropriate functional activity (though not necessarily to the same degree). The present invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of the agent or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. An isotopic variation of an agent of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is defined as one in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine and chlorine such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 17O, 18O, 31P, 32P, 35S, 18F and 36Cl, respectively. Certain isotopic variations of the agent and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for example, those in which a radioactive isotope such as 3H or 14C is incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopic variations of the agent of the present invention and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof of this invention can generally be prepared by conventional procedures using appropriate isotopic variations of suitable reagents. Solvates The present invention also includes solvate forms of the agents of the present invention. The terms used in the claims encompass these forms. Polymorphs The invention furthermore relates to agents of the present invention in their various crystalline forms, polymorphic forms and (an)hydrous forms. It is well established within the pharmaceutical industry that chemical compounds may be isolated in any of such forms by slightly varying the method of purification and or isolation from the solvents used in the synthetic preparation of such compounds. Administration The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be adapted for oral, rectal, vaginal, parenteral, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intraarterial, intrathecal, intrabronchial, subcutaneous, intradermal, intravenous, nasal, buccal or sublingual routes of administration. For oral administration, particular use is made of compressed tablets, pills, tablets, gellules, drops, and capsules. Preferably, these compositions contain from 1 to 2000 mg and more preferably from 50-1000 mg, of active ingredient per dose. Other forms of administration comprise solutions or emulsions which may be injected intravenously, intraarterially, intrathecally, subcutaneously, intradermally, intraperitoneally or intramuscularly, and which are prepared from sterile or sterilisable solutions. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may also be in form of suppositories, pessaries, suspensions, emulsions, lotions, ointments, creams, gels, sprays, solutions or dusting powders. An alternative means of transdermal administration is by use of a skin patch. For example, the active ingredient can be incorporated into a cream consisting of an aqueous emulsion of polyethylene glycols or liquid paraffin. The active ingredient can also be incorporated, at a concentration of between 1 and 10% by weight, into an ointment consisting of a white wax or white soft paraffin base together with such stabilisers and preservatives as may be required. Injectable forms may contain between 10-1000 mg, preferably between 10-500 mg, of active ingredient per dose. Compositions may be formulated in unit dosage form, i.e., in the form of discrete portions containing a unit dose, or a multiple or sub-unit of a unit dose. In one preferred embodiment, the CDK inhibitor, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is administered orally or intravenously. In one preferred embodiment, AG1478 is administered intravenously. In one preferred embodiment, trastuzumab is administered intravenously. In one preferred embodiment, cetuximab is administered intravenously. In one preferred embodiment, erlotinib is administered orally. In one preferred embodiment, gefitinib is administered orally. In one preferred embodiment, lapatinib is administered orally. Dosage A person of ordinary skill in the art can easily determine an appropriate dose of one of the instant compositions to administer to a subject without undue experimentation. Typically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual patient and it will depend on a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the individual undergoing therapy. The dosages disclosed herein are exemplary of the average case. There can of course be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention. Depending upon the need, the agent may be administered at a dose of from 0.1 to 30 mg/kg body weight, such as from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, more preferably from 2 to 20 mg/kg body weight. The CDK inhibitor, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, is typically administered from about 0.05 to about 5 g/day, preferably from about 0.4 to about 3 g/day. Roscovitine is preferably administered orally in tablets or capsules. The total daily dose of roscovitine can be administered as a single dose or divided into separate dosages administered two, three or four times a day. Preferably, roscovitine is administered orally or intravenously at a dosage of from 0.4 to 3 g/day. By way of guidance, the ErbB inhibitor is typically administered in accordance with a physician's direction at dosages described in the relevant references or between the approved dosages for said ErbB inhibitor. Said approved dosages are available from the Summary of Product Characteristics for each agent which may be obtained from the manufacturer or from the literature e.g. www.emea.eu.int/htms/human/epar/a-zepar.htm.

The present invention is further described by way of example, and with reference to the following figures, wherein: FIG. 1 shows that seliciclib and trastuzumab synergistically downregulate HER2 levels in SkBr3 cells. In more detail, SkBr3 cells were seeded at approximately 8Ã105 cells/plate in 10 cm dishes and left to settle overnight. Cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of trastuzumab (A), seliciclib (B) or seliciclib+trastuzumab (C) for 24 h prior to harvesting. Protein lysates (30 Î¼g) from each treatment were resolved on 3-8% acrylamide Tris-acetate gels or 10% acrylamide Bis-Tris gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the antibodies shown. Results are representative of two independent experiments. FIG. 2 shows the analysis of EGFR signalling pathway proteins in A549, H460 and H358 cell lysates. In more detail, lysates (30 Î¼g) from untreated A549, H460 and H358 cells were resolved on 3-8% acrylamide Tris-acetate gels or 10% acrylamide Bis-Tris gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the antibodies shown. Results are representative of two independent experiments. FIG. 3 shows seliciclib and AG1478 synergistically downregulate EGFR signalling in H358 cells. In more detail, H358 cells were seeded at approximately 8Ã105 cells/plate in 10 cm dishes and left to settle overnight. Cells were incubated in the presence (+) or absence (â) of seliciclib and AG1478, for 72 h prior to harvesting. In H358 cells the IC50 for seliciclib was 8.5 Î¼M and for AG1478 it was 4.0 Î¼M.

Cell cultures were maintained in DMEM, except for H1650 and H358 cells, which were grown in RPMI medium. Cells were cultured at 37Â° C. in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in media containing 10% (v/v) foetal calf serum (FCS), 100 Units/ml penicillin and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. All reagents were purchased from Sigma (Poole, UK) unless stated otherwise. Drug Combination Analysis Experiments were performed in 96-well plates. SkBr3 and MCF7 cells were seeded at a density of 5,000 cells/well, in media containing 1% (v/v) FCS. H358, H1650 and H460 cells were seeded at 3,000 cells/well, and A549 cells at 2,000 cells/well, in media containing 10% (v/v) FCS. Stock solutions of seliciclib (Cyclacel Ltd., Dundee, UK) and AG1478 (Tocris Bioscience, Bristol, UK) were prepared in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), while trastuzumab (Genentech Inc, South San Francisco, USA) was dissolved in 0.9% (w/v) sterile saline solution. Serial dilutions (1.5-fold) for each compound were prepared, with the concentration range spanning the IC50 value of each drug. For experimental assessment of potential synergistic interactions, the concomitant treatment regime involved simultaneous treatment of cells with seliciclib and either trastuzumab or AG1478 for 72 h, alongside suitable controls of cells treated with the individual compounds alone for 72 h. In the sequential treatment regimes, one drug was added to the cells 2 h after plating, and left for 24 h. Media was then aspirated, replaced with fresh media containing the second drug and incubated for a further 72 h. The two individual treatment controls for the sequential treatment regime involved substituting one of the drug treatments with drug-free media. All treatments were performed in triplicate wells. After drug treatment, the number of viable cells in each well was estimated by incubating for 1 h in media containing 10% alamar blue (Roche, Lewes, East Sussex, U.K.) and measuring the absorbance at 488-595 nm. Drug interactions were analysed using the Calcusyn software package (BioSoft, Cambridge, U.K.), which is based on the median effect model of Chou and Talalay [19]. A Combination Index (C.I.) of 1 indicated an additive drug interaction, whereas a C.I. greater than 1 was antagonistic and a score lower than 1 was synergistic. Western Blot Analysis Cells were seeded at approximately 8Ã105 cells/plate on 10 cm plates and left to settle overnight. Compounds were added to the plates and cells were incubated for the indicated times. Media was removed from each of the wells and centrifuged at 1,000Ãg for 5 min to pellet any cells that had become detached from the plate surface. Cells that remained attached to the plate were washed once with ice-cold buffer A (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, containing 20 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, and protease inhibitor cocktail (Merck, Nottingham, U.K.)), then scraped into 0.350 ml buffer B (buffer A containing 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mM sodium fluoride and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate). The resuspended cells were then pooled with the appropriate media cell pellet and lysed by sonication (2Ã3s bursts using Sanyo soniprep 150 at 5 amp). The protein concentration of each lysate was determined using the BCA assay (Perbio Science, Northumberland, U.K.). Lysates (20-30 Î¼g protein/well) were resolved on 3-8% acrylamide Tris-acetate gels or 10% acrylamide Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen, Glasgow, U.K.) and the proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, London, U.K.) using the Invitrogen wet transfer system. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in PBS containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST) and 5% (w/v) fat-free dried milk. Primary antibody incubations were carried out overnight at 2-8Â° C. in PBST containing 3% (w/v) dried milk, using the following primary antibodies: ErbB2 (Calbiochem, Nottingham, U.K.), EGFR (Calbiochem), phospho-Tyr1068 EGFR (New England Biolabs, Hertfordshire, U.K.), cyclin D1 (Lab Vision, Suffolk, U.K.), phospho-Thr185 ERK1 and phospho-Thr202 ERK2 (Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.), ERK2 (Abcam), Asp-214 cleaved PARP (BD Pharmingen, Oxford, UK.) and Î²-Actin. Membranes were washed three times in PBST, and then incubated for 1 h with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Perbio) at 1:5000 dilution in PBST containing 3% (w/v) milk. Membranes were washed three times in PBST prior to development using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Corporation, Buckinghamshire, U.K.). Flow Cytometry H358 or H1650 cells were seeded in 10 cm plates at approximately 5Ã105 cells/plate and left to settle overnight. Cells were treated with 1ÃIC50 seliciclib, AG1478 or both drugs together. After 72 h treatment, cells were harvested by trypsinisation, washed twice in PBS and then fixed overnight in 70% (v/v) ethanol at â20Â° C. Cells were washed twice in PBS containing 1% (w/v) BSA, then incubated with 50 Î¼g/ml propidium iodide and 50 Î¼g/ml ribonuclease A for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were analysed for DNA content by flow cytometry using the CellQuest programme on a Becton Dickinson LSR flow cytometer. In vivo Studies Female (nu/nu) mice were injected subcutaneously with Ë1Ã107H358 cells/mouse at a single site on their flanks. Tumours were allowed to grow to Ë110 mm3 before being pair-matched by tumour size into treatment groups (9 mice/group). One group was treated with seliciclib (50 mg/kg) as a twice daily intraperitoneal injection for five consecutive days followed by a two day break; the treatment was then repeated for a total of four cycles. Erlotinib (100 mg/kg) was given daily by oral gavage for 28 consecutive days. The group treated with the combination were dosed in the same manner as both single agent groups. Mice were weighed at least twice a week to assess toxicity of the treatments and the tumours were measured with calipers at least twice a week to determine tumour growth. During the first week of treatment there was some weight loss in the animals. However, this appeared to be associated with the initial vehicle used for seliciclib (50 mM HCl) as the weight loss also occurred in the vehicle control group (max weight loss 11% between days 8-11). On Day 10 the vehicle was changed to 10% cremophor, 10% ethanol, 80% saline for the control and the two groups receiving seliciclib; all three groups started gaining weight immediately. Tumour measurements were converted into volumes using the formula: tumour volume (mm3)=width2 (mm)Ãlength (mm)Ã0.52. The percent tumour growth inhibition was determined with the formula: 1â(change in treated tumour volume/change in control tumour volume)Ã100. For each group statistical significance was determined by comparing to the control group using a one-way ANOVA followed by a Dunnett's test. Significance between different treatment groups was determined using a two sided unpaired Student's T-test. Results and Discussion Compounds that target CDKs or members of the ErbB family have attracted significant interest as cancer therapeutics. Inhibitors of either of these kinase families have shown some clinical activity as single agents, but are ultimately more likely to be used in combination with other drugs [20]. The aim of this series of experiments was to determine whether inhibitors of these two protein kinase families can be combined synergistically. To evaluate the interaction between seliciclib and trastuzumab, combination experiments were performed in breast cancer cell lines; either SkBr3, which overexpresses HER2, or MCF7, which expresses low levels of HER2 [15]. Incubation with trastuzumab (1-100 nM) reduced proliferation of SkBr3 cells by up to 40%, but had no significant effect on MCF7 cells (data not shown), in agreement with previous data [15]. Seliciclib inhibited the growth of both cell lines with an IC70 of 20.4 Î¼M and 15.4 Î¼M in SkBr3 and MCF7 cells respectively. Co-incubation of seliciclib and trastuzumab resulted in a moderately synergistic inhibition of cell growth in the SkBr3 cell line (Table 1) generating a Calcusyn combination index (CI) of 0.73 at ED50 (the point at which the combination inhibits cell growth by 50%). Mitogenic stimuli transduced by the HER2 signalling pathway result in the expression of cyclin D1 and the consequent activation of CDKs leading to cellular proliferation [3]. Thus overexpression or constitutive activation of these receptors results in oncogenic transformation. Indeed it has been shown that cyclin D is required for transformation by the HER2 receptor [21], and cyclin D1-deficient mice are resistant to HER2-mediated tumorigenesis [22, 23]. To evaluate the mechanism behind the synergistic seliciclib/trastuzumab combination, analysis of the effects on the HER2 signalling pathway was performed. SkBr3 cells were incubated with seliciclib, trastuzumab or the combination of both agents for 24 h, cell lysates were prepared and the levels of HER2 and cyclin D1 proteins examined by western blot. Trastuzumab treatment had a modest effect on HER2 levels, at concentrations up to 28 nM (FIG. 1A), which is consistent with previous findings that demonstrated that this drug does not dramatically downregulate HER2 levels in SkBr3 cells [24]. On the other hand, treatment with seliciclib alone decreased HER2 levels in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 1B). The downregulation of HER2 receptor levels by seliciclib was most likely due to its inhibitory effects on CDKs 7 and 9 [25, 26] resulting in decreased transcription of the receptor and loss of the HER2 protein as it is naturally turned over within the cell [27]. Trastuzumab and seliciclib when administered together produced greater downregulation of the HER2 receptor than either single agent treatment alone, suggesting that the drugs synergistically downregulate the levels of this receptor (FIG. 1C). As one of the final downstream components of the HER2 signalling pathway, it was of interest to examine the effect of the combination on cyclin D1 protein levels. At the concentrations tested in these experiments, trastuzumab treatment alone had no apparent effect on cyclin D1 levels (FIG. 1A), while seliciclib significantly decreased cyclin D1 levels in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 1B). This loss of cyclin D1 was slightly enhanced by combining seliciclib with trastuzumab (FIG. 1C). Cyclin D1 levels would most likely have been downregulated as a consequence of decreased HER2 signalling and also by seliciclib-mediated inhibition of cyclin D1 transcription [12]. These data indicate that in SkBr3 cells, seliciclib enhanced the efficacy of trastuzumab against the HER2 signalling pathway by promoting the downregulation of the HER2 receptor and loss of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1, which has been shown to be critical for propagating the HER2 mitogenic signal [21-23]. To extend the analysis of the synergistic interactions between seliciclib and inhibitors of ErbB family members, seliciclib was tested in combination with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor AG1478 [18, 28], an analogue of erlotinib. Erlotinib has been approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC having shown survival benefit in the treatment of lung cancer in clinical trials [29]. The combination between seliciclib and AG1478 was evaluated initially in three NSCLC cell lines: NCI-H358, A549 and NCI-H460. These cell lines express different levels of wild type EGFR with A549 cells expressing the highest levels of this receptor and H358 cells the least (FIG. 2). The IC50 values for AG1478 were 4 Î¼M, 6.6 Î¼M, and 10.4 Î¼M in H358, A549 and H460 cells respectively, demonstrating that there was no direct correlation between EGFR protein levels and sensitivity to AG1478. An equivalent pattern of sensitivity has been reported for erlotinib, leading to the description of these three cell lines as sensitive, intermediate and resistant respectively [30]. Combination analysis was performed evaluating concomitant incubations and sequential additions (both orientations). In H358 cells, concomitant drug treatment and pre-treatment with AG1478 followed by seliciclib caused synergistic inhibition of cell growth (ED50 CI values of 0.74 and 0.81 respectively (Table 2). To elucidate the molecular mechanism involved in the synergistic effects of seliciclib and AG1478, H358 cells were treated with either agent alone or in combination at concentrations equivalent to those used for the cytotoxicity analysis; cell lysates were prepared and proteins analysed by western blotting (FIG. 3). Initially the effects of the compounds on the levels of the EGFR and its phosphorylation status were studied. Treatment with either AG1478 or seliciclib decreased the level of the EGFR in a dose-dependent manner. When AG1478 and seliciclib were applied together, the EGFR protein levels were decreased more effectively than with either of the two individual drug treatments, suggesting that the drugs were promoting synergistic downregulation of the receptor (FIG. 3). Moreover, AG1478 treatment resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in EGFR phosphorylation, while seliciclib treatment had a limited effect. The reduction in the levels of EGFR phosphorylation was enhanced by the concomitant treatment, suggesting that the compounds were synergistically downregulating the quantity and activation status of the EGFR. To further explore the effects of the combination of seliciclib and AG1478 on the EGFR signalling pathway, two downstream components of the pathway were analysed; the phosphorylation status of ERK, and cyclin D1 protein levels. Seliciclib alone had no significant effect on ERK phosphorylation at the concentrations tested. AG1478, on the other hand, stimulated ERK phosphorylation at low concentrations, an effect that has also been observed with gefitinib in NSCLC cell lines [31], while having minimal effect at higher concentrations. However, the combination was very effective at reducing ERK phosphorylation, producing a clear decrease in the levels of phospho-ERK, suggesting an inhibition of EGFR signalling. Cyclin D1 lies downstream of the majority of ErbB receptor signalling pathways in its role as one of the key regulators of the cell cycle. Indeed a reduction in cyclin D1 levels has been shown to be essential to obtain a response to EGFR inhibitors both in vitro and in patients [32, 33]. Seliciclib concentrations at or above cellular IC50 values produced a modest decrease in cyclin D1 levels in H358 cells, while at the concentrations tested AG1478 had very little effect on the levels of this protein. However, when applied together, the two drugs dramatically reduced cyclin D1 expression in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 3). Once again seliciclib's contribution to the synergistic interaction was most likely due to the inhibition of CDKs 7 and 9, leading to a reduction in the levels of key components of the EGFR signalling pathway. Seliciclib treatment is known to cause apoptotic cell death [11, 34], but significant induction of apoptosis is not observed in many cell lines treated with AG1478, erlotinib or trastuzumab [17, 35-37]. Hence a synergistic induction of apoptosis was not anticipated when seliciclib and AG1478 were combined. Using PARP cleavage as a marker of apoptosis, western blot analysis demonstrated that at the AG1478 concentrations tested in H358 cells, there was no increase in PARP cleavage (FIG. 3). In contrast, seliciclib induced a dose-dependent increase in cleaved PARP but this was not enhanced in the presence of AG1478 (FIG. 3). Taken together, these results suggest that in H358 cells, the combination of seliciclib and AG1478 caused a synergistic inhibition of cell growth, primarily through the downregulation of the EGFR signalling pathway, resulting in a cessation of cell proliferation rather than an increased induction of apoptotic cell death. To explore the induction of apoptosis in more detail these studies were expanded to evaluate the combination in the NCI-H1650 NSCLC cell line. This cell line expresses a mutant EGFR and was reported to be very sensitive to erlotinib, with apoptosis being induced following erlotinib treatment [38]. Calcusyn analysis suggested that the seliciclib/AG1478 combination was slightly more synergistic in the H1650 cell line than in the H358 cells (data not shown). To evaluate the effect of the combination on apoptosis, H1650 and H358 cells were treated with the compounds at their appropriate cytotoxic IC50 concentration and the induction of apoptosis determined both by western blot analysis for the level of cleaved PARP and by flow cytometry analysis for the number of cells containing a sub-G1 DNA content. As previously demonstrated, (FIG. 3) at the IC50 concentration neither single agent nor the combination had a significant effect on the induction of cleaved PARP in H358 cells (FIG. 4A). The small amount of cleaved PARP in the DMSO control represented the natural apoptotic turnover within this cell line that was not increased by any of the treatments. In contrast, in H1650 cells both seliciclib and AG1478 caused a small increase in the levels of cleaved PARP when compared to the DMSO treated control. Moreover following treatment with the combination the increase in cleaved PARP was greater than either of the single agents alone (FIG. 4A). Flow cytometry analysis of cells from the same experiment showed the characteristic increase in G2/M phase cells following seliciclib treatment for both H358 and H1650 cells (FIG. 4B). In H358 cells none of the treatments led to a significant increase in cells containing a sub-G1 DNA content (apoptotic cells) above the Ë10% present in the DMSO treated control cells. In H1650 cells the control cells had a very low number of cells with a sub-G1 content (Ë2.5%); both single agent treatments led to small increases in the sub-G1 population and the combination led to a greater increase in the apoptotic population (FIG. 4B) in a manner analogous to the cleaved PARP data (FIG. 4A). Equivalent results were obtained in H1650 cells if the treatment concentrations were increased to 1.5 times or 2.25 times the cytotoxic IC50 value but importantly in each case a greater percentage of apoptotic cells was detected (data not shown). These data suggest that in cell lines that are susceptible to the induction of apoptosis following AG1478 treatment, the combination with seliciclib will result in greater levels of apoptotic induction. Finally the combination of seliciclib and erlotinib was evaluated in vivo in an H358 NSCLC xenograft model. Mice bearing H358 tumours of Ë110 mm3 were given seliciclib (50 mg/kg) intraperitoneally twice per day for five consecutive days and then after a two day treatment break this schedule was repeated for a total of 28 days. Erlotinib (100 mg/kg) was dosed by oral gavage once per day for 28 consecutive days, while for combination treatment mice received the same schedule as for each single agent. Control mice received seliciclib vehicle on a twice daily schedule. On day 49, three weeks after all treatments had ceased, control mice had tumours with a mean volume of 700 mm3 which represented a >6 fold increase in tumour size (FIG. 5). Mice treated with single agent seliciclib or erlotinib had mean tumour volumes of 717 mm3 and 444 mm3 respectively which indicated that neither agent had significant activity on their own at these doses. The low level of erlotinib activity (44% tumour growth inhibition p>0.05) correlated with the modest activity reported previously for this tumour type [30]. However, by day 49, mice treated with the combination of seliciclib and erlotinib had a mean tumour volume of 153 mm3 which represented 93% tumour growth inhibition. When all the groups were compared to the vehicle control using an ANOVA followed by Dunett's multiple comparison test, the only group that was statistically different was the combination group (p<0.01). If the individual groups were compared against each other using a Student's T test then the combination was also statistically significant from the single agent seliciclib and erlotinib treatments (p<0.002). The optimal T/C ratio (ratio of median treated tumour volume to median control tumour volume expressed as a percentage) was 22% by Day 49. Therefore in this H358 xenograft while neither erlotinib nor seliciclib was particularly efficacious when used as a single agent, the combination of the two compounds led to significant tumour growth delay. The data presented in this manuscript shows that CDK inhibitors such as seliciclib can interact synergistically with inhibitors of ErbB signalling pathways to prevent cell growth. This data represents the first report of synergy between CDK inhibitors and EGFR inhibitors. Importantly the combination of seliciclib and AG1478 was synergistic in cells that expressed either mutant EGFR or wild type EGFR. Significantly the combination between seliciclib and erlotinib showed dramatic synergy in vivo in a wild type EGFR expressing H358 xenograft model. At the molecular level, synergy appeared primarily to involve augmented downregulation of ErbB receptor levels and inhibition of downstream signalling, resulting in an enhanced loss of Cyclin D1, one of the key downstream components of ErbB signalling pathways. As combination of seliciclib with inhibitors of the ErbB receptor family appeared to act synergistically at a mechanistic level, so the combination of these agents could potentially improve the clinical efficacy of ErbB inhibitors, and also expand the number of tumours sensitive to these agents. These data suggest that these combinations are worthy of further investigation. Examining the in vitro and in vivo Synergy Between Seliciclib or Second Generation cdk Inhibitors and Other EGFR or Her2 Inhibitors in H292 and SkBr3 Cells H292 cells were treated with various concentrations of (i) seliciclib or the second generation inhibitors [1]-[4], (ii) ErbB inhibitors AG1478 erlotinib, gefitinib or lapatinib, or (iii) combinations thereof, for 72 hours. Cells were incubated with Alamar blue reagent and the absorbance readings were analysed by Calcusyn to obtain 50%, effective dose values. Experiments were repeated at least 3 times in triplicate. The results are shown in Table 3 below. Experiments were also performed with seliciclib or compound [4] in combination with lapatinib in the Her2 over expressing breast cancer cell line SkBr3 to evaluate the synergistic effect of targeting the Her2 signalling pathway (Table 4). For all of the second generation compounds, significant synergy was observed at ED50, in line with what was observed with seliciclib. These promising results were followed up in vivo, using an H292 xenograft model. Tumour cells were injected into nude mice and allowed to grow to approximately 130 mm3. At this time treatment was initiated. Groups of mice were administered vehicle, seliciclib, erlotinib or both compounds for approximately 2 weeks. Mice were monitored for signs of toxicity and the tumours were measured every 2-3 days and plotted in the graph below. Seliciclib or (3R)-3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-2-methyl-pentan-2-ol [1] were administered on days 1-5 and 11-15 at 50 mg and 40 mg bid respectively, and erlotinib was given on days 1-7 and 11-15. Dosing with erlotinib was initiated at 100 mg qd po for the first 7 days but was reduced to 50 mg qd po from day 11. Seliciclib and (3R)-3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-2-methyl-pentan-2-ol [1] had minimal if any effect on tumour growth as single agents at these doses (FIG. 6). Erlotinib was moderately effective as a single agent at this dose. The combination of erlotinib with seliciclib was slightly better than erlotinib alone, but the most dramatic effect was obtained by combining (3R)-3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-2-methyl-pentan-2-ol [1] and erlotinib. On day 8 both combinations were found to be significantly different from the erlotinib single agent treatment (pË0.02). However, thereafter only the (3R)-3-{9-isopropyl-6-[(pyridin-3-ylmethyl)-amino]-9H-purin-2-ylamino}-2-methyl-pentan-2-ol [1] and erlotinib combination remained statistically significant, reaching p=0.007 on day 15. Taken together, this data demonstrates that combinations of CDK inhibitors such as seliciclib or second generation inhibitors such as compounds [1]-[4] with EGFR inhibitors are synergistic in vitro and in vivo.
