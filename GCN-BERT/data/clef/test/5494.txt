In this case, for example, such monomers are used in which K1 and K2 each independently represent -B(OR17)2 where R11 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group; K3 and K4 each independently represent a halogen atom, an alkylsulfonyloxy group, or arylsul fonyloxy group; K5 represents -B(OR17)2 where R17 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group; and K6 represents a halogen atom, an alkylsulfonyloxy group, or arylsulfonyloxy group. A reaction among these monomers are effected in the presence of a Pd(O) catalyst to produce the polymers. In the above case, in a reaction in which at least one type of the two or more types of monomers including two leaving groups to be used in the reaction is a monomer including two -B(OR17)2 where R17 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group; and at least one type of the two or more types of monomers is a monomer including two halogen atoms, alkylsulfonyloxy groups, or arylsulfonyloxy groups, reaction procedures are generally conducted by effecting reaction among monomers represented by the formulas (10) and (11) for about 1 to 100 hours, adding the monomer (12) to the system and effecting reaction for about 0.5 to 50 hours, then adding the monomer (13) to the system and effecting reaction for about 0.5 to 50 hours. As the Pd(0) catalyst, for example, palladium[tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)], palladium acetates, or the like is used. One or more equivalents, preferably 1 to 10 equivalents, of an inorganic base such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, or barium hydroxide; an organic base such as triethylamine; and an inorganic salt such as cesium fluoride are added to the monomers to effect reaction. The reaction may be effected by using an aqueous solution of the inorganic salt in two-phase system. Examples of a solvent may include N,N-dimethylformamide, toluene, dimethoxy-ethane, or tetrahydrofuran. Depending on the solvent, reaction temperature is preferably about 50 to 160°C. The system may be heated to about the boiling point of the solvent, and then refluxed. Reaction time is about 1 to 200 hours. A case of employing the Yamamoto polymerization method is described. In this case, for example, such monomers are used in which K1, K2, K3, K4, K5 and K6 each independently represent a halogen atom, an alkylsulfonyloxy group, or arylsulfonyloxy group. A reaction among these monomers are effected in the presence of a Ni(0) complex to produce the polymers. In general, the reaction is effected by mixing all the monomers (10) to (13). As a method of using the Ni(0) complex (zerovalent nickel complex), there is a method of using zerovalent nickel itself and a method of effecting reaction of a nickel salt in the presence of a reducing agent to produce zerovalent nickel and using the zerovalent nickel in a reaction. Examples of the zerovalent nickel complex may include bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel(0), (ethylene)bis(triphenylphosphine)nickel(0), and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)nickel. Among these, bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) is preferable in view of being suitable for a wide variety of uses and inexpensive. Addition of a neutral ligand is preferable in view of increasing yield. The neutral ligand refers to a ligand without having an anion or a cation. Examples of the neutral ligand may include a nitrogen-containing ligand such as 2,2'-bipyridyl, 1,10-phenanthroline, methylenebisoxazoline, or N,N'-tetramethylethylenediamine; and a tertiary phosphine ligand such as triphenylphosphine, tritolylphosphine, tributylphosphine, or triphenoxyphosphine. The nitrogen-containing ligand is preferable in view of being suitable for a wide variety of uses and inexpensive, and 2,2'-bipyridyl is particularly preferable in view of high reactivity and high yield. In particular, a system containing bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) to which 2,2'-bipyridyl is added as a neutral ligand is preferable in view of increasing the yield of the polymers. In the method of using a zerovalent nickel in a reaction in a system, examples of the nickel salt may include nickel chloride or nickel acetate. Examples of the reducing agent may include zinc, sodium hydroxide, hydrazine and its derivatives, and lithium aluminum hydride. An additive such as ammonium iodide, lithium iodide, or potassium iodide may be used as necessary. A polymerization solvent is not particularly restricted as long as the solvent does not inhibit polymerization, but the solvent preferably contains one or more types of aromatic hydrocarbon solvents and/or ether solvents. Herein, examples of the aromatic hydrocarbon solvents may include benzene, toluene, xylene, trimethylbenzene, tetramethylbenzene, butylbenzene, naphthalin, and tetralin; and toluene, xylene, tetralin, and tetramethylbenzene are preferable. Examples of the ether solvent may include diisopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, diphenyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, and tert-butylmethylether; and tetrahydrofuran and 1,4-dioxane, which are good solvents for polymers, are preferable. Among the solvents, tetrahydrofuran is the most preferable. In view of improving polymerizability and solubility, a mixed solvent of the aromatic hydrocarbon solvents and/or ether solvents and a solvent other than aromatic hydrocarbon solvents and ether solvents may be used as long as the mixed solvent does not inhibit polymerization reaction. Reaction procedures and so on can be conducted, for example, according to a method shown in JP-A-2000-44544. In the Yamamoto polymerization method, for example, a polymerization reaction is generally conducted under an inert gas atmosphere such as argon or nitrogen in a solvent of tetrahydrofuran at a temperature of 60°C in the presence of a zerovalent nickel complex and a neutral ligand. Polymerization time is generally about 0.5 to 100 hours, but 10 hours or less is preferable in view of production cost. Polymerization temperature is generally about 0 to 200°C, but 20 to 100°C is preferable in view of high yield and low cost for heating. In the case of using a neutral ligand, the amounts of the neutral ligand to be used is preferably about 0.5 to 10 moles per 1 mole of a zerovalent nickel complex in view of reaction yield and cost, more preferably about 0.8 to 1.5 moles, and more preferably 0.9 to 1.1 moles. The amounts of the zerovalent nickel complex to be used are not particularly restricted as long as the complex does not inhibit polymerization reaction. However, when the amounts of the complex are too small, the resulting polymer tends to have low molecular weight. When the amounts of the complex are too large, post handling tends to be burdensome. The amounts of the complex is preferably 0.1 to 10 moles to 1 mole of a monomer, more preferably 1 to 5 moles, and still more preferably 2 to 3.5 moles. When a polymer is used as a light-emitting material for polymer LEDs, monomers before being polymerized are preferably purified by methods such as distillation, sublimation purification, or recrystallization, and then the monomers are polymerized. After the polymer is synthesized, a purification treatment such as fractionation like reprecipitation purification or chromatography may be conducted. The polymer contained in a composition according to the present invention may be one type, or two or more types. When the composition contains two or more types of polymers, the composition may contain a polymer that does not transport charges or a polymer that does not emit light. As for storage stability of a composition according to the present invention, it is preferred that viscosity change after a lapse of 30 days since preparation of the composition is within ±5% of the viscosity on preparation, and more preferably viscosity change after a lapse of 90 days since preparation of the composition is within ±5% of the viscosity on preparation. Examples of the method of forming a thin film with a composition according to the present invention include film forming methods such as spin-coating method, casting method, microgravure coating method, gravure-coating method, bar-coating method, roll-coating method, wire-bar coating method, dip-coating method, spray-coating method, screen printing method, flexographic printing method, offset printing method, and inkjet method. Among the methods, the composition according to the present invention is particularly suitable for forming films with the inkjet method. The inkjet method is conducted by dissolving a polymer in a solvent and dispensing the polymer with inkjet equipment or the like. The solution may contain an additive or a dopant on preparation of the solution. The inkjet method is advantageous in that different colors can be applied separately and materials can be utilized efficiently with small loss of the materials. The optimal value of thin film thickness differs depending upon a material to be used and uses. The film thickness is, for example, 1 nm to 1 µm, preferably 2 nm to 500 nm, and further preferably, 5 nm to 200 nm. A composition according to the present invention is characterized in that a thin film with uniform thickness is formed with the composition. A thin film with uniform thickness causes less light-emission irregularity when the film is used as the light-emitting layer of a polymer LED, and a device with such a polymer LED has a longer luminance half life period. Herein, a uniform film preferably refers to a film having a planar profile particularly in the central portion of the film. A film with slightly convex or concave profile does not cause problems because light-emission irregularity is small. However, a thin film with a greatly concave profile causes considerable light-emission irregularity, and a device with such a film has a shorter luminance half life period. There are various methods for measuring profiles of thin films. For example, there is a method of charging a liquefied composition into a syringe, dispensing the composition on a glass substrate with the syringe to which a high precision needle is attached, drying the composition, and then measuring the profile of the dried thin film with an interference microscope. The thin film may be dried at room temperature or at an elevated temperature, under a normal pressure or a reduced pressure. The profile of a thin film can be evaluated visually by looking at the profile, but can also be evaluated based on the film thickness of the central portion of the film and the film thickness of the thickest portion of the film. That is, in view of reducing light-emission irregularity, a value obtained by dividing the film thickness of the thickest portion by the film thickness of the central portion of a film is preferably equal to or less than 1.50, more preferably equal to or less than 1.35, still more preferably equal to or less than 1.20, yet more preferably equal to or less than 1.10, and still yet more preferably equal to or less than 1.05. A polymer LED according to the present invention comprises a light-emitting layer between electrodes consisting of an anode and a cathode and characterized in that the light-emitting layer is formed with the composition according to the present invention. The polymer LED according to the present invention includes a polymer light-emitting device at least comprising a layer containing a conductive polymer adjacent to one of the electrodes between the electrode and the light-emitting layer; and a polymer light-emitting device at least comprising a insulation layer with an average film thickness of 2 nm or less adjacent to one of the electrodes between the electrode and the light-emitting layer. Furthermore, examples of a polymer LED according to the present invention include a polymer LED formed by providing an electron transport layer between an cathode and a light-emitting layer; a polymer LED formed by providing a hole transport layer between an anode and a light-emitting layer; and a polymer LED formed by providing an electron transport layer between an cathode and a light-emitting layer and a hole transport layer between the anode and the light-emitting layer. Specific examples of a structure of a polymer LED according to the present invention include the following structures a) to d). a)anode/light-emitting layer/cathode b) anode/hole transport layer/light-emitting layer/cathodec) anode/light-emitting layer/electron transport layer/cathoded) anode/hole transport layer/light-emitting layer/electron transport layer/cathode (where the mark "/" means that individual layers are stacked in adjacent to each other.) Herein, the light-emitting layer is a layer with a function to emit light; the hole transport layer is a layer with a function to transport holes; and an electron transport layer is a layer with a function to transport electrons. Note that the electron transport layer and the hole transport layer are collectively called as a charge transport layer. The light-emitting layer, the hole transport layer, and the electron transport layer may be independently used as two or more layers. Of the charge transport layers provided in adjacent to an electrode, one having a function of improving charge injection efficiency from the electrode and an effect of reducing the driving voltage of the device is generally called particularly as a charge injection layer (hole injection layer, electron injection layer) in some cases. To improve adhesion properties to an electrode and improve charge injection from the electrode, the charge injection layer or an insulating layer of 2 nm or less in thickness may be provided in adjacent to the electrode. Alternatively, to improve adhesion properties to the interface or to prevent contamination, a thin insulating layer may be inserted into the interface between a charge transport layer and a light-emitting layer. The order, number and thickness of layers to be stacked can be appropriately set in consideration of light emission efficiency and the lifespan of a device. In the present invention, as a polymer LED having a charge injection layer (electron injection layer, hole injection layer) provided therein, mention may be made of a polymer LED having a charge injection layer in adjacent to a cathode and a polymer LED having an charge injection layer in adjacent to an anode. For example, the following structures e) to p) may be specifically mentioned. e) anode/charge injection layer/light-emitting layer/cathodef) anode/light-emitting layer/charge injection layer/cathodeg) anode/charge injection layer/light-emitting layer/charge injection layer/cathodeh) anode/charge injection layer/hole transport layer/light-emitting layer/cathodei) anode/hole transport layer/light-emitting layer/charge injection layer/cathodej) anode/charge injection layer/hole transport layer/light-emitting layer/charge injection layer/cathodek) anode/charge injection layer/light-emitting layer/electron transport layer/cathodel) anode/light-emitting layer/electron transport layer/charge injection layer/cathodem) anode/charge injection layer/light-emitting layer/electron transport layer/charge injection layer/cathoden) anode/charge injection layer/hole transport layer/light-emitting layer/electron transport layer/cathodeo) anode/hole transport layer/light-emitting layer/electron transport layer/charge injection layer/cathodep) anode/charge injection layer/hole transport layer/light-emitting layer/electron transport layer/ charge injection layer/cathode. Specific examples of the charge injection layer include a layer containing an electric conductive polymer; a layer formed between an anode and a hole transport layer and containing ionization potential value between that of an anode material and a hole transportable material contained in the hole transport layer; and a layer provided between a cathode and an electron transport layer and having an electron affinity value between that of an anode material and an electron transportable material contained in the electron transport layer. When the charge injection layer is a layer containing an electric conductive polymer, the electric conductivity of the electric conductive polymer is preferably 10-5 S/cm to 103 (both inclusive), more preferably 10-5 S/cm to 102 (both inclusive), and further preferably 10-5 S/cm to 101 (both inclusive) to reduce a leakage current between light-emitting pixels. When the charge injection layer is a layer containing an electric conductive polymer, the electric conductivity of the electric conductive polymer is preferably 10-5 S/cm to 103 S/cm (both inclusive), more preferably 10-5 S/cm to 102 S/cm (both inclusive), and further preferably 10-5 S/cm to 101 S/cm (both inclusive) to reduce a leakage current between light-emitting pixels. To set an electric conductivity of the electric conductive polymer at 10-5 S/cm to 103 (both inclusive), generally an appropriate amount of ions are doped in the electric conductive polymer. The type of ions, if they are doped into a hole injection layer, are anion and if they are doped into an electron injection layer, are cations. Examples of the anions include polystyrene sulfonic acid ion, alkylbenzene sulfonic acid ion and camphor sulfonic acid ion. Examples of the cations include lithium ion, sodium ion, potassium ion and tetrabutylammonium ion. The film thickness of a charge injection layer is from 1 nm to 100 nm, and preferably, 2 nm to 50 nm. The material to be used in a charge injection layer may be appropriately selected in connection with the material to be used in a layer adjacent to an electrode. Examples thereof include polyaniline or a derivative thereof; polythiophene or a derivative thereof; polypyrrole or a derivative thereof; polyphenylenevinylene or a derivative thereof; polythienylenevinylene or a derivative thereof; polyquinoline or a derivative thereof; polyquinoxaline or a derivative thereof; an electric conductive polymer such as a polymer containing an aromatic amine structure in the main chain or a side chain; metal phthalocyanine (such as copper phthalocyanine); and carbon. The insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less has a function of facilitating charge injection. Examples of the material of the insulating layer include a metal fluoride, metal oxide and organic insulating material. Examples of a polymer LED having an insulating layer of a film thickness of 2 nm or less include a polymer LED having an insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less in adjacent to a cathode, and a polymer LED having an insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less in adjacent to an anode. For example, the following structures q) to ab) may be specifically mentioned. q) anode/insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less/light-emitting layer/cathode r) anode/light-emitting layer/insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less/cathode s) anode/insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less/light-emitting layer/insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less/cathode t) anode/insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less/hole transport layer/light-emitting layer/cathode u) anode/hole transport layer/light-emitting layer/insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less/cathode v) anode/insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less/hole transport layer/light-emitting layer/insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less/cathode w) anode/insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less/light-emitting layer/electron transport layer/cathode x) anode/light-emitting layer/electron transport layer/insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less/cathode y) anode/insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less/light-emitting layer/electron transport layer/ insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less /cathode z) anode/insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less/hole transport layer/light-emitting layer/electron transport layer/cathode aa) anode/hole transport layer/light-emitting layer/electron transport layer/insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less/cathode ab) anode/insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less/hole transport layer/light-emitting layer/electron transport layer/insulating layer having a film thickness of 2 nm or less/cathode The optimal value of film thickness of the light-emitting layer differs depending upon a material to be used. The film thickness may be selected such that driving voltage and light emission efficiency take appropriately values. The film thickness is, for example, 1 nm to 1 µm, preferably 2 nm to 500 nm, and further preferably, 5 nm to 200 nm. The light-emitting layer can also be formed with a composition according to the present invention. When a polymer LED according to the present invention has a hole transport layer, examples of the hole transportable material to be employed include polyvinylcarbazole or a derivative thereof; polysilane or a derivative thereof; polysiloxane derivative having an aromatic amine in a side chain or the main chain; pyrazoline derivative; arylamine derivative; stilbene derivative; triphenyl-diamine derivative; polyaniline or a derivative thereof; polythiophene or a derivative thereof; polypyrrole or a derivative thereof; poly(p-phenylenevinylene) or a derivative thereof; and poly(2,5-thienylenevinylene) or a derivative thereof. Specific examples of the hole transportable material include those described in JP-A-63-70257, JP-A-63-175860, JP-A-2-135359, JP-A-2-135361, JP-A-2-209988, JP-A-3-37992, and JP-A-3-152184. Of them, as a hole transportable material for use in hole transport layer, mention may be preferably made of polymer hole transportable materials such as polyvinylcarbazole or a derivative thereof, polysilane or a derivative thereof, a polysiloxane derivative having an aromatic amine compound group in a side chain or the main chain, polyaniline or a derivative thereof, polythiophene or a derivative thereof, poly(p-phenylenevinylene) or a derivative thereof, and poly(2,5-thienylenevinylene) or a derivative thereof; and more preferably, polyvinylcarbazole or a derivative thereof, polysilane or a derivative thereof, a polysiloxane derivative having an aromatic amine in a side chain or the main chain. The hole transportable material of a low molecular compound is preferably used by dispersing it in a polymer binder. Poly(N-vinylcarbazole) or a derivative thereof can be obtained from a vinyl monomer through cation polymerization or radical polymerization. Examples of polysilane or a derivative thereof include compounds described in Chem. Rev. Vol. No. 89, p. 1359 (1989) and the published specification of British Patent GB2300196. As a synthetic method thereof, the method described in these documents can be used. In particular, the Kipping method can be suitably used. In polysiloxane or a derivative thereof, since a polysiloxane skeleton structure has no hole transportability, one having the aforementioned structure of a low molecular weight hole transportable material in a side chain or the main chain is suitably used. In particular, one having a hole transportable aromatic amine in a side chain or the main chain may be mentioned. A method of forming a hole transfer layer film is not particularly limited. In the case of low molecular weight hole transportable material, a method of forming a film from a mixed solution with a polymer binder may be mentioned. In the case of a high molecular weight hole transportable material, a method of forming a film from a solution may be mentioned. A solvent for use in film-formation from a solution is not particularly restricted as long as the solvent dissolves a hole transportable material. Examples of the solvent may include the solvents used for the solution composition according to the present invention. Examples of the film formation method from a solution include a spin-coating method, casting method, microgravure coating method, gravure-coating method, bar-coating method, roll-coating method, wire-bar coating method, dip-coating method, spray-coating method, screen printing method, flexographic printing method, offset printing method and inkjet method. As the polymer binder to be mixed, it is preferred to use one which does not inhibit charge transfer extremely. Furthermore, it is suitable to use one having no intensive absorption to visible light. Example of the polymer binder include polycarbonate, polyacrylate, polymethylacrylate, polymethylmethacrylate, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride and polysiloxane. As the film thickness of a hole transport layer, its optimal value varies depending upon the material to be used. The film thickness may be selected such that driving voltage and light emission efficiency take appropriately values. However, it is at least required to have a sufficient film thickness not to produce pin holes. The extremely thick film is not preferable because the driving voltage of the device increases. Accordingly, the film thickness of the hole transport layer is, for example, from 1 nm to 1 µm, preferably 2 nm to 500 nm, and further preferably, 5 nm to 200 nm. The hole transport layer can also be formed with a composition according to the present invention. When a polymer LED according to the present invention has an electron transport layer, as the electron transportable material to be used, a known material may be used. Examples thereof include a metal complex of oxadiazole derivative thereof; anthraquinodimethane derivative thereof, benzoquinone or a derivative thereof, naphthoquinone or a derivative thereof, anthraquinone or a derivative thereof, tetracyanoanthraquino-dimethane or a derivative thereof, fluorenone derivative, diphenyl-dicyanoethylene or a derivative thereof; diphenoquinone derivative, or 8-hydroxyquinoline or a derivative thereof; polyquinoline or a derivative thereof; polyquinoxaline or a derivative thereof; and polyfluorene or a derivative thereof. Specific examples include those described in JP-A-63-70257, JP-A-63-175860, JP-A-2-135359, JP-A-2-135361, JP-A-2-209988, JP-A-3-37992 and JP-A-3-152184.

A film formation method for an electron transport layer is not particularly limited. Examples of a film formation method using a low molecular weight electron transportable material include a vacuum deposition method for forming a film from powder and a method for forming a film from a solution or molten state. Examples of a film formation method using a high molecular weight electron transportable material include a method of forming a film from a solution or molten state. In the method of forming a film from a solution or molten state, a polymer binder may be used together. A solvent for use in film-formation from a solution is not particularly restricted as long as the solvent dissolves an electron transportable material and/or a polymer binder. Examples of the solvent include chlorine base solvents such as chloroform, methylene chloride, and dichloroethane; ether base solvents such as tetrahydrofuran; aromatic hydrocarbon base solvents such as toluene and xylene; ketone base solvents such as acetone and methylethyl ketone; and ester solvents such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate and ethyl-cellosolve acetate.

As the polymer binder to be mixed, it is preferred to use one which does not inhibit charge transfer extremely. Furthermore, it is suitable to use one having no intensive absorption to visible light. Example of the polymer binder include poly(N-vinylcarbazole), polyaniline or a derivative thereof, polythiophene or a derivative thereof, poly(p-phenylenevinylene) or a derivative thereof, poly(2,5-thienylenevinylene) or a derivative thereof, polycarbonate, polyacrylate, polymethylacrylate, polymethylmethacrylate, polystyrene, polyvinylchloride and polysiloxane. As the film thickness of an electron transport layer, its optimal value varies depending upon the material to be used. The film thickness may be selected such that driving voltage and light emission efficiency take appropriately values. However, it is at least required to have a sufficient film thickness not to produce pin holes. The extremely thick film is not preferable because the driving voltage of the device increases. Accordingly, the film thickness of the electron transport layer is, for example, from 1 nm to 1 µm, preferably 2 nm to 500 nm, and further preferably, 5 nm to 200 nm. The electron transport layer can also be formed with a composition according to the present invention. As a substrate on which a polymer LED according to the present invention is formed, any substrate may be used as long as it cannot be influenced when an electrode is formed and then an organic material layer is formed. Examples of the substrate include substrates formed of glass, plastic, polymer film and silicon. When an opaque substrate is used, the opposite electrode is preferably transparent or semitransparent. Generally, at least one of the electrodes consisting of an anode and a cathode is transparent or semitransparent. The anode is preferably transparent or semitransparent. As the material for the anode, use may be made of, for example, a conductive metal oxide film and semitransparent metal thin film. Specific examples thereof include a film (NESA) formed of electrically conductive glass made of, for example, indium oxide, zinc oxide, tin oxide; and composites these such as indium tin oxide (ITO), indium/zinc/oxide, gold, platinum, silver and copper; and ITO, indium/zinc/oxide and tin oxide are preferable. Examples of the forming method include a vacuum deposition method, sputtering method, ion plating method and plating method. Furthermore, as the anode, use may be made of an organic electric conductive film such as polyaniline or a derivative thereof or polythiophene or a derivative thereof. The film thickness of an anode may be appropriately set in consideration of light permeability and electric conductivity, and is for example, 10 nm to 10 µm, preferably, 20 nm to 1 µm, and further preferably, 50 nm to 500 nm. To facilitate injection of charge, a layer having an average thickness of 2nm and formed of a phthalocyanine derivative, electric conductive polymer or carbon or formed of a metal oxide, metal fluoride or an organic insulating material, may be provided on the anode. As a material for the cathode to be used in a polymer LED according to the present invention, one having a small work function is preferable. Examples of the material to be used include metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, aluminum, scandium, vanadium, zinc, yttrium, indium, cerium, samarium, europium, terbium, and ytterbium; alloys formed of at least two of them; alloys formed of at least one of them and one selected from the group consisting of gold, silver, platinum, copper, manganese, titanium, cobalt, nickel, tungsten and tin; graphite; and a graphite intercalation compound. Examples of the alloy include Magnesium-silver alloy, magnesium-indium alloy, magnesium-aluminum alloy, indium-silver alloy, lithium-aluminum alloy, lithium-magnesium alloy, lithium-indium alloy and calcium-aluminum alloy. The cathode may have a stacked structure consisting of two or more layers. The film thickness of a cathode may be appropriately set in consideration of electric conductivity and durability, and is for example, 10 nm to 10 µm, preferably 20 nm to 1 µm and further preferable 50 nm to 500 nm. Examples of the method of forming a cathode include a vacuum deposition method, sputtering method, laminate method in which a metal thin film is formed by thermocompression bonding. Furthermore, a layer formed of an electric conductive polymer or a layer formed of e.g., a metal oxide, metal fluoride, or organic insulating material and having an average film thickness of 2 nm or less may be provided between the cathode and an organic layer. Alternatively, after the cathode is formed, a protecting layer for protecting the polymer LED may be applied. To use the polymer LED stably for a long time, the device may be externally protected preferably with a protecting layer and/or a protecting cover. As the protecting layer, use may be made of e.g., a polymer compound, metal oxide, metal fluoride and metal borate. Furthermore, as the protecting cover, use may be made of e.g., glass plate and plastic plate on the surface of which treatment of lowing water permeability is applied. A method of adhering the cover tight with the substrate of a device with a thermoplastic resin or a photosetting resin, thereby sealing them,is preferably used. It is easy to prevent the device from being damaged by keeping a space by use of a spacer. If an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon is introduced into the space, it is possible to prevent oxidation of the cathode. Furthermore, if a desiccating agent such as barium oxide is placed in the space, it is possible to suppress a moisture content adsorbed in the manufacturing step from damaging the device. At least one of the methods is preferably employed. A polymer light-emitting device according to the present invention may be used as a planar light source or a backlight of a segment type display device, a dot matrix display device, a liquid crystal display device, and the like. To obtain planar light emission by use of a polymer LED according to the present invention, a planar anode and a planar cathode are placed so as to overlap with each other. To obtain patterned light emission, there are a method in which a mask having a patterned window is provided on the surface of the planar light-emitting device; a method in which an organic material layer used in non light-emitting portion is formed extremely thick substantially not to emit light from the portion; and a method in which either one of or both of the anode and cathode are formed so as to have a pattern. A pattern is formed in accordance with any one of the methods, and several electrodes are arranged so as to independently turn ON/Off. In this way, it is possible to obtain a segment type display device capable of displaying numerical values, characters, and simple symbols. Furthermore, to obtain a dot-matrix device, both an anode and a cathode may be formed in stripe form and arranged so as to cross perpendicularly with each other. Sector color display and multicolor display can be attained by a method of separately applying a plurality of types of polymer phosphors different in emission color, or by a method of using a color filter or a fluorescent conversion filter.

EXAMPLES Now, the present invention will be more specifically explained with reference to Examples below, which will not be construed as limiting the invention. Herein, as to number average molecular weight and weight average molecular weight, gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (tradename: LC-10Avp manufactured by SHIMADZU CORPORATION) was used to determine Z average molecular weight, number average molecular weight, and weight average molecular weight relative to polystyrene. A polymer to be measured was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran so that its concentration became about 0.5 wt%, and 50µL of this solution was injected into the GPC. Tetrahydrofuran was used for mobile phase of the GPC and flowed at a rate of 0.6 mL/min. As for a column, two TSKgel SuperHM-H (tradename, manufactured by Tosoh Corporation) and one TSKgel SuperH2000 (tradename, manufactured by Tosoh Corporation) were combined serially. As for a detector, a differential refractometer detector (tradename: RID-10A manufactured by SHIMADZU CORPORATION) was used. The profile of a thin film was measured by charging 3 mL of a composition into a syringe, dispensing the composition on a glass substrate with the syringe to which a high precision needle FN-002N (tradename, 20µm pore size, manufactured by Musashi Engineering, Inc.) is attached, drying the composition under a reduced pressure in vacuo at an ordinary temperature for 10 minutes, and then measuring the profile of the dried thin film with an interference microscope Micromap557N (tradename, manufactured by Micromap Corporation). In measuring viscosity, LVDV-II+Pro (tradename) manufactured by BROOKFIELD Engineering Laboratories was used. (Synthesis Example 1) <Synthesis of Polymer 1> Under a nitrogen atmosphere, 195.37 g of the following compound A, 239.44 g of the following compound B, and 232.89 g of 2,2'-bipyridyl were dissolved in 46.26 kg of dehydrated tetrahydrofuran. After that, this solution was heated up to 60°C, 410.15 g of bis(1,5-cyclooctadiene)nickel(0) {Ni(COD)2} was added thereto, thereby effecting a reaction for 5 hours. After the reaction was complete, this reaction solution was cooled to room temperature, added dropwise to a mixed solution of 8.52 kg of 25% aqueous ammonia/ 16.88 kg of methanol/ 31.98 kg of ion exchanged water, and stirred for 2 hours. After that, precipitated substance was filtrated and dried under a reduced pressure. After the drying, the substance was dissolved in 16.22 kg of toluene. After the dissolution, 830 g of Radiolight was added thereto and insoluble matters were filtrated. Thus obtained filtrate was purified through an alumina column. Subsequently, the purified solution was added to a mixture of 13.52 kg of ion exchanged water/ 2.04 kg of 25% aqueous ammonia, stirred for 0.5 hours and the water layer was removed. Furthermore, 13.52 kg of ion exchanged water was added to the organic layer, stirred for 0.5 hours and the water layer was removed. A part of the resulting organic layer was concentrated under a reduced pressure and added to 34.18 kg of methanol and stirred for an hour.
