BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to novel compounds having angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist activity and neprilysin-inhibition activity. The invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, processes and intermediates for preparing such compounds and methods of using such compounds to treat diseases such as hypertension. 2. State of the Art The aim of antihypertensive therapy is to lower blood pressure and prevent hypertension-related complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and renal disease. For patients with uncomplicated hypertension (that is, no risk factors, target organ damage, or cardiovascular disease), it is hoped that reducing blood pressure will prevent development of cardiovascular and renal comorbidities, conditions that exist at the same time as the primary condition in the same patient. For those patients with existing risk factors or comorbidities, the therapeutic target is the slowing of comorbid disease progression and reduced mortality. Physicians generally prescribe pharmacological therapies for patients whose blood pressure cannot be adequately controlled by dietary and/or lifestyle modifications. Commonly used therapeutic classes act to promote diuresis, adrenergic inhibition, or vasodilation. A combination of drugs is often prescribed, depending upon what comorbidities are present. There are five common drug classes used to treat hypertension: diuretics, which include thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics such as hydrochlorothiazide, loop diuretics such as furosemide, and potassium-sparing diuretics such as triamterene; β1 adrenergic receptor blockers such as metoprolol succinate and carvedilol; calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine; angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as captopril, benazepril, enalapril, enalaprilat, lisinopril, quinapril, and ramipril; and AT1 receptor antagonists, also known as angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs), such as candesartan cilexetil, eprosartan, irbesartan, losartan, olmesartan medoxomil, telmisartan, and valsartan. Combinations of these drugs are also administered, for example, a calcium channel blocker (amlodipine) and an ACE inhibitor (benazepril), or a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide) and an ACE inhibitor (enalapril). All of these drugs, when used appropriately, are effective in the treatment of hypertension. Nevertheless, both efficacy and tolerability should be further improved in new drugs targeting hypertension. Despite the availability of many treatment options, the recent National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) demonstrated that only about 50% of all treated patients with hypertension achieve adequate blood pressure control. Furthermore, poor patient compliance due to tolerability issues with available treatments further reduces treatment success. In addition, each of the major classes of antihypertensive agents have some drawbacks. Diuretics can adversely affect lipid and glucose metabolism, and are associated with other side effects, including orthostatic hypotension, hypokalemia, and hyperuricemia. Beta blockers can cause fatigue, insomnia, and impotence; and some beta blockers can also cause reduced cardiac output and bradycardia, which may be undesirable in some patient groups. Calcium channel blockers are widely used but it is debatable as to how effectively these drugs reduce fatal and nonfatal cardiac events relative to other drug classes. ACE inhibitors can cause coughing, and rarer side effects include rash, angioedema, hyperkalemia, and functional renal failure. AT1 receptor antagonists are equally effective as ACE inhibitors but without the high prevalence of cough. Neprilysin (neutral endopeptidase, EC 3.4.24.11) (NEP), is an endothelial membrane bound Zn2+ metallopeptidase found in many tissues, including the brain, kidney, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, heart, and peripheral vasculature. NEP is responsible for the degradation and inactivation of a number of vasoactive peptides, such as circulating bradykinin and angiotensin peptides, as well as the natriuretic peptides, the latter of which have several effects including vasodilation and diuresis. Thus, NEP plays an important role in blood pressure homeostasis. NEP inhibitors have been studied as potential therapeutics, and include thiorphan, candoxatril, and candoxatrilat. In addition, compounds have also been designed that inhibit both NEP and ACE, and include omapatrilat, gempatrilat, and sampatrilat. Referred to as vasopeptidase inhibitors, this class of compounds are described in Robl et al. (1999) Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 9(12): 1665-1677. There may be an opportunity to increase anti-hypertensive efficacy when combining AT1 receptor antagonism and NEP inhibition, as evidenced by AT1 receptor antagonist/NEP inhibitor combinations described in WO 9213564 to Darrow et al (Schering Corporation); US20030144215 to Ksander et al.; Pu et al., Abstract presented at the Canadian Cardiovascular Congress (October 2004); and Gardiner et al. (2006) JPET 319:340-348; and WO 2007045663 (Novartis AG) to Glasspool et al. Recently, WO 2007056546 (Novartis AG) to Feng et al. has described complexes of an AT1 receptor antagonist and a NEP inhibitor, where an AT1 receptor antagonist compound is non-covalently bound to a NEP inhibitor compound, or where the antagonist compound is linked to the inhibitor compound by a cation. In spite of the advances in the art, there remains a need for a highly efficacious monotherapy with multiple mechanisms of action leading to levels of blood pressure control that can currently only be achieved with combination therapy. Thus, although various hypertensive agents are known, and administered in various combinations, it would be highly desirable to provide compounds having both AT1 receptor antagonist activity and NEP inhibition activity in the same molecule. Compounds possessing both of these activities are expected to be particularly useful as therapeutic agents since they would exhibit antihypertensive activity through two independent modes of action while having single molecule pharmacokinetics. In addition, such dual-acting compounds are also expected to have utility to treat a variety of other diseases that can be treated by antagonizing the AT1 receptor and/or inhibiting the NEP enzyme. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides novel compounds that have been found to possess AT1 receptor antagonist activity and neprilysin (NEP) enzyme inhibition activity.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention is directed to compounds of formula I: and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. As used herein, the term “compound of the invention” is intended to include compounds of formula I as well as the species embodied in formulas II-VI. In addition, the compounds of the invention may also contain several basic or acidic groups (for example, amino or carboxyl groups) and therefore, such compounds can exist as a free base, free acid, or in various salt forms. All such salt forms are included within the scope of the invention. Furthermore, solvates of compounds of formula I or salts thereof are included within the scope of the invention. Finally, the compounds of the invention may also exist as prodrugs. Accordingly, those skilled in the art will recognize that reference to a compound herein, for example, reference to a “compound of the invention” includes reference to a compound of formula I as well as to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs of that compound unless otherwise indicated. Further, the term “or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate and/or prodrug thereof” is intended to include all permutations of salts and solvates, such as a solvate of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt. The compounds of formula I may contain one or more chiral centers and so may exist in a number of stereoisomeric forms. When such chiral centers are present, the invention is directed to racemic mixtures, pure stereoisomers (enantiomers or diastereomers), stereoisomer-enriched mixtures, and the like unless otherwise indicated. When a chemical structure is depicted without any stereochemistry, it is understood that all possible stereoisomers are encompassed by such structure. Thus, for example, the term “compound of formula I” is intended to include all possible stereoisomers of the compound. Similarly, when a particular stereoisomer is shown or named herein, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that minor amounts of other stereoisomers may be present in the compositions of the invention unless otherwise indicated, provided that the utility of the composition as a whole is not eliminated by the presence of such other isomers. Individual enantiomers may be obtained by numerous methods that are well known in the art, including chiral chromatography using a suitable chiral stationary phase or support, or by chemically converting them into diastereomers, separating the diastereomers by conventional means such as chromatography or recrystallization, then regenerating the original enantiomers. Additionally, where applicable, all cis-trans or E/Z isomers (geometric isomers), tautomeric forms and topoisomeric forms of the compounds of the invention are included within the scope of the invention unless otherwise specified. Compounds of formula I may contain one or more chiral centers. One possible chiral center could be present in the “X” portion of the compound. For example, a chiral center exists at a carbon atom in the alkylene moiety in X that is substituted with an R4b group such as —C1-6alkyl, for example —CH3. This chiral center is present at the carbon atom indicated by the symbol * in the following partial formula: Another possible chiral center could be present at the carbon on the —X—CR5R6R7 group, when R6 is a group such as —C1-6alkyl, for example —CH2CH(CH3)2, and R7 is hydrogen. This chiral center is present at the carbon atom indicated by the symbol ** in the following formula: In one embodiment of the invention, the carbon atom identified by the symbol * and/or ** has the (R) configuration. In this embodiment, compounds of formula I have the (R) configuration at the carbon atom identified by the symbol * and/or ** or are enriched in a stereoisomeric form having the (R) configuration at this carbon atom (or atoms). In another embodiment, the carbon atom identified by the symbol * and/or ** has the (S) configuration. In this embodiment, compounds of formula I have the (S) configuration at the carbon atom identified by the symbol * and/or ** or are enriched in a stereoisomeric form having the (S) configuration at this carbon atom. It is understood that a compound may have a chiral center at both the * and the ** carbon atoms. In such cases, four possible diastereomers can exist. In some cases, in order to optimize the therapeutic activity of the compounds of the invention, for example, as hypertensive agents, it may be desirable that the carbon atom identified by the symbol * and/or ** have a particular (R) or (S) configuration. The compounds of the invention, as well as those compounds used in their synthesis, may also include isotopically-labeled compounds, that is, where one or more atoms have been enriched with atoms having an atomic mass different from the atomic mass predominately found in nature. Examples of isotopes that may be incorporated into the compounds of formula I, for example, include, but are not limited to, 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O, 17O, 35S, 36Cl, and 18F. The compounds of formula I have been found to possess AT1 receptor antagonizing activity and NEP enzyme inhibition activity. Among other properties, such compounds are expected to be useful as therapeutic agents for treating diseases such as hypertension. By combining dual activity into a single compound, double therapy can be achieved, that is, AT1 receptor antagonist activity and NEP enzyme inhibition activity can be obtained using a single active component. Since pharmaceutical compositions containing one active component are typically easier to formulate than compositions containing two active components, such single-component compositions provide a significant advantage over compositions containing two active components. In addition, certain compounds of the invention have also been found to be selective for inhibition of the AT1 receptor over the angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor, a property that may have therapeutic advantages. The nomenclature used herein to name the compounds of the invention is illustrated in the Examples herein. This nomenclature has been derived using the commercially available AutoNom software (MDL, San Leandro, Calif.).

DEFINITIONS When describing the compounds, compositions, methods and processes of the invention, the following terms have the following meanings unless otherwise indicated. Additionally, as used herein, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include the corresponding plural forms unless the context of use clearly dictates otherwise. The terms “comprising”, “including,” and “having” are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable” refers to a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable. For example, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to a material that can be incorporated into a composition and administered to a patient without causing undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with other components of the composition. Such pharmaceutically acceptable materials typically have met the required standards of toxicological and manufacturing testing, and include those materials identified as suitable inactive ingredients by the U.S. Food and Drug administration. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” means a salt prepared from a base or an acid which is acceptable for administration to a patient, such as a mammal (for example, salts having acceptable mammalian safety for a given dosage regime). However, it is understood that the salts covered by the invention are not required to be pharmaceutically acceptable salts, such as salts of intermediate compounds that are not intended for administration to a patient. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic bases and from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids. In addition, when a compound of formula I contains both a basic moiety, such as an amine, pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety such as a carboxylic acid or tetrazole, zwitterions may be formed and are included within the term “salt” as used herein. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic bases include ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, manganous, potassium, sodium, and zinc salts, and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic bases include salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, including substituted amines, cyclic amines, naturally-occurring amines and the like, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, hydrabamine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperadine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine and the like. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic acids include salts of boric, carbonic, hydrohalic (hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydrofluoric or hydroiodic), nitric, phosphoric, sulfamic and sulfuric acids. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic acids include salts of aliphatic hydroxyl acids (for example, citric, gluconic, glycolic, lactic, lactobionic, malic, and tartaric acids), aliphatic monocarboxylic acids (for example, acetic, butyric, formic, propionic and trifluoroacetic acids), amino acids (for example, aspartic and glutamic acids), aromatic carboxylic acids (for example, benzoic, p-chlorobenzoic, diphenylacetic, gentisic, hippuric, and triphenylacetic acids), aromatic hydroxyl acids (for example, o-hydroxybenzoic, p-hydroxybenzoic, 1-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic and 3-hydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acids), ascorbic, dicarboxylic acids (for example, fumaric, maleic, oxalic and succinic acids), glucoronic, mandelic, mucic, nicotinic, orotic, pamoic, pantothenic, sulfonic acids (for example, benzenesulfonic, camphosulfonic, edisylic, ethanesulfonic, isethionic, methanesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic, naphthalene-1,5-disulfonic, naphthalene-2,6-disulfonic and p-toluenesulfonic acids), xinafoic acid, and the like. As used herein, the term “prodrug” is intended to mean an inactive (or significantly less active) precursor of a drug that is converted into its active form in the body under physiological conditions, for example, by normal metabolic processes. The term is also intended to include certain protected derivatives of compounds of formula I that may be made prior to a final deprotection stage. Such compounds may not possess pharmacological activity at AT1 and/or NEP, but may be administered orally or parenterally and thereafter metabolized in the body to form compounds of the invention which are pharmacologically active at AT1 and/or NEP. Thus, all protected derivatives and prodrugs of compounds formula I are included within the scope of the invention. Prodrugs of compounds of formula I having a free carboxyl, sulfhydryl or hydroxy group can be readily synthesized by techniques that are well known in the art. These prodrug derivatives are then converted by solvolysis or under physiological conditions to be the free carboxyl, sulfhydryl and/or hydroxy compounds. Exemplary prodrugs include: esters including C1-6alkylesters and aryl-C1-6alkylesters, carbonate esters, hemi-esters, phosphate esters, nitro esters, sulfate esters, sulfoxides, amides, carbamates, azo-compounds, phosphamides, glycosides, ethers, acetals, ketals, and disulfides. In one embodiment, the compounds of formula I have a free sulfhydryl or a free carboxyl and the prodrug is an ester derivative. The term “solvate” means a complex or aggregate formed by one or more molecules of a solute, for example, a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and one or more molecules of a solvent. Such solvates are typically crystalline solids having a substantially fixed molar ratio of solute and solvent. Representative solvents include, by way of example, water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, acetic acid and the like. When the solvent is water, the solvate formed is a hydrate. The term “therapeutically effective amount” means an amount sufficient to effect treatment when administered to a patient in need thereof, that is, the amount of drug needed to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. For example, a therapeutically effective amount for treating hypertension could be the amount of drug needed to reduce blood pressure or the amount of drug needed to maintain normal blood pressure. On the other hand, the term “effective amount” means an amount sufficient to obtain a desired result, which may not necessary be a therapeutic result. For example, when studying a system comprising an AT1 receptor, an “effective amount” may be the amount needed to antagonize the receptor. The term “treating” or “treatment” as used herein means the treating or treatment of a disease or medical condition (such as hypertension) in a patient, such as a mammal (particularly a human) that includes: (a) preventing the disease or medical condition from occurring, that is, prophylactic treatment of a patient; (b) ameliorating the disease or medical condition such as by eliminating or causing regression of the disease or medical condition in a patient; (c) suppressing the disease or medical condition such as by slowing or arresting the development of the disease or medical condition in a patient; or (d) alleviating the symptoms of the disease or medical condition in a patient. For example, the term “treating hypertension” would include preventing hypertension from occurring, ameliorating hypertension, suppressing hypertension, and alleviating the symptoms of hypertension (for example, lowering blood pressure). The term “patient” is intended to include those mammals, such as humans, that are in need of treatment or disease prevention or that are presently being treated for disease prevention or treatment of a specific disease or medical condition. The term “patient” also includes test subjects in which compounds of the invention are being evaluated or test subjects being used in a assay, for example an animal model. The term “alkyl” means a monovalent saturated hydrocarbon group which may be linear or branched. Unless otherwise defined, such alkyl groups typically contain from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and include, for example, —C1-4alkyl, —C1-6alkyl, and —C1-10alkyl. Representative alkyl groups include, by way of example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, s-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, n-heptyl, n-octyl, n-nonyl, n-decyl and the like. When a specific number of carbon atoms is intended for a particular term used herein, the number of carbon atoms is shown preceding the term as subscript. For example, the term “—C1-6alkyl” means an alkyl group having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and the term “—C3-6cycloalkyl” means a cycloalkyl group having from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, where the carbon atoms are in any acceptable configuration. The term “alkylene” means a divalent saturated hydrocarbon group that may be linear or branched. Unless otherwise defined, such alkylene groups typically contain from 0 to 10 carbon atoms and include, for example, —C0-1alkylene-, —C0-2alkylene-, —C0-3alkylene-, —C0-5alkylene-, —C0-6alkylene-, —C1-2alkylene- and —C1-12alkylene-. Representative alkylene groups include, by way of example, methylene, ethane-1,2-diyl (“ethylene”), propane-1,2-diyl, propane-1,3-diyl, butane-1,4-diyl, pentane-1,5-diyl and the like. It is understood that when the alkylene term include zero carbons such as —C0-1alkylene- or —C0-5alkylene-, such terms are intended to include a single bond. The term “alkylthio” means a monovalent group of the formula —S-alkyl, where alkyl is as defined herein. Unless otherwise defined, such alkylthio groups typically contain from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and include, for example, —S—C1-4alkyl and —S—C1-6alkyl. Representative alkylthio groups include, by way of example, ethylthio, propylthio, isopropylthio, butylthio, s-butylthio and t-butylthio. The term “alkenyl” means a monovalent unsaturated hydrocarbon group which may be linear or branched and which has at least one, and typically 1, 2 or 3, carbon-carbon double bonds. Unless otherwise defined, such alkenyl groups typically contain from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and include, for example, —C2-4alkenyl and —C2-10alkenyl. Representative alkenyl groups include, by way of example, ethenyl, n-propenyl, isopropenyl, n-but-2-enyl, n-hex-3-enyl and the like. The term “alkenylene” means a divalent alkenyl group, and includes groups such as —C2-3alkenylene-. The term “alkoxy” means a monovalent group of the formula —O-alkyl, where alkyl is as defined herein. Unless otherwise defined, such alkoxy groups typically contain from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and include, for example, —O—C1-4alkyl and —O—C1-6alkyl. Representative alkoxy groups include, by way of example, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, isopropoxy, n-butoxy, sec-butoxy, isobutoxy, t-butoxy and the like. The term “alkynyl” means a monovalent unsaturated hydrocarbon group which may be linear or branched and which has at least one, and typically 1, 2 or 3, carbon-carbon triple bonds. Unless otherwise defined, such alkynyl groups typically contain from 2 to 10 carbon atoms and include, for example, —C2-4alkynyl and —C3-10alkynyl. Representative alkynyl groups include, by way of example, ethynyl, n-propynyl, n-but-2-ynyl, n-hex-3-ynyl and the like. The term “alkynylene” means a divalent alkynyl group and includes groups such as —C2-3alkynylene. Amino acid residues are often designated as —C(O)—CHR—NH—, where the R moiety is referred to as the “amino acid side chain.” Thus, for the amino acid valine, HO—C(O)—CH[—CH(CH3)2]—NH2, the side chain is —CH(CH3)2. The term “amino acid side chain” is intended to include side chains of the twenty common naturally occurring amino acids: alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine. Of particular interest are the side chains of non-polar amino acids such as isoleucine, leucine, and valine. The term “aryl” means a monovalent aromatic hydrocarbon having a single ring (for example, phenyl) or fused rings. Fused ring systems include those that are fully unsaturated (for example, naphthalene) as well as those that are partially unsaturated (for example, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene). Unless otherwise defined, such aryl groups typically contain from 6 to 10 carbon ring atoms and include, for example, —C6-10aryl. Representative aryl groups include, by way of example, phenyl and naphthalene-1-yl, naphthalene-2-yl, and the like. The term “arylene” means a divalent aryl group such as phenylene. The term “cycloalkyl” means a monovalent saturated carbocyclic hydrocarbon group. Unless otherwise defined, such cycloalkyl groups typically contain from 3 to 10 carbon atoms and include, for example, —C3-5cycloalkyl, —C3-6cycloalkyl and —C3-7cycloalkyl. Representative cycloalkyl groups include, by way of example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl and the like. The term “cycloalkylene” means a divalent aryl group such as —C4-8cycloalkylene. The term “halo” means fluoro, chloro, bromo and iodo. The term “heteroaryl” means a monovalent aromatic group having a single ring or two fused rings and containing in the ring(s) at least one heteroatom (typically 1 to 3) selected from nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur. Unless otherwise defined, such heteroaryl groups typically contain from 5 to 10 total ring atoms and include, for example, —C2-9heteroaryl. Representative heteroaryl groups include, by way of example, monovalent species of pyrrole, imidazole, thiazole, oxazole, furan, thiophene, triazole, pyrazole, isoxazole, isothiazole, pyridine, pyrazine, pyridazine, pyrimidine, triazine, indole, benzofuran, benzothiophene, benzoimidazole, benzthiazole, quinoline, isoquinoline, quinazoline, quinoxaline and the like, where the point of attachment is at any available carbon or nitrogen ring atom. The term “optionally substituted” means that group in question may be unsubstituted or it may be substituted one or several times, such as 1 to 3 times or 1 to 5 times. For example, an alkyl group that is “optionally substituted” with 1 to 5 fluoro atoms, may be unsubstituted, or it may contain 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 fluoro atoms. The term “protected derivatives thereof” means a derivative of the specified compound in which one or more functional groups of the compound are protected or blocked from undergoing undesired reactions with a protecting or blocking group. Functional groups that may be protected include, by way of example, carboxy groups, amino groups, hydroxyl groups, thiol groups, carbonyl groups and the like. Representative protecting groups for carboxy groups include esters (such as a p-methoxybenzyl ester), amides and hydrazides; for amino groups, carbamates (such as t-butoxycarbonyl) and amides; for hydroxyl groups, ethers and esters; for thiol groups, thioethers and thioesters; for carbonyl groups, acetals and ketals; and the like. Such protecting groups are well-known to those skilled in the art and are described, for example, in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Wiley, New York, 1999, and references cited therein. All other terms used herein are intended to have their ordinary meaning as understood by those of ordinary skill in the art to which they pertain. General Synthetic Procedures Compounds of the invention can be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods, the procedures set forth in the Examples, or by using other methods, reagents, and starting materials that are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Although the following procedures may illustrate a particular embodiment of the invention, it is understood that other embodiments of the invention can be similarly prepared using the same or similar methods or by using other methods, reagents and starting materials known to those of ordinary skill in the art. It will also be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (for example, reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. While optimum reaction conditions will typically vary depending on various reaction parameters such as the particular reactants, solvents and quantities used, those of ordinary skill in the art can readily determine suitable reaction conditions using routine optimization procedures. Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary or desired to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. The choice of a suitable protecting group for a particular functional group as well as suitable conditions and reagents for protection and deprotection of such functional groups are well-known in the art. Protecting groups other than those illustrated in the procedures described herein may be used, if desired. For example, numerous protecting groups, and their introduction and removal, are described in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Wiley, New York, 1999, and references cited therein. More specifically, the following abbreviations and reagents are used in the schemes presented below: P1 represents an “amino-protecting group,” a term used herein to mean a protecting group suitable for preventing undesired reactions at an amino group. Representative amino-protecting groups include, but are not limited to, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), trityl (Tr), benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), formyl, trimethylsilyl (TMS), t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), and the like. Standard deprotection techniques are used to remove the P1 group. For example, deprotection of an N—BOC group can involve reagents such as TFA in DCM or HCl in 1,4-dioxane, while a Cbz group can be removed by employing catalytic hydrogenation conditions such as H2 (1 atm), 10% Pd/C in an alcoholic solvent. P2 represents a “carboxy-protecting group,” a term used herein to mean a protecting group suitable for preventing undesired reactions at a carboxy group. Representative carboxy-protecting groups include, but are not limited to, methyl, ethyl, t-butyl, benzyl (Bn), p-methoxybenzyl (PMB), 9-fluorenylmethyl (Fm), trimethylsilyl (TMS), t-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS), diphenylmethyl (benzhydryl, DPM) and the like. Standard deprotection techniques and reagents are used to remove the P2 group, and may vary depending upon which group is used. For example, NaOH is commonly used when P2 is methyl, an acid such as TFA or HCl is commonly used when P2 is t-butyl, and catalytic hydrogenation condition such as H2 (1 atm) and 10% Pd/C in alcoholic solvent (“H2/Pd/C”) may be used when P2 is benzyl. P3 represents a “thiol-protecting group,” a term used herein to mean a protecting group suitable for preventing undesired reactions at a thiol group. Representative thiol-protecting groups include, but are not limited to, ethers, esters such as —C(O)CH3, and the like. Standard deprotection techniques and reagents such as NaOH, primary alkylamines, and hydrazine, may be used to remove the P3 group. P4 represents a “tetrazole-protecting group,” a term used herein to mean a protecting group suitable for preventing undesired reactions at a tetrazole group. Representative tetrazole-protecting groups include, but are not limited to trityl and diphenylmethyl. Standard deprotection techniques and reagents such as TFA in DCM or HCl in 1,4-dioxane may be used to remove the P4 group. P5 represents a “hydroxyl-protecting group,” a term that is used herein to mean a protecting group suitable for preventing undesired reactions at a hydroxyl group. Representative hydroxyl-protecting groups include, but are not limited to C1-6alkyls, silyl groups including triC1-6alkylsilyl groups, such as trimethylsilyl (TMS), triethylsilyl (TES), and tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS); esters (acyl groups) including C1-6alkanoyl groups, such as formyl, acetyl, and pivaloyl, and aromatic acyl groups such as benzoyl; arylmethyl groups such as benzyl (Bn), p-methoxybenzyl (PMB), 9-fluorenylmethyl (Fm), and diphenylmethyl (benzhydryl, DPM); and the like. Standard deprotection techniques and reagents are used to remove the P5 group, and may vary depending upon which group is used. For example, H2/Pd/C is commonly used when P5 is benzyl, while NaOH is commonly used when P5 is an acyl group. P6 represents a “sulfonamide-protecting group,” a term that is used herein to mean a protecting group suitable for preventing undesired reactions at a sulfonamide group. Representative sulfonamide-protecting groups include, but are not limited to t-butyl and acyl groups. Exemplary acyl groups include aliphatic lower acyl groups such as the formyl, acetyl, phenylacetyl, butyryl, isobutyryl, valeryl, isovaleryl and pivaloyl groups, and aromatic acyl groups such as the benzoyl and 4-acetoxybenzoyl. Standard deprotection techniques and reagents are used to remove the P6 group, and may vary depending upon which group is used. For example, HCl is commonly used when P6 is t-butyl, while NaOH is commonly used when P6 is an acyl group. P7 represents a “phosphate-protecting group or phosphinate-protecting group,” a term used herein to mean a protecting group suitable for preventing undesired reactions at a phosphate or phosphinate group. Representative phosphate and phosphinate protecting groups include, but are not limited to C1-4alkyls, aryl (for example, phenyl) and substituted aryls (for example, chlorophenyl and methylphenyl). The protected group can be represented by —P(O)(OR)2, where R is a group such as a C1-6alkyl or phenyl. Standard deprotection techniques and reagents such as TMS-I/2,6-lutidine, and H2/Pd/C are used to remove the P7 group such as ethyl, and benzyl, respectively. In addition, L is used to designate a “leaving group,” a term used herein to mean a functional group or atom which can be displaced by another functional group or atom in a substitution reaction, such as a nucleophilic substitution reaction. By way of example, representative leaving groups include chloro, bromo and iodo groups; sulfonic ester groups, such as mesylate, triflate, tosylate, brosylate, nosylate and the like; and acyloxy groups, such as acetoxy, trifluoroacetoxy and the like. Suitable bases for use in these schemes include, by way of illustration and not limitation, potassium carbonate, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, triethylamine, pyridine, 1,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA), sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, potassium t-butoxide, and metal hydrides. Suitable inert diluents or solvents for use in these schemes include, by way of illustration and not limitation, tetrahydrofuran (THF), acetonitrile (MeCN), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), toluene, dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CHCl3), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), 1,4-dioxane, methanol, ethanol, water, and the like. Suitable carboxylic acid/amine coupling reagents include benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), benzotriazol-1-yloxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP), O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU), dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC), carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), and the like. Coupling reactions are conducted in an inert diluent in the presence of a base, and are performed under conventional amide bond-forming conditions. All reactions are typically conducted at a temperature within the range of about −78° C. to 100° C., for example at room temperature. Reactions may be monitored by use of thin layer chromatography (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and/or LCMS until completion. Reactions may be complete in minutes, or may take hours, typically from 1-2 hours and up to 48 hours. Upon completion, the resulting mixture or reaction product may be further treated in order to obtain the desired product. For example, the resulting mixture or reaction product may be subjected to one or more of the following procedures: concentrating or partitioning (for example, between EtOAc and water or between 5% THF in EtOAc and 1M phosphoric acid); extraction (for example, with EtOAc, CHCl3, DCM, HCl); washing (for example, with saturated aqueous NaCl, saturated NaHCO3, Na2CO3 (5%), CHCl3 or 1M NaOH); drying (for example, over MgSO4, over Na2SO4, or in vacuo); filtering; crystallizing (for example, from EtOAc and hexane); and/or being concentrated (for example, in vacuo). By way of illustration, compounds of formula I, as well as their salts, solvates, and prodrugs can be prepared by one or more of the following exemplary processes. Scheme I Peptide Coupling Reaction and Optional Deprotection The X moiety contains one or more amide groups, and therefore the compounds of the invention may be formed by a coupling reaction under conventional amide bond-forming conditions, followed by a deprotection step if needed. In Scheme I, the A and B moieties couple to form X, and the sum of a and b is in the range of 0 to 11. Thus, one moiety comprises an amine group and one moiety comprises a carboxylic acid group, i.e., A is —NH2 and B is —COOH or A is —COOH and B is —NH2. For example, to synthesize a compound of formula I where X is —CONH—, A would be —COOH and B would be —NH2. Similarly, A as —NH2 and B as —COOH would couple to form —NHCO— as the X moiety. A and B can be readily modified if a longer X is desired, whether it contains an alkylene portion or additional amide groups. For example, A as —CH2NH2 and B as —COOH would couple to form —CH2NHCO— as the X moiety. It is understood that the carbon atoms in the —(CH2)a and —(CH2)b groups make up the “X” linker. Therefore, these carbon atoms may be substituted with one or more R4b groups. Furthermore, one —CH2— group in the —(CH2)a or the —(CH2)b group may be replaced with a —C4-8cycloalkylene-, —CR4d═CH—, or —CH═CR4d— group. Ar* represents Ar—R1*, where R1* may represent R1 as defined herein, or a protected form of R1 (for example, -tetrazol-5-yl-P4 or —C(O)O—P2 such as —C(O)O—C1-6alkyl), or a precursor of R1 (for example, —CN that is then converted to tetrazole, or nitro that is then converted to amino from which the desired R1 is prepared). R5* represents R5 as defined herein, or a protected form of R5. Therefore, when R1* represents R1 and R5* represents R5, the reaction is complete after the coupling step. On the other hand, when R1* represents a protected form of R1 and/or R5* represents a protected form of R5, a subsequent global or sequential deprotection step would yield the non-protected compound. Similarly, when R1* represents a precursor of R1, a subsequent conversion step would yield the desired compound. Reagents and conditions for the deprotection vary with the nature of protecting groups in the compound. Typical deprotection conditions when R5* represents C0-3alkylene-S—P3, include treating the compound with NaOH in an alcoholic solvent at 0° C. or room temperature to yield the non-protected compound. Typical deprotection conditions when R1* represents C(O)O—P2 where P2 refers to t-butyl include treating the compound with TFA in DCM at room temperature to yield the non-protected compound. Thus, one method of preparing compounds of the invention involves coupling compounds (1) and (2), with an optional deprotection step when R1* is a protected form of R1 and/or R5* is a protected form of R5, thus forming a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Examples of compound (1) include: 4′-(5-aminomethyl-2-butyl-4-chloroimidazol-1-ylmethyl)biphenyl-2-carboxylic acid t-butyl ester; 2-butyl-3-(4-methoxycarbonylbenzyl)-3H-imidazole-4-carboxylic acid; 4-(5-aminomethyl-2-butyl-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-2,3-difluorobenzoic acid methyl ester; C-{2-butyl-3-[2′-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-biphenyl-4-ylmethyl]-3H-imidazol-4-yl}methylamine; 4′-(3-aminomethyl-5-propyl[1,2,4]triazol-4-ylmethyl)biphenyl-2-carboxylic acid; 4′-(3-aminomethyl-6-butyl-2-oxo-2H-pyridin-1-ylmethyl)biphenyl-2-carboxylic acid; 4′-(5-aminomethyl-2-ethoxy-4-ethylimidazol-1-ylmethyl)biphenyl-2-carboxylic acid t-butyl ester; 4′-(5-aminomethyl-2-ethoxy-4-ethylimidazol-1-ylmethyl)-3′-fluorobiphenyl-2-carboxylic acid t-butyl ester; 4′-(5-aminomethyl-2-propoxy-4-ethylimidazol-1-ylmethyl)-3′-fluorobiphenyl-2-carboxylic acid t-butyl ester; and 4′-(5-aminomethyl-4-chloro-2-ethoxyimidazol-1-ylmethyl)-3′-fluorobiphenyl-2-carboxylic acid t-butyl ester. Examples of compound (2) include: (R)-1-benzyl-2-hydroxycarbamoylethyl)-carbamic acid; (R)-2-((R)-2-amino-3-phenylpropyldisulfanyl)-1-benzylethylamine; (S)-2-acetylsulfanyl-4-methylpentanoic acid; 2-acetylsulfanylmethyl-4-methyl-pentanoic acid and (S)-2-acetylsulfanylmethyl-4-methylpentanoic acid; and (R)-2-(2-benzyloxycarbamoyl-3-phenypropionylamino)succinic acid 1-methyl ester. Compound (1) Compound (1) can be prepared by the following reaction: Compounds (1a) and (1b) are combined with K2CO3 in a solvent such as DMF to form intermediate (1c), which then undergoes oxime formation by reaction with hydroxylamine hydrochloride (NH2OH.HCl) in pyridine to form intermediate (1d). Intermediate (1d) is reacted with NaBH3CN, NH4OAc, and TiCl3, in a solvent such as MeOH, to form Compound (1) where A is —NH(R4a). Compound (1) where A is —COOH can be formed by reacting intermediate (1c) with 2-methyl-2-butene, sodium dihydrogen phosphate and sodium chlorite. Compound (1a) Compound (1a) can be readily prepared by techniques that are well known in the art and/or is commercially available. Examples of compound (1a) include 2-butyl-5-chloro-3H-imidazole-4-carbaldehyde, 5-bromo-2-butyl-3H-imidazole-4-carbaldehyde, 5-bromo-2-ethoxy-3H-imidazole-4-carbaldehyde, bromo-2-propoxy-3H-imidazole-4-carbaldehyde, and 5-chloro-2-ethoxy-3H-imidazole-4-carbaldehyde, all of which are either commercially available or are readily synthesized by techniques that are well known in the art. For example: 5-bromo-2-butyl-3H-imidazole-4-carbaldehyde can be made reacting 2-butyl-3H-imidazole-4-carbaldehyde with N-bromosuccinimide in a suitable solvent such as DMF; 5-bromo-2-ethoxy-3H-imidazole-4-carbaldehyde can be prepared by reacting 2,4,5-tribromo-1H-imidazole with [β-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy]methyl chloride, followed by reaction with potassium t-butoxide in ethanol, then n-butyllithium and DMF, with a final deprotection step; and 5-chloro-2-ethoxy-3H-imidazole-4-carbaldehyde can be prepared by reacting 4,5-dibromo-2-ethoxy-1-(2-trimethylsilanylethoxymethyl)-1H-imidazole and hexachloroethane then DMF, both steps conducted with n-butyllithium, N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine, and appropriate solvents, with a final deprotection step. Compound (1b) The starting material (1e) can be prepared using synthetic methods that are reported in the literature, for example Duncia et al. (1991) J. Org. Chem. 56: 2395-400, and references cited therein. Alternatively, the starting material in a protected form (1f) may be commercially available. Using a commercially available non-protected starting material (1e), the R1 group is first protected to form protected intermediate (1f), then the leaving group (L) is added to form compound (1b), for example, by a halogenation reaction. For example, a bromination reaction of a methyl group of N-triphenylmethyl-5-[4′-methylbiphenyl-2-yl]tetrazole is described in Chao et al. (2005) J. Chinese Chem. Soc. 52:539-544. In addition, when Ar* has a —CN group, it can be subsequently converted to the desired tetrazolyl group, which may be protected. Conversion of the nitrile group is readily achieved by reaction with a suitable azide such as sodium azide, trialkyltin azide (particularly tributyltin azide) or triaryltin azide. Compound (1b) when Ar has one of the remaining formulas is readily synthesized using similar techniques or other methods as are well known in the art. Exemplary methods of preparing compound (1b) include the following. A solution of the starting material (1e) and thionyl chloride are stirred at room temperature. After completion, the reaction is concentrated in vacuo to afford a solid, which is dissolved in a solvent such as THF and cooled to 0° C. Potassium t-butoxide is then added. Upon completion, the reaction is partitioned between EtOAc and water. The organic layer is washed with saturated aqueous NaCl, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated to afford compound (1f). Alternately, HCl is added to a solution of the starting material (1e) and a solvent such as methanol. The reaction is heated to reflux and stirred until completion (˜48 hours), then cooled and concentrated. The recovered material is dried in vacuo to obtain intermediate (1f). Intermediate (1f), benzoyl peroxide, and N-bromosuccinimide are dissolved in CCl4 or benzene, and heated to reflux. The reaction is stirred to completion, cooled to room temperature, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue is crystallized from diethyl ether and hexane or flash chromatographed to give compound (1b). Examples of compound (1e) include: 4′-methylbiphenyl-2-carboxylic acid; 2,3-difluoro-4-methyl-benzoic acid; and 2-fluoro-4-methylbenzoic acid. Examples of compound (1f) include N-triphenylmethyl-5-[4′-methylbiphenyl-2-yl]tetrazole. Compound (1b) where R1 is —SO2NHR1d may be synthesized as follows: The starting material, 2-bromobenzene-1-sulfonamide, is commercially available. Reaction of 2-bromobenzene-1-sulfonamide in a solvent such as DMF, with 1,1-dimethoxy-N,N-dimethylmethanamine, followed by the addition of sodium hydrogen sulfate in water, yields 2-bromo-N-[1-dimethylaminometh-(E)-ylidene]benzenesulfonamide. This compound is reacted with 4-methylphenylboronic acid to yield 4′-methylbiphenyl-2-sulfonic acid 1-dimethylaminometh-(E)-ylideneamide, then the —(CH2)r-L1 moiety is added, for example, by a halogenation reaction, to form compound (1b). Compound (1b) where the Ar moiety is substituted may be synthesized as follows: The starting material, 2-bromobenzoic acid, is commercially available. Reaction of 2-bromobenzoic acid in a suitable solvent, with t-butyl alcohol, DCC and DMAP, yields 2-bromo-benzoic acid t-butyl ester. This compound is reacted with 3-fluoro-4-methylphenylboronic acid to yield 3′-fluoro-4′-methyl-biphenyl-2-carboxylic acid t-butyl ester, then the —(CH2)r-L1 moiety is added, for example, by a halogenation reaction, to form compound (1b). Examples of compound (1b) include 5-(4′-bromomethylbiphenyl-2-yl)-1-trityl-1H-tetrazole; 4′-bromomethylbiphenyl-2-carboxylic acid t-butyl ester; 4-bromomethylbenzoic acid methyl ester; 4-bromomethyl-2,3-difluorobenzoic acid methyl ester; 4′-formyl-biphenyl-2-sulfonic acid t-butylamide; 4′-aminomethylbiphenyl-2-carboxylic acid t-butyl ester; and 4′-bromomethyl-3′-fluorobiphenyl-2-carboxylic acid t-butyl ester. Compound (2) Compound (2) is readily synthesized by following the techniques described in the literature, for example, Neustadt et al (1994) J. Med. Chem. 37:2461-2476 and Moree et al. (1995) J. Org. Chem. 60: 5157-69, as well as by using the exemplary procedures described below.

The solid is suspended in MeCN, then concentrated under reduced pressure. The recovered material is dissolved in 4M HCl in 1,4-dioxane and stirred at room temperature until the reaction is complete (˜2 hours).

The product is purified by silica gel chromatography. Examples of compound (2e) include (R)-2-bromo-4-methylpentanoic acid. Examples of compound (2iii) include (S)-2-acetylsulfanyl-4-methylpentanoic acid. Preparation of Sulfanyl Acid Compound (2iv) Compound (2f) is mixed with diethylamine and cooled in an ice bath. An aqueous formaldehyde solution (37%) is then added, and the mixture stirred at 0° C. for approximately 2 hours, warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. The mixture is then extracted with ether, washed, dried, and evaporated to dryness, to provide compound (2g). Compound (2g) is then dissolved in 1,4-dioxane, and a 1M NaOH solution is added. The mixture is stirred at room temperature until completion (approximately 2 days). The organic solvent is removed in vacuo, and the aqueous residue is rinsed with EtOAc and acidified to approximately pH 1 with concentrated HCl. The product is extracted with EtOAc, dried, and evaporated to dryness to yield compound (2h). Compound (2h) is combined with thiolacetic acid (10 mL), and the mixture is stirred at 80° C. until completion (approximately 2 hours), then concentrated to dryness to yield compound (2iv), which is dissolved in toluene and concentrated to remove any trace of thiolacetic acid. Examples of compound (2f) include 2-benzylmalonic acid monoethyl ester (R6=benzyl) and 2-isobutylmalonic acid monoethyl ester (R6=isobutyl). Preparation of Chiral Sulfanyl Acid Compound (2v) Compound (2i), (S)-4-benzyl-2-oxazolidinone, is commercially available. Compound (2j) is also typically commercially available or can be readily synthesized. For example, R6—CH2—COOH (for example, isocaproic acid or 3-phenylpropionic acid) is dissolved in methylene chloride and thionyl chloride is added. The mixture is stirred at room temperature until the reaction is complete (for example, overnight), and then concentrated to provide (2j). Examples of compound (2j) include 4-methylpentanoyl chloride and 3-phenylpropionyl chloride. Compound (2i) is dissolved in a suitable solvent and cooled (−78° C.) under nitrogen. n-Butyllithium in hexanes is added dropwise and stirred, followed by the addition of (2j) dropwise. The mixture is stirred at −78° C., then warmed to 0° C. Saturated NaHCO3 is added and the mixture warmed to room temperature. The mixture is extracted, washed, dried, filtered, and concentrated to afford (2k). Compound (2k) is dissolved in DCM and stirred at 0° C. under nitrogen. 1M Titanium tetrachloride is added, followed by 1,3,5-trioxane, all in appropriate solvents. A second equivalent of 1M titanium tetrachloride is added and the mixture stirred at 0° C. until the reaction is complete. The reaction is then quenched with saturated ammonium chloride. Appropriate solvents are added, the aqueous phase is extracted, and the organic layers are combined, dried, filtered, and concentrated to provide (2l), which can then be purified by silica gel chromatography or used in the next step without further purification. Compound (2l) is dissolved in a solvent, to which is added 9 M hydrogen peroxide in water, followed by the dropwise addition of 1.5 M lithium hydroxide monohydrate in water. The mixture is warmed to room temperature and stirred. Optionally, potassium hydroxide may be added and the mixture heated at 60° C. then cooled at room temperature. To this is added an aqueous solution of sodium sulfite followed by water and chloroform. The aqueous layer is extracted, acidified and extracted again. The organic layer is washed, dried, filtered, and rotovaped to provide (2m). Triphenylphosphine is dissolved in an appropriate solvent and cooled at 0° C. (ice bath). Diisopropyl azodicarboxylate is added dropwise and the mixture stirred. Compound (2m) and thioacetic acid, dissolved in an appropriate solvent, are added dropwise to the mixture. After the addition, the mixture is removed from the ice bath and stirred at room temperature until the reaction is complete (approximately 3.5 hours), concentrated, and then partitioned. The organic layer is extracted and the combined aqueous extracts washed, acidified and extracted. The organic layer is washed again, dried, filtered, and rotovaped to provide compound (2v). Examples of compound (2v) include (S)-2-acetylsulfanylmethyl-4-methylpentanoic acid. Scheme II Peptide Coupling Reaction Compounds of formula I can also be prepared by coupling compound (3) and compound (1) where A is —COOH, followed by reaction with compound (4). In compounds (1) and (3), the sum of a and b is in the range of 0 to 11. In compounds (3) and (4), the [R5] and [[R5]] moieties represent portions of the R5 moiety. For example, if R5 is —CH2C(O)N(OH)H, then [R5] would be —CH2C(O)— and [[R5]] would be —N(OH)H. The amide coupling of compounds (1) and (3) is typically conducted at room temperature with coupling reagents such as pentafluorophenol combined with EDC and DIPEA in solvents such as DMF. Compounds (3) and (4) are available commercially or can be readily synthesized by techniques that are well known in the art. Examples of compound (3) include 3-amino-4-(3-chlorophenyl)butyric acid. Examples of compound (4) include H2NOH, H2NO-benzyl, and H2NO-t-butyl. Scheme III Peptide Coupling Reaction Compounds of formula I can also be prepared by coupling compounds (1) and (5) under conventional amide bond-forming conditions. This synthesis is particularly useful for preparing compounds of formula I where more than one —CH2— moiety in the alkylene is replaced with —NR4a—C(O)— or —C(O)—NR4a—. In the compounds depicted below, b will typically be at least 1 and the sum of a, b and c is in the range of 1 to 10. Compound (5) is formed by converting the ester compound (6) to the acid with a base, converting the acid to the dioxopyrrolidinyl ester with N-hydroxysuccinimide, then converting the dioxopyrrolidinyl ester with compound (7) to form compound (5). Compound (5) may have one or more R4b substituents on the carbon atoms in the —(CH2)b— and/or —(CH2)c— portions. Compound (6) can be readily synthesized by following the techniques described in the literature, for example, Fournie-Zaluski et al. (1985) J. Med. Chem. 28(9): 1158-1169). Examples of compound (6) include 2-benzyl-N-benzyloxymalonamic acid ethyl ester. Compound (7) is available commercially or can be readily synthesized by techniques that are well known in the art. This reactant is particularly useful where a carbon atom in the alkylene moiety in X is substituted with an R4b group. For example, 2-aminosuccinic acid 1-methyl ester is an example of compound (7) that is useful for preparing compounds where R4b is —COOH, where the R4b moiety is in a protected form, —COOMe. Scheme IV Two-Step Reaction Compounds of formula I can also be prepared by a two-step method, where the first step involves the addition of a halogen-substituted alkanoic acid (“L-acid”) such as α-bromoisocaproic acid to compound (1), to provide Intermediate (8), where L is a leaving group such as bromo. Intermediate (8) is then reacted with a thiol or sulfur-containing nucleophilic reactant that contains the desired R5* group, for example, potassium thioacetate or thiourea. If desired, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula I can be prepared by contacting the free acid or base form of a compound of formula I with a pharmaceutically acceptable base or acid. Scheme V Pro-Drug Synthesis Prodrugs can be readily synthesized using the techniques described above. In addition, prodrugs can be formed by further modifying active compounds of formula I where Ar**—COOH represents Ar—R1 and R5 is —C0-3alkylene-SH, as shown below: Thus, both prodrug A and prodrug C can be readily synthesized from the corresponding active prodrug. Certain intermediates described herein are believed to be novel and accordingly, such compounds are provided as further aspects of the invention including, for example, the compounds of formulas VIII, IX and X, and salts thereof: Where Ar* is Ar—R1*; Ar, r, Y, Z, Q, W, X, and R5-7 are as defined for formula I; and R1* is selected from —C(O)O—P2, —SO2O—P5, —SO2NH—P6, —P(O)(O—P7)2, —OCH(CH3)—C(O)O—P2, —OCH(aryl)-C(O)O—P2, and tetrazol-5-yl-P4; where P2 is a carboxy-protecting group, P4 is a tetrazole-protecting group, P5 is a hydroxyl-protecting group, P6 is a sulfonamide-protecting group, and P7 is a phosphate-protecting group; Where Ar, r, Y, Z, Q, W, X, and R6-7 are as defined for formula I; R5* is selected from —C0-3alkylene-S—P3, —C0-3alkylene-C(O)NH(O—P5), —C0-3alkylene-N(O—P5)—C(O)R5d, —C0-1alkylene-NHC(O)CH2S—P3, —NH—C0-1alkylene-P(O)(O—P7)2, —C0-3alkylene-P(O)(O—P7)—R5e, —C0-2alkylene-CHR5f—C(O)O—P2 and —C0-3alkylene-C(O)NR5g—CHR5h—C(O)O—P2; and R5d-h are as defined for formula I; where P2 is a carboxy-protecting group, P3 is a thiol-protecting group, P5 is a hydroxyl-protecting group, and P7 is a phosphate-protecting group; and Where Ar* is Ar—R1*; Ar, r, Y, Z, Q, W, X, and R6-7 are as defined for formula I; R1* is selected from —C(O)O—P2, —SO2O—P5, —SO2NH—P6, —P(O)(O—P7)2, —OCH(CH3)—C(O)O—P2, —OCH(aryl)-C(O)O—P2, and tetrazol-5-yl-P4; R5* is selected from is selected from —C0-3alkylene-S—P3, —C0-3alkylene-C(O)NH(O—P5), —C0-3alkylene-N(O—P5)—C(O)R5d, —C0-1 alkylene-NHC(O)CH2S—P3, —NH—C0-1alkylene-P(O)(O—P7)2, —C0-3alkylene-P(O)(O—P7)—R5e, —C0-2alkylene-CHR5f—C(O)O—P2 and —C0-3alkylene-C(O)NR5g—CHR5h—C(O)O—P2; and R5d-h are as defined for formula I; where P2 is a carboxy-protecting group, P3 is a thiol-protecting group, P4 is a tetrazole-protecting group, P5 is a hydroxyl-protecting group, P6 is a sulfonamide-protecting group, and P7 is a phosphate-protecting group. Thus, another method of preparing compounds of the invention involves deprotecting a compound of formula VIII, IX, or X. Further details regarding specific reaction conditions and other procedures for preparing representative compounds of the invention or intermediates thereof are described in the Examples set forth below. Utility Compounds of the invention possess angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist activity. In one embodiment, compounds of the invention are selective for inhibition of the AT1 receptor over the AT2 receptor. Compounds of the invention also possess neprilysin (NEP) inhibition activity, that is, the compounds are able to inhibit enzyme-substrate activity. In another embodiment, the compounds do not exhibit significant inhibitory activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. Compounds of formula I may be active drugs as well as prodrugs. Thus, when discussing the activity of compounds of the invention, it is understood that any such prodrugs have the expected activity once metabolized. One measure of the affinity of a compound for the AT1 receptor is the inhibitory constant (Ki) for binding to the AT1 receptor. The pKi value is the negative logarithm to base 10 of the Ki. One measure of the ability of a compound to inhibit NEP activity is the inhibitory concentration (IC50), which is the concentration of compound that results in half-maximal inhibition of substrate conversion by the NEP enzyme. The pIC50 value is the negative logarithm to base 10 of the IC50. Compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof that have both AT1 receptor-antagonizing activity and NEP enzyme-inhibiting activity are of particular interest, including those that exhibit a pKi at the AT1 receptor greater than or equal to about 5.0, and exhibit a pIC50 for NEP greater than or equal to about 5.0. In one embodiment, compounds of interest have a pKi at the AT1 receptor≧about 6.0, a pKi at the AT1 receptor≧about 7.0, or a pKi at the AT1 receptor≧about 8.0. Compounds of interest also include those having a pIC50 for NEP≧about 6.0 or a pIC50 for NEP≧about 7.0. In another embodiment, compounds of interest have a pKi at the AT1 receptor within the range of about 8.0-10.0 and a pIC50 for NEP within the range of about 7.0-10.0. In another embodiment, compounds of particular interest have a pKi for binding to an AT1 receptor greater than or equal to about 7.5 and a NEP enzyme pIC50 greater than or equal to about 7.0. In another embodiment, compounds of interest have a pKi greater than or equal to about 8.0 and a pIC50 greater than or equal to about 8.0. It is noted that in some cases, compounds of the invention, while still having dual activity, may possess either weak AT1 receptor antagonist activity or weak NEP inhibition activity. In such cases, those of skill in the art will recognize that these compounds still have utility as primarily either a NEP inhibitor or a AT1 receptor antagonist, respectively, or have utility as research tools. Exemplary assays to determine properties of compounds of the invention, such as the AT1 receptor binding and/or NEP inhibiting activity, are described in the Examples and include by way of illustration and not limitation, assays that measure AT1 and AT2 binding (described in Assay 1), and NEP inhibition (described in Assay 2). Useful secondary assays include assays to measure ACE inhibition (also described in Assay 2) and aminopeptidase P (APP) inhibition (described in Sulpizio et al. (2005) JPET 315:1306-1313). A pharmacodynamic assay to assess the in vivo inhibitory potencies for ACE, AT1, and NEP in anesthetized rats is described in Assay 3 (see also Seymour et al. Hypertension 7(Suppl I):I-35-I-42, 1985 and Wigle et al. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 70:1525-1528, 1992), where AT1 inhibition is measured as the percent inhibition of the angiotensin II pressor response, ACE inhibition is measured as the percent inhibition of the angiotensin I pressor response, and NEP inhibition is measured as increased urinary cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP) output. Useful in vivo assays include the conscious spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model, which is a renin dependent hypertension model useful for measuring AT1 receptor blocking (described in Assay 4; see also Intengan et al. (1999) Circulation 100(22):2267-2275 and Badyal et al. (2003) Indian Journal of Pharmacology 35:349-362), and the conscious desoxycorticosterone acetate-salt (DOCA-salt) rat model, which is a volume dependent hypertension model useful for measuring NEP activity (described in Assay 5; see also Trapani et al. (1989) J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 14:419-424, Intengan et al. (1999) Hypertension 34(4):907-913, and Badyal et al. (2003) supra). Both the SHR and DOCA-salt models are useful for evaluating the ability of a test compound to reduce blood pressure. The DOCA-salt model is also useful to measure a test compound's ability to prevent or delay a rise in blood pressure. Compounds of the invention are expected to antagonize the AT1 receptor and/or inhibit the NEP enzyme in any of the assays listed above, or assays of a similar nature. Thus, the aforementioned assays are useful in determining the therapeutic utility of compounds of the invention, for example, their utility as antihypertensive agents. Other properties and utilities of compounds of the invention can be demonstrated using other in vitro and in vivo assays well-known to those skilled in the art. Compounds of the invention are expected to be useful for the treatment and/or prevention of medical conditions responsive to AT1 receptor antagonism and/or NEP inhibition. Thus it is expected that patients suffering from a disease or disorder that is treated by antagonizing the AT1 receptor and/or by inhibiting the NEP enzyme can be treated by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. For example, by antagonizing the AT1 receptor and thus interfering with the action of angiotensin II on its receptors, these compounds are expected to find utility in preventing the increase in blood pressure produced by angiotensin II, a potent vasopressor. In addition, by inhibiting NEP, the compounds are also expected to potentiate the biological effects of endogenous peptides that are metabolized by NEP, such as the natriuretic peptides, bombesin, bradykinins, calcitonin, endothelins, enkephalins, neurotensin, substance P and vasoactive intestinal peptide. For example, by potentiating the effects of the natriuretic peptides, compounds of the invention are expected to be useful to treat glaucoma. These compounds are also expected to have other physiological actions, for example, on the renal, central nervous, reproductive and gastrointestinal systems. Compounds of the invention are expected to find utility in treating and/or preventing medical conditions such as cardiovascular and renal diseases. Cardiovascular diseases of particular interest include heart failure such as congestive heart failure, acute heart failure, chronic heart failure, and acute and chronic decompensated heart failure. Renal diseases of particular interest include diabetic nephropathy and chronic kidney disease. One embodiment of the invention is directed to a method for treating hypertension, comprising administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Typically, the therapeutically effective amount is the amount that is sufficient to lower the patient's blood pressure. In one embodiment, the compound is administered as an oral dosage form. Another embodiment of the invention is directed to a method for treating heart failure, comprising administering to a patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Typically, the therapeutically effective amount is the amount that is sufficient to lower blood pressure and/or improve renal functions. In one embodiment, the compound is administered as an intravenous dosage form. When used to treat heart failure, the compound may be administered in combination with other therapeutic agents such as diuretics, natriuretic peptides, and adenosine receptor antagonists. Compounds of the invention are also expected to be useful in preventative therapy, for example in preventing the progression of cardiac insufficiency after myocardial infarction, preventing arterial restenosis after angioplasty, preventing thickening of blood vessel walls after vascular operations, preventing atherosclerosis, and preventing diabetic angiopathy. In addition, as NEP inhibitors, compounds of the invention are expected to inhibit enkephalinase, which will inhibit the degradation of endogenous enkephalins and thus such compounds may also find utility as analgesics. Due to their NEP inhibition properties, compounds of the invention are also expected to be useful as antitussive agents and antidiarrheal agents (for example, for the treatment of watery diarrhea), as well as find utility in the treatment of menstrual disorders, preterm labor, pre-eclampsia, endometriosis, reproductive disorders (for example, male and female infertility, polycystic ovarian syndrome, implantation failure), and male and female sexual dysfunction, including male erectile dysfunction and female sexual arousal disorder. More specifically, the compounds of the invention are expected to be useful in treating female sexual dysfunction, which is often defined as a female patient's difficulty or inability to find satisfaction in sexual expression. This covers a variety of diverse female sexual disorders including, by way of illustration and not limitation, hypoactive sexual desire disorder, sexual arousal disorder, orgasmic disorder and sexual pain disorder. When used to treat such disorders, especially female sexual dysfunction, compounds of the invention may be combined with one or more of the following secondary agents: PDE5 inhibitors, dopamine agonists, estrogen receptor agonists and/or antagonists, androgens, and estrogens. The amount of the compound of the invention administered per dose or the total amount administered per day may be predetermined or it may be determined on an individual patient basis by taking into consideration numerous factors, including the nature and severity of the patient's condition, the condition being treated, the age, weight, and general health of the patient, the tolerance of the patient to the active agent, the route of administration, pharmacological considerations such as the activity, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and toxicology profiles of the compound and any secondary agents being administered, and the like. Treatment of a patient suffering from a disease or medical condition (such as hypertension) can begin with a predetermined dosage or a dosage determined by the treating physician, and will continue for a period of time necessary to prevent, ameliorate, suppress, or alleviate the symptoms of the disease or medical condition. Patients undergoing such treatment will typically be monitored on a routine basis to determine the effectiveness of therapy. For example, in treating hypertension, blood pressure measurements may be used to determine the effectiveness of treatment. Similar indicators for other diseases and conditions described herein, are well known and are readily available to the treating physician. Continuous monitoring by the physician will insure that the optimal amount of the compound of the invention will be administered at any given time, as well as facilitating the determination of the duration of treatment. This is of particular value when secondary agents are also being administered, as their selection, dosage, and duration of therapy may also require adjustment. In this way, the treatment regimen and dosing schedule can be adjusted over the course of therapy so that the lowest amount of active agent that exhibits the desired effectiveness is administered and, further, that administration is continued only so long as is necessary to successfully treat the disease or medical condition. Since compounds of the invention possess AT1 receptor antagonist activity and/or NEP enzyme inhibition activity, such compounds are also useful as research tools for investigating or studying biological systems or samples having AT1 receptors or a NEP enzyme, for example to study diseases where the AT1 receptor or NEP enzyme plays a role. Any suitable biological system or sample having AT1 receptors and/or a NEP enzyme may be employed in such studies which may be conducted either in vitro or in vivo. Representative biological systems or samples suitable for such studies include, but are not limited to, cells, cellular extracts, plasma membranes, tissue samples, isolated organs, mammals (such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, pigs, humans, and so forth), and the like, with mammals being of particular interest. In one particular embodiment of the invention an AT1 receptor in a mammal is antagonized by administering an AT1-antagonizing amount of a compound of the invention. In another particular embodiment, NEP enzyme activity in a mammal is inhibited by administering a NEP-inhibiting amount of a compound of the invention. Compounds of the invention can also be used as research tools by conducting biological assays using such compounds. When used as a research tool, a biological system or sample comprising an AT1 receptor and/or a NEP enzyme is typically contacted with an AT1 receptor-antagonizing or NEP enzyme-inhibiting amount of a compound of the invention. After the biological system or sample is exposed to the compound, the effects of antagonizing the AT1 receptor and/or inhibiting the NEP enzyme are determined using conventional procedures and equipment, such as by measuring receptor binding in a binding assay or measuring ligand-mediated changes in a functional assay. Exposure encompasses contacting cells or tissue with the compound, administering the compound to a mammal, for example by i.p., i.v. or s.c. administration, and so forth. This determining step can involve measuring a response (a quantitative analysis) or can involve making an observation (a qualitative analysis). Measuring a response involves, for example, determining the effects of the compound on the biological system or sample using conventional procedures and equipment, such as radioligand binding assays and measuring ligand-mediated changes in functional assays. The assay results can be used to determine the activity level as well as the amount of compound necessary to achieve the desired result, that is, an AT1 receptor-antagonizing and/or a NEP enzyme-inhibiting amount. Typically, the determining step will involve determining the AT1 receptor ligand-mediated effects and/or determining the effects of inhibiting the NEP enzyme. Additionally, compounds of the invention can be used as research tools for evaluating other chemical compounds, and thus are also useful in screening assays to discover, for example, new compounds having AT1 receptor-antagonizing activity and/or NEP-inhibiting activity. In this manner, a compound of the invention is used as a standard in an assay to allow comparison of the results obtained with a test compound and with compounds of the invention to identify those test compounds that have about equal or superior activity, if any. For example, Ki data (as determined, for example, by a binding assay) for a test compound or a group of test compounds is compared to the Ki data for a compound of the invention to identify those test compounds that have the desired properties, for example, test compounds having a Ki value about equal or superior to a compound of the invention, if any. This aspect of the invention includes, as separate embodiments, both the generation of comparison data (using the appropriate assays) and the analysis of test data to identify test compounds of interest. Thus, a test compound can be evaluated in a biological assay, by a method comprising the steps of: (a) conducting a biological assay with a test compound to provide a first assay value; (b) conducting the biological assay with a compound of the invention to provide a second assay value; wherein step (a) is conducted either before, after or concurrently with step (b); and (c) comparing the first assay value from step (a) with the second assay value from step (b). Exemplary biological assays include an AT1 receptor binding assay and a NEP enzyme inhibition assay. Pharmaceutical Compositions and Formulations Compounds of the invention are typically administered to a patient in the form of a pharmaceutical composition or formulation. Such pharmaceutical compositions may be administered to the patient by any acceptable route of administration including, but not limited to, oral, rectal, vaginal, nasal, inhaled, topical (including transdermal), ocular, and parenteral modes of administration. Further, the compounds of the invention may be administered, for example orally, in multiple doses per day (for example, two, three, or four times daily), in a single daily dose or a single weekly dose. It will be understood that any form of the compounds of the invention, (that is, free base, free acid, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, etc.) that is suitable for the particular mode of administration can be used in the pharmaceutical compositions discussed herein. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound of the invention. The compositions may contain other therapeutic and/or formulating agents if desired. When discussing compositions, the “compound of the invention” may also be referred to herein as the “active agent,” to distinguish it from other components of the formulation, such as the carrier. Thus, it is understood that the term “active agent” includes compounds of formula I as well as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs of that compound. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention typically contain a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Those skilled in the art will recognize, however, that a pharmaceutical composition may contain more than a therapeutically effective amount, such as in bulk compositions, or less than a therapeutically effective amount, that is, individual unit doses designed for multiple administration to achieve a therapeutically effective amount. Typically, the composition will contain from about 0.01-95 wt % of active agent, including, from about 0.01-30 wt %, such as from about 0.01-10 wt %, with the actual amount depending upon the formulation itself, the route of administration, the frequency of dosing, and so forth. In one embodiment, a composition suitable for an oral dosage form, for example, may contain about 5-70 wt %, or from about 10-60 wt % of active agent. Any conventional carrier or excipient may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. The choice of a particular carrier or excipient, or combinations of carriers or excipients, will depend on the mode of administration being used to treat a particular patient or type of medical condition or disease state. In this regard, the preparation of a suitable composition for a particular mode of administration is well within the scope of those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts. Additionally, carriers or excipients used in such compositions are commercially available. By way of further illustration, conventional formulation techniques are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition, Lippincott Williams & White, Baltimore, Md. (2000); and H. C. Ansel et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 7th Edition, Lippincott Williams & White, Baltimore, Md. (1999). Representative examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, the following: sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose, such as microcrystalline cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols, such as propylene glycol; polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol; phosphate buffer solutions; compressed propellant gases, such as chlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons; and other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical compositions. Pharmaceutical compositions are typically prepared by thoroughly and intimately mixing or blending the active agent with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and one or more optional ingredients. The resulting uniformly blended mixture may then be shaped or loaded into tablets, capsules, pills, canisters, cartridges, dispensers and the like using conventional procedures and equipment. In formulations where the compound of the invention contains a thiol group, additional consideration may be given to minimize or eliminate oxidation of the thiol to form a disulfide. In solid formulations, this may be accomplished by reducing the drying time, decreasing the moisture content of the formulation, and including materials such as ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, sodium sulfite and sodium bisulfite, as well as materials such as a mixture of lactose and microcrystalline cellulose. In liquid formulations, stability of the thiol may be improved by the addition of amino acids, antioxidants, or a combination of disodium edetate and ascorbic acid. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are suitable for oral administration. Suitable compositions for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, tablets, pills, lozenges, cachets, dragees, powders, granules; solutions or suspensions in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsions; elixirs or syrups; and the like; each containing a predetermined amount of the active agent. When intended for oral administration in a solid dosage form (capsules, tablets, pills and the like), the composition will typically comprise the active agent and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate. Solid dosage forms may also comprise: fillers or extenders, such as starches, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; binders, such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia; humectants, such as glycerol; disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and/or sodium carbonate; solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; wetting agents, such as cetyl alcohol and/or glycerol monostearate; absorbents, such as kaolin and/or bentonite clay; lubricants, such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and/or mixtures thereof; coloring agents; and buffering agents. Release agents, wetting agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants may also be present in the pharmaceutical compositions. Exemplary coating agents for tablets, capsules, pills and like, include those used for enteric coatings, such as cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinyl acetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, methacrylic acid-methacrylic acid ester copolymers, cellulose acetate trimellitate, carboxymethyl ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate, and the like. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable antioxidants include: water-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbic acid, cysteine hydrochloride, sodium bisulfate, sodium metabisulfate sodium sulfite and the like; oil-soluble antioxidants, such as ascorbyl palmitate, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, lecithin, propyl gallate, alpha-tocopherol, and the like; and metal-chelating agents, such as citric acid, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, sorbitol, tartaric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Compositions may also be formulated to provide slow or controlled release of the active agent using, by way of example, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose in varying proportions or other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. In addition, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may contain opacifying agents and may be formulated so that they release the active agent only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active agent can also be in micro-encapsulated form, optionally with one or more of the above-described excipients. Suitable liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, by way of illustration, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. Liquid dosage forms typically comprise the active agent and an inert diluent, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (for example, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Suspensions may contain suspending agents such as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminium metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof. When intended for oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be packaged in a unit dosage form. The term “unit dosage form” refers to a physically discrete unit suitable for dosing a patient, that is, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of the active agent calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect either alone or in combination with one or more additional units. For example, such unit dosage forms may be capsules, tablets, pills, and the like. In another embodiment, the compositions of the invention are suitable for inhaled administration, and will typically be in the form of an aerosol or a powder. Such compositions are generally administered using well-known delivery devices, such as a nebulizer, dry powder, or metered-dose inhaler. Nebulizer devices produce a stream of high velocity air that causes the composition to spray as a mist that is carried into a patient's respiratory tract. An exemplary nebulizer formulation comprises the active agent dissolved in a carrier to form a solution, or micronized and combined with a carrier to form a suspension of micronized particles of respirable size. Dry powder inhalers administer the active agent as a free-flowing powder that is dispersed in a patient's air-stream during inspiration. An exemplary dry powder formulation comprises the active agent dry-blended with an excipient such as lactose, starch, mannitol, dextrose, polylactic acid, polylactide-co-glycolide, and combinations thereof. Metered-dose inhalers discharge a measured amount of the active agent using compressed propellant gas. An exemplary metered-dose formulation comprises a solution or suspension of the active agent in a liquefied propellant, such as a chlorofluorocarbon or hydrofluoroalkane. Optional components of such formulations include co-solvents, such as ethanol or pentane, and surfactants, such as sorbitan trioleate, oleic acid, lecithin, glycerin, and sodium lauryl sulfate. Such compositions are typically prepared by adding chilled or pressurized hydrofluoroalkane to a suitable container containing the active agent, ethanol (if present) and the surfactant (if present). To prepare a suspension, the active agent is micronized and then combined with the propellant. Alternatively, a suspension formulation can be prepared by spray drying a coating of surfactant on micronized particles of the active agent. The formulation is then loaded into an aerosol canister, which forms a portion of the inhaler. Compounds of the invention can also be administered parenterally (for example, by subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intraperitoneal injection). For such administration, the active agent is provided in a sterile solution, suspension, or emulsion. Exemplary solvents for preparing such formulations include water, saline, low molecular weight alcohols such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, oils, gelatin, fatty acid esters such as ethyl oleate, and the like. Parenteral formulations may also contain one or more anti-oxidants, solubilizers, stabilizers, preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifiers, and dispersing agents. Surfactants, additional stabilizing agents or pH-adjusting agents (acids, bases or buffers) and anti-oxidants are particularly useful to provide stability to the formulation, for example, to minimize or avoid hydrolysis of ester and amide linkages, or dimerization of thiols that may be present in the compound. These formulations may be rendered sterile by use of a sterile injectable medium, a sterilizing agent, filtration, irradiation, or heat. In one particular embodiment, the parenteral formulation comprises an aqueous cyclodextrin solution as the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Suitable cyclodextrins include cyclic molecules containing six or more α-D-glucopyranose units linked at the 1,4 positions by a linkages as in amylase, β-cyclodextrin or cycloheptaamylose. Exemplary cyclodextrins include cyclodextrin derivatives such as hydroxypropyl and sulfobutyl ether cyclodextrins such as hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin and sulfobutyl ether β-cyclodextrin. Exemplary buffers for such formulations include carboxylic acid-based buffers such as citrate, lactate and maleate buffer solutions. Compounds of the invention can also be administered transdermally using known transdermal delivery systems and excipients. For example, the compound can be admixed with permeation enhancers, such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol monolaurate, azacycloalkan-2-ones and the like, and incorporated into a patch or similar delivery system. Additional excipients including gelling agents, emulsifiers and buffers, may be used in such transdermal compositions if desired. If desired, the compounds of the invention may be administered in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents. Thus, in one embodiment, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention contain other drugs that are co-administered with a compound of the invention. For example, the composition may further comprise one or more drugs (also referred to as “secondary agents(s)”) selected from the group of diuretics, β1 adrenergic receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, AT1 receptor antagonists, neprilysin inhibitors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, prostaglandins, anti-lipid agents, anti-diabetic agents, anti-thrombotic agents, renin inhibitors, endothelin receptor antagonists, endothelin converting enzyme inhibitors, aldosterone antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme/neprilysin inhibitors, and combinations thereof. Such therapeutic agents are well known in the art, and examples are described below. By combining a compound of the invention with a secondary agent, triple therapy can be achieved; AT1 receptor antagonist activity, NEP inhibition activity, and activity associated with the secondary agent (for example, β1 adrenergic receptor blocker) can be achieved using only two active components. Since compositions containing two active components are typically easier to formulate than compositions containing three active components, such two-component compositions provide a significant advantage over compositions containing three active components. Accordingly, in yet another aspect of the invention, a pharmaceutical composition comprises a compound of the invention, a second active agent, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Third, fourth etc. active agents may also be included in the composition. In combination therapy, the amount of compound of the invention that is administered, as well as the amount of secondary agents, may be less than the amount typically administered in monotherapy. Compounds of the invention may be physically mixed with the second active agent to form a composition containing both agents; or each agent may be present in separate and distinct compositions which are administered to the patient simultaneously or at separate times. For example, a compound of the invention can be combined with a second active agent using conventional procedures and equipment to form a combination of active agents comprising a compound of the invention and a second active agent. Additionally, the active agents may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention, a second active agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In this embodiment, the components of the composition are typically mixed or blended to create a physical mixture. The physical mixture is then administered in a therapeutically effective amount using any of the routes described herein. Alternatively, the active agents may remain separate and distinct before administration to the patient. In this embodiment, the agents are not physically mixed together before administration but are administered simultaneously or at separate times as separate compositions. Such compositions can be packaged separately or may be packaged together in a kit. When administered at separate times, the secondary agent will typically be administered less than 24 hours after administration of the compound of the invention, ranging anywhere from concurrent with administration of the compound of the invention to about 24 hours post-dose. This is also referred to as sequential administration. Thus, a compound of the invention can be orally administered simultaneously or sequentially with another active agent using two tablets, with one tablet for each active agent, where sequential may mean being administered immediately after administration of the compound of the invention or at some predetermined time later (for example, one hour later or three hours later). Alternatively, the combination may be administered by different routes of administration, that is, one orally and the other by inhalation. In one embodiment, the kit comprises a first dosage form comprising a compound of the invention and at least one additional dosage form comprising one or more of the secondary agents set forth herein, in quantities sufficient to carry out the methods of the invention. The first dosage form and the second (or third, etc,) dosage form together comprise a therapeutically effective amount of active agents for the treatment or prevention of a disease or medical condition in a patient. Secondary agent(s), when included, are present in a therapeutically effective amount such that they are typically administered in an amount that produces a therapeutically beneficial effect when co-administered with a compound of the invention. The secondary agent can be in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, optically pure stereoisomer, and so forth. The secondary agent may also be in the form of a prodrug, for example, a compound having a carboxylic acid group that has been esterified. Thus, secondary agents listed below are intended to include all such forms, and are commercially available or can be prepared using conventional procedures and reagents.

To this was added DIPEA (62 mL, 360 mmol, 1.1 eq) followed by the slow addition of [3-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy]methyl chloride (60.2 mL, 340 mmol, 1.05 eq). The solution was slowly warmed to room temperature. After 2 hours the mixture was washed 2× with 600 mL of 1M H3PO4/saturated aqueous NaCl ( 1/10 mL). The organic layer was dried over MgSO4, and evaporated to dryness, yielding intermediate (13b) as faint yellow liquid that solidified on standing (137 g). Intermediate (13b) (130 g, 290 mmol, 1.0 eq) was dissolved into 650 mL anhydrous ethanol. To this was slowly added potassium tert-butoxide (98.6 g, 879 mmol, 3.0 eq) and the mixture was heated to reflux for 16 hours. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature, filtered and concentrated. The resulting oil was dissolved into 800 mL EtOAc and washed with 400 mL saturated NaHCO3. The layers were separated and the organic was washed with saturated aqueous NaCl, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated, yielding intermediate (13c) as a brown oil (115.3 g). MS m/z: [M+H+] calcd for C11H20Br2N2O2Si, 401.9 found 401.2. Intermediate (13c) (69.5 g, 174 mmol, 1.0 eq) was dissolved in 600 mL of anhydrous THF and cooled to −78° C. under nitrogen. A 2.5 M solution of n-butyllithium in hexanes (72.9 mL, 180 mmol, 1.05 eq) was added dropwise and the mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 10 minutes. DMF (40 mL, 520 mmol, 3.0 eq) was then added and the mixture was stirred at −78° C. for 15 minutes and was then warmed to room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 10 mL water, diluted with 600 mL EtOAc and was washed with 100 mL water, saturated aqueous NaCl, dried over MgSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure. The recovered material was purified by silica gel chromatography (15-30% EtOAc:hexanes) to produce intermediate (13d) as a pale yellow oil (45 g). Intermediate (13d) (105.8 g, 303 mmol, 1.0 eq) was cooled at 0° C. in ice. TFA (300 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 15 minutes, then warmed to room temperature. After 90 minutes the mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and redissolved in 700 mL EtOAc. The organic was washed 2×600 mL saturated bicarbonate, saturated aqueous NaCl, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure to produce a yellow solid.

For membrane preparation, cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5 at 4° C., 1 mM EDTA, and one tablet of Complete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablets with 2 mM EDTA per 50 mL buffer (Roche cat. #1697498, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, Ind.)) and homogenized using a tight-fitting Dounce glass homogenizer (10 strokes) on ice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1000×g, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 20,000×g. The final pellet was resuspended in membrane buffer (75 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 0.3 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 250 mM sucrose at 4° C.) and homogenized by extrusion through a 20 G gauge needle. Protein concentration of the membrane suspension was determined by the method described in Bradford (1976) Anal Biochem. 72:248-54. Membranes were snap frozen in MeOH-dry ice and stored at −80° C. until further use. Ligand Binding Assay to Determine Compound Affinities for the Human AT1 and AT2 Angiotensin Receptors Binding assays were performed in 96-well Acrowell filter plates (Pall Inc., cat. #5020) in a total assay volume of 100 μL with 0.2 μg membrane protein for membranes containing the human AT1 receptor, or 2 μg membrane protein for membranes containing the human AT2 receptor in assay buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5 at 20° C., 5 mM MgCl2, 25 μM EDTA, 0.025% BSA). Saturation binding studies for determination of Kd values of the ligand were done using N-terminally Europium-labeled angiotensin-II ([Eu]AngII, H-(Eu—N1)-Ahx-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-OH; PerkinElmer, Boston, Mass.) at 8 different concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 30 nM. Displacement assays for determination of pKi values of test compounds were done with [Eu]AngII at 2 nM and 11 different concentrations of drug ranging from 1 μM to 10 μM. Drugs were dissolved to a concentration of 1 mM in DMSO and from there serially diluted into assay buffer. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μM unlabeled angiotensin-II. Assays were incubated for 120 minutes in the dark, at room temperature or 37° C., and binding reactions were terminated by rapid filtration through the Acrowell filter plates followed by three washes with 200 μL ice cold wash buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5 at 4° C., 5 mM MgCl2) using a Waters filtration manifold. Plates were tapped dry and incubated with 50 μl DELFIA Enhancement Solution (PerkinElmer cat. #4001-0010) at room temperature for 5 minutes on a shaker. Filter-bound [Eu]AngII was quantitated immediately on a Fusion plate reader (PerkinElmer) using Time Resolved Fluorescence (TRF). Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) using the 3-parameter model for one-site competition. The BOTTOM (curve minimum) was fixed to the value for nonspecific binding, as determined in the presence of 10 μM angiotensin II. Ki values for drugs were calculated from observed IC50 values and the Kd value of [Eu]AngII according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation described in Cheng et al. (1973) Biochem Pharmacol. 22(23):3099-108. Selectivities of test compounds for the AT1 receptor over the AT2 receptor were calculated as the ratio of AT2Ki/AT1Ki. Binding affinities of test compounds were expressed as negative decadic logarithms of the Ki values (pKi). In this assay, a higher pKi value indicates that the test compound has a higher binding affinity for the receptor tested. Exemplary compounds of the invention that were tested in this assay, typically were found to have a pKi at the AT1 receptor greater than or equal to about 5.0. For example, the compound of Example 1 was found to have a pKi value greater than about 7.0. Assay 2 In Vitro Assays for the Quantitation of Inhibitor Potencies (IC5) at Human and Rat NEP, and Human ACE The inhibitory activities of compounds at human and rat NEP and human ACE were determined using in vitro assays as described below. Extraction of NEP Activity from Rat Kidneys Rat NEP was prepared from the kidneys of adult Sprague Dawley rats. Whole kidneys were washed in cold PBS and brought up in ice-cold lysis buffer (1% Triton X-114, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5; Bordier (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256:1604-1607) in a ratio of 5 mL of buffer for every gram of kidney. Samples were homogenized using a polytron hand held tissue grinder on ice. Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000×g in a swinging bucket rotor for 5 minutes at 3° C. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mL of ice cold lysis buffer and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. Samples (15-20 mL) were then layered onto 25 mL of ice-cold cushion buffer (6% w/v sucrose, 50 mM pH 7.5 Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.06%, Triton X-114), heated to 37° C. for 3-5 minutes and centrifuged at 1000×g in a swinging bucket rotor at room temperature for 3 minutes. The two upper layers were aspirated off, leaving a viscous oily precipitate containing the enriched membrane fraction. Glycerol was added to a concentration of 50% and samples were stored at −20° C. Protein concentrations were quantitated using a BCA detection system with BSA as a standard. Enzyme Inhibition Assays Recombinant human NEP and recombinant human ACE were obtained commercially (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn., catalog numbers 1182-ZN and 929-ZN, respectively). The fluorogenic peptide substrate Mca-BK2 (Mca-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Ala-Phe-Lys(Dnp)-OH; Johnson et al. (2000) Anal. Biochem. 286: 112-118) was used for the human NEP and ACE assays, and Mca-RRL (Mca-DArg-Arg-Leu-(Dnp)-OH; Medeiros et al. (1997) Braz. J. Med. Biol. Res. 30:1157-1162) was used for the rat NEP assay (both from Anaspec, San Jose, Calif.). The assays were performed in 384-well white opaque plates at room temperature using the respective fluorogenic peptides at a concentration of 10 μM in assay buffer (50 mM Tris/HCL at 25° C., 100 mM NaCl, 0.01% Tween-20, 1 μM Zn, 0.025% BSA). Human NEP and human ACE were used at concentrations that resulted in quantitative proteolysis of 5 μM of Mca-BK2 within 20 minutes at room temperature. The rat NEP enzyme preparation was used at a concentration that yielded quantitative proteolysis of 3 μM of Mca-RRL within 20 minutes at room temperature. Assays were started by adding 25 μL of enzyme to 12.5 μL of test compound at 12 concentrations (10 μM to 20 μM). Inhibitors were allowed to equilibrate with the enzyme for 10 minutes before 12.5 μL of the fluorogenic substrates were added to initiate the reaction. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 10 μL of 3.6% glacial acetic acid after 20 minutes of incubation. Plates were read on a fluorometer with excitation and emission wavelengths set to 320 nm and 405 nm, respectively. Raw data (relative fluorescence units) were normalized to % activity from the average high readings (no inhibition, 100% enzyme activity) and average low readings (full inhibition, highest inhibitor concentration, 0% enzyme activity) using three standard NEP and ACE inhibitors, respectively. Nonlinear regression of the normalized data was performed using a one site competition model (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.). Data were reported as pIC50 values. Exemplary compounds of the invention that were tested in this assay, typically were found to have a pIC50 for the NEP enzyme greater than or equal to about 5.0. For example, the compound of Example 1 has a pIC50 value greater than or equal to about 7.0. Assay 3 Pharmacodynamic (PD) Assay for ACE, AT1, and NEP Activity in Anesthetized Rats Male, Sprague Dawley, normotensive rats are anesthetized with 120 mg/kg (i.p.) of inactin. Once anesthetized, the jugular vein, carotid artery (PE 50 tubing) and bladder (URI-1 urinary silicone catheter) are cannulated and a tracheotomy is performed (Teflon Needle, size 14 gauge) to facilitate spontaneous respiration. The animals are then allowed a 60 minute stabilization period and kept continuously infused with 5 mL/kg/h of saline (0.9%) throughout, to keep them hydrated and ensure urine production. Body temperature is maintained throughout the experiment by use of a heating pad. At the end of the 60 minute stabilization period, the animals are dosed intravenously (i.v.) with two doses of angiotensin (AngI, 1.0 μg/kg, for ACE inhibitor activity; AngII, 0.1 μg/kg, for AT1 receptor antagonist activity) at 15 minutes apart. At 15 minutes post-second dose of angiotensin (AngI or AngII), the animals are treated with vehicle or test compound. Five minutes later, the animals are additionally treated with a bolus i.v. injection of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP; 30 g/kg). Urine collection (into pre-weighted eppendorf tubes) is started immediately after the ANP treatment and continued for 60 minutes. At 30 and 60 minutes into urine collection, the animals are re-challenged with angiotensin (AngI or AngII). Blood pressure measurements are done using the Notocord system (Kalamazoo, Mich.). Urine samples are frozen at −20° C. until used for the cGMP assay. Urine cGMP concentrations are determined by Enzyme Immuno Assay using a commercial kit (Assay Designs, Ann Arbor, Mich., Cat. No. 901-013). Urine volume is determined gravimetrically. Urinary cGMP output is calculated as the product of urine output and urine cGMP concentration. ACE inhibition or AT1 antagonism is assessed by quantifying the % inhibition of pressor response to AngI or AngII, respectively. NEP inhibition is assessed by quantifying the potentiation of ANP-induced elevation in urinary cGMP output. Assay 4 In Vivo Evaluation of Antihypertensive Effects in the Conscious SHR Model of Hypertension Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR, 14-20 weeks of age) are allowed a minimum of 48 hours acclimation upon arrival at the testing site. Seven days prior to testing, the animals are either placed on a restricted low-salt diet with food containing 0.1% of sodium for sodium depleted SHRs (SD-SHR) or are placed on a normal diet for sodium repleted SHRs (SR-SHR). Two days prior to testing, the animals are surgically implemented with catheters into a carotid artery and the jugular vein (PE50 polyethylene tubing) connected via a PE10 polyethylene tubing to a selected silicone tubing (size 0.020 ID×0.037 OD×0.008 wall) for blood pressure measurement and test compound delivery, respectively. The animals are allowed to recover with appropriate post operative care. On the day of the experiment, the animals are placed in their cages and the catheters are connected via a swivel to a calibrated pressure transducer. After 1 hour of acclimation, a baseline measurement is taken over a period of at least five minutes. The animals are then dosed i.v. with vehicle or test compound in ascending cumulative doses every 60 minutes followed by a 0.3 mL saline to clear the catheter after each dose. Data is recorded continuously for the duration of the study using Notocord software (Kalamazoo, Mich.) and stored as electronic digital signals. In some studies, the effects of a single intravenous or oral (gavage) dose are monitored for at least 6 hours after dosing. Parameters measured are blood pressure (systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure) and heart rate. Assay 5 In Vivo Evaluation of Antihypertensive Effects in the Conscious DOCA-Salt Rat Model of Hypertension CD rats (male, adult, 200-300 grams, Charles River Laboratory, USA) are allowed a minimum of 48 hours acclimation upon arrival at the testing site before they are placed on a high salt diet. One week after the start of the high salt diet, a DOCA-salt pellet (100 mg, 21 days release time, Innovative Research of America, Sarasota, Fla.) is implanted subcutaneously and unilateral nephrectomy is performed. On 16 or 17 days post DOCA-salt pellet implantation, animals are implanted surgically with catheters into a carotid artery and the jugular vein with a PE50 polyethylene tubing, which in turn was connected via a PE10 polyethylene tubing to a selected silicone tubing (size 0.020 ID×0.037 OD×0.008 wall) for blood pressure measurement and test compound delivery, respectively. The animals are allowed to recover with appropriate post operative care. On the day of the experiment, each animal is kept in its cage and connected via a swivel to a calibrated pressure transducer. After 1 hour of acclimation, a baseline measurement is taken over a period of at least five minutes. The animals are then dosed i.v. with a vehicle or test compound in escalating cumulative doses every 60 minutes followed by 0.3 mL of saline to flush the catheter after each dose. In some studies, the effects of a single intravenous or oral (gavage) dose is tested and monitored for at least 6 hours after dosing. Data is recorded continuously for the duration of the study using Notocord software (Kalamazoo, Mich.) and stored as electronic digital signals. Parameters measured are blood pressure (systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure) and heart rate. For cumulative and single dosing, the percentage change in mean arterial pressure (MAP, mmHg) or heart rate (HR, bpm) is determined as described for Assay 4.
