TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a catalyst to be used for hydrogenation of organic compounds. Specifically, it relates to a useful catalyst to be used for hydrogenation of an aldehyde, a ketone, a carboxylic acid, a carboxylic acid ester, an aromatic nitro compound, etc. BACKGROUND ART As a useful catalyst to be used for such a hydrogenation reaction, a copper/chromium oxide catalyst has been widely known as a copper chromite catalyst (e.g. Non-Patent Document 1). As a specific example, a process for producing aniline has been known wherein a gaseous nitrobenzene is reduced with hydrogen by means of a copper/chromium oxide catalyst under such conditions that the reaction temperature is from 180 to 370° C., the pressure is from 0.1 to 0.5 MPa and a nitrobenzene concentration is from 2 to 14 vol % (e.g. Patent Document 1). However, such a catalyst containing chromium oxide is likely to cause environmental contamination or health hazard, and a due care is required in its handling, and further, substantial labor and costs have been required also for the treatment and recovery of the catalyst used. Further, a process for producing an aromatic amine by hydrogenation of an aromatic nitro compound by using a modified Raney copper which comprises copper, iron and aluminum as basic components, has been proposed (e.g. Patent Document 2). However, a Raney metal catalyst is usually susceptible to deterioration of the activity due to surface oxidation and is therefore required to be stored in water or in an inert gas atmosphere, and a due care is required for its handling. Further, while its activity is high, it has such a problem that the durability is inadequate. Recently, a molded hydrogenation catalyst has been proposed which is made of a natural clay mineral such as copper, calcium silicate, attapulgite, etc. (e.g. Patent Document 3). While such a molded catalyst is excellent in strength and durability, it contains natural material as raw material, and it has a drawback that reproducibility is poor with respect to the composition or particle size of the catalyst to be produced, due to variations in its composition or physical properties. Further, a molded catalyst comprising copper, calcium silicate, hydrotalcite, etc., has been proposed (e.g. Patent Document 4). However, such a molded catalyst employs hydrotalcite having the composition controlled, and petal-shaped calcium silicate, and therefore, it has an economical problem that the price is obliged to be relatively high.

Advantageous Effects of Invention The hydrogenation catalyst of the present invention does not contain hazardous chromium as a component and has an excellent activity, selectivity and long catalyst life for a hydrogenation reaction of an aldehyde, a ketone, a carboxylic acid, a carboxylic acid ester, an aromatic nitro compound, etc. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows the relation between the CaO/SiO2 molar ratio in calcium silicate and the estimated catalyst life. FIG. 2 shows the relation between the sodium content in the catalyst and the estimated catalyst life. DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS Now, the present invention will be described in detail. The present invention provides a hydrogenation catalyst which comprises, as the main components, (1) copper and (2) at least one member selected from the group consisting of silicon oxide, calcium oxide and calcium silicate, in a total amount of preferably at least 90 wt %, particularly preferably at least 95 wt %, wherein the content of the copper is from 20 to 60 wt % based on the entire amount of the hydrogenation catalyst, and in the calcium silicate, the molar ratio of calcium oxide (CaO) to silicon oxide (SiO2) is less than 1. Further, the present invention provides such a hydrogenation catalyst which further contains an alkali metal in an amount of from 0.22 to 2.5 wt %, based on the entire amount of the hydrogenation catalyst. The copper as a component of the hydrogenation catalyst is prepared by reducing a hydrogenation catalyst precursor containing copper oxide, a hydroxide, carbonate or nitrate which can readily be converted to copper oxide by firing, or a mixture of two or more of them. The hydrogenation catalyst of the present invention contains the copper in an amount of from 20 to 60 wt %, preferably from 30 to 60 wt %, more preferably from 30 to 55 wt %, based on the entire amount of the hydrogenation catalyst. If the content of the copper is less than 20 wt %, the activity tends to be deficient to the reaction load (the raw material-feeding amount), whereby coking tends to increase, and the catalyst life (useful life) tends to be short. On the other hand, if the content of the copper exceeds 60 wt %, the dispersibility at the time of supporting the copper tends to deteriorate, and the activity per the supported copper tends to be low. Further, the content of the copper is preferably within a range of from 30 to 60 wt %, more preferably from 30 to 55 wt %, whereby improvement of the catalyst life can be expected. The content of the copper in the hydrogenation catalyst was calculated as copper ions by a method in accordance with the ICP analytical method disclosed in JIS K0400-52-30. Among silicon oxide, calcium oxide and calcium silicate to be used in the present invention, calcium silicate is most preferred, and it may be either natural one or synthetic one. In the calcium silicate, the molar ratio of calcium oxide (CaO) to silicon oxide (SiO2) is preferably less than 1, more preferably within a range of from 0.1 to 0.7, most preferably within a range of from 0.2 to 0.4. When the molar ratio of CaO calculated as calcium oxide to SiO2 calculated as silicon oxide, in the calcium silicate, is less than 1, preferably within a range of from 0.1 to 0.7, the dispersibility of copper at the time of supporting the copper will be remarkably high, and the supported copper particles will be fine particles. As a result, the surface area of the copper increases to bring about an effect to increase the catalyst activity. Further, the acidity/basicity of the catalyst is thereby modified to bring about an effect to prevent so-called coking i.e. precipitation of carbon on the catalyst surface. Thus, it is considered that deterioration of the activity by coking is prevented, and the catalyst life is substantially prolonged. Further, when the molar ratio of calcium oxide (CaO) to silicon oxide (SiO2) in the calcium silicate is within a range of from 0.2 to 0.4, further improvement of the catalyst life is expected, such being desirable. In the present invention, silicon oxide (SiO2) in the calcium silicate was calculated by a method in accordance with the gravimetric method disclosed in JIS K0101, and calcium oxide (CaO) was calculated as calcium ions by a method in accordance with the ICP analytical method disclosed in JIS K0400-52-30 and converted to calcium oxide. The surface area of the calcium silicate to be used in the present invention is preferably at least 100 m2/g, more preferably at least 150 m2/g. When the surface area of the calcium silicate is at least 100 m2/g, copper will be supported, as highly dispersed, on the calcium silicate. Accordingly, copper particles will be fine particles, and as a result, the surface area of the copper becomes large to bring about an effect to increase the catalyst activity. It is considered that coking is thereby prevented, and the catalyst life is substantially prolonged. Further, when the surface area of the calcium silicate is at least 150 m2/g, further improvement of the catalyst life is expected, such being desirable. The surface area of the calcium silicate was calculated by a method in accordance with the gas adsorption method disclosed in JIS Z8830. The calcium silicate to be used in the present invention may be either the natural one or synthetic one, but it is preferred to employ one synthesized by controlling the molar ratio of calcium oxide (CaO) to silicon oxide (SiO2) to be from 0.1 to 0.7. More specifically, silicon oxide and a calcium source reactive therewith, such as quick lime (calcium oxide), slaked lime (calcium hydroxide), calcium chloride or calcium carbonate, are mixed under the atmospheric pressure at room temperature or under heating to obtain calcium silicate. At that time, an alkali such as sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate may be added to accelerate the reaction. The silicon oxide may be crystalline or non-crystalline or a mixture thereof, but non-crystalline one is preferred. Such non-crystalline silicon oxide may be one produced by either a dry synthetic method or a wet synthetic method. However, inexpensive one produced by a wet synthetic method is available as a commercial product, for example, Nipsil “NS-K” (registered trademark) manufactured by TOSOH SILICA CORPORATION. The hydrogenation catalyst of the present invention may contain an alkali metal in an amount of from 0.22 to 2.5 wt %, preferably from 0.25 to 1.7 wt %, based on the entire amount of the hydrogenation catalyst. The alkali metal may be present in the form of reduced metal, in the form of an oxide or in a form which can be converted to the oxide. By incorporating from 0.22 to 2.5 wt % of an alkali metal, particularly sodium, to the hydrogenation catalyst of the present invention in such a manner, the acidity/basicity of the catalyst is modified to obtain an effect to prevent so-called coking i.e. precipitation of carbon on the catalyst surface. It is considered that as a result, deterioration of the activity by coking is prevented, and the catalyst life is substantially prolonged. Further, when the content of the alkali metal is within a range of from 0.25 to 1.7 wt %, further improvement of the catalyst life is expected, such being desirable. Here, the content of the alkali metal in the hydrogenation catalyst is one measured and obtained as alkali metal ions by a method in accordance with the ICP analytical method disclosed in JIS K0400-52-30. At the time of producing the catalyst of the present invention, a means to mix calcium silicate and copper, or copper oxide or at least one copper compound which can readily be converted to copper oxide by firing such as a hydroxide, carbonate or nitrate, is not particularly limited, and any means may be employed so long as it is a means capable of uniformly mixing them. For example, such a composition is charged into a mixing apparatus and subjected to dry mixing or wet mixing, and the obtained mixture is dried and fired to obtain a precursor powder for the hydrogenation catalyst of the present invention. Otherwise, to an aqueous slurry of the above-mentioned calcium silicate wet-synthesized from silicon oxide and calcium oxide, an aqueous solution of e.g. copper nitrate or copper chloride is added continuously, dividedly or all at once, followed by neutralization with e.g. an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, an aqueous sodium carbonate solution or an aqueous sodium hydrogencarbonate solution to have copper supported on calcium silicate, followed by filtration to obtain a catalyst wet cake. The obtained wet cake is dried to obtain a precursor powder for the hydrogenation catalyst of the present invention. Using a flowability-adjusting agent, a pore-imparting agent, a reinforcing agent or a binder such as clay, as an adjuvant, as the case requires, the powdery catalyst is subjected to extrusion molding or compression molding to obtain a molded product of a various structure or shape, followed by firing to obtain a molded product of the hydrogenation catalyst precursor. In the present invention, the hydrogenation catalyst precursor is reduced and activated to form a hydrogenation catalyst, preferably in the reactor, before carrying out the intended hydrogenation reaction. As a method for reducing the hydrogenation catalyst precursor, for example, in a case where the reduction is carried out in a gas phase or liquid phase by using hydrogen gas as a reducing agent, it is preferred to carry out gas phase reduction at a temperature of from 100 to 500° C., preferably from 150 to 300° C. If the temperature is less than 100° C., the reduction reaction tends to hardly proceed, and if it exceeds 500° C., deterioration of the activity is likely to occur due to sintering of copper, such being undesirable. Further, within a temperature range of from 150 to 300° C., the reaction proceeds under a stabilized condition, such being preferred. In such a case, hydrogen gas diluted with an inert gas such as nitrogen, helium or argon may be used. The hydrogenation catalyst of the present invention thus obtained is useful for a hydrogenation reaction of an aldehyde, a ketone, a carboxylic acid, a carboxylic acid ester or an aromatic nitro compound. The aldehyde which can be hydrogenated by means of the catalyst of the present invention to produce an alcohol may, for example, be formaldehyde, propionaldehyde, n-butyraldehyde, isobutyraldehyde, valeraldehyde, 2-methylbutyraldehyde, 3-methylbutyraldehyde, 2,2-dimethylpropionaldehyde, capronaldehyde, 2-methylvaleraldehyde, 3-methylvaleraldehyde, 4-methylvaleraldehyde, 2-ethylbutyraldehyde, 2,2-dimethylbutyraldehyde, 3,3-dimethylbutyraldehyde, caprylaldehyde, capric aldehyde or glutardialdehyde. The ketone may, for example, be acetone, butanone, pentanone, hexanone, cyclohexanone or acetophenone. The carboxylic acid or carboxylic acid ester which can be hydrogenated by means of the catalyst of the present invention to produce an alcohol, may, for example, be formic acid, acetic acid, capronic acid, caprylic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, isostearic acid, oleic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, adipic acid, sebacic acid, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid, benzoic acid or phthalic acid, or an ester thereof. The aromatic nitro compound which can be hydrogenated by means of the catalyst of the present invention to produce an aromatic amine compound, may, for example, be nitrobenzene, an alkyl-substituted nitrobenzene, a nitronaphthalene, 4-nitrodiphenyl, nitroanthraquinone, a nitrophenanthro, 2-nitrofuran, 2-nitrothiophene, 3-nitropyridine, 2-nitrodiphenyl ether, 5-nitro-1H-benzotriazole, an isomeric dinitrobenzene, an isomeric nitroaniline, p-nitrobenzoic acid, m-nitrobenzoic acid, o-nitrobenzoic acid, an isomeric nitrophenol, o-nitrochlorobenzene, m-nitrochlorobenzene, p-nitrochlorobenzene or 3,4-dinitrochlorobenzene. Particularly, nitrobenzene is a nitro compound to which the hydrogenation reaction of the present invention may suitably be applied. The hydrogenation of nitrobenzene is carried out usually at a temperature within a range of from 100 to 350° C. under a pressure of from 0.1 to 0.5 MPa, whereby side reactions can be suppressed, and the catalyst life can be prolonged. The molar ratio of hydrogen/nitrobenzene is preferably from 10 to 20, and with a view to removing a reaction heat or preventing the catalyst deterioration, the reaction may be carried out by mixing an inert gas such as nitrogen. GHSV (gas hourly space velocity) is preferably within a range of 1,000 to 2,000 h−1. EXAMPLES Now, the present invention will be described in detail with reference to Examples, but it should be understood that the present invention is by no means limited by such Examples. Example 1 (Preparation of Molded Hydrogenation Catalyst Precursor) Into a 2 L glass container, 225 mL of ion exchanged water was added, and then, 30.0 g of silica powder (Nipsil “NS-K”, manufactured by TOSOH SILICA CORPORATION) and 7.0 g of quick lime powder (Reagent grade 1, manufactured by KANTO CHEMICAL CO., INC.) were charged so that the molar ratio (CaO/SiO2 molar ratio) of calcium oxide to silica (silicon oxide) would be 0.25, followed by stirring for 24 hours at 25° C. to prepare a calcium silicate carrier. While maintaining the aqueous calcium silicate slurry thus prepared, at 25° C. with stirring, 382.7 g of a 39 wt % copper nitrate aqueous solution (manufactured by KANSAI CATALYST CO., LTD.) was added at a constant speed over 3 hours. At that time, the aqueous slurry was adjusted to a pH of from 6.5 to 7.5 with a 20 wt % sodium carbonate aqueous solution. After completion of the addition of the copper nitrate aqueous solution, stirring and aging were carried out at 25° C. for 2 hours. Then, the precipitate was collected by filtration, and the wet cake was washed with 3 L of ion exchanged water. The obtained wet cake was dried in air overnight at 110° C., and the dried solid was roughly pulverized and fired at 450° C. for 3 hours. To the obtained fired powder, 2.0 g of graphite was added and mixed as a lubricant, followed by molding into a cylindrical shape of 5 mm in diameter×5 mm by a rotary tableting machine. The obtained molded product was again fired at 450° C. for 3 hours to obtain a molded hydrogenation catalyst precursor. (Hydrogenation Reaction of Nitrobenzene) The above molded hydrogenation catalyst precursor was pulverized by a mortar, and by means of sieves with mesh sizes of 2.8 mm and 1.0 mm, the catalyst was sieved to obtain particles of from 2.8 to 1.0 mm. 30 mL of the sieved catalyst particles were packed into a fixed bed reactor made of SUS and reduced (at 215° C. for 24 hours) in a hydrogen stream and activated. For evaluation of the catalytic performance, a hydrogenation reaction of nitrobenzene was continuously carried out for 800 hours under such conditions that the hydrogen pressure was 0.14 MPa, the reaction temperature was 175° C., GHSV was 1,500 h−1, LHSV (liquid hourly space velocity) was 0.4 h−1 and the hydrogen/nitrobenzene molar ratio was 15. The obtained reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography (apparatus: GC-14A manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation, column: DB170). The aniline selectivity after the reaction for 800 hours was 99.8%. Further, the estimated catalyst life calculated from the moving rate of the maximum temperature position in the catalyst layer during this reaction for 800 hours was about 17,000 hours. In Table 1, the copper content (wt %), the CaO/SiO2 molar ratio, the aniline selectivity (%) after the reaction for 800 hours and the estimated catalyst life (hours) are shown. Here, the content of the copper was quantitatively analyzed by ICP Optima 5300DV manufactured by PerkinElmer. Further, the carrier surface area was measured by FlowSorb II2300, manufactured by Shimadzu Corporation.

Ex. 6 38.6 0.64 99.8 7,900 Example 11 (Preparation of Molded Hydrogenation Catalyst Precursor) Into a 2 L glass container, 225 mL of ion exchanged water was added, and then, 30.0 g of silica powder (Nipsil “NS-K”, manufactured by TOSOH SILICA CORPORATION) and 7.0 g of quick lime powder (Reagent grade 1, manufactured by KANTO CHEMICAL CO., INC.) were charged so that the molar ratio (CaO/SiO2 molar ratio) of calcium oxide to silica (silicon oxide) would be 0.25, followed by stirring at 25° C. for 24 hours to prepare a calcium silicate carrier. To the aqueous calcium silicate slurry thus prepared, 382.7 g of a 39 wt % copper nitrate aqueous solution (manufactured by KANSAI CATALYST CO., LTD.) was added at a constant speed over 3 hours while maintaining the temperature at 25° C. with stirring. At that time, the aqueous slurry was adjusted to a pH of from 6.5 to 7.5 with a 20 wt % sodium carbonate aqueous solution. After completion of the addition of the copper nitrate aqueous solution, stirring and aging were carried out for 2 hours at 25° C. Then, the precipitate was collected by filtration, and the wet cake was washed with 5 L of ion exchange water. The obtained wet cake was dried in air at 110° C. overnight, and the dried solid was roughly pulverized and fired at 450° C. for 3 hours. To the obtained fired powder, 2.0 g of graphite was added and mixed as a lubricant, followed by molding into a cylindrical shape of 5 mm in diameter×5 mm by a rotary tableting machine. The obtained molded product was again fired at 450° C. for 3 hours to obtain a molded hydrogenation catalyst precursor. The sodium content in this molded catalyst precursor was 0.26 wt %. Here, the content of sodium was measured by ICP Optima 5300DV, manufactured by PerkinElmer. (Hydrogenation Reaction of Nitrobenzene) The above molded hydrogenation catalyst precursor was pulverized by a mortar, and using sieves with mesh sizes of 2.8 mm and 1.0 mm, the catalyst was sieved to obtain particles of from 2.8 to 1.0 mm. 30 mL of the sieved catalyst particles were packed into a fixed bed reactor made of SUS and reduced (at 215° C. for 24 hours) in a hydrogen stream and activated. For evaluation of the catalytic performance, a hydrogenation reaction of nitrobenzene was continuously carried out for 800 hours under such conditions that the hydrogen pressure was 0.14 MPa, the reaction temperature was 175° C., GHSV was 1,500 h−1, LHSV (liquid hourly space velocity) was 0.4 h−1 and the hydrogen/nitrobenzene molar ratio was 15. The obtained reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography. The aniline selectivity after the reaction for 800 hours was 99.6%. Further, the estimated catalyst life calculated from the moving rate of the maximum temperature position in the catalyst layer during this reaction for 800 hours, was about 13,000 hours. In Table 2, the copper content (wt %), the CaO/SiO2 molar ratio, the sodium content (wt %), the aniline selectivity (%) after the reaction for 800 hours and the estimated catalyst life (hours) are shown. The measurement of the content of copper was carried out in the same manner as in Example 1. Examples 12 to 17 The preparation of the molded hydrogenation catalyst precursor and the hydrogenation reaction of nitrobenzene were carried out in the same manner as in Example 11 except that the copper content (wt %) and the CaO/SiO2 molar ratio were changed to the prescribed levels shown in Table 2. That is, the aqueous slurry was filtered, and the wet catalyst was washed by changing the amount of washing water so that the contained sodium became the prescribed content. The obtained wet cake was subjected to the same operation as in Example 11 to prepare the hydrogenation catalyst. The results of the aniline selectivity after the reaction for 800 hours and the estimated catalyst life are shown in Table 2. Comparative Examples 7 to 8 The preparation of the molded hydrogenation catalyst precursor and the hydrogenation reaction of nitrobenzene were carried out in the same manner as in Example 11 except that the copper content (wt %) and the CaO/SiO2 molar ratio became the prescribed levels shown in Table 2. That is, the aqueous slurry was filtered, and the wet catalyst was washed by changing the amount of washing water so that the contained sodium became the prescribed content. The obtained wet cake was subjected to the same operation as in Example 11 to prepare the hydrogenation catalyst. The results of the aniline selectivity after the reaction for 800 hours and the estimated catalyst life are shown in Table 2.
