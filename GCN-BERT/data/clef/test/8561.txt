LATIN NAME OF THE GENUS AND SPECIES The Latin name of the novel plant variety disclosed herein is Pyrus calleryana×Pyrus pyrifolia. VARIETY DENOMINATION The inventive interspecific hybrid of Pyrus calleryana×Pyrus pyrifolia disclosed herein has been given the varietal denomination ‘NCPX1’. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention comprises a new and distinct hybrid flowering pear cultivar hereinafter referred to by the cultivar name ‘NCPX1’. This new flowering pear was developed through a breeding program at North Carolina State University, Mills River, N.C. ‘NCPX1’ was selected from an F1 population of seedlings grown from a controlled cross of Pyrus calleryana ‘Cleveland Select’×Pyrus pyrifolia ‘Ohara Beni’. The first asexual propagation of ‘NCPX1’ was carried out in August 2007 by budding at the North Carolina State University, Mountain Horticultural Crops Research Station, Mills River, N.C. and has been asexually reproduced repeatedly by budding over a 7 year period. ‘NCPX1’ propagates readily from budding using chip budding in mid-summer. ‘NCPX1’ has been found to retain its distinctive characteristics through successive asexual propagations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The following are the unique and distinguishing characteristics of this new cultivar when grown under standard horticultural practices at North Carolina State University, Mountain Horticultural Crops Research Station, Mills River, N.C. 1. Unique fastigiate form. 2. Red to purple flower buds that open with white petals. 3. Resistance to fire blight. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS This new flowering pear is illustrated by the accompanying photographs which show the plant's form, foliage and inflorescences.

FIG. 3 is a photograph showing the white petal color of flowers near anthesis in April 2013. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION The following is a detailed description of the botanical characteristics of the new and distinct variety of interspecific hybrid flowering pear known by the denomination ‘NCPX1’. The detailed description was taken on the original eight-year-old tree growing in Mills River, N.C. All colors cited herein refer to The Royal Horticultural Society Colour Chart (The Royal Horticultural Society (R.H.S.), London, 2001 Edition). Where specific dimensions, sizes, colors, and other characteristics are given, it is to be understood that such characteristics are approximations or averages set forth as accurately as practicable.

COMPARISON WITH PARENTAL TAXA Disease resistance to fire blight was evaluated following the procedures of Bell, A. C., T. G. Ranney, T. A. Eaker, and T. B. Sutton, 2004, Resistance to fire blight among flowering pears and quince, HortScience 40(2):413-415. Briefly, a virulent strain of Erwinia amylovora (E2002a) was prepared from 24 hour old cultures grown on nutrient agar. Three actively growing shoots were inoculated in May of 2011 and 2012 by bisecting the youngest leaves with a pair of scissors that had been dipped into the inoculum prior to each cut. The diseases lesion length and total length of the current season's growth of the inoculated shoot were measured 40 days following inoculation. The severity of infection was expressed as the length of the fire blight lesion as a percentage of overall shoot length. ‘NCPX1’ was found to have a high level of resistance to fire blight with 0% lesion lengths in both 2011 and 2012 following controlled inoculations (Table 1). No signs or symptoms of fire blight have been observed on ‘NCPX1’ as the result of natural infection over the last 8 years.
