Example 160A
6-Chloro-3-ethylpyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione
At a temperature of 0째 C., 28.8 ml (309 mmol) of phosphorus oxychloride were added cautiously to 6.6 ml of 50% aqueous ethanol. Then, likewise at 0째 C., 5.4 g (34.6 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 158A were added in portions. After the addition had ended, the reaction mixture was heated first for 30 min at 50째 C. and then for 2 h at 100째 C. After the mixture had cooled to RT, it was poured into about 100 ml of ice-water. The precipitated solid was filtered off with suction and washed with water. After drying under high vacuum, 2.78 g (46% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
