Physiological information describes the functions of the human body. One means to collect physiological information is through haptic collection, that is, monitoring responses to touch, such as applied forces, vibrations, or motions to a user. Alternatively, physiological information may be collected by directly monitoring or sensing electrical activity at the skin or electro-dermal activity. Active sensing includes Galvanic Skin Response(s), which comprises applying current directly to the skin to see resistance of the skin surface tissue. Passive sensing includes EMG, ECG, or EEG. Direct electrical stimulation of the skin promotes electro-dermal activity. To that end, collecting physiological information may comprise sending messaging through the skin and measuring the messaging. The messaging may occur through active monitoring, such as Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) or through passive monitoring through electromyography (EMG) and electrocardiography (ECG), the recording of the electrical activity of the heart, a diagnostic tool to assess the electrical and muscular functions of the heart (ECG or EKG). EMG and EKG both measure the electrical field created by a moving muscle. EKG is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart and measures signals from the heart muscle, yet spreads electrodes across the body. EMG places a pair of electrodes directly over a muscle to measure the muscle activity while minimizing signals from other muscles, including the heart. In one embodiment, at least one of the electrodes may be activated to stimulate a muscle in communication with the activated electrode. Similarly, with an array of electrodes, at least one of the electrodes in the array may be activated to stimulate a muscle in communication with the activated electrode. With EKG, activity is detected by electrodes attached to the surface of the skin. More than two electrodes are generally used, combined into pairs. The electrodes detect and amplify small electrical changes on the skin with each heartbeat, detected as small changes in the form of rises and falls in the voltage between two electrodes placed on either side of the heart. Electrodes may be used to sense electrical activity or communicate electrical activity by measuring the conductivity at the surface of the skin. It is understood that the human body is not static and is constantly subject to change. Under different circumstances, the skin may have different reactions. For example, in one embodiment, the body may have a reaction that causes moisture or dampness on the skin surface in one or more select locations. To accommodate or respond to this condition, detection of moisture adjacent or proximal to one of more of the electrodes in the array may cause an adjustment of measurement of an associated electro-dermal signal. In one embodiment, the moisture detected must be in excess of a threshold value. A switch is provided that supports at least three positions, including one non-connected position. One position is negative, and another position is positive, for receipt of a signal. Any one or more of the electrodes may have the functionality switched and/or paired with other electrodes in the array. Referring to FIG. 1, a block diagram (100) is provided illustrating an electro-dermal interface. As shown, two electrodes (110) and (120) are in communication with switching circuitry (130). Although only two electrodes (110) and (120) are shown, it is understood that additional electrodes may be employed, each in communication with the switching circuitry (130). Each electrode is configured to measure electro-dermal activity in the form of electro-dermal data. As shown, the electrode (110) is in communication with a first switch (132) embedded in the switching circuitry (130). Similarly, electrode (120) is in communication with a second switch (134) embedded in switching circuitry (130). As shown herein, both the first switch (132) and the second switch (134) are three pole switching devices. More specifically, the first switch (132) has three positions, including a first position (132a), a second position (132b), and a third position (132c). The first position (132a) completes a connection from the electrode (110) to electronic muscle stimulator circuitry (140). The second position (132b) is a neutral position in which the switch is normally closed. The third position (132c) completes a connection from the electrode (110) to electro-myography circuitry (150). Similarly, the second switch (134) has three positions, including a first position (134a), a second position (134b), and a third position (134c). The first position (134a) completes a connection from the second electrode (120) to the electronic muscle stimulator circuitry (140). The second position (134b) is a neutral position in which the switch is normally closed. The third position (134c) completes a connection from the second electrode (120) to electro-myography circuitry (150). Accordingly, the switching circuitry (130) provides an electronic interface between the electrodes (110) and (120) and both the electro-myography circuitry (150) and the electronic muscle stimulator (140). As further shown in the interface, a micro-controller (160) is provided in communication with the switching circuitry (130). The micro-controller (160) is designed to communicate with the switching circuitry (130) in order to control functionality of the electrodes, and specifically switching and command. As further shown, the micro-controller (160) is in communication with a short range communication device (170). In one embodiment, the communication between device (170) and micro-controller (160) is bi-directional. Similarly, in one embodiment, the communication device (170) employs a wireless networking technology that uses radio waves to provide wireless high-speed Internet and network connections, also referred to herein as WiFi, or short-range radio technology among Internet devices and between devices and the Internet, also referred to herein as Bluetooth. The micro-controller (160) shown herein functions as a control system to control the switching circuitry among the electrodes in an associated array of electrodes. In one embodiment, an alternative tool may be employed as a form of a control system to control and manage the switching circuitry among the electrodes. Accordingly, the interface shown herein provides external communication with an electrode or an array of electrodes to In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, each of the switches (132) and (134) are three pole switches, and as shown, the respective switch may be in one of three positions. As shown herein, the first electrode (110) is a positive electrode because the associated switch (132) is shown in the first position (132a) completing a connection to the electronic muscle stimulator circuitry (140). Similarly, the second electrode (120) is a negative electrode because the associated switch (134) is shown in the third position (134c) completing a connection to the electro-myography circuitry (150). In one embodiment, the polarities of the electrodes are dynamic and change with the switching circuitry. Specifically, the polarity of each of the electrodes (110) and (120) is set of the respective switch (132) and (134), respectively. The polarity of the first electrode (110) is shown as positive because the switch (132) is in the first position (132a). The polarity of the second electrode (120) is negative because the switch (134) is in the third position (134c). Accordingly, the polarity of the electrodes can change with the switching circuitry, and in one embodiment, the polarity changes dynamically. Referring to FIG. 2, a block diagram (200) is provided illustrating an electro-dermal interface with a five pole switching device. As shown, two electrodes (210) and (220) are in communication with switching circuitry (230). Although only two electrodes (210) and (220) are shown, it is understood that additional electrodes may be employed, each in communication with the switching circuitry (230). As shown, electrode (210) is in communication with a first switch (240) embedded in the switching circuitry (230). Similarly, electrode (220) is in communication with a second switch (260) embedded in switching circuitry (230). As shown herein, both the first switch (240) and the second switch (260) are five pole switching devices. More specifically, the first switch (240) has five positions, including a first position (242), a second position (244), a third position (246), a fourth position (248), and a fifth position (250). The first position (242) completes a positive connection from the electrode (210) to the electronic muscle stimulator (EMS) circuitry (280), and specifically, to the positive polar connection (282) of the EMS circuitry (280). The second position (244) completes a positive connection from the electrode (210) to the electro-myography (EMG) circuitry (290), and specifically, to the positive polar connection (292) of the EMG circuitry. The third position (246) is a neutral position in which the switch is normally closed. The fourth position (248) completes a connection from the electrode (210) to the EMS circuitry (280), and specifically to the negative polar connection (284). The fifth position (250) completes a connection from the electrode (210) to the EMG circuitry (290), and specifically to the negative polar connection (294). Accordingly, the polarity and associated functionality of the first electrode (210) may change based upon one of five positions in the associated switch (240). As shown in FIG. 2, there are two electrodes. The second electrode (220) has similar switching capabilities to that shown with the first electrode (210). Electrode (220) is in communication with the second switch (260) embedded in the switching circuitry (230). As shown herein, the second switch (260) is a five pole switching device. More specifically, the second switch (260) has five positions, including a first position (262), a second position (264), a third position (266), a fourth position (268), and a fifth position (270). The first position (262) completes a positive connection from the electrode (220) to the EMS circuitry (280), and specifically, to the positive polar connection (282) of the EMS circuitry (280). The second position (264) completes a positive connection from the electrode (220) to the EMG circuitry (290), and specifically, to the positive polar connection (292) of the EMG circuitry. The third position (266) is a neutral position in which the switch is normally closed. The fourth position (268) completes a connection from the electrode (220) to the EMS circuitry (280), and specifically to the negative polar connection (284). The fifth position (270) completes a connection from the electrode (220) to the EMG circuitry (290), and specifically to the negative polar connection (294). Accordingly, the polarity and associated functionality of the second electrode (220) may change based upon one of five positions in the associated switch (260). As further shown in the interface, a micro-controller (296) is provided in communication with the switching circuitry (230). The micro-controller (296) is designed to communicate with the switching circuitry (230) in order to control functionality of the electrodes, and specifically switching and command. As further show, the micro-controller (296) is in communication with a short range communication device (298). In one embodiment, the communication between device (298) and micro-controller (296) is bi-directional. Similarly, in one embodiment, the communication device (298) employs a wireless networking technology that uses radio waves to provide wireless high-speed Internet and network connections, also referred to herein as WiFi, or short-range radio technology among Internet devices and between devices and the Internet, also referred to herein as Bluetooth. Accordingly, the interface shown herein provides external communication with an electrode or an array of electrodes to support and enable control of functionality from a remote location. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, each of the switches (132) and (134) are three pole switches, and as shown, the respective switch may be in one of three positions. The position of the switch changes the functionality of the associated electrode. Similarly, in the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, each of the switches (240) and (260) are five pole switches, and as shown, the respective switch may be in one of five positions. The polarity of the electrodes can change with the switching circuitry, and in one embodiment, the polarity changes dynamically. Referring to FIG. 3, a block diagram (300) is provided illustrating an electrode pair switching system for communication. As shown herein, there are four electrodes, including electrode1 (310), electrode2 (320), electrode3 (330), and electrode4 (340). Although in one embodiment, there may be a smaller or larger quantity of electrodes in the system, and as such, the quantity shown herein should not be considered limiting. Each of the electrodes (310), (320), (330), and (340) are in communication with a controller (350) via a set of associated switches. In one embodiment, the switches are three pole switching devices as shown and described in FIG. 1, or five pole switching devices as shown and described in FIG. 2, and hereby incorporated by reference. Electrode1 (310) is shown supported by switch (312), electrode2 (320) is shown supported by switch (322), electrode3 (330) is shown supported by switch (332), and electrode4 (340) is shown supported by switch (342). Furthermore as shown in FIG. 3, bi-directional inter-electrode communication is supported. Specifically, bi-directional communication between electrode1 (310) and electrode3 (330) is shown at (336). Similarly, bi-directional communication between electrode1 (310) and electrode2 (320) is shown at (316), bi-directional communication between electrode2 (320) and electrode4 (340) is shown at (326), bi-directional communication between electrode3 (330) and electrode4 (340) is shown at (346), bi-directional communication between electrode1 (310) and electrode4 (340) is shown at (356), and bi-directional communication between electrode3 (330) and electrode2 (320) is shown at (366). Furthermore, the electrodes shown herein (310), (320), (330), and (340) may be wired, or in one embodiment wireless, while maintaining the switching and communication functions shown herein. Accordingly, bi-directional communication is supported between each pair of electrodes in the array. The system(s) shown in FIGS. 1-3, illustrate alignment and connection of electrodes with switching capabilities. The electrodes may be employed for electrical stimulation to an adjacent surface, or in one embodiment, for messaging, also referred to herein as communication. Referring to FIG. 4, a block diagram (400) of an example concurrent use of pairs of electrodes. As shown, there are two pairs of electrodes, each pair horizontally aligned. More specifically, the first pair (405) includes electrode0 (410) and electrode1 (420), and the second pair (415) includes electrode2 (430) and electrode3 (440). Each electrode is in communication with a switch. Specifically, electrode0 (410) is in communication with switch0 (412), electrode1 (420) is in communication with switch1 (422), and the second pair (415) includes electrode2 (430) is in communication with switch2 (432), and electrode3 (440) is in communication with switch3 (442). In the embodiment shown herein, electrode0 (410) has a positive polarity as shown by the switch (414) connected to the positive EMS circuit (416), and electrode1 (420) has a negative polarity as shown by the switch (424) connected to the negative EMS circuitry (426). As articulated above, the EMS circuit stimulates the muscle. The electrodes are limited to support messaging between the positive and negative electrodes. More specifically, the messaging support herein is from electrode1 (420) to electrode0 (410) to drive muscle potential, e.g. contraction or expansion. Accordingly, as shown herein in the first pair (405), the EMS messaging is ON and the EMG messaging is OFF. As further shown herein, the second pair (415), including electrode2 (430) and electrode3 (440), is shown with EMS messaging OFF and EMG messaging ON. More specifically, electrode2 (430) has a positive polarity as shown by the switch (434) connected to the positive EMG circuit (436), and electrode3 (440) has a negative polarity as shown by the switch (444) connected to the negative EMG circuitry (446). The two horizontal pairs (405) and (415) support concurrent use with messaging between the positive electrode and the negative electrode in the pair arrangement. In one embodiment, the first pair of electrodes (405) drives muscle contraction and expansion, and the second pair of electrodes (415) drives messaging, with the muscle stimulation in the first pair extending from the second electrode, electrode1 (420) to the first electrode, electrode0 (410), and with messaging in the second pair (415) extending from the fourth electrode, electrode3 (440) to the third electrode, electrode2 (430). In one embodiment, both pairs may be employed for EMS messaging, or both pairs may be employed for EMG messaging, or in one embodiment, the EMS and EMG messaging pairs may be inverted from that shown herein. Accordingly, the horizontal alignment of the electrodes and pairing thereof supports concurrent use of both pairs of electrodes for EMS and/or EMG messaging. Referring to FIG. 5, a block diagram (500) of an example use of pairs of electrodes with diagonal communication. Similar to the configuration of FIG. 4, there are four electrodes, including electrode0 (510), electrode1 (520), electrode2 (530), and electrode3 (540). Each electrode is in communication with a switch. Specifically, electrode0 (510) is in communication with switch0 (512), electrode1 (520) is in communication with switch1 (522), electrode2 (530) is in communication with switch2 (532), and electrode3 (540) is in communication with switch3 (542). In the embodiment shown herein, electrode0 (510) is not connected (514) as shown at (516) by the switch (512) and electrode3 (540) is also not connected (544) as shown at (546) with the switch (546). Electrode1 (520) is in communication with electrode2 (530). More specifically, electrode1 (520) has a negative polarity as shown at (526) with the switch (522) connected to the negative EMS circuitry (524), and electrode2 (530) has a positive polarity (534) as shown at (536) with the switch (532). As articulated above, the EMS circuit stimulates the muscle. The electrodes are limited to support messaging between the positive and negative electrodes. More specifically, the messaging support herein is from electrode1 (520) to electrode3 (530) to drive muscle contraction or expansion. Accordingly, as shown in the example herein, the first and fourth electrodes (510) and (540), respectively, are not connected, and communication is supported diagonally across the array between the second and third electrodes (520) and (530) to support EMS messaging there between. As shown in FIG. 5, there are various combinations of electrodes, and the pairings are not limited to a one to one relationship. In the example shown herein, any one of the electrodes (510), (520), (530), and (540) could be communicating with one, two, or three other electrodes in the array. For example, based on the array shown herein, the electrodes can have a 1:1 relationship, a 1:2 relationship, or a 1:3 relationship, with one switch being positive, and the other switches being negative or grounded. An example of a 1:1 relationship is with electrode0 (510) in communication with electrode1 (520), electrode0 (510) in communication with electrode2 (530), and electrode0 (510) in communication with electrode3 (540). An example of a 1:2 relationship is with electrode0 (510) in communication with electrode1 (520) and electrode2 (530), and electrode0 (510) in communication with and electrode2 (530) and electrode3 (540). Similarly, an example of a 1:3 relationship is with electrode0 (510) in communication with electrode1 (520), electrode2 (530), and electrode3 (540). In an embodiment with a larger array, the combination of communications among electrodes may be expanded to include every electrode in the array. Referring to FIG. 6, a block diagram (600) of an example use of pairs of electrodes with diagonal communication for EMG messaging. Similar to the configuration and functionality of FIG. 5, there are four electrodes, including electrode0 (610), electrode1 (620), electrode2 (630), and electrode3 (640). Each electrode is in communication with a switch. Specifically, electrode0 (610) is in communication with switch0 (612), electrode1 (620) is in communication with switch1 (622), electrode2 (630) is in communication with switch2 (632), and electrode3 (640) is in communication with switch3 (642). In the embodiment shown herein, electrode0 (610) is not connected (614) as shown by the switch (616) and electrode3 (640) is also not connected (644) as shown by the switch (646). Electrode1 (620) is in communication with electrode2 (630). More specifically, electrode1 (620) has a negative polarity as shown by the switch (622) connected to the negative EMG circuitry (624) by switch (626), and electrode2 (630) has a positive polarity as shown by the switch (636) connected to the positive EMG circuitry (634). As articulated above, the EMG circuit measures electrical activity of the heart. The electrodes are limited to support messaging between the positive and negative electrodes. More specifically, the messaging support herein is from electrode1 (620) to electrode3 (630) to drive electrical stimulation. Accordingly, as shown in the example herein, the first and fourth electrodes (610) and (640), respectively, are not connected, and communication is supported diagonally across the array between the second and third electrodes (620) and (630) to support EMG sensing therebetween. As articulated above, an array of electrodes is provided to support messaging and stimulation. Referring to FIG. 7, a flow chart (700) is provided illustrating a process for calibrating the array of electrodes. In one embodiment, the electrodes and that associated electro-dermal interface are embedded in a garment, which when worn, enables the electrodes to be placed in close proximity to select body parts to support EMG, EMS, and galvanic skin response. A garment may be used to embed the electrodes. Specifically, the electrodes may be embedded in, for instance, a t-shirt or undergarment(s) in conjunction with a conductive patch. The garments are not conductive although they comprise a conductive patch. Electrodes in the outer garment approximately line up with the patches to transmit the electrical signal from the electrodes. The surface of the garment impacts how approximately the electrodes in the outer garment align with the patches in the under garment. The alignment maximizes contact density in areas, that is, the number of contacts per square inch. In one embodiment, the undergarment is machine washable. In one embodiment, the apparatus described herein above is low power and low weight, embedded within a special undershirt. Alternatively, the apparatus is embedded in an outer garment in conjunction with an undergarment with a conductive patch. The undergarment is non-conductive or comprised of a non-conductive material except for the conductive material patches. The electrodes in the outer garment lines up with the patches to transmit the signals. The alignment may be less than an exact alignment based on the surface area of the garments. Regardless, the apparatus attempts to align the outer garment with the patches to maximize contact density in those areas. In an embodiment, the contacts per square inch are determined. As shown, the garment is fitted to the subject (702). Messaging takes place between pairs of electrodes. As such, each electrode pair is assigned a signature. Electrode pair combinations are counted and initialized (704). The variable XTotal is assigned to the quantity of electrode combination pairs (706), and an associated counting variable is initialized (708). A signal is applied to electrode pairX (710). Thereafter, the associated signal pair strength is measured for pairX (712), and a signature carrier frequency is assigned to the electrode pairX (714). Following the assignment at step (714), the electrode pair counting variable is incremented (716). It is then determined if all of the electrode pairs have been assigned a signature frequency (718). A negative response to the determination at step (718) is followed by a return to step (710). However, a positive response to the determination at step (718) terminates the electrode pair calibration process (720). As shown in FIG. 7, each pair of electrodes in the array is assigned a signal with an embedded signature. It is important to mitigate noise between the different electrode pairs. For any pair of electrodes in the array, of which there are multiple pairings, noise evaluation is conducted. Referring to FIG. 8, a block diagram (800) is provided demonstrating an example of noise calibration in an array of electrodes. As shown, there are six electrodes in the array, including electrode0 (810), electrode1 (820), electrode2 (830), electrode3 (840), electrode4 (850), and electrode5 (860). For purposes of description, electrode2 (830) and electrode3 (840) form a listening pair (870) in this example. The signal of the listening pair (870) is compared to all other pairs or possible pairings of electrodes. In the example array, there are six pairings of electrodes in addition to the listening pair (870). The pairings include a first pair (880) of electrode0 (810) and electrode1 (820), a second pair (882) of electrode0 (810) and electrode4 (850), a third pair (884) of electrode0 (810) and electrode5 (860), a fourth pair (886) of electrode1 (820) and electrode4 (850), a fifth pair (888) of electrode1 (820) and electrode5 (860), and a sixth pair (890) of electrode4 (850) and electrode5 (860). The listening pair (870) is calibrated by listening for signature noise from all other combinations of electrode pairs (880)-(890). The calibration shown in this example is a form of initial pairing calibration. In one embodiment, the calibration shown herein can be expanded to a one to many or many to one electrode pairing. As shown and described above with respect to FIG. 7, each pair of electrodes is assigned a signature signal. In one embodiment, each pair is assigned a signature EMS signal separate from assignment of an EMG signal. Similarly, in one embodiment, each pair is assigned a base signal in the frequency range of 80-100 Hz. Similarly, in one embodiment, a modulated high frequency carrier signal identifies signaling electrodes, and the frequency varies for each electrode, thereby providing a unique signature to each electrode pair. The electrodes shown in the embodiments of FIGS. 1-3 may come in different forms to sense and communicate with various forms of data. For example, in one embodiment, one or more of the electrodes in the array may be in the form of an electro-dermal electrode to measure resistance of adjacent tissue to current. In one embodiment, the measured resistance may be compared to a threshold value, and if the resistance exceeds this value one or more electrodes that are proximal to the measured resistance may be disable, and at the same time a message associated with the measured resistance may be re-routed. Furthermore, the electrodes shown in FIG. 3 are mounted on or within a garment, which may include any form of garment, including, but not limited to, an undergarment and an outer-garment. Regardless of the form of the garment, the electrodes are mapped to the subject, so that different electrodes are mapped to specific areas of the body of the subject. Similarly, the electrodes support simultaneous communication between different pairs. For example, one set of circuits may measure and drive two electrode pairs simultaneously. The switches described above allow both driving and monitoring at the same time. For example, one pair of electrodes within the array may be signaling at the same time as another pair of electrodes may be reading a signal. Similarly, one pair of electrodes in the array may be configured to EMS circuitry at the same time as another pair in the array is configured for EMG circuitry. The two forms of circuitry are not mutually exclusive. As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, the calibration process includes testing signal strength to each electrode pair in the array, which may be employed for both mapping and de-confliction purposes. With the electrodes in an array arrangement it is critical that any interference between electrodes be minimized so that appropriate signals are communicated to the proper electrode or mapping of electrodes. In one embodiment, the interference between signals may occur if the electrodes are positioned within close proximity. The interference in the signals may be identified by proper encoding of the signal, e.g. can differentiate between detected signals. In one embodiment, the de-confliction is referred to as spatial de-confliction, with electrode data from a first electrode in the array at a first location messaging data to a second electrode in the array at a second location, wherein the electrodes are spaced apart to mitigate interference. The interference assessment and re-assignment shown and described above is for a single electrode array. In one embodiment, there may be multiple arrays of electrodes that are employed as a communication tool. For example, a first array may be in communication with a first entity, and a second array may be in communication with a second entity. Referring to FIG. 9, a block diagram (900) is provided illustrating multiple arrays of electrodes. As shown, there are two arrays of electrodes, including a first array (910) and a second array (950). The first array (910) is shown local to a first member (920), and the second array (950) is shown local to a second team member (960). More specifically, the first array (910) is shown with three electrodes (912), (914), and (916), and the second array (950) is shown with three electrodes (952), (954), and (956). However, the quantity of electrodes in each array (910) and (950) should not be considered limiting. The first and second electrode arrays (910) and (950), respectively, form a team. In one embodiment, the team may be expanded to include additional members. The electrode arrays and associated signals there between may serve as a communication interface between the entities, also referred to herein as team members. In one embodiment, the one or more of the electrodes (912) of the first entity may sense an increase in heart rate of the first entity, and this sensed increase is communicated (930) to the second entity (950). In one embodiment, the increased heart rate may be transmitted as a signal to an electrode of the second team member (950). The team may be expanded to include a robotic asset (970). As shown, the robotic asset (970) is in communication with both the first array (910) and the second array (950) at (972) and (974), respectively. The robotic asset (970) is configured to both send one or more signals to the team members, and to receive one or more signals from the team members. More specifically, the communication with the robotic asset may be to one or more specific electrodes in the team. In one embodiment, the electrodes are separately addressable. Similarly, in one embodiment, an interference assessment may be conducted between each array in the system, similar to the assessment shown and described in FIG. 8 but expanded to the respective arrays in the system. The interference assessment between or among arrays mitigates signal interference among electrodes within a single array, and among electrodes between two or more arrays. The array of electrodes shown and described herein is not limited to a single garment. Furthermore, the electrodes are not limited by a wired connection. In one embodiment, the electrodes may be wireless. Similarly, in one embodiment, a select set of electrodes may have a wired connection, while one or more electrodes may be in a wireless connection with the array. Furthermore, the electrodes shown and described in FIGS. 1-5 pertain to measurement of resistance of adjacent tissue. However, other forms of electrodes should not be excluded. In one embodiment, the electrode may sense heart rate, and employ the sensed heart rate with the electrode array. In one embodiment, a baseline heart rate may be attained, so that the sensing of the heart rate may include variability of the heart rate as compared to the baseline. Similarly, in one embodiment, the electrodes may be configured for sensitivity, including sensing an increased heart rate with minimal activity.
