However, the present invention is not limited to a specific mechanical apparatus, but may be variously implemented by those skilled in the art. FIG. 4 is a conceptual diagram showing a motion recognizing unit and a motion processing unit according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 4, the motion recognizing unit 400 may recognize the motion of the user U to generate the motion information. The motion recognizing unit 400 may include a plurality of cameras in order to recognize the motion information of the user U. In another method, the motion recognizing unit 400 may recognize a movement, an action, and a motion of the user U using a signal generating apparatus and a predetermined sensor and convert the recognized movement, action, and motion into an electrical signal. As a motion recognition method, various methods may be used, and the present invention is not limited to a special motion recognition method. The motion processing unit 500 may reflect the motion of the user U in the screen unit 200 based on the motion information received from the motion recognizing unit 400. Viewing the screen unit 200FIG. 4, it may be confirmed that a character or an avatar UA having the same shape as that of the user U is displayed on the screen unit 200. In another exemplary embodiment, the user U may set a shape displayed on the screen unit 200 to a specific character shape. Comparing FIGS. 4 and 5 with each other, it may be confirmed that a form of the character UA displayed on the screen unit 200 is changed depending on movement of the user U. In order to reflect the form of the user U in the screen unit 200, the motion recognizing unit 400 may include cameras, or the like, and the number of cameras recognizing the form of the user U may be plural. The motion processing unit 500 may use a predetermined motion algorithm in order to represent the form of the user U at various angles. However, the present invention is not limited to a specific motion algorithm. FIG. 6 is a conceptual diagram showing a process in which a user moves to a plurality of screens by a screen moving unit according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 6, the screen moving unit 600 may request the motion processing unit 500 to reflect the motion of the user U in the screen unit 200 corresponding to a screen moving signal when the motion recognizing unit 400 receives the screen moving signal from the user U. The user U may transfer the screen moving signal to the motion recognizing unit 400. The screen moving signal may include a mechanical or electrical signal generated by the user U. The motion recognizing unit 400 may transfer the screen moving signal to the screen moving unit 600. Here, the screen moving unit 600 may determine the screen unit 200 corresponding to the screen moving signal and request the motion processing unit 500 to reflect the motion of the user U in the determined screen unit 200. Although the form of the user U may be confirmed on the screen unit 200 positioned at the front in FIG. 3, it may be confirmed that the form of the user U appears in the screen unit 200a positioned at the left by transmitting the screen moving signal. For example, in the case in which an intermediate level course is present on the screen unit 200a positioned at the left during a period in which the user U performs an exercise at a beginner course displayed on the screen unit 200 before moving to the screen, he/she may move to the screen unit 200a positioned at the left by a method of transmitting the screen moving signal to the motion recognizing unit 400 and then start the exercise at the intermediate level course. FIG. 7 is a diagram showing a method in which a screen connecting unit according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention connects an image reproduced by a screen unit. Referring to FIG. 7, the experience ride representation apparatus 10 for a real-sense media service based on a multi-vision according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may further include a screen connecting unit 620. The screen connecting unit 620 may connect real-sense media contents reproduced on the screen unit 200 before the screen moving signal is received and real-sense media contents reproduced on the screen unit 200a corresponding to the screen moving signal to each other, when the screen moving unit 600 reflects the motion of the user U in the screen unit 200a corresponding to the screen moving signal. Although the form UA of the user U is reflected in the screen unit 200a positioned at the left depending on the screen moving signal of the user U in FIG. 6, the form UA of the user U is reflected in the screen unit 200a positioned at the left and a background screen image that has appeared on the front screen unit 200 is also reproduced on the screen unit 200a positioned at the left through the screen connecting unit 620 in FIG. 7. That is, the real-sense media contents reproduced on the screen unit 200 positioned at the front of FIG. 6 correspond to the real-sense media contents reproduced on the screen unit 200a positioned at the left of FIG. 7. Therefore, the user may enjoy riding while moving to the plurality of screen units 200, 200a, and 200b through the screen moving unit 600 and receive seamless real-sense media contents through the screen connecting unit 620. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the screen moving unit 600 and the screen connecting unit 620 may be simultaneously operated. Although only three screen units 200, 200a, and 200b have been shown for assisting in the understanding in FIG. 6, when six screen units 200, 200a, 200b, 200c, 200d, and 200e are provided as shown in FIG. 8, the user U may freely move to the six screen units 200, 200a, 200b, 200c, 200d, and 200e. FIGS. 9 and 10 are conceptual diagrams showing that a plurality of users share the screen unit with each other by a metaverse server according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.

In FIG. 9, a user A U1 is performing riding through the screen unit 200a positioned at the left. In FIG. 9, a user B U2 is performing riding through the screen unit 200b positioned at the right. In FIG. 10, the user A U1 and the user B U2 share the screen unit 200 positioned at the center with each other. Here, the metaverse server 700 may provide the metaverse contents and the metaverse real-sense effect to the screen unit 200 positioned at the center. The user A U1 may perform the riding while sharing the screen unit 200 positioned at the center with the user B U2. Here, the screen unit 200a positioned at the left of the user A U1 may be a personal screen unit 200a of the user A U1. The screen unit 200a positioned at the left of the user A U1 may still receive the real-sense media contents and the real-sense effect data from the content server 100. The user B U2 may perform the riding while sharing the screen unit 200 positioned at the center with the user A U1. Here, the screen unit 200b positioned at the right of the user B U2 may be a personal screen unit 200b of the user B U2. The screen unit 200b positioned at the right of the user B U2 may still receive the real-sense media contents and the real-sense effect data from the content server 100. FIG. 11 is a diagram showing a kind of motion information recognized by the motion recognizing unit according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention from a motion of the user. Referring to FIG. 11, the motion information may include pitch motion information, yaw motion information, and roll motion information. The pitch motion information may include information on a motion ascending or descending based on a direction in which the user U advances. Here, the direction in which the user U advances may be an increase direction in an X axis 901. The pitch motion information may include a motion ascending in a positive (+) direction of a Z axis 903 and a motion descending in a negative (−) direction of the Z axis 903 when the direction in which the user U advances is the X axis 901. That is, the pitch motion information may include a motion rotating based on a Y axis 902. The yaw motion information may include motion information on a motion rotating to the left or the right based on the direction in which the user U advances. The yaw motion information may include a motion rotating based on the Z axis 903 when the direction in which the user U advances is the X axis 901. The roll motion information may include motion information on a motion inclined to the left or the right based on the direction in which the user U advances. The roll motion information may include a motion rotating based on the X axis 901 when the direction in which the user U advances is the X axis 901. When the motion recognizing unit 400 receives the motion information of the user U including the pitch motion information, the yaw motion information, and the roll motion information, the motion of the user U may be reflected in the screen unit 200 through the motion processing unit 500. FIG. 12 is a conceptual diagram showing that a topographic information providing unit according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides topographic information included in contents to the user. Referring to FIG. 12, a topographic information providing unit 720 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention may obtain topographic information from the real-sense media contents or the metaverse contents and provide a real-sense effect corresponding to the topographic information to the user U. Real-sense media contents ascending in an advance direction are reproduced on a screen unit 205. The topographic information providing unit 720 may obtain the topographic information of the real-sense media contents reproduced on the screen unit 205 and provide an effect corresponding to the topographic information to the user. When the motion recognizing unit 400 generates the motion information of the user U and the motion processing unit 500 reflects the motion of the user U in the screen unit 205 based on the motion information, the topographic information providing unit 720 may request the screen unit 205 to correct the motion of the user U depending on the topographic information and reflect the corrected motion. For example, in the case in which the user U transmits a signal for increasing a speed of the avatar to the motion recognizing unit 400, even in the case in which the motion recognizing unit 400 generates speed increase motion information and transmits the speed increase motion information to the motion processing unit 500, the topographic information providing unit 720 may obtain topographic information indicating that a current topography is an ascent and provide the obtained topographic information to the motion processing unit 500, thereby allowing a speed decreased from a speed requested by the user U by a predetermined amount to be reflected in the avatar. In another example, even in the case in which the motion of the user U is recognized to generate the motion information including the pitch motion information, the yaw motion information, and the roll motion information and transfer the generated motion information to the motion processing unit 500, the motion processing unit 500 may reflect a corrected motion in the screen unit 205 in consideration of the topographic information received from the topographic information providing unit 720. In addition, the topographic information providing unit 720 may provide a physical stimulus to the user U by a method of transmitting the topographic information to the real-sense device 300. For example, in the case in which the topographic information providing unit 720 obtains topographic information to which a predetermined gradient is applied from the real-sense media contents, it may allow the predetermined gradient to be felt through a predetermined apparatus connected to the real-sense device 300. FIG. 13 is a flow chart showing an experience ride representation method for a real-sense media service based on a multi-vision according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.
