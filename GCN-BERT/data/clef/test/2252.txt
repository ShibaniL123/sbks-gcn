2-Isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl)aniline dihydrochloride (C2, di-HCl salt)
Aqueous HCl (26 ml of a 8 M solution) was added to methyl 4-(4-amino-5-isopropoxy-2-methylphenyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate (1.00 g, 3.26 mmol) and the mixture was stirred for 16 hours at room temperature. After washing with dichloromethane (30 ml), the aqueous phase was neutralized with aqueous NaOH (1 M solution). The neutralized aqueous phase was extracted with toluene (3Ã—50 ml) and the combined organic extracts were treated with HCl (2.6 ml of a 5 M solution in isopropanol). Evaporation of the volatiles under vacuum yielded 2-isopropoxy-5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl)aniline dihydrochloride (1.05 g, 49% yield).
