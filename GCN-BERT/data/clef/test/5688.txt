BACKGROUND Different methods have been developed to produce fast pyrolysis oil. In some cases, the oil may be converted to liquid fuels by upgrading with hydrogen. Biomass may also be utilized in some cases to produce the fast pyrolysis oil. While various techniques may exist to generate liquid fuel from biomass or other carbon-oxygen-hydrogen (C—O—H) compounds or chemicals, there may still be a general need for the development of alternative techniques that may provide more direct methods for generating liquid hydrocarbon fuels or hydrocarbon chemicals from C—O—H compounds. Furthermore, different methods have been developed to capture aerosols. These methods may include different inertial, gravitational, electrostatic, and/or diffusion techniques, for example. While various techniques may exist to capture aerosols, there may still be a general need for the development of alternative and/or improved techniques that may be utilized to capture aerosols, including hydrocarbon aerosols.

The system of claim 9, further comprising one or more couplers configured to couple one or more of the one or more distillers to the aerosol gathering chamber to augment the material in the bulk liquid phase with all or part of the distilled gathered portions of the one or more aerosol components. 11. The system of claim 1, further comprising a mesh of a solid material disposed within the aerosol gathering chamber configured to increase the area of contact between the aerosol and the material in the bulk liquid phase and through which the aerosol and material in the bulk liquid phase are passed. 12. The system of claim 1, further comprising a plurality of baffles disposed within the aerosol gathering chamber configured to increase a path length through the material in the bulk liquid phase. 13. The system of claim 12, further comprising a mesh of solid material disposed around the plurality of baffles within the aerosol gathering chamber configured to increase the area of contact between the aerosol and the material in the bulk liquid phase and through which the aerosol and material in the liquid phase are passed. 14. The system of claim 1, further comprising one or more ports coupled with the aerosol gathering chamber to allow removal of water from the aerosol gathering chamber. 15. The system of claim 1, further comprising one or more ports coupled with the aerosol gathering chamber to allow removal of a portion of at least the portion of the one or more gathered aerosol components from the aerosol gathering chamber. 16. The system of claim 1, further comprising one or more aerosol production chambers coupled with the aerosol gathering chamber. 17. The system of claim 16, wherein the one or more aerosol production chambers comprises an aerosol production chamber producing at least a hydrocarbon compound or a component of a liquid hydrocarbon. 18. The system of claim 17, wherein the aerosol comprising at least the hydrocarbon compound or the component of the liquid hydrocarbon is produced from biomass. 19. The system of claim 17, wherein the hydrocarbon compound or the component of the liquid hydrocarbon comprises at least a hydrocarbon fuel. 20. The system of claim 17, wherein the hydrocarbon compound or the component of a liquid hydrocarbon comprises at least a hydrocarbon chemical.
