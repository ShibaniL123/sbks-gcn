TECHNICAL FIELD The present application relates to a loading unit assembly and linear surgical stapler with loading unit assembly, which belongs to the technical field of medical instruments. BACKGROUND Linear surgical staplers are widely used in surgical operations for wound closure, and internal tissue closure and excision. With the development of the surgical operation, now, people have been more and more inclined to minimally invasive operation. Broadly speaking, a surgery which reduces trauma can be known as minimally invasive operation. While, generally speaking, the minimally invasive surgery is referring to the endoscopic operation in a narrow sense. For the endoscopic surgery, generally, a doctor only needs to open a few of holes and puts surgical staplers used for excision and anastomosis of tissues and auxiliary equipment into the patient's body for surgery through the holes. The trauma of minimally invasive operation brings to the patient is very small and the patient can recover in a short period of time. Therefore, the minimally invasive operation has been paid more and more attention. U.S. Pat. No. 7,753,246 discloses a linear surgical stapler used in minimally invasive operation, which includes a body portion, and the body portion includes a shell and a firing handle pivotally arranged on the shell, the shell having a relatively movable firing ejector rod therein, the firing ejector rod being able to push the loading unit assembly which located at the front end of the shell to carry out anastomosis and excision. Specifically, the loading unit assembly includes a staple cartridge frame and an anvil pivotally connected with the staple cartridge frame. The staple cartridge frame includes a detachable staple cartridge which includes a series of staple retention holes, generally 4 or 6 rows, accommodating staple pushers and staples. The anvil is arranged with staple forming grooves corresponding to the staple retention holes. The loading unit assembly further includes a movable driver beam arranged in a housing of the loading unit assembly. The driver beam has a knife at the distal end thereof to close the staple cartridge and the anvil when the driver beam is advanced. The knife has a knife blade arranged on its distal central to sever tissues clamped between the staple cartridge and the anvil as the driver beam is advanced. Two wedges are arranged abutting opposite side of the knife blade, that when the knife is advanced, the knife actuates the wedges to push the staple pushers out of the staple cartridge, and the staple pushers sequentially eject staples from the staple cartridge to staple tissues clamped between the cartridge and the anvil. In the prior art, the loading unit assembly is replaceable from the body portion. When the loading unit assembly assembled on the body portion, the housing of loading unit assembly is inserted into an outer tube distant the staple cartridge. Meanwhile, a lug defined at a proximal end of the driver beam receives in a receiving space located on a distal end of the firing ejector rod; then the loading unit assembly is rotated to engage the housing and tube together and axially fix the driver beam and the firing ejector rod together. After the loading unit assembly fixed to the body portion, a firing of loading unit assembly can be processed subsequently. After the assembly of the surgical stapler, usually, it needs a long-distance transportation to other places. In the transport process, it is possible that the surgical stapler is shaked or impacted and results in the firing ejector rod is advanced and the staples are fired. Or, after firing of the surgical stapler for the first time, doctors need to replace the loading unit assembly. If the doctor is lack of experience, the loading unit assembly may not be fully installed in place. In the above two cases, if the doctor fires the surgical stapler, that will lead to a serious damage to the surgical stapler, or even cause a medical accident.

ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS Embodiment 1 Referring to FIG. 1, the present application discloses a linear surgical stapler used in minimally invasive operation. In accordance with the prior art, the linear surgical stapler includes a shell, a tube 10 arranged at a distal end of the shell and detachably fixed with a housing, and a firing ejector rod 11 movably received in the tube 10 and selectively engaging with a knife driver beam 6. At the distal end of the tube 10, a loading unit assembly of the linear surgical stapler is provided detachably. Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the loading unit assembly of the linear surgical stapler includes: a staple cartridge frame 1 located at a distal end thereof and an anvil 2 pivotally connected with staple cartridge frame 1. The staple cartridge frame 1 includes a detachable staple cartridge 3 which including a series of staple retention holes to accommodate staple pushers and staples. A housing (not shown) is at a proximal end thereof, the housing receives the knife driver beam 6 movably therein; the knife driver beam 6 defining a knife at a distal end thereof, both upper and below portion of the knife defining a protrusion and the knife is a I shape knife 7. In a advancement process of the I shape knife 7, it presses the expanded tissues to make the tissues thin and uniform, and further, the I shape knife 7 close the staple cartridge 3 and the anvil 2. The I shape knife 7 has a knife blade arranged on its distal central, to sever tissue clamped between the staple cartridge 3 and the anvil 2 as the I shape knife 7 is advanced. Two wedges are arranged abutting opposite side of the knife blade, so that when the I shape knife 7 is advanced, the I shape knife 7 actuates the wedges to push the staple pushers out of the staple cartridge 3, and further the staple pushers sequentially eject staples from the staple cartridge 3 to staple tissues clamped between the staple cartridge 3 and the anvil 2. The housing and tube 10 are relatively fixed or relatively separated from each other. When the loading unit assembly is at its initial position, the housing and tube 10 are not relatively fixed; when the loading unit assembly is at its working position, the housing and tube 10 are relatively fixed, and the knife driver beam 6 is axially fixed with the firing ejector rod 11 axially. Specifically, the knife driver beam 6 has a claw portion 19 at a proximal end thereof, and the firing ejector rod 11 defines a through opening slot 20 at a distal end thereof, the knife driver beam 6 and the firing ejector rod 11 being axially fixed together via the engagement of claw portion 19 and the opening slot 20. Of course, an axial match tolerance is allowable between the knife driver beam 6 and the firing ejector rod 11, leading to a slightly relative displacement between the knife driver beam 6 and the firing ejector rod 11. The knife driver beam 6 has a movable safety block 12 defined on a surface of a proximal end thereof, and a protrusion 13 is correspondingly defined on the staple cartridge frame 1. The safety block 12 is a flake structure. A first surface of the safety block 12 is connected with two springs 15, and the other end of the spring 15 is connected with the staple cartridge frame 1. With this arrangement, when the loading unit assembly is at its initial position, the acting force of the spring 15 is acting on the first side of the safety block 12, making a second side of the safety block 12 close to a proximal side of the knife driver beam 6. The safety block 12 is provided with two through holes, wherein the knife driver beam 6 is fixed with two pins 16, and the pins 16 pass through the corresponding through holes. The spring 15 surrounds an outer side of the pin 16. Referring to FIGS. 3-5, when the loading unit assembly is at the initial position, the housing and the tube 10 are not relatively fixed. Under this position, a front surface 14 located at a distal end of the safety block 12 abuts against the protrusion 13 and limits a movement of the knife driver beam 6 and the safety block 12. A cross section at the distal end of the firing ejector rod 11 is in an “I” shape with a notch (21) defined therein. When the loading unit assembly is at its intermediate status as shown in the FIGS. 6-8, the housing is just inserted into the tube 10, that is when the claw portion 19 of the knife driver beam 6 extends into the firing ejector rod 11, the safety block 12 is located in the notch 21. Now, under this status, there is no relative displacement between the knife driver beam 6 and the safety block 12. Referring to FIGS. 9-12, when the loading unit assembly is at its working position, the knife driver beam 6 and the firing ejector rod 11 are axially fixed together fully, thus the claw portion 19 is axially fixed with the opening slot 20 via a rotation of the housing. Under this position, the knife driver beam 6 rotates relative to the firing ejector rod 11. At this time, an “I” shaped actuating face 22 of the firing ejector rod 11 actuates the safety block 12 to overcome the acting force of the springs 15 and to be away from the knife driver beam 6. In a direction of the movement of the knife driver beam 6, an axial plane that the safety block 12 arranged thereon is parallel to another axial plane that the protrusion 13 arranged thereon, to make the front surface 14 located at a distal end of the safety block 12 being relatively apart from the protrusion 13. Since a distance between the safety block 12 and the knife driver beam 6 is greater than a thickness of the protrusion 13, that the safety block 12 and the knife driver beam 6 can escape from the limitation of the protrusion 13 and can move along the axis of the staple cartridge frame 1. When replacing the loading unit assembly, rotate the housing in a reverse direction, then the loading unit assembly detaches form the tube 10. And meanwhile, the knife driver beam 6 is separated from the firing ejector rod 11. At this time, under an acting force of the springs 15, the safety block 12 resets to limit a movement of the knife driver beam 6 again. In the present description, the words describing position and direction are all based on the instrument operator as a reference. The proximal end refers to the end close to the operator and the distal end refers to the end far from the operator. The present application discloses a variety of embodiments. For example, if the protrusion 13 is defined on the housing, under a cooperation of the safety block 12, this arrangement also can play a safety role.
