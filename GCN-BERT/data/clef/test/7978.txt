3-(2,4-Difluorophenyl)-1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-[1R)-1-(3-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)ethyl]-1H-thieno[23-c]pyrazole-5-carboxamide
Step A: 3,5-Dibromo-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde
3,5-Dibromo-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehyde (987.9 mg, 3.89 mmol) and potassium carbonate (1.613 g, 11.67 mmol) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (39 mL) at 25 °C under Ar. 4-methoxybenzyl bromide (617 µl, 4.28 mmol) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir for 2 h 10 min. The reaction was stopped, quenched by addition of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (30 mL), and the mixture extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 30 mL). The combined organic phases were washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (1 x 20 mL), dried (sodium sulfate), filtered, and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography (RediSep SiO2, 120 g column) on a CombiFlash Rf purification system eluting with ethyl acetate-hexanes (0-55%). The title compound (1.3342 g, 3.57 mmol, 92 % yield) was recovered as a colorless, very viscous oil. LC-MS [M+1] = 373.1.
