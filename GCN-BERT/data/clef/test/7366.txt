FIELD The present invention relates to games consoles, in particular to hand held controllers for games consoles. BACKGROUND Controllers for most current games consoles are generally intended to be held and operated by the user using both hands. A conventional controller will generally comprise a hard outer case with a plurality of controls mounted about the controller. Typically the controls include buttons, analogue control sticks, bumpers and triggers. An example of a conventional controller is shown in FIG. 1. As can be seen in FIG. 1, all of the controls are mounted on the front and top of the controller 1. Specifically, there are left and right analogue thumb sticks 2, 3 which normally control movement and are intended to be operated by the user's left and right thumbs respectively. There are four buttons 4, located on a front right portion of the controller 1, which normally control additional actions and are intended to be operated by the user's right thumb. There is a direction pad 5 located on the lower portion of the front left of the controller 1. The direction pad 5 is intended to be operated by the user's left thumb, typically either as an alternative to the left thumb stick 2 or to provide additional actions. A left trigger 6, a right trigger 7, a left bumper 8 and a right bumper 9 are located on the front edge of the controller 1. The left and right triggers 6, 7 are typically operated by a user's index fingers. The left and right bumpers 8, 9 may also be operated by a user's index fingers. The only way to operate the four buttons 4 is for a user to remove their right thumb from the right thumb stick 3. This takes time and, in some games, can cause the loss of control. This is a particular problem in games where the right thumb stick 3 is used for aiming. A similar problem may arise in games where the direction pad 5 provides additional actions and the user has to remove their thumb from the left thumb stick 2 in order to operate the direction pad 5. In light of the above, there is a need for an improved controller which removes the requirement for a user to remove their thumb from the left or right thumb stick 2, 3 in order to operate additional actions controlled by the four buttons 4 and/or the direction pad 5. The present invention seeks to overcome or at least mitigate the problems of the prior art.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The rear of a games controller 10 according to the present invention is illustrated in FIGS. 2 to 6. The front of the games controller 10 of FIGS. 2 to 6 is the same as a conventional controller 1, as illustrated in FIG. 1 and as discussed above. Therefore, where appropriate, the same reference numerals have been used to indicate the features of the controller according to the present invention 10 that are identical to the features of a conventional controller 1. The games controller 10 of the present invention differs from the conventional controller 1 in that it additionally comprises four paddle levers 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D located on the rear of the controller. The paddle levers 11A, 11B are substantially orientated in parallel with respect to a first handle portion H1 of the controller 10 and are positioned to be operated by the middle, ring or little fingers of a user 12, as shown in FIG. 6. The paddle levers 11C, 11D are substantially orientated in parallel with respect to a second handle portion H2 of the controller 10 and are positioned to be operated by the middle, ring or little fingers of a user 12, as shown in FIG. 6. In one embodiment the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D are formed from a thin, flexible material such as a plastics material, for example polyethylene. Preferably, the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D are less than 10 mm thick, but may be less than 5 mm thick and more preferably are 3 mm thick or less. The paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D are inherently resilient, that is to say that they return to an unbiased position when not under load. A user may displace or depress either of the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D by engaging an outer surface thereof; such displacement causes the paddle 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D to activate a switch mechanism 348 as shown in FIGS. 19 and 20 mounted within the body of the controller 10. The paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D are mounted between the first handle portion H1 and the second handle portion H2 located on the base of the controller 10, and are disposed in close proximity to the outer surface of the controller body. In the embodiment of FIG. 2, the paddles are fixed by a screw mechanism. A screw 15, having an external screw thread, is received in each of a pair of apertures provided in each of the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D. The apertures for receiving the screws are provided at one end of the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D; this is a fixed end. The other end of the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D is moveable. In this way, the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D can be bent or deformed temporarily. The inherent resilience of the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D returns the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D substantially to their starting position when released. The screws 15 are received in the base of the controller 10 in a respective aperture having an internal screw thread. It is envisaged that the internal screw thread may be pre-tapped into the base portion of the controller body, or may be created when driving the screws 15 into the base portion of the controller body, for example by using a self-tapping screw. It is also envisaged that the internal screw thread may be provided directly in the material forming the base portion of the controller body or may be provided in a separate insert or nut secured to, or in, the controller body. The base of the controller 10 is provided with four channels 13A, 13B, 13C, 13D, best shown in FIGS. 7 and 8. Each channel receives a respective one of the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D. In the illustrated embodiment the channels 13A, 13B, 13C, 13D are arranged to receive an end portion of the respective paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D. This is achieved by reducing the depth of the channels 13A, 13B, 13C, 13D towards one end to nothing, such that the channels 13A, 13B, 13C, 13D are tapered. This provides that one end of each of the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D stands proud of the base of the controller 10, best shown in FIG. 5. In this way a user can readily engage with the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D. The channels 13A, 13B, 13C, 13D provide stability to the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D. This increases the durability of the paddles and of the fixing means. The channels 13A, 13B, 13C, 13D reduce the likelihood of the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D rotating about the fixing end when engaging with the moveable end. The channels serve to restrict movement of the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D in a direction substantially perpendicular to the base of the controller, as indicated by direction arrow D1 in FIG. 5. In this way, a user may engage the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D with the tips of the fingers, preferably the middle fingers, without compromising their grip on the controller 10. However, it is envisaged that a user could use the ring or little finger. The index fingers may simultaneously engage trigger style controls mounted on the forward end of the controller 10 whilst the thumbs may be used to activate controls on the top of the controller 10. The paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D are elongate in shape and substantially extend in a direction from the front to the rear of the controller 10. In one embodiment, the paddles are orientated such that they converge towards the forward end with respect to one another; in an alternative embodiment, the paddles are orientated parallel with respect to one another. The elongate shape of the paddles allows a user to engage the paddles with any of the middle, ring or little fingers; it also provides that different users, having different sized hands, can engage with the paddles in a comfortable position, thereby reducing the effects of prolonged or repeated use such as repetitive strain injury. Each of the four paddle levers 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D can replicate the function of one of the four buttons 4 located on the front of the controller 10, and thereby allow a user to operate the functions of the relevant buttons using their middle fingers 12, without the need to remove either of their thumbs from the left or right thumb sticks 2, 3. In alternative embodiments, the paddle levers 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D may activate a new function not activated by the controls on the top of the controller 10. It is envisaged that the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D could be fitted to an existing controller 10. In such embodiments, the paddles would be mounted onto an outer surface of the controller body by means of a mechanical fixing such as a screw or bolt or, alternatively, bonded or welded to the controller body by adhesive or other suitable means. A switch mechanism would be mounted within the controller in vertical registry with a portion of each paddle. A portion of the switch mechanism may extend through the controller body and be disposed in close proximity to, or in contact with, an innermost surface of the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D. The handles H1, H2 comprise an inner surface S, as shown in FIG. 5. The inner surface S is engaged by the middle, ring and little fingers of a user's hands. The ring and little fingers are increasingly important for grip of the controller when the middle fingers are employed actuating the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D. The inner surface S of each of the handles H1, H2 meets a region of the base of the controller 10 upon which the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D are mounted. The inner surface S is inclined at a steep angle with respect to this region of the controller 10. This angle is equal to or greater than 45 degrees; optionally it may be between about 50 degrees to about 60 degrees. The handles H1, H2 have a substantially flat top portion T. The flat top portion T meets the inner surface S to define a corner or edge; the corner or edge is sharp, that is to say has a small radius of curvature. In this way the handles H1, H2 provide an ergonomic shape for being grasped by the ring and little fingers of a user's hands. Referring now to FIGS. 9 to 20, there are shown alternative embodiments of the present invention. In the further alternative illustrated embodiments like numerals have, where possible, been used to denote like parts, albeit with the addition of the prefix “100” or “200” or “300” and so on to indicate that these features belong to the second, third, fourth and so on embodiment respectively. The alternative embodiments share many common features with the first embodiment and therefore only the differences from the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 8 will be described in any greater detail. FIG. 9 illustrates a plan view from below of a rear body panel 114 of a controller 110. The rear body panel 114 comprises a manifold or cover portion 120. In the illustrated embodiment the cover portion 120 is secured to an external surface of the rear body panel 114 of the controller 110 by screws 115, although in other embodiments alternative fixing means are envisaged including, but not limited to, adhesive or mechanical interlocks. In alternative embodiments, the cover portion 120 may be secured to an internal surface of the rear body panel 114 of the controller 110. In such an embodiment, the rear body panel 114 of the controller 110 may comprise apertures through which the paddles levers 111A, 111B, 111C, 111D are inserted. In yet other embodiments, the cover portion 120 may be integrally formed or molded with the rear body panel 114 of a controller 110. The cover portion 120 comprises a first part 117A, 117B, 117C, 117D of a complementary locking means. The first part 117A, 117B, 117C, 117D of the complementary locking means takes the form of an aperture. The aperture is preferably rectangular in shape, although other shapes are envisaged. The cover portion 120 comprises five screw apertures 116 each for receiving a screw 115. The cover portion 120, when secured over the channels 113A, 113B, 113C, 113D defined in the rear body panel 114 of the controller 110, forms four closed channels or conduits 119A, 119B, 119C, 119D into which a respective one of the paddles 111A, 111B, 111C, 111D is inserted, best illustrated in FIGS. 11 and 12. The conduits 119A, 119B, 119C, 119D surround an end portion of the paddle levers 111A, 111B, 111C, 111D providing increased support to the paddle levers 111A, 111B, 111C, 111D. The paddle levers 111A, 111B, 111C, 111D are configured to be interchangeable or replaceable without the need to unscrew the fixing screws 115. The paddle levers 111A, 111B, 111C, 111D each comprise a second part 121A of a complementary locking means as shown in FIGS. 13 and 14. The second part 121A of the complementary locking means takes the form of a barb or catch and has an engaging edge 123A which interlocks with the aperture of first part 117A, 117B, 117C, 117D of the complementary locking means. The barb or catch is displaceable so as to be disengageable from the aperture by inserting a tool into the aperture and moving or pressing the barb or catch out of interlocking engagement with the aperture. Once the barb or catch has been sufficiently displaced the paddles 111A, 111B, 111C, 111D can be slid out of the conduit 119A, 119B, 119C, 119D. The paddles 111A, 111B, 111C, 111D can be inserted into the conduits 119A, 119B, 119C, 119D without the need for any tools. The paddles 111A, 111B, 111C, 111D can be pushed into the conduits 119A, 119B, 119C, 119D and in doing so the cover portion progressively engages with the barb or catch forcing it to be displaced within the paddles 111A, 111B, 111C, 111D. When the paddles 111A, 111B, 111C, 111D are inserted sufficiently that the barb or catch is aligned with the aperture, the inherent resilience of the barb or catch biases the barb or catch to return to its starting position such that the engaging edge of the barb or catch engages with an edge of the aperture thereby locking the paddles 111A, 111B, 111C, 111D within the conduits 119A, 119B, 119C, 119D. FIG. 15 illustrates a side view of a paddle 211A according to a third embodiment. The paddle 211A comprises a lug or projection 224A. The projection 224A projects outwardly from a first surface 225A of the paddle 211A. The first surface 225A of the paddle 211A opposes a second surface 225B of the paddle 211A from which the barb or catch 221A projects. The paddle 211A according to the third embodiment may be employed with the rear body panel 114 of the controller 110 and the cover portion 120 of the second embodiment. In an alternative embodiment, the barb or catch 221A may be omitted and replaced with one or more apertures for receiving a screw 115. In such an embodiment, the paddle lever may be employed with the rear body panel 114 of the controller 110 of the first embodiment. The lug or projection 224A provides an engaging surface 226A which is spaced from the first surface 225A of the paddle 211A. This lug or projection 224A is configured to be aligned with a switch mechanism 348, see FIG. 19. The engaging surface 226A is arranged to be disposed proximate the switch mechanism 348 such that when the paddle 211A is pressed, the engaging surface 226A contacts with the switch mechanism 348 and activates the switch mechanism 348. One advantage of providing the lug or projection 224A is that the switch mechanism 348 can be disposed in a recessed or flush position within the rear body panel 114 of the controller 110. There is no requirement for any part of the switch mechanism 348 to project from the rear body panel 114 of the controller 110. In this way, the switch mechanism 348 is protected when the paddle 211A is detached from the controller 110. This allows a user to configure the controller with a desired number of paddles in the available positions provided on the controller 110. When the number of paddles employed is less than the number of available positions, those switch mechanisms 348 in the vacant positions are protected by the rear body panel 114 of the controller 110. It also reduces the likelihood of a user accidentally or inadvertently activating a switch mechanism 348 in a vacant position. FIGS. 16 to 18 show a back panel 314 for a games controller 310. The back panel 314 has a trigger adjustment mechanism 354 for adjusting the start and/or stop positions of the triggers 306, 307. The rear panel 314 also comprises a charging indicator in the form of a Light Emitting Diode (LED). The rear panel 314 also comprises a remap device 344 in the form of an electronic circuit 346, best shown in FIG. 20, which includes an interface 342 or remap initiation device in the form of a remap switch to activate the remap device 344. The electronic circuit 346 also includes function switches having a switch mechanism 348 for replicating the function of one of the four buttons 4 located on the front of the controller 10, and thereby allowing a user to operate the functions of the relevant buttons using their middle fingers, without the need to remove either of their thumbs from the left or right thumb sticks 2, 3. In alternative embodiments, function switches 348 may activate a new function not activated by the controls on the top of the controller 10. The paddle levers 311A, 311B, 311C, 311D when pressed by the user engage with a respective one of the function switches 348, as illustrated in FIG. 19 to activate the respective function which has been programmed to correspond to that switch. The remap device 344 can be activated or programmed by a user whist the controller is in use, for example in game play, by simultaneously pressing, for a predefined time period, the desired paddle 311A, 311B, 311C, 311D, hence activating the respective function switch 348, the remap switch 342 and the desired button 4 which the paddle 311A, 311B, 311C, 311D is to replicate. Upon release of all of the desired paddle 311A, 311B, 311C, 311D, remap switch 342 and desired button 4, the remap device will have configured the selected paddle 311A, 311B, 311C, 311D to replicate the function of the selected button 4. This is advantageous because the function of any paddle 311A, 311B, 311C, 311D can be changed, by the user, in gameplay and provides an instant remapping function. The rear panel 314 also comprises a pair of over-grips 356. These over-grips 356 are separable from the rear panel 314. The handles H1, H2 can be customized by a user, for example to adjust the size, shape or appearance of the handles H1, H2. In this way, the user can select a particular design, appearance, theme or color scheme for their controller and may change this at will. It also provides a replaceable grip that can be renewed when worn or damaged. The user can select an over-grip 356 having dimensions to suit the particular size of their hand. This may help reduce fatigue or strain to the user's hands or wrists from repeated or prolonged use. The material of the over-grip 356 may be different to that of the rear panel 314. For example, the rear panel 314 may be formed from a rigid plastics material, whereas the over-grip 356 may be formed from a softer, flexible or deformable material which may provide greater comfort to the user. The over-grip 356 may be formed from a material which increases the friction between the user's hands and the controller. This may help to reduce the force the user needs to apply to grasp the controller and hence reduce the likelihood of strain injuries and mitigate against fatigue. Additionally or alternatively, the over-grips 356 provide increased stability of the controller in the hands of the user enabling more accurate use of the controls of the controller, in particular the thumb sticks 2, 3. FIGS. 21 to 24 illustrate a controller 410 according to a fifth embodiment. The controller 410 comprises four paddles 411A, 411B, 411C, 411D. The two outer paddles 411A, 411D are mounted substantially parallel to, or in substantially coplanar relationship with, the plane of the back panel 414. The two inner paddles 411B, 411C are mounted to the controller at an angle to the outer paddles 411A, 411D. In the illustrated embodiment, the two inner paddles 411B, 411C are mounted at an angle of approximately 45 degrees to the outer paddles 411A, 411D, although in other embodiments any angle between about 5 and 90 degrees is envisaged. The cover portion 420 is substantially “T” shaped when viewed in plan view from below, as shown in FIG. 21. The cover portion 420 comprises a central leg portion 421 disposed perpendicularly to the arm portions 422A, 422B. The inner paddles 411B, 411C are mounted on opposing sides of the central leg 421 of the cover portion 420. The central leg 421 includes function switches 448 mounted into each side wall 423A, 423B, as shown in FIG. 22. The controller 410 may employ the paddles 111A, 111B, 111C, 111D; 211A, 211B, 211C, 211D according to either the second embodiment (FIG. 9) or third embodiment (FIG. 15). In other embodiments the paddles 411A, 411B, 411C, 411D may be fixed to the cover portion 420 by screws 415 in similar fashion to the paddles 11A, 11B, 11C, 11D of the first embodiment. FIG. 25 illustrates a controller 510 according to a sixth embodiment. The controller 510 comprises four paddles 511A, 511B, 511C, 511D. The two outer paddles 511A, 511D are mounted substantially parallel to, or in a substantially coplanar relationship with, the plane of the back panel 514. The two inner paddles 511B, 511C are mounted to the controller at an angle to the outer paddles 511A, 511D. In the illustrated embodiment the two inner paddles 511B, 511C are mounted at an angle of approximately 45 degrees to the outer paddles 511A, 511D, although in other embodiments any angle between about 5 and 90 degrees is envisaged. The cover portion 520 has been integrally formed or molded with the rear panel 514. The paddles 511A, 511B, 511C, 511D are inserted into conduits or tunnels formed within the back panel 514. The conduits or tunnels may be formed in part from the back panel 514 and in part by an internal cover portion (not shown) secured to an inner surface of the back panel 514. The paddle arrangement of the fourth and fifth embodiment is advantageous since a user may engage the inner paddles 411B, 411C; 511B, 511C and the outer paddles 411A, 411D; 511A, 511D with the same finger, the distance the user must move their finger between the outer paddle 411A, 411D; 511A, 511D and the adjacent inner paddle 411B, 411C; 511B, 511C is reduced. In some embodiments, the user may not need to disengage their finger from the outer paddle 411A, 411D; 511A, 511D to engage the adjacent inner paddle 411B, 411C; 511B, 511C. The user may slide or roll their finger over the outer paddle 411A, 411D; 511A, 511D to engage the inner paddle 411B, 411C; 511B, 511C and activate the respective function switch 448, whilst maintaining contact with the adjacent outer paddle 411A, 411D; 511A, 511D. Referring now to FIGS. 26 to 41C, there are shown further alternative embodiments of the present invention. In the further alternative illustrated embodiments, like numerals have, where possible, been used to denote like parts, albeit with the addition of the prefix “600”, “700”, “800” and so on to indicate that these features belong to the sixth, seventh, eighth, and so on embodiment respectively. FIGS. 26 to 28 illustrate a controller 610 according to a sixth embodiment. The controller 610 comprises two paddles 611A, 611B. The two paddles 611A, 611B are mounted substantially parallel to the plane of the back panel 614. The controller 610 comprises a mounting plate or saddle 650 for mounting the two paddles 611A, 611B to the back panel 614 of the controller 610.
