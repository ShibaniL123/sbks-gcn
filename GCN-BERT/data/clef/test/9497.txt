The present invention relates to a process for the post-treatment of a zeolitic material having a MWW framework structure comprising X2O3 and YO2, wherein a zeolitic material having a MWW framework structure is provided and then subjected to a treatment with a liquid solvent system followed by a treatment with a liquid aqueous system. Further, the present invention relates to a zeolitic material obtained or obtainable by this process. Also, the present invention relates to the use of said zeolitic material, in particular as a catalyst precursor. Zeolites are widely used in the chemical industry, for example as heterogeneous catalysts for various chemical and petrochemical processes. Generally, zeolites are crystalline alumosilicates having microporous structure. Their special properties, among others, are attributed to their porous structure, usually a regular pore system of molecular dimensions, and their specific chemical composition. There are many known zeolites structures, either naturally occuring zeolites or synthesized zeolites, which can be applied as heterogeneous catalysts for many types of applications. In order to modify the properties of zeolitic materials such as their structure or their composition, post-treatment methods can be applied. The most common post-treatment methods described in the literature are steam treatments, acid treatments, or basic treatments. Steam treatment is often used to enhance the activity and stability of the zeolite for various selective reactions. EP 0 013 433 A1, for example, teaches the use of steam treatment to increase the activity of a zeolite by increasing the Si/Al ratio. This steam treatment not only influences the Si/Al ratio, but also has an impact on the acidic/basic properties and the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the zeolite. Acid treatment may have a similar effect, and it may also result in the change of the framework composition. For example, WO 02/057181 A2 describes the deboronation of a silicate wherein an acid is employed for the deboronation stage. According to the specific examples of this document, glacial acetic acid is employed, and according to conceivable embodiments which are not further concretized, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, oxalic acid, and tartaric acid are described. WO 2009/016153 A2 describes a combination of steam treatment and acid treatment. According to this document, phosphorus-modified molecular sieves are subjected to a steam treatment at high temperatures before a leaching step with an acidic solution is carried out to remove Al from the zeolitic material. Both the steam treatment and the acid treatment may have a significant influence on the properties of the zeolitic material. By subjecting a zeolitic material comprising both trivalent and tetravalent structural components X and Y as X2O3 and YO2, respectively, to a steam treatment and/or an acid treatment, the molar ratio X2O3:YO2 is decreased. However, it was found that also the crystallinity of the zeolitic materials is decreased by the steam treatment and/or acid treatment, and further, that the hydrophobicity of the zeolitic materials respectively decreases. Therefore, both the steam treatment and the acid treatment may result in a partial transformation of the crystalline material into an amorphous material. Thus, it was an object of the present invention to provide a process for the post-treatment of a zeolitic material which does not exhibit said disadvantage. Further, it was an object of the present invention to provide a post-treated zeolitic material having a low molar ratio X2O3:YO2 and simultaneously a high crystallinity. It was surprisingly found that a post-treatment process which includes subjecting a zeolitic material to a treatment with a liquid solvent system to decrease the molar ratio X2O3: YO2 followed by a treatment with a liquid aqueous system having a pH in the range of 5.5 to 8 at elevated temperatures of at least 75° C. avoids that disadvantages. Therefore, the present invention relates to a process for the post-treatment of a zeolitic material having an MWW framework structure, the process comprising (i) providing a zeolitic material having an MWW framework structure, wherein the framework structure of the zeolitic material comprises X2O3 and YO2, wherein Y is a tetravalent element and X is a trivalent element and wherein the molar ratio X2O3:YO2 is greater than 0.02:1; (ii) treating the zeolitic material provided in (i) with a liquid solvent system thereby obtaining a zeolitic material having a molar ratio X2O3:YO2 of at most 0.02:1, and at least partially separating the zeolitic material from the liquid solvent system; (iii) treating the zeolitic material obtained from (ii) with a liquid aqueous system having a pH in the range of from 5.5 to 8 and a temperature of at least 75° C.; wherein the pH of the aqueous system used in (iii) is determined using a pH sensitive glass electrode. Step (i) According to the present invention, X2O3 and YO2 comprised in the MWW framework structure of the zeolitic material provided in (i) are contained therein as structure building elements, in contrast to non-framework elements which can be present in the pores and cavities formed by the framework structure. Generally, there are no specific restrictions how the zeolitic material having an MWW framework structure is provided in (i). For example, it may be conceivable to purchase a suitable, commercially available zeolitic material having an MWW framework structure. Further, for example, any conceivable process for synthesizing such a zeolite can be employed for providing the zeolitic material. Preferably, the zeolitic material is provided in (i) by a process including hydrothermally synthesizing the zeolitic material starting from suitable sources of X2O3 and YO2 in the presence of a suitable template compound, also referred to as structure directing agent.

More preferably, Y is selected from the group consisting of Si, Ti, Sn, Zr, Ge, and combinations of two or more thereof.

These methods include, for example, filtration, ultra-filtration, diafiltration and centrifugation methods or, for instance, spray drying processes and spray granulation processes. A combination of two or more of these methods can be applied.

The reaction conditions according to (ii) are not specifically restricted, provided that the solvent system described above is in its liquid state and that the molar ratio X2O3:YO2 is decreased to a value of at most 0.02:1. In particular, concerning the preferred temperatures described below, the skilled person will choose the respective pressure under which the treating is carried out in order to keep the solvent system in its liquid state. Concerning the duration of the treating according to (ii), no specific restrictions exist.

Thus, the preferred vessel, representing an open system, used for the treating according to (ii) is preferably equipped with a reflux condenser. During (ii), the temperature of the liquid solvent system is kept essentially constant or changed, the treating with the liquid solvent system thus being carried out at two or more different temperatures. Most preferably, the temperature is kept essentially constant within the above-defined ranges.

Most preferably, the zeolitic material having an MWW framework structure is suspended in the liquid solvent system at a first stirring rate, and during the treating at above-described temperatures, the stirring rate is changed, preferably increased. The stirring rates as such can be suitably chosen depending, for example, on the volume of the liquid solvent system, the amount of the zeolitic material employed, the desired temperature, and the like.

As to the individual treating steps according to (ii) and the conditions applied, full reference is made to the conditions as described above. Concerning the treating time, the sum of the treating times of the individual steps are to be understood as the treating time described above. For each of the at least 2 individual treating steps, the same or different treating conditions can be applied. Therefore, the present invention relates to above-defined process and zeolitic material obtainable or obtained therefrom, wherein the treating according to (ii) is carried out in at least 2 separate steps, wherein between at least 2 treating steps, the zeolitic material is dried, preferably at a temperature in the range of from 100 to 150° C. Suitable drying atmospheres include technical nitrogen, air, or lean air.

According to the present invention, the treatment according to (ii) with the liquid solvent system reduces the molar ratio X2O3:YO2 of the zeolitic material framework; thus, it is a procedure for at least partially removing X from the MWW framework structure. Therefore, the molar ratio X2O3:YO2 of the zeolitic material having an MWW framework structure obtained from (ii) is higher than the molar ratio X2O3:YO2 of the zeolitic material having an MWW framework structure provided in (i). According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the molar ratio X2O3:YO2 obtained in (ii) is at most 0.02:1, preferably in the range of from 0.001:1 to 0.01:1, more preferably from 0.001:1 to 0.005:1, more preferably from 0.001:1 to 0.003:1. Therefore, according to an especially preferred embodiment of the invention, a zeolitic material having an MWW framework structure is obtained from (ii) which has a molar ratio B2O3:SiO2 of at most 0.02:1, preferably at most 0.01:1, more preferably in the range of from 0.001:1 to 0.01:1, more preferably from 0.001:1 to 0.005:1, more preferably from 0.001:1 to 0.003:1.

Step (iii) After (ii), the zeolitic material having an MWW framework structure, preferably the separated and dried zeolitic material having an MWW framework structure is subjected to a treatment with a liquid aqueous system having a pH in the range of 5.5 to 8 and a temperature of at least 75° C.

Generally, the amount of water contained in the liquid aqueous system is at least 85 weight-%, preferably at least 90 weight-%, more preferably at least 95 weight-%, more preferably, at least 99 weight-%, even more preferably at least 99.9 weight-%. Even more preferably, the liquid aqueous system used in (iii) essentially consists of water, and may only contain certain impurities which are contained in the water, preferably contained in the preferably used deionized water. Thus, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, in (iii), the liquid aqueous system comprises at least 90 weight-%, preferably at least 99 weight-%, more preferably at least 99.9 weight-% water. Concerning the pH of the aqueous system used in (iii), a pH in the range of from 5.5 to 8 is preferred. The pH of the liquid aqueous system is determined using a pH sensitive glass electrode. According to a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, the liquid aqueous system used in (iii) has a pH in the range of from 6 to 7.5, preferably from 6.5 to 7.5.

Further, no particular restrictions exist concerning the temperature of the liquid aqueous system, provided that the aqueous system is in its liquid state. Therefore, concerning the preferred temperatures described below, the skilled person will choose the respective pressure under which the treating according to (ii) is carried out in order to keep the solvent system in its liquid state. Preferably, in (iii), the zeolitic material is treated with the liquid aqueous system at a temperature in the range of from 75 to 200° C., preferably from 90 to 180° C., more preferably from 100 to 160° C., more preferably from 110 to 160° C., more preferably from 110 to 150° C. While concerning the type of vessel in which heating in (iii) is conducted, no particular restrictions exist, the vessel is suitably selected to allow to treat the zeolitic material at the temperatures described above, at which temperatures the aqueous system is in its liquid state. Therefore, as far as higher temperatures are concerned, the treatment according to (iii) is carried out in a closed system under autogenous pressure. According to a conceivable embodiment of the present invention, heating in (iii) is conducted in an open system. In this case, the reaction conditions are restricted by the temperature as the treating is carried out below the boiling temperature of the employed aqueous system in order to keep the aqueous system in its liquid state. According to a preferred embodiment, heating in (iii) is conducted in a closed system. Thus, heating in (iii) is preferably conducted under solvothermal conditions, meaning that the zeolitic material is treated with the liquid aqueous system under autogenous pressure of the liquid aqueous system, for example in an autoclave or other vessels suited for generating solvothermal conditions. Therefore, according to a particular preferred embodiment of the present invention, in (iii), the zeolitic material is treated with the liquid aqueous system in a closed system, preferably an autoclave, under autogenous pressure.

Further preferably, the process of the present invention does not comprise a treatment of the zeolitic material with an aqueous solution having a pH below 5.5 or above 8, neither prior to, nor during, nor after (iii).

The present invention is illustrated by the following examples. EXAMPLES Reference Example 1: Determination of the Water Uptake Water adsorption/desorption isotherms were performed on a VTI SA instrument from TA Instruments following a step-isotherm program. The experiment consisted of a run or a series of runs performed on a sample material that has been placed on the microbalance pan inside of the instrument. Before the measurement was started, the residual moisture of the sample was removed by heating the sample to 100° C. (heat-ing ramp of 5° C./min) and holding it for 6 h under a nitrogen flow. After the drying program, the temperature in the cell was decreased to 25° C. and kept constant during the measurement. The microbalance was calibrated, and the weight of the dried sample was balanced (maximum mass deviation 0.01 weight-%). Water uptake of a sample was measured as the increase in weight compared to the dry sample. First, an adsorption curve was measured by increasing the relative humidity (RH) (expressed as weight-% water in the atmosphere inside of the cell) to which the sample was exposed and measuring the water uptake by the sample as equilibrium. The RH was increased with a step of 10% from 5% to 85% and at each step the system controlled the RH and monitored the weight of the sample until reaching the equilibrium conditions after the sample and recording the weight uptake. The total adsorbed water of the sample was taken after the sample was exposed to the 85 weight-% RH. During the desorption measurement, the RH was decreased from 85 weight-% to 5 weight-% with a step of 10% and the change in the weight of the sample (water uptake) was monitored and recorded. Reference Example 2: Determination of the Crystallinity The crystallinity of the zeolitic materials according to the present invention was determined by XRD analysis, wherein the crystallinity of a given material is expressed relative to a reference zeolitic material wherein the reflecting surfaces of the two zeolitic materials are compared. The reference zeolitic material was zeolite ammonium beta powder commercially available under the CAS registry number 1318-02-1. The determinations of the crystallinities were performed on a D8 Advance series 2 diffractometer from Bruker AXS. The diffractometer was configured with an opening of the divergence aperture of 0.1° and a Lynxeye detector. The samples as well as the reference zeolitic material were measured in the range from 19° to 25° (2 Theta). After baseline correction, the reflecting surfaces were determined by making use of the evaluation software EVA (from Bruker AXS). The ratios of the reflecting surfaces are given as percentage values. Reference Example 3: 29Si-NMR Measurements All 29Si solid-state NMR experiments were performed using a Bruker Avance spectrometer with 300 MHz 1H Larmor frequency (Bruker Biospin, Germany). Samples were packed in 7 mm ZrO2 rotors, and measured less than 5 kHz Magic Angle Spinning at room temperature. 29Si direct polarization spectra were obtained using (pi/2)-pulse excitation with 5 microseconds pulse with a 29Si carrier frequency corresponding to −65 ppm in the spectrum, and a scan recycle delay of 120 s. Signal was acquired for 25 ms under 45 kHz high-power proton decoupling, and accumulated over 10 to 17 h. Spectra were processed using Bruker Topspin with 30 Hz exponential line broadening manual phasing and manual baseline correction over the entire spectrum. Spectra were referenced with the polymer Q8M8 as an external secondary standard, setting the resonance of the trimethylsilyl group to 12.5 ppm. The spectra were then fitted with a set of Gaussian line shapes, according to the number of discernable resonances. Fitting was performed using DMFit (Massiot et al., Magnetic Resonance in Chemistry, 40 (2002), pp 70-76). Peaks were manually set at the visible peak maxima or shoulder. Both peak position and line width were then left unrestrained, i.e., fit peaks were not fixed at a certain position. The fitting result was numerically stable, i.e., distortions in the initial fit setup as described above led to similar results. The fitted peak areas were further used normalized as performed by DMFit. Reference Example 4: IR Measurements The IR measurements were performed on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer. The zeolitic materials were pressed into a self-supporting pellet without the use of any additives. The pellet was introduced into a high vacuum cell placed into the IR instrument. Prior to the measurement the sample was pretreated in high vacuum (10−5 mbar) for 3 h at 300° C. The spectra were collected after cooling the cell to 50° C. The spectra were recorded in the range of 4000 cm−1 to 800 cm−1 at a resolution of 2 cm−1. The obtained spectra were represented by a plot having on the x axis the wavenumber (cm−1) and on the y axis the absorbance (arbitrary units). For the quantitative determination of the peak heights and the ratio between the peaks a baseline correction was carried out. Changes in the 3000 to 3900 cm−1 region were analyzed and for comparing multiple samples, the band at 1800±5 cm−1 was taken as reference. Example 1: Process According to the Invention (i) Providing a Starting Material (Zeolitic Material of Framework Structure MWW) 480 kg de-ionized water were provided in a vessel. Under stirring at 70 rpm (rounds per minute), 166 kg boric acid were suspended in the water at room temperature. The suspension was stirred for another 3 h at room temperature. Subsequently, 278 kg piperidine were added, and the mixture was stirred for another hour. To the resulting solution, 400 kg Ludox® AS-40 were added, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 70 rpm for another hour at room temperature. The finally obtained mixture was transferred to a crystallization vessel and heated to 170° C. within 5 h under autogenous pressure and under stirring (50 rpm). The temperature of 170° C. was kept essentially constant for 120 h. During these 120 h, the mixture was stirred at 50 rpm. Subsequently, the mixture was cooled to a temperature of from 50-60° C. The aqueous suspension containing B-MWW had a pH of 11.3 as determined via measurement with a pH-sensitive electrode. From said suspension, the B-MWW was separated by filtration. The filter cake was then washed with de-ionized water at room temperature until the washing water had a conductivity of less than 700 microSiemens/cm. The thus obtained filter cake was admixed with water to obtain a suspension having a solid content of 15 weight-%. This suspension was subjected to spray-drying in a spray-tower with the following spray-drying conditions: drying gas, nozzle gas: technical nitrogen temperature drying gas: temperature spray tower (in): 235° C.temperature spray tower (out): 140° C. nozzle:top-component nozzle supplier Gerig; size 0nozzle gas temperature: room temperaturenozzle gas pressure: 1 bar operation mode: nitrogen straight apparatus used: spray tower with one nozzle configuration: spray tower-filter-scrubber gas flow: 1,500 kg/h filter material: Nomex® needle-felt 20 m2 dosage via flexible tube pump: SP VF 15 (supplier: Verder) The spray tower was comprised of a vertically arranged cylinder having a length of 2,650 mm, a diameter of 1,200 mm, which cylinder was conically narrowed at the bottom. The length of the conus was 600 mm. At the head of the cylinder, the atomizing means (a two-component nozzle) were arranged. The spray-dried material was separated from the drying gas in a filter downstream of the spray tower, and the drying gas was then passed through a scrubber. The suspension was passed through the inner opening of the nozzle, and the nozzle gas was passed through the ring-shaped slit encircling the opening. The spray-dried material was then subjected to calcination at 600° C. for 10 h. The calcined material had a molar ratio B2O3:SiO2 molar ratio of 0.06 and a crystallinity of 74%, determined according to Reference Example 2. (ii) Treatment with a Liquid Solvent System—Deboronation 9 kg of de-ionized water and 600 g of the spay-dried material obtained according to Example 1 (i) were refluxed at 100° C. under stirring at 250 r.p.m. for 10 h. The resulting deboronated zeolitic material was separated from the suspension by filtration and washed with 8 l deionized water at room temperature. After the filtration, the filter cake was dried at a temperature of 120° C. for 16 h. The dried zeolitic material having an MWW framework structure had a B2O3:SiO2 molar ratio of 0.0022, a water uptake of 12%, determined according to Reference Example 1, and a crystallinity of 77%, determined according to Reference Example 2.

The suspension was stirred for 10 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the suspension was heated at 140° C. under autogenous pressure for 12 h in an autoclave. The resulting zeolitic material was separated from the suspension by filtration and washed with deionized water. After the filtration, the filter cake was dried at a temperature of 120° C. for 16 h. The dried zeolitic material was then subjected to calcination. The zeolitic material was heated to 450° C. within 5.5 h and heated at this temperature for 2 h. The calcined material had a B2O3:SiO2 molar ratio of 0.0015, a crystallinity of 83% and a water uptake of 8.9 weight-%. Results of Example 1 According to the present invention, a combination of a deboronation procedure using a liquid solvent system (water) with a treatment with a liquid aqueous system (water) was carried out. This combination, on the one hand, led to a zeolitic material having an MWW framework structure with a molar ratio B2O3:SiO2 which decreases from of 0.06:1 to 0.0015:1, and on the other hand, allowed to increase the crystallinity from 74% (or 77% after deboronation) to 83%. Moreover, the water uptake of the zeolitic material which characterizes the hydrophobicity of the zeolitic material and, thus, an important chemical parameter of the zeolitic material, did not change significantly (12 weight-% for starting material, 8.9 weight-% of the product). Example 2: Process According to the Invention (iii) Treatment with a Liquid Aqueous System 1600 g de-ionized water were provided in a vessel and 80 g of the deboronated zeolitic material obtained according to Example 1 (ii) having a B2O3:SiO2 molar ratio of 0.002, crystallinity of 77% and a water uptake of 12 weight-% were added under stirring. The suspension was stirred for 10 min. Thereafter, the suspension was heated at 140° C. under autogenous pressure for 12 h in an autoclave. The resulting zeolitic material was separated from the suspension by filtration and washed with deionized water. After the filtration, the filter cake was dried at a temperature of 120° C. for 10 h. The dried zeolitic material was then subjected to calcination. For calcination, the zeolitic material was heated to 450° C. within 5.5 h and kept at this temperature for 2 h. The calcined material had a B2O3:SiO2 molar ratio of 0.0023:1, a crystallinity of 87% and a water uptake of 9.3 weight-%. Results of Example 2 As Example 1, also Example 2 shows that the inventive process leads to a zeolitic material having an MWW framework structure with a molar ratio B2O3:SiO2 which decreases from of 0.06:1 to 0.0021:1, and simultaneously allows to increase the crystallinity from 74% (or 77% after deboronation) to 87%. Moreover, the water uptake of the zeolitic material which characterizes the hydrophobicity of the zeolitic material and, thus, an important chemical parameter of the zeolitic material, did not change significantly (12 weight-% for starting material, 9.3 weight-% of the product). Example 3: Process According to the Invention (iii) Treatment with a Liquid Aqueous System 1600 g de-ionized water were provided in a vessel and 80 g of the deboronated zeolitic material obtained according to Example 2 (ii) having a B2O3:SiO2 molar ratio of 0.002, crystallinity of 77% and a water uptake of 12 weight-% were added under stirring (200 rpm). The suspension was stirred for 10 min. Thereafter, the suspension was heated at 140° C. under autogenous pressure for 14 h in an autoclave. The resulting zeolitic material was separated from the suspension by filtration and washed with deionized water. After the filtration, the filter cake was dried at a temperature of 120° C. for 10 h. The dried zeolitic material was then subjected to calcination. The zeolitic material was heated to 450° C. within 5.5 h and heated at this temperature for 2 h. The calcined material had a B2O3:SiO2 molar ratio of 0.0008 a crystallinity of 85% and a water uptake of 10.7 weight-%. Results of Example 3 As Examples 1 and 2, also Example 3, carried out for 14 h under autogenous pressure, shows that a combination of a deboronation procedure using a liquid solvent system (water) with a treatment with a liquid aqueous system (water) according to the invention, leads to a zeolitic material having an MWW framework structure with a molar ratio B2O3:SiO2 which decreases from of 0.06:1 to 0.0008:1, and simultaneously allows to increase the crystallinity from 74% (or 77% after deboronation) to 85%. Moreover, the water uptake of the zeolitic material which characterizes the hydrophobicity of the zeolitic material and, thus, an important chemical parameter of the zeolitic material, did not change significantly (12 weight-% for starting material, 10.7 weight-% of the product). Comparative Example 1: Steam Treatment A shallow bed sample of 100 g deboronated zeolitic material obtained according to Example 2 (ii) having a B2O3:SiO2 molar ratio of 0.0022, a crystallinity of 77% and a water uptake of 12 weight-% was provided in a muffle oven and heated to 650° C. (temperature ramp 5 K/min). For the steam-treatment, a gas flow of 6 L/min (10% steam in air) was used, wherein the water dosing started at a temperature of 200° C. The steam-treatment was carried out for 1 h at 650° C. The obtained material had a B2O3:SiO2 molar ratio of 0.0026, a crystallinity of 74% and a water uptake of 9.7 weight-%. The multipoint BET specific surface area determined via nitrogen adsorption at 77 K according to DIN 66131 was 413 m2/g. Thus, steaming the deboronated zeolitic material according to the prior art carried out for decreasing the B2O3:SiO2 molar leads to a decrease in crystallinity, contrary to the process of the present invention which allows to keep the crystallinity constant of even increase the crystallinity. Comparative Example 2: Steam Treatment A shallow bed sample of 100 g deboronated zeolitic material obtained according to Example 2 (ii) having a B2O3:SiO2 molar ratio of 0.0022, crystallinity of 77% and a water uptake of 12 weight-% was provided in a muffle oven and heated to 850° C. (temperature ramp 5° C./min). For the steam-treatment, a gas flow of 6 L/min (10% steam in air) was used, wherein the water dosing started at 200° C. The steam-treatment was carried out for 1 h at 850° C. The obtained material had a B2O3:SiO2 molar ratio of 0.0027, a crystallinity of 54 and a water uptake of 7.5 weight-%. The multipoint BET specific surface area determined via nitrogen adsorption at 77 K according to DIN 66131 was 397 m2/g.
