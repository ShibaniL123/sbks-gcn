CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/000,711 filed May 20, 2014, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH This invention was made with government support under Grant HHSN268201000043C awarded by the National Institutes of Health and Grant CBET-0939511 awarded by the National Science Foundation. The government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the United States. The majority of fatalities are due to coronary artery disease and correlating heart failure. (Roger et al., 2012, Circulation, 125(1):e2-e220). Although the only therapeutic option for end-stage heart failure is full heart transplantation, the number of donor hearts available and the difficulties in matching patients to donors severely limits the success and viability of full organ transplantation. (Bu et al., 2009, Nature, 460(7251):113-117). Therefore, therapeutic alternatives are needed. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) including both embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Takahashi et al., 2007, Cell, 131(5):861-872; Park et al., 2008, Cell, 134(5):877-886) are a source of cells for cardiac repair (Zwi et al., 2009, Circulation, 120(15):1513-1523). CMs differentiated from both of these PSC types have cardiomyogenic potential. (Kattman et al., 2011, Cell Stem Cell, 8(2):228-240) (Burridge et al., 2012, Cell Stem Cell, 10(1):16-28). Moreover, PSC-derived CMs exhibit spontaneous contractile activity and cardiac-type mechanisms of excitation-contraction coupling, and expression of expected sarcomeric proteins, ion channels, and transcription factors (Mignone et al., 2010, Circ J, 74(12):2517-2526). Several recent pre-clinical studies have shown that transplantation of PSC derived CMs into rodent infarct models helped preserve cardiac function. (Yuasa et al., 2005, Nat Biotechnol, 23(5):607-611; Nemir et al., 2006, Circ Res, 98(12):1471-1478; Mummery et al., 2003, Circulation, 107(21):2733-2740; Passier et al., 2005, Stem Cells, 23(6):772-780). Engraftment of delivered CMs into heart is low and their survival rate is poor. Particularly, direct injection of cells alone is hampered by survival of only 50% of cells immediately after injection, and only 10% survival of the remaining cells after 1 week. (Müller-Ehmsen et al., 2002, J Mol Cell Cardiol, 34(2):107-116; Zhang et al., 2001, J Mol Cell Cardiol, 33(5):907-921). The longest reported survival of hPSC-CM after direct injection into murine myocardium is 12 weeks. (van Laake et al., 2008, Circ Res, 102(9):1008-1010). Thus, there is a need to develop methods to support retaining the cells in a localized manner and to promote cell viability, differentiation, maturation and integration with the host myocardium by providing the cells with a nurturing environment that protects and regulates the behaviors of the cells. (Itescu, et al., 2003, J Mol Med (Berl), 81(5):288-296; Dowell et al., 2003, Cardiovasc Res, 58(2):336-350; Rubart et al., 2004, J Clin Invest, 114(6):775-783).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Before the present disclosure is described in greater detail, it is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to particular embodiments described, and as such may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present disclosure will be limited only by the appended claims. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs. Although any methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can also be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, the preferred methods and materials are now described.

Further, the dates of publication provided could be different from the actual publication dates that may need to be independently confirmed. As will be apparent to those of skill in the art upon reading this disclosure, each of the individual embodiments described and illustrated herein has discrete components and features which may be readily separated from or combined with the features of any of the other several embodiments without departing from the scope or spirit of the present disclosure. Any recited method can be carried out in the order of events recited or in any other order that is logically possible. Embodiments of the present disclosure will employ, unless otherwise indicated, techniques of medicine, organic chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology, pharmacology, and the like, which are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature. It must be noted that, as used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. “Subject” refers any animal, preferably a human patient, livestock, or domestic pet. The terms “protein” and “polypeptide” refer to compounds comprising amino acids joined via peptide bonds and are used interchangeably Amino acids may be naturally or non-naturally occurring. A “variant” refers to a chemically similar sequence because of amino acid changes or chemical derivative thereof. In certain embodiments, a variant contains one, two, or more amino acid deletions or substitutions. In certain embodiments, the substitutions are conserved substitutions. In certain embodiments, a variant contains one, two, or ten or more an amino acid additions. The variant may be substituted with one or more chemical substituents. One type of conservative amino acid substitutions refers to the interchangeability of residues having similar side chains. For example, a group of amino acids having aliphatic side chains is glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine; a group of amino acids having aliphatic-hydroxyl side chains is serine and threonine; a group of amino acids having amide-containing side chains is asparagine and glutamine; a group of amino acids having aromatic side chains is phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan; a group of amino acids having basic side chains is lysine, arginine, and histidine; and a group of amino acids having sulfur-containing side chains is cysteine and methionine. Preferred conservative amino acids substitution groups are: valine-leucine-isoleucine, phenylalanine-tyrosine, lysine-arginine, alanine-valine, and asparagine-glutamine. More rarely, a variant may have “non-conservative” changes (e.g., replacement of a glycine with a tryptophan). Similar minor variations may also include amino acid deletions or insertions (in other words, additions), or both. Guidance in determining which and how many amino acid residues may be substituted, inserted or deleted without abolishing biological activity may be found using computer programs well known in the art, for example, DNAStar software. Variants can be tested in functional assays. Certain variants have less than 10%, and preferably less than 5%, and still more preferably less than 2% changes (whether substitutions, deletions, and so on). As used herein, the term “derivative” refers to a structurally similar compound that retains sufficient functional attributes of the identified analogue. The derivative may be structurally similar because it is lacking one or more atoms, substituted, multiply substituted, a salt, in different hydration/oxidation states, or because one or more atoms within the molecule are switched, such as, but not limited to, replacing an oxygen atom with a sulfur atom or replacing an amino group with a hydroxyl group and vice-versa. Derivatives may be prepare by any variety of synthetic methods or appropriate adaptations presented in synthetic or organic chemistry text books, such as those provide in March's Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms, and Structure, Wiley, 6th Edition (2007) Michael B.

Substituents may be further substituted or multiply substituted. As used herein, the terms “prevent” and “preventing” include the prevention of the recurrence, spread or onset. It is not intended that the present disclosure be limited to complete prevention. In some embodiments, the onset is delayed, or the severity of the disease is reduced. As used herein, the terms “treat” and “treating” are not limited to the case where the subject (e.g. patient) is cured and the disease is eradicated. Rather, embodiments, of the present disclosure also contemplate treatment that merely reduces symptoms, and/or delays disease progression.

Preferred salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, and the like. Enhanced Engraftment of Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived Cardiomyocytes Encapsulated in Injectable Nanomatrix Gel The potential success of stem cell-based therapy for cardiac regeneration has been consistently hindered by a critical inability to retain implanted cells in heart. In most stem cell studies, myocardially injected cells have a very low survival rate. Thus, various natural and artificial biomaterials have been assessed for cardiac repair with adult or pluripotent stem cells. Cell adhesive ligand Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) was incorporated into the peptide sequence of a peptide amphiphile (PA), i.e., PA-RGDS is [CH3(CH2)14CONH-GTAGLIGQ-RGDS] (SEQ ID NO: 1). Matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) degradable sequence Gly-Thr-Ala-Gly-Leu-Ile-Gly-Gln (GTAGLIGQ) (SEQ ID NO:2) was also incorporated to provide an enzyme degradable site. RGD is a α1β5 integrin binding cell adhesive ligand found in ECM proteins such as fibronectin and laminin and promotes cell adhesion and viability. A second PA without bioactive cell adhesive ligand, PA-S (C16-GTAGLIGQS)(SEQ ID NO: 17) was also synthesized to provide mechanical strength to the PA gels. Studies were performed to test whether inclusion of RGD sequence, MMP-2 degradable sites, and self-assembly into nanofibers under physiological conditions provide the nanomatrix with ECM mimicking characteristics. Whether the PA-RGDS is safe and biocompatible against CMs and if PA-RGDS can improve the cardiac repair by enhancing structural integration between transplanted mESC-derived CMs and host myocardium was tested. While the cardiac function of the mESC-CM-only injected group was improved to a similar extent to the mESC-CMs encapsulated with PA-RGDS group by 2 weeks after treatment, suggesting regenerative effects of bare mESC-CMs at an early phase, such effects disappeared after 3 weeks. Histologic examination demonstrated that the mESC-CM-only injected group showed virtually complete disappearance of the injected cells over 14 weeks. However, the PA-RGDS-encapsulated mESC-CM group showed long-term cellular engraftment and integration into host myocardium, expressed mature and structural CM proteins such as cTNT and MHC6/7, formed gap junctions with host CMs, and maintained improved cardiac function, indicating the effectiveness of PA-RGDS on the function of injected mESC-CMs. These results indicate that even though the gels may degrade by week 6, the cells delivered by the gels show significant long-term favorable outcomes. PA-RGDS indeed provides the cells with a protective environment during the early stage of implantation, which is critical for cell engraftment and survival, leading to improved retention and eventual interactions with host tissue. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) including both embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and the induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are useful for generating new CMs in injured hearts, with PA-RGDS, which addresses low cell survival. The PA-RGDS provides a protective microenvironment for CMs in vivo. An important aspect of the PA-RGDS is the physical properties of the gels, which can be tuned to provide mechanical strength. The mechanical properties of PA-RGDS self-assembled under conditions determined by the storage modulus (G′) have been observed to be around 100 Pa, which puts them in the category of moderately stiff hydrogels with higher potential for cell encapsulation and delivery for soft tissue engineering applications such as cardiovascular tissues. PA-RGDS nanomatrix gels were also observed to be structurally stable with well-defined cylindrical shape and increased durability for handling and transport. This is particularly important for early cell survival, as cardiac tissue scaffolds require enough mechanical strength to resist the cardiac cycle, but enough flexibility to allow the contractile function of implanted CMs. The mechanical strength of PA-RGDS can be tuned for the application. Peptide Amphiphile The term “peptide amphiphile” as used herein refers to a peptide-based molecule that comprises both a hydrophobic domain and hydrophilic domain. In certain embodiments, the peptide amphiphile has the capability to self-assemble into a three-dimensional network. In certain embodiments, the peptide amphiphiles can self-assemble into a three-dimensional structure that closely mimics the extracellular matrix that surrounds cells in native tissues. In certain embodiments, the peptide amphiphile can provide a protective microenvironment while simultaneously promoting localized extracellular matrix formation and intercellular connections in transplanted cells. In certain embodiments, the peptide amphiphile can promote cardiac regeneration. In certain embodiments, the hydrophobic domain is comprised of a peptide chain wherein the amino acids that comprise said peptide chain have hydrophobic properties. In certain embodiments, the hydrophobic domain is comprised of a hydrocarbon chain. In certain embodiments, the hydrocarbon chain contains between 2 and 20 carbon molecules. In the preferred embodiment, the hydrocarbon chain contains 16-18 carbon molecules or derivatives. In certain embodiments, the hydrophilic domain is comprised of a peptide chain wherein the amino acids that comprise said peptide chain have hydrophilic properties. In certain embodiments the hydrophilic peptide chain contains a cell adhesion ligand binding sequence. Examples cell adhesive sequences include, but not limited to, the amino acid sequences DGEA (SEQ ID NO: 3), YIGSR (SEQ ID NO: 4), IKVAV (SEQ ID NO: 5), ERGDS (SEQ ID NO: 6). In certain embodiments, the hydrophilic peptide chain contains an integrin binding cell adhesive ligand sequence. Examples of integrin binding cell adhesive ligand sequences include, but are not limited to, KQAGDV (SEQ ID NO: 7), LDV (SEQ ID NO: 8), IDS (SEQ ID NO: 9), RLD (SEQ ID NO: 10), KRLDS (SEQ ID NO: 11), LET (SEQ ID NO: 12) IET (SEQ ID NO: 13), YYGDLR (SEQ ID NO: 14) FYFDLR (SEQ ID NO: 15) (Ruoslahti et al., 1996, Annu Rev Cell Dev Biol, 12: 697-715). In certain embodiments, the hydrophilic peptide chain contains an α1β5 integrin binding cell adhesive ligand. In certain embodiments, the hydrophilic peptide chain has the amino acid sequence RGD (SEQ ID NO: 16). In certain embodiments, the peptide amphiphile comprises a second hydrophilic peptide sequence. In certain embodiments the second hydrophilic peptide sequence, is an enzyme mediated degradable site. In certain embodiments, the second hydrophilic peptide sequence is a matrix metalloprotease-2 (MMP-2) degradable sequence. In certain embodiments, the second hydrophilic peptide sequence has the amino acid sequence GTAGLIGQ (SEQ ID NO: 2). In certain embodiments, the second hydrophilic peptide sequence allows progressive degradation of the peptide amphiphile scaffold and replacement by natural extracellular matrix produced by the cells. Compositions of Cardiac Cells and Cardiac Precursor Cells Studies have shown that cell cultures directed toward differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into cardiomyocytes include three types of cardiomyocytes: nodal, atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes. Each type of cardiomyocyte has a unique functional, structural and electrophysiological characteristic, and ventricular cardiomyocytes have been shown desirable for cardiac repair. In certain embodiments, it may be desirable to separate ventricular cardiomyocytes from a general pool of cardiomyocytes which would contain nodal, atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes. In certain embodiments, the cardiac precursor cells are human embryonic stem cells which typically express Oct-4, Nanog, Sox2, Nin28, and Dnmt3b. In certain embodiments, the cardiac precursor cells are mesoderm cells which typically express BryT, FoxC1 and Dkk-1. In certain embodiments, the cardiac precursor cells are pre-cardiac mesoderm cells that express Mesp-1, Isl-1, and Flk-1. In certain embodiments, the cardiac precursor cells are cardiac progenitor cells that express Nkx2.5, Tbx5/20, Gata-4, Mef2c, and Hand1/2. In certain embodiments, the cardiac precursor cells are early cardiomyocytes that express cTnT, alpha-actin(c), MHC, MLC2a/v, and Pln. In certain embodiments, cardiac cells are cells made by the process of producing human ESCs embryoid bodies by a hanging-drop or forced-aggregation, e.g., spinning, allowing for spontaneous differentiation followed by culturing with cardiac inducing growth factors and/or hormones such as activin A, BMP-4, bFGF, Wnt3a, VEGF, DKK1, and combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, cardiac cells are cells made by the process of co-culturing human ESCs embryoid body cells with cardiomyocytes or division arrested cardiac cells, e.g., human or mouse division arrested END-2 cells. In certain embodiments, the culture medium may contain a P38 MAPK inhibitor and prostaglandin 12 (PG 12). In certain embodiments, ventricular cardiomyocytes are isolated using molecular beacon based sorting technique. See Ban et al., Circulation, 2013, 128: 1897-1909 and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 14/211,430. Molecular beacon (MB) technology is a method of sorting cells based on mRNA sequences. MBs are 20-30 base pair (bp) oligonucleotide probes with a fluorophore conjugated to the 5′ end and a quencher at the 3′ end. (Heyduk T & Heyduk E, 2002 Nat Biotech, 20:171-176). MBs are designed with 4-7 bps at the 5′ end which are complementary to the bps at the 3′ end. This self-complementary configuration induces the oligonucleotides to form a stem-loop (hairpin) structure so that the fluorophore and the quencher are within close proximity (<7 nm) and fluorescence is quenched. Hybridization of the MBs with the target mRNA opens the hairpin structure and physically separates the fluorophore from the quencher, allowing a fluorescence signal to be emitted upon excitation. (Tsourkas et al., 2002, Nucleic acids research, 30:4208-4215). MB technology may be used to separate and purify specific cell populations for example specific subpopulations of cardiac cells.

Peptide Amphiphile Synthesis Two peptide amphiphiles, C16-GTAGLIGQRGDS (PA-RGDS) and C16-GTAGLIGQS (PA-S), were synthesized via Fmoc-chemistry using an Aapptech Apex 396 peptide synthesizer. The peptides were then alkylated at the N-termini via two 12 h reactions with palmitic acid and a mixture of o-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate and diisopropylethylamine dissolved in dimethylformamide. This was succeeded by cleavage from the resin and deprotection for 3 h, using a 40:1:1:1 cocktail of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), deionized water, triisopropylsilane, and anisole. The collected samples were subjected to rotary evaporation to remove excess TFA, precipitated in ether, and lyophilized. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was utilized to confirm successful synthesis of PAs. Self-Assembly of Peptide Amphiphile Gels Stock solutions of PA-RGDS and PA-S [2% (weight/volume)] were individually prepared, and their respective pH was adjusted to 7 using sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The two PAs were then mixed in 1:1 molar ratio, and self-assembly into three-dimensional hydrogels was induced by combining 50 μL of PA solution with a mixture containing 15 μL of 0.1 M CaCl2 and 25 μL of cell suspension. The molar ratio of PA and Ca2+ was held constant at 2. Enrichment of mESC-Derived Cardiomyocytes Using Lactate To enrich the CMs from mESC differentiation cultures, lactate-based purification was applied. The cardiomyogenically differentiated mESCs at day 11 were dissociated with trypsin (0.05%), replated in fibronectin-coated dishes containing freshly prepared glucose-free advanced DMEM (no glucose, no pyruvate; Invitrogen) supplemented with 1 mM lactate, 0% FBS, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% 1-glutamine, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and continuously cultured for 7 days. Medium was changed every 2 days in order to eliminate dead cells. After 7 days of culture in lactase-containing media, the enriched mESC-derived CMs were dissociated with trypsin (0.05%), transferred to fibronectin-coated dishes, and further cultured with α-MEM supplemented with 3% FBS and ITS. To quantify the CMs, flow cytometric analysis following cell permeabilization was performed using ACTN2 antibody (Sigma). Induction of Myocardial Infarction and Cardiomyocyte Transplantation Myocardial infarction (MI) was induced in mice by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery, and cells or other reagents were intramyocardially injected through 30 G needles at two different sites in the border zone of the myocardium immediately after surgery. Mice were randomly assigned into four treatment groups: (i) PBS as a control group, (ii) 2×105 mESCs-derived CMs only, (iii) PA-RGDS only, or (iv) 2×105 mESCs-derived CMs encapsulated with PA-RGDS. Due to the limiting factor of murine heart size and the requirement to deliver a large quantity of cells, only one concentration ratio of PA (2×105 mESCs-derived CMs) to cells was used for the studies. All CMs were obtained from the same differentiation batch and prelabeled with CM-DiI (red fluorescence) before cell injection for cell tracking in histology. Assessment of Cardiomyocyte Stability after Encapsulation with PA-RGDS To examine the compatibility of the PA-RGDS as a scaffold to encapsulate CMs and the cellular response of CMS against PA-RGDS, live/dead staining was performed against CM/PA-RGDS constructs which were harvested after 7 days of cultivation in normal CM culture condition. A majority of RNVCMs encapsulated with PA-RGDS were alive even after 7 days of culture and very few dead cells were present indicating that PA-RGDS minimally affected the viability of the CMs over 7-day culture period (Live: 90.7±6.2% vs. Dead: 9.3±0.8%, respectively, FIG. 2). Investigation of Cytoprotective Effects of PA-RGDS Encapsulation Against Simulating Ischemic Injury Model In Vitro Since oxidative stress in the ischemic heart is increasingly recognized as a possible cause for poor survival of transplanted cells, whether encapsulation of the CMs with PA-RGDS increases their survival when exposed to the H2O2 simulating ischemic condition in vitro was investigated. The results from live/dead staining demonstrated that encapsulation of RNVCMs with PA-RGDS significantly improved CM viability as substantially higher percentage of live CMs were detected in CM/PA-RGDS constructs in compared to bare CMs control group (Live: CM/PA-RGDS: 81.7±9.3% vs.CM only: 6.1±0.4%; Dead: CM/PA-RGDS: 17.7±2.3% vs.CM only: 86.1±7.7%; FIG. 3A). Similarly, CM/PA-RGDS constructs exposed to H2O2 released a significantly lower level of LDH in comparison to CM only group (CM/PA-RGDS: 0.14±0.05 arbitrary units (AUs) vs. CM only: 0.61±0.07 AU; FIG. 3B), indicating that encapsulating the CMs with PA-RGDS is capable of improving CM survival against H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Increased Retention of Transplanted Cardiomyocyte Through PA-RGDS To investigate the effects of PA-RGDS on CM engraftment and survival in vivo, cultured HL-1 CMs were pre-labeled with CM-DiI, a red fluorescent dye, and injected into the hearts of athymic nude mice (2×105 cells per mouse) in the absence or presence of PA-RGDS. For more accurate quantification of these engrafted/survived cells, flow cytometry analysis was performed with enzymatically digested heart tissues after 7 days of injection (FIG. 4). Approximately 4% of DiI positive HL-1 CMs were detected in the mouse heart tissues by flow cytometry after 7 days of injection. Of interest, injection of HL-1 CMs with PA-RGDS significantly improved (˜3 folds) the rate of engraftment/survival of HL-1 CMs (CM/PA-RGDS: 11.7±1.2% vs. CM only: 4.4±0.5%). Furthermore, the results from immunohistochemistry with Actn2 (or α-sarcomeric actinin) antibody revealed that the significant numbers of DiI positive CMs expressing cardiac specific protein Actn2 from the heart tissues were observed 7 days after injection of CMs when they were injected with PA-RGDS. The results from both flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry strongly indicated that implementation of PA-RGDS greatly increased the retention rate of the injected CMs into the hearts in vivo. Generation and Purification of Cardiomyocytes from Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells CMs were generated from mESCs by establishing an embryoid body (EB)-mediated CM differentiation system (FIG. 5A). Undifferentiated mouse ESCs (J1) maintained on STO feeder cells were enzymatically detached to form EBs. Subsequently, day 4 EBs were plated into a fibronectin-coated dish for further CM differentiation. Spontaneously beating clumps began to appear 3-4 days after the plating of EBs on the monolayer cultures in the presence of ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml). After 7 days of CM differentiation process, the culture condition was modified to glucose-depleted media supplemented with 1 mM lactate in order to enrich mESC-derived CMs. This lactate-based CM purification was continued for 7 days. To further characterize these enriched mESC-derived CMs through lactate based purification method, we carried out both intracellular flow cytometry analysis using Tnnt2 antibody and immunocytochemistry. The results from intracellular flow cytometry analysis showed that the percentage of Tnnt2 positive cells were 79.9±4.5% (FIG. 5B). In addition, the immunocytochemistry results demonstrated that almost all of CMs-derived mESCs highly expressed CM specific proteins such as Actn2, Tnnt2, and Myh6/7 confirming their CM nature. Collectively, these results indicated that CMs were successfully generated and enriched through our CM differentiation and purification system. CM/PA-RGDS Improved Cardiac Function and Reduced Scar Formation after MI Next, the therapeutic effects of treatments with CM only, PA-RGDS only and mESC-CMs with PA-RGDS, comparing with PBS control in ischemic myocardium in mice was investigated. Echocardiography was performed regularly to measure cardiac remodeling and function (FIG. 6A). One week post MI induction and treatment echocardiographic assessments of ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) did not differ significantly among the treatment groups. However, although differences did not reach statistical significance, both EF and FS of the two experimental groups (CM and CM+PA-RGDS) were higher than those of the PA-REDS only and PBS group from week 2. Of note, while the cardiac function in CM or PA-RGDS only groups was dramatically reduced between 3-4 weeks, cardiac function of the CM+PA-RGDS group was preserved and significantly greater than the cardiac functions of the three other groups until 4 weeks after MI induction (FIG. 6A). Masson's Trichrome staining was performed with fixed sections of infarcted hearts to evaluate the extent of scar formation 4 weeks after MI induction. Quantification of the scar areas showed that the treatment with encapsulated mESC-CM with PA-RGDS significantly reduced scar area (14.7±2.1%; N=6) compared to the treatment with other three experimental groups (PBS control: 44.2±5.1%; CM only: 32.4±2.6%; and PA-RGDS only: 41.7±4.7%; N=6) (FIG. 6B). Histological analyses exhibited that many clusters of DiI labelled CMs were identified within the peri-infarct and infarct regions in the heart tissues that received CMs with PA-RGDS after 4 weeks post treatment. In contrast, heart tissues that received CMs only had fewer numbers of DiI labelled CMs detected, CMs injected with PA-RGDS has substantially more number of DiI positive cells were observed (FIG. 6C). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry images of heart tissues harvested after 4 weeks post MI induction and treatment showed that intramyocardially injected CMs with PA-RGDS engrafted robustly in the myocardium, formed clusters, integrated into the host myocardium, and expressed representative CM proteins such as Tnnt2 and MHC6/7, indicating that the treatment of CMs with PA-RGDS markedly enhance cell retention and engraftment within the damaged myocardium. Sustained Therapeutic Effects of mESC-CMs with PA-RGDS Prior studies reported that the beneficial effects from treatment with various types of stem cells or stem cell derived cells were substantially diminished by 3-4 weeks, mostly due to massive cell death or ejection from the myocardium. Hence, the long-term therapeutic effects of CM/PA-RGDS treatment was continuously monitor in comparison with those of CM only injection group. Echocardiography data from a subset of mice that received CMs with PA-RGDS had sustained their improved cardiac function until week 12 compared with the data from the CM only injected group that showed progressive and marked decline in cardiac function. (FIG. 7A) Of note, substantial numbers of DiI positive CMs were still able to be identified in the heart tissues receiving CMs with PA-RGDS even after 14 weeks (FIG. 7B). In contrast, the heart tissues receiving CMs had only little number of DiI labeled CMs identified. Moreover, immunohistochemistry images of heart tissues harvested after 14 weeks post MI induction and treatment showed that intramyocardially injected CMs with PA-RGDS were survived well and structurally integrated into the host myocardium as determined by expressions of CM representative proteins such as Tnnt2 and MHC6/7, indicating that the treatment of CMs with PA-RGDS markedly enhance cell retention and engraftment within the damaged myocardium. 1.
