CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a continuation of prior application Ser. No. 13/586,821, filed Aug. 15, 2012. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure relates to a surgical instrument, and, more particularly, to a steerable laser probe. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A wide variety of ophthalmic procedures require a laser energy source. For example, ophthalmic surgeons may use laser photocoagulation to treat proliferative retinopathy. Proliferative retinopathy is a condition characterized by the development of abnormal blood vessels in the retina that grow into the vitreous humor. Ophthalmic surgeons may treat this condition by energizing a laser to cauterize portions of the retina to prevent the abnormal blood vessels from growing and hemorrhaging. In order to increase the chances of a successful laser photocoagulation procedure, it is important that a surgeon is able aim the laser at a plurality of targets within the eye, e.g., by guiding or moving the laser from a first target to a second target within the eye. It is also important that the surgeon is able to easily control a movement of the laser. For example, the surgeon must be able to easily direct a laser beam by steering the beam to a first position aimed at a first target, guide the laser beam from the first position to a second position aimed at a second target, and hold the laser beam in the second position. Accordingly, there is a need for a surgical laser probe that can be easily guided to a plurality of targets within the eye. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure provides a steerable laser probe. In one or more embodiments, a steerable laser probe may comprise a handle having a handle distal end and a handle proximal end, a housing sleeve, an optic fiber disposed in the housing sleeve, a shape memory sleeve disposed over a distal end of the optic fiber, and a light source interface configured to interface with a proximal end of the optic fiber. Illustratively, the shape memory sleeve may be configured to hold the distal end of the optic fiber at a prebent angle, e.g., 90 degrees, when the shape memory sleeve is not contained within the housing sleeve. In one or more embodiments, a compression of an actuation structure of the handle actuates the housing sleeve relative to the shape memory sleeve and the optic fiber wherein the housing sleeve is gradually extended over the shape memory sleeve and the optic fiber. Illustratively, the shape memory sleeve and the optic fiber are gradually straightened as the housing sleeve is gradually extended over the shape memory sleeve and the optic fiber. In one or more embodiments, a decompression of the actuation structure actuates the housing sleeve relative to the shape memory sleeve and the optic fiber wherein the housing sleeve is gradually retracted and the shape memory sleeve and the optic fiber are gradually exposed by the housing sleeve. Illustratively, the shape memory sleeve gradually curves the optic fiber as the shape memory sleeve and the optic fiber are gradually exposed by the housing sleeve. In one or more embodiments, a compression of an actuation structure of the handle actuates the optic fiber and the shape memory sleeve relative to the housing sleeve wherein the optic fiber and the shape memory sleeve are gradually extended from the housing sleeve. Illustratively, the shape memory sleeve and the optic fiber are gradually curved as the shape memory sleeve and the optic fiber are gradually extended from the shape memory sleeve. In one or more embodiments, a decompression of the actuation structure actuates the optic fiber and the shape memory sleeve relative to the housing sleeve wherein the optic fiber and the shape memory sleeve are gradually retracted into the housing sleeve. Illustratively, the housing sleeve gradually straightens the shape memory sleeve and the optic fiber as the shape memory sleeve and the optic fiber are gradually retracted into the housing sleeve. In one or more embodiments, a compression of an actuation structure of the handle actuates the optic fiber and the shape memory sleeve relative to the housing sleeve wherein the optic fiber and the shape memory sleeve are gradually retracted into the housing sleeve. Illustratively, the shape memory sleeve and the optic fiber are gradually straightened as the shape memory sleeve and the optic fiber are gradually retracted into the housing sleeve.

In one or more embodiments, a compression of an actuation structure of the handle actuates the housing sleeve relative to the optic fiber and the shape memory sleeve wherein the housing sleeve is gradually retracted to expose the optic fiber and the shape memory sleeve. Illustratively, the shape memory sleeve and the optic fiber are gradually curved as the shape memory sleeve and the optic fiber are gradually exposed by the housing sleeve. In one or more embodiments, a decompression of the actuation structure actuates the housing sleeve relative to the optic fiber and the shape memory sleeve wherein the housing sleeve is gradually extended over the shape memory sleeve and the optic fiber.

In one or more embodiments, shape memory sleeve 260 may be configured to gradually curve optic fiber 270, e.g., towards pre-bent angle 265, as shape memory sleeve 260 and optic fiber 270 are gradually exposed by housing sleeve 250.

Illustratively, straightened optic fiber 500 may be fully contained within housing sleeve 250. In one or more embodiments, optic fiber 270 and shape memory sleeve 260 may be fully contained within housing sleeve 250, e.g., when actuation structure 120 is fully compressed. For example, actuation mechanism distal end 221 may abut actuation mechanism distal interface 335, e.g., when optic fiber 270 comprises a straightened optic fiber 500. Illustratively, when optic fiber 270 and shape memory sleeve 260 are fully contained within housing sleeve 250, pre-bent angle 265 of shape memory sleeve 260 may be straightened by housing sleeve 250. For example, an angle between housing sleeve 250 and a line tangent to optic fiber distal end 271 may be, e.g., 180 degrees, when housing sleeve 250 contains a straightened optic fiber 500. FIG. 5B illustrates a partially curved optic fiber 510. In one or more embodiments, a decompression of a fully compressed actuation structure 120 may be configured to gradually retract housing sleeve 250, e.g., to expose optic fiber 270 and shape memory sleeve 260. Illustratively, as optic fiber 270 and shape memory sleeve 260 are gradually exposed by a retraction of housing sleeve 250, shape memory sleeve 260 may be configured to cause optic fiber 270 to gradually curve toward pre-bent angle 265. In one or more embodiments, a decompression of actuation structure 120 may be configured to cause a straightened optic fiber 500 to gradually curve to a partially curved optic fiber 510. Illustratively, a decompression of actuation structure 120 may be configured to gradually expose optic fiber 270 and shape memory sleeve 260 causing optic fiber 270 to gradually curve toward pre-bent angle 265. For example, as an exposed length of optic fiber 270 and shape memory sleeve 260 is increased, e.g., by a retraction of housing sleeve 250, an angle between housing sleeve 250 and a line tangent to optic fiber distal end 271 may be decreased. Illustratively, optic fiber 270 and shape memory sleeve 260 may be exposed from housing sleeve distal end 251 at a first exposed length with a first angle between housing sleeve 250 and a line tangent to optic fiber distal end 271. A refraction of housing sleeve 250, e.g., due to a decompression of actuation structure 120, may be configured to expose optic fiber 270 and shape memory sleeve 260 from housing sleeve distal end 251 at a second exposed length with a second angle between housing sleeve 250 and a line tangent to optic fiber distal end 271.

In one or more embodiments, a decompression of actuation structure 120 may be configured to cause a partially curved optic fiber 510 to gradually curve to a fully curved optic fiber 520. Illustratively, when housing sleeve 250 is retracted to expose a partially curved optic fiber 510, optic fiber 270 and shape memory sleeve 260 may be exposed from housing sleeve distal end 251 at a partially exposed length with a partially exposed angle between housing sleeve 250 and a line tangent to optic fiber distal end 271. A retraction of housing sleeve 250, e.g., due to a full decompression of actuation structure 120, may be configured to expose optic fiber 270 and shape memory sleeve 260 from housing sleeve distal end 251 at fully exposed length with a fully exposed angle between housing sleeve 250 and a line tangent to optic fiber distal end 271. For example, housing sleeve 250 may expose optic fiber 270 and shape memory sleeve 260 at a fully exposed length with a fully exposed angle between housing sleeve 250 and a line tangent to optic fiber distal end 271 when housing sleeve 250 is retracted to expose a fully curved optic fiber 520. Illustratively, the fully exposed length may be greater than the partially exposed length and the fully exposed angle may be less than the partially exposed angle. In one or more embodiments, one or more properties of a steerable laser probe may be adjusted to attain one or more desired steerable laser probe features. Illustratively, a position of fixation mechanism housing 150 and fixation mechanism 210 or a length of optic fiber 270 and shape memory sleeve 260 extending distally from a position of fixation mechanism 210 may be adjusted to vary an amount of decompression of actuation structure 120 configured to expose a particular length of optic fiber 270 and shape memory sleeve 260 from housing sleeve distal end 251.

In one or more embodiments, one or more properties of optic fiber 270 may be adjusted to attain one or more steerable laser probe features. For example, a portion of optic fiber 270 may be formed in a pre-bent angle. Illustratively, a portion of optic fiber 270 may be formed in a pre-bent angle by, e.g., heating the portion of optic fiber 270 to a temperature configured to weaken chemical bonds of the portion of optic fiber 270, molding the portion of optic fiber 270 in a pre-bent angle, and cooling the portion of optic fiber 270.

Illustratively, housing sleeve 250 may be configured to hold a pre-bent angle of optic fiber 270 in a straightened position, e.g., when optic fiber 270 is fully contained within housing sleeve 250. In one or more embodiments, a decompression of actuation structure 120 may be configured to retract housing sleeve 250 relative to optic fiber 270 causing optic fiber 270 to gradually curve towards the pre-bent angle as optic fiber 270 is gradually exposed by housing sleeve 250.

Illustratively, a surgeon may aim optic fiber distal end 271 at any of a plurality of targets within an eye, e.g., to perform a photocoagulation procedure. In one or more embodiments, a surgeon may aim optic fiber distal end 271 at any target within a particular transverse plane of the inner eye by, e.g., rotating handle 100 to orient shape memory sleeve 260 in an orientation configured to cause a curvature of optic fiber 270 within the particular transverse plane of the inner eye and varying an amount of compression of actuation structure 120.
