This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/847,159, filed Mar. 19, 2013, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/425,125, filed Apr. 16, 2009, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The present invention relates to the use of dronedarone or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for the preparation of a medicament for use in the prevention of cardiovascular hospitalization and/or of mortality. 2-n-Butyl-3-[4-(3-di-n-butylaminopropoxy)benzoyl]-5-methylsulphonamidobenzofuran, or dronedarone, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are described in European Patent EP 0 471 609 B1. Dronedarone blocks potassium, sodium and calcium channels and also has anti-adrenergic properties. Dronedarone is an anti-arrhythmic that is effective in maintaining sinus rhythm in patients presenting with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. The applicant has clinically proven that dronedarone significantly reduces cardiovascular hospitalizations and/or mortality in patients having a history of atrial fibrillation or of atrial flutter, by virtue of its ability to modulate the blood potassium level in a safe and effective way. In fact, the use of benzofuran derivatives to reduce post-infarction mortality in patients having a reduced left ventricular function after myocardial infarction, without any rhythm disorder requiring an anti-arrhythmic treatment, is known from Patent Applications WO 98/40067 and WO 97/34597. However, these applications neither disclose nor suggest the use of dronedarone to reduce cardiovascular hospitalizations and mortality in patients having a history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, in particular by virtue of its ability to modulate the potassium level in the blood. Potassium is the principal intracellular ion and plays an essential role in physiology. Specifically, this ion is the principal osmotically active intracellular ion and plays an important role in the regulation of intracellular volume. A constant and stable potassium concentration is essential for the function of enzyme systems and also for good growth and cell division. Potassium contributes to establishing the resting potential of the cell membrane and, consequently, changes in potassium concentration, in particular in the extracellular compartment, have effects on cell excitability in the nervous, muscle and cardiac system. A decrease in potassium concentration is known to increase cardiac hyperexcitability at the ventricular level, which can result in serious, potentially deadly, rhythm disorders. The deleterious role of a decrease in potassium concentration has been documented in disparate clinical situations. For example, in patients suffering from heart failure, the decrease in potassium concentration can lead to deadly rhythm disorders; diuretics having a “potassium sparing” effect have demonstrated a beneficial effect in this population. The rapid decrease in potassium concentrations occurring following the abrupt arrest of intense physical exercise could also be responsible for certain sudden deaths. A possible contribution of the decrease in potassium concentrations has been mentioned in the sudden death of patients treated with antipsychotics and also in acute alcohol withdrawal syndromes. Eating habits with a reduced potassium intake may lead to sudden death in predisposed individuals, even without any structural cardiac pathology. The risk of fatal cardiac hyperexcitability is particularly great in patients who receive an anti-arrhythmic treatment which prolongs the duration of cell repolarization, such as sotalol (Sotalex®). These agents may in fact induce a torsade de pointe, which is a severe and potentially deadly ventricular tachycardia. Torsades de pointes are facilitated by the decrease in potassium concentration. Finally, it has been shown that the decrease in potassium concentration induces atrial fibrillations (Manoach M., J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol., 1998, 30(6): A4[8]). Another clinical situation where the risk of potentially fatal cardiac rhythm disorders is high is represented by patients treated with diuretics, these medicaments, which are widely prescribed in many indications, the most common being arterial hypertension, but also heart failure, renal insufficiency, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis and glaucoma, expose the patient to the risk of a decrease in potassium concentration except for “potassium sparing” diuretics. A complication of the decrease in potassium concentration subsequent to treatment with diuretics may be sudden death, in particular in patients who present an impairment of the contractile function of the heart or left ventricular dysfunction or after a myocardial infarction. Regulation of the potassium concentration could therefore play an important beneficial role, in particular in the population of patients who require an anti-arrhythmic treatment (for atrial fibrillation) and who possibly have other risk factors. Now, no anti-arrhythmic, to date, in therapy, has shown effects with regard to the regulation of the potassium level in the blood. Atrial fibrillation (AF) affects about 2.3 million people in North America and 4.5 million people in the European Union and is emerging as a growing public health concern because of the aging of the population. AF is a condition in which the upper chambers of the heart beat in an uncoordinated and disorganized fashion, resulting in a very irregular and fast rhythm (i.e., an irregularly, irregular heartbeat). When blood is not completely pumped out of the heart's chambers, it can pool and clot. If a blood clot forms in the atria, exits the heart and blocks an artery in the brain, a stroke results. Consequently, about 15 percent of strokes result from AF. AF is increasingly frequent with advancing age and is often caused by age-related changes in the heart, physical or psychological stress, agents that stimulate the heart, such as caffeine, or as a result of cardiovascular disease. The number is expected to double in the next 20 years. Without appropriate management, AF can lead to serious complications, such as stroke and congestive heart failure. It is known that atrial fibrillation itself can cause changes in the electrical parameters of the heart known as electrical remodelling and in the structure of the cardiac chambers known as structural remodelling which tend to decrease the chances of the patient to get back into normal sinus rhythm. This vicious circle whereby “atrial fibrillation begets atrial fibrillation” has been well documented since the 1990s (Wijffels M C, Kirchhof C J, Dorland R, Allessie M A. Atrial fibrillation begets atrial fibrillation. A study in awake chronically instrumented goats. Circulation. 1995 Oct. 1; 92(7):1954-68). It explains why when patients have been in atrial fibrillation for a long time they develop permanent atrial fibrillation with little or no chance to recover from this arrhythmia which becomes chronic. A subject of the present invention is therefore the use of dronedarone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the preparation of a medicament, wherein said medicament is taken, for use in the prevention of cardiovascular hospitalizations and/or of mortality.

In terms of clinical study, the prevention of “cardiovascular hospitalizations or of mortality” or of “cardiovascular hospitalizations or of cardiovascular mortality” or of “cardiovascular hospitalizations or of sudden death” constitute what are referred to as composite criteria or a combined endpoint. All the percentages given above correspond to average values. Diuretics are widely prescribed for their efficacy in the treatment of a diversity of conditions, such as arterial hypertension, congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, nephrotic syndrome, cirrhosis or glaucoma. One of the major consequences of a treatment based on diuretics, except for potassium sparing diuretics, is increased potassium excretion which can result in hypokalaemia. Now, hypokalaemia is known to increase cardiac excitability, resulting, in certain patients, in ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death (Cooper et al., Circulation, 1999, 100, pages 1311-1315). Advantageously, a subject of the present invention is also the use of dronedarone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the preparation of a medicament for use in the prevention of cardiovascular hospitalizations and/or of mortality in patients having a history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and receiving a diuretic-based treatment, in particular a treatment based on non-potassium sparing diuretics. A subject of the present invention is also the use of dronedarone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the preparation of a medicament for regulating the potassium level in the blood, in particular for use in the prevention of hypokalaemia, especially in patients having histories of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and/or patients receiving a diuretic-based treatment, in particular a treatment based on non-potassium sparing diuretics. Said diuretic is administered at therapeutically active doses chosen between 1 mg/day and 2 g/day. Among the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of dronedarone, mention may be made of the hydrochloride. The term “non-potassium sparing diuretic” is intended to mean a diuretic which increases potassium excretion. The term “cardiovascular hospitalization” means a hospitalization which is caused by at least one of the following pathologies (Hohnloser et al., Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology, January 2008, vol. 19, No. 1, pages 69-73): relating to atherosclerosis,myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris,stable angina pectoris or atypical thoracic pain,syncope,transient ischemic event or cerebral stroke (except intracranial haemorrhage),atrial fibrillation and other supraventricular rhythm disorders,non-fatal cardiac arrest,ventricular arrhythmia,cardiovascular surgery, except heart transplant,heart transplant,implantation of a cardiac stimulator (pacemaker), of an implantable defibrillator (“ICD”) or of another cardiac device,percutaneous coronary, cerebrovascular or peripheral intervention,variations in arterial pressure (hypotension, hypertension, except syncope),cardiovascular infection,major bleeding/haemorrhage (requiring two or more blood cell pellets or any intracranial haemorrhage),pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis,worsening of congestive heart failure including acute pulmonary oedema or dyspnoea from cardiac causes. Consequently, the prevention of cardiovascular hospitalization may be understood as the prevention of cardiovascular hospitalization for at least one of the above mentioned pathologies. Mention may be made of the prevention of cardiovascular hospitalization for atrial fibrillation and/or other supraventricular rhythm disorders. Mention may also be made of the prevention of cardiovascular hospitalization for transient ischemic event or cerebral stroke. Thus, a subject of the present invention is also the use of dronedarone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, for the preparation of a medicament for the prevention of cardiovascular hospitalization for at least one of the above mentioned pathologies such as atrial fibrillation and/or other supraventricular rhythm disorders and/or stroke. The term “mortality” or “death” are equivalent and cover mortality due to any cause, whether cardiovascular or non-cardiovascular or unknown. The term “cardiovascular mortality” covers, in the context of the invention, mortality due to any cardiovascular causes (any death except those due to a non-cardiovascular cause), in particular death from an arrhythmic cause, also called arrhythmic death, and more particularly, sudden death from cardiovascular causes, also called sudden death or sudden cardiac death. Cardiovascular mortality may be due for example to: Aortic dissection/aneurysmCardiac tamponadeCardiogenic shockcongestive heart failureDeath during a cardiovascular transcutaneous interventional procedure or cardiovascular surgical interventionHemorrhage (except cardiac tamponade)Myocardial infarction or unstable angina (including complications of myocardial infarction, except arrhythmias)Pulmonary or peripheral embolismStrokeSudden cardiac death (eg, unwitnessed death or documented asystole)Ventricular arrhythmia, subclassified as torsades de pointes, ventricular extrasystole, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia (non-sustained and sustained ventricular tachycardia), or other ventricular arrhythmiaUnknown cause The term “sudden death” refers, in general, to death occurring within the hour or less than one hour after the appearance of new symptoms or unexpected death without warning. It will also be specified that the expression “patients having a history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter”, “patients with a history of or a current atrial fibrillation or flutter” or “patients with a recent history of or a current atrial fibrillation or flutter” or “patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation or flutter” or “patients with a history of, or a current paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation or flutter” or “patients with a recent history of, or a current paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation or flutter” or “patients with paroxysmal or intermittent atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and a recent episode of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, who are in sinus rhythm or who will be cardioverted” or “patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and a recent episode of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, who are in sinus rhythm or who will be cardioverted” means a patient who, in the past, has presented one or more episodes of atrial fibrillation or flutter and/or who is suffering from atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter at the time the dronedarone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is used. More particularly, this expression means patients with documentation of having been in both atrial fibrillation or flutter and sinus rhythm within the last 6 months preceding the start of treatment. Patients could be either in sinus rhythm, or in atrial fibrillation or flutter at the time the dronedarone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is initiated. It will also be specified that the terms “persistent” and “intermittent” are equivalent. Patients in “permanent atrial fibrillation or flutter” are patients that have all scheduled ECGs in this rhythm throughout the period the dronedarone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered. The term “coronary disease” or “coronary heart disease” refers to: 1) Coronary artery disease: documented history of acute myocardial infarction and/or significant (≧70%) coronary artery stenosis and/or history of a revascularization procedure (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, stent implantation in a coronary artery, coronary artery bypass graft, etc) and/or a positive exercise test and/or positive nuclear scan of cardiac perfusion2) Ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy: clinically significant left ventricular dilatation secondary to coronary artery disease Of course, it may be understood that “prevention of cardiovascular hospitalization and/or mortality” results in the reduction of the risk of cardiovascular hospitalization and or mortality or in the reduction of the need of cardiovascular hospitalization and or mortality. Among the patients with a recent history of, or a current atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, mention may be made of patients with a recent history of, or a current, non permanent atrial fibrillation or flutter. Among the patients, notably patients having a history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, mention may also be made of patients also exhibiting at least one of the following risk factors: age notably equal to or above 70, or even above 75,hypertension,diabetes,history of cerebral stroke or of systemic embolism, i.e. prior cerebrovascular accident,left atrial diameter greater than or equal to 50 mm measured for example by echocardiography,left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40%, measured for example by two-dimensional echography. The efficacy of dronedarone to reduce cardiovascular hospitalization or death is now clinically proven in patients with the above mentioned associated risk factors. The above mentioned risks factors may be defined as cardiovascular risk factors which are associated to atrial fibrillation. Among the patients, notably patients having a history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, mention may also be made of patients also exhibiting additional risk factors, i.e. at least one of the following pathologies: hypertension,underlying structural heart disease,tachycardia,coronary disease,non-rheumatic heart valve disease,dilated cardiomyopathy of ischemic origin,ablation of atrial fibrillation or flutter, for example catheter ablation or endomyocardial ablation,supraventricular tachycardia other than atrial fibrillation or flutter,history of heart valve surgery,non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy,hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,rheumatic valve disease,sustained ventricular tachycardia,congenital cardiopathy,ablation, for example catheter ablation, for tachycardia other than for atrial fibrillation or flutter,ventricular fibrillation, and/or at least one cardiac device chosen from: a cardiac stimulator,an implantable defibrillator (“ICD”). The expression “regulating the potassium level in the blood” means preventing the decrease or a possible increase in said level. The principal classes of non-potassium sparing diuretics are: thiazide diuretics,loop diuretics,proximal diuretics (osmotics, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors). For their therapeutic use, dronedarone and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof are generally introduced into pharmaceutical compositions. These pharmaceutical compositions contain an effective dose of dronedarone or of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and also at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Said pharmaceutical composition may be given once or twice a day with food. The dose of dronedarone administered per day, orally, may reach 800 mg, taken in one or more intakes, for example one or two. More specifically, the dose of dronedarone administered may be taken with food. More specifically, the dose of dronedarone administered per day, orally, may reach 800 mg, taken in two intakes with a meal. The dose of dronedarone administered per day, orally may be taken at a rate of twice a day with a meal for example with the morning and the evening meal. More specifically, the two intakes may comprise same quantity of dronedarone. There may be specific cases where higher or lower dosages are appropriate; such dosages do not depart from the context of the invention. According to the usual practice, the dosage appropriate for each patient is determined by the physician according to the method of administration, the weight, the pathology, the body surface, the cardiac output and the response of said patient. Said excipients are chosen according to the pharmaceutical form and the method of administration desired, from the usual excipients which are known to those skilled in the art. In said pharmaceutical compositions for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, topical, local, intratracheal, intranasal, transdermal or rectal administration, dronedarone, or the salt thereof, can be administered in unit administration form, as a mixture with conventional pharmaceutical excipients, to animals and to humans in the cases mentioned above. The suitable unit administration forms comprise forms for oral administration, such as tablets, soft or hard gel capsules, powders, granules and oral solutions or suspensions, sublingual, buccal, intratracheal, intraocular or intranasal administration forms, forms for administration by inhalation, topical, transdermal, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous administration forms, rectal administration forms, and implants. For topical application, dronedarone and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used in creams, gels, ointments or lotions. By way of example, a unit administration form of dronedarone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in tablet form, may correspond to one of the following examples: Ingredients mg % Dronedarone hydrochloride (corresponding to 426 65.5 400 mg of base) Methylhydroxypropylcellulose 21.1 3.25 Lactose monohydrate 46.55 7.2 Maize starch 45.5 7 Polyvinylpyrrolidone 65 10 Poloxamer 407 40 6.15 Anhydrous colloidal silica 2.6 0.4 Magnesium stearate 3.25 0.5 650 100 Ingredients mg % Dronedarone hydrochloride (corresponding to 400 mg 426 65.5 of base) Microcrystalline cellulose 65 10 Anhydrous colloidal silica 2.6 0.4 Anhydrous lactose 42.65 6.6 Polyvinylpyrrolidone 13 2 Poloxamer 407 40 6.15 Macrogol 6000 57.5 8.85 Magnesium stearate 3.25 0.5 650 100 Ingredients mg Dronedarone hydrochloride (corresponding to 400 mg of 426 base) Microcrystalline cellulose 26 Maize starch 45.5 Polyvinylpyrrolidone 65 Poloxamer 407 40 Anhydrous colloidal silica 3.25 Magnesium stearate 3.25 Lactose monohydrate 41.65 650 Ingredients mg Dronedarone hydrochloride (corresponding to 400 mg of 213 base) Microcrystalline cellulose 13 Maize starch 22.75 Polyvinylpyrrolidone 32.5 Poloxamer 407 20 Anhydrous colloidal silica 1.3 Magnesium stearate 1.625 Lactose monohydrate 20.825 650 According to another of its aspects, the present invention also relates to a method for treating the pathologies indicated above, which comprises the administration, to a patient, of an effective dose of dronedarone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

A calculated GFR at baseline <10 ml/min using the Cockroft Gault formula (GFR [ml/min]=(140−AGE [years]*WEIGHT [kilograms]*CONSTANT/CREATININE [μmol/L], where CONSTANT is 1 for men and 0.85 for women). Furthermore, the concomitant use of grapefruit juice and all potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ketoconazole were prohibited. II. DURATION AND TREATMENT Treatment was initiated using tablets containing either the placebo or an amount of dronedarone hydrochloride corresponding to 400 mg of dronedarone at a rate of twice a day with the morning and evening meal and more specifically at a rate of one tablet in the morning during or shortly after breakfast and one tablet in the evening during or shortly after dinner. The anticipated duration of the treatment was variable according to the time at which each patient was included in the study, and could range from a minimum of 12 months for the last patient included up to a maximum corresponding to the entire duration of the study (12 months+duration of inclusion), i.e. approximately 30 months for the first patients included. III. RESULTS The results obtained in this trial were analysed by the Kaplan Meier method for the figures, and the relative risk (RR) was estimated using Cox's proportional-effect regression model. The relative risk (RR) is the ratio of the rates of occurrence of a hospitalization or of a death among the patients on dronedarone, relative to the patients on placebo. The percentage reduction x of a given event (hospitalization, death, cardiovascular death, etc.) is calculated in the following way: [in-line-formulae]x=1−relative risk.[/in-line-formulae] III.1. Results Relating to Cardiovascular Hospitalizations and to Mortality (Principal Judgement Criterion) Among the 4628 patients included in the study, 2301 were part of the group treated with dronedarone hydrochloride. 917 events were recorded in the placebo group, against 734 in the group treated with dronedarone hydrochloride. The calculated relative risk is 0.758 with a p=2×10−8, i.e. a reduction in cardiovascular hospitalizations and deaths of 24.2% on dronedarone hydrochloride, the result being highly significant.

FIG. 7, which reproduces the results obtained, shows a clear separation of the two cumulative curves very soon after the beginning of the treatment, this separation persisting over time throughout the duration of the study. III.11. Regulation of the Blood Potassium Level The potassium concentration-modulating effect is clearly documented in the study by virtue of the results of analyses of regular blood samples taken throughout the duration of the study in the context of the monitoring of vital parameters. The variations in potassium (in mmol/1) between the first and the last administration of the medicament of the study are included in FIG. 8, in which B signifies basal level, D signifies day and M signifies month. An analysis of covariance of the change in blood potassium level, taking into account the starting value during the study after the 24th month, shows a significant different in favour of dronedarone compared to the placebo (p<0.0001). Dronedarone therefore makes it possible to regulate the potassium level in the blood. III.12. Results Relating to the Patients in the Study Receiving, in Addition, a Diuretic-Based Treatment The clinical results of the study corroborate the hypothesis that modulating potassium decreases the risk of sudden death, in particular in patients exposed to the risk of a decrease in potassium exacerbated by the administration of a diuretic treatment: the reduction in the risk of sudden death by dronedarone, i.e. the prevention of sudden death compared with the placebo, was 70.4% in the patients on diuretics and 34% in the patients not taking diuretics. Furthermore, the reduction in the risk was greater in the groups of patients liable to be treated with diuretics, such as hypertensive patients, where the reduction in the risk was 62%, against a reduction of 45.5% observed in the patients who were not hypertensive. III.13. Results Relating to Cardiovascular Hospitalizations and to Mortality in Patients Who Developed “Permanent Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter” Among the 4628 patients included in the study, 2301 were part of the group treated with dronedarone hydrochloride. 294 patients who developed permanent atrial fibrillation/flutter in the group treated with placebo versus 178 patients in the group treated with dronedarone hydrochloride (p<0.001). 74 events were recorded in the placebo group versus 29 in the group treated with dronedarone hydrochloride. The calculated relative risk is 0.67 with a p=0.06, i.e. a reduction in cardiovascular hospitalizations and to mortality in patients with permanent atrial fibrillation/flutter of 33% on dronedarone hydrochloride. FIG. 9, which reproduces the results obtained, shows a clear separation of the two cumulative curves very soon after the beginning of the treatment, this separation persisting over time throughout the duration of the study.
