Step 4:
5-(2-chloro-5-fluoropyrimidin-4-yl)-3-isopropyl-2-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2H-pyrazolo [4,3-c]pyridine
At 25°C, to a solution of 3-isopropyl-2-methyl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-c] pyridine (5.25 g, 20.75 mmol, 1.00 equivalent) in tetrahydrofuran (60.00 mL) were added 2,4-dichloro-5-fluoropyrimidine (3.50 g, 20.96 mmol, 1.01 equivalents) and triethylamine (9.51 g, 94.01 mmol, 4.53 equivalents). The reaction mixture was stirred for 18 hours. TLC (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate = 3: 1) showed completion of the reaction of the starting material. The reaction solution was diluted with water (200 mL) and subjected to extraction using methyl acetate (200 mL×2). The combined organic layers was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to give a crude product. The crude product was purified by column chromatography (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate = 5: 1 to 2: 1) to give the title compound (Intermediate E) (5.60 g, 18.08 mmol, 87.12% yield) as an off-white solid.
