Fluid Compositions for Improving Skin Conditions [01] This patent application claims priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to U. S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/313,664 filed March 12, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. [02] Dermal fillers are useful in soft tissue and dermal correction. One common polymer used in dermal filler compositions is hyaluronan, also known as hyaluronic acid (HA). Although exhibiting excellent biocompatibility and affinity for water molecules, in its natural state, hyaluronan exhibits poor biomechanical properties as a dermal filler. Tezel and Fredrickson, The Science of Hyaluronic Acid Dermal Fillers, J Cosmet Laser Ther. 10(1): 35-42 (2008); Kablik, et al., Comparative Physical Properties of Hyaluronic Acid Dermal Fillers, Dermatol Surg. 35 Suppl 1: 302-312 (2009); Beasley, et al., Hyaluronic Acid Fillers: A Comprehensive Review, Facial Plast Surg. 25(2): 86-94 (2009); each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. One primary reason is that this polymer is soluble and is cleared rapidly when administered into a skin region. Tezel, supra, 2008; Kablik, supra, 2009; Beasley, supra, 2009. This in vivo clearance is primarily achieved by degradation, principally enzymatic degradation via hyaluronidase and chemical degradation via free-radicals. To minimize the effect of these in vivo degradation pathways, matrix polymers like hyaluronan are crosslinked to one another to form a hydrogel. Because hydrogels are more solid substance that are readily soluble, dermal fillers comprising such crosslinked matrix polymers remain in place at the implant site. Tezel, supra, 2008; Kablik, supra, 2009; Beasley, supra, 2009. A crosslinked matrix polymer like hyaluronan is also more suitable as a component of a dermal filler because it’s more solid nature improves the mechanical properties of the filler, allowing the filler to better lift and fill a skin region. Tezel, supra, 2008; Kablik, supra, 2009; Beasley, supra, 2009. [03]Hyaluronan is abundant in the different layers of the skin, where it has multiple functions such as to ensure good hydration, assist in the organization of the collagen matrix, and act as a filler material assisting the organization of the extracellular matrix. However, with age, the quantity of hyaluronan present in the skin decreases. This lose of hyaluronan results in various skin conditions such as, e.g., skin dehydration, lack of skin elasticity, skin roughness, lack of skin tautness, skin stretch line and/or marks, skin paleness, skin wrinkles, and the like. As such, it would be desirable to have a skin -2- therapy that can replace the endogenous matrix polymers that are lost with age in order to treat these skin conditions. However, current dermal fillers comprising hydrogels of cross!inked matrix polymers like crosslinked hyaluronan cannot be used to replace the lost endogenous polymers because the crosslinking prevents the ability of these polymers to integrate into the extracellular matrix. However, as discussed above, although uncrosslinked matrix polymers like hyaluronan are soluble, and as such, could integrate into the extracellular matrix and replace lost endogenous hyaluronan, uncrosslinked matrix polymers are rapidly cleared from the body by in vivo degradation pathways. Thus, what is needed is a fluid composition comprising uncrosslinked matrix polymers that include an additional stabilizing component that reduces or prevents matrix polymer degradation. [04] The fluid compositions disclosed in the present specification achieve this goal. Such fluid compositions comprise a matrix polymer and a stabilizing component that reduces or 15 prevents in vivo degradation of the matrix polymer. Administration of the disclosed fluid compositions improves skin conditions such as, e.g., hydration and the cutaneous elasticity by compensating for the loss of the endogenous polymer. [04a] According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a dermal filler composition comprising: a) a hyaluronan polymer consisting essentially of uncrosslinked hyaluronic acid having a mean molecular weight of at least about 2,500,000 Da, the uncrosslinked hyaluronan polymer being at least 95% by weight of the total hyaluronan polymer present in the composition; and b) mannitol present in at about 0.5% (w/v) to about 5% (w/v) of the composition. [04b] According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided an injectable dermal filler composition for rehydrating skin, comprising: a) a hyaluronan polymer consisting essentially of hyaluronic acid having a mean molecular weight of at least about 2,500,000 Da, wherein the hyaluronan polymer is present at a concentration of about 11.5 mg/mL to about 15.5 mg/mL, and wherein the said polymer is essentially free of a crosslinked hyaluronan polymer; and b) mannitol present in at about 0.5% (w/v) to about 5% (w/v) of the composition. - 2a - [04c] According to a third aspect of the present invention there is provided a fluid composition comprising a) an uncrosslinked hyaluronan polymer consisting essentially of uncrosslinked hyaluronic acid having a mean molecular weight of at least about 2,500,000 Da, wherein the uncrosslinked hyaluronan polymer is present in the composition at a concentration of about 11.5 mg/mL to about 15.5 mg/mL; b) a crosslinked hyaluronan polymer; and c) a mannitol; wherein the mannitol is present in at most 5.0% (w/v) of the composition.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [011] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition comprising a matrix polymer and a stabilizing component. As used herein, the term “fluid” refers to a continuous, amorphous substance whose molecules move freely past one another. A fluid cannot sustain a shearing force when at rest and undergoes a continuous change in shape when subjected to such a force. It should be noted, that although the compositions disclosed in the present specification are fluid in nature due to the presence of uncross linked matrix polymers, such fluid compositions, may, although may not, include cross linked matrix polymers, which, by its nature, is a gel or other solid substance. As such, certain fluid compositions disclosed in the present specification exhibit viscoelastic properties. [012] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition comprising a matrix polymer.

The repeating unit consists of a hexose (six-carbon sugar) or a hexuronic acid, linked to a hexosamine (six-carbon sugar containing nitrogen) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Members of the GAG family vary in the type of hexosamine, hexose or hexuronic acid unit they contain, such as, e.g., glucuronic acid, iduronic acid, galactose, galactosamine, glucosamine) and may also vary in the geometry of the glycosidic linkage. Any glycosaminoglycan is useful in the compositions disclosed in the present specification with the proviso that the glycosaminoglycan improves a condition of the skin, such as, e.g., hydration or elasticity.

As used herein, the term “chondroitin sulfate” refers to an unbranched, sulfated GAG of variable length comprising disaccharides of two alternating monosaccharides of D-glucuronic acid (GIcA) and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. A chondroitin sulfate may also include D-glucuronic acid residues that are epimerized into L-iduronic acid (IdoA), in which case the resulting disaccharide is referred to as dermatan sulfate. A chondroitin sulfate polymer can have a chain of over 100 individual sugars, each of which can be sulfated in variable positions and quantities. Chondroitin sulfate is an important structural component of cartilage and provides much of its resistance to compression. Any chondroitin sulfate is useful in the compositions disclosed in the present specification with the proviso that the chondroitin sulfate improves a condition of the skin, such as, e.g., hydration or elasticity. Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of chondroitin sulfate include sodium chondroitin sulfate, potassium chondroitin sulfate, magnesium chondroitin sulfate, calcium chondroitin sulfate, and combinations thereof. [015] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition comprising a keratan sulfate. As used herein, the term “keratan sulfate” refers to a GAG of variable length comprising disaccharide units, which themselves include p-D-galactose and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Disaccharides within the repeating region of keratan sulfate may be fucosylated and Ν-Acetylneuraminic acid caps the end of the chains. Any keratan sulfate is useful in the compositions disclosed in the present specification with the proviso that the keratan sulfate improves a condition of the skin, such as, e.g., hydration or elasticity. Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of keratan sulfate include sodium keratan sulfate, potassium keratan sulfate, magnesium keratan sulfate, calcium keratan sulfate, and combinations thereof. [016] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition comprising a hyaluronan. As used herein, the term “hyaluronic acid” is synonymous with “HA”, “hyaluronic acid”, and “hyaluronate” refers to an anionic, non-sulfated glycosaminoglycan polymer comprising disaccharide units, which themselves include D-glucuronic acid and D-N-acetylglucosamine monomers, linked together via alternating β-1,4 and β-1,3 glycosidic bonds and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Hyaluronan can be purified from animal and non-animal sources. Polymers of hyaluronan can range in size from about 5,000 Da to about 20,000,000 Da. Any hyaluronan is useful in the compositions disclosed in the present specification with the proviso that the hyaluronan improves a condition of the skin, such as, e.g., hydration or elasticity. Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of hyaluronan include sodium hyaluronan, potassium hyaluronan, magnesium hyaluronan, calcium hyaluronan, and combinations thereof. [017] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition comprising a lubricin. As used herein, the term “lubricin” refers to a large, water soluble glycoprotein encoded by the PRG4 gene and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. It has a molecular weight of 206,000 Da and comprises approximately equal proportions of protein and glycosaminoglycans. The structure of lubricin molecule is that of a partially extended flexible rod and, in solution, occupies a smaller spatial domain than would be expected from structural predictions. This characteristic may aid in the molecule's boundary lubricating ability. Lubricin is present in synovial fluid and on the surface (superficial layer) of articular cartilage and therefore plays an important role in joint lubrication and synovial homeostasis. Any lubricin is useful in the compositions disclosed in the present specification with the proviso that the lubricin improves a condition of the skin, such as, e.g., hydration or elasticity. Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of lubricin include sodium lubricin, potassium lubricin, magnesium lubricin, calcium lubricin, and combinations thereof. [018] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition comprising a crosslinked matrix polymer. As sued herein, the term “crosslinked” refers to the intermolecular bonds joining the individual polymer molecules, or monomer chains, into a more stable structure like a gel. As such, a crosslinked matrix polymer has at least one intermolecular bond joining at least one individual polymer molecule to another one. Matrix polymers disclosed in the present specification may be crosslinked using dialdehydes and disufides crosslinking agents including, without limitation, divinyl sulfones, diglycidyl ethers, and bis-epoxides. Non-limiting examples of hyaluronan crosslinking agents include divinyl sulfone (DVS), 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether (BDDE), 1,2-bis(2,3-epoxypropoxy)ethylene (EGDGE), 1,2,7,8-diepoxyoctane (DEO), biscarbodiimide (BCDI), adipic dihydrazide (ADH), bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS), hexamethylenediamine (HMDA), 1-(2,3-epoxypropyl)-2,3-epoxycyclohexane, or combinations thereof. [019] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition comprising a crosslinked matrix polymer having a degree of crosslinking. As used herein, the term “degree of crosslinking” refers to the percentage of matrix polymer monomeric units that are bound to a cross-linking agent, such as, e.g., the disaccharide monomer units of hyaluronan. Thus, a fluid composition that that has a crosslinked matrix polymer with a 4% degree of crosslinking means that on average there are four crosslinking molecules for every 100 monomeric units. Every other parameter being equal, the greater the degree of crosslinking, the harder the gel becomes. Non-limiting examples of a degree of crosslinking include about 1% to about 15%. [020] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition comprising a uncrosslinked matrix polymer. As used herein, the term “uncrosslinked” refers to a lack of intermolecular bonds joining the individual matrix polymer molecules, or monomer chains. As such, an uncrosslinked matrix polymer is not linked to any other matrix polymer by an intermolecular bond. [021] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition comprising a substantially uncrosslinked matrix polymer. As sued herein, the term “substantially uncrosslinked” refers to the presence of uncrosslinked matrix polymers in a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification at a level of at least 90% by weight of the composition, with the remaining at most 10% by weight of the composition being comprised of other components including crosslinked matrix polymers. The matrix polymer included in a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification exhibit a low degree of cross-linking in order to remain water soluble. [022] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition that is essentially free of a crosslinked matrix polymer. As used herein, the term “essentially free” (or “consisting essentially of) refers to a fluid composition where only trace amounts of cross-linked matrix polymers can be detected. [023] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition that is entirely free of a crosslinked matrix polymer. As used herein, the term ‘‘entirely free” refers to a fluid composition that within the detection range of the instrument or process being used, crosslinked matrix polymers cannot be detected or its presence cannot be confirmed. [024] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition comprising a ratio of crosslinked matrix polymer and uncrosslinked polymer. This ratio of crosslinked and uncrosslinked matrix polymer is also known as the gekfluid ratio. Any gel'.fluid ratio is useful in making the fluid compositions disclosed in the present specification with the proviso that such ratio produces a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification that improves a skin condition as disclosed in the present specification. Non-limiting examples of gekfluid ratios include 100:0, 98:2, 90:10, 75:25, 70:30, 60:40, 50:50, 40:60, 30:70, 25:75, 10:90; 2:98, and 0:100. [025] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition comprising a matrix polymer having a mean molecular weight. As used herein, the term “molecular weight” refers to the sum of the atomic weights of the atoms in a molecule. For example, that of methane (CH4) is 16.043 g/mol, the atomic weights being carbon = 12.011 g/mol, hydrogen = 1.008 g/mol.

[055] In other aspects of this embodiment, a fluid composition comprises a crosslinked hyaluronan and an uncrosslinked hyaluronan where the gekfluid ratio is, e.g., about 15:85, about 20:80, about 25:75, about 30:70, about 35:65, about 40:60, about 45:55, about 50:50, about 55:45, about 60:40, about 65:35, about 70:30, about 75:25, about 80:20, about 85:15, about 90:10, about 95:5, about 98:2, or about 100:0. In yet other aspects of this embodiment, a fluid composition comprises a crosslinked hyaluronan and an uncrosslinked hyaluronan where the gekfluid ratio is, e.g., at most 15:85, at most 20:80, at most 25:75, at most 30:70, at most 35:65, at most 40:60, at most 45:55, at most 50:50, at most 55:45, at most 60:40, at most 65:35, at most 70:30, at most 75:25, at most 80:20, at most 85:15, at most 90:10, at most 95:5, at most 98:2, or at most 100:0.

[056] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition comprising a stabilizing component. As used herein, the term “stabilizing component” refers to a molecule that reduces or prevents the degradation of a matrix polymer disclosed in the present specification. The stabilizing component can reduce or prevent enzymatic degradation and/or reduce or prevent chemical degradation. Non-limiting examples of stabilizing components include a polyol and a flavinoid. [057] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition comprising a polyol. As used herein, the term “polyol” is synonymous with “sugar alcohol,” “polyhydric alcohol,” and “polyalcohol” and refers to a hydrogenated form of carbohydrate, whose carbonyl group (aldehyde or ketone, reducing sugar) has been reduced to a primary or secondary hydroxyl group (hence the alcohol), such as, e.g., mannitol from mannose, xylitol from xylose, and lactitol from lactulose. Polyols have the general formula H(HCHO)n+1H. Both monosaccharides and disaccharides can form polyols; however, polyols derived from disaccharides are not entirely hydrogenated because only one aldehyde group is available for reduction. A fluid composition disclosed in the present specification may comprise a single polyol, or a plurality of polyols. [058] A fluid composition disclosed in the present specification comprises a polyol that is pharmaceutically acceptable. As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means any molecular entity or composition that does not produce an adverse, allergic or other untoward or unwanted reaction when administered to a mammal. It is known in the art that the two-carbon polyol, glycol, is not pharmaceutically acceptable because this polyol is toxic to mammals. It is also known in the art that polyols comprising three or more carbon atoms are typically pharmaceutically acceptable. As such, polyols comprising three or more carbon atoms are generally useful in making the compositions disclosed in the present specification. [059] A fluid composition disclosed in the present specification comprises a polyol in an amount sufficient to protect uncrosslinked glycosaminoglycans, like hyaluronan, from degradation, such as enzymatic degradation and chemical degradation. One primary means of such glycosaminoglycan degradation is chemical breakdown from exposure to free radicals, such as, e.g., OH’ radicals. Free radicals are atoms, molecules, or ions with unpaired electrons on an open shell configuration. The unpaired electrons cause them to be highly chemically reactive. [060] Free radicals play an important role in a number of biological processes, some of which are necessary for life, such as the intracellular killing of bacteria by phagocytic cells such as granulocytes and macrophages. Free radicals have also been implicated in certain cell signaling processes, called redox signaling. The two most important oxygencentered free radicals are superoxide and hydroxyl radical. They are derived from molecular oxygen under reducing conditions. For example, the superoxide anion (02_ ) can capture another electron to form the peroxide ion (022-), which in turn may react with two H+ protons to form hydrogen peroxide (H202). The degradation of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of transition metals in their reduced form (Fenton’s reaction) leads to the formation of the hydroxyl radical (OH*). A free radical formed in this way can give rise to a series of reactions leading to the formation of different species of active oxygen. Table 2 describes the principal active species of oxygen. Table 2. Principal species of active oxygen Name Chemical Symbol Comments Superoxide anion o2- Superoxide anions are formed by reduction of molecular oxygen. They are minimally reactive in aqueous media, which enables them to migrate quite a long way from their site of production. Superoxide anions have a weak oxidative action but are capable of generating more reactive radicals. Hydrogen peroxide h2o2 Hydrogen peroxides are formed either by bivalent reduction of molecular oxygen, or by dismutation of the superoxide anion. The absence of electric charges on their surface makes them very lipophilic and minimally reactive in aqueous media. The degradation of hydrogen peroxides (Fenton ‘s reaction) produces very reactive radicals called hydroxyl radicals. Hydroxyl radical OH' Hydroxyl radicals are formed by degradation of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of transition metals in their reduced form (Fenton's reaction). Hydroxyl radicals are very reactive. Their half-life is on the order of 10'9 s. Peroxyl radical ROO' Peroxyl radicals are formed by addition of molecular oxygen to free carbon radicals. They are minimally reactive. Organic hydroperoxide ROOH Organic hydroperoxides are the protonated form of peroxyl radicals. They are very reactive and decompose anew into peroxyl radicals and alcoxyl radicals. Alcoxyl radical RO' Alcoxyl radicals are formed during the degradation of organic peroxides. They are very reactive. Their half-life is on the order of 10-6 s. Nitric oxide NO' Nitric oxides are synthesized from arginine (an amino acid) via the action of nitric oxide synthetase. They interact with hydroxyl radicals to form peroxynitrites. Nitric oxide is a neuromediator and can also be used by immune cells to destroy microbes or dangerous cells. Peroxynitrite ΟΝΟΟ- Peroxynitrites are capable of oxidizing certain substances such as methionine (an amino acid serving as a constituent of proteins and enzymes) or of reacting with SOD (Cf. § 1.3.2.a) thereby “nitrating” tyrosine (another very important amino acid) Nitrosyl radical ΟΝΟΟΗ Degradation of nitrosyl radicals leads to the formation of hydroxyl radicals. Oxidizing power: OH' > RO' > ROO’ > NO' [061] However, because of their reactivity, these same free radicals can participate in unwanted side reactions resulting in cell damage. For purposes of the present specification, OH' radicals interact with the hydrogen located on the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group in the glucuronic ring of hyaluronan and other glycosaminoglycans, thereby removing it. This removal causes splitting of the glycoside bond and hence depolymerization of the polymer. Site of OH" attach [062] In general, the crosslinking observed in the hyaluronan and other matrix polymers used in dermal fillers protect these polymers against the chemical breakdown of free radical species of oxygen. This is because the bonds formed during crosslinking mask the hydrogen attached by the free radicals. However, the uncrosslinked glycosaminoglycans disclosed in the present specification is afforded no such protection. The present specification discloses an alternative means of protecting matrix polymers from oxidative degradation of free radicals. It has been determined that polyols disclosed in the present specification act as stabilizing agents that can neutralize free radicals of active oxygen. As a stabilizing, a polyol is stabilizing component that protects matrix polymers like hyaluronan against the effects of oxidative stress and limiting the degradation of the fluid compositions disclosed in the present specification. [063] Thus, any polyol is useful in making the compositions disclosed in the present specification, with the proviso that the polyol is non-toxic to a mammal and the polyol protects uncrosslinked matrix polymers like hyaluronan from degradation. Non-limiting examples of polyols include, glycerol, erythritol, threitol, arabitol, erythritol, ribitol, xylitol, galactitol (or dulcitol), gluctiol (or sorbitol), iditol, inositol, mannitol, isomalt, lactitol, maltitol, and polyglycitol. Other non-limiting examples of polyols can be found in, e.g., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems (Howard C. Ansel et al., eds., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Publishers, 7th ed. 1999); Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 20th ed. 2000); Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (Joel G. Hardman et al., eds., McGraw-Hill Professional, 10th ed. 2001); and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients (Raymond C. Rowe et al., APhA Publications, 4th edition 2003), each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. [064] Thus in an embodiment, a fluid composition comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable polyol that can reduce or prevent degradation of a matrix polymer.

[065] In another embodiment, a fluid composition comprises a single polyol that can reduce or prevent degradation of a matrix polymer. In yet another embodiment, a fluid composition comprises a plurality of polyols, each of which can reduce or prevent the degradation of a matrix polymer.

In other aspects of this embodiment, a fluid composition comprises one to five polyols, two to five polyols, three to five polyols, two to four polyols, two to five polyols, or three to five polyols.

[068] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition that can optionally comprise or not comprise a flavonoid (Table 3). A flavonoid (or bioflavonoid) refers to the class of polyphenolic ketone-containing and non-ketone-containing secondary metabolites found in plants that are well known to have diverse beneficial biochemical and antioxidant effects.

It is understood that these and other substances known in the art of pharmacology can be included in a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification. See for example, Remington’s Pharmaceutical Sciences Mac Publishing Company, Easton, PA 16th Edition 1980. [069] Aurones are compounds derived from 2-benzylidene-1-benzofuran-3-one.

Non-limiting examples of neoflavonoids include calophyllolide, coutareagenin, dalbergichromene, dalbergin, and nivetin. [074] Non-ketone-containing flavonoids, include flavan-3-ols and catechins. Flavan-3-ols (flavanols) are a class of flavonoids derived from 2-phenyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen-3-ol skeleton. Catechin possesses two benzene rings (called the A- and B-rings) and a dihydropyran heterocycle (the C-ring) with an hydroxyl group on carbon 3. The A ring is similar to a resorcinol moiety while the Β ring is similar to a catechol moiety. There are two chiral centers on the molecule on carbons 2 and 3. It has therefore four diastereoisomers. Two of the isomers are in trans configuration and are called catechin and the other two are in cis configuration and are called epicatechin. Non-limiting examples of non-ketone-containing flavonoids include afzelechin, arthromerin A, arthromerin Β, catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate, epiafzelechin, fisetinidol, gallocatechin, gallocatechin gallate, guibourtinidol, meciadanol (3-O-methylcatechin), mesquitol, robinetinidol, and thearubigin.

[078] Tannins are compounds derived from 2-phenylchromenylium. There are three major classes of tannins: hydrolyzable tannins; non-hydrolyzable tannins (condensed tannins; proanthocyanidins); and pseudotannins. [079] Hydrolyzable tannins are themselves divided into four groups: oliomer tannins including aglycone tannins and glycoside tannins; ellagitannins; gallotannins, and unclassified tannins.

[099] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification exhibiting a complex modulus, an elastic modulus, a viscous modulus and a tan δ. Matrix polymers disclosed in the present specification are viscoelastic in that the composition has an elastic component (solid-like such as, e.g., crosslinked matrix polymer) and a viscous component (liquid-like such as, e.g., uncrosslinked matrix polymer) when a force is applied (stress, deformation). The rheological attribute that described this property is the complex modulus (G*), which defines a fluid compositions total resistance to deformation. The complex modulus can be defined as the sum of the elastic modulus (G’) and the viscous modulus (G”). Falcone, et al., Temporary Polysaccharide Dermal Fillers: A Model for Persistence Based on Physical Properties, Dermatol Surg. 35(8): 1238-1243 (2009); Tezel, supra, 2008; Kablik, supra, 2009; Beasley, supra, 2009; each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Elastic modulus characterizes the firmness of a composition and is also known as the storage modulus because it describes the storage of energy from the motion of the composition. The elastic modulus describes the interaction between elasticity and strength (G’ = stress/strain) and, as such, provides a quantitative measurement of a composition’s hardness or softness. Although depending on the speed at which the force is applied, a stiffer composition will have a higher elastic modulus and it will take a greater force to deform the material a given distance, such as, e.g., an injection. [0100] Viscous modulus is also known as the loss modulus because it describes the energy that is lost as viscous dissipation. Tan δ is the ratio of the viscous modulus and the elastic modulus, tan δ = G’/G”. Falcone, supra, 2009. For tan δ values disclosed in the present specification, a tan δ is obtained from the dynamic modulus at a frequency of 0.628 rad/s.

[0105] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification exhibiting a dynamic viscosity. Viscosity is resistance of a fluid to shear or flow caused by either shear stress or tensile stress. Viscosity describes a fluid's internal resistance to flow caused by intermolecular friction exerted when layers of fluids attempt to slide by one another and may be thought of as a measure of fluid friction. The less viscous the fluid, the greater its ease of movement (fluidity). [0106] Viscosity can be defined in two ways; dynamic viscosity (μ, although η is sometimes used) or kinematic viscosity (ν). Dynamic viscosity, also known as absolute or complex viscosity, is the tangential force per unit area required to move one horizontal plane with respect to the other at unit velocity when maintained a unit distance apart by the fluid. The SI physical unit of dynamic viscosity is the Pascal-second (Pa s), which is identical to N-m-2-s. Dynamic viscosity can be expressed as τ = μ dvx/dz, where τ = shearing stress, μ = dynamic viscosity, and dvx/dz is the velocity gradient over time. For example, if a fluid with a viscosity of one Pa-s is placed between two plates, and one plate is pushed sideways with a shear stress of one Pascal, it moves a distance equal to the thickness of the layer between the plates in one second. Dynamic viscosity symbolize by is also used, is measured with various types of rheometers, devices used to measure the way in which a liquid, suspension or slurry flows in response to applied forces. [0107] Kinematic viscosity (ν) is the ratio of dynamic viscosity to density, a quantity in which no force is involved and is defined as follows: ν = μ/ρ, where μ is the dynamic viscosity ρ is density with the SI unit of kg/m3. Kinematic viscosity is usually measured by a glass capillary viscometer as has an SI unit of m2/s. [0108] The viscosity of a fluid is highly temperature dependent and for either dynamic or kinematic viscosity to be meaningful, the reference temperature must be quoted. For the viscosity values disclosed in the present specification, a dynamic viscosity is measured at 1 Pa with a cone/plane geometry 2°/40cm and a temperature of 20 °C. Examples of the dynamic viscosity of various fluids at 20 °C is as follows: water is about 1.0 χ 10'3 Pa-s, blood is about 3-4 χ 10'3 Pa-s, vegetable oil is about 60-85 χ 10‘3 Pa-s, motor oil SE 30 is about 0.2 Pa-s, glycerin is about 1.4 Pa-s, maple syrup is about 2-3 Pa-s, honey is about 10 Pa-s, chocolate syrup is about 10-25 Pa-s, peanut butter is about 150-250 Pa-s, lard is about 1,000 Pa-s, vegetable shortening is about 1,200 Pa-s, and tar is about 30,000 Pa-s.

[0113] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification exhibiting a physiologically-acceptable osmolarity. As used herein, the term “a physiologically-acceptable osmolarity" refers to an osmolarity in accord with, or characteristic of, the normal functioning of a living organism. As such, administration of a fluid composition disclosed in the present composition exhibits an osmolarity that has substantially no long term or permanent detrimental effect when administered to mammal. Osmolarity refers to the concentration of osmotically active solutes in solution. Osmolarity is expressed in terms of osmoles of osmotically active solute per liter of solvent (Osmol/L or Osm/L). Osmolarity is distinct from molarity because it measures moles of osmotically active solute particles rather than moles of solute. The distinction arises because some compounds can dissociate in solution, whereas others cannot. The osmolarity of a solution can be calculated from the following expression: Osmol/L = Σ Φΐ η; C„ where φ is the osmotic coefficient, which accounts for the degree of non-ideality of the solution; η is the number of particles (e.g. ions) into which a molecule dissociates; and C is the molar concentration of the solute; and i is the index representing the identity of a particular solute. The osmolarity of a composition disclosed in the present specification can be measured using a conventional method that measures solutions. [0114] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification exhibiting a physiologically-acceptable osmolality. As used herein, the term “a physiologically-acceptable osmolality” refers to an osmolality in accord with, or characteristic of, the normal functioning of a living organism. As such, administration of a fluid composition disclosed in the present composition exhibits an osmolality that has substantially no long term or permanent detrimental effect when administered to mammal. Osmolality refers to the concentration of osmotically active solutes per kilo of water in the body and is expressed in terms of osmoles of osmotically active solute per kilogram of solvent (osmol/kg or Osm/kg) and is equal to the sum of the molalities of all the solutes present in that solution. The osmolality of a solution can be measured using an osmometer. The most commonly used instrument in modern laboratories is a freezing point depression osmometer. This instruments measure the change in freezing point that occurs in a solution with increasing osmolality (freezing point depression osmometer) or the change in vapor pressure that occurs in a solution with increasing osmolality (vapor pressure depression osmometer).

[0117] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification that is a pharmaceutical composition. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutical composition” is synonymous with “pharmaceutically-acceptable composition” and refers to a therapeutically effective concentration of an active ingredient, such as, e.g., any of the matrix polymers disclosed in the present specification. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a matrix polymer active ingredient is useful for medical and veterinary applications. A pharmaceutical composition may be administered to a patient alone, or in combination with other supplementary active ingredients, agents, drugs or hormones. [0118] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification that is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmacologically acceptable excipient. As used herein, the term “pharmacologically acceptable excipient” is synonymous with "pharmacological excipient” or “excipient” and refers to any excipient that has substantially no long term or permanent detrimental effect when administered to mammal and encompasses compounds such as, e.g., stabilizing agent, a bulking agent, a cryo-protectant, a lyo-protectant, an additive, a vehicle, a carrier, a diluent, or an auxiliary. An excipient generally is mixed with an active ingredient, or permitted to dilute or enclose the active ingredient and can be a solid, semisolid, or liquid agent. It is also envisioned that a pharmaceutical composition comprising a matrix polymer active ingredient can include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients that facilitate processing of an active ingredient into pharmaceutically acceptable compositions. Insofar as any pharmacologically acceptable excipient is not incompatible with the matrix polymer active ingredient, its use in pharmaceutically acceptable compositions is contemplated. Non-limiting examples of pharmacologically acceptable excipients can be found in, e.g., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems (Howard C. Ansel et al., eds., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins Publishers, 7th ed. 1999); Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins, 20th ed. 2000); Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (Joel G. Hardman et al., eds., McGraw-Hill Professional, 10th ed. 2001); and Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients (Raymond C. Rowe et al., APhA Publications, 4th edition 2003), each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Non-limiting examples of pharmaceutically acceptable buffers include acetate buffers, borate buffers, citrate buffers, neutral buffered salines, phosphate buffers, and phosphate buffered salines. Any concentration of a pharmaceutically acceptable buffer can be useful in formulating a pharmaceutical composition disclosed in the present specification, with the proviso that a therapeutically effective amount of the matrix polymer active ingredient is recovered using this effective concentration of buffer. Non-limiting examples of concentrations of physiologically-acceptable buffers occur within the range of about 0.1 mM to about 900 mM. The pH of pharmaceutically acceptable buffers may be adjusted, provided that the resulting preparation is pharmaceutically acceptable. It is understood that acids or bases can be used to adjust the pH of a pharmaceutical composition as needed. Any buffered pH level can be useful in formulating a pharmaceutical composition, with the proviso that a therapeutically effective amount of the matrix polymer active ingredient is recovered using this effective pH level. Non-limiting examples of physiologically-acceptable pH occur within the range of about pH 5.5 to about pH 8.5.

[0122] Tonicity adjustors useful in a pharmaceutical composition include, without limitation, salts such as, e.g., sodium chloride and potassium chloride; and glycerin. The pharmaceutical composition may be provided as a salt and can be formed with many acids, including but not limited to, hydrochloric, sulfuric, acetic, lactic, tartaric, malic, succinic, etc. Salts tend to be more soluble in aqueous or other protonic solvents than are the corresponding free base forms. It is understood that these and other substances known in the art of pharmacology can be included in a pharmaceutical composition useful in the invention. Other non-limiting examples of pharmacologically acceptable components can be found in, e.g., Ansel, supra, (1999); Gennaro, supra, (2000); Hardman, supra, (2001); and Rowe, supra, (2003), each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. [0123] A pharmaceutical compositions disclosed in the present specification generally is administered as a pharmaceutical acceptable composition comprising a matrix polymer active ingredient. As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" means any molecular entity or composition that does not produce an adverse, allergic or other untoward or unwanted reaction when administered to an individual.

[0126] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a method having a step of combining a stabilizing component with a physiologically-acceptable buffer to make a stabilizing component-buffered solution. A stabilizing component can be any one of the stabilizing components disclosed in the present specification. As used herein, the term “a physiologically-acceptable buffer” refers to a buffer in accord with, or characteristic of, the normal functioning of a living organism. As such, a buffer used to make a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification exhibits a buffering capacity that has substantially no long term or permanent detrimental effect when administered to mammal. Physiologically-acceptable buffers include, without limitation, acetate buffers, borate buffers, citrate buffers, neutral buffered salines, phosphate buffers, and phosphate buffered salines. In addition, the physiologically-acceptable buffer is at a concentration to achieve an effective buffering capacity. Non-limiting examples of a concentration to a physiologically-acceptable buffer to achieve an effective buffering capacity is from between about 0.1 mM to about 900 mM. [0127] Thus, in an embodiment, a stabilizing component is combined with a physiologically-acceptable buffer to make a stabilizing component-buffered solution. In aspects of this embodiment, a stabilizing component is combined with an acetate buffer, a borate buffers, a citrate buffer, a neutral buffered saline, a phosphate buffer, or a phosphate buffered saline to make a stabilizing-buffered solution. In other an stabilizing component is combined with sodium chloride, sodium phosphate, or both.

In aspects of this embodiment, a physiologically-acceptable buffer is at a concentration of, e.g., at least 0.1 mM, at least 0.2 mM, at least 0.3 mM, at least 0.4 mM, at least 0.5 mM, at least 0.6 mM, at least 0.7 mM, at least 0.8 mM, or at least 0.9 mM- In other aspects of this embodiment, a physiologically-acceptable buffer is at a concentration of, e.g., at least 1.0 mM, at least 2.0 mM, at least 3.0 mM, at least 4.0 mM, at least 5.0 mM, at least 6.0 mM, at least 7.0 mM, at least 8.0 mM, or at least 9.0 mM. In yet other aspects of this embodiment, a physiologically-acceptable buffer is at a concentration of, e.g., at least 10 mM, at least 20 mM, at least 30 mM, at least 40 mM, at least 50 mM, at least 60 mM, at least 70 mM, at least 80 mM, or at least 90 mM.

In yet other aspects of this embodiment, a physiologically-acceptable buffer is at a concentration of, e.g., at most 10 mM, at most 20 mM, at most 30 mM, at most 40 mM, at most 50 mM, at most 60 mM, at most 70 mM, at most 80 mM, or at most 90 mM. In still other aspects of this embodiment, a physiologically-acceptable buffer is at a concentration of, e.g., at most 100 mM, at most 200 mM, at most 300 mM, at most 400 mM, at most 500 mM, at most 600 mM, at most 700 mM, at most 800 mM, or at most 900 mM.

[0130] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a method having an optional step of titrating a stabilizing component-buffered solution to obtain a desired pH. A stabilizing component-buffered solution can be titrated to any physiologically-acceptable pH desired. As used herein, the term “a physiologically-acceptable pH” refers to a pH in accord with, or characteristic of, the normal functioning of a living organism. As such, a pH used to make a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification is a pH that has substantially no long term or permanent detrimental effect when administered to mammal. Non-limiting examples of physiologically-acceptable pH occur within the range of about pH 5.5 to, about pH 8.5. It is understood that acids or bases can be used to adjust the pH of a stabilizing component-buffered solution. [0131] Thus, in an embodiment, a stabilizing component-buffered solution is titrated to a physiologically-acceptable pH. In an aspect of this embodiment, a stabilizing component-buffered solution is titrated to pH of, e.g., at least about pH 5.0, at least about pH 5.5, at least about pH 6.0, at least about pH 6.5, at least about pH 7.0 or at about pH 7.5. In another aspect of this embodiment, a stabilizing component-buffered solution is titrated to pH of, e.g., at most about pH 5.0, at most about pH 5.5, at most about pH 6.0, at most about pH 6.5, at most about pH 7.0 or at most about pH 7.5. In yet another aspect of this embodiment, a stabilizing component-buffered solution is titrated to pH of, e.g., about pH 5.0 to about pH 8.0, an effective pH level is about pH 5.0 to about pH 7.0, an effective pH level is about pH 5.0 to about pH 6.0, is about pH 5.5 to about pH 8.0, an effective pH level is about pH 5.5 to about pH 7.0, an effective pH level is about pH 5.5 to about pH 5.0, is about pH 5.5 to about pH 7.5, an effective pH level is about pH 5.5 to about pH 6.5. [0132] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a method having an optional step of filtering a stabilizing component-buffered solution to remove particulates and impurities. For example, a stabilizing component-buffered solution may, or may not, be filtered to remove particulates and impurities from the stabilizing component-buffered solution. The filters used should be of a pore size that sufficiently removes the particulates and impurities desired to be removed from a stabilizing component-buffered solution. Non-limiting examples of pore sizes are of the range of 5.0 pm or less. [0133] Thus, in an embodiment, a stabilizing component-buffered solution is filtered to remove particulates and impurities. In an aspect of this embodiment, a stabilizing component-buffered solution is filtered through a pore size sufficient to remove particulates and impurities. In other aspects of this embodiment, a stabilizing component-buffered solution is filtered through a pore size of, e.g., about 0.1 pm or less, about 0.25 pm or less, about 0.5 pm or less, about 0.75 pm or less, about 1 pm or less, about 2 pm or less, about 3 pm or less, about 4 pm or less, or about 5 pm or less. [0134] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a method having a step of combining a matrix polymer with a stabilizing component-buffered solution to hydrate the matrix polymer. A matrix polymer can be any one of the matrix polymers disclosed in the present specification, its salts, and/or mixtures thereof. A matrix polymer can be a partially crosslinked matrix polymer, a substantially uncrosslinked matrix polymer, a matrix polymer that is essentially free of a crosslinked matrix polymer, or a matrix polymer that is entirely free of a crosslinked matrix polymer as disclosed in the present specification. The source of the matrix polymer can be from a bacterial source or an animal source. [0135] Combining a matrix polymer with a stabilizing component-buffered solution can be accomplished by any method with the proviso that the method used is sufficient to hydrate the matrix polymer in a manner that produces a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification. It is also understood that any method employed does not result in substantial degradation of matrix polymer as this is inconsistent with a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification. For example, the step of combining a matrix polymer with a stabilizing component-buffered solution can comprises mixing a matrix polymer with a stabilizing component-buffered solution at a low speed for a relatively long period of time. Non-limiting examples of a speed used for mixing is from about 50 rpm to about 500 rpm. The relatively long time period for agitation is a time period sufficient to effectively combine a matrix polymer with a stabilizing component-buffered solution to allow the matrix polymer to hydrate. Non-limiting examples of time periods for mixing at a relative low speed include from about 4 hours to about 16 hours. This combining step is performed at cool ambient temperature. Non-limiting examples of a cool ambient temperature include a temperature not exceeding about 25 °C, such as, a temperature not exceeding about 20 °C, a temperature not exceeding about 15 °C, or a temperature not exceeding about 10 °C. As another non-limiting example, a cool ambient temperature is a temperature from about 2° C and about 8 °C. [0136] As another non-limiting example, the step of combining a matrix polymer with a stabilizing component-buffered solution may, or may not, involve a cycle of alternating periods of agitation for a relatively short period of time followed by periods of rest for a relatively long period of time. This agitation/rest step may be performed once in order to combine a matrix polymer with a stabilizing component-buffered solution composition, or may be performed for a plurality of times. For example, the agitation/rest step may be performed two or more times, five or more times, or ten or more times. Agitation of a matrix polymer with a stabilizing component-buffered solution can be accomplished by any method sufficient to agitate the composition including, without limitation, mechanical shaking, manual shaking, ultrasound, vibration, and the like, and combinations thereof. The relatively short time period for agitation is a time period sufficient to effectively combine a matrix polymer with a stabilizing component-buffered solution to create a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification. Non-limiting examples of time periods for agitation include from about 1 minute to about 15 minutes. Similarly, the relatively long time period for rest is a time period sufficient to effectively combine a matrix polymer with a stabilizing component-buffered solution to create a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification. Non-limiting examples of time periods for rest include from about 15 minute to about 180 minutes. For example, a matrix polymer with a stabilizing component-buffered solution composition can be agitated for about 1 minute and then allowed to rest for about 30 minutes. If such an agitation/rest step is used, it typically follows the combining step comprising a low speed for a relatively long period of time described above. [0137] After combining a matrix polymer with a stabilizing component-buffered solution, this composition is allowed to rest for a relative long period of time. A relatively long time period for rest is a time period sufficient to effectively combine a matrix polymer with a stabilizing component-buffered solution to create a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification. Non-limiting examples of time periods for resting after the combining step include from about 4 hours to about 16 hours. [0138] Thus, in an embodiment, a matrix polymer is combined with a stabilizing component-buffered solution in order to hydrate the matrix polymer. In an aspect of this embodiment, a matrix polymer is combined with a stabilizing component-buffered solution in order to hydrate the matrix polymer and achieve a smooth consistency of the composition. In other aspects of this embodiment, a stabilizing component-buffered solution is combined with a partially crosslinked matrix polymer, a substantially uncrosslinked matrix polymer, a matrix polymer that is essentially free of a crosslinked matrix polymer, or a matrix polymer that is entirely free of a crosslinked matrix polymer. [0139] In another embodiment, a matrix polymer is combined with a stabilizing component-buffered solution by mixing the matrix polymer with the stabilizing component-buffered solution at a low speed for a relatively long period of time. In aspects of this embodiment, a matrix polymer is combined with a stabilizing component-buffered solution by mixing the matrix polymer with the stabilizing component-buffered solution at, e.g., about 50 rpm, about 100 rpm, about 150 rpm, about 200 rpm, about 250 rpm, about 300 rpm, about 350 rpm, about 400 rpm, about 450 rpm, or about 500 rpm for about 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours, 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours, 13 hours, or 14 hours.

In still other aspects of this embodiment, a matrix polymer is combined with a stabilizing component-buffered solution by mixing the matrix polymer with the stabilizing component-buffered solution at about 50 rpm to about 500 rpm for about 8 hours to about 12 hours. [0140] In another embodiment, a matrix polymer is combined with a stabilizing component-buffered solution by mixing the matrix polymer with the stabilizing component-buffered solution using a cycle of alternating periods of agitation for a relatively short period of time followed by periods of rest for a relatively long period of time. In aspects of this embodiment, a matrix polymer and a stabilizing component-buffered solution is agitated for about 1 minute, about 5 minutes, about 10 minutes, or about 15 minutes, and then allowed to rest for about 15 minutes, about 30 minutes, about 45 minutes, about 60 minutes, about 75 minutes, about 90 minutes, about 105 minutes, about 120 minutes, about 135 minutes, about 150 minutes, about 165 minutes, or about 180 minutes.

[0141] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a method having a step of sizing the fluid composition. Sizing the fluid composition is particularly important if crosslinked matrix polymers are present because this step 1) produces a composition with a particular mean sized of gel particle, and/or 2) produces a composition with a smooth consistency as opposed to a granular consistency. In fluid compositions comprising a crosslinked matrix polymer, the initial crosslinking process produces a large gel mass that must be sized down in order to produce a composition that can be properly administered to an individual, such as, e.g., by injection. Sizing of gel particles can be accomplished by any method suitable to produce a fluid composition that can be properly administered into an individual. Non-limiting examples include sieving and homogenization. In a sieving method, a large gel mass included in a fluid composition is broken down by passing through a series of sieves or screens in order to size the gel particles. This method produces gel particles that have a well-defined average size. In a homogenization method, a large gel mass included in a fluid composition is broken down by recirculating the fluid composition between a first vessel and a second vessel through a narrow aperture. The recirculation of a fluid composition may comprise passing the composition from a first vessel into a second vessel through an orifice having any diameter sufficient to achieve a smooth fluid composition. Non-limiting examples of orifice diameters include about 2 mm to about 10 mm. The recirculating step can be performed once or a plurality of times, such as, e.g., from 2 to 10 times. [0142] Thus, in an embodiment, a fluid composition is sized. In other aspects of this embodiment, a fluid composition is sized by sieving wherein after sizing the mean particle size of the crosslinked matrix polymer is, e.g., about 200 pm, about 250 pm, about 300 pm, about 350 pm, about 400 pm, about 450 pm, about 500 pm, about 550 pm, about 600 pm, about 650 pm, about 700 pm, about 750 pm, or about 800 pm.

[0152] Aspects of the present specification provide, in part, a method having an optional step of sterilizing a syringe filled with a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification. As used herein, the term "sterilizing” refers to any method known in the art to effectively kill or eliminate transmissible agents without substantially altering of degrading a fluid composition disclosed in the specification. A sterilized fluid composition can remain stable for about 3 months to about 3 years. One method of sterilization of a filled syringe is by autoclave. Autoclaving can be accomplished by applying a mixture of heat, pressure and moisture to a sample in need of sterilization. Many different sterilization temperatures, pressures and cycle times can be used for this step. For example, the filled syringes may be sterilized at a temperature of at least about 120°C to about 130°C or greater. Moisture may or may not be utilized. The pressure applied is in some embodiments depending on the temperature used in the sterilization process. The sterilization cycle may be at least about 1 minute to about 20 minutes or more. [0153] Another method of sterilization incorporates the use of a gaseous species which is known to kill or eliminate transmissible agents. Preferably, ethylene oxide is used as the sterilization gas and is known in the art to be useful in sterilizing medical devices and products. [0154] A further method of sterilization incorporates the use of an irradiation source which is known in the art to kill or eliminate transmissible agents. A beam of irradiation is targeted at the syringe containing the HA composition, and the wavelength of energy kills or eliminates the unwanted transmissible agents. Preferable energy useful include, but is not limited to ultraviolet (UV) light, gamma irradiation, visible light, microwaves, or any other wavelength or band of wavelengths which kills or eliminates the unwanted transmissible agents, preferably without substantially altering of degrading the HA composition.

[0161] Aspects of the present invention provide, in part, a dermal region. As used herein, the term “dermal region” refers to the region of skin comprising the epidermal-dermal junction and the dermis including the superficial dermis (papillary region) and the deep dermis (reticular region). The skin is composed of three primary layers: the epidermis, which provides waterproofing and serves as a barrier to infection; the dermis, which serves as a location for the appendages of skin; and the hypodermis (subcutaneous adipose layer). The epidermis contains no blood vessels, and is nourished by diffusion from the dermis. The main type of cells which make up the epidermis are keratinocytes, melanocytes, Langerhans cells and Merkels cells. [0162] The dermis is the layer of skin beneath the epidermis that consists of connective tissue and cushions the body from stress and strain. The dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis by a basement membrane. It also harbors many Mechanoreceptor/nerve endings that provide the sense of touch and heat. It contains the hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, apocrine glands, lymphatic vessels and blood vessels. The blood vessels in the dermis provide nourishment and waste removal from Its own cells as well as from the Stratum basale of the epidermis. The dermis is structurally divided into two areas: a superficial area adjacent to the epidermis, called the papillary region, and a deep thicker area known as the reticular region. [0163] The papillary region is composed of loose areolar connective tissue. It is named for its fingerlike projections called papillae that extend toward the epidermis. The papillae provide the dermis with a "bumpy'1 surface that interdigitates with the epidermis, strengthening the connection between the two layers of skin. The reticular region lies deep in the papillary region and is usually much thicker. It is composed of dense irregular connective tissue, and receives its name from the dense concentration of collagenous, elastic, and reticular fibers that weave throughout it. These protein fibers give the dermis its properties of strength, extensibility, and elasticity. Also located within the reticular region are the roots of the hair, sebaceous glands, sweat glands, receptors, nails, and blood vessels. Tattoo ink is held in the dermis. Stretch marks from pregnancy are also located in the dermis. [0164] The hypodermis is not part of the skin, and lies below the dermis. Its purpose is to attach the skin to underlying bone and muscle as well as supplying it with blood vessels and nerves. It consists of loose connective tissue and elastin. The main cell types are fibroblasts, macrophages and adipocytes (the hypodermis contains 50% of body fat). Fat serves as padding and insulation for the body. [0165] Aspects of the present invention provide, in part, an individual. As used herein, the term "individual” refers to any mammal including a human being. [0166] Aspects of the present invention provide, in part, administering a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification. As used herein, the term “administering” means any delivery mechanism that provides a fluid composition comprising a matrix polymer and a stabilizing component to an individual that potentially results in a clinically, therapeutically, or experimentally beneficial result. The actual delivery mechanism used to administer a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification to an individual can be determined by a person of ordinary skill in the art by taking into account factors, including, without limitation, the type of skin condition, the location of the skin condition, the cause of the skin condition, the severity of the skin condition, the degree of relief desired, the duration of relief desired, the particular fluid composition used, the rate of excretion of the particular fluid composition used, the pharmacodynamics of the particular fluid composition used, the nature of the other compounds included in the particular fluid composition used, the particular route of administration, the particular characteristics, history and risk factors of the individual, such as, e.g., age, weight, general health and the like, or any combination thereof. [0167] Thus, in an embodiment, a fluid composition comprising a matrix polymer and a stabilizing component is administered to a skin region of an individual. In an aspect of this embodiment, a fluid composition comprising a matrix polymer and a stabilizing component is administered to a skin region of an individual by injection. In another aspect of this embodiment, a fluid composition comprising a matrix polymer and a stabilizing component is administered to a skin region of an individual by injection into a dermal region. In aspects of this embodiment, a fluid composition comprising a matrix polymer and a stabilizing component is administered to a skin region of an individual by injection into, e.g., an epidermal-dermal junction region, a papillary region, a reticular region, or any combination thereof. EXAMPLES [0168] The following examples illustrate representative embodiments now contemplated, but should not be construed to limit the disclosed fluid compositions, methods of forming such fluid compositions, and methods of treating skin conditions using such fluid compositions. Example 1 A Method of Making a Fluid Composition [0169] This example illustrates how to make a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification. [0170] To combine a stabilizing component with a physiologically-acceptable buffer to make a stabilizing component-buffered solution, 0.9 g of mannitol (Cooper Pharmaceutical, Inc.) was added to 1 L of a phosphate buffer solution (comprising 8.5 g NaCI, 0.563 g NaH2P04, 0.045 g Na2HP04, and water) in a 10 liter bottle, and mixed for 15 minutes. This step produces a stabilizing component-buffered solution comprising a phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.2) containing 0.9mg/mL of mannitol. [0171] To filter the stabilizing component-buffered solution, the mannitol-phosphate buffer solution made above was filtered on line with a 0.2 pm filter under pressure. [0172] To combining a matrix polymer with the stabilizing component-buffered solution to hydrate the matrix polymer, about 60% of the mannitol-phosphate buffer solution was poured in a new bottle and uncrosslinked sodium hyaluronan polymer having a molecular weight between about 2.5 MDa and about 3.0 MDa was added to the mannitol-phosphate buffer solution. This was completed with the remaining 40% of the mannitol-phosphate buffer solution, giving a final concentration of uncrosslinked hyaluronan of about 13.5 mg/L. This composition was then gently, mechanically mixed at a speed of about 100 rpm to about 200 rpm for about 8 hours to about 12 hours at a cool ambient temperature of about 2 °C to about 8 °C. The composition was then subjected to agitation by manually shaking the bottle containing the composition for about 1 minute, followed by a period of rest for about 30 minutes. This mixing step was repeated three additional times before the composition was then allowed to rest about 8 to about 12 hours. [0173] To size a fluid composition, the fluid composition above was recirculated four times from one bottle into a second bottle thorough a narrow orifice having a diameter of about 3 mm and about 5 mm. [0174] To degas a fluid composition, the composition described above was degassed for about four hours using standard device based on conventional techniques. Example 2 Stabilizing Component Reduces or Prevents Degradation of Matrix Polymer [0175] This example illustrates that the addition of a stabilizing component reduces or prevents degradation of a matrix polymer included in a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification. [0176] Fluid compositions made for testing were prepared as described in Example 1, except that 1)1 mL of each fluid composition was made and the amount of mannitol added to the test fluid compositions was 0% (w/v) for control, 0.5% (w/v) and 5% (w/v). [0177] Degradation of hyaluronan polymer included in the fluid compositions and rheological processing of the results were performed according to conventional methods. Resistance of hyaluronan polymer to degradation was assessed in fluid composition with and without mannitol and these compositions were compared by analyzing the time it took for the composition to reach a dynamic viscosity of 5 Pa s [Τ(η4 = 5 Pa-s)]. The degradation test was repeated twice and a mean dynamic viscosity [T(rf = 5 Pa s)mean] was calculated from the 2 tests (Table 4). In general, the shorter the time to reach a dynamic viscosity of 5 Pa-s [T(rf = 5 Pa-s)], the lower the resistance of hyaluronan polymer to degradation. Thus, to show that addition of mannitol to a fluid composition had a beneficial effect on resistance of hyaluronan polymer to breakdown, it was shown that T(r| = 5 Pa-s)nA with mannitol ^ Τ(∩ = 5 Pa-s) ha without mannitol- For each fluid composition the results of the rheological test (values of G’, G”, tan δ, rf = f(time) + mathematical model of curve rf = f(time)) were determined and the curves obtained (FIG. 1). Table 4. Breakdown Test Fluid Composition Test T(n* = 5 Pa s) Mean T(g* = 5 Pa-s) Std. deviation CV(%) Hyaluronan (13.5 mg/L) 1 2 747 1452 1099 498 45 Hyaluronan (13.5 mg/L) 1 3351 3127 317 10 5% mannitol 2 2903 Hyaluronan (13.5 mg/L) 0.5% mannitol 1 2 2933 1776 2355 818 35 [0178] As shown in Table 4, hyaluronan polymer was more resistant to degradation when mannitol was included in the fluid composition as compared to the resistance hyaluronan polymer in composition without mannitol (Table 4, FIG. 1). In fact, the higher the mannitol concentration in a fluid composition, the longer the time required for the hyaluronan polymer to degrade. As such, incorporating a stabilizing component like mannitol into a fluid composition allowed uncrosslinked hyaluronan polymer remained intact longer because the stabilizing component increased the resistance of hyaluronan polymer to degradation (Fig. 1). Thus, the addition of a stabilizing component to a fluid composition provided protection to a matrix polymer to degradation. Example 2 Effects of Stabilizing Component on Various Properties of Fluid Composition [0179] This example illustrates the effects of a stabilizing component on various properties of a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification including fluid appearance, pH, osmolarity, and dynamic viscosity. [0180] Fluid compositions made for testing were prepared as described in Example 1, except that 1) 1 mL of each fluid composition was made and the amount of mannitol added to the test fluid compositions was 0% (w/v) for control, 0.5% (w/v), 5% (w/ν), 9%(w/v), and 17%(w/ν). [0181] The appearance of the fluid compositions was visually examined. Test compositions comprising 0% (w/v), 0.5% (w/v), 5% (w/v), and 9% (w/v) mannitol all appeared colorless and transparent, while the fluid composition comprising 17% (w/v) mannitol appeared white and cloudy (Table 5). These results indicate that mannitol was soluble in all fluid compositions tested, except for the composition comprising 17% (w/v) mannitol. Furthermore, it is known that mannitol solubility in water is 1g mannitol / 5.5 ml water, i.e. mass solubility of 15.4%. Taken together, these results indicate that fluid compositions comprising a matrix polymer can include about 15.4% mannitol before this polyol begins to precipitate out of solution. [0182] The pH of the fluid compositions was measured using a pH meter. Test compositions comprising 0% (w/v), 0.5% (w/v), 5% (w/v), and 9% (w/v) mannitol all had a pH of 6.9, while the fluid composition comprising 17% (w/v) had a pH of 6.8 (Table 5). These results indicate that mannitol has no effect on the pH of a fluid composition because all pH values were within the measurement error range of the pH meter (± 0.2). [0183] The osomolarity of the fluid compositions was measured using an osmometer. Test compositions exhibited a wide range of osmolarity that was correlated with the amount of mannitol added to the composition (Table 5). In general, the osmolarity of a fluid composition increase as the amount of mannitol increased. The results indicated that a fluid composition comprising a matrix polymer and 0.5% mannitol preserved the required osmolarity for hyaluronan, namely an osmolarity range of about 270 mOsm/L to about 390 mOsm/L. It general, an osmolarity range of about 200 mOsm/L to about 400 mOsm/L is the range approved for viscoelastic ophthalmic devices. [0184] The data obtained from the osmolarity test were further analyzed by linear regression. This analysis revealed that y = 68.576χ - 17.118 and that R2 ≈ 0.9888. From this formula, it was calculated that the addition of 1% mannitol to a fluid composition comprising hyaluronan would increase the osmolarity of the composition by 52 mOsm/L to approximately 351 mOsm/L. As such, a fluid composition comprising a matrix polymer and 1% mannitol was an effective combination that balanced the opposite effects of improving a fluid composition’s resistance to hyaluronan degradation and the increase in osmolarity upon addition of mannitol to the composition. Table 5. Mannitol Effects on Properties of Fluid Compositions Fluid Composition Appearance of Fluid Composition pH Osmolarity (mOsm/L) Hyaluronan (13.5 mg/L) Colorless and transparent 6.9 299 Hyaluronan (13.5 mg/L) Mannitol (0.5%) Colorless and transparent 6.9 333 Hyaluronan (13.5 mg/L) Mannitol (5%) Colorless and transparent 6.9 589 Hyaluronan (13.5 mg/L) Mannitol (9%) Colorless and transparent 6.9 918 Hyaluronan (13.5 mg/L) Mannitol (17%) White and cloudy 6.8 ND [0185] The dynamic viscosity of the fluid compositions was measured using a rheometer. Test compositions comprising 0% (w/ν), 5% (w/v), and 9% (w/v) mannitol exhibited a consistent dynamic viscosity over time and all within 20 Pa s of each other at 1 Pa (FIG. 2). The mean dynamic viscosity of these three fluid compositions was as follows: compositions comprising 0% (w/v) mannitol had a mean dynamic viscosity of 162 Pa s; compositions comprising 5% (w/v) mannitol had a mean dynamic viscosity of 152 Pa s; compositions comprising 9% (w/v) mannitol had a mean dynamic viscosity of 148 Pa s. These results indicate that the effect of a stabilizing component was negligible because the addition of mannitol in an amount less than or equal to about 9% only resulted in a change in dynamic viscosity of about 20 Pa s at 1 Pa. Example 3 Effects of Sterilization on Fluid Compositions Comprising a stabilizing Component [0186] This example illustrates the effects of sterilization on various properties of a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification including pH, dynamic viscosity and stability of stabilizing component. [0187] Fluid compositions made for testing were prepared as described in Example 1, except that 1) 1 ml_ of each fluid composition was made and the amount of mannitol added to the test fluid compositions was 0% (w/v) and 1.1%(w/v). Fluid compositions prepared above were filled in a glass syringe and sterilized by autoclaving at 130 °C for 3 minutes. [0188] The pH of the fluid compositions was measured using a pH meter. These results indicate that sterilization had no effect on the pH of a fluid composition because all pH values were within the measurement error range of the pH meter (± 0.2) (Table 6). [0189] The dynamic viscosity of the fluid compositions was measured before and after sterilization using a rheometer. The difference in viscosity before and after sterilization was 54 Pa s for fluid compositions without mannitol and 61 Pa s for fluid compositions comprising 1.1% (w/v) mannitol (Table 6). These results indicate that the addition of a stabilizing component had a negligible effect on dynamic viscosity because the difference between the two compositions was within the measurement error range of the rheometer (± 10%). As such, there was no significant difference in dynamic viscosity of the fluid compositions before and after sterilization. [0190] The chemical and physical stability of mannitol after sterilization was determined by autoclaving 25% Mannitol (Invenex Pharmaceuticals, Itasca, IL) five times at 121 °C for 15 minutes. The results indicate that mannitol was chemically and physically stable after this sterilization regime. Table 6.

[0192] Fluid compositions were prepared as described in Example 1, except that the amount of mannitol added to the test fluid compositions was about 1% (w/v). The degassed fluid composition was then filled into a glass syringe and sterilized by autoclaving at 130 °C for 3 minutes. [0193] The resulting composition-filled syringes will be stored at about 2 °C to about 8 °C and at about 18 °C to about 22 °C to determine shelf life of the fluid compositions. The stored compositions will be tested for various properties including dynamic viscosity, pH appearance and osmolarity at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months, and 36 months. These tests will determine the stability of fluid composition-filled syringes and as such the shelf life of such products. Example 5 Safety and Efficacy Study of Fluid Composition [0194] This example illustrates the safety and efficacy of a fluid composition disclosed in the present specification. [0195] Fluid compositions were prepared as described in Example 1, except that the amount of mannitol added to the test fluid compositions was about 1% (w/v). The degassed fluid composition was then filled into a glass syringe and sterilized by autoclaving at 130 °C for 3 minutes. [0196] The study included 39 individuals and comprised men and women between the ages of 30 and 45 years. All baseline data including consent, demographics, adverse events and skin evidence was collected from each individual before the study began. After the baseline visit, each individual was subdermally injected with the fluid composition described above and this was considered day 0 (DO). Follow-up visits took place at day 15 (D15 ±7 days) for the second injection, at day 30 (D30 ±7 days) for the third injection and finally at day 60 (D60 ±7 days) for final assessment. Dermal administration was performed using either a depot injection method or picotage injection method. At each study visit, individuals were examined for adverse events and skin evidence, and a questionnaire was given to assess physician and subject satisfaction. The total study duration was 60 days. [0197] The study evaluated efficacy of the compositions on hydration and elasticity of the skin after 60 days of use of the fluid composition on different skin areas including the region around the eye, the cheek region, the peri-oral region, and the neck region. Skin measurements were assessed at each of the four visits from day 0 to day 60, on different areas, by Skin Evidence for IOMA™ (IntuiSkin, Research Triangle Park, NC). Skin Evidence for IOMA is a probe-based system that measures the physical and visual parameters of the skin. The Visio Probe uses its high-resolution sensor to capture with an extreme precision the skin images including wrinkles, sebum, hairiness, dark spots, and clogged pores/bacterial infection. The Physio Probe contains high-technology sensors and extracts in vivo the key characteristics of the skin including hydration, transepidermal water loss (TEWL), and the skin temperature. [0198] For each individual administered the fluid composition using a depot injection method, the cheek, neck, peri-oral and eye regions were measured for hydration (%) at each visit from DO to D60 by Skin Evidence for IOMA™ and a mean hydration was determined at each visit (Table 7). Coefficient of anisotropy (%), arithmetical roughness (Ra), and luminance (L) were also measured for each individual at each visit from DO to D60 by Skin Evidence for IOMA™ and mean values calculated. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS® software version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC). The results indicate that overall skin hydration of the cheek (ρ = 0.0036), neck (ρ = 0.0346) and peri-oral (ρ = 0.0024) regions was significantly increased by the treatment with the fluid composition. In particular, skin hydration of the cheek region was significantly increased by D15 of treatment (mean of 55.8%) as compared to DO (mean of 50.9%) and this improvement in skin condition was maintain through D30 of treatment (mean of 56.4%) as compared to DO (mean of 50.9%, ρ = 0.0262) and D60 of treatment (mean of 59.3%) as compared to DO (mean of 50.9%, ρ = 0.0021). In addition, skin hydration of the neck region was significantly increased by D15 of treatment (mean of 66.0%) as compared to DO (mean of 59.0%) and this improvement in skin condition was maintain through D30 of treatment (mean of 66.5%) of as compared to DO (mean of 59.0%, ρ = 0.0022), and D60 of treatment (mean of 65.3%) as compared to DO (mean of 59.0%, ρ = 0.0448).

The results indicated that there was no statistically significant difference in the hydration of the cheek, neck, peri-oral, or eye regions of individuals administered the fluid compositions using the picotage injection method. [0200] With respect to anisotrophy, the results indicate an overall improvement of skin condition from the neck and peri-oral regions when the fluid composition was administered using a depot injection method. No statistically significant difference was observed in anisotropy when the fluid compositions were administered using a picotage injection method. [0201] With respect to skin roughness, the results indicate an overall improvement of skin condition from the neck region. In particular, skin roughness of the neck region was significantly decreased by D30 of treatment (median of 16.7%) as compared to DO (median of 13.9%, ρ = 0.0001). No statistically significant difference was observed in skin roughness when the fluid compositions were administered using a picotage injection method. [0202] No statistically significant differences in skin luminance were detected for any of the four regions examined using either the depot injection method or the picotage injection method. [0203] Treatment was well-tolerated with all adverse events related to injection technique rather than to the product. All adverse events were transient, with a mean duration of 4 days, with no sequels. [0204] Regarding questionnaires designed to evaluate physicians’ assessment of treatment, physicians using the depot injection method assessed skin texture (roughness) as “improved” or “very improved” in 88.9% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D15, in 100% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D30, and in 95.7% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D60. Physicians using the depot injection method assessed skin brightness as “improved” or “very improved” in 74.1% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D15, in 87.5% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D30, and in 91.3% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D60. Physicians using the depot injection method assessed skin hydration as “improved” or “very improved” in 88.9% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D15, in 100% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D30, and in 95.7% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D60. Physicians using the depot injection method assessed skin appearance (color) as “improved” or “very improved” in 48.1% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D15, in 91.7% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D30, and in 91.3% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D60. [0205] Regarding questionnaires designed to evaluate individuals’ assessment of treatment, individuals administered the fluid composition using the depot injection method assessed skin texture (roughness) as “improved” or “very improved” in 72.0% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D15, in 94.7% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D30, and in 80.9% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D60. Individuals administered the fluid composition using the depot injection method assessed skin brightness as "improved” or “very improved” in 84.0% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D15, in 84.3% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D30, and in 85.7% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D60. Individuals administered the fluid composition using the depot injection method assessed skin hydration as “improved” or “very improved” in 84.0% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D15, in 94.8% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D30, and in 95.0% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D60. Individuals administered the fluid composition using the depot injection method assessed skin appearance (color) as “improved” or “very improved” in 36.0% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D15, in 42.1% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D30, and in 42.9% of individuals administered the fluid composition at D60. [0206] Regarding questionnaires designed to evaluate individuals’ assessment of injection method, 100% of individuals administered the fluid composition using the depot injection method assessed global aesthetic effect at day 60 of treatment as “improved” or “very improved”, whereas only 14.3% of individuals administered the fluid composition using the picotage injection method assessed global aesthetic effect at day 60 of treatment as “improved” or “very improved.” Likewise, 100% of individuals administered the fluid composition using the depot injection method assessed revitalization of skin at day 60 of treatment as “improved” or “very improved”, whereas only 14.3% of individuals administered the fluid composition using the picotage injection method assessed revitalization of skin at day 60 of treatment as “improved” or “very improved.” Similarly, 78.9% of individuals administered the fluid composition using the depot injection method assessed face fullness at day 60 of treatment as "improved” or “very improved”, whereas none of individuals administered the fluid composition using the picotage injection method assessed face fullness as “improved” or “very improved.” All told, 95% of individuals administered the fluid composition using the depot injection method were delighted with the treatment at day 60, whereas only 14.3% of individuals administered the fluid composition using the picotage injection method were delighted with the treatment at day 60. [0207] Overall, the fluid compositions disclosed in the present specification have significant efficacy on skin hydration on the cheek, neck, and peri-oral regions; significant efficacy on skin anisotropy on the neck and peri-oral regions; and significant efficacy on skin roughness on the neck region. In addition evaluation of questionnaires indicate physician satisfaction of aesthetic results at each visit showed that skin texture, skin brightness, skin hydration and overall skin condition were “improved” or ‘very improved’ for greater than 80% of subjects at Day 60. Similarly, subject satisfaction indicated that skin roughness, skin brightness, skin hydration and number of fine wrinkles were "improved” or ‘very improved’ for greater than 80% of subjects.
