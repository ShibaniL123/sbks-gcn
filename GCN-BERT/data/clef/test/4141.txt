Step 5-4, preparation of trifluoro-methanesulfonic acid 8-(4-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-piperidin-1-yl)-7-(3-fluoro-5-methyl-phenyl)-[1,5]naphthyridin-2-yl ester: To a solution of {1-[3-(3-fluoro-5-methyl-phenyl)-6-hydroxy-[1,5]naphthyridin-4-yl]-piperidin-4-yl}-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (287.4 mg, 0.64 mmol) in DCM (7 mL) at 0° C. was added TEA (0.35 mL, 2.5 mmol), followed by slow addition of Tf2O (0.21 mL, 1.2 mmol). The mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 10 min. The mixture was quenched with water and the organic layer was separated. The organic layer was concentrated and purified by silica gel column chromatography to afford the title compound (151.1 mg, 40.7% yield) as a brown solid. MS (M+H)+=585.3.
