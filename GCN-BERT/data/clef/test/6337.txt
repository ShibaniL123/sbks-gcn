CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/697,631, filed Sep. 6, 2012, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD The disclosure generally relates to cosmetic compositions comprising eicosapentaenoic free acid and gamma-linolenic free acid, and methods of manufacture and use thereof. BACKGROUND Compositions which include free fatty acid components—including those for topical and/or cosmetic use are well-known to develop unpleasant odors. It is believed that decomposition (e.g., oxidation) of the free fatty acid component(s) is the source of the odor. One strategy to avoid odor formation has been to use derivatives of the fatty acids, for example esters, triglycerides, etc. However, preparing derivatives of free fatty acids from source materials is time-consuming, costly, and in some cases attenuates the desired activity of the compounds. On the other hand, offensive odors in personal care products contributes to non-compliance with a recommended treatment schedule. In addition, derivatives of free fatty acids such as alkyl esters are generally much less soluble in aqueous compositions. Especially for cosmetic compositions, then, the decreased hydrophilicity of fatty acid derivatives is undesirable as organic co-solvents tend to be harsher on the skin than water-based compositions. Accordingly, there exists a need for compositions comprising free fatty acids without an associated unpleasant odor. SUMMARY The present disclosure provides compositions comprising free fatty acid agents including, for example, eicosapentaenoic free acid and gamma-linolenic free acid. In some embodiments, the eicosapentaenoic free acid and the gamma-linolenic free acid are present in a weight ratio of about 2:1 to about 8:1, for example about 4:1.

Example 4 Properties of Formulations A to C The color, pH, and viscosity (20° C.) of Formulations A to C were determined according to standard methods, as shown in Table 4, below.

Chromameter measurements are performed on the volar forearm to define each subject's individual typography angle (“ITA°”). Six small spots are then exposed to ITA°-dependent doses of UVA/UVB radiation. After 24 hours, each subject's minimal erythemal dose (“MED”) is assessed. Four test areas are defined on a non-UV-exposed portion of each subject's volar forearm. One test area serves as a negative control, while a composition of each of Formulations A-C of Examples 1-3 is applied to the other three test areas once per day for three days. Two hours after the application on day 3, each test area receives twice the MED dose of UVA/UVB light. After a 24-hour waiting period, chromametric measurements are obtained, and biopsies from each of the three test areas and the negative control area are collected and analyzed. Analysis of the skin biopsies includes determining the content of at least three markers: matrix metalloproteinase-1 (“MMP-1”), malondialdehyde (“MDA”) and interleukin-8 (“IL-8”). Differences between the treated test areas and the negative control are determined using standard statistical methods. Example 6 Effect of Disclosed Compositions on Biophysical Properties of Skin A study to determine the effect of Formulations A-C of Examples 1-3 includes 28 male and female subjects, each age 35 to 50 years. Chromameter measurements are performed on the volar forearm to define each subject's individual typography angle (“ITA°”). Six small spots are then exposed to ITA°-dependent doses of UVA/UVB radiation. After 24 hours, each subject's minimal erythemal dose (“MED”) is assessed. Baseline biophysical measurements are also obtained at this time, including epidermal thickness (e.g., by a Vivascope or similar instrument), skin elasticity (e.g., by a Cutometer or similar instrument), skin hydration (e.g., by a Corneometer or similar instrument), and skin roughness/fine line assessment/3-dimensional structure (e.g., by use of a Phase-shifted Rapid In vivo Measurement Of human Skin—“PRIMOS”—or a similar instrument. Each subject then applies each of Formulations A-C of Examples 1-3 twice daily for 12 weeks. During the 12-week test period, each subject visits a test facility to be exposed to suberythemal irradiation by a defined solar simulator. At the end of the 12-week test period, biophysical measurements as described above are obtained, and skin biopsies are procured. Epidermal thickness, papillary index, and collagen fiber networks are assessed, along with determination of COX-2 and procollagen-1 levels. Differences between the test areas and the negative control are determined using standard statistical methods. Example 7 Effect of Formulations A to C on Skin Roughness Induced by Suberythemal UV Irradiation A study to determine the efficacy of Formulations A to C to prevent drying out and roughening of the skin during repeated suberythemal irradiation with a sun simulator that emits UVB and UVA radiation is performed. The subjects include fourteen male and female humans each having type II or type III skin. During the week before treatment, the minimum erythemal dose (MED) for each subject is determined by irradiating six small spots on the subject's volar forearm with a sun simulator (UVASPOT 1000, Hönle). Dose increments are increased by 25% to detect the MED, which is read 16-24 hours after irradiation. Each subject's volar forearm area is divided into four 4 cm by 5 cm test areas. One area serves as an untreated, irradiated control. A second area is not treated and is not irradiated to serve as a second control. On days 1 to 12, product applications are performed by the subjects with the exception that applications performed in the morning of the days with an appointment at the study site are performed by trained personnel. On each test area, 2 mg per cm2 of one of Formulations A to C is applied by the trained personnel. The subjects are similarly trained by a technician to apply the same 2 mg per cm2 dose. Fifteen minutes after the Formulation is applied, irradiation on the 3 irradiated test areas is performed with the sun simulator. On days 1 and 3, 0.6 MED are irradiated. On days 5 and 8, 0.75 MED are irradiated, and on days 10 and 12, 1 MED is irradiated. In cases of visible erythema on one or more test areas, the irradiation is skipped for the subject on all test areas until no more erythema is apparent. Measurements of skin roughness is performed at baseline and on day 12. Measurements are taken before test product application. Using Phase-shifted Rapid In vivo Measurement Of human Skin (PRIMOS), a three-dimensional surface structure of the investigated skin site is captured. The measuring principle is based on digital fringe projection. The fringes that are projected are detected with a CCD camera. The three-dimensional structure is then calculated from the position of the fringes in combination with the gray values of each pixel. From the captured three-dimensional structure, roughness parameters are calculated. The parameters Rz and Ra are chosen, representing mainly the rough structure (Rz) and the finer skin structure (Ra). An increase or decrease in the roughness parameters corresponded to an increase or decrease in the degree of skin roughness. Measurements of skin moisture (KAP) are performed at baseline and on days 3, 5, 10 and 12. Measurements are taken before test product application. The evaluation is performed with a Corneometer (CM 825) and is based on the capacitatance measuring principle—that is, the distinctly different dielectric constants of water and other substances. This method is described in the literature in detail and is generally accepted as a reproducible and reliable parameter for skin hydration measurements. As standard procedure, measurements are repeated 5 times. Mean values are taken from the 3 middle measuring points; the highest and lowest values are dismissed. By this approach more stable values were achieved. For all parameters, appropriate statistical methods are used to analyze the differences between the test products and the untreated control. Example 8 Perceived Odor of Formulations A to C A study was conducted to determine the perceived odor of the compositions of Formulations A to C as prepared according to Example 1. A small amount of each of the compositions was randomly applied to the back of the hand or wrist of each of four participating subjects. Each subject reported the level of “fishy” odor over several minutes on a Lichert-type scale as shown in Table 5 below. TABLE 5 Odor Levels of Formulations A to C. Low Medium High Formulation Low (Avg.) Medium (Avg.) High (Avg.) A +, −, −, + −/+ ++, +, +, ++ +/++ +++, ++, ++, +++ ++/+++ B +, −, −, + −/+ ++, +, +, ++ +/++ +++, ++, ++, +++ ++/+++ C −, −, −, − − −, −, −, − − +, −, +, + + These study data indicate that the composition of Formulation C surprisingly has a cosmetically acceptable odor (e.g., is free of unpleasant odors), whereas the compositions of Formulation A or Formulation B at the same levels of EPA and GLA free fatty acids.
