Preparation of trans-2-chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)-N-(2,4-difluoro-3-hydroxyphenyl)benzamide (F1203)
trans-3-(2-Chloro-5-(2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzamido)-2,6-difluorophenyl acetate (F1193) (0.067 g, 0.108 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (2.2 mL) and treated with saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (0.5 mL) with stirring at room temperature. Analysis of the reaction mixture after 1 hour by thin layer chromatography (2:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate) indicated that the reaction was complete. The reaction mixture was partitioned between ethyl acetate and 1N aqueous hydrochloric acid, the layers were separated, and the organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate. Purification by preparative thin layer chromatography (20×20×0.2 cm plate, 3:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate) gave the title compound as a tan foam (0.06 g, 96%).
