Botanical/commercial classification: Rosa hybrida/Floribunda Rose Plant. Varietal denomination: cv. Meigremlis. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The new variety of Rosa hybrida Floribunda rose plant was created by artificial pollination wherein two parents were crossed which previously had been studied in the hope that they would contribute the desired characteristics. The female parent (i.e., the seed parent) was ‘The Fairy’ variety (non-patented). The male parent (i.e., the pollen parent) was the ‘Kormax’ variety (non-patented). The parentage of the new variety can be summarized as follows: [in-line-formulae]‘The Fairy’×‘Kormax’.[/in-line-formulae] The seeds resulting from the above pollination were sown and small plants were obtained which were physically and biologically different from each other. Selective study resulted in the identification of a single plant of the new variety. It was found that the new Floribunda rose plant of the present invention: (a) displays a low and compact bushy growth habit with strong vegetation with the plant commonly displaying a well-ordered overall appearance until late in the season,(b) forms in abundance on a substantially continuous basis attractive red semi-double blossoms,(c) exhibits rather dense dark green foliage with a glossy aspect on the upper surface, and(d) is particularly well suited for providing attractive ornamentation in parks and gardens. The blooming tends to commence early in the season, during observations to date. The new variety well meets the needs of the horticultural industry and can be grown to advantage in parks and gardens where attractive ornamentation is to be provided. The new variety can be readily distinguished from its ancestors. For instance, ‘The Fairy’ parental variety forms dissimilar light pink blossoms. The ‘Kormax’ parental variety forms dissimilar red blossoms commonly having only six petals per blossom. This new variety also can be readily distinguished from the ‘Meigalpio’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 17,877) and ‘Noatraum’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 10,084) rose varieties. More specifically, the foliage of the ‘Meigalpio’ variety is less glossy on the upper surface, and the ‘Noatraum’ variety commonly displays a taller growth habit. The ‘Noatraum’ variety is also known as ‘Naofeuer’ in Europe. The new variety has been found to undergo asexual propagation in France by a number of routes, including budding, grafting, and the use of cuttings. Asexual propagation by the above-mentioned techniques at Le Cannet des Maures, Var, France, has shown that the characteristics of the new variety are stable and are strictly transmissible by such asexual propagation from one generation to another. Accordingly, the new variety undergoes asexual propagation in a true-to-type manner. The new variety has been named ‘Meigremlis’. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPH The accompanying photograph shows as nearly true as it is reasonably possible to make the same, in a color illustration of this character, typical specimens of the plant parts of the new variety. The rose plants of the new variety were approximately two years of age and were observed during April while growing outdoors at Le Gannet des Maures, Var, France. Comparative standard color information is provided at the bottom of the photograph.
