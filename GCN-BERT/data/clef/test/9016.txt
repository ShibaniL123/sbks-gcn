FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions, such as vaccines, and methods of making and using such compositions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Vaccination is one of the greatest achievements of medicine, and has spared millions of people the effects of devastating diseases. Before vaccines became widely used, infectious diseases killed thousands of children and adults each year in the United States alone, and so many more worldwide. Vaccination is widely used to prevent and treat infection by bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens, and also is an approach that is used in the prevention and treatment of cancer. Several different approaches are used in vaccination, including the administration of killed pathogen, live-attenuated pathogen, and inactive pathogen subunits. In the case of viral infection, live vaccines have been found to confer the most potent and durable protective immune responses. Live-attenuated vaccines have been developed against flaviviruses, which are small, enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses that are generally transmitted by infected mosquitoes and ticks. The Flavivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family includes approximately 70 viruses, many of which, such as yellow fever (YF), dengue (DEN), Japanese encephalitis (JE), and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) viruses, are major human pathogens (rev. in Burke and Monath, Fields Virology, 4th Ed., 1043-1126, 2001). Different approaches have been used in the development of vaccines against flaviviruses. In the case of yellow fever virus, for example, two vaccines (yellow fever 17D and the French neurotropic vaccine) have been developed by serial passage (Monath, “Yellow Fever,” In Plotkin and Orenstein, Vaccines, 3rd ed., Saunders, Philadelphia, pp. 815-879, 1999). Another approach to attenuation of flaviviruses for use in vaccination involves the construction of chimeric flaviviruses, which include components of two (or more) different flaviviruses. Understanding how such chimeras are constructed requires an explanation of the structure of the flavivirus genome. Flavivirus proteins are produced by translation of a single, long open reading frame to generate a polyprotein, which is followed by a complex series of post-translational proteolytic cleavages of the polyprotein by a combination of host and viral proteases to generate mature viral proteins (Amberg et al., J. Virol. 73:8083-8094, 1999; Rice, “Flaviviridae,” In Virology, Fields (ed.), Raven-Lippincott, New York, 1995, Volume I, p. 937). The virus structural proteins are arranged in the polyprotein in the order C-prM-E, where “C” is capsid, “prM” is a precursor of the viral envelope-bound M protein, and “E” is the envelope protein. These proteins are present in the N-terminal region of the polyprotein, while the non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) are located in the C-terminal region of the polyprotein. Chimeric flaviviruses have been made that include structural and non-structural proteins from different flaviviruses. For example, the so-called ChimeriVax™ technology employs the yellow fever 17D virus capsid and nonstructural proteins to deliver the envelope proteins (prM and E) of other flaviviruses (see, e.g., Chambers et al., J. Virol. 73:3095-3101, 1999). This technology has been used to develop vaccine candidates against dengue, Japanese encephalitis (JE), West Nile (WN), and St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) viruses (see, e.g., Pugachev et al., in New Generation Vaccines, 3rd ed., Levine et al., eds., Marcel Dekker, New York, Basel, pp. 559-571, 2004; Chambers et al., J. Virol. 73:3095-3101, 1999; Guirakhoo et al., Virology 257:363-372, 1999; Monath et al., Vaccine 17:1869-1882, 1999; Guirakhoo et al., J. Virol. 74:5477-5485, 2000; Arroyo et al., Trends Mol. Med. 7:350-354, 2001; Guirakhoo et al., J. Virol. 78:4761-4775, 2004; Guirakhoo et al., J. Virol. 78:9998-10008, 2004; Monath et al., J. Infect. Dis. 188:1213-1230, 2003; Arroyo et al., J. Virol. 78:12497-12507, 2004; and Pugachev et al., Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 71:639-645, 2004). Central to the successful use and commercialization of vaccines is the manner by which they are processed and formulated, to ensure stability and maintenance of efficacy under conditions in which the vaccines are shipped and stored prior to use. Lyophilization is an approach involved in the processing of some vaccine products, and is essentially a freeze-drying process that, under low pressures, removes water through sublimation, and leaves the product as a dried cake with a small amount of moisture. This process can be advantageous to vaccines, including chimeric flavivirus vaccines as described above, because such vaccines tend to be more stable in a low moisture environment. Lyophilization can also increase the storage temperature of the product and make it easier to transport. A critical factor impacting the efficacy of the lyophilization process is the formulation of the vaccine. For example, it is desirable that the formulation, upon removal of water, enhances the stability of the product. Typically, a vaccine formulation will contain any or all of the following components: a bulking agent (e.g., a sugar), a stabilizer (e.g., a sugar or a protein), and a buffer. The development of effective and efficient processing methods and formulations is therefore of great importance to the development of clinically useful and commercially successful vaccines, including flavivirus vaccines, as discussed above. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides compositions including one or more live, attenuated flavivirus vaccines, one or more stabilizers, one or more bulking agents, and one or more buffer components. In one example, the stabilizer is human serum albumin (HSA) (e.g., non-recombinant human serum albumin (HSA) or recombinant human serum albumin (rHA)) (e.g., about 0.05-2.0% or 0.1%). Examples of bulking agents that can be included in the compositions of the invention are lactose (e.g., about 2-10% or 4%) and/or mannitol (e.g., about 2-10% or 5%), while examples of buffer components that can be included in the compositions are histidine (e.g., about 1-20 mM or 10 mM) and/or potassium glutamate (e.g., about 20-80 mM or 50 mM). The compositions can be in freeze-dried form or in liquid form, prior to freeze-drying. Further, the pH of the compositions can be, e.g., 6-10, 7-9, 7.5-8.5, or 7.9-8.1. The live, attenuated flavivirus vaccines included in the compositions of the invention can be, for example, chimeric flaviviruses, such as chimeric flaviviruses that include structural proteins of a first flavivirus and non-structural proteins of a second, different flavivirus. In an example, such a chimeric flavivirus includes pre-membrane/membrane and envelope proteins of the first flavivirus and capsid and non-structural proteins of the second, different flavivirus. The first and second flaviviruses can be, independently, selected from the group consisting of yellow fever (e.g., YF17D), Japanese encephalitis, dengue-1, dengue-2, dengue-3, dengue-4, Murray Valley encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile, Kunjin, Rocio encephalitis, Ilheus, Central European encephalitis, Siberian encephalitis, Russian Spring-Summer encephalitis, Kyasanur Forest Disease, Alkhurma, Omsk Hemorrhagic fever, Louping ill, Powassan, Negishi, Absettarov, Hansalova, Apoi, and Hypr viruses. In specific examples, the first flavivirus is a Japanese encephalitis virus or a West Nile virus, and the second flavivirus is a yellow fever virus (e.g., YF17D). Also included in the invention are compositions including one or more proteins and/or virus-based pharmaceutical products, human serum albumin (e.g., non-recombinant human serum albumin (HSA) or recombinant human serum albumin (rHA)) (e.g., about 0.05-2.0% or 0.1%), glutamic acid alkali metal salt(s) (e.g., potassium glutamate) (e.g., about 20-80 mM or 50 mM), one or more additional amino acids (e.g., histidine) (e.g., about 1-20 mM or 10 mM), and one or more sugars or sugar alcohols (e.g., lactose and/or mannitol) (e.g., about 2-10%, 4%, or 5%). The compositions can be in freeze-dried form or in liquid form, prior to freeze-drying. Further, the pH of the compositions can be, e.g., 6-10, 7-9, 7.5-8.5, or 7.9-8.1. In one example, the virus-based pharmaceutical product includes a smallpox vaccine (e.g., a vaccinia virus or an attenuated vaccinia virus, such as, for example, ACAM1000, ACAM2000, or Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA)). In another example, the protein-based pharmaceutical product comprises a Hepatitis B virus core protein fusion (e.g., a Hepatitis B virus core protein fusion further including one or more influenza M2e peptides). Further, in another example, the protein-based pharmaceutical product includes a toxin or toxoid of Clostridium difficile. Also included in the invention are methods of preparing therapeutic compositions, which involve subjecting a composition such as those described above to a freeze-drying process. This process can involve the steps of freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying. In an example, the freezing step involves freezing at about −50° C. for about 120 minutes. The primary drying step can involve ramp steps including ramping at about +0.1° C./minute to a shelf temperature of about −40° C., holding for about 500 minutes; ramping at about +0.1° C./minute to a shelf temperature of about −35° C., holding for about 500 minutes; ramping at about +0.1° C./minute to a shelf temperature of about −30° C., holding for about 500 minutes, and ramping at about +0.1° C./minute to a shelf temperature of about −25° C., holding for about 800 minutes. In this example, the secondary drying step can involve ramp steps including ramping at about +0.1° C./minute to a shelf temperature of about +20° C., holding for about 800 minutes. In another example, the freezing step can involve freezing at about −40° C. for about 60 minutes. The primary drying step can involve ramp steps including ramping at about +0.5° C./minute to a shelf temperature of about −5° C., holding for about 300 minutes; and ramping at about −0.5° C./minute to a shelf temperature of about −0° C., holding for about 300 minutes. The secondary drying step can involve ramp steps including ramping at about +0.2° C./minute to a shelf temperature of about +30° C., holding for about 600 minutes; and ramping at about −1.0° C./minute to a shelf temperature of about +5° C., holding for about 9999 minutes. The invention also includes methods of preventing or treating one or more diseases or conditions in a subject, which involve administration of one or more compositions of the invention, as described above and elsewhere herein. In certain examples of these methods, the subject is at risk of developing or has a flavivirus (e.g., Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, dengue virus, or yellow fever virus infection), smallpox, influenza, or Clostridium difficile. Further, the invention includes use of the compositions and preparations described herein in the prevention and treatment of diseases and conditions as described herein, as well as for the preparation of medicaments for use in these purposes. In general, the methods are carried out to “prevent” a disease, condition, or infection of a subject if the subject does not have the disease, condition, or infection prior to administration of the material or composition of the invention. The methods are carried out to “treat” a disease, condition, or infection of a subject if the subject has such a disease, condition, or infection. The prevention and/or treatment can be done to reduce the effects that would otherwise be obtained in the absence of administration, or to eliminate such effects. The invention provides several advantages. For example, as discussed above, it is critical to the effective use of pharmaceutical compositions including protein and/or virus components, such as vaccines, that the compositions remain stable under varying conditions of shipment and storage. As is discussed further below, the present invention provides formulations and processing steps that result in the preparation of compositions with enhanced stability. Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description, the drawings, and the claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The invention provides compositions and methods that can be used for the preparation of viral and/or protein-based pharmaceutical products, including live viral vaccines, as described further below. The compositions of the invention include components (e.g., particular stabilizers, bulking agents, and buffers) that, as described below, we have found to be advantageous in the preparation of vaccines, while the methods include steps, which involve lyophilization, that also provide advantages. The invention also provides prophylactic and therapeutic methods employing the compositions described herein. The compositions and methods of the invention are described further, as follows. Compositions of the invention include one or more protein and/or virus-based therapeutic agents, as well as one or more stabilizers, bulking agents, and/or buffer components. A specific example of a composition of the invention is described in further detail below and includes a chimeric flavivirus vaccine, human serum albumin (0.1%) as a stabilizer, mannitol (5%) and lactose (4%) as bulking agents, and histidine (10 mM) and potassium glutamate (50 mM) as buffer components. In addition to this specific example, the invention also includes compositions in which components of these types are varied in identity and/or amount, as described as follows. Stabilizers that can be present in compositions of the invention include serum albumin proteins. A preferred serum albumin protein is human serum albumin (HSA), whether in non-recombinant or recombinant form. An additional example of a serum albumin protein that can be included in the compositions invention is bovine serum albumin. In addition to serum albumins, other stabilizers that can be included in the compositions of the invention are gelatins, such as human gelatin (e.g., a recombinant human gelatin, which may be wild-type or engineered) and porcine gelatin, casein, PVP, and combinations of any of stabilizers mentioned herein (or others known in the art). In the case of human serum albumin, the amount of this component can be, e.g., about 0.05-2.0%, 0.075-1.0%, or 0.1%. Bulking agents that can be present in the compositions of the invention include sugars, such as lactose, sucrose, and fructose, and/or sugar alcohols, such as mannitol and sorbitol. As is discussed further below, in compositions of the invention including mannitol, it may be preferable for this component to be in an amorphous rather than crystalline form. Further, in certain examples, it may be preferable for the compositions of the invention to include combinations of sugars and/or sugar alcohols. In one example, which is described further below, compositions of the invention can include a combination of lactose and mannitol, with the latter preferably being in amorphous form. In one example, lactose is present at about 1-10%, 2-8%, or 4-6% (e.g., 4%), while mannitol is present at about 1-10%, 2-8%, or 4-6% (e.g., 5%). As is noted above, in addition to stabilizers and bulking agents, the compositions of the invention can include buffer components, such as amino acids, which may serve to contribute to the maintenance of, e.g., a particular pH level or range, and/or product stability. One example of a buffer component that can be included in the compositions of the invention is histidine, which may be present in the compositions in a concentration of about, e.g., 1-20, 5-15, or 10 mM. Another example of a buffer component is glutamic acid alkali metal salts, such as sodium or potassium glutamate, which may be present in the compositions in a concentration of about 10-100, 25-75, or 50 mM. Further, the compositions are generally of a pH of, e.g., 6-10, 7-9, 7.5-8.5, or 7.9-8.1. The compositions of the invention also include one or more active, therapeutic components, which can be peptide or protein-based therapeutic agents, as well as viruses, such as live, attenuated virus vaccines. One example of a type of the latter group of therapeutic agents (live, attenuated virus vaccines) is flavivirus vaccines, such as yellow fever virus vaccines. A specific example of such a yellow fever virus vaccine is the YF17D vaccine strain (Smithburn et al., “Yellow Fever Vaccination,” World Health Org., p. 238, 1956; Freestone, in Plotkin et al. (eds.), Vaccines, 2nd edition, W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia, 1995). Other yellow fever virus strains, e.g., YF17DD (GenBank Accession No. U 17066) and YF 17D-213 (GenBank Accession No. U17067) (dos Santos et al., Virus Res. 35:35-41, 1995), YF17D-204 France (X15067, X15062), YF17D-204, 234 US (Rice et al., Science 229:726-733, 1985; Rice et al., New Biologist 1:285-296, 1989; C 03700, K 02749), and yellow fever virus strains described by Galler et al., Vaccine 16 (9/10):1024-1028, 1998, can also be present in the compositions of the invention. Additional flaviviruses that can be present in the compositions of the invention include other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis (e.g., SA14-14-2), dengue (serotypes 1-4), Murray Valley encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, West Nile, Kunjin, Rocio encephalitis, and Ilheus viruses; tick-borne flaviviruses, such as Central European encephalitis, Siberian encephalitis, Russian Spring-Summer encephalitis, Kyasanur Forest Disease, Alkhurma, Omsk Hemorrhagic fever, Louping ill, Powassan, Negishi, Absettarov, Hansalova, Apoi, and Hypr viruses; as well as viruses from the Hepacivirus genus (e.g., Hepatitis C virus). In addition to the viruses listed above, as well as other flaviviruses, chimeric flaviviruses can also be included in the compositions of the invention. These chimeras can consist of a flavivirus (i.e., a backbone flavivirus) in which a structural protein (or proteins) has been replaced with a corresponding structural protein (or proteins) of a second virus (i.e., a test or a predetermined virus, such as a flavivirus; see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,696,281; U.S. Pat. No. 6,184,024; U.S. Pat. No. 6,676,936; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,497,884). For example, the chimeras can consist of a backbone flavivirus (e.g., a yellow fever virus) in which the membrane and envelope proteins of the flavivirus have been replaced with the membrane and envelope of a second, test virus (e.g., West Nile virus, a dengue virus (serotype 1, 2, 3, or 4), Japanese encephalitis virus, or another virus, such as any of those mentioned herein). The chimeric viruses can be made from any combination of viruses, but typically the virus against which immunity is sought is the source of the inserted structural protein(s). A specific example of a type of chimeric virus that can be included in the compositions of the invention is the yellow fever human vaccine strain, YF17D, in which the membrane protein and the envelope protein have been replaced with the membrane protein and the envelope protein of another flavivirus, such as a West Nile virus, dengue virus (serotype 1, 2, 3, or 4), Japanese encephalitis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, Murray Valley encephalitis virus, or any other flavivirus, such as one of those listed above. Chimeric flaviviruses made using this approach have been designated as so-called “ChimeriVax” viruses. The following chimeric flaviviruses, which were made using the ChimeriVax™ technology and deposited with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) in Manassas, Va., U.S.A. under the terms of the Budapest Treaty and granted a deposit date of Jan. 6, 1998, can be used to make viruses of the invention: Chimeric Yellow Fever 17D/Dengue Type 2 Virus (YF/DEN-2; ATCC accession number ATCC VR-2593) and Chimeric Yellow Fever 17D/Japanese Encephalitis SA14-14-2 Virus (YF/JE A1.3; ATCC accession number ATCC VR-2594). Details of making chimeric viruses that can be used in the invention are provided, for example, in the following publications: WO 98/37911; WO 01/39802; Chambers et al., J. Virol. 73:3095-3101, 1999; WO 03/103571; WO 2004/045529; U.S. Pat. No. 6,696,281; U.S. Pat. No. 6,184,024; U.S. Pat. No. 6,676,936; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,497,884. Additional specific examples of chimeric flaviviruses that can be present in the compositions of the invention, and which may include particular attenuating mutations, are described for example in WO 02/072835, WO 02/102828, WO 03/103571, WO 2004/045529, WO 2005/082020, WO 2006/044857, WO 2006/116182, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,589,531. Additional virus vaccines that can be present in the compositions of the invention include smallpox vaccines (e.g., vaccines based on vaccinia viruses, including ACAM1000, ACAM2000, Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA), and Lister, and vaccines based on monkeypox), and Herpes Viruses and vaccines (e.g., HSV-1 and recombinants thereof and HSV-2 and recombinants thereof) (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,115,270). In addition to viruses, the compositions of the invention can also include therapeutic or vaccine peptides or proteins such as, for example, Hepatitis B core protein fusion constructs (e.g., Hepatitis B core proteins fused to one or more influenza peptides, such as M2e; see, e.g., WO 2005/055957), and C. difficile toxoid vaccines (including, e.g., toxoids A and/or B). The compositions described above and elsewhere herein can be in a freeze-dried form, or in the form of a liquid, such as before or after a freeze-drying process. As is discussed in further detail elsewhere herein, the compositions of the invention are particularly advantageous because of the stability of the active components, which is due in large part to the formulation and the process by which the product is prepared, which involves lyophilization. In general, this process includes the following steps: freezing, primary drying, secondary drying, and stoppering. The process is described in further detail below, in the experimental examples, but an example of the process is as follows. In the freezing step, the lyophilizer shelves are pre-cooled to −50° C. Once all trays are loaded, the shelves are held at −50° C. for 120 minutes. In the primary drying step, the vacuum is set to 25 mT, and the following ramp steps are carried out: ramp at +0.1° C./minute to a shelf temperature of −40° C., hold for 500 minutes; ramp at +0.1° C./minute to a shelf temperature of −35° C., hold for 500 minutes; ramp at +0.1° C./minute to a shelf temperature of −30° C., hold for 500 minutes, and ramp at +0.1° C./minute to a shelf temperature of −25° C., hold for 800 minutes. In the secondary drying step, the vacuum remains at 25 mT, and a ramp step is carried out such that ramping is at +0.1° C./minute to a shelf temperature of +20° C., hold for 800 minute. If necessary, the product can be held at +20° C., 25 mT up to 24 additional hours before stoppering. In the stoppering step, the chamber is outgassed with 0.22 μm filtered, dry, nitrogen gas, the vacuum is set to 800 mbar (slight vacuum), and stoppers are pushed into vials. An alternative lyophilization cycle that can be used in the invention is summarized in the following table.

Not applicable filtered, dry, nitrogen gas to atmospheric pressure Thus, the methods of the invention can involve freezing at or to about, for example, −70° C. to −30° C. (e.g., −60° C. to −40° C., or −50° C.). The freezing can be carried out for about 30 to 240 minutes (e.g., 60 to 120 minutes) or longer. The material can then be subject to one or more drying steps, as described herein. In these steps, a vacuum can be applied (e.g., 25 mT) and the temperature can be changed gradually (e.g., 0.1 to 1.0° C./minute, or 0.5° C./minute), over the course of a period of time (such as, 100-1000 minutes, e.g., 200-600 or 300-500 minutes). In the primary drying, the temperature may be raised to or about, for example, −30° C. to +10° C., e.g., −20° C. to +5° C. or −15° C. to 0° C., while in the secondary drying, the temperature may be changed to, for example, +5° C. to +35° C., e.g., 10° C. to 30° C., or 15° C. to 20° C. As is known by those of skill in this art, these parameters (e.g., temperatures, hold times, ramp rates, and vacuum levels) can be changed based on, for example, results obtained. Prior to formulation, viruses (including chimeras) that may be included in the compositions of the invention can be made using standard methods in the art. For example, an RNA molecule corresponding to the genome of a virus can be introduced into primary cells, chick embryos, or diploid cell lines, from which (or the supernatants of which) progeny virus can then be purified. Another method that can be used to produce the viruses employs heteroploid cells, such as Vero cells (Yasumura et al., Nihon Rinsho 21:1201-1215, 1963). In this method, a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., an RNA molecule) corresponding to the genome of a virus is introduced into the heteroploid cells, virus is harvested from the medium in which the cells have been cultured, harvested virus is treated with a nuclease (e.g., an endonuclease that degrades both DNA and RNA, such as Benzonase™; U.S. Pat. No. 5,173,418), the nuclease-treated virus is concentrated (e.g., by use of ultrafiltration using a filter having a molecular weight cut-off of, e.g., 500 kDa), and the concentrated virus is formulated for the purposes of vaccination. Details of this method are provided in WO 03/060088 A2, which is incorporated herein by reference. The vaccine compositions of the invention can be administered as primary prophylactic agents to those at risk of infection, or can be used as secondary agents for treating infected patients. Because the viruses in some of these compositions are attenuated, they are particularly well suited for administration to “at risk individuals” such as the elderly, children, or HIV infected persons. Such vaccines can also be used in veterinary contexts, e.g., in the vaccination of horses against West Nile virus infection, or in the vaccination of birds (e.g., valuable, endangered, or domestic birds, such as flamingos, bald eagles, and geese, respectively). Further, the vaccines of the invention can include a virus, such as a chimeric virus, including a particular mutation, in a mixture with viruses lacking such mutations. The vaccines of the invention can be administered using methods that are well known in the art, and appropriate amounts of the vaccines to be administered can readily be determined by those of skill in the art. What is determined to be an appropriate amount of virus to administer can be determined by consideration of factors such as, e.g., the size and general health of the subject to whom the virus is to be administered. For example, the viruses of the invention can be formulated as sterile aqueous solutions containing between 102 and 108, e.g., 103 to 107, infectious units (e.g., plaque-forming units or tissue culture infectious doses) in a dose volume of 0.1 to 1.0 ml, to be administered by, for example, intramuscular, subcutaneous, or intradermal routes. In addition, because flaviviruses may be capable of infecting the human host via mucosal routes, such as the oral route (Gresikova et al., “Tick-borne Encephalitis,” In The Arboviruses, Ecology and Epidemiology, Monath (ed.), CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fla., 1988, Volume IV, 177-203), flavivirus-based vaccines of the invention can be administered by mucosal routes as well. Further, the vaccines of the invention can be administered in a single dose or, optionally, administration can involve the use of a priming dose followed by a booster dose that is administered, e.g., 2-6 months later, as determined to be appropriate by those of skill in the art. EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLES The experiments described below were carried out in a development program for the formulation and lyophilization of two vaccines, ChimeriVax™-WN (chimeric flavivirus including yellow fever virus capsid and non-structural proteins and West Nile virus pre-membrane/membrane and envelope proteins) and ChimeriVax™-JE (chimeric flavivirus including yellow fever virus capsid and non-structural proteins and Japanese Encephalitis virus pre-membrane/membrane and envelope proteins), but these approaches are included in the invention with respect to the formulation and processing of other protein/peptide and/or virus-containing therapeutic products as well, as is discussed above. Thus, in one example, a formulation of the invention includes 10 mM histidine (amino acid), 50 mM potassium glutamate (amino acid), 0.1% HSA (Human Serum Albumin, USP), 5% mannitol, and 4% lactose, pH 7.9-8.1. In an example of the methods of the invention, lyophilization is carried out as follows. Lyophilizer shelves are pre-cooled to −50° C., and once all of the trays are loaded, the shelves are held at −50° C. for 120 minutes. In a primary during step, the vacuum is set to 25 mT, and the steps include: ramp at +0.1° C./minute to a shelf temperature of −40° C., hold for 500 minutes; ramp at +0.1° C./minute to a shelf temperature of −35° C., hold for 500 minutes; ramp at +0.1° C./minute to a shelf temperature of −30° C., hold for 500 minutes; and ramp at +0.1° C./minute to a shelf temperature of −25° C., hold for 800 minutes. In a secondary drying step, the vacuum remains at 25 mT, and ramp at +0.1° C./minute to a shelf temperature of +20° C., hold for 800 minutes. If necessary, the product can be held at +20° C., 25 mT, up to 24 additional hours before stoppering. In a stoppering step, the chamber is outgassed with 0.22 μm filtered, dry, nitrogen gas, the vacuum is set to 800 mbar (slight vacuum), and stoppers are pushed into vials. The basis for this example, as well as other formulations and methods included in the invention is provided, in part, below. Example 1 West Nile Lyophilization Study with Mannitol/Lactose Formulations (WNPD-045) Experiment In the experiment described in this example, we explored formulations of West Nile with a base of 5% mannitol, 4% lactose, and 10 mM histidine. Complete formulations are shown in Table 2, with the associated glass transition temperatures.

Formulation was done in a BSC. The lyophilization was carried out under the following conditions: ramp at 0.5° C./minute to a shelf temperature of −55° C. and hold for 120 minutes; when product temperature reaches −50° C., hold for 15 minutes; dry with chamber at 150 mT and foreline at 100 mT; ramp at 0.2° C./minute to a shelf temperature of −20° C. and hold for 1034 minutes at 50 mT; and ramp at 0.53° C./minute to a shelf temperature of 20° C. at 50 mT and hold for roughly 862 minutes. This lyophilization cycle was completed in approximately 38 hours. An accelerated stability study was performed on the lyophilized material. A number of lyophilized vials were incubated at 37° C. On days 7 and 14, vials were removed, labeled, and placed at −80° C. for storage. All formulations with potassium glutamate had experienced considerable cake shrinkage after 7 days at 37° C. Formulations without potassium glutamate did not experience this shrinkage. Experiments WNPD-049 and WNPD-051 were PFU assays to determine the stability of the virus in these formulations. All samples were reconstituted with WFI. Results All formulations appeared very similar after lyophilization. The cakes were full and did not appear to suffer significant volume losses. Some cakes had detached from the vial walls, but this appeared to be random among the formulations. Table 3 shows the freezing yields and the yields across lyophilization compared to the Clarified Bulk material used in formulation. Table 4 shows the results of the accelerated stability study at 37° C. TABLE 3 WNPD-045 Lyophilization and Freezing Yields Frozen Days (−80° C.) at Freezing Lyo WNPD-045 Stability at 37° C.

There were not significant losses in the −80° C. storage. These formulations also showed very good lyophilization yields with an average yield of 73%. It should be noted that the cake appearance of these samples was much more uniform than in any other formulation thus far. The stability of the HSA formulations is very encouraging. Both formulations showed <0.5 log loss after 14 days at 37° C. It appears that having potassium glutamate is beneficial to the formulation. The formulations with recombinant human gelatin, rHG-272, did not produce results that were as good as those for HSA, but may improve if the 0.1% concentration is increased. These formulations showed low yields when frozen at −80° C. This supports data seen in WNPD-033 (see below), which had low recoveries after freezing in a rHG-272 formulation. The formulations with recombinant gelatin also showed losses (>1 log) in the stability studies at 37° C. after 14 days. Example II Development of a Lyophilized Vaccine for ChimeriVax™-WN and ChimeriVax™-JE Products This example describes the development and characterization of a formulation suitable for ChimeriVax™-WN and ChimeriVax™-JE vaccines, as well as the development and optimization of a lyophilization cycle for these vaccines. Experimental Procedure and Results Procedures Formulation To formulate bulks for lyophilization experiments, a 1:100 dilution of concentrated ChimeriVax™-WN or ChimeriVax™-JE was executed into the formulation buffer. The formulation buffer composition varied according to the experiment plan. Samples of the formulated Bulk are taken before lyophilization and stored at −80° C. as “pre-lyo” samples. Lyophilization For experiments up to WNPD-070 and up to JEPD-144, lyophilizations were performed using a FTS DuraStop MP system. Beginning with JEPD-145, a Kinetics LyoStar II system was used. Lyophilization parameters were varied according to the experimental plan. 3 mL vials were used for all experiments. Typically, a 0.5 mL fill volume was used, however, a 0.3 mL fill volume was experimented with and will be noted when applicable. ChimeriVax™-WN Plaque Assay A plaque assay was used to assess the viral recoveries of the lyophilization process and the stability studies. Lyophilized ChimeriVax™-WN samples were reconstituted with either water for injection (WFI) or 0.9% sodium chloride for injection. The reconstituted samples were diluted in WN PFU Media. Dilutions were plated 100 μl per well on O-Vero plates seeded at 2×105 cells per well. Plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. and 5% CO2 and then overlayed with methyl cellulose overlay. Plates were incubated for 96±12 hours at 37° C. and 5% CO2 and then stained with 1% crystal violet in 70% methanol. Stained plates are rinsed and then counted. Acceptable dilutions had between 10-120 plaques per well and have a relative standard deviation of <40% for all wells counted for each dilution. ChimeriVax™-JE Plaque Assay A plaque assay was used to assess the viral recoveries of the lyophilization process and the stability studies. Lyophilized ChimeriVax™-JE samples were reconstituted with either water for injection (WFI) or 0.9% sodium chloride for injection. The reconstituted samples were diluted in JE PFU Media. Dilutions were plated 100 μl per well on O-Vero plates seeded at 3×105 cells per well. Plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. and 5% CO2 and then overlayed with methyl cellulose overlay. Plates were incubated for 96±12 hours at 37° C. and 5% CO2 and then stained with 1% crystal violet in 70% methanol. Stained plates are rinsed and then counted. Acceptable dilutions had between 10-120 plaques per well and have a relative standard deviation of <40% for all wells counted for each dilution. Stability Studies Stability studies were conducted at a number of temperatures. Accelerated stability studies were done in a 37° C. incubator. Samples were also kept at ambient temperature (15-30° C.), 25° C., 2-8° C., and −20° C. Time zero samples were stored at −80° C. In some instances, samples were pulled from elevated temperatures on specific days and stored at −80° C. to be assayed at a later date. Residual Moisture Analysis Residual moisture analysis was performed using direct sample injection into a Coulometric Karl Fischer. The testing was done by Acambis' Quality Control group in Canton, Mass. according to US02-FRM-158-02. Differential Scanning Calorimetry Differential Scanning Calorimetry was performed using a TA Instruments Q1000. Liquid samples were cooled to −70° C. and then ramped to 20° C. When higher resolution was necessary, a modulated method was used. These methods produced glass transition temperatures for the formulation buffer candidates. Solid samples were ramped from 0° C. to 120° C. This method was used to evaluate the glass transition temperature of lyophilized material and to determine the storage conditions. Results Formulation Development Overview Formulations were evaluated based on the following criteria: Tg′—glass transition temperature of frozen materialLyophilized cake appearanceLyophilization recoveryStability of lyophilized material at 37° C.Residual moisture of lyophilized materialTg—glass transition temperature of lyophilized material A large number of excipients were evaluated in early formulation experiments. Components initially screened include: sorbitol, mannitol, sucrose, dextran, lactose, glycine, Heatstarch, Pentastarch, PEG 3350, PVP 40K, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, Tween-80, histidine, alanine, HEPES, TRIS, potassium glutamate, tripolyphosphate, and potassium phosphate. Some formulations failed to produce acceptable cakes and had very low viral recoveries (less than 30%) after being lyophilized. Viral recoveries began to improve with the addition of HSA to formulations as a stabilizer. HSA Experiments In experiment WNPD-021, HSA was first used as a stabilizer. Different concentrations of HSA were added to two base formulations. The two formulations were: 1% Hetastarch, 1% sucrose, 0.1% sorbitol, and 50 mM potassium glutamate4% lactose, 2% sorbitol, 10 mM histidine, 10 mM alanine, and 50 mM potassium glutamate and HSA was added at concentrations of 0%, 0.2%, 1%, and 2%. A plaque assay showed the following yields upon reconstitution with WFI. TABLE 5 WNPD-021 Lyophilization Yields Formulation Yield WNPD-021 Hetastarch, 0.2% HSA 40.10% WNPD-021 Hetastarch, 2% HSA 28.06% WNPD-021 lactose/sorbitol, 0.2% HSA 41.33% WNPD-021 lactose/sorbitol, 2% HSA 39.80% Experiment JEPD-018 further explored the effect of HSA as a stabilizer in lyophilized formulation. This experiment used the 4% lactose, 2% sorbitol, 10 mM histidine, 10 mM alanine, and 50 mM potassium glutamate formulation, and examined HSA concentrations of 0%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 1%, and 2%. After lyophilization, samples were stored at 37° C. in an accelerated stability study. Table 6 shows that the presence of HSA greatly improves the viral yield after lyophilization. Samples titered after 5, 12, and 19 days at 37° C. showed remarkably good recovery (FIG. 1). There does not seem to be any significant improvement with HSA concentrations higher than 0.1%, so it was decided to focus on formulations using 0.1% HSA.

Experiment JEPD-080 examined the use of Delta Biologics' Recombinant HSA and Fibrogen's recombinant Human Gelatin (2 strains—a wild type and an engineered). The recombinant Human Gelatin (rHG) products were used at concentrations of 0.5% and 1%. All stabilizers were used in a base formulation of 5% mannitol, 4% lactose, 10 mM histidine, and 50 mM potassium glutamate. The recombinant HSA performed comparable to the non-recombinant, however, the gelatin products generally had poor lyophilization recoveries and exhibited poor stability in studies at 37° C.

Our target pH range is 7.9-8.1 and histidine has a pK3′ of 8.97. Experiment WNPD-033 tested a formulation of 5% sucrose, 0.1% HSA, and 50 mM potassium glutamate, with and without 10 mM histidine. These formulations were lyophilized and put on an accelerated stability study at 37° C. The two lyophilized formulations had very similar yields upon reconstitution (74% without histidine, 87% with histidine), and showed similar stability profiles at 37° C. (FIG. 2). Despite similar profiles with and without histidine, it was selected as a formulation component because of its buffering capacity in the target pH range. Experiment WNPD-045 examined formulations of 5% mannitol, 4% lactose, 0.1% HSA, and 10 mM histidine, with and without 50 mM potassium glutamate. These two formulations were lyophilized and then incubated at 37° C. for 28 days. Samples were taken at 7 day intervals during the 37° C. incubation to create the stability profile shown in FIG. 3. Both formulations had comparable yields after lyophilization (above 80%). The formulation with 50 mM potassium glutamate showed a better stability at 37° C. than that without. After 28 days, there was a 0.26 LOG loss in titer for the formulation with potassium glutamate. Without the potassium glutamate, there was a 0.56 log loss. Based on these data, it was decided to include 50 mM potassium glutamate in the formulation. Selecting Bulking Agents Lactose was first investigated as a formulation component in WNPD-021. This experiment produced encouraging lyophilization yields, shown in Table 5, and lactose was further investigated in JEPD-018 and showed very promising results in accelerated stability studies (Table 6 and FIG. 1). Experiment WNPD-029 elaborated upon these encouraging results. This experiment used a base formulation of 4% lactose, 2% sorbitol, 10 mM histidine, 10 mM alanine, and 50 mM potassium glutamate. The data below reinforced the benefits of using HSA as a stabilizing component. TABLE 8 WNPD-029 Lyophilization Yields and Accelerated Stability Data from 37° C.

Concentrations of 2% lactose, 3% lactose, and 4% lactose were all lyophilized in combination with 5% mannitol, 0.1% HSA, 10 mM histidine, and 50 mM potassium glutamate. This experiment showed that 3% and 4% lactose behaved similarly, but 2% lactose was performed less well in the accelerated stability study (FIG. 4). Since there was no perceived advantage in using 3% lactose, studies were continued using 4% as the lactose concentration. Experiment WNPD-036 compared the following three formulations: 4% lactose, 2% sorbitol, 10 mM histidine, 10 mM alanine, 50 mM potassium glutamate, 0.1% HSA4% lactose, 3% sucrose, 10 mM histidine, 50 mM potassium glutamate, 0.1% HSA4% lactose, 3% mannitol, 10 mM histidine, 0.1% HAS TABLE 9 WNPD-036 Lyophilization Yields and Accelerated Stability Data from 37° C.

It had excellent recovery after lyophilization, and showed only 0.15 log loss in titer after two weeks at 37° C. This was selected as a candidate for further research. It was hoped that the crystallizing properties of mannitol could be used to speed up the lyophilization cycle. Single Sugar Formulations Other experiments explored using these bulking agents separately. WNPD-030 examined formulations containing only mannitol or sucrose. Lactose was investigated in WNPD-047. These formulations were compared to a formulation containing the two-sugar combination of 5% mannitol and 4% lactose from WNPD-045. The stability of the WNPD-045 formulation (5% mannitol, 4% lactose, 0.1% HSA, 10 mM histidine, 50 mM potassium glutamate) fax exceeded that of any of the single sugar formulations. All of the single sugar formulations showed viral titer losses greater than 0.9 log after 14 days at 37° C. The mannitol/lactose formulation only had 0.46 log loss in the same time period. This is illustrated in FIG. 5. Annealing Annealing was attempted in two lyophilization experiments, JEPD-166 and JEPD-172. In these experiments, the vials were frozen at −50° C. and then raised at 0.8° C./minute to −15° C. and held for 180 minutes to anneal. Next, the temperature was lowered at 0.8° C./minutes to −50° C. and held for an additional 120 minutes before starting the primary drying. Both experiments produced excellent cakes. Annealing allowed the mannitol to crystallize, and the cake appearance was that of a typical crystalline mannitol cake. However, the annealed material exhibited poor stability compared to all experiments, which produced cakes without annealing. Annealed samples showed nearly 1.0 log loss after two weeks of storage at 37° C., while non-annealed samples typically experienced losses in the range of 0.3-0.5 log for the same time period (FIG. 6). These data, coupled with the data from the single sugar systems, lead to the conclusion that crystalline mannitol is not beneficial to the stability of ChimeriVax™ products. Differential Scanning Calorimetry confirmed that annealing essentially crystallized all the mannitol. FIG. 7 shows a thermalgram of a 4% lactose solution, which has a glass transition of −32.6° C. FIG. 8 shows that when 5% mannitol is added to the formulation, the glass transition temperature is depressed approximately 6° C. to −38° C. However, annealing enables the mannitol to crystallize and restores the glass transition temperature to the range seen in the lactose-only thermalgram. The disappearance of this glass transition depression confirms that the mannitol has entirely crystallized. Another conclusion can be drawn from these data. Lactose always remains in the amorphous state when lyophilized. Mannitol, in a formulation by itself, will lyophilize as a crystalline material, however, when combined with other sugars, mannitol can be either crystalline or amorphous. Previous experiments have shown poor stability in the following cases: Lactose alone (4%)—in which lactose is amorphousMannitol alone (5%)—in which mannitol is crystallineLactose (4%) and mannitol (5%) Annealed—in which mannitol is crystalline and lactose is amorphous Good stability has only been demonstrated in one of formulations involving these two components. When lactose (4%) and mannitol (5%) are lyophilized without any annealing step, both the lactose and the mannitol remains in the amorphous state. It is therefore either the amorphous mannitol or the amorphous mannitol/lactose combination that imparts superior stability to lyophilized ChimeriVax™. Amorphous lactose alone has proved ineffective, as has mannitol in any sort of crystalline state. Supporting Data for Final Formulation As outlined above, 5% mannitol, 4% lactose, 0.1% HSA, 10 mM histidine, and 50 mM potassium glutamate (pH 7.9-8.1) was selected as the formulation buffer for ChimeriVax™ vaccines. A number of experiments were done to characterize the formulation, and to create and optimize a lyophilization cycle. Liquid Stability Data from WNPD-052, JEPD-072, and JEPD-087 can be examined to show that this formulation provides excellent stability in a real-time −80° C. storage trial. No statistically significant titer losses due to storage can be observed in these experiments (FIG. 9). This formulation should provide adequate stability to the ChimeriVax™ products when stored at −80° C. before lyophilization. Differential Scanning Calorimetry Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the glass transition temperature (Tg′) of this formulation. The FIG. 10 shows a thermalgram from a WNPD-045 sample. This was analyzed using modulated DSC to improve resolution. FIG. 11 is a sample from JEPD-172 that showed sufficient resolution without using the modulated scanning. Both samples show a low glass transition temperature (by midpoint) in the range of −38-−40° C. Moisture Analysis A trend can be seen when comparing the amount of residual moisture to the stability of the vaccine at 37° C. after 2 weeks. FIG. 12 presents data collected from experiments JEPD-072, JEPD-087, JEPD-145, JEPD-147, and JEPD-151, and shows the loss in titer compared to the percentage of residual moisture. Lyophilization Parameters The experiments shown in the Table 10 detail the parameters used in lyophilizing the final formulation. It also captures the viral yields after lyophilization, the percent moisture of the lyophilized cake, the appearance of the lyophilized cake, and 37° C. accelerated stability data from 1 and 2 weeks, as well as the maximum time-point from 37° C. incubation.

JEPD-151 had the highest yield after lyophilization, the best stability after 2 weeks at 37° C., the lowest residual moisture, and produced some of the best cakes from an aesthetic standpoint (FIG. 13). The lyophilization cycle from this experiment served as the model for the technical specifications that were given to the contract manufacturer. Technical Specifications These technical specifications were based on JEPD-151, but hold times were extended to compensate for potential scale issues with a different lyophilizer. These specifications were transferred to Walter Reed Army Institute of Research for contract fill-finish of ChimeriVax™-WN and ChimeriVax™-JE Phase I/II material.

The formulation has been thoroughly characterized, and has shown adequate stability in liquid form, and excellent recovery and stability after lyophilization. Prior to lyophilization, the formulated vaccine can be stored in liquid form at −80° C. without any significant affect on titer. This example also captures the development and optimization of a lyophilization cycle for a 0.5 mL fill in a 3 mL vial. This cycle should produce cakes of acceptable appearance, high recovery of virus (>70%), and low residual moisture (<2%). The lyophilized product has demonstrated excellent stability at elevated temperature, and will likely show no significant titer loss when stored at the storage conditions of ≦−10° C.
