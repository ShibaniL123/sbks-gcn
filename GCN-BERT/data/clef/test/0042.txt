Example 1
(E)-3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((5S,7R/5R,7S)-6-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-7-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetr ahydro-[1,3]dioxolo [4,5-g]isoquinolin-5-yl)phenyl)acrylic acid
Step 1
N-(1-(3,4-bis(benzyloxy)phenyl)propan-2-yl)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropan-1-amine
1-(3,4-bis(benzyloxy)phenyl)propan-2-amine 1a (0.8 g, 2.3 mmol, prepared by a well-known method disclosed in "Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, 2002, 10(4), 1085-1092"), 2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl trifluoromethanesulfonate 1b (671 mg, 3 mmol, prepared by a well-known method disclosed in "Journal of Organic Chemistry, 2005, 70(6), 2372-2375") and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (595 mg, 4.6 mmol) were dissolved in 8 mL of 1,4-dioxane. The resulting mixture was stirred for 12 hours at 90Â°C. The reaction was stopped, and the reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound N-(1-(3,4-bis(benzyloxy)phenyl)propan-2-yl)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropan-1-amine 1c (527 mg, yield 54.3%) as a yellow oil.
