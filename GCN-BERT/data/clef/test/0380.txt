Step 5
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-6-hydroxy-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate
3-(2-((2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylphenol 70e (740 mg, 3.1 mmol) was dissolved in 30 mL of methanol, then (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-formylphenyl)acrylate 1e (1.05 g, 4.6 mmol) and acetic acid (560 mg, 9.3 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was warmed up to 90Â°C and stirred for 12 hours, then the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by CombiFlash flash preparation instrument with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-(2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-6-hydroxy-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahy droisoqumolm-1-yl)phenyl)acrylate 70f (900 mg, yield 65%) as a yellow solid.
