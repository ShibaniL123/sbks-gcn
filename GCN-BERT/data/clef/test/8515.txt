CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/947,858, filed on Mar. 4, 2014; the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND 1. Field of the Disclosure The present disclosure relates to a material spreader for spreading materials from a container onto an open area, such as a field. Normally, materials such as manure or fertilizers are evenly spread over an entire surface of the field using a material spreader. 2. Description of the Related Art In related art, material spreaders such as a side discharge spreader, include a discharge device and a shroud to convey materials from a container of the side discharge spreader and out through a discharge opening. The discharge device may include a plurality of material conveying components that are rotatably secured to a drive shaft. During operation, the material conveying components may rotate about a central axis and swing downward into the material, peeling it off, pulverizing it, and slinging it underhand laterally out the discharge opening. As a result, an even and controlled spread pattern of the material may be achieved. Over time, however, the plurality of material conveying components begin to wear due to use and a gap distance between an end of the material conveying components and the shroud begins to increase. As the gap distance increases, spread performance of the material conveying components decreases. In an attempt to address this issue, the shrouds in related art may include a single pivot to help bring the shroud closer to the material conveying components. However, the single pivot design causes some portions of the shroud to be closer to the material conveying components than other portions of the shroud. In operation, the varying gap distance causes the material conveying components to follow a path that is non-concentric with the shroud. The non-concentric gap distance results in a less than optimal spread performance and accelerates wear on components. Moreover, additional power is required to rotate the material conveying components to compensate for the larger gap distance between the plurality of material conveying components and the shroud. SUMMARY According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a discharge device of a material spreader may be provided with a plurality of material conveying components and a corresponding adjustable shear ledge and adjustable shroud. The adjustable shroud may be pivotably mounted to the adjustable shear ledge and the adjustable shear ledge may in turn be attached to the material spreader so as to be movable along a first axis and a second axis to bring both the adjustable shear ledge and the adjustable shroud closer to the plurality of material conveying components. By providing the adjustable shear ledge, the gap distance between the top surfaces of the adjustable shear ledge and the adjustable shroud can be maintained substantially concentric with the swing of the material conveying components, enabling the discharge device to maintain a consistent spread pattern. Additionally, by maintaining a substantially concentric gap distance, both power consumption and wear of components is reduced. According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a discharge device of a material spreader may be provided with a plurality of material conveying components mounted on a drive shaft that may be adjusted to move relative to a center of a material holding container. A mounting position of the drive shaft may be adjusted by at least one hydraulic system, which may provide a corresponding adjustment of a position of the plurality of conveying components. The at least one hydraulic system may be used with an adjustable shear ledge and/or an adjustable shroud, or may be used with a fixed position shear ledge and/or fixed position shroud. The drive shaft may be adjusted toward or away from the adjustable shear ledge and/or the adjustable shroud, or the fixed position shear ledge and/or the fixed position shroud.

In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 4, the adjustable shear ledge 60 of the discharge device 50 may include a shear top surface 62. The adjustable shear ledge 60 may also include a shearing edge 64. The adjustable shroud 70 of the discharge device 50 may be disposed adjacent to the adjustable shear ledge 60. The adjustable shroud 70 may include a shroud top surface 72. When the plurality of material conveying components 82 are rotated, a portion of the materials located near the discharge inlet 52 may be scooped up by the front surface 84 of one of the plurality of material conveying components 82. Subsequently, as the front surfaces 84 of the plurality of material conveying components 82 nears the adjustable shear ledge 60, a portion of materials is separated and peeled from the remainder of the materials as other portions of the materials contact the shearing edge 64 located near the discharge inlet 52. The portion of the materials may then be guided along the shear top surface 62. After passing along the shear top surface 62 of the adjustable shear ledge 60, the portion of the materials may then be guided along a shroud top surface 72 and then slung underhand laterally out the side of the discharge outlet 54. In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 5, the adjustable shear ledge 60 may include a plurality of reinforcing tabs 66. The plurality of reinforcing tabs 66 may be disposed on an underside of the adjustable shear ledge 60, opposite of the shear top surface 62, in order to provide structural strength to the adjustable shear ledge 60.

In one embodiment, the sensor 90 may be provided to measure a gap distance between the plurality of material conveying components 82 and the adjustable shear ledge 60 and/or the adjustable shroud 70 to determine whether the gap distance is in an appropriate operating range, and to automatically adjust the gap distance using the hydraulic system 120[LJW1]. In one embodiment, a sensor measuring a torque of the material conveying components 82 may be provided to detect whether the discharge device 50 is in an appropriate operating range and to automatically adjust the gap distance between the adjustable shear ledge 60 and/or the adjustable shroud 70 with the plurality of material conveying components 82 using the hydraulic system 120. In one embodiment, each of the mounting members 65 is a longitudinal opening (e.g. slot) that extends towards the shear top surface 62. In this configuration, the adjustable shear ledge 60 may be positioned or repositioned along a vertical axis and a horizontal axis, both the vertical axis and the horizontal axis being perpendicular to an axis of the drive shaft 80. By positioning or repositioning the adjustable shear ledge 60, a gap distance between the shear top surface 62 and the plurality of material conveying components 82 may be adjusted to achieve a desired gap distance and to promote concentricity. In one embodiment, the gap distance may be between 0.05 and 0.25 inches. In another embodiment, the gap distance may be between 0.10 and 0.15 inches. It is understood that the adjustable shear ledge and shroud of the present disclosure is not limited to the particular embodiments disclosed herein, but embraces much modified forms thereof that are within the scope of the following claims. 1: A material spreader for spreading materials from a container onto an open area including a discharge device disposed on a first side of the container, the discharge device comprising: a housing including a plurality of material conveying components, the housing being attached to a sidewall of the container;an adjustable shear ledge having a shear top surface, the adjustable shear ledge being mounted to the container adjacent to the plurality of material conveying components; andan adjustable shroud having a shroud top surface, the adjustable shroud being mounted to the container adjacent to the plurality of material conveying components,wherein the adjustable shear ledge includes at least one longitudinal mounting member, the at least one longitudinal mounting member allowing the adjustable shear ledge to translate along a first axis to bring the shear top surface towards or away from the plurality of material conveying components.
