BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A lubricating additive composition and lubricating composition for lubricating surface providing a method for reducing wear and improving antioxidancy wherein the lubricating composition contains a base oil of lubricating viscosity and a sufficient amount of hydrocarbon soluble Lindqvist polyoxometalate which effectively provides a greater reduction in surface wear or lubricant antioxidancy relative to the lubricant composition deficient of the Lindqvist polyoxometalate. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention generally relates to hydrocarbon soluble Lindqvist ions and their use in lubricating composition to reduce wear or increase antioxidancy in a lubricating composition. BACKGROUND Engine technology requires ever improving performance and the need to reduce wear friction and oxidation at minimal cost. In an effort to meet this need, it has been discovered that a class of polyoxometalate ions arranged in a Lindqvist structure may be used in a lubricating composition to help reduce the deleterious effects on engine components during operation. Polyoxometalate ions have been known since the discovery of the phosphomolybdate ion [PMo12O40]3−, by J. Berzelius in 1826 [Pope, 1983]. Since that time many polyoxometalates have been discovered and fall into several classes of composition based upon size and structure of the polyatomic ion. Of particular interest is the Lindqvist structure, first identified by I. Lindqvist [Lindqvist, 1952]. Lindqvist structures possess the highest level of symmetry of all the various polyoxometalate structures. Polyoxometalates of this structural composition consist of six edge and corner sharing octahedra wherein each octahedron contains a central transition metal atom coordinated to six chalcogens. The six octahedra are arranged in a manner to give the Lindqvist ion an octahedrally-coordinated central chalcogen atom surrounded by six metal atoms, and an overall octahedral geometry. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In one embodiment of this invention, a hydrocarbon soluble Lindqvist polyoxometalate ion is used as a lubricant additive composition. This additive composition may further be added to a lubricant containing a major amount (>=50% by weight, preferably >80% by weight) of base oil of lubricating viscosity. The additive may be used in addition to, or as a partial or total replacement of additives contains sulfur and phosphorus. The polyoxo Lindqvist ion has a core structure comprised of six edge sharing octahedra. Each octahedron contains a central atom represented by a D-Block element from Group 3-12 in the Periodic Table. Each octahedron is comprised of one terminal atom comprised of B, C, N, O, P or S. Each octahedron is comprised of four μ2-bridging atoms to the adjacent metal centers and are commonly, but not limited to O, or S. The six octahedra in combination give the Lindqvist ion an overall octahedral symmetry. The general formula is [M1aM2bQ1cQ2d]q, wherein M1 and M2 are Group 3-12 transition metals, and a+b=6. Q1 is a terminal atom, or ligand. Q2 is a bridging atom, and c+d=19. The charge q is highly dependent on the selection of M1 and M2 as well as the overall oxidation state of the polyoxo Lindqvist ion, and is commonly in the range of −1 to −12, but is not specifically limited to this range. In one embodiment of this invention, the Lindqvist ion is an isopolyoxometalate, wherein M1=M2, and may be selected from transition metals from Group 4-6 and include the elements of Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, or W. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the Lindqvist ion is a heteropolymetalate and has a mixed transition metal composition, wherein M1 is not equal to M2, and a<b. The major metal (M2) may be selected from transition metals from Group 4-6 and include the elements of Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, or W. In a more preferred embodiment, M2=Mo or W. In a most preferred embodiment, M2=W. The minor metal component (M1) is a D-Block element from Group 3-12 and may also include the transition metals of Groups 4-6. Some possible, though non-limiting, combinations of M1 and M2 in a mixed transition metal Lindqvist ion may be Zr/Mo, Zr/W, Ti/W, Mo/W, V/W, V/Mo, Nb/Mo, Nb/W, Ta/Mo, Ta/W and Ti/Mo. Depending on the nature of the Lindqvist ion, Q1 may also be comprised of organic ligands containing electron donating groups comprised of B, C, N, O, P or S, and the ligands are bound to the Lindqvist ion through those groups. Non-limiting examples of Lindqvist ions containing bound organic ligands are (C3H6O)TiW5O183−, CH3ZrW5O182−, and ArNMo6O182−, where Ar is an aromatic ring as defined in U.S. Pat. No. 6,664,408, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The Lindqvist anion may be added to a lubricant composition in the form of a neutral salt, by combining it with cations of elements in Groups 1-12. Preferred, but non-limiting examples are cations of H, Li, Na, Mg, Al, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Zr, Cs, and Ba. To substantially increase the hydrocarbon lubricant solubility of the Lindqvist ions, they may be combined with cations of a first hydrocarbyl substituted amine. An additional amount of non-protonated second hydrocarbyl substituted amines may be added to the Lindqvist ion salt as further solvating agents to the Lindqvist ion. The second amine may be the same or different than the cationic first amine used to form the Lindqvist ion salt The molar ratio of nitrogen, totaling from the cationic first hydrocarbyl substituted amines and the second hydrocarbyl substituted amines, to the molar metal content in the Lindqvist ion, N:(M1+M2), will range from 1/3:1, to 6:1. It would be understood that an even greater ratio than 6:1 of N:(M1+M2) is possible, but would be relatively undesirable due to the cost of using such a large excess of amine A preferred ratio of amine to metal is 1.2:1 to 1:3/4. First and second hydrocarbyl substituted amines used for the solvation of the Lindqvist ions of this invention include monoamines of the general formula: wherein the monoamine may also be a primary amine wherein R2 and R3 are hydrogen, and R1 represents linear, branched, saturated or unsaturated alkyl of 1 to 40 carbon atoms that may optionally contain at least one ether moiety, cycloalkyl of 5 to 40 carbon atoms, aryl of 6 to 40 carbon atoms, or aralkyl of 7 to 9 carbon atoms, where the aralkyl is substituted further by alkyl of 1 to 36 carbon atoms.

In one embodiment of this invention, the Lindqvist ion is added to a lubricant composition substantially devoid of phosphorus (i.e. having less than 0.01% phosphorus) in a concentration of about 1.5-2.5 moles of metal to tonne of lubricant. In one embodiment of this invention, the Lindqvist ion is added to a lubricant composition containing a phosphorus source wherein the molar ratio of phosphorus to metal from the Lindqvist ion is in the range of about 3-100. In one embodiment of this invention, the Lindqvist ion is added to a lubricant composition containing a zinc source wherein the molar ratio of zinc to metal from the Lindqvist ion is in the range of about 1.5-52. The following examples are given for the purpose of exemplifying aspects of the embodiments of this invention and are not intended to limit the embodiments in any way. EXAMPLES Lindqvist ions were prepared according to literature methods described above. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that Lindqvist ions may be derived from a multitude of pathways, and methods may be employed to prepare Lindqvist ions other than those described herein. Methods of preparing Lindqvist ions are not within the scope of this invention. Lubricant additive compositions were prepared containing exemplary Lindqvist ions of this invention wherein the additive composition further contains amine compounds to increase the hydrocarbon solubility of the Lindqvist ions. There is no particular restriction on the amine compound used to solvate the constituting the Lindqvist ions. For these specific examples, the Lindqvist ion was rendered soluble in the lubricating base using trioctylamine (Aldrich Chemical) or ditridecylamine (DTDA); specifically, ditridecylamine—mixture of isomers, available from Nova Molecular Industries Inc., and (C11-C14, branched and linear alkyl) amines, available from BASF corporation as taught for non-Lindqvist ion of molybdenum and tungsten in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,282,838, 8,071,518 and European Pat. No. 0755938. In several instances, a hydrocarbon diluent was also added to reduce the viscosity of the lubricant additive composition. The lubricant additive compositions were then added to lubricating compositions comprising a base oil in amounts sufficient to provide 0.2-3 moles of metal, per tonne of lubricant. For lubricant compositions which also comprise a phosphorus source, the ratio of phosphorus to metal from the Lindqvist ions ranged from 8:1 to 108:1 molar. Samples were tested in a Falex Pin & Vee Block Testing apparatus. The Falex Pin & Vee Block Test evaluates the extreme pressure properties or wear characteristics of a lubricant. The machine rotates a test pin against two stationery Vee Blocks at 290 rpm under a constant 500 lbs. load for sixty minutes while being immersed in the test lubricant. Wear loss is measured as milligrams of wear by differential weight before and after the test. The lubricant is generally considered to fail the test if the test pin breaks before completion of the 60 minutes. Wear properties were also measured using a Four Ball Wear testing apparatus. The Four Ball Wear testing apparatus uses four balls arranged in an equilateral tetrahedron. The lower three balls are clamped securely in a test cup filled with lubricant and the upper ball is held by a chuck which is motor driven, causing the upper ball to rotate against the fixed lower balls. Load is applied in an upward direction through a weight/lever arm system. Heaters allow operation at elevated oil temperatures. At the end of a run, the diameter of the scars on the three stationary balls are measured and averaged. The relative scar diameters from different test lubricants provides a relative measure of anti-wear properties. Tests were run at 1800 rpm for 1 hour at 54° C. under a load of 20 kgf. Lubricant composition examples were tested for antioxidancy at 180° C. using Pressurized Differential Scanning calorimetry (ASTM D 5483). The test measures oxidation induction time (OIT). Longer OIT can be used as an indication of increased oxidation stability. Example 1 The Lindqvist polyoxometalate, tetrahydrogen-μ6-oxo-dodeca-μ-oxo-hexaoxo(tetratungsten divanadium)ate (H4[V2W4O19]) was prepared according to literature methods [Domaille, JACS, 1984]. It was then neutralized with four equivalents of trioctylamine; yielding a Lindqvist ion salt. To this, an additional 4 molar equivalents of ditridecylamine was added as a solvating agent; giving a final nitrogen to Lindqvist ion molar ratio of 8:1. The mixture was then diluted with process oil to give a lubricant additive composition containing 13.9% Lindqvist ion, 1.24% V and 9.04% W by weight. Example 2 The Lindqvist polyoxometalate, tetrahydrogen-μ6-oxo-dodeca-μ-oxo-hexaoxo(tetratungsten divanadium)ate (H4[V2W4O19]) was prepared according to literature methods [Flynn, Inorg. Chem., 1973]. It was then neutralized with four equivalents of ditridecylamine to form a Lindqvist ion salt; giving a final nitrogen to Lindqvist ion molar ratio of 4:1. The resinous salt was further diluted to 36.3% by weight with process oil to give a lubricant additive composition containing 15.8% Lindqvist ion, 1.4% V and 10.2% W by weight. Example 3 The Lindqvist polyoxometalate, dihydrogen-μ6-oxo-dodeca-μ-oxo-hexaoxo-hexatungstate (H2[W6O19]) was prepared according to literature methods [Fuchs, Acta Crystallogr. B, 1978]. It was then neutralized with two equivalents of ditridecylamine to form a Lindqvist ion salt. To this, an addition four molar equivalents of DTDA was added as a solvating agent. The final nitrogen to Linqvist ion molar ratio was 6:1. To reduce viscosity, the mixture was then further diluted with a mineral oil base stock to give a composition of 19% Lindqvist ion by weight, 821 mole of metal per tonne of lubricant additive composition, and a viscosity of 14 cPs at 25° C. Example 4 The Lindqvist polyoxometalate, dihydrogen-μ6-oxo-dodeca-μ-oxo-hexaoxo(molybdenum pentatungsten)ate was prepared by suspending 0.25 moles of MoO3 in 6.00 moles of water and holding at reflux for 3 hours. Then 0.25 moles of ditridecylamine was added, followed by 132.6 g of process oil, and holding at 100° C. for 2.5 hours. To this mixture, 2.5 ml of a 6N sulfuric acid solution was added, and the reaction stirred at 100° C. for 35 minutes. It was then allowed to cool and the aqueous phase and residual solids removed. The resulting solution contained 8.8% Mo, by weight. The polymolybdate product was then reacted with the product of Example 3 in a 5:1 molar ratio of W:Mo. The mixture was heated to 120° C. for 15 minutes, then at 100° C. for 5 hours under vacuum. The resulting lubricant additive composition had a nitrogen to Lindqvist ion molar ratio of 6:1, and contained 17.6% Lindqvist ion by weight, and 802 mole of metal per tonne of lubricant additive composition. Example 5 The Lindqvist polyoxometalate, isopropyloxy-μ6-oxo-dodeca-μ-oxo-pentaoxo(titanium pentatungsten)ate was prepared according to literature methods by reacting the composition of Example 3 with titanium isopropoxide in a 5:6 molar ratio. [Errington, Dalton Trans. 2007; Wei, Inorganic Chemistry, 2001]. The resulting composition contained 20.2% mixed metalate Lindqvist ion by weight, a nitrogen Lindqvist ion molar ratio of 5:1, and 923 mole of metal per tonne of lubricant additive composition. Example 6 The Lindqvist polyoxometalate, dihydrogen-(2-methyl-1-propoxy)-μ6-oxo-dodeca-μ-oxo-pentaoxo(pentatungsten zirconium)ate was prepared according to literature methods [Villanneau, J. Phys. Chem. B, 2004]. It was then combined with ditridecylamine in a single step which both neutralized the Lindqvist anion and added additional solvating amine. The resulting nitrogen to Lindqvist ion molar ratio was 6:1. In this Lindqvist ion preparation, an oxygen at a vertex of the Lindqvist octahedron is substituted with a 2-methyl-1-propoxy group. The mixture was further diluted with a mineral oil base stock to give a composition of 20.1% Lindqvist ion by weight, and 881 mole of metal per tonne of lubricant additive composition. Example 7 The Lindqvist polyoxometalate, μ6-oxo-dodeca-μ-oxo-pentaoxo(tantalum pentatungsten)ate was prepared according to literature methods by reacting the composition of Example 3 with tantalum(V) ethoxide in a 5:6 molar ratio. [Besecker, Inorganic Chemistry, 1985]. The resulting composition contained 22.3% mixed metalate Lindqvist ion by weight, a nitrogen to Lindqvist ion ratio of 5:1, and 952 moles of metal per tonne of lubricant additive composition. Example 8 The Lindqvist polyoxometalate, trihydrogen-μ6-oxo-dodeca-μ-oxo-hexaoxo(niobium tungsten)ate was prepared according to literature methods [F. Bannani, J. Chem. Crystallogr. 2007]. It was then combined with ditridecylamine to neutralized the Lindqvist anion, yielding a complex of pH=4.7. In a separate step, additional ditridecylamine was added which reduced the viscosity of the lubricant additive and raised the pH to 5.7. The resulting nitrogen to Lindqvist ion molar ratio was 6:1. The lubricant additive composition contained 40.8% Lindqvist ion by weight, and 1659 mole of metal per tonne of lubricant additive composition. Example 9 A lubricating composition was prepared using a naphthenic base stock designated as Unithene 100 naphthenic oil, commercially available from Ergon, Inc. of Jackson, Miss. To this base oil of lubricating viscosity, lubricant additive compositions containing exemplary Lindqvist ions of this invention were added according to Table 1. The resulting lubricant compositions contained metal, as supplied by the Lindqvist ions, at concentrations of 1.9-2.2 moles of metal per tonne of lubricant.
