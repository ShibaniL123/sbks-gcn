This provisional application is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. Government Support [0002] This invention was made with government support under DMS-101043 awarded by the National Science Foundation, R21-HL- 115373, ROl-NS-074149, and ROl-NS-052407 awarded by the National Institutes of Health, and W81 lXWH-lO-C-0208 awarded by the Department of Defense. The government has certain rights in the invention. Technical Field [0003] The present disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for fast and reversible nerve block and, more specifically, to systems and methods that can apply a heat signal and an electric signal to the nerve to achieve the fast and reversible block. Back2round [0004] Patients affected with a neurological disorder are prone to chronic pain or spasmodic muscle contractions. Such chronic pain and spasticity can worsen over time without treatment. Drugs or surgery can block undesirable neural activity; however, drugs have a slow time course and may have undesirable side effects and surgery is usually irreversible. An ideal block would be fast and reversible over extended periods. [0005] Kilohertz high-frequency alternating current (KHFAC) provides a promising new technology that reversibly blocks action potentials while still preserving nerve viability. However, nerve block associated with KHFAC is associated with an onset response, during which the nerve fires rapidly for milliseconds to seconds. The onset response can cause brief, but intense, muscle contractions and pain. To improve the clinical utility of KHFAC, the onset response should be eliminated. Increasing neural temperature can induce block (e.g. , due to altered ion channel kinetics) quickly and reversibly. Summary [0006] The present disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for fast and reversible nerve block and, more specifically, to systems and methods that can apply a heat signal and an electric signal (e.g. , a kilohertz high frequency alternating current (KHFAC) signal and/or a direct current (DC) signal) to the nerve to achieve the fast and reversible block. [0007] In one aspect, the present disclosure includes a method for blocking conduction in a nerve quickly and reversibly. A nerve block that induces heating can be applied to block conduction in the nerve. Additionally, an electrical nerve block can also be applied to block the conduction in the nerve. [0008] In another aspect, the present disclosure includes a system that can block nerve conduction quickly and reversibly. The system includes a first nerve block modality that provides heat to the nerve to block the nerve conduction.

[0009] In a further aspect, the present disclosure includes a neuroprosthetic system that can perform a fast and reversible nerve block.

Overview [0036] The present disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for fast and reversible nerve block and, more specifically, to systems and methods that can apply a heat signal and an electric signal (e.g. , a kilohertz high frequency alternating current (KHFAC) signal and/or a direct current (DC) signal) to the nerve to achieve the fast and reversible block. The block can be delivered repeatedly without damaging neural structures, without altering the conduction properties of the nerve, and without producing systemic side effects. [0037] In some instances, the heat signal can provide the initial block during which the electrical signal can cause spurious conduction due to an onset response. After the onset response (e.g. , less than 10 seconds), the heat signal can be turned off and the electrical signal can maintain the block (e.g. , for more than 30 minutes). Advantageously, by using the heat signal and the electrical signal, a nearly instant block can be achieved (e.g. , within a few milliseconds) without the onset response and maintained for an extended period of time (e.g. , more than 30 minutes) without damaging the nerve. III. Systems [0038] One aspect of the present disclosure, as shown in FIG. 1 , includes a system 10 that can provide fast and reversible nerve conduction block. The block can be provided by applying a heat signal (HS) to the nerve by one or more optrodes 20 and an electrical signal (ES) to the nerve by one or more electrodes. By applying the heat signal (HS) and the electrical signal (ES) in combination, the block can be achieved with lower and safer parameters for one or both of the heat signal and/or the electrical signal than either block applied alone. While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that interactions between the heat block and the electrical block can allow the lower and safer block parameters by modulating nerve physiology (e.g. , ion channel function). Applying the heat signal (HS) alone for an extended period of time can cause damage to the physiology of the cell so that it cannot be applied repeatedly for an extended period of time without damage. However, it can be applied repeatedly for the quick block of the onset response of the electrical signal (ES). The electrical signal (ES) can provide the maintained block, but suffers from the onset response. Additionally, the electrical signal (ES) can provide an onset response, which can be blocked by the heat signal (HS). Accordingly, the system 10 can provide a fast block, without suffering from the onset response, that provides the block for an extended period of time without damaging the nerve. For example, the block can be achieved in real time (e.g. , less than 100 ms). The electrical signal (ES) can provide the prolonged block (e.g. , for at least 30 minutes) that is reversible. [0039] In some instances, the system 10 can be employed as part of a neuroprosthetic system (e.g. , as part of a conduction block component) to block conduction in a nerve (e.g. , to control spasticity in a muscle and/or chronic pain). For example, neuroprosthetic system can provide a user controlled spastic muscle block that can be turned off and on in real time to provide instantaneous control of spasticity. [0040] The system 10 is illustrated schematically as a block diagram with different blocks representing different components. In some instances, the components can include a heat generator 12 operatively coupled to an optrode 20 and an electrical generator 14 operatively coupled to an electrode 22. [0041] The heat generator 12 can generate a heat signal (HS) that can be sent to the optrode 20 for application to a nerve. The optrode 20 can include one or more devices that can deliver the heat signal (HS) to the nerve. The heat signal (HS) can provide the fast block of the conduction in the nerve. For example, upon application of the heat signal (HS), the conduction in the nerve can be blocked within one second or less. In another example, upon application of the heat signal (HS), the conduction in the nerve can be blocked within 500 ms or less. In a further example, upon application of the heat signal (HS), the conduction in the nerve can be blocked within 200 ms or less. In yet another example, upon application of the heat signal (HS), the conduction in the nerve can be blocked within 100 ms or less. Additionally, application of the heat signal (HS) does not result in the spurious nerve activity of an onset response (e.g. , caused by the electrical signal (ES)). [0042] In some instances, the heat signal (HS) can include an infrared (IR) light signal, a light signal, a radio frequency (RF) signal, an ultrasound (US) signal, and/or an electrical heating signal. The optrode 20 can include one or more devices that can be used to apply the heat signal (HS) to the nerve. As an example, the optrode 20 can include one or more IR lasers when the heat signal (HS) is an IR light signal. In another example, the optrode can include one or more heating devices when the heat signal (HS) is an electrical heating signal. In a further example, the optrode can include one or more fiber optic devices when the heat signal (HS) is a light signal. [0043] The electrical generator 14 can generate an electrical signal (ES) that can be sent to the electrode 22 for application to the nerve. The electrode 22 can include one or more devices, elements, or components that can apply the electrical signal (ES) to the nerve. In some instances, the electrical signal (ES) can include a direct current (DC) signal, an alternating current (AC) signal, a high frequency alternating current (HFAC) signal, and/or a kilohertz frequency alternating current (KHFAC) signal. The electrical signal (ES) can provide the block for an extended time period. For example, upon application of the electrical signal (ES), the conduction of the nerve can be blocked for 30 minutes or more. The block can be maintained without damaging the neural response, allowing the block to be reversed to enable conduction in the nerve (e.g., within one second or less). However, application of the electrical signal (ES) can evoke an onset response. Accordingly, the heat signal (HS) can be applied to block the evoked onset response. [0044] The optrode 20 and the electrode 22 can apply the heat signal (HS) and the electrical signal (ES), respectively, to the nerve. In some instances, as shown in FIG. 2, a plurality of optrodes 20 and a plurality of electrodes 22 can be separate devices, each arranged near the nerve. In other instances, as shown in FIG. 3, the plurality of optrodes 20 and the plurality of electrodes 22 can be combined within a single device, such as a nerve cuff electrode 26. Although two optrodes and two electrodes are illustrated in FIG. 2, and four optrodes and four electrodes are illustrated in FIG. 3, it will be understood that the number of optrodes and electrodes need not be equal, and could be greater or fewer than that illustrated. [0045] Referring again to FIG. 1, in some instances, the heat generator 12 and the electrical generator 14 can be included as part of a waveform generator 16. The waveform generator 16 can include a control device 18 that can regulate the timing, the strength (e.g., amplitude, frequency, etc.), and/or other parameters of the application of the heat signal (HS) and the electrical signal (ES). In some instances, the functions of the control device 18 can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions can be stored in a non-transitory memory and provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, and/or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer and/or other programmable data processing apparatus, create a mechanism for implementing the functions of the control 18 device specified in the block diagrams. [0046] Different examples of timing patterns or functions that can be employed by the control device 18 are shown in FIGS. 4-6. In each case, the heat signal (HS) and the electrical signal (ES) can provide an instant block without the onset response, an extended block without damaging the nerve, a quickly reversible block, and a block that can be delivered repeatedly without damaging neural structures, without altering the conduction properties of the nerve, and without producing systemic side effects. The heat signal (HS) can be applied at least during an onset response generated by the electrical (ES) to block the onset response. For example, the heat signal (HS) can be applied from 1-10 seconds until the onset response resolves. This allows the heat signal (HS) to provide the block without the risk of thermally induced tissue damage. The electrical signal (ES) can provide the block after resolution of the onset response for an extended time period (e.g. , at least 30 minutes). Upon removing the block, it is quickly reversible (e.g. , allowing conduction in less than 1 second). [0047] In FIG. 4, the heat signal (HS) and the electrical signal (ES) can be applied simultaneously (e.g. , both are applied at ti). The electrical signal (ES) can be a KHFAC signal that can provide an onset response that is blocked by the heat signal (HS). The heat signal (HS) can be stopped when the onset response resolves (e.g. , at t2). The electrical signal (ES) can provide a block over an extended period of time (e.g. , at least 30 minutes). When the electrical signal (ES) is turned off (e.g. , at t3), normal function can return to the nerve instantly or almost instantly (e.g. , within 1 second). FIG. 5 is similar to FIG. 4, except the electrical signal (ES) is applied slightly after the heat signal (ES) is applied (e.g. , at ty). The delay of the electrical signal (ES) with respect to the heat signal (HS) can ensure that the heat signal (HS) has already established the block before the onset response so that the heat signal (HS) is assured of blocking the onset response. FIG. 6 depicts alternating the heat signal (HS) and the electrical signal (ES). As illustrated, the electrical signal (ES) can be a DC signal. As illustrated, the heat signal (HS) and the electrical signal (ES) can overlap in time. Even thought, as illustrated, the amplitudes of the signals remains constant, in some instances, the amplitude of the signals can be sequentially modulated. IV. Methods [0048] Another aspect of the present disclosure includes methods that can provide fast and reversible nerve conduction block. An example of a method 70 that can block the conduction in the nerve is shown in FIG. 7. Another example of a method 80 for controlling the nerve conduction block in FIG. 7 is shown in FIG. 8. The methods 70 and 80 are illustrated as process flow diagrams with flowchart illustrations. For purposes of simplicity, the methods 70 and 80 are shown and described as being executed serially; however, it is to be understood and appreciated that the present disclosure is not limited by the illustrated order as some steps could occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other steps shown and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated aspects may be required to implement the methods 70 and 80. [0049] As shown in FIG. 7, the method 70 can provide fast and reversible nerve conduction block. The method 70 can apply a heat signal and an electrical signal to the nerve to achieve such a block. Indeed, the block can be applied for an extended period of time (e.g. , 30 minutes or more) without damaging the nerve, quickly reversible (e.g. , within 1 second), and delivered repeatedly without damaging neural structures, without altering the conduction properties of the nerve, and without producing systemic side effects. [0050] At 72, a nerve block that introduces heating (e.g. , via a heating signal (HS)) can be applied to a nerve (e.g. , via optrode 20) to block conduction in the nerve. At 74, an electrical nerve block (e.g. , via an electrical signal (ES)) can be applied to the nerve (e.g. , via electrode 22) to block the conduction in the nerve. In some instances, the nerve block that induces heating (e.g. , via the heating signal (HS)) can be applied at least during an onset response generated by the electrical nerve block (e.g. , via the electrical (ES)) to block the onset response. The electrical nerve block (e.g. , via the electrical signal (ES)) can be maintained over an extended time period. The nerve block can be achieved quickly (e.g. , within 1 second) and quickly reversible (e.g. , within 1 second). [0051] One example of a method 80 for controlling the nerve conduction block in FIG. 7 (e.g. , by control 18 device of FIG. 1) is shown in FIG. 8. This example is shown to control the onset response of the electrical signal. In some instances, one or more of the steps of method 80 can be stored in a non-transitory memory device and executed by a processor. [0052] At 82, the heat block can be turned on at a first time. At 84, the electrical block can be turned on at a second time. In one example, the first time and the second time can be equivalent (e.g. , as shown in FIG. 4) so that the blocks are applied simultaneously. In another example, the first time and the second time can be different (e.g. , as shown in FIG. 5), but the blocks are thereafter applied simultaneously. At 86, after the onset response of the electrical block, the heat block can be tired off at a third time. For example, the nerve block that induces heating can be applied from 1-10 seconds until the onset response resolves. This allows the heat block to provide the block without the risk of thermally induced tissue damage. At 88, the electrical block can be maintained while the heat block is turned off. The electrical block can provide the block after resolution of the onset response for an extended time period (e.g., at least 30 minutes). Upon removing the block, it is quickly reversible (e.g. , allowing conduction in less than 1 second). V. Example [0053] The following example is for the purpose of illustration only and is not intended to limit the scope of the appended claims. EXAMPLE [0001] This example demonstrates a fast and reversible nerve block without an onset response using a KHFAC electrical nerve block and an optical nerve block using IR lasers [alternating current and infrared (ACIR)]. Methods Animal Preparation [0054] Unmyelinated nerves of Aplysia were used. Aplysia can be maintained for many hours and have previously been used to define appropriate parameters for optical block in myelinated rat sciatic nerve. Animals 300 to 400 g were used, as their nerves are 4 to 7 cm, with a diameter of 0.5 to 1.5 mm, comparable to rat sciatic nerve. Animals were anesthetized with isotonic magnesium chloride. The pleural- abdominal nerves were maintained in Aplysia saline at room temperature after dissection. All experiments were performed in vitro. Experimental Setup [0055] Suction electrodes were placed on the nerve as shown schematically in FIG. 9. A monopolar suction electrode delivered stimulus pulses (a); a pair of en passant electrodes constituted a bipolar proximal recording electrode (b). Two lasers were placed across the nerve (c); a bipolar en passant electrode delivered the KHFAC block (d). A pair of electrodes served as a bipolar distal recording electrode (e). En passant electrodes were chosen for convenience; preliminary data demonstrated that the cuff electrodes could also be used. Each electrode was filled with Aplysia saline solution before suctioning the nerve into the electrode to preserve nerve viability. An Ag/AgCl wire was inserted in each electrode. Electrical stimulation to generate nerve action potentials was controlled by a pulse generator unit (A310 Accupulser, WPI Instruments) via a stimulus isolator (WPI A360, WPI Instruments). KHFAC block was delivered by a controlled constant-current function generator (Keithley 6221) using a sinusoidal waveform. An inductor (8.2 H) was placed across the function generator outputs to minimize DC leakage. The nerve compound action potential (CAP) was monitored using AxoGraph X (AxoGraph Scientific). [0056] Two Capella lasers [Lockheed Martin Aculight, centered at 1860 and 1863 nm and coupled into 600-μιη multimode fibers (P600-2-VIS-NIR, Ocean Optics, Dunedin, Florida)] were placed between the proximal recording and the KHFAC blocking electrodes {e.g. , FIG. 9(c)). The small wavelength difference between the lasers was due to different wavelength tuning ranges; water absorption coefficients were similar. The two optical fibers were placed on either side of the same nerve cross section to ensure more uniform IR exposure. A typical sheath thickness is about 100 μιη. Since the optical fibers gently touched the nerve sheath, spot size at the nerve surface was 600 μιη. The fiber had a numerical aperture of 0.22 (i.e., a beam divergence of 25.4 deg in air), so the spot was slightly larger at the axons due to divergence and scattering. Since the onset response travels both anterogradely and retrogradely from the KHFAC block electrode, applying the lasers to block the onset response near the proximal electrode allowed the distal electrode to serve as a control for the same KHFAC block. Varying placement of the optical fibers between the KHFAC and the distal or proximal recording electrodes had no effect on the results. Experimental Protocol [0057] Three experiments were performed on three different nerves, using an A-B-A protocol. During protocol A, a train of action potentials was blocked by KHFAC; protocol B added IR inhibition to generate onset response block. Protocol A was repeated as a control. A current just above the stimulation threshold produced CAPs of sufficient amplitude to assess block effectiveness. The minimum amplitude KHFAC waveform at which block was observed was consistently at a frequency of 10 kHz and amplitude ranging from 10 to 15 mA (peak-to-peak). For the two lasers, radiant exposures per pulse ranged from 0.177 to 0.254 J/cm2. Both lasers were switched on at the same time and emitted laser light for 30 s before the KHFAC waveform was applied, using 200- μ8 pulses at 200 Hz, to allow the temperature to reach a higher value. Nerve health was assessed before and after every experiment by comparing the propagating CAPs traveling down the length of the nerve. Results [0058] FIG. 10 shows that application of KHFAC induced both an onset response (1002), and that it completely blocked the CAP (1004), which returns after KHFAC was turned off (1006). [0059] When only KHFAC is applied (FIGS. 11 (a) and 11 (b), left panels), the onset response is visible in both the proximal and distal recordings. When IR is also applied, the onset response is blocked in the proximal recording only (FIGS. 11(a) and 11(b), middle panels, shaded rectangles). The onset response was still present at the distal recording because the onset response's propagation to that electrode was unaffected by the laser (Figs. 9(d) and 9(e)). Although the onset response was present in the distal recording, the CAP was blocked by the laser (FIG. 11(c)). The onset response reappeared proximally as soon as the laser was turned off (FIGS. 11(a) and 11(b), right panels). After ACIR, CAPs were triggered and had the same amplitude as before ACIR, demonstrating its reversibility. ACIR produced complete onset response block in each experiment (N ¼ 3). The onset response, which has previously been shown to be variable over time, was not identical before, during, and after block, but the block of the onset response was always complete.
