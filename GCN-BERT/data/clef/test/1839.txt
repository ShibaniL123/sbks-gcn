Technical Field The present invention relates to a polyester resin composition capable of suppressing generation of a highly toxic gas upon production of the composition. Background Art Polyester resins have been extensively used in the application fields such as films and sheets because they are excellent in transparency, mechanical strength, melting stability, solvent resistance and recyclability. Further, in recent years, the polyester resins have also been used for housings of domestic appliances or OA equipments. However, the polyester resins tend to readily undergo hydrolysis as compared to conventional general-purpose resins. For this reason, for the purpose of improving a hydrolysis resistance of the polyester resins, an aromatic carbodiimide has been conventionally added thereto. For example, PTL1 discloses an aliphatic polyester resin composition that is improved in hydrolysis resistance by compounding an aromatic monocarbodiimide compound into an aliphatic polyester resin such as a polylactic acid. Citation List Patent Literature PTL1: WO 2008/010355A Summary of Invention Technical Problem In the polyester resin composition disclosed in PTL1 which is obtained by mixing the polyester resin and the aromatic carbodiimide, it is possible to suppress hydrolysis of the polyester resin. However, when mixing the polyester resin and the aromatic carbodiimide, there tends to occur such a problem that if these compounds are mixed at a temperature not lower than a melting temperature of the polyester resin, a carboxy group of the polyester resin is reacted with a carbodiimide group of the aromatic monocarbodiimide during the mixing to cause decomposition of the aromatic monocarbodiimide, so that a large amount of a highly toxic gas derived from an isocyanate group is generated, thereby causing deterioration in working environments and safety. The present invention has been accomplished in view of the above conventional problem. Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a polyester resin composition that is capable of suppressing generation of a highly toxic gas when mixing a polyester resin and an aromatic carbodiimide at a temperature not lower than a melting temperature of the polyester resin, in order to improve a hydrolysis stability of the polyester resin. Solution to Problem As a result of the present inventors' earnest and intense studies on technologies for suppressing generation of the highly toxic gas, it has been found that a polyester resin composition including a polyester resin and an aromatic carbodiimide, and further an aliphatic polycarbodiimide, can be prevented from suffering from generation of a highly toxic decomposed gas derived from the aromatic carbodiimide, to a considerable extent. Thus, in an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a polyester resin composition including a polyester resin (A), an aromatic carbodiimide (B) and an aliphatic polycarbodiimide (C), the polyester resin (A) being a polyester resin (a-1) produced from an aliphatic polycarboxylic acid and a dialkyl ester thereof, or an aliphatic polycarboxylic acid anhydride, and an aliphatic polyol, a polyester resin (a-2) produced from an aromatic polycarboxylic acid and a dialkyl ester thereof, or an aromatic polycarboxylic acid anhydride, and an aliphatic polyol, a polyester resin (a-3) produced from 3-hydroxyalkanoic acid, polyethylene terephthalate (a-4), or a polyester resin (a-5) constituted of a copolymer of the polyester resins (a-1) and (a-2).

That is, the mechanism of suppressing generation of a toxic gas derived from an isocyanate group is considered to be that a carboxy group present in the polyester resin (A) is preferentially reacted with a carbodiimide group of the aliphatic polycarbodiimide (C) having a high reactivity, so that substantially a whole amount of the aromatic carbodiimide (B) remains as such in the polyester resin (A) without reacting with the carboxy group of the polyester resin (A), and further since the aliphatic polycarbodiimide (C) is free from decomposition by the reaction with the polyester resin (A), generation of a large amount of a highly toxic gas can be inhibited. Therefore, from the viewpoint of effectively suppressing generation of a toxic gas, the order of mixing of the respective components is preferably controlled such that the polyester resin (A) and the aromatic carbodiimide (B) are mixed in the presence of the aliphatic polycarbodiimide (C). As the specific mixing method concerning the mixing order of the respective components, there may be mentioned a method in which the component (A) is mixed with the component (B) and the component (C) at the same time, a method in which after mixing the components (A) and (C), the resulting mixture is mixed with the component (B), and a method in which after mixing the components (A) and (C) and mixing the components (B) and (C), respectively, the resulting mixtures are mixed together. Further, there may also be used a method in which a master batch prepared by compounding the component (B) or the component (C) solely or both the component (B) and the component (C) into the component (A) is used and mixed in place of the component (B) or the component (C). Of these methods, from the viewpoint of a high production efficiency, preferred are the method in which the component (A) is mixed with the component (B) and the component (C) at the same time, and the method in which after mixing the components (A) and (C), the resulting mixture is mixed with the component (B), and more preferred is the method in which after mixing the components (A) and (C), the resulting mixture is mixed with the component (B). <Applications> The polyester resin composition of the present invention can be processed into molded articles used in the application fields such as electric and electronic equipments such as housings for electrical appliances, building materials, automobile parts, sundries, medical products, agricultural products, etc., by an injection molding method, a film forming method, a blow molding method, a foam molding method or the like. <Molding Method> The method of molding the polyester resin composition of the present invention is not particularly limited, and there may be adopted any suitable molding methods that are necessary to produce ordinary electric and electronic equipments, including known molding methods such as an injection molding method, an injection compression molding method and a compression molding method. The temperature used upon melting and mixing or upon molding in these methods may be adjusted to not lower than a melting temperature of the polyester resin.

It should be noted, however, that the following Examples, etc., are only illustrative and not intended to limit the invention thereto. Synthesis Example 1: Production of Aliphatic Polycarbodiimide A reaction vessel equipped with a reflux condenser and a stirrer was charged with 100 parts by mass of 4,4'-dicyclohexylmethane diisocyanate and 0.5 part by mass of a carbodiimidation catalyst (3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-phospholene-1-oxide), and the contents of the reaction vessel were stirred at 185°C in a nitrogen gas flow for 15 h, thereby obtaining an isocyanate-terminated poly-4,4'-dicyclohexylmethane carbodiimide. As a result of subjecting the resulting reaction product to measurement of infrared (IR) absorption spectrum, it was confirmed that an absorption peak attributed to a carbodiimide group at a wavelength of about 2150 cm-1 was observed. In addition, as a result of measurement of a percentage (%) of NCO in the reaction product, it was confirmed that the NCO percentage (%) was 4.88% (polymerization degree: 6.7). Next, the resulting isocyanate-terminated poly-4,4'-dicyclohexylmethane carbodiimide was heated to 120°C, and then 40 parts by mass of polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (average molecular weight: 400) was added thereto, and the resulting mixture was heated to 150°C and reacted at that temperature for 5 h while stirring. The resulting reaction mixture was subjected to measurement of infrared (IR) absorption spectrum, and after confirming dissipation of IR absorption of an isocyanate group at a wavelength of 2200 to 2300 cm-1, the reaction product was taken out of the reaction vessel, and cooled to room temperature, thereby obtaining a light-yellow transparent viscous aliphatic polycarbodiimide. <Examples in which Components (A), (B) and (C) are Mixed at the Same Time> Example 1 One hundred parts by mass of a PET resin "TRN-8550FF" available from Teijin Chemicals Ltd., was melted at 270°C using a Lab Mixer, and then 1 part by mass of the aliphatic polycarbodiimide obtained in Synthesis Example 1 and 1 part by mass of "STABAXOL 1LF" (aromatic monocarbodiimide) available from Rhein Chemie were added thereto at the same time, and the resulting mixture was mixed for 2.5 min.
