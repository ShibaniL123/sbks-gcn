TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to an ion conductor which has excellent ion conductivity and high electrochemical stability. BACKGROUND ART With the recent rapid spread of information processing-related devices and communication devices such as personal computers, video cameras, and mobile phones, importance placed on developments of batteries used as power sources for the above-mentioned devices has been increasing. Further, in the industry fields such as automobile industry, developments of batteries having high output and high capacity for electric vehicles or hybrid cars have been made. Currently, lithium batteries are attracting attentions from a viewpoint that they have high energy density among the various batteries. The lithium batteries currently available in the market use a liquid electrolyte containing a flammable organic solvent. As such, they require installation of a safety device to inhibit the temperature rise at the time of short circuit or improvement in technical structure or materials to inhibit short circuit. In contrast thereto, a lithium battery having its battery all solidified by changing the liquid electrolyte to a solid electrolyte layer does not use a flammable organic solvent in the battery. Accordingly, it is possible to simplify the safety device and thereby thought to be good in production cost and productivity. As the ion conductor (solid electrolyte material), an ion conductor having a spinel structure is known. The spinel structure is a structure represented by a general formula AB2X4, in which “X” is an anion of 16th and 17th group elements (such as O2−, S2−, and Cl−); “B” is a metal cation provided to an octa-hedral site (such as Al3+, Mn3+, and Ti4+); and “A” is a metal cation provided to a tetra-hedral site (such as Li+, Mg2+, Zn2+. Active researches have been made on the ion conductor having the spinel structure. For example, Patent Document 1 discloses the ion conductor which is represented by Li2xZn1−x(Al2)O4. Further, an ion conductor which has an inverse-spinel structure is known. For example, Non-Patent Documents 1 to 3 disclose the ion conductor containing Cl− as an anion.

This ion conductor has a problem that it is structurally difficult for the Li ion to move because the ion conductor has its x number (s) of Zn2+ substituted by double numbers of 2x of Li+, so that its Li ion conductivity becomes low. Further, ion conductors which contain Cl− as an anion are disclosed in the Non-Patent Documents 1 to 3, but such materials have problems of having low electrochemical stability and being poor in practicality. The present invention was attained in view of the above-mentioned problems, and a main object thereof is to provide an ion conductor which has excellent ion conductivity and high electrochemical stability. Means for Solving the Problems To resolve the above-mentioned problems, the present invention provides an ion conductor represented by a general formula: (AxM1−x−yM′y)Al2O4 (“A” is a monovalent metal, “M” is a bivalent metal, “M′” is a trivalent metal, and “x” and “y” satisfy relations: 0<x<1, 0<y<1, and x+y<1) and having a spinel structure. In the present invention, the ion conductor has a structure where (x+y) numbers of M2+ are substituted by x number (s) of A+ and y number (s) of M′3+. Thus, it is structurally easy for A ions to move and the ion conductivity becomes excellent. Accordingly, the ion conductor of the present invention is better in its structure compare to that of Li2xZn1−x(Al2O4 which has a structure where x number (s) of Zn2+ is substituted by double numbers of 2x of Li+. Further, because the ion conductor of the present invention contains O2− as an anion, it has an advantage of having higher electrochemical stability compare to an ion conductor which contains Cl− as an anion.

In the above-mentioned invention, it is preferable that the solid electrolyte layer contains the ion conductor, and at least one of the cathode active material and the anode active material has the spinel structure. As the ion conductor contained in the solid electrolyte layer has the spinel structure and the active material contained in the active material layer also has the spinel structure, it is possible to reduce the interface resistance between the solid electrolyte layer and the active material layer. In the above-mentioned invention, it is preferable that the ion conductor is a Li ion conductor, the cathode active material which has the spinel structure is LiMn2O4, and the anode active material which has the spinel structure is Li4Ti5O12.

PREFERRED MODE OF THE INVENTION Hereinafter, an ion conductor and a solid state battery of the present invention will be explained in detail. A. Ion Conductor First, an ion conductor of the present invention will be explained. The ion conductor of the present invention is represented by a general formula: (AxM1−x−yM′y)Al2O4 (“A” is a monovalent metal, “M” is a bivalent metal, “M′” is a trivalent metal, and “x” and “y” satisfy relations: 0<x<1, 0<y<1, and x+y<1) and having a spinel structure. According to the present invention, because the ion conductor has a structure where (x+y) numbers of M2+ is substituted by x number (s) of A+ and y number (s) of M′3+, it is structurally easy for the A ions to move, and thus, the ion conductivity becomes excellent. Accordingly, the ion conductor of the present invention is better in its structure compare to that of Li2xZn1−x(Al2)O4 which has a structure where x number (s) of Zn2+ is substituted by double numbers of 2x of Li+. Further, because the ion conductor of the present invention contains O2− as an anion, it has an advantage of having higher electrochemical stability compare to an ion conductor which contains Cl− as an anion. Further, from the view point of ion conductivity, the existence of a free site in a crystal is important. Here, it is possible to modify a spinel structure represented by a general formula AB2X4 with a spinel structure represented by a general formula A1+xB2X4. However, in this case, since A cation is provided to the fee octa-hedral site, it is possible that the ion conductivity as a whole lowers. In contrast thereto, in the present invention, it is possible to keep a fee site (s) important for ion conductivity because the present invention has the above-mentioned general formula. Moreover, in general, it is essential for an ion conductor to have insulation properties when an ion conductor is used as a solid electrolyte material of a solid electrolyte layer of a battery. In contrast thereto, with the ion conductor of the present invention, it is easy to obtain an ion conductor having excellent insulation properties because a generally well-known insulating material can be used therein as a starting material. The ion conductor of the present invention is represented by a general formula: (AxM1−x−yM′y)Al2O4 (“A” is a monovalent metal, “M” is a bivalent metal, “M′” is a trivalent metal, and “x” and “y” satisfy relations: 0<x<1, 0<y<1, and x+y<1). In the above-mentioned general formula, the “A” is a monovalent metal which functions as a mobile cation. As examples of “A”, Li+, Na+, and K+ are cited, and Li+ and Na+ are preferable and Li+ is more preferable. Further, in the above-mentioned general formula, the “M” is a bivalent metal which functions as a structural cation. The “M” is not particularly limited as long as it is a bivalent metal and may be an alkaline-earth metal, a transition metal, or a metalloid. It is preferable that the “M” is specifically at least one selected from the group consisting of: Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+, and is more preferable to be at least one of Mg2+ and Zn2+. Further, in the above-mentioned general formula, the “M′” is a trivalent metal which functions as a framework cation. Moreover, the “M′” is not particularly limited as long as it is a trivalent metal and may be a transition metal or a metalloid. It is preferable that the “M′” is specifically at least one selected from the group consisting of Al3+, B3+, Ga3+, In3+, Sc3+, and Y3+; is more preferable to be at least one of selected from the group consisting of Al3+, B3+, Ga3+, and In3+; and is further more preferable to be Al3+. In the above-mentioned general formula, “x” generally satisfy the relation 0<x. Further, “x” generally satisfy the relation x<1, preferably satisfy the relation x<0.5, and more preferably satisfy the relation x≦0.40, and even more preferably satisfy the relation x≦0.25. In the above-mentioned general formula, “y” generally satisfy the relation 0<y. Further, “y” generally satisfy the relation y<1, preferably satisfy the relation y<0.5, and more preferably satisfy the relation y≦0.40, and even more preferably satisfy the relation x≦0.25. Further, “x+y” generally satisfy the relation x+y<1 in the above-mentioned general formula. Moreover, “x” and “y” may be the same of different. It is preferable that “x” and “y” establish a relation (x=y) because electroneutrality is maintained easily. In other words, even when double x numbers of M (bivalent metal) is substituted by x number (s) of A (monovalent metal) and x numbers of M′ (trivalent metal), the electroneutrality is maintained. Still further, when a relation of M=Mg2++Zn2+ is established in the above-mentioned general formula for example, the general formula can be represented by (Ax(MgαZn1−α)1−x−yM′y)Al2O4. Here, a generally satisfy the relation 0<α<1. One of the characteristics of the ion conductor of the present invention is to have the spinel structure. The spinel structure in the ion conductor of the present invention is decided by, for example, an X-ray diffraction (XRD). Further, the ion conductor of the present invention is not particularly limited as long as it has the spinel structure, but it is preferably be polycrystal, and most preferably and ideally be single crystal. Thereby no resistance increase in crystal grain boundary is caused. The ion conductor of the present invention can exhibit sufficiently excellent ion conductivity even if the conductor is of polycrystal because it has three-dimensional ion conductivity. Further, a shape of the ion conductor is not particularly limited. For example, a particle-form can be cited, and in particular, a sphere-form or an oval sphere-form is preferable. When the ion conductor is in sphere-form, the average particle diameter is, for example, preferably within the range of 0.1 μm to 50 μm. Further, when the ion conductor of the present invention is a Li ion conductor, a Li ion conductivity of the Li ion conductor (25° C.) is, for example, preferably 1×10−7 S/cm or higher and more preferably 1×10−5 S/cm or higher. Moreover, an electron conductance of the Li ion conductor (25° C.) is, for example, preferably 1×10−12 S/cm or lower and more preferably lower than the measurement limit. B. Solid State Battery Next, a solid state battery of the present invention will be explained. The solid state battery of the present invention comprises: a cathode active material layer containing a cathode active material, an anode active material layer containing an anode active material, and a solid electrolyte layer formed between the cathode active material layer and the anode active material layer, wherein at least one of the cathode active material layer, the anode active material layer, and the solid electrolyte layer has the above-mentioned ion conductor. According to the present invention, by using the above-mentioned ion conductor, it is possible to obtain a solid state battery having excellent output characteristics and high electrochemical stability. FIG. 1 is a cross-schematic view illustrating one example of the solid state battery of the present invention. A solid state battery 10 shown in FIG. 1 comprises: a cathode active material layer 1 containing a cathode active material, an anode active material layer 2 containing an anode active material, a solid electrolyte layer 3 formed between the cathode active material layer 1 and the anode active material layer 2, a cathode current collector 4 collecting currents from the cathode active material layer 1, an anode current collector 5 collecting currents of the anode active material layer 2, and a battery case 6 for storing those members. A main characteristic of the solid state battery of the present invention is that at least one of the cathode active material layer 1, the anode active material layer 2, and solid electrolyte layer 3 contains the ion conductor explained in the above-section “A. ion conductor”. In particular, in the present invention, it is preferable that the solid electrolyte layer contains the above-mentioned ion conductor, and at least one of the cathode active material and the anode active material has the spinel structure. Thereby, it becomes possible to reduce the interface resistance between the solid electrolyte layer and the active material layer. In the present invention, by uniformly-applying the spinel structure, it becomes possible to continuously form the ion conductive path and lower the interface resistance. Further, from a view point of lowering the interface resistance, it is preferable that both of the cathode active material and the anode active material have spinel structures. Thereby, the ion conductive path is continuously formed through the whole battery and it is possible to obtain a high output solid battery. Further, FIG. 2 is an explanatory diagram explaining the difference between a typical solid state battery of the present invention and the solid state battery described in the Patent Document 1 (U.S. Pat. No. 4,507,371). Each materials of the present invention explained in FIG. 2 are mere examples. Firstly, in terms of the cathode active material layer, Lix(Cr2)S4 disclosed in the Patent Document 1 does not explain its synthesis process so that it is impossible to synthesize it. As such, one cannot judge whether or not the material functions as an active material for the battery. In contrast thereto, LiMn2O4 of the present invention is an active material having a generally well-known spinel structure. Similarly thereto, LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 is an active material having a generally well-known spinel structure and is known as an active material having a high potential. Next, in terms of the solid electrolyte layer, the three materials disclosed in the Patent Document 1 do not explain their synthesis processes so that it is impossible to synthesize them. As such, one cannot judge whether or not the materials function as solid electrolyte materials. In particular, although Li2xZn1−x(Al2)O4 is similar to the above-mentioned ion conductor of the present invention, it has x number(s) of Zn2+ substituted by double number of 2x numbers of Li so that it is difficult for Li ions to move and its Li ion conductivity becomes low. In contrast thereto, it is actually possible to synthesis the ion conductor of the present invention and an electrochemical activity (such as ion conductivity) thereof is confirmed. Moreover, the ion conductor of the present invention has a structure where (x+y) numbers of M2+ is substituted by x number (s) of A+ and y number(s) of M′3+ so that it has an advantage that it is structurally easy for A ions to move. Further next, in terms of the anode active material layer, LixFe(Fe2)O4 and Lix(Ti2)O4 recited in the Patent Document 1 function as the anode active materials. On the other hand, Lix(Cr2)S4 recited in the Patent Document 1 does not explain its synthesis process so that it is impossible to synthesize it. As such, one cannot judge whether or not it functions as an active material of the battery. In contrast thereto, Li4Ti5O12 of the present invention is an active material having a generally well-known spinel structure. As it is an oxide, it has excellent heat-resistance. Hereinafter, the solid state battery of the present invention will be explained by its structure. 1. Solid Electrolyte Layer First, the solid electrolyte layer of the present invention will be explained. The solid electrolyte layer of the present invention comprises a solid electrolyte material which has ion conductivity. In the present invention, it is preferable that the solid electrolyte layer contains the above-mentioned ion conductor as the solid electrolyte material. Further, the solid electrolyte layer preferable contains the above-mentioned ion conductor by 30% weight or more, more preferably by 50% by weight or more, and further more preferably by 70% by weight or more. In particular, in the present invention, it is preferable that the solid electrolyte layer is constituted by the above-mentioned ion conductor only. Thereby, it becomes easy to form an ion conductive path. The solid electrolyte layer may contain other solid electrolyte material(s) apart from the above-mentioned ion conductor. A thickness of the solid electrolyte layer is not particularly limited. For example, the thickness is preferably within the range of 0.1 μm to 1000 μm, and further preferably within the range of 0.1 μm to 300 μm. 2. Cathode Active Material Layer Next, a cathode active material layer of the present invention will be explained. The cathode active material layer of the present invention contains at least a cathode active material. Further, the cathode active material layer may further contain at least one of the solid electrolyte material and a conductive material. As examples of the cathode active material, an active material having a spinel structure, an active material having a rock salt structure, and an active material having an olivine structure can be cited. Among them, the active material having a spinel structure is preferable. Thereby, for example, when a solid electrolyte layer contains the above-mentioned ion conductor (the ion conductor having a spinel structure), an ion conductive path is continuously formed between the cathode active material layer and the solid electrolyte layer so that it becomes possible to reduce the interface resistance between two layers. As an example of the active material which has a spinel structure and which can be used for a lithium solid state battery, an active material that satisfies the general formula LiaMbOc (“M” is at least one of the transition metal element, “a” to “c” satisfy relations: 0<x≦2.0, 1.5≦b≦2.5, and 3≦c≦5). Further, “N” is at least one selected from the group consisting of Mn, Co, and Ni. As specific examples of the active material having a spinel structure, LiMn2O4, LiCoMnO4, LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, LiCo0.5Mn1.5O4, LiFe0.5Mn1.5O4, LiCu0.5Mn1.5O4 are cited. Among them, LiMn2O4 and LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 are preferable because it is possible to obtain a solid state battery having a high capacity. Also, although Li4Ti5O12 has a relatively low potential (oxidation-reduction potential to Li), it is possible to use Li4Ti5O12 as the cathode active material when it is combined with an anode active material which has lower potential. Further, as examples of the active material having a rock salt structure and used for a lithium solid state battery which can be used for a lithium solid state battery, LiCoO2, LiNiO2, LiMnO2, LiCo1/3Ni1/3Mn1/3O2, LiVO2, and LiCrO2 are cited. As examples of the active material having an olivine structure and used for a lithium solid state battery, LiFePO4, LiMnPO4 are cited. As amount of the cathode active material contained in the cathode active material layer is not particularly limited. For example, the amount is preferably within the range of 1% by weight to 90% by weight and more preferably within the range of 10% by weight to 80% by weight. The cathode active material layer may be a layer which is constituted solely by the cathode active material. Further, cathode active material layer of the present invention may further contain the solid electrolyte material which has the ion conductivity. By adding the solid electrolyte material, it is possible to improve the ion conductivity of the cathode active material layer. In particular, in the present invention, it is preferable that the cathode active material layer contains the above-mentioned ion conductor as the solid electrolyte material. For example, when a solid electrolyte layer contains the above-mentioned ion conductor, an ion conductive path is continuously formed between the cathode active material layer and the solid electrolyte layer so that it becomes possible to reduce the interface resistance between two layers. Further, when both of the cathode active material and the solid electrolyte material contained in the cathode active material layer have the spinel structure, there is an advantage that the ion conductivity within the cathode active material layer improves. An amount of the solid electrolyte material contained in the cathode active material layer is not particularly limited. For example, the amount is preferably within the range of 1% by weight to 40% by weight, and more preferably within the range of 5% by weight to 20% by weight. Further, the cathode active material layer of the present invention may further contain a conductive material which has electron conductivity. By adding the conductive material, it becomes possible to improve the electron conductivity of the cathode active material layer. As examples of the conductive material, materials such as acetylene black, Ketjen black, activated carbon, graphite, and carbon fiber are cited. A thickness of the cathode active material layer is not particularly limited. For example, the thickness is preferably within the range of 0.1 μm to 1000 μm. 3. Anode Active Material Layer Next, an anode active material layer of the present invention will be explained. The anode active material layer of the present invention contains at least an anode active material. Further, the anode active material layer may further contain at least one of the solid electrolyte material and the conductive material. As examples of the anode active material, an active material having a spinel structure, a metal active material, and a carbon active material can be cited. Among them, the active material having a spinel structure is preferable. For example, when a solid electrolyte layer contains the above-mentioned ion conductor (the ion conductor having a spinel structure), an ion conductive path is continuously formed between the anode active material layer and the solid electrolyte layer so that it becomes possible to reduce the interface resistance between two layers. As examples of the active material which has a spinel structure and is used for a lithium solid state battery, Li4Ti5O12, LiMn2O4, and Li4Mn5O12 are cited. Among them, Li4Ti5O12 is preferable because it has little change in volume caused by insertion of Li ions and thereby, it is possible to obtain a solid state battery having excellent durability. When there is a difference in potential between the cathode active material and the anode active material, they function as a battery. Accordingly, by selecting the cathode active material having higher electric potential, it is possible to use the above-mentioned cathode active material as the anode active material. Further, as examples of the metal active material, In, Al, Si, and Sn can be cited. As examples of carbon active material, mesocarbon microbead (MCMB), high orientation graphite (HOPG), hard carbon, and soft carbon can be cited. In particular, as shown in FIG. 3, it is preferable that a solid electrolyte layer 3 contains a Li ion conductor ((LixM1−x−yM′y)Al2O4), a cathode active material contained in a cathode active material layer 1 is LiMn2O4, and an anode active material contained in an anode active material layer 2 is Li4Ti5O12. As these materials have the spinel structure, it becomes possible to continuously form a Li ion conductive path through the whole battery. Thereby, it is possible to obtain a high output solid battery. Further, when “M” is at least one of Mg and Zn and “M′” is Al, the size of each unit cells becomes about 8 Å which is about the same as those of LiMn2O4 and Li4Ti5O12. Thus, it is thought possible to significantly reduce the interface resistance without causing stress to each interface between layers. Moreover, Li4Ti5O12 has an advantage that it has less volume change caused by the insertion Li ions. In addition, the Li ion conductor ((LixM1−x−yM′y)Al2O4) has no change in its composition at the time of Li ion conduction. In view of the above, a solid battery excellent in durability is obtained when the above-mentioned materials are combined. An amount of the anode active material contained in the anode active material layer is not particularly limited. For example, the amount is preferably within the range of 1% by weight to 90% by weight, and further preferably within the range of 10% by weight to 80% by weight. The anode active material layer may be a layer constituted only by the anode active material. Further, the anode active material layer of the present invention may further contain a solid electrolyte material having ion conductivity. By adding the solid electrolyte material, it becomes possible to improve the ion conductivity of the anode active material layer. In particular, in the present invention, it is preferable that the anode active material layer contains the above-mentioned ion conductor as the solid electrolyte material. For example, when the solid electrolyte layer contains the above-mentioned ion conductor, an ion conductive path is continuously formed between the anode active material layer and the solid electrolyte layer so that it becomes possible to reduce the interface resistance between two layers. Further, when both of the anode active material and the solid electrolyte material contained in the anode active material layer have the spinel structure, there is an advantage that the ion conductivity within the anode active material layer improves. An amount of the solid electrolyte material contained in the anode active material layer is not particularly limited. For example, the amount is preferably within the range of 1% by weight to 40% by weight, and further preferably within the range of 5% by weight to 20% by weight. Further, the anode active material layer of present invention may further contain a conductive material which has electron conductivity. As the conductive material is the same as those explained in the above-section of “2. Cathode active material layer”, explanation here is omitted. A thickness of the anode active material layer is not particularly limited. For example, the thickness is preferably within the range of 0.1 μm to 1000 μm. 4.

As examples of a material for the anode current collector, SUS, copper, nickel, gold, and carbon are cited, and among them, SUS is preferable. Further, it is preferable to appropriately select factors such as the respective thickness and shape of the cathode current collector and anode current collector according to application of the solid state battery and the like.

It is preferably a lithium solid state battery, a sodium solid state battery, or, a potassium solid state battery, and more preferably a lithium solid state battery. Further, in the present invention, a power generating element constituted of the cathode active material layer/solid electrolyte layer/anode active material layer may be a sintered body. Thereby, it is possible to improve the adhering states of each layer and to further reduce an interface resistance. Further, the solid state battery of the present invention may be a primary battery or a secondary battery. Among them, it is preferably to be a secondary battery because it can be charged and discharged repeatedly and is useful for applications such as an in-car battery. As examples of a shape of the solid state battery of the present invention, a coin type, a laminated type, a cylindrical type, and a square type are cited. A method of producing a solid state battery of the present invention is not particularly limited as long as the method can produce the above-mentioned solid state battery and a method similar to the general producing method of a solid state battery can be used. For example, a method comprising the steps of: sequentially pressing a material constituting a cathode active material layer, a material constituting a solid electrolyte layer, and a material constituting an anode active material layer to thereby produce a power generating element; storing the power generating element in a battery case; and swaging the battery case, is cited.
