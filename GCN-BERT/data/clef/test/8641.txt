COMPOSITIONS, METHODS OF MAKING A COMPOSITION, AND METHODS OF USE CLAIM OF PRIORITY TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims priority to co-pending U.S. provisional application entitled "COMPOSITIONS, METHODS OF MAKING A COMPOSITION, AND METHODS OF USE" having Serial No.: 61/984,939, and filed on April 28, 2014, which is entirely incorporated herein by reference. This application is a continuation in-part application of U.S. Utility Application entitled "COMPOSITIONS, METHODS OF MAKING A COMPOSITION, AND METHODS OF USE" having serial number 14/049,732, and filed October 9, 2013, which is entirely incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND The globalization of business, travel and communication brings increased attention to worldwide exchanges between communities and countries, including the potential globalization of the bacterial and pathogenic ecosystem. Bactericides and fungicides have been developed to control diseases in man, animal and plants, and must evolve to remain effective as more and more antibiotic, pesticide and insecticide resistant bacteria and fungi appear around the globe. Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents has also emerged, throughout the world, as one of the major threats to both man and the agrarian lifestyle. Resistance to antibacterial and antifungal agents has emerged as an agricultural issue that requires attention and 20 improvements in the treatment materials in use today. For example, focusing on plants, there are over 300,000 diseases that afflict plants worldwide, resulting in billions of dollars of annual crop losses. The antibacterial/antifungal formulations in existence today could be improved and made more effective.

Discussion: In accordance with the purpose(s) of the present disclosure, as embodied and broadly described herein, embodiments of the present disclosure, in one aspect, relate to compositions including a copper/silica nanocomposite and a polymer, methods of making a composition, methods of using a composition, and the like. In an embodiment, the composition can be used as an antimicrobial agent to kill and/or inhibit the formation of microorganisms on a surface such as a tree, plant, and the like. An advantage of the present disclosure is that the composition is water soluble, non-phytotoxic, film- forming, and has antimicrobial properties. In particular, the combination of the copper/silica nanocomposite and a polymer in the composition provides for water soluble formulation that can form a film on a surface with enhanced adherence to other compositions not including the polymer, while not degrading the antimicrobial properties of the copper/silica nanocomposite. In addition, embodiments of the present disclosure provide for a composition that can be used for multiple purposes. Embodiments of the present disclosure are advantageous in that they can slowly release one or more agents that can be used to prevent, substantially prevent and/or treat or substantially treat a disease or condition in a plant, act as an antibacterial and/or antifungal. Another advantage of an embodiment of the present disclosure is that the agent(s) can be controllably released over a long period of time (e.g., from the day of application until a few weeks or months (e.g., about 6 or 8 months)). Another advantage of the present disclosure is that the composition is substantially (e.g., grater than about 95% and about 99%) or completely transparent to visible light or translucent to visible light. In an embodiment, the composition may have an antimicrobial characteristic (e.g., kills at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 99% of the microorganisms (e.g., bacteria) on the surface and/or reduces the amount of microorganisms that form or grow on the surface by at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%, or at least 99%, as compared to a similar surface without the composition disposed on the surface). Additional details are described in the Examples. In an embodiment, the composition can be disposed on a surface of a structure. In an embodiment, the structure can include plants such as trees, shrubs, grass, agricultural crops, and the like, includes leaves and fruit. In an embodiment, the composition provides uniform plant surface coverage, substantial uniform plant surface coverage, or substantially covers the plant. In an embodiment, the composition can be used to treat a plant having a disease or to prevent the plant from obtaining a disease. In an embodiment, the structure can include those that may be exposed to microorganisms and/or that microorganisms can grow on, such as, without limitation, fabrics, cooking counters, food processing facilities, kitchen utensils, food packaging, swimming pools, metals, drug vials, medical instruments, medical implants, yarns, fibers, gloves, furniture, plastic devices, toys, diapers, leather, tiles, and flooring materials. In an embodiment, the structure can include textile articles, fibers, filters or filtration units (e.g., HEPA for air and water), packaging materials (e.g., food, meat, poultry, and the like food packaging materials), plastic structures (e.g., made of a polymer or a polymer blend), glass or glass like structures on the surface of the structure, metals, metal alloys, or metal oxides structure, a structure (e.g., tile, stone, ceramic, marble, granite, or the like), and a combination thereof. In an embodiment, the copper component can include a copper ion, metallic copper, copper oxide, copper oxychloride, copper sulfate, copper hydroxide, and a combination thereof. The copper component can include copper ions that are electrostatically bound to the silica nanoparticle core or amorphous silica matrix, copper covalently bound to the hydrated surface of the nanoparticle or amorphous silica matrix, and/or copper oxides and/or hydroxides bound to the surface of the nanoparticle or amorphous silica matrix. In an embodiment, the composition includes the copper component in two or in all three of these states. In an embodiment, the copper component can be in a soluble (amorphous) and an insoluble (crystalline) form. By controlling the soluble and insoluble ratio, the release rate of the copper component can be controlled as a function of time. As a result, the release rate of the copper component can be controlled so that antibacterial and/or antifungal characteristics can be effective for time frames of days to weeks or to months. In other words, the copper component can be released from the multifunctional silica based nanoparticle or gel starting from the day of application and continuing release to about a week, about a month, about two months, about three months, about four months, about five months, about six months, about seven month, or about eight months. The ratio of the soluble to insoluble copper component can be adjusted to control the release rate. In an embodiment, the ratio of the soluble copper to the insoluble copper (e.g., Chelated Cu)x (Crystalline Cu)i_x) can be out 0: 1 to 1 :0 (X can be about 0.1 to 0.99 or about 0.01 to 1), and can be modified in increments of about 0.01 to produce the ratio that releases the Cu for the desired period of time. Parameters that can be used to adjust the ratio include: solvent polarity and protic nature (i.e., hydrogen bonding capability), Cu nanoparticle precursor (e.g., Cu sulfate) concentration, temperature, concentration of silane precursor (such as tetraethylorthosilicate, TEOS), amount of polymer, type of polymer, and the like. In an embodiment, the copper nanoparticle precursor compound can be an insoluble Cu compounds (e.g., copper hydroxide, cupric chloride, cuprous chloride, cupric oxide, cuprous oxide), a soluble Cu compounds (e.g., copper sulfate, copper nitrate), or a combination thereof. In an embodiment, the silane nanoparticle precursor can be alkyl (C2 to C6) silane, tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), tetramethoxy silane (TMOS), sodium silicate, a silane precursor that can produce silicic acid or silicic acid like intermediates, or a combination thereof In an embodiment, the metallic copper can be about 1 microgram ^g)/mL to 20 milligram (mg)/mL weight percent, of the copper/silica-polymer nanocomposite. "Silica gel matrix" or "silica nanogel matix" refers to amorphous gel like substance that is formed by the interconnection of silica particles (e.g., nanoparticles (e.g., 2 to 500 nm or 5 to 50 nm)) to one another. In an embodiment, the amorphous silica gel has no ordered (e.g., defined) structure (opposite to crystalline structure) so an "amorphous gel" refers to gel material having amorphous structural composition. In an embodiment, the silica nanoparticles of the silica gel are interconnected covalently (e.g., through -Si-O-Si- bonds), physically associated via Van der Waal forces, and/or through ionic interactions (e.g., with copper ions). In an embodiment, the silica particles are interconnected and copper nanoparticles can be disposed within the silica gel matrix and/or attached to one or more silica particles. In an embodiment, the copper nanoparticles are substantially (e.g., greater than about 80%, about 90%, about 95%, or about 99%) monodisperse. In an embodiment, the silica gel is disposed around the entire copper nanoparticle, which, although not intending to be bound by theory, causes the copper/silica nanocomposite to be transparent to visible light. Embodiments of the present disclosure include the appropriate ratio of silica gel to copper nanoparticle so that the nanocomposite is transparent to visible light, while also maintaining antimicrobial characteristics. In an embodiment, the diameter of the particles (e.g., silica and/or copper) can be varied from a few nanometers to hundreds of nanometers by appropriately adjusting synthesis parameters, such as amounts of silane precursor, polarity of reaction medium, pH, time or reaction, and the like. For example, the diameter of the particles can be controlled by adjusting the time frame of the reaction. In an embodiment, the silica and copper nanoparticles can independently be about 2 to 25 nm or about 5 to 20 nm. In addition, the concentration of the copper ions can be appropriately adjusting synthesis parameters, such as amounts of silane precursor, polarity of reaction medium, pH, time or reaction, and the like. As mentioned above, the composition also includes a polymer. Although not intending to be bound by theory, the polymer or polymer copper/silica nanocomposite may increase the solubility of the composition, enhance the film- forming characteristic of the composition, and/or enhance the adherence characteristics of the composition, while not retarding the antimicrobial characteristics of the composition. In an embodiment, the polymer can include one or more of the following: polyacrylamide, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrolidone, polyethyleneirnine, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene gyeol, polyacrylic acid, dextran, chitosan (e.g., water soluble), alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyacrylamide, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, starch, and a combination thereof (e.g., poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)). In an embodiment, the ratio of copper/silica nanocomposite to polymer is about 0.1 : l to 3: 1 or about 0.5: 1 to 2: 1. The polymer was added to Cu/Silica nanogel after acid mediated TEOS hydrolysis in acidic conditions. The pH was then raised to about 8 to 9. Based on HRTEM results, the Cu/Silica nanogel integrity remained intact after polymer addition. Therefore, the polymer stabilized Cu/silica nanogel material at higher pHs (e.g., about 6 to 9) by surface interacting with Cu//silica nanogel via intermolecular forces.

In an embodiment, the pH can be adjusted to about 1.0 to 3.5 using a mineral acid such as nitric acid or hydrochloric acid. In an embodiment, the weight ratio of the silica precursor material to the copper precursor compound can be about 0.1 : 1 to 3 : 1. After mixing for a period of time (e.g., about 30 minutes to a few hours or about 12 to 36 hours), a mixture including silica nanoparticles with the copper nanoparticles can be formed. Subsequently, the medium can be brought to a pH of about 7 and held for a time period (e.g., a few hours to a day) to form a silica nanoparticle gel, where the silica nanoparticles are interconnected. In an embodiment, the copper nanoparticles can be part of the interconnection of the silica nanoparticles and/or dispersed within the matrix, while copper ions can be dispersed within the matrix as well. Next a polymer can be added to the mixture having an acidic pH. The mixture is stirred for about 12 to 36 hours. Subsequently, the pH is raised to about 4 using a base to form the composition. This process can be performed using a single reaction vessel or can use multiple reaction vessels. In an embodiment, after the composition is disposed on the surface, the structure may have an antimicrobial characteristic that is capable of killing a substantial portion of the microorganisms (e.g., bacteria such as E.coli, B.subtilis and S. aureus) on the surface of the structure and/or inhibits or substantially inhibits the growth of the microorganisms on the surface of the structure. The phrase "killing a substantial portion" includes killing at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 99% of the microorganism (e.g., bacteria) on the surface that the composition is disposed on, relative to structure that does not have the composition disposed thereon. The phrase "substantially inhibits the growth" includes reducing the growth of the microorganism (e.g., bacteria) by at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at least about 95%, or at least about 99% of the microorganisms on the surface that the composition is disposed on, relative to a structure that does not have the composition disposed thereon. As mentioned above, embodiments of the present disclosure are effective for the treatment of diseases affecting plants such as citrus plants and trees. In an embodiment, the composition can function as an antibacterial and/or antifungal, specifically, treating, substantially treating, preventing or substantially preventing, plant diseases such as citrus greening (HLB) and citrus canker diseases. The copper can be released from the composition so that it can act as an antibacterial and/or antifungal for a period of time (e.g., from application to days to months). The design of the composition facilitates uniform plant surface coverage or substantially uniform plant surface coverage. In an embodiment, the composition that is applied to plants can have a superior adherence property in various types of exposure to atmospheric conditions such as rain, wind, snow, and sunlight, such that it is not substantially removed over the time frame of the release of the copper. In an embodiment, the composition has a reduced phytotoxic effect or is non-phytotoxic to plants and reduced environmental stress due to minimal Cu content. Embodiments of the present disclosure can applied on the time frames consistent with the release of the copper, and these time frames can include from the first day of application to about a week, about a month, about two months, about three months, about four months, about five months, about six months, about seven month, or about eight months.

Copper Silica Polymer Nanocomposite: Characterization : Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) was conducted to observe the morphology, crystallinity and confirm the elemental composition of the 2 nanoformulations (SG0023 and SG0024). SEM was conducted on a Zeiss Ultra-55 FEG SEM using mica wafers. The TEM was conducted on a FEI Tecnai F30 using carbon filmed gold grids. In the SG0023 formulation, the elemental composition was confirmed using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) while doing SEM AND HRTEM. The EDS confirmed the presence of our sample by identifying the Cu and Si in the material (Figures 2, 4, and 6). SEM images showed spherical clusters within the larger silica matrix, with aggregates ranging from 50- 600 nm (Figures 1, 3, and 5). HRTEM exhibited a well dispersed material with areas of light and dark contrast of electron rich material (Figures 7 and 9). The crystallinity of the Cu materials were confirmed using Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) (Figures 8). Crystallites of Cu were clearly visible at high magnification. Determination of the lattice revealed spacing of 2.76A, 2.27 A, 3.03 A, 1.78 A and 2.54 A. These values correspond with CuO, CuO, CU2O, Cu and CuO respectively (Figures 10 and 11). In the SG0024 formulation, the elemental composition was confirmed using Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) while doing SEM AND HRTEM. The EDS confirmed the presence of our sample by identifying the Cu and Si in the material (Figures 12, 19, and 21). SEM images showed spherical clusters within the larger silica matrix, with aggregates ranging from 50- 300 nm (Figures 18 and 20). HRTEM exhibited a well dispersed material with areas of light and dark contrast of electron rich material (Figures 13 and 14). The crystallinity of the Cu materials were confirmed using Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) (Figure 15). Crystallites of Cu were clearly visible at high magnification. Determination of the lattice revealed spacing of 2.15k, 2.45 A and 2.26 A. These values correspond with CuO, Ο¾0 and CuO respectively (Figures 16 and 17). Phytotoxicity Studies: Phytotoxicity studies were conducted to observe plant injury on exposure to our nanoformulations. Studies were conducted on Vinca sp obtained from the local Home Depot and kept in a mini-greenhouse under conditions >80F temperature and >40% humidity. Plants were obtained and allowed to acclimatize for 24hrs before formula application. Nanoformulations were applied at specific Cu concentrations between 6 and 8 am before temperatures rose too high. Plants were observed for tissue damage at 24, 48 and 72hr time points. It was seen that SG0001, SG0005, SG0015, SG0017, SG0018, SG0020, SG0021 and SG0022 (Figures 22 and 23) caused moderate to high levels of plant tissue damage. SG0022M, SG0023, SG0024 and Kocide 3000 (Figures 22 and 24) exhibited no plant tissue damage at any Cu concentrations after 72 hrs. The reason for no toxicity was due to higher pHs in SG0022M, SG0023, SG0024 and Kocide 3000. Higher pHs lead to oxidation of Cu ions into less soluble Cu oxide and hydroxide. Antimicrobial Studies: Antimicrobial studies were conducted to ascertain the effectiveness of synthesized nanoformulations in comparison to the Kocide 3000 control. Studies conducted were growth inhibition assays using Muller Hinton 2 (MH2) broth and determination of the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) following the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Studies were conducted against gram negative E.coli sp. Growth inhibition studies showed reduced bacterial growth as Cu concentration increased. Results indicated improved antimicrobial efficacy in Cu nanoformulations in relation to the Kocide 3000 control (Figures 26, 27, and 28). The MIC of Cu nanoformulations was found to be 437.5 μg/mL for SG0001, SG0005, SG0015, SG0017 and SG0018. The MIC for SG0020, SG0021, SG0022, SG0022M, SG0023 and SG0024 was 500 μg/mL while Kocide 3000 had a value of 1000 μg/mL (Figure 25). This reinforces the higher antimicrobial efficacy of our Cu nanoformulations.
