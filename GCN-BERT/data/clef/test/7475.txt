STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable THE NAMES OF PARTIES TO A JOINT RESEARCH AGREEMENT Not Applicable INCORPORATION-BY-REFERENCE OF MATERIAL SUBMITTED ON A COMPACT DISC Not Applicable BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The invention relates to a device for physical fitness and methods of training, and in particular, to a light weight rope device. 2. Description of the Related Art Numerous techniques have been developed over the years to improve a person's cardiovascular and physical fitness. From high intensity exercise videos, cross fit, and traditional brick and mortar gyms, fitness trainers are continually developing the next best fitness program for their clients. Once such program, cross fit, uses non-traditional objects to provide clients with intense physical workouts. Cross fit uses objects such as industrial size tires, ropes, and fire hoses as exercises to improve fitness. These objects challenge clients by taking them out of the traditional brick and mortar exercise facility with weight machines and cardiovascular machines and introducing them to new, unique training techniques. A battle rope is a type of exercise equipment. Battle ropes are typically repurposed ropes taken from other industries, such as maritime ropes for anchoring, and repurposed for exercising. A typical battle rope is thirteen to fifteen and a half meters (13-15.5 m) long, is 3.8 cm in diameter, and weighs nine to eleven-and-a-half kilograms (9-11.5 kg). The rope is made from braided Manila hemp or polyethylene strands. A person exercising with a battle rope fastens one end of the rope to an anchor. An anchor can be a mount on a wall, door, or post, or can be another person holding one end of the rope. The exerciser holds the rope at the end of the rope that opposes the end that is anchored. Next, the person exercising raises and lowers the held end to create a wave in the rope. The person repeats the raising and lowering to exercise the muscles and arms. The person exercising can use various stances while moving the rope to exercise the muscles of the lower body. One person can use two battle ropes at the same time. The person holds one rope in each hand. The ropes are then lifted and lowered by each hand to exercise both arms. Two people can exercise using one or two ropes. Each person holds one end of each rope. The ropes have the same length. The two people exercising can work together to create waves in the rope. Current battle ropes limit a person's ability to exercise continuously for long durations with the battle ropes because exercisers fatigue too quickly. As a result, battle ropes are not used as a focus for an exercise class. The weight of the battle ropes place tremendous strain on muscles and joints in the human body when used for exercising. In addition, the diameter of the ropes is not ideal for grasping with a human hand, particularly for women. Due to this mismatch, the ropes are difficult to use and cause injuries to the hands in the form of calluses, blisters, and muscle strains. Current battle ropes are too heavy to be used for extended period of time. Generally, a pair of people oscillates the battle ropes until the people become too fatigued to continue. For most people, the time limit is five minutes. Typically, the ropes are worked for alternating thirty second (30 s) work/rest cycles in the five minutes. Accordingly, battle ropes are used as part of circuit training or a boot camp but are not used as the focus of an entire fitness class or workout. The length of battle ropes limits their usefulness in a group setting. The ropes are 13-15 m long. Accordingly, they only can be used in large rooms. In smaller rooms and studios, the length of the battle ropes limits their use to a few pairs of users at a time. Typically, one pair of battle ropes is used as a station in a circuit training setting. While the pair of ropes consumes a large area of floor space enough room remains in most studios for other exercisers to have space to exercise at other stations in the circuit. In addition to the weight, the diameter of battle ropes make exercising difficult for people with smaller hands to hold the ropes for extended times. Examples of people with smaller hands include many women and children. Accordingly, the diameter of existing battle ropes limits their usefulness in workout routines that take longer than five minutes. Presently, two people use battle ropes by holding opposing ends of the battle ropes and moving the battle ropes in varying directions. The maximum number of users on a battle rope is two. The users are stationary while using the ropes. Because the ropes are heavy, they generally need to be long, e.g. 12-15 m, in order to allow the user to oscillate the ropes properly. Typical battle ropes are 3.8 to 5.0 cm thick. Accordingly, there is a need to develop a new type of battle rope that is light weight, responsive, and easier to grasp for physical conditioning. In particular, a need exists for a battle rope that can be used in a class environment for at least thirty minutes by a typical person. A further need exists for a device that provides the fitness advantages of battle ropes but that can be used in a fitness class with more than two people. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the invention is to provide an aerorope device for exercising. The aerorope device includes a hub. The hub is configured to secure to an anchor during use. The hub has a connector. A rope is secured to the anchor by the connector. The rope is configured to be held when exercising. Another object of the invention is to provide an aerorope device including a hub, at least one flexible rope having a first end and a second end, where the flexible rope slidably engages with the hub and the first and second ends extend outward from the hub. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a method for exercising with an aerorope device. The first step involves engaging the first end of at least one flexible rope to a stationary hub. Next, the second end of the flexible rope is extended outward from the stationary hub. Next, the user grasps the second end of the flexible rope in preparation for physical conditioning. The user positions the second end of the flexible rope to allow slack in the flexible rope between first and second ends. The user then moves the flexible rope in varying directions for physical conditioning. A further object of the invention is to provide an aerorope device that is sized and weighted so that it can be used by most participants throughout an hour workout. A rope that weighs 0.45 kg has been found satisfactory. To create a 0.45 kg rope that is sized for women and men to hold, a 7.6 m long rope that is 2.22 cm wide can be used. The present invention has the advantage of allowing clients to train with battle ropes, or aeroropes, more effectively as a fitness tool. Present ropes are large and fatigue the client quickly. The instant invention provides clients with a cardio vascular training program with minimal strain on the body. The instant invention is portable, light weight, and provides total body conditioning. Other features of the invention are set forth in the appended claims. A further object of the invention is to provide an aerorope device that is portable and that can use commonly available weights to form an anchor. The anchor should be able to connect or fasten to, releaseably, objects that are common in a gym. Examples of items are forty-five pound plates used for weightlifting or sandbags. Such heavy items provide a significant anchor to prevent the device from moving unintentionally during use. In addition, by being releaseable the weight can remain in the gym and the device can be easily transported to a different location (e.g. a second gym) and reloaded there. A further object of the invention is to provide a fitness device that can be used continuously by attendees of a fitness class held in a studio for a time longer than five minutes. The class preferably would have at least three attendees. While classes longer than five minutes are acceptable, classes longer than thirty minutes are preferred. To provide ropes that can be used by a majority of people continuously for longer than five minutes and preferably longer than thirty minutes, the weight, diameter, and length of the rope must be reduced compared to traditional battle ropes. A further object of the invention is to provide a device that utilizes ropes that have a length, diameter, and weight that allows them to be operated (i.e. oscillated to create waves) in time with contemporary music. If the ropes are not sized properly, the ropes will not be able to be operated synchronically with the music. Although the invention is illustrated and described herein as embodied in an aerorope exercise device, the invention is not limited to the details shown because various modifications and structural changes may be made without departing from the invention and the equivalents of the claims. However, the construction and method of operation of the invention together with additional objects and advantages thereof will be best understood from the following description of specific embodiments when read in connection with the accompanying drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Embodiments of the invention are described below and are shown in the figures of the drawing. Unless otherwise mentioned the reference numbers are used consistently throughout the figures. FIGS. 1 and 2 show an aerorope exercise device. The aerorope exercise device includes hub 100. In this embodiment, the hub 100 is made netting 102 made from polyester strands. When exercise is to be performed, the netting is closed to hold an anchoring weight 104. Netting 102 is a thin rope that forms a rectangular lattice. The spaces between the strands of the netting 102 define openings 105 to attach fitness equipment, for example, battle ropes 108. Although shown in a rectangular mesh pattern in FIG. 1, netting 102 can take various shapes and sizes as long as openings 105 remain to attach fitness equipment or connectors which in turn attach to fitness equipment. Examples of connectors, which are not shown include metal rings and carabiners. Anchoring weight 104 is placed on top of netting 102 on the ground. FIG. 2 depicts anchoring weight 104 as a weight plate commonly found in exercise facilities. Plate weights range is various shapes and sizes, such as, but not limited to, 10, 25, 35, and 45 pound (lb) weight increments. The weight plate provides the weight to anchor netting 102 in position, typically on the floor, during the aerorope exercise program. The overall span of netting 102 exceeds the size of anchoring weight 104. After anchoring weight 104 is placed on top of netting 104, the ends of netting 102 are lifted from the ground and secured together with carabiner 106. As shown in FIG. 3, the four corners of netting 102 that extend outward from anchoring weight 104 are secured using carabiner 106, thereby encapsulating anchoring weight 104. Hub 100 includes the combination of netting 102, anchoring weight 104, and carabiner 106. Hub 100 is an anchor point for an aerorope exercise. Netting 102 and carabiner 106 move relative to anchoring weight 104 but anchoring weight 104 keeps hub 100 anchored to the ground, thereby preventing hub 100 moving laterally on the ground. Netting 102 and carabiner 106 move during the aerorope exercise. Hub 100, depicted as an assembly of netting 10, anchoring weight 104, and carabiner 106, can take many forms. A hub includes anything that can attach to a rope. For instance, any type of weight, a permanent connection point, a pole, or a clip on the floor, to name a few, can be used as a hub for the aerorope device. The hub can be permanently affixed to the floor or other anchoring point. Alternatively, the hub is releasable for repositioning within an exercise room or for mobility during travel. Once hub 100 is assembled and positioned, flexible rope 108 with rope ends 110 engage with hub 100. Rope end 110 of flexible rope 108 inserts through opening 105 in netting 102. Rope end 110 of flexible rope 108 is routed through opening 105 of netting 102 and away from hub 100 until rope end 110 is substantially even with the opposing rope end 110 of flexible rope 108. When in position through netting 102, flexible rope 108 forms a U shape. In an example embodiment, one rope end 110 of flexible rope 108 is tied in a knot to netting 102 while the opposing rope end 100 is held by a client. The preferred embodiment of flexible rope 108 is 7.6 m long, 2.2 cm thick (or in diameter). The rope 108 weighs 0.45 kg. Rope ends of flexible rope 108 are dipped in a polymer material to protect a user's hands and provide added grip during an aerorope exercise. A preferred embodiment of an aerorope device includes netting 102 and ten (10) ropes 108. The combined weight is 23 kg. After flexible rope 108 is positioned through netting 102, a client begins exercising. The client holds both rope ends 110 of flexible rope 108 in their respective hands. The client then moves their arms, while holding rope ends 110 of flexible rope 108, for exercise. In an example embodiment, the client moves their left arm upwards while moving their right arm downward. In another example embodiment, the client moves their arms in the same direction substantially simultaneously. In yet another example embodiment, the client moves their arms in random motions. As shown in FIG. 1, the client moves their arms in varying directions to provide physical and aerobic conditioning. In an example embodiment, shown in FIG. 4, three people who are exercising use respective flexible ropes 108 connected to hub 100 in a group aerorope exercise program. In a group setting, an instructor provides direction to the clients using the instant invention. The ability to attach multiple flexible ropes 108 to openings 105 of netting 102 of hub 100 allows a group of clients to use the instant invention together in a training session. One advantage of using the instant invention in a group setting is the ability to choreograph a musical exercise program using aeroropes. For instance, an instructor can prepare a musical program with different beats and rhythm speed. Users move flexible ropes 108 based on the changing of beats or rhythm speed. In addition, users can dance or move relative to hub 100 based on the instructor's program. Users are not limited to standing in place and merely moving their arms to oscillate flexible ropes 108. Users can dance and circle around hub 100, together or individually, as part of an aeroropes exercise program. In a preferred embodiment of a method of using the aeroropes device continuously for longer than five minutes, a device is utilized with a rope 108 that is not longer than 8 m long, not wider than 2.5 cm, and not weighing more than 0.5 kg. In a more preferred embodiment, the previously described rope can be utilized in a class that calls for the rope to be continuously used for more than thirty minutes. In a further preferred embodiment, the device includes at least three ropes being operated by three different users. The three users synchronize their use of the ropes according to the choreography during the workout. The choreography calls for the users to not only synchronize with each other but to music as well. In FIGS. 5A and 5B, example embodiments of the instant invention are depicted using a duffle bag and a door, respectively, to provide an anchoring point for flexible rope 108 during exercise. In FIG. 5A, duffle bag 112 with duffle loop 114 is placed on the ground. Duffle bag 112 provides the anchor point for the aerorope exercise. Flexible rope 108 is routed through, or tied to, duffle loop 114 of duffle bag 112. Duffle bag 112 provides an alternative way to anchor flexible rope 108 for client exercise. In FIG. 5B, door strap 116 with door loop 118 is affixed to an edge of a door. Flexible rope 108 is routed through, or tied to, door loop 118 as another way to anchor flexible rope 108. This example embodiment allows a client to use the instant invention in numerous locations. In an example embodiment, a client uses weighted gloves to grip rope ends 110. Weighted gloves add weight to a client's arms while moving flexible rope 108 in varying directions, providing additional difficulty while using the instant invention. A method for using the instant invention, an aerorope device, includes engaging one rope end 110 of flexible rope 108 through opening 105 of netting 102 of hub 100. Once engaged, rope end 110 extends outward from hub 100 until both rope ends 110 are substantially equidistant to hub 100. A client grasps rope ends 110 of flexible rope 108 with their hands to prepare for physical and aerobic conditioning. The client positions themselves to provide slack in flexible rope 108 between hub 100 and rope ends 110, i.e., flexible rope 108 is loose. To begin exercising, the client moves flexible rope 108 in varying directions for physical and aerobic conditioning. In an example embodiment, clients move flexible ropes 108 in unison during the conditioning program. Moving flexible ropes 108 in unison creates a higher level of difficulty for the conditioning program. Instead of each client moving flexible ropes 108 in individualized movements, all clients move flexible ropes 108 together in rhythmic motions. Instructors can be certified and licensed to teach and use the aerorope device. 1.
