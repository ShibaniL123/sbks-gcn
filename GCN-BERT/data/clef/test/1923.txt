TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a fluorescent probe having a novel fluorophore. BACKGROUND ART Fluorescein is a molecule reported in 1871, and has been widely used as a pH indicator or a labeling dye, because of the high water solubility and high fluorescence quantum yield thereof. Since a calcium probe containing fluorescein as a platform was developed, there have been provided a large number of highly sensitive fluorescent off/on type probes utilizing intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PeT), decyclization or cyclization of Spiro ring, and the like. In particular, as for probes utilizing the intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer, by designing such probes with taking the oxidation potential of the benzene ring of fluorescein into consideration, off/on of fluorescence can be attained before and after trapping of an object substance for measurement, and an object substance for measurement can be measured with high sensitivity. There are conventionally known fluorescent probes comprising rhodamine as a platform as fluorescent dye enabling red color bioimaging, and calcium probes such as Rhod-2, and the like have been put into put into practical use as probes utilizing the intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer. However, since rhodamine has amino group in the molecule, it has a problem that it becomes cationic in living bodies, and comes to easily accumulate in specific organelles, especially mitochondria. Further, almost no reports were made as for structural modification of fluorescein at the oxygen atom of the 10-position of the xanthene ring, and optical characteristics of such compounds wherein the oxygen atom at the 10-position of the xanthene ring is replaced with another type of atom are not known so far. Although a compound corresponding to the basic structure of rhodamine, pyronin Y (PY), of which oxygen atom is replaced with silicon atom (TMDHS) and application of this compound as a fluorescent probe have already been reported (Best, Q et al., Pacifichem 2010, subject number 2335, Dec. 19, 2010; Yuichiro KOIDE et al., Fourth Convention of The Japanese Society for Molecular Imaging, subject number P8-9, May 14, 2009), any compound corresponding to fluorescein of which oxygen atom at the 10-position of the xanthene ring is replaced with silicon atom has not been reported so far, and fluorescent characteristics of such a compound are also not known.

This explanation is for assisting easy understanding of the descriptions of the specification, and it is not intended to exclude exceptions. Further, they do not precede the specific definitions in this specification. (a) “TokyoMagenta” means a compound represented by the general formula (I) wherein R1 is hydrogen atom, R2 and R3 are hydrogen atoms, R4 and R5 are methyl groups, R6 and R7 are hydrogen atoms, R8 is hydrogen atom, and X is silicon atom, and this compound is also abbreviated as “TM”. (b) A compound represented by the general formula (I) wherein R1 is hydrogen atom, R2 and R3 are hydrogen atoms, R4 and R5 are methyl groups, R6 and R7 are hydrogen atoms, R8 is hydrogen atom, and X is germanium atom may be abbreviated as “Ge-TM”. For example, when an abbreviation “2-Me TokyoMagenta” is used, “2-Me” means that methyl group as R1 substitutes at the 2-position of the benzene ring substituting at the 9-position of the xanthene ring of “TM”. Further, when an abbreviation “2-OMe-5-Me TokyoMagenta” is used, “2-OMe-5-Me” means that methoxy group and methyl group as R1 substitute at the 2-position and 5-position of the benzene ring substituting at the 9-position of the xanthene ring of “TM”, respectively. Examples of abbreviation for the case that “TM” is the platform are explained above. When “Ge-TM” is the platform, only “TM” is replaced by “Ge-TM”, and other indications are used in the same manner. In the specification, “an alkyl group” or an alkyl moiety of a substituent containing an alkyl moiety (for example, an alkoxy group, and the like) means a linear, branched, or cyclic alkyl group, or an alkyl group consisting of a combination thereof, having, for example, 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 4 carbon atoms, more preferably 1 to 3 carbon atoms, unless specifically indicated. More specifically, examples of the alkyl group include, for example, methyl group, ethyl group, n-propyl group, isopropyl group, cyclopropyl group, n-butyl group, sec-butyl group, isobutyl group, tert-butyl group, cyclopropylmethyl group, n-pentyl group, n-hexyl group, and the like. The “halogen atom” referred to in the specification may be any one of fluorine atom, chlorine atom, bromine atom, and iodine atom, preferably, fluorine atom, chlorine atom, or bromine atom. In the compounds represented by the general formula (I), R1 represents the same or different 1 to 5 monovalent substituents existing on the benzene ring, and at least one of the substituents is a substituent that acts as a trapping group for an object substance for measurement. The substituent that acts as a trapping group may consist of a single substituent that acts as a trapping group, or may consist of a combination of two or more substituents on the benzene ring, preferably two adjacent substituents on the benzene ring, and act as the trapping group as such a combination. Such two substituents may bind together to form a ring structure, and such a ring structure may change into an open ring structure after a reaction with an object substance for measurement. Alternatively, two adjacent substituents may form a ring structure together with an object substance for measurement after a reaction of these two substituents with the object substance for measurement. The benzene ring may constitute a part of the trapping group for realizing the action of the trapping group. Furthermore, two or more substituents that can independently act as the trapping group may bind to the benzene ring, and two or more kinds of different substituents that act as trapping groups for different measurement object substances may exist on the benzene ring. Substitution positions of one or two or more substituents that act as the trapping group on the benzene ring are not particularly limited, and they can substitute at arbitrary positions. There may be a case where R1 represents only the trapping group for an object substance for measurement, and any other substituents other than the trapping group do not exist on the benzene ring. When R8 is a trapping group for an object substance for measurement, it is not necessary that at least one of the substituents represented by R1 is a trapping group for an object substance for measurement. Therefore, when R8 is a trapping group for an object substance for measurement, the substituents substituting on the benzene ring represented by R1 may not be a trapping group for an object substance for measurement. Further, a structure consisting of a combination of the benzene ring to which R1 binds and R1 may function as the trapping group, and such a configuration is also encompassed by the scope of the present invention. Type of the object substance for measurement is not particularly limited, and it may be any of, for example, metal ions (for example, alkali metal ions such as sodium ion and lithium ion, alkaline earth metal ions such as calcium ion, magnesium ion, zinc ion, and the like), nonmetallic ions (carbonate ion, hydroxide ion, and the like), reactive oxygen species (for example, hydroxyl radical, peroxynitrite, hypochlorous acid, hydrogen peroxide, and the like), enzymes, and the like. Various kinds of trapping groups for specifically trapping an object substance for measurement have been proposed, and a suitable trapping group can be appropriately selected depending on the type of the object substance for measurement. For example, there can be used the trapping groups described in Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (Kokai) No. 10-226688, WO99/51586, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (Kokai) No. 2000-239272, WO01/62755, and the like, as well as the catalog of Molecular Probes Inc.

However, the trapping group is not limited to those described in the aforementioned publications. In the specification, the term “trapping” should be construed in its broadest sense which includes trapping of a metal ion or the like by chelating or the like without substantially causing chemical transformation of the trapping group, as well as trapping causing change of the chemical structure of the trapping group by chemical reaction with an object substance for measurement, and trapping accompanied by cleavage and release of the trapping group caused by contact with an object substance for measurement, and should not be construed in any limitative sense.

Preferred examples of the compound of the present invention introduced with a calcium trapping group include compounds represented by the following general formula (IJ), wherein: (1) R1a is a C1-6 alkyl group such as methyl group and ethyl group, or carboxy group, R2, R3, R6, and R7 are independently hydrogen atom, fluorine atom, or chlorine atom, R4 and R5 are independently a C1-6 alkyl group such as methyl group and ethyl group, R8 is hydrogen atom, R201, R202, R203, and R204 are carboxy groups, and R205 and R206 are independently hydrogen atom, a C1-6 alkyl group such as methyl group, nitro group, or fluorine atom; or (2) R1a is a C1-6 alkyl group such as methyl group or ethyl group, or carboxy group, R2, R3, R6, and R7 are independently hydrogen atom, fluorine atom, or chlorine atom, R4 and R5 are independently a C1-6 alkyl group such as methyl group and ethyl group, R8 is hydrogen atom, an alkanoyl group such as acetyl group, or an alkanoyloxyalkyl group such as acetoxymethyl group, R201, R202, R203, and R204 are alkanoyloxyalkyloxycarbonyl groups such as acetoxymethyloxycarbonyl group, and R205 and R206 are independently hydrogen atom, a C1-6 alkyl group such as methyl group, nitro group, or fluorine atom; (3) the compounds of (2) mentioned above, wherein R1a is carboxy group, and binds to the 9-position of the X-xanthene ring to form a lactone, and the oxo group at the 3-position of the X-xanthene ring is converted into hydroxy group, an alkanoyloxy group such as acetoxy group, or an alkanoyloxyalkyloxy group such as acetoxymethyloxy group, (4) the compounds wherein the trapping group formed by a combination of the benzene ring to which R1 binds and R1 is a trapping group represented by the formula (j-1), and the like. However, the compound of the present invention is not limited to these compounds. It should be noted that the compounds represented by the formula (I) wherein the benzene ring constitutes a part of the trapping group, as in the case of the compounds of (4) mentioned above, are also encompassed by the scope of the present invention. The above calcium trapping groups are disclosed in the catalog of Molecular Probes, Inc. (Molecular Probes Handbook 11th Edition), Chapter 19 (Indicators for calcium ion, magnesium ion, zinc ion, and other metal ions), and J. Biol. Chem., 260, pp. 3440-3450, 1985. The trapping groups of (A) to (J) mentioned above are directly substitute on the benzene ring of the compounds represented by the aforementioned general formula (I) as R1, or they may also substitute on the benzene ring of the compounds represented by the aforementioned general formula (I) via an appropriate spacer. As the spacer, for example, —CO—NH— and the like can be used as shown in the aforementioned formula (R1b). Further, the trapping group having a benzene ring (including those having a polycyclic structure) as the end part thereof such as those of (A), B), (F), (G), (H), (I), and (J) may be those of which benzene ring as the end part comprises the benzene ring on which R1 substitutes of the compound represented by the general formula (I). The trapping groups of (A) to (J) mentioned above can be introduced into the compounds represented by the general formula (I) and salts thereof provided by the present invention by the methods disclosed in the aforementioned publications or other methods. All the disclosures of the aforementioned patent documents and references are incorporated into the disclosure of this specification by reference. Although it is not intended to be bound by any specific theory, the characteristic feature of the compounds of the present invention, i.e., on/off of fluorescence, is attained by the intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) (the details of PeT are disclosed in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 125, 8666.8671, 2003; J. Am. Chem. Soc., 127, 4888-4894, 2005; J. Am. Chem. Soc., 128, 10640-10641, 2006; J. Am. Chem. Soc., 126, 14079-14085, 2004; and YAKUGAKU ZASSHI, 126, 901-913, 2006). PeT is one of the ways of fluorescence quenching, and includes a phenomenon that electron transfer occurs from an electron donor moiety (PeT donor) neighboring a singlet excited fluorophore before the fluorophore that is excited by irradiation of excitation light and emits fluorescence returns to the ground state to cause quenching of fluorescence (a-PeT), and a phenomenon that electron transfer occurs to an electron acceptor moiety (PeT acceptor) neighboring a singlet excited fluorophore before the fluorophore that is excited by irradiation of excitation light and emits fluorescence returns to the ground state to cause quenching of fluorescence (d-PeT). Information concerning oxidation potential of the benzene ring to which R1 binds or the trapping group can be easily obtained by, for example, calculating the oxidation potential of the benzene ring or the trapping group in accordance with quantum chemistry procedures. Fall of the oxidation potential of the benzene ring or the trapping group means elevation of electron density of the benzene ring or the trapping group, and this corresponds to the elevation of the HOMO orbital energy. For example, HOMO energy of the benzene ring moiety or the trapping group moiety can be obtained by the density functional method (B3LYP/6-31G(d)). When R1 comprises the trapping group for an object substance for measurement, it is necessary to choose a benzene ring moiety to which R1 binds or trapping group moiety itself of which oxidation potential changes after trapping of an object substance for measurement, or a trapping group having a group that shows such an oxidation potential that the compound represented by the general formula (I) is substantially non-fluorescent before trapping of an object substance for measurement, and is cleaved and released at the time of the trapping of the object substance for measurement. As for the substituent represented by R1 that acts as the trapping group, or a combination of the substituent represented by R1 that acts as the trapping group and another substituent represented by R1 other than the trapping group in the case that such a substituent represented by R1 other than the trapping group exists in the compound of the present invention represented by the general formula (I), when the substituent represented by R1 that acts as the trapping group is a trapping group that changes the oxidation potential of the benzene ring to which R1 binds, the substituent represented by R1 that acts as the trapping group or the combination is chosen by the combination of (1) before trapping of an object substance for measurement, the oxidation potential of the benzene ring to which R1 binds is 1.57 V or lower, preferably 1.26 V or lower, and thus the compound represented by the general formula (I) is substantially non-fluorescent, and (2) after trapping of the object substance for measurement, the oxidation potential of the benzene ring to which R1 binds becomes 1.75 V or higher, preferably 1.98 V or higher, and thus a compound formed from the compound represented by the general formula (I) after the trapping becomes substantially highly fluorescent. Further, when the substituent represented by R1 that acts as the trapping group is a trapping group that does not substantially affect the oxidation potential of the benzene ring to which R1 binds in the compound of the present invention represented by the general formula (I) after trapping of an object substance for measurement, and trapping of the object substance for measurement is detected on the basis of change of oxidation potential of the trapping group itself, the substituent represented by R1 that acts as the trapping group or the combination is chosen so that, for example, the oxidation potential of the benzene ring to which R1 binds is 1.75 V or higher, preferably 1.98 V or higher, and thus the oxidation potential of the benzene ring to which R1 binds does not affect on/off of fluorescence, i.e., the compound became substantially highly fluorescent after trapping of the object substance for measurement. In the compounds represented by the general formula (I), when the substituent represented by R1 that acts as the trapping group itself is a group having a substantially low oxidation potential so that the compound represented by the general formula (I) is substantially non-fluorescent, the substituent represented by R1 that acts as the trapping group is chosen by the combination of, for example, (1) the oxidation potential of the group having a substantially low oxidation potential is 1.57 V or lower, preferably 1.26 V or lower, and (2) after trapping of the object substance for measurement, the oxidation potential of the group having a substantially low oxidation potential increases to 1.75 V or higher, preferably 1.98 V or higher, and thus a compound formed from the compound represented by the general formula (I) after the trapping becomes substantially highly fluorescent. The aforementioned theory is also applied to the compounds of the present invention represented by the general formula (I) wherein R8 acts as the trapping group. Further, various fluorescent probes for measuring the object substance for measurement utilizing the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (henceforth also referred to as “FRET”) have also been proposed. In this specification, FRET refers to a phenomenon that when certain two fluorescent compounds exist at small distance positions (generally 100 Å or smaller), and fluorescence spectrum of one of the two fluorescent compounds (donor) and excitation spectrum of the other (acceptor) overlap, fluorescence of the donor that should be naturally observed is decreased at irradiation of energy at the excitation wavelength of the donor, but fluorescence of the acceptor is observed instead. For example, as probes for measuring an enzymatic activity of a measurement object, of which linker connecting the donor and the acceptor is cleaved in an enzyme specific manner to cause on/off of FRET, there are proposed the fluorescent probe for measuring the caspase activity disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 3692488 (the donor is 2,7-dichlorofluorescein, and the acceptor is tetramethylrhodamine), the fluorescent probe for measuring the phosphodiesterase activity disclosed in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 124, pp. 1653-1657, 2002 (the donor is coumarin, and the acceptor is fluorescein), the fluorescent probe for measuring the β-lactamase activity disclosed in Science, 279, pp. 84-88, 1998 (the donor is coumarin, and the acceptor is fluorescein), and the like. Moreover, as a probes for measuring an enzymatic activity of a measurement object by changing wavelength of acceptor fluorescent dye to cause on/off of FRET, there is also proposed the fluorescent probe for measuring the tyrosine phosphatase activity disclosed in Chem. Eur. J., 9, pp. 1479-1485, 2003 (the donor is coumarin, and the acceptor is fluorescein). The compounds represented by the general formula (I) and salts thereof provided by the present invention can also be used as a fluorescence compound for the donor or acceptor of such a fluorescent probe utilizing FRET as mentioned above. For example, when a compound represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof provided by the present invention is used as the donor, a fluorescence compound showing absorption in a range of around 580 nm to 700 nm is suitable for the acceptor, on the basis of fluorescence wavelength of the compound represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof, and examples of such a fluorescence compound include SiR650 (Yuichiro KOIDE et al., Fourth Convention of The Japanese Society for Molecular Imaging, subject number P8-9, May 14, 2009), Cy5, Cy5.5, and the like. Further, when a compound represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof is used as the acceptor, a fluorescence compound showing emission of fluorescence in a range of around 500 nm to 600 nm is suitable for the donor, on the basis of absorption wavelength of the compound represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof, and fluorescein, BODIPY, rhodamine 123, rhodamine green, and the like are suitable for the donor. Further, Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-009577 discloses that the compounds represented by the general formula (I) and the salts thereof of the present invention can exist as a non-dissociated form (neutral form) and a dissociated form (anion form), of which maximal absorption wavelengths significantly deviate, and the difference of the wavelengths is about twice or more larger than that of the non-dissociated form (neutral form) and dissociated form (anion form) of a fluorescein derivative, and therefore if this property is utilized, they are useful as a platform compound for preparing a fluorescent probe enabling measurement of reactive oxygen species or various enzymes at high sensitivity. Accordingly, if the aforementioned property of the compounds represented by the general formula (I) and salts thereof of the present invention and R1 in the compounds represented by the general formula (I) and salts thereof of the present invention are utilized in combination, there can be provided a fluorescent probe of which fluorescent characteristic is significantly changes only when it traps multiple measurement object substances. For example, if a monovalent group cleavable with β-galactosidase is introduced as R8 of a compound represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof of the present invention, a group for trapping calcium ion is introduced as R1, and measurement is performed by using such a compound with an excitation light of around 580 nm, it can be used as a fluorescent probe that does not emit fluorescence when β-galactosidase or calcium ion independently exists, but emits fluorescence only when β-galactosidase and calcium ion simultaneously exist. In order to bind the aforementioned fluorescence compound and the compound represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof provided by the present invention, a group for the binding, for example, amino group, carboxy group or an active ester group thereof (succinimidyl ester and the like), formyl group, hydroxy group, mercapto group, maleimide group, isothiocyanato group, isocyanato group, and the like can be introduced into a substituent substituting on the compound represented by the general formula (I) or a salt thereof provided by the present invention. In the compounds represented by the general formula (I), a substituent other than the substituent that acts as the trapping group among the substituents represented by R1 existing on the benzene ring can also substitute at an arbitrary position on the benzene ring. It may also be preferred that any substituent other than the substituent that acts as the trapping group does not exist on the benzene ring. When a substituent other than the substituent that acts as a trapping group exists on the benzene ring, it is preferred that about 1 to 3 of such substituents exist. In the case where the substituent other than the substituent that acts as a trapping group exists on the benzene ring can substitute at an arbitrary position on the benzene ring, for example, it is preferred that the substituent exists at the ortho position with respect to the binding position of the condensed ring containing X when one of such substituents exists on the benzene ring. When two or more of such substituents exist on the benzene ring, it is preferred that one of the substituents exists at the ortho position with respect to the binding position of the condensed ring containing X. Although type of the substituent other than that act as the trapping group among the monovalent substituents represented by R1 is not particularly limited, it is preferably selected from, for example, the group consisting of an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkenyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkynyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, hydroxy group, carboxy group, sulfonyl group, an alkoxycarbonyl group, a halogen atom, and amino group. These monovalent substituents may further have one or two or more arbitrary substituents. For example, the alkyl group represented by R1 may have one or more of substituents selected from a halogen atom, carboxy group, sulfonyl group, hydroxy group, amino group, an alkoxy group, and the like, and the alkyl group represented by R1 may be, for example, a halogenated alkyl group, a hydroxyalkyl group, a carboxyalkyl group, an aminoalkyl group, or the like. The amino group represented by R1 may have one or two alkyl groups, and the amino group represented by R1 may be, for example, a monoalkylamino group or a dialkylamino group. Further, when the alkoxy group represented by R1 has a substituent, examples thereof include, for example, a carboxy-substituted alkoxy group, an alkoxycarbonyl-substituted alkoxy group, and the like, more specifically, 4-carboxybutoxy group, 4-acetoxymethyloxycarbonylbutoxy group, and the like. When two of the substituents other than that act as the trapping group among the monovalent substituents represented by R1 exist on the benzene ring, they are preferably selected from, for example, the group consisting of an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and carboxy group, and they are more preferably selected from the group consisting of an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and an alkoxy group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms. In this case, it is preferred that an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms exists at the ortho-position with respect to the binding position of the condensed ring containing X, and an alkoxy group (for example, an unsubstituted alkoxy group, a monocarboxy group-substituted alkoxy group, a monoalkoxycarbonyl-substituted alkoxy group, 4-acetoxymethyloxycarbonylbutoxy group and the like) exists at another position on the benzene ring. R2 and R3 independently represent hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or a halogen atom. When R2 or R3 represents an alkyl group, the alkyl group may have one or two or more substituents selected from a halogen atom, carboxy group, sulfonyl group, hydroxy group, amino group, an alkoxy group, and the like, and the alkyl group as R2 or R3 may be, for example, a halogenated alkyl group, a hydroxyalkyl group, a carboxyalkyl group, or the like. It is preferred that R2 and R3 are independently hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, and it is more preferred that R2 and R3 are both hydrogen atoms, or R2 and R3 are both chlorine atoms or fluorine atoms. R4 and R5 independently represent an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or an aryl group. It is preferred that R4 and R5 are independently an alkyl group having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, and it is more preferred that R4 and R5 are both methyl groups. The alkyl group as R4 or R5 may have one or two or more substituents selected from a halogen atom, carboxy group, sulfonyl group, hydroxy group, amino group, an alkoxy group, and the like, and the alkyl group as R4 or R5 may be, for example, a halogenated alkyl group, a hydroxyalkyl group, a carboxyalkyl group, or the like. When R4 or R5 represents an aryl group, the aryl group may be a monocyclic aromatic group, or a condensed ring aromatic group, and the aryl ring may contain one or two or more ring-constituting heteroatoms (for example, nitrogen atom, sulfur atom, oxygen atom and the like). As the aryl group, phenyl group is preferred. The aryl ring may have one or two or more substituents on the ring. As the substituents, for example, one or two or more substituents selected from a halogen atom, carboxy group, sulfonyl group, hydroxy group, amino group, an alkoxy group, and the like may exist. R6 and R7 independently represent hydrogen atom, an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, or a halogen atom, and these are the same as those explained for R2 and R3. X represents silicon atom, germanium atom, or tin atom. It is preferably silicon atom. R8 represents a substituent that acts as a trapping group for an object substance for measurement, hydrogen atom, an alkylcarbonyl group, or an alkylcarbonyloxymethyl group. As the alkylcarbonyl group, for example, an alkylcarbonyl group having about 1 to 13 carbon atoms, preferably about 1 to 7 carbon atoms, more preferably about 1 to 5 carbon atoms, can be used. The same shall apply to the alkylcarbonyl group in the alkylcarbonyloxymethyl group. For example, acetoxymethyl group and the like can be preferably used. The compounds represented by the general formula (I) wherein R8 is an alkylcarbonyl group or an alkylcarbonyloxymethyl group show higher lipophilicity, and such compounds more easily pass the cell membrane and are more easily incorporated into the inside of the cell. Therefore, when an object substance for measurement in a cell is measured by a bioimaging technique, the compounds wherein R8 is an alkylcarbonyl group or an alkylcarbonyloxymethyl group can be preferably used. The compounds represented by the aforementioned general formula (I) may exist as a salt. Examples of the salt include base addition salts, acid addition salts, amino acid salts, and the like. Examples of the base addition salts include, for example, metal salts such as sodium salt, potassium salt, calcium salt and magnesium salt, ammonium salts, and organic amine salts such as triethylamine salt, piperidine salt, and morpholine salt, and examples of the acid addition salts include, for example, mineral acid salts such as hydrochloride, sulfate, and nitrate, and organic acid salts such as methanesulfonate, para-toluenesulfonate, citrate, and oxalate. As the amino acid salt, glycine salt, and the like can be exemplified. However, the salts of the compounds of the present invention are not limited to these examples. The compounds of the present invention represented by the general formula (I) may have one or two or more asymmetric carbons depending to types of substituents, and they may exist as a stereoisomer such as enantiomer or diastereoisomer. Stereoisomers in pure form, arbitrary mixtures of stereoisomers, racemates, and the like all fall within the scope of the present invention. Further, the compounds of the present invention represented by the general formula (I) or (II) and salts thereof may exist as a hydrate or a solvate, and all of these substances are encompassed by the scope of the present invention. Type of the solvent that forms the solvate is not particularly limited, and examples include, for example, such solvents as ethanol, acetone, and isopropanol. The compounds represented by the general formula (I) and salts thereof of the present invention have a property that they are substantially non-fluorescent before trapping an object substance for measurement, and emit red fluorescence of high intensity after trapping an object substance for measurement. Therefore, they can be used as a fluorescent probe for measurement of an object substance for measurement. The term “measurement” used in this specification must be construed in its broadest sense including quantification, qualification, as well as measurement, examination, detection, and the like performed for the purposes of diagnosis and the like. The method for measuring an object substance for measurement utilizing the fluorescent probe of the present invention generally comprises (a) the step of contacting a compound represented by the aforementioned formula (I) with an object substance for measurement to make the trapping group among the substituents represented by R1 and/or the trapping group as R8 trap the object substance for measurement, and (b) the step of measuring fluorescence of a compound generated in the aforementioned step (a) (corresponding to a compound in which a metal ion is chelated with the trapping group among the substituents represented by R1, a compound of which chemical structure is changed after trapping of an object substance for measurement, for example, a compound undergone a chemical modification such as ring formation or ring opening, and/or a compound undergone such a chemical modification as cleavage of R8 after trapping of an object substance for measurement). For example, the fluorescent probe of the present invention or a salt thereof can be dissolved in an aqueous medium such as physiological saline and buffer, a mixture of a water-miscible organic solvent such as ethanol, acetone, ethylene glycol, dimethyl sulfoxide, and dimethylformamide, and an aqueous medium, or the like, this solution can be added to an appropriate buffer containing cells or tissues, and fluorescence spectrum can be measured before and after contact with the object substance for measurement. Fluorescence of the compound after trapping of an object substance for measurement can be measured by a usual method, and a method of measuring a fluorescence spectrum in vitro, a method of measuring a fluorescence spectrum in vivo by using a bioimaging technique, and the like can be employed. For example, when quantification is performed, it is desirable to create a calibration curve beforehand in a conventional manner. For example, excitation wavelength may be about 582 nm, and fluorescence at a fluorescence wavelength of about 598 nm can be measured. The fluorescent probe of the present invention may be mixed with additives usually used for preparation of reagents when required, and used as a composition. For example, as additives for using a reagent in a physiological environment, such additives as dissolving aids, pH modifiers, buffering agents, and isotonic agents can be used, and amounts of these can be appropriately selected by those skilled in the art. Such a composition is provided as a composition in an appropriate form such as powdery mixture, lyophilized product, granule, tablet, and solution.

As clearly seen from the results shown in Table 1 and FIG. 1, the fluorescence quantum yields of the compounds changed depending on the oxidation potentials of the benzene ring moiety. The results are summarized as follows: a) the compounds were non-fluorescent at an oxidation potential of 1.26 V or lower, and the fluorescence quantum yield was as small as 0.14 even at 1.57 V, b) the fluorescence quantum yield was fixed at the maximum value (about 0.4) at an oxidation potential of 1.98 V or higher, and the fluorescence quantum yield was as large as 0.31 even at 1.75 V. The above results demonstrated that a PeT type fluorescence off/on type fluorescent probe could be designed with reference to the oxidation potential of the benzene ring moiety.

Ca2+-dependent changes of absorption spectra and fluorescence spectra of CaTM-1 (a) and CaTM-2 (b) were measured in a 30 mM 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MPOS) buffer (pH 7.2) containing 100 mM potassium chloride and 10 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) at 22° C. in the presence of various concentrations of free Ca2+ ions (0, 0.017, 0.038, 0.065, 0.100, 0.150, 0.225, 0.351, 0.602, 1.35, and 39 μM).

Although absorption spectra of both CaTM-1 (a) and CaTM-2 (b) were not changed by change of Ca2+ ion concentration, fluorescence intensity was increased with increasing of Ca2+ ion concentration. Thus, it was confirmed that they functioned as a fluorescent probe for measuring calcium ions in a sample by using fluorescence.

A HeLa cell loaded with 3 μM CaTM-2-AM ((a) to (d)) or Rhod-2-AM ((e) to (h)) in HBSS was stimulated with histamine (1 μM). The results are shown in FIG. 8. Further, localization of CaTM-2-AM (a) and Rhod-2-AM (b) in live A549 cells loaded with each of them was investigated by measuring fluorescence. The results are shown in FIG. 9. It can be seen that, as shown in FIGS. 9, (b), (c), (d), and (e), Rhod-2 (produced by hydrolysis of Rhod-2-AM incorporated into cell with esterase) accumulated in mitochondria, since it showed the same distribution as that of MitoTraker, which selectively accumulates in mitochondria, whereas, as shown in FIG. 9, (a), CaTM-2 (produced by hydrolysis of CaTM-2-AM incorporated into cell with esterase) uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm. These results demonstrated that CaTM-2-AM was suitable as a fluorescent probe for measuring calcium concentration in the cytoplasm. Further, as shown in FIGS. 8, (a) to (d), CaTM-2 more sharply detected the calcium vibration induced by histamine stimulation compared with Rhod-2 (FIGS. 8, (e) to (h)), and therefore it was demonstrated that CaTM-2 had superior performance as a fluorescent probe for measuring calcium ions. Further, by performing imaging of intracellular calcium in red color by loading CaTM-2 AM on HeLa cells transfected with CFP-nucleus (blue) and YFP-Golgi apparatus (yellow), imaging results colored in three kinds of colors was obtained (FIG. 10), and it was demonstrated that simultaneous imaging using three kinds of fluorescent probes showing different fluorescence wavelengths was possible. The result of continuous imaging of calcium ions performed by the patch clamping method in a cell membrane adhered state is shown in FIG. 11. Generation of neuronal action potential induced by transient change of calcium ion concentration in the cell was observed with sufficient sensitivity by the fluorescence method using CaTM-2. Furthermore, the results of multi-color imaging of CA3 pyramidal tract cell layer in a hippocampus culture section performed by using CaTM-2-AM and acridine orange are shown in FIG. 12. The photograph of (a) shows the image obtained with CaTM-2-AM (red), the photograph of (b) shows the image obtained with acridine orange (green), and the photograph of (c) shows the image obtained by piling up the foregoing images. The diagram of (d) shows results of measurement of spontaneous action potential generated from the nine neurons numbered in the photograph of (a) measured as change of intracellular calcium ion concentration at 10 Hz by utilizing fluorescence of CaTM-2.
