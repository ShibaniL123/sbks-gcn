[4] Synthesis of N2-phenoxyacetyl-5'-O-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-2'-O-(2-cyanoethoxymethoxymethyl)guanosine 3'-O-(2-cyanoethyl N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidite) (I-3)
N2-phenoxyacetyl-5'-O-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-2'-O-(2-cyanoethoxymethoxymethyl)guanosine (3d) (800 mg, 0.96 mmol) was azeotropically distilled with acetonitrile, and dried in vacuo. This operation was performed twice. To the thus-obtained mixture were added diisopropylammoniumtetrazolide (180 mg, 1.1 mmol) and acetonitrile (3 mL) under an argon atmosphere, 2-cyanoethyl-N,N,N',N'-tetraisopropylphosphordiamidite (0.61 mL, 1.9 mmol) was further added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hr. After completion of the reaction, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, ethyl acetate was added and the mixture was washed once with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and once with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. The organic layer after washing was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:ethyl acetate=1:10, containing 0.1% triethylamine) to give the object compound (I-3) (803 mg, purity 98.3%, yield 81%). The instrumental analytical values of compound (I-3) are shown below.
