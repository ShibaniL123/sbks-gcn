Step 3: 1-(2-chloropyrimidin-4-yl)-3-methyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2(3H)-one
1-(2-Chloropyrimidin-4-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2(3H)-one (600 mg, 2.43 mmol) was dispersed in anhydrous DMF (10 mL) and cooled in an ice-water bath. Sodium hydride (116 mg, 60%, 2.90 mmol) was added thereto and the resulting mixture was stirred for 1 hour. Then iodomethane (345 mg, 2.43 mmol) was added dropwise and stirring was continued for 1 hour. The reaction solution was poured into water (50 mL), the resulting mixture was stirred for 30 minutes and then suction-filtered, and the filter cake was washed with water (30 mL * 3) and dried to give the title compound (459 mg, 72%).
