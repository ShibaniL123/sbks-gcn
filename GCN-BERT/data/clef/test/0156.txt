BIOMARKERS FOR THE TREATMENT OF HEPATOCELLULAR CARCINOMA 1. FIELD [0001] Provided herein are biomarkers for hepatocellular carcinoma and uses thereof. 2. BACKGROUND [0002] Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), also known as malignant hepatoma, is the most common primary malignancy of the liver and accounts for 80-90% of primary liver tumors. HCC is one of the most common and devastating malignant diseases worldwide, responsible for more than 1 million deaths annually in the world (Parkin et αℓ., CA Cancer J. Clin.1999,49, 33-64; Bruix et αℓ., Cancer Cell2004, 5, 215-219). [0003] The major risk factors for the development of HCC include hepatitis Β or C viral infection, and alcoholic liver disease (Rustgi, Gastroenterol. Clin. North Am.1987,16, 545-551; Bosch et αℓ., Semin. Liver Dis.1999,19, 271-285; Bosch et αℓ., Gastroenterology2004,127, S5-S16; Moradpour et αℓ., Eur. J. Gastro & Hepatol. 2005, 17, 477-483; Koike et al.,J. Gastroenterol. Hepatol.2008,23, S87-S91; de Oliveria Andrade, J. Glob. Infect. Dis.2009,1, 33-37). HCC arises most commonly in cirrhotic livers following infection with hepatitis Β virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Liaw, Semin. Liver Dis.2005,25, 40-47; Koike Clin. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2005, 3, 132-135). HCC is associated with HBV infection in about 50% of cases (Liaw, Semin. Liver Dis.2005,25, 40-47). HCV infection is the cause of 70% of the cases of HCC in Japan (Hasan, et αℓ., Hepatology, 1990, 12:589-591; El-Serag et αℓ., Ν. Engl. J. Med. 1999, 340, 745-750). The HCC incidence has been increasing in Western countries in recent years due to the spread of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (El-Serag, Hepatology2002,36, S74-83; Trevisani et αℓ., Carcinogenesis2008,29, 1299-1305). [0004] Hepatocellular carcinoma is a disease of worldwide significance, of which there is no truly effective therapy, particularly for advanced disease. Therefore, there is a need for biomarkers to aid a HCC treatment and a method of predicting the responsiveness of a HCC patient to a HCC treatment, e.g., chemotherapy. 3.

[0033] In certain embodiments, the methods provided herein are based on comparison of the level of one or more biomarkers in a biological sample from a subject having or suspected to have hepatocellular carcinoma to a reference level of the biomarkers or the level of a control. The biomarker level is used to determine or to predict, for example, the likelihood of the subject’s responsiveness to a treatment compound, such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or 3-(5-amino-2-methyl-4-oxo-4/7-quinazolin-3-yl)-pipcridinc-2,6-dionc, or a stereoisomer thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, co-crystal, clathrate, or a polymorph thereof. 4.1 Brief Description of Figures [0034] FIG. 1 shows the change in TCF-4 transcription factor-levels in HCC cell lines, Focus and Hub7, upon treatment with lenalidomide (“LM”).

[0058] The term “therapeutically effective amount” of a compound refers to the amount of a compound that, when administered, is sufficient to prevent development of, or alleviate to some extent, one or more of the symptoms of a disease, e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma, being treated. The term also refers to the amount of a compound that is sufficient to elicit the biological or medical response of a biological molecule (e.g., a protein, enzyme, RNA, or DNA), cell, tissue, system, animal, or human, which is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor, or clinician. Furthermore, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound means an amount of a therapeutic agent, alone or in combination with other therapies, which provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment or management of a disease, e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma. The term encompasses an amount that improves overall therapy, reduces, or avoids symptoms or causes of a disease, e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma, or enhances the therapeutic efficacy of another therapeutic agent. [0059] The term “level” refers to the amount, accumulation, or rate of a biomarker molecule. A level can be represented, for example, by the amount or the rate of synthesis of a massager RNA (mRNA) encoded by a gene, the amount or the rate of synthesis of a polypeptide or protein encoded by a gene, or the amount or the rate of synthesis of a biological molecule accumulated in a cell or biological fluid. The term "level" refers to an absolute amount of a molecule in a sample or to a relative amount of the molecule, determined under steady-state or non-steady-state conditions. [0060] The term “responsiveness” or “responsive” when used in reference to a treatment refer to the degree of effectiveness of the treatment in lessening or decreasing the symptoms of a disease, e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma, being treated. For example, the term “increased responsiveness” when used in reference to a treatment of a cell or a subject refers to an increase in the effectiveness in lessening or decreasing the symptoms of the disease when measured using any methods known in the art. In certain embodiments, the increase in the effectiveness is at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, or at least about 50%. [0061] The term “effective patient response” refers to an increase in the therapeutic benefit to a patient in treating a disease, e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma. In certain embodiments, the increase is at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 40%, or at least about 50%. An “effective patient tumor response” can be, for example, an about 5%, about 10%, about 25%, about 50%, or about 100% decrease in one or more physical symptoms of the disease or the tumor size. [0062] The term “likelihood” refers to an increase in the probability of an event. The term “likelihood” when used in reference to the effectiveness of a patient response to a treatment of a disease, e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma, contemplates an increased probability that the symptoms of the disease will be lessened or decreased. [0063] The term “predict” generally means to determine or tell in advance. When used to “predict” the effectiveness of the treatment of a disease (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma), for example, the term “predict” can mean that the likelihood of the outcome of the treatment can be determined at the outset, before the treatment has begun, or before the treatment period has progressed substantially. [0064] The term “polypeptide,” “protein,” or “peptide,” as used herein interchangeably, refers to a polymer of two or more amino acids in a serial array, linked through one or more peptide bond(s). The term encompasses proteins, protein fragments, protein analogues, oligopeptides, and peptides. The amino acids of the polypeptide, protein, or peptide can be naturally occurring amino acids or synthetic amino acids (e.g., mimics of naturally occurring amino acids). The polypeptide, protein, or peptide can be made synthetically or purified from a biological sample. The polypeptide, protein, or peptide also encompasses modified polypeptides, proteins, and peptides,, e.g., a glycopolypeptide, glycoprotein, or glycopeptide; or a lipopolypeptide, lipoprotein, or lipopeptide. [0065] The term “antibody” refers to a polypeptide that specifically binds an epitope (e.g., an antigen). The term “antibody” is used herein in the broadest sense and covers fully assembled antibodies, antibody fragments which retain the ability to specifically bind to an antigen (e.g., Fab, F(ab')2, Fv, and other fragments), single chain antibodies, diabodies, antibody chimeras, hybrid antibodies, bispecific antibodies, and humanized antibodies. The term “antibody” also covers both polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. [0066] The term “expressed” or “expression” refers to the transcription from a gene to give an RNA nucleic acid molecule, e.g., mRNA, at least complementary in part to a region of one of the two nucleic acid strands of the gene. The term “expressed” or “expression” as used herein also refers to the translation from an RNA molecule to give a protein, a polypeptide or a portion thereof. [0067] An mRNA that is “unregulated” generally refers to an increase in the level of express of the mRNA in response to a given treatment or condition. An mRNA that is “downregulated” generally refers to a “decrease” in the level of expression of the mRNA in response to a given treatment or condition. In some situations, the mRNA level can remain unchanged upon a given treatment or condition. An mRNA from a patient sample can be “unregulated,” i.e., the level of mRNA can be increased, for example, by about 5%, about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 90%, about 100%, about 200%, about 300%, about 500%, about 1,000%, about 5,000% or more of the comparative control mRNA level or a reference level. Alternatively, an mRNA can be “downregulated,” i.e., the level of mRNA level can be decreased, for example, by about 99%, about 95%, about 90%, about 80%, about 70%, about 60%, about 50%, about 40%, about 30%, about 20%, about 10%, about 5%, about 2%, about 1% or less of the comparative control mRNA level or a reference level. [0068] Similarly, the level of a polypeptide, protein, or peptide from a patient sample can be increased as compared to a control or a reference level. This increase can be about 5%, about 10%, about 20%, about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 60%, about 70%, about 90%, about 100%, about 200%, about 300%, about 500%, about 1,000%, about 5,000% or more of the comparative control protein level or a reference level. Alternatively, the level of a protein biomarker can be decreased. This decrease can be, for example, present at a level of about 99%, about 95%, about 90%, about 80%, about 70%, about 60%, about 50%, about 40%, about 30%, about 20%, about 10%, about 5%, about 2%, about 1% or less of the comparative control protein level or a reference level. [0069] The terms “determining”, “measuring”, “evaluating”, “assessing” and “assaying” are used interchangeably herein to refer to a form of measurement, including determining if an element is present or not. The measurement can be quantitative and/or qualitative determinations. “Assessing the presence of’ can include determining the amount of something present, as well as determining whether it is present or absent. [0070] The terms “nucleic acid” and “polynucleotide” are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of nucleotides, e.g., deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides, or compounds, which can hybridize with a naturally occurring nucleic acid in a sequence specific manner analogous to that of two naturally occurring nucleic acids, e.g., participating in Watson-Crick base pairing interactions. As used herein in the context of a polynucleotide sequence, the term “bases” (or “base”) is synonymous with “nucleotides” (or “nucleotide”), i.e., the monomer subunit of a polynucleotide. The terms “nucleoside” and “nucleotide” are intended to include those moieties that contain not only the known purine and pyrimidine bases, but also other heterocyclic bases that have been modified. Such modifications include methylated purines or pyrimidines, acylated purines or pyrimidines, alkylated riboses or other heterocycles. In addition, the terms “nucleoside” and “nucleotide” include those moieties that contain not only conventional ribose and deoxyribose sugars, but other sugars as well. Modified nucleosides or nucleotides also include modifications on the sugar moiety, e.g., wherein one or more of the hydroxyl groups are replaced with halogen atoms or aliphatic groups, or are functionalized as ethers, amines, or the like. The term “analogue” of a “nucleic acid” or “polynucleotide” refers to a molecule having a structural feature that is recognized in the literature as being a mimetic, derivative, having an analogous structure, or other like terms, and includes, for example, a polynucleotide incorporating a non-natural nucleotide, a nucleotide mimetic such as a 2'-modified nucleoside, peptide nucleic acid, oligomeric nucleoside phosphonate, and any polynucleotide that has added substituent groups, such as protecting groups or linking moieties. [0071 ] The term “complementary” refers to specific binding between polynucleotides based on the sequences of the polynucleotides. As used herein, a first polynucleotide and a second polynucleotide are complementary if they bind to each other in a hybridization assay under stringent conditions, e.g., if they produce a given or detectable level of signal in a hybridization assay. Portions of polynucleotides are complementary to each other if they follow conventional base-pairing rules, e.g., A pairs with Τ (or U) and G pairs with C, although small regions (e.g. less than about 3 bases) of mismatch, insertion, or deleted sequence may be present. [0072] The term “sequence identity” or “identity” in the context of two nucleic acid sequences refers to the residues in the two sequences which are the same when aligned for maximum correspondence over a specified comparison window, and can take into consideration additions, deletions and substitutions. [0073] The term “substantial identity” or “homologous” in their various grammatical forms in the context of polynucleotides generally means that a polynucleotide comprises a sequence that has a desired identity, for example, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90% and at least 95% sequence identity, compared to a reference sequence. Another indication that nucleotide sequences are substantially identical is if two molecules hybridize to each other under stringent conditions. [0074] As used herein, the term “bound” can be used herein to indicate direct or indirect attachment. In the context of chemical structures, “bound” (or “bonded”) may refer to the existence of a chemical bond directly joining two moieties or indirectly joining two moieties (e.g., via a linking group or any other intervening portion of the molecule). The chemical bond may be a covalent bond, an ionic bond, a coordination complex, hydrogen bonding, van der Waals interactions, or hydrophobic stacking, or may exhibit characteristics of multiple types of chemical bonds. In certain instances, “bound” includes embodiments where the attachment is direct and also embodiments where the attachment is indirect. [0075] The terms “isolated” and “purified” refer to isolation of a substance (such as mRNA or protein) such that the substance comprises a substantial portion of the sample in which it resides, i.e., greater than the substance is typically found in its natural or unisolated state. Typically, a substantial portion of the sample comprises, e.g., greater than about 1%, greater than about 2%, greater than about 5%, greater than about 10%, greater than about 20%, greater than about 50%, or more, usually up to about 90% to 100% of the sample. For example, a sample of isolated mRNA can typically comprise at least about 1% total mRNA. Techniques for purifying polynucleotides are well known in the art and include, for example, gel electrophoresis, ion-exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, flow sorting, and sedimentation according to density. [0076] The term “biological sample” as used herein refers to a sample obtained from a biological subject, including a sample of biological tissue or fluid origin, obtained, reached, or collected in vivo or in situ. A biological sample also includes samples from a region of a biological subject containing precancerous or cancer cells or tissues. Such samples can be, but are not limited to, organs, tissues, fractions and cells isolated from a mammal. Exemplary biological samples include, but are not limited to, cell lysate, a cell culture, a cell line, a tissue, oral tissue, gastrointestinal tissue, an organ, an organelle, a biological fluid, a blood sample, a urine sample, a skin sample, and the like. In certain embodiments, biological samples include, but are not limited to, whole blood, partially purified blood, PBMCs, tissue biopsies, and the like. [0077] The term “analyte” as used herein, refers to a known or unknown component of a sample. [0078] The term “capture agent,” as used herein, refers to an agent that binds an mRNA or protein through an interaction that is sufficient to permit the agent to bind and concentrate the mRNA or protein from a homogeneous mixture. [0079] The term “probe” as used herein, refers to a capture agent that is directed to a specific target mRNA biomarker sequence. Accordingly, each probe of a probe set has a respective target mRNA biomarker. A probe/target mRNA duplex is a structure formed by hybridizing a probe to its target mRNA biomarker. [0080] The term “nucleic acid probe” or “oligonucleotide probe” refers to a nucleic acid capable of binding to a target nucleic acid of complementary sequence, such as the mRNA biomarkers provided herein, through one or more types of chemical bonds, usually through complementary base pairing, usually through hydrogen bond formation. As used herein, a probe may include natural (e.g., A, G, C, or Τ) or modified bases (7-deazaguanosine, inosine, etc.). In addition, the bases in a probe may be joined by a linkage other than a phosphodiester bond, so long as it does not interfere with hybridization. It will be understood by one of skill in the art that probes may bind target sequences lacking complete complementarity with the probe sequence depending upon the stringency of the hybridization conditions. The probes are preferably directly labeled with isotopes, for example, chromophores, lumiphores, chromogens, or indirectly labeled with biotin to which a streptavidin complex may later bind. By assaying for the presence or absence of the probe, one can detect the presence or absence of a target mRNA biomarker of interest. [0081] The term “stringent assay conditions” refers to conditions that are compatible to produce binding pairs of nucleic acids, e.g., probes and target mRNAs, of sufficient complementarity to provide for the desired level of specificity in the assay while being generally incompatible to the formation of binding pairs between binding members of insufficient complementarity to provide for the desired specificity. The term “stringent assay conditions” generally refers to the combination of hybridization and wash conditions. [0082] A “label” or a “detectable moiety” in reference to a nucleic acid, refers to a composition that, when linked with a nucleic acid, renders the nucleic acid detectable, for example, by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, immunochemical, or chemical means. Exemplary labels include, but are not limited to, radioactive isotopes, magnetic beads, metallic beads, colloidal particles, fluorescent dyes, enzymes, biotin, digoxigenin, haptens, and the like. A “labeled nucleic acid or oligonucleotide probe” is generally one that is bound, either covalently, through a linker or a chemical bond, or noncovalently, through ionic bonds, van der Waals forces, electrostatic attractions, hydrophobic interactions, or hydrogen bonds, to a label such that the presence of the nucleic acid or probe can be detected by detecting the presence of the label bound to the nucleic acid or probe. [0083] The terms “polymerase chain reaction” or “PCR,” as used herein generally refers to a procedure wherein small amounts of a nucleic acid, RNA and/or DNA, are amplified as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,195 to Mullis. Generally, sequence information from the ends of the region of interest or beyond needs to be available, such that oligonucleotide primers can be designed; these primers will be identical or similar in sequence to opposite strands of the template to be amplified. The 5' terminal nucleotides of the two primers may coincide with the ends of the amplified material. PCR can be used to amplify specific RNA sequences, specific DNA sequences from total genomic DNA, and cDNA transcribed from total cellular RNA, bacteriophage or plasmid sequences, etc. See generally Mullis et αℓ., Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol., 51: 263 (1987); Erlich, ed., PCR Technology, (Stockton Press, NY, 1989). [0084] The term “cycle number” or “CT” when used herein in reference to PCR methods, refers to the PCR cycle number at which the fluorescence level passes a given set threshold level. The CT measurement can be used, for example, to approximate levels of mRNA in an original sample. The CT measurement is often used in terms of “dCT” or the “difference in the CT” score, when the CT of one nucleic acid is subtracted from the CT of another nucleic acid. [0085] The term “about” or “approximately” means an acceptable error for a particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, which depends in part on how the value is measured or determined. In certain embodiments, the term “about” or “approximately” means within 1, 2, 3, or 4 standard deviations. In certain embodiments, the term “about” or “approximately” means within 50%, 20%, 15%, 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 1%, 0.5%, or 0.05% of a given value or range. [0086] The term “TCF” or “T-cell factor” refers to a member of TCF/LEF family proteins, or a variant thereof. The term “TCF variant” is intended to include proteins substantially homologous to a native TCF, i.e., proteins having one or more naturally or non-naturally occurring amino acid deletions, insertions, or substitutions (e.g., TCF derivatives, homologs, and fragments), as compared to the amino acid sequence of a native TCF. The amino acid sequence of a TCF variant is at least about 80% identical, at least about 90% identical, or at least about 95% identical to a native TCF.

In certain embodiments, the reference level is determined from a sample from a group of subjects that contains no hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In certain embodiments, the reference level is determined from a sample from a group of subjects who do not have hepatocellular carcinoma. An increased level of the biomarker correlates positively with increased responsiveness of the subject to a treatment by a treatment compound, e.g., thalidomide, lenalidomide, pomalidomide, or 3-(5-amino-2-mcthyl-4-oxo-4//quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidine-2,6-dione, or a stereoisomer thereof, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, hydrate, co-crystal, clathrate, or a polymorph thereof. [00127] In certain embodiments, the control sample is a sample containing no hepatocellular carcinoma cells from the same subject. In certain embodiments, the control sample is a sample of liver cells containing no hepatocellular carcinoma cells from the same subject. In certain embodiments, the control sample is a sample containing no hepatocellular carcinoma cells from a group of subjects. In certain embodiments, the control sample is a sample of liver cells containing no hepatocellular carcinoma cells from a group of subjects. In certain embodiments, the control sample is a sample from a subject having no hepatocellular carcinoma. In certain embodiments, the control sample is a sample of liver cells from a subject having no hepatocellular carcinoma.

Exemplary methods include, but are not limited to, northern blots, ribonuclease protection assays, and PCR-based methods. When the biomarker is an mRNA molecule, the mRNA sequence, or a fragment thereof, can be used to prepare a probe that is at least partially complementary. The probe can then be used to detect the mRNA sequence in a sample, using any suitable assay, such as PCR-based methods, Northern blotting, or a dipstick assay. [00296] The assay method can be varied depending on the type of mRNA information desired. Exemplary methods include, but are not limited to, Northern blots and PCR-based methods (e.g., qRT-PCR). Methods such as qRT-PCR can also accurately quantitate the amount of the mRNA in a sample. [00297] Any suitable assay platform can be used to determine the presence of the mRNA in a sample. For example, an assay may be in the form of a dipstick, a membrane, a chip, a disk, a test strip, a filter, a microsphere, a slide, a multiwell plate, or an optical fiber. An assay system may have a solid support on which a nucleic acid corresponding to the mRNA is attached. The solid support may comprise, for example, a plastic, silicon, a metal, a resin, glass, a membrane, a particle, a precipitate, a gel, a polymer, a sheet, a sphere, a polysaccharide, a capillary, a film a plate, or a slide. The assay components can be prepared and packaged together as a kit for detecting an mRNA. [00298] The nucleic acid can be labeled, if desired, to make a population of labeled mRNAs. In general, a sample can be labeled using methods that are well known in the art (e.g., using DNA ligase, terminal transferase, or by labeling the RNA backbone, etc.; see, e.g., Ausubel, et αℓ., Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 3rd ed., Wiley & Sons 1995 and Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Third Edition, 2001 Cold Spring Harbor, Ν.Υ.). In certain embodiments, the sample is labeled with fluorescent label. Exemplary fluorescent dyes include, but are not limited to, xanthene dyes, fluorescein dyes, rhodamine dyes, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM), 6-carboxy-2',4',7',4,7-hexachlorofluorescein (HEX), 6-carboxy-4',5'-dichloro-2',7'-dimethoxyfluorescein (JOE or J), X,X,X',X-tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine (TAMRA or Τ), 6-carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX or R), 5-carboxyrhodamine 6G (R6G5 or G5), 6-carboxyrhodamine 6G (R6G6 or G6), and rhodamine 110; cyanine dyes, e.g. Cy3, Cy5 and Cy7 dyes; Alexa dyes, e.g. Alexa-fluor-555; coumarin, diethylaminocoumarin, umbelliferone; benzimide dyes, e.g. Hoechst 33258; phenanthridine dyes, e.g., Texas red; ethidium dyes; acridine dyes; carbazole dyes; phenoxazine dyes; porphyrin dyes; polymethine dyes, BODIPY dyes, quinoline dyes, pyrene, fluorescein chlorotriazinyl, R110, Eosin, JOE, R6G, tetramethylrhodamine, lissamine, ROX, and napthofluorescein. [00299] The nucleic acids may be present in specific, addressable locations on a solid support; each corresponding to at least a portion of mRNA sequences of a biomarker. [00300] In certain embodiments, an mRNA assay comprises the steps of 1) obtaining surface-bound probes for one or more biomarkers; 2) hybridizing a population of mRNAs to the surface-bound probes under conditions sufficient to provide for specific binding; (3) removing unbound nucleic acids in the hybridization step; and (4) detecting the hybridized mRNAs. [00301] Hybridization can be carried out under suitable hybridization conditions, which may vary in stringency as desired. Typical conditions are sufficient to produce probe/target complexes on a solid surface between complementary binding members, i.e., between surface-bound probes and complementary mRNAs in a sample. [00302] In certain embodiments, stringent hybridization conditions are used. Standard hybridization techniques (e.g., under conditions sufficient to provide for specific binding of target mRNAs in the sample to the probes) are described in Kallioniemi et αℓ., Science 258:818-821 (1992) and WO 93/18186, the disclosure of each which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Several guides to general techniques are available, e.g., Tijssen, Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes, Parts I and II (Elsevier, Amsterdam 1993). For descriptions of techniques suitable for in situ hybridizations, see Gall et αℓ. Meth. Enzymol., 21:470-480 (1981); and Angerer et αℓ. in Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods (Setlow and Hollaender, Eds.) Vol 7, pages 43-65 (Plenum Press, New York 1985). Selection of appropriate conditions, including temperature, salt concentration, polynucleotide concentration, hybridization time, and stringency of washing conditions, depends on experimental design, including the source of a sample, the identity of capture agents, the degree of complementarity expected, etc., and may be determined as a matter of routine experimentation for those of ordinary skill in the art. [00303] After the mRNA hybridization procedure, the surface bound polynucleotides are washed to remove unbound nucleic acids. Washing may be performed using any convenient washing protocol. In certain embodiments, the washing conditions are stringent. The hybridization of the target mRNAs to the probes is then detected using standard techniques. 4.5.2 PCR-based Methods of Detecting mRNA Levels in a Sample [00304] In certain embodiments, the mRNA level of a biomarker is determined using a PCR-based method. Examples of PCR assays can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,927,024, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Examples of RT-PCR methods can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 7,122,799, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Examples of fluorescent in situ PCR methods can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 7,186,507, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. [00305] In certain embodiments, real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) is used for both the detection and quantification of mRNAs (Bustin, et αℓ., Clin. Sci.,2005,109, 365-379). Quantitative results obtained by qRT-PCR are generally more informative than qualitative data. Examples of qRT-PCR-based methods can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 7,101,663, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. [00306] In contrast to regular reverse transcriptase-PCR and analysis by agarose gels, real-time PCR gives quantitative results. An additional advantage of real-time PCR is the relative ease and convenience of use. Instruments for real-time PCR, such as Applied Biosystems 7500, are available commercially. The reagents for real-time PCR, such as TaqMan Sequence Detection chemistry, are also commercially available. [00307] To determine the cycle number at which the fluorescence signal associated with a particular amplicon accumulation crosses the threshold (referred to as CT), the data can be analyzed, for example, using a 7500 Real-Time PCR System Sequence Detection software vl.3, using the comparative CT relative quantification calculation method. Using this method, the output is expressed as a fold-change in expression levels. In some embodiments, the threshold level can be selected to be automatically determined by the software. In some embodiments, the threshold level is set to be above the baseline, but sufficiently low to be within the exponential growth region of an amplification curve. 4.5.3 Methods of detecting polypeptide or protein biomarkers [00308] When the biomarker is a protein, polypeptide, or peptide, several protein detection and quantitation methods can be used to measure the level of the biomarker. Any suitable protein quantitation method can be used in the methods provided herein. In certain embodiments, antibody-based methods are used. Exemplary methods that can be used include, but are not limited to, immunoblotting (western blot), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, cytometric bead array, and mass spectroscopy. Several types of ELISA are commonly used, including direct ELISA, indirect ELISA, and sandwich ELISA. 4.6 Kits for Detecting Biomarker Levels [00309] In certain embodiments, provided herein is a kit for detecting the mRNA level of one or more biomarkers. In certain embodiments, the kit comprises one or more probes that bind specifically to the mRNAs of the one or more biomarkers. In certain embodiments, the kit further comprises a washing solution. In certain embodiments, the kit further comprises reagents for performing a hybridization assay, mRNA isolation or purification means, detection means, as well as positive and negative controls. In certain embodiments, the kit further comprises an instruction for using the kit. The kit can be tailored for in-home use, clinical use, or research use. [00310] In certain embodiments, provided herein is a kit for detecting the protein level of one or more biomarkers. In certain embodiments, the kits comprises a dipstick coated with an antibody that recognizes the protein biomarker, washing solutions, reagents for performing the assay, protein isolation or purification means, detection means, as well as positive and negative controls. In certain embodiments, the kit further comprises an instruction for using the kit. The kit can be tailored for in-home use, clinical use, or research use. [00311] Such a kit can employ, for example, a dipstick, a membrane, a chip, a disk, a test strip, a filter, a microsphere, a slide, a multiwell plate, or an optical fiber. The solid support of the kit can be, for example, a plastic, silicon, a metal, a resin, glass, a membrane, a particle, a precipitate, a gel, a polymer, a sheet, a sphere, a polysaccharide, a capillary, a film, a plate, or a slide. The biological sample can be, for example, a cell culture, a cell line, a tissue, an oral tissue, gastrointestinal tissue, an organ, an organelle, a biological fluid, a blood sample, a urine sample, or a skin sample. 5. EXAMPLES [00312] The examples below are carried out using standard techniques, which are well known and routine to those of skill in the art, except where otherwise described in detail. The examples are intended to be merely illustrative. 5.1 Effect of lenalidomide on TCF-4 transcription factor in HCC cell lines [00313] Focus and Hub7 cells were treated with 10 μΜ of lenalidomide (“LM”) in DMSO or DMSO as a control for 24 hrs. Nuclear and cytosolic proteins were separately extracted and the expression of TCF-4 was analyzed by western blot. Nuclear expression of both long and short isoforms of TCF-4 was qualified using ImageJ (NIH) and normalized by expression of lamin. As shown in FIG. 1, upon LM treatment, TCF-4 expression, short and long forms, was decreased in poorly-differentiated cells (Focus). 5.2 Effect of lenalidomide and 3-(5-amino-2-methyl-4-oxo-4//quinazolin-3-yl)-piperidine-2,6-dione on cell migration and invasion [00314] Cell Migration Assay: Focus and Hub7 cells were treated with 10 μΜ of LM in DMSO or DMSO as a control for 24 hrs. The cells were transferred in a migration chamber (BD Biosciences). The lower chamber was filled with 10% FBS-containing medium as a chemoattractant and was separated from the upper chamber by a 8 pm pore membrane. After 16 hrs, the remaining cells in the upper chamber (non-migrated cells) were removed and the cell attached to the bottom of the membrane (migrated cells) were stained with crystal violet and counted using Stereologer (SRC) in 10 different fields of the membrane. As shown in FIG. 2, LM treatment inhibited cell migration in a poorly differentiated HCC cell line (Focus). [00315] Cell Invasion Assay: Focus and Hub7 cells were treated with 10 μΜ of LM in DMSO or DMSO as a control for 24 hrs. The cells were transferred in a migration chamber coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences). After 16 hrs, invasive cells attached to the bottom of the membrane were stained/counted and normalized by the number of migrative cells in a corresponding non-coated migration chamber. FIG.2 also shows that LM treatment inhibited cell invasion in a poorly differentiated HCC cell line (Focus). [00316] In another set of experiments, the effects of LM and 3-(5-amino-2-methyl-4-oxo-4/7-quinazolin-3-yl)-pipcridinc-2,6-dionc (“Compound A”) on HCC cell migration were assessed using procedures similar to those described above, except that ΗΑΚ-1Α cell line (well differentiated HCC cell line) was employed. As shown in FIG. 3, it was found that LM and Compound A did not affect the cell migration in ΗΑΚ-1Α cell line. [00317] In another set of experiments, the effects of LM and Compound A on HCC cell migration and invasion were assessed using procedures similar to those described above, except that ΗΑΚ-1Β cell line (poorly differentiated HCC cell line) was employed. As shown in FIG. 4, it was found that LM and Compound A inhibited cell migration in poorly differentiated ΗΑΚ-1Β HCC cell line. In addition, it was found that Compound A (and LM to a much lower degree) inhibited cell invasion in poorly differentiated ΗΑΚ-1ΑΒ HCC cell line. [00318] In another set of experiments, the effects of LM and Compound A on HCC cell migration and invasion were assessed using procedures similar to those described above using FOCUS cell line (poorly differentiated HCC cell line). As shown in FIG. 5, it was found that LM and Compound A did not inhibit cell migration of poorly differentiated FOCUS HCC cells. However, it was found that LM and Compound A inhibited cell invasion of poorly differentiated FOCUS HCC cells. [00319] In another set of experiments, the effects of LM and Compound A on HCC cell migration were assessed using wound healing assay in ΗΑΚ-1Α cell line (well differentiated HCC cell line). The following procedures were used. 1. Cell seeding: A grid on the underside of the plate (60mm) was drawn according to the paper diagram. Cells were seeded on 60 mm dish (aimed for confluent cells). 2. Scratch wound: Using a tip (green), a scratch wound was made. The locations of the wounds were recorded by drawing on a paper. SF DMEM + trypsin aliquot was retrieved from the incubator, and the media/floating cells from the dish was aspirated. Cells were washed with DMEM + Trypsin to remove cells that have not been completely scratched away from the wound. Then the dish was filled with 4 ml of 10% FBS DMEM. 3. Taking photographs: The marker was included on the top of the image frame so the same wound area can be kept track of. Then pictures of those wounds for the indicated time points were taken. Results were expressed as percentage of wound closure, as an index of cell migration, normalized to the initial width. [00320] As shown in FIG. 6, it was found that LM and Compound A did not affect the cell migration in ΗΑΚ-1Α cell line. [00321] In another set of experiments, the effects of LM and Compound A on HCC cell migration were assessed using wound healing assay in FOCUS cell line (poorly differentiated HCC cell line). As shown in FIG. 7, it was found that LM and Compound A reduced cell migration in poorly differentiated FOCUS cell line. [00322] In another set of experiments, the effects of LM and Compound A on HCC cell migration were assessed using wound healing assay in ΗΑΚ-1Β cell line (poorly differentiated HCC cell line). As shown in FIG. 8, it was found that Compound A, but not LM, reduced cell migration in poorly differentiated ΗΑΚ-1Β cell line. 5.3 TCF transcriptional activity of TCF-4 isoforms [00323] Cells (ΗΕΚ 293 and Huh7) were co-transfected with the TCF-reporter plasmid TOPFlash and isoforms C, J, or L of TCF-4 and P-catcnin as a co-activator. An empty vector (EV) was used as a control for the basal level of TCF activity and a dominant negative form (dn) of TCF-4 for the assessment of repressed TCF transcriptional activity. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were lyzed and the expression of the reporter gene (luciferase) was quantified by chemoluminescence using the Fuciferase Assay System (Promega). Transcriptional activity of TCF-4 isoforms is showin in FIG. 9. 5.4 Expression profile of TCF-4 isoforms in human HCC tissues [00324] The relative mRNA levels of TCF-4C, J, and F in 20 pairs of HCC tumors and corresponding adjacent uninvolved liver tissue obtain from individuals where 85% (17/20) of the tumors were related to chronic HCV infection were measured. Comparisons were made to three histologically normal liver specimens by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Among the 20 paired samples, upregulation of all three iso forms, i.e., TCF-4C, J, and F, was found in 4 tumor tissues (FIG. 10). In FIG. 10, Ν, ρΤ, and Τ stand for normal liver specimens, peritumor tissues, and tumor tissues, respectively. [00325] In another set of experiments, the level of TCF-4J mRNA was measured by RT-PCR in 27 paired HBV-related HCC tumor and corresponding adjacent peritumor (FIG. 11 A) and in 20 paired paired HCV-related HCC tumor (FIG. 1 IB). Right panels on FIGs. 11A and 1 IB show average of the TCF-4J mRNA expression level. As shown in these figures, it was found that TCF-4J was significantly upregulated in tumor, especially in poorly differentiated tumor. 5.5 Effect of TCF-4J expression on the growth of xenografted tumors in nude mice [00326] HAK-lA-derived stable clones were used for xenograft experiments; parental ΗΑΚ-1Α cells do not form tumors in nude mice. TCF-4J-overexpressing ΗΑΚ-1Α stable clones (J cells) were highly tumorigenic. Although Κ cells generated small tumors, they appeared later (about 40 days) after tumor cell injection and grew very slowly. Control (EV) cells did not produce tumors. Cells (1χ106) were s.c. injected into 5-wk old male BALB/c nude mice (η = 12). The tumor size was measured in two orthogonal directions using electric calipers twice per week. When the longer diameter reached 10 mm, the mice were sacrificed. As showin in FIG. 12, TCF-4J iso form expression promoted tumorigenesis. 5.6 Upregulation of TCF-4J dependent target genes [00327] Total RNA (50 ng) extracted from HAK-1A-J or -Κ overexpressing stable cells by using Trizol was labeled with Agilent Fow-Input QuickAmp Fabeling Kit. Whole genome expression profiling was conducted in Whole Human Genome Microarray Kit, 4x44k, which included five glass slides each formatted with four highdefinition 44k arrays (Agilent Technologies). Data analysis was performed by using Feature Extraction software (Agilent) and the result is summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Gene Upregulation Gene Ratio (J/K) TCF-4J TCF-4K WISP2 9.4 1956 208 ASPH 2.4 1400 585 IRS1 3.4 286 84 ΜΑΡΚ12 2.9 120 41 JAG1 2.1 466 227 [00328] The list of TCF-4J isoform-dependent upregulated target genes in ΗΑΚ-1Α cell line is provided in FIG. 13. It was found that these genes are related to three pathways, i.e., Wnt/p-catenin, IRS-1, and Notch signaling, which are known to be important in HCC pathogenesis. [00329] Expression levels of target genes were measured by qRT-PCR in a 47 paired human HCC tumors (designated “T” in FIG. 14) and corresponding adjacent peritumor (designated “pT”) and three normal liver tissues (designated “N”). FIG. 14 illustrates the increased expression levels of TCF-4J specific target genes. [00330] A 3D bar chart indicating expression levels of 10 selected in the tumor samples, ordered according to the measured TCF-4J expression level, is provided in FIG. 15. The expression level of TCF-4J was evaluated by semi-quantative RT-PCR, and the values were normalized to GAPDH. qRT-PCR was used to evaluate expression levels of the selected genes, and the values were normalized to 18S rRNA. As shown in FIG. 15, tumors with high TCF-4J expression tended to have increased expression of more target genes. 5.7 Effect of lenalidomide on TCF-4 isoforms [00331] The HCC cell lines (Focus and Hub7) were treated with 10 μΜ of FM in DMSO or DMSO as a control for 24 hrs. Total RNA was extracted, reverse transcribed into cDNA and TCF-4 isoforms were amplified by PCR. The expression of TCF-4C, J, and F was analyzed by qualification of the PCR product on gel and normalized by the express of the housekeeping gene GAPDH using ImageJ. The results are shown in FIG. 16. 5.8 Cytotoxicity of 3-(5-amino-2-methyl-4-oxo-4//-quinazolin-3-yl)piperidine-2,6-dione [00332] MTS assay was performed to evaluate the toxicity of Compound A for HCC cell lines Huh7, FOCUS, ΗΑΚ-1Α and ΗΑΚ-1Β. Compound A, at various concentrations ranging from 1μΜ to 100μΜ, was incubated with the specified cells for 24 or 72 hours. As shown in FIG. 17, no effect on HCC cell proliferation was observed for Compound A. 5.9 HAK1A-J xenograft models - Pilot Study [00333] Effects of FM and Compound A in HAK1A-J xenograft models were examined in a pilot study using 5 animals (mice). A schematic illustration of study procedure is shown in FIG. 18. Anti-tumor effects of FM and Compound A were assessed following the xenograft by measuring tumor volume after the treatment by the drugs. As shown in FIG. 19, both LM and Compound A significantly reduced the volume of tumors as compared with control. 5.10 HAK1A-J xenograft models [00334] Effects of LM and Compound A in HAK1A-J xenograft models were examined using 50 male mice 4 weeks of age. A schematic illustration of study procedure is shown in FIG. 20. Anti-tumor effects of LM and Compound A were assessed following the xenograft by measuring tumor volume after the treatment by the drugs. As shown in FIG. 21, while reduction of tumor volume was observed in both LM and Compound A treated mice, Compund A much more significantly reduced the volume of tumors as compared with control or LM treated mice. [00335] Effects of LM and Compound A on expression of TCF-4J responsive target genes in ΗΑΚ-1Α xenograft tumors were assessed by measuring mRNA expression levels of TCF-4J iso form dependent target genes in xenograft tumors treated with LM, Compound A and control vehicle. The following procedures were used: Total RNA was extracted from tumors using TRIzol Reagent, and reverse transcription was performed with First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for RT-PCR (AMV). Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out on a Mastercycler ℮ρ realplex instrument and software, using SYBR Green PCR reagents. Relative quantification was performed using AACt method, normalizing to 18S rRNA. Dissociation curves were generated to evaluate PCR product specificity and purity. As shown in FIG. 22, it was found that mRNA levels of CLDN2, ASPH, JAG1, GPR56, ΑΝΧΑ1 and CAMK2N1 were reduced following the treatment by Compound A.
