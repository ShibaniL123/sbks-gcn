Step 6: Synthesis of 4-(4-(4-(3-(dimethylamino)prop-1-yn-1-yl)-3-fluorophenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)-N-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy)butanamide
To a solution of 4-(4-(4-(3-(dimethylamino)prop-1-yn-1-yl)-3-fluorophenyl)-3,6-dihydropyridin-1(2H)-yl)-2-methyl-2-(methylsulfonyl)butanoic acid (200 mg, 1 eq) in DMF (10 ml) was added with HATU (244 mg, 1.4 eq), HOBT (98 mg, 1.4 eq), Et3N (0.19 ml, 3 eq) and O-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride (141 mg, 2 eq). The mixture was stirred for 1 hr at room temperature and extracted with ethyl acetate and water. The organic layer was washed with brine, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified with column chromatography to prepare the title compound (166 mg, 68%).
