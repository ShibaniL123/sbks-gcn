Intermediate 1. Ethyl 4,6-dimethyl-1H-indole-2-carboxylate
p-Toluene sulfonic acid (PTSA, 11.023 g, 55 mmol) was added to 100 mL of benzene and refluxed under Dean-Stark conditions for 2 hours. Ethyl pyruvate (5.04 g, 43 mmol) and 4,6-dimethylphenylhydrazine hydrogen chloride (5.00 g, 23 mmol) were slowly added to the mixture with an additional 0.141 g PTSA and the reaction was refluxed overnight. After cooling to room temperature, the organic layer was neutralized with NaHCO3, extracted twice with EtAc and washed sequentially with 5 M NaHCO3, H2O and brine. Crude product was purified using flash column chromatography with a 0-30% EtAc in hexanes gradient 1.75 mg (27.7%) of tan powder;
