SPARRING DEVICE Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a sparring device. Background to the Invention Physical exercise, training and conditioning activities are increasing in popularity within modern society and athletic competition. These activities have seen a demand for equipment which pushes individual’s fitness further and gives the user a competitive advantage. When combative sports, such as boxing, are concerned, live opposition and sparring are essential to a person’s training programme. However live training opponents are not always available and this has led to the development of a range of fitness equipment such as punch bags, dummies, speed balls, moving targets and the like. Unfortunately, whilst these devices are good for general training, for example improving style, movement, and speed they do not address advanced requirements such as training out of bad habits, or punishment of mistakes. There has now been devised a sparring device which substantially overcomes or mitigates the above mentioned and/or other disadvantages associated with the prior art. Summary of the Invention In a first aspect of the invention there is provided a device for simulating realistic sparring comprising a punch bag supported by a base, the punch bag being freely rotatable about a vertical axis which runs through the base and the punch bag, the punch bag being displaceable away from said vertical axis but biased towards said vertical axis by a resiliently deformable portion of the bag. The device according to the invention is advantageous because when the bag is displaced away from the vertical axis, for example when it is punched, a resilient force brought about by the resiliently deformable portion causes the bag to be forcibly biased back towards the vertical axis. Thus the bag not only provides a punching target, but also a reactive target as well which the person delivering the punch must react to, to avoid being hit by the bag. The device according to the invention is further advantageous because the bag can be rotated through 360 degrees about the vertical axis. Therefore when a punch is delivered to a particular part of the bag, the bag can be caused to rotate, with other or opposing parts of the bag then being brought towards the user on his or her opposing side. Thus whilst punching from one side of the body the user must learn to defend on the other with the same force as the delivered punch. The device according to the invention is therefore particularly advantageous because it combines this resilient biasing with the reactive punching with the result that the device is able to simulate sparring far more realistically than existing prior art devices. The device according to the invention is particularly advantageous as it punishes mistakes and bad habits by the user. If one loses concentration, stamina timing or strength, then the device will take full advantage and deliver a corresponding blow to the user. The punch bag may comprise one or more protrusions configured to simulate punching arms of an opponent. The protrusions preferably extend away from the vertical axis of the bag. The protrusions may comprise resiliently deformable portions whereby if the portions are contacted by the user the protrusions deflect and are then biased back to a resting position. The protrusions may comprise deformable portions whereby deformation of the deformable portions causes the protrusion to bend from a first position to a second position. The protrusions may comprise a padded portion. The padded portion is preferably at a distal end of the protrusion farthest away from the bag. The padded portion can be in the shape of a glove or the like. The protrusions may be integral with the bag. Preferably the protrusions are connected to the bag by means of a connecting portion at the proximal end of the protrusion. The connecting portion may comprise a snap fit arrangement, a push fit arrangement, a male and female screw thread arrangement, a hook and loop fastener arrangement, zip fastener arrangement or button fit arrangement. The bag is freely rotatable about the vertical axis which runs through the base and the bag preferably by a support extending between the bag and the base. Preferably, one end of the support is rotatably connected to the base and the other end is fixedly connected to the bag. Alternatively, one end of the support may be rotatably connected to the bag and the other end is fixedly connected to the base. Alternatively, one end of the support is rotatably connected to the base and the other end is rotatably connected to the bag. The resiliently deformable portion of the bag may comprise a flexible member such as a flexible shaft, extension spring, elastic portion or the like. The resiliently deformable portion may be internal of the bag. The resiliently deformable portion of the bag may comprise all or part of said support. Examples of how the resiliently deformable portion of the bag may comprise all or part of said support include but are not limited to a shaft of sprung material such as spring steel connected at one end fixedly to the bag and the other rotatably to the base. In another example the bottom of the bag is connected to one end of an extension spring, wherein the other end of the extension spring is connected to a rigid shaft which is rotatably mounted within the base. The resiliently deformable portion may comprise a series of springs or the like extending from the inside of the bag to a central position at which said support engages with the springs. The punch bag may comprise an interior and exterior portion. The interior portion may be resiliently deformable. The interior portion may comprise foam or padding or other spongy like material. The exterior portion preferably covers the internal portion. The exterior portion preferably prevents loss of the material of the interior portion. The exterior portion preferably provides a surface to punch against. The exterior portion preferably comprises a plastics, canvass, fabric or leather material. The punch bag may comprise an adjustment member adapted to control the separation of the punch bag from the base. The adjustment member may be integral with the support. The adjustment member preferably controls the height of the punch bag in use. The punch bag may comprise block portions on the exterior of the bag. Preferably the block portions are arranged around a central hub of the bag. Each block portion preferably extends radially from the hub and consecutive block portions are preferably spaced equally apart around the hub. Each block portion preferably comprises a projection of the hub. Each block portion preferably comprises substantially the same material as the hub. The divisions between the block portions preferably define indents/recesses in the bag. The one or more protrusions configured to simulate punching arms of an opponent may be attached to each of the block portions. As preferred embodiment of the invention will now be described in greater detail, by way of illustration, with reference to the drawings. Brief Description of the Drawings Figure 1 shows a three dimensional perspective view of an embodiment of the device according to the invention. Figure 2 is a plan view from overhead an embodiment of the device according to the invention. Detailed Description of the Illustrated Embodiment In figure 1 there is shown an embodiment of the device according to the invention. The device is generally designated 1 in the drawing. The device comprises a punch bag 10 and a base 20. The device 1 has a support 30 which is connected rotatably to the base 20, but fixedly to the bag 10. Thus the bag 10 can rotate freely through 360 degrees about the vertical axis y-y which runs through the central part of the base 20 and the centre of the bag 10 (see circular arrows at the top of the figure). The bag 10 is supported by the base 20 in that the base 20 is weighted to prevent the bag 10 from toppling over. The base 20 is positioned on the ground in use. The base 20 may also be affixed to a raised platform or station or the like, so as to raise the device 1 from the ground or make it moveable. The bag 20 is a punch bag and is formed from a foam interior with an external plastic covering. Inside the foam there are a series of form members (not shown) which link together and connect to where the support 30 connects to the bag. The form members enable the bag to be supported from a central axis. The bag 20 comprises block portions 12 on the exterior of the bag. The bag in figure 1 has four block portions 12 (only three are shown). The four block portions 12 can be seen in Figure 2 more clearly. The block portions 12 are arranged around a central hub 14. Each block portion 12 extends radially from the hub 14 and consecutive block portions 12 are spaced equally apart around the hub 14. Each block portion 12 comprises a projection of the hub 14. In the examples shown, the block portions are projections which run the full length of the bag and extending outwards of the hub. Each block portion 12 comprises the same material as the hub 14. The divisions between the block portions 12 define indents/recesses in the bag. On the bag 10 there are provided protrusions 40 which are attached to each of the block portions 12. The protrusions 40 are generally in the shape of and represent an arm of an opponent. The protrusions 40 comprise a connecting portion 42, a flexible portion 44 and a glove portion 46. The connecting portion 42 is concertina plastics type material, which can be bent to a number of angles or extended inwards or outwards of the bag 10. The connecting portion 42 comprises a female screw thread fashioned into the end of the concertina plastics type material of the connecting portion 42 and a male cooperating thread mounted onto the block portion 12 of the bag 10. The protrusions 40 are thus affixed to the bag by screwing the proximal end of the flexible portion 44 to the bag 10. The glove portion 46 comprises a glove which is a conventional boxing glove. The glove is attached to the other end of the flexible portion 44 (at the distal end). The glove has some internal padding to simulate a real hand within a glove. The glove is covered in leather. The support 30 has an upper part 32 which is connected to the bag 10 fixedly, and a lower part 34 which is rotatably connected to the base 20. Between the upper and lower parts there is an extension spring 36 which allows deflection of the bag 10 in the X, Υ and Ζ planes (i.e in, and back, left and right, up and down) (see arrows on figure 1 and 2). The lower part 34 is received within an opening 22 in the base 20. The opening 22 extends into the interior of the base 20. The opening comprises two bearings, an upper bearing 24 and a lower bearing 25. The non-moveable outer parts of each bearing are fixed to the base 20 within the opening 22 using conventional clamp fittings which affix the outside of each bearing to a bracing member 28 in the opening. The upper bearing 24 is positioned at the entrance to the opening 22. The lower bearing 25 is positioned away from the upper bearing 24 approximately two thirds of the way into the base 20. Both bearings 24 and 25 are positioned on the axis y-y. The bearings 24 and 25 receive the lower part 34 of the support 30. A collar (not shown) is attached to the support 30 around the lower part 34 above the upper bearing 24. This controls the amount of the lower part 34 received within the opening 22 and prevents the lower part 34 from touching the floor or the base 20. The collar has a grub screw which extends through the collar so as to contact and fix the collar with the lower part 34. By loosening, the grub screw, sliding the collar along the lower part 34 and then tightening the grub screw, the height of the bag from the floor can be adjusted. Figure 2 shows an embodiment of the device according to the invention from above. The bag 10 is shown with the four protrusions 40 extending radially from the centre of the bag 10. Two of the protrusions 40a and 40b have been bent at right angles to the radial extension line. Two boxers A and Β are using the device 1. The protrusions 40b and 40a are bent so as to simulate an opponent attacking from an alternative direction. Protrusion 40c has been compressed to simulate a closer opponent. In use, the user punches the bag 10 or the protrusions 40 or both. In so doing the bag 10 may deflect in the X, Υ or Ζ planes. The bag may be used by a plurality of users at any one time. When a user punches the device, this forces the bag to rotate and deflect along with the protrusions, forcing the A and Β to react. Given the number of possible rotation and deflection options provided for by the invention the punch bag responds to being punched by a user in a manner which is more realistic than any device disclosed in the prior art. 1.
