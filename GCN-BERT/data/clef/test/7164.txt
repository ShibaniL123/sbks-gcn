Intermediate 11: 2-Isopropyl-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine
To a solution of 5-(trifluoromethyl)-3a,7a-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine (Intermediate 8, 345 mg, 1.84 mmol) in dry DMF (8.7 mL) were added 2-iodopropane (550 Î¼L, 5.51 mmol) and Cs2CO3 (1.2 g, 3.7 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 54 h. The mixture was diluted with toluene (15 mL), filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (SiO2; 5% EtOAc/toluene) to give the title compound (160 mg, 37% yield) as a pale yellow crystalline solid.
