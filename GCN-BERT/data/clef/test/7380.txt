AUTOMATED RADIOSYNTHESIS Technical Field of the Invention The present invention relates to in vivo imaging and in particular to in vivo imaging of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors of the central nervous system (CNS). The invention provides a method suitable for the automated synthesis of radiofluorinated GABA receptor antagonist compounds. Description of Related Art Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human brain. GABA receptors are transmembrane receptors and fall into two main types, GABAa receptors and GABAb receptors. GABAa receptors have been the major focus of pharmacological development to date. Many GABAa receptor subtypes have been discovered and novel chemical structures have been developed which are selective for these subtypes. Normal activation of the GABAa receptor results in chloride ion being selectively conducted through its pore. This chloride channel gating is generally inhibitory on a neuron by virtue of stabilising the membrane potential near to resting level. Defective GABAa receptor neurotransmission may be caused by a reduction in GABAa receptors, or by defective functioning of the GABAa receptor due to e.g. a genetic mutation in a GABAa receptor gene, traumatic brain injury, or a pharmacological insult, and is implicated in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, anxiety disorders, Parkinson’s disease and chronic pain. The development of radioligands selective for the GABAa receptor is therefore of value in terms of brain imaging studies in living human patients, in particular those suffering from disorders associated with defective GABAa receptor neurotransmission. Flumazenil (also known as flumazepil, code name Ro 15-1788, trade names Anexate, Lanexat, Mazicon, Romazicon) is an imidazo[1,5- a][ 1,4]benzodiazepine that is a neutralising allosteric modulator of GABAa receptors in the CNS (Johnston 1996 Pharmacol Ther; 69(3): 173-198). The most common use of flumazenil to date has been as an antidote to benzodiazepine overdose as it reverses the effects of benzodiazepines by competitive inhibition at the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABAa receptor. In addition, because flumazenil has little or no agonist activity, radiolabelled versions thereof have been developed as positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers. [18F]FMZ has the same chemical formula as flumazenil but wherein 18F is incorporated by direct radiofluorination of a nitro precursor: [18F]FMZ binds to the GABAa receptor with high affinity (Ki around 0.5ηΜ) and selectivity. Ryzhikov et al (2005 Nuc Med Biol; 32: 109-116) describe the preparation of [18F]FMZ from a nitro precursor compound. This synthesis, however, has been found by the present inventors to have a less than optimal end of synthesis (EOS) yield of 2.7-7.7% (described herein as a comparative example). These EOS yields are comparable to those reported by Odano et al (Neuroimage 2009; 45(3): 891-902). The present invention seeks means to obtain radiofluorinated agents that bind to the GABAa receptor with high affinity in improved yields compared to the prior art methods. Summary of the Invention The present invention provides a method to obtain radiofluorinated compounds useful for in vivo imaging GABAa receptors. The method of the invention is C:\NRPonb)\DCC£XDV4} 16751_ I DOC-11Λΐ3/2012 high-yielding in comparison to the prior art methods. A further aspect of the invention is a cassette suitable for carrying out the automated method of synthesis of the invention. Novel precursor compounds useful in the method of the invention are also provided, as are certain novel radiofluorinated compounds obtained by the method of the invention. Detailed Description of the Invention In one aspect, the present invention provides a method to obtain a compound of Formula I: R1 is hydrogen and R2 is 18F; and R3 is a C3-5 heterocycle; or, R3 is C(=0)-0-R4 wherein R4 is hydrogen, or a straight- or branched-chain C1.4 alkyl; wherein said method comprises: (i) providing a precursor compound of Formula la: C:\NRPortbl\DCC\SXD\431675M.DOC* 11Λ·5/20)2 wherein: R11 is hydrogen and R12 is a leaving group selected from nitro, tri-Ci.3 alkyl ammonium or-l+-Ar, wherein Ar is phenyl substituted with one or more R’ groups, wherein R’ is selected from hydrogen, nitro, cyano, halogen, Cm0 hydroxyalkyl, C2-10 carboxyalkyl, Cm0 alkyl, C2-10 alkoxyalkyl, Cmo hydroxyalkyl, Cmo aminoalkyl, Cmo haloalkyl, Ce-14 aryl, C3.12 heteroaryl, C3.20 alkylaryl, C2-10 alkenyl, and C2.ioalkynyl; and, R13 is as defined for R3 of Formula I; and, (ii) reacting said precursor compound with a suitable source of [18F]Fluoride. A "precursor compound" comprises a non-radioactive derivative of a radiolabeled compound, designed so that chemical reaction with a convenient chemical form of the detectable label occurs site-specifically; can be conducted in the minimum number of steps (ideally a single step); and without the need for significant purification (ideally no further purification), to give the desired in vivo imaging agent. Such precursor compounds are synthetic and can conveniently be obtained in good chemical purity. The precursor compound may optionally comprise a protecting group for certain functional groups of the precursor compound. A "leaving group" is a substituent of the precursor compound as defined above which is replaced with 18F when the precursor compound is reacted with a suitable source of [18F]fluoride, thereby permitting incorporation of 18F site-specifically to result in the desired radiofluorinated compound of Formula I. By the term "protecting group" is meant a group which inhibits or suppresses undesirable chemical reactions, but which is designed to be sufficiently reactive that it may be cleaved from the functional group in question under mild enough conditions that do not modify the rest of the molecule. After deprotection the desired product is obtained. Protecting groups are well known to those skilled in the art and are suitably chosen from, for amine groups: Boc (where Boc is terf-butyloxycarbonyl), Fmoc (where Fmoc is fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl), trifluoroacetyl, allyloxycarbonyl, Dde [i.e. 1-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexylidene)ethyl] or Npys (i.e. 3-nitro-2-pyridine sulfenyl); and for carboxyl groups: methyl ester, tert-butyl ester or benzyl ester. For hydroxyl groups, suitable protecting groups are: methyl, ethyl or fe/t-butyl; alkoxymethyl or alkoxyethyl; benzyl; acetyl; benzoyl; trityl (Trt) or trialkylsilyl such as tetrabutyldimethylsilyl. The use of further protecting groups are described in ‘Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis’, Theorodora W. Greene and Peter G. Μ. Wuts, (Third Edition, John Wiley & Sons, 1999). The term “alkyl” used either alone or as part of another group is defined herein as any straight, branched or cyclic, saturated or unsaturated CnFl2n+i group. The term “aryl” used either alone or as part of another group is defined herein as any C6-14 molecular fragment or group which is derived from a monocyclic or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, or a monocyclic or polycyclic heteroaromatic hydrocarbon. The term “halogen” means a group selected from fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. The term “nitro” refers to the group -N02. The term “cvano” refers to the group -CN.

The term “alkynyl” means a straight-chain or branched chain hydrocarbon radical having one or more triple bonds. In a preferred embodiment of the method of the invention where R1 is 18F, R11 is trimethyl ammonium or -l+-Ar. In a most preferred embodiment of the method of the invention R2 is 18F. When R2 is 18F, it is preferred that R12 is nitro, trimethyl ammonium or -l+-Ar. When R2 is 18F, it is most preferred that R12 is nitro. R3 of Formula I and R13 of Formula la are the same and are preferably C(=0)-0-R4, wherein R4 is straight or branched-chain Ci_4 alkyl, preferably methyl, ethyl, isopropyl or tert-butyl. R4 is most preferably ethyl, isopropyl or tert-butyl, and especially preferably ethyl. The reaction scheme disclosed by Yang et a/(2009 Synthesis; 6: 1036-1040) can be adapted to obtain precursor compounds of Formula la wherein R11 is a leaving group. Scheme 1 illustrates how the precursor compounds can be obtained: In Scheme 1, where R11 is trialkylammonium, R21 is N02, and where R11 is an iodonium salt, R21 is bromine. R13 is as defined for Formula la. The appropriate amino benzoic acid compound a, equipped to perform the required chemistry to introduce the desired leaving group at later stage, is reacted with triphosgene to afford the benzoxazine-2,4-dione intermediate b. Reaction of b with sarcosine in DMSO yields the benzodiazepine c. At this stage, where R11 is trialkylammonium, R21 of compound c is converted to trialkylammonium in step (i) before carrying out step (ii)to obtain compound d. Where R11 is an iodonoim salt, R21 is converted to the iodonium salt in step (iii) after carrying out step (ii). Where R12 is the leaving group, Scheme 2 may be used to obtain the precursor compound: R22 is as defined for R21 in Scheme 1 above. Compound ℮ is obtained from commercially-available 2,6-dinitro benzoic acid starting material by standard chemical transformations. Compound ℮ is treated as described for compound a of Scheme 1 to give the benzodiazepine intermediate g, which in turn is transformed in the desired imidazobenzodiazepine either before (i.e. (ii) and then (iii)) or after (i.e. (i) and then (ϋ)) introducing the desired leaving group. Steps (i)-(iii) are as described above in relation to Scheme 1. [18F]Fluoride is typically obtained as an aqueous solution which is a product of the irradiation of an [180]-water target. It has been widespread practice to carry out various steps in order to convert [18F]Fluoride into a reactive nucleophilic reagent, such that it is suitable for use in nucleophilic radiolabelling reactions. These steps include the elimination of water from [18F]-fluoride ion and the provision of a suitable counterion (Handbook of Radiopharmaceuticals 2003 Welch & Redvanly eds. ch. 6 ρρ 195-227). Nucleophilic radiofluorination reactions are then carried out using anhydrous solvents (Aigbirhio et al 1995 J Fluor Chem; 70: 279-87). In order to increase the reactivity of fluoride and to avoid hydroxylated by-products resulting from the presence of water, water is typically removed from [18F]Fluoride prior to the reaction and the radiofluorination reactions are carried out using anhydrous reaction solvents (Aigbirhio et al 1995 J Fluor Chem; 70:279-87). The removal of water from the [18F]Fluoride is referred to as making “naked” [18F]Fluoride. This is regarded in the prior art relating to nucleophilic fluoridation as a step necessary to increase the reactivity of fluoride as well as to avoid hydroxylated by-products resulting from the presence of water (Moughamir etal 1998 Tett Letts; 39: 7305-6). A further step that is used to improve the reactivity of [18F]Fluoride for radiofluoridation reactions is to add a cationic counterion prior to the removal of water. The counterion should possess sufficient solubility within the anhydrous reaction solvent to maintain the solubility of the fluoride ion. Counterions that have been used include large but soft metal ions such as rubidium or caesium, potassium complexed with a cryptand such as Kryptofix™, ortetraalkylammonium salts. A preferred suitable source of [18F]Fluoride for use in the method of the invention is selected from [18F] potassium fluoride and [18F] caesium fluoride. [18F] potassium fluoride is most preferred, and especially preferably when it is complexed with a cryptand such as Kryptofix™ because of its good solubility in anhydrous solvents and enhanced fluoride reactivity. In a preferred embodiment, the method of the invention may further comprise: (iii)removal of excess [18F]Fluoride; and/or, (iv)removal of any protecting groups; and/or, (ν) removal of organic solvent; and/or, (vi)formulation of the resultant compound together with a biocompatible carrier to obtain a radiopharmaceutical composition suitable for mammalian administration. The “biocompatible carrier” is a fluid, especially a liquid, in which the radiofluorinated compound is suspended or dissolved, such that the radiopharmaceutical composition is physiologically tolerable, i.e. can be administered to the mammalian body without toxicity or undue discomfort. The biocompatible carrier is suitably an injectable carrier liquid such as sterile, pyrogen-free water for injection; an aqueous solution such as saline (which may advantageously be balanced so that the final product for injection is either isotonic or not hypotonic); an aqueous solution of one or more tonicity-adjusting substances (e.g. salts of plasma cations with biocompatible counterions), sugars (e.g. glucose or sucrose), sugar alcohols (e.g. sorbitol or mannitol), glycols (e.g. glycerol), or other non-ionic polyol materials (e.g. polyethyleneglycols, propylene glycols and the like). The biocompatible carrier may also comprise biocompatible organic solvents such as ethanol. Such organic solvents are useful to solubilise more lipophilic compounds or formulations. Preferably the biocompatible carrier is pyrogen-free water for injection, isotonic saline or an aqueous ethanol solution. The pH of the biocompatible carrier for intravenous injection is suitably in the range 4.0 to 10.5. Currently, the synthesis of 18F-labelled compounds, particularly for use as PET tracers, is most conveniently carried out by means of an automated synthesis apparatus, e.g. Tracerlab™ and Fastlab™ (both GE Healthcare). However, the prior art method is not suitable for automation. In Comparative Example 1 herein it is demonstrated that radioflurination of nitromazenil is not an ideal approach for the automated synthesis of [18F]FMZ on Fastlab due to the low yield, and also because of the temperature required to obtain effective incorporation of [18F]fluoride. The existing FASTlab reaction vessel is made of a cyclo-olefin co-polymer (COC) which can be used at temperatures up to 130°C. The prior art method used to prepare [18F]FMZ from a nitro precursor requires a temperatures of around 160°C. At these temperatures the COC reaction vessel loses containment. As demonstrated in the experimental examples below, changing the leaving group on the nitromazenil precursor from nitro to trimethylammonium allowed the reaction temperature to be reduced to 130°C whilst maintaining an EOS yield of 7%. Moving the nitro leaving group from the position meta to the amide carbonyl to the position ortho to the amide carbonyl gave an improvement in EOS yield from 2.7-7.7% to 18-23% whilst also reducing the reaction temperature. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the method of the invention is automated. The radiochemistry is performed on the automated synthesis apparatus by fitting a “cassette” to the apparatus. Such a cassette normally includes fluid pathways, a reaction vessel, and ports for receiving reagent vials as well as any solid-phase extraction cartridges used in post-radiosynthetic clean up steps. In a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a cassette for carrying out the automated method of the invention comprising: (i) a vessel containing a precursor compound, wherein said precursor compound is as suitably and preferably defined above; and (ii) means for eluting the vessel with a suitable source of [18F]Fluoride, wherein said suitable source of [18F]Fluoride is as suitably and preferably defined above. The cassette may also comprise an ion-exchange cartridge for removal of excess 18F. The reagents, solvents and other consumables required for the automated synthesis may also be included together with a data medium, such as a compact disc carrying software, which allows the automated synthesiser to be operated in a way to meet the end user’s requirements for concentration, volumes, time of delivery etc. In another aspect, the present invention provides a compound of Formula I as defined in the method of the invention wherein R1 is hydrogen, R2 is [18F], and R4 is ethyl, isopropyl or f-butyl, wherein R4 is most preferably ethyl. In a yet further aspect, the present invention provides a precursor compound of Formula la is as defined above wherein one of R11 and R12 is trimethylammonium or -l+-Ar, and the other is hydrogen. Preferably, one of R11 and R12 is trimethylammonium and the other is hydrogen. Most preferably, R12 is nitro, trimethylammonium or -l+-Ar, most especially preferably R12 is nitro. R13 is preferably C(=0)-0-R4 wherein R4 is ethyl, isopropyl or tert-butyl, and wherein R4 is preferably ethyl.

Sarcosine (17.1 g, 0.192 mol) was slowly added in portions to the solution. Upon addition, at 140°C, the solution started bubbling (generation of C02). The mixture was left stirring for 2.5 h. The mixture was left to cool and slowly poured on ice cold water in a beaker. The solution was stirred with a glass rod and a yellow solid precipitated out. The solid was separated by filtration and washed several time with water, then dried in vacuum oven at 40°C overnight. The yellow solid isolated was identified as the desired product 1 in a 78% yield. 1H NMR (De-DMSO): δ 3.14 (3Η, s, NCH3), 3.97 (2Η, s, NCH2CO), 7.30 (1Η, d, J = 9 Hz, HNCCHCH), 8.33 (1 Η, dd,J= 9 and 3 Hz, CHCHCN02CH), 8.33 (1 Η, d,J= 3 Hz, OC-CCH), 11.05 (1 Η, s, ΝΗ).

The reaction mixture was poured into ice/water. This was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was washed with water, brine, dried and concentrated to a thick dark dense oil. This was chromatographed on several times using the following conditions: 1) Companion, using DCMI/ethyl acetate (twice) 2) Companion using petrol/ethyl acetate (twice) 50 mg of the pure material 2 was obtained as a colourless solid (yield 4%) 1H NMR (CDCIs): δ 1.39 (3Η, t,J=7 Hz, CH3), 3.28 (3Η, s, ArCONCH3), 4.37 (2Η, q, J= 7 Hz, OCH2), 4.40 (1Η, brs, CH2), 5.26 (1Η, brs, CH2), 7.60 (1Η, d, J= 8.9 Hz, ArCHCHCN02), 7.94 (1Η, s, NCHN), 8.45 (1Η, dd, J= 8.9 and 2.8 Hz, ArCHCHCN02), 8.95 (1Η, d, J= 2.5 Hz, ArCHCN02). Example 1(iii): Radiofluorination of Nitromazenil (2) to Obtain [18F1 flumazenil 18F labeling was done on a TRACERlab automated synthesis module (GE Healthcare). [18F] fluoride was trapped on a pre-conditioned QMA cartridge and then transferred to the reaction vessel using a solution of tetra-n-butylammonium bicarbonate in MeCN/water (MeCN 1400 μΐ-, water 100 μΐ-, TBA.HC03 27 mg) from vial 1. The solution was dried at 100°C for 10 minutes then 120°C for 20 minutes using nitrogen plus vacuum flow and then cooled to 50°C. To the dried [18F]fluoride was added nitromazenil (18.8 mg) in DMF (1 ml_) from vial 3. The reaction mixture was heated at 160°C for 30 min then it was cooled to 50°C. The reaction mixture was diluted with 10η∩Μ phosphoric acid (2.5 ml_)from vial 5 and was transferred to the crude product tube. The crude product was then transferred onto the preparative HPLC loop manually. Preparative HPLC gave a peak with retention time 17.5 minutes which was cut using into the TRACERlab round bottomed flask containing water (12 mL).

The suspension was treated with nitrogen followed by vacuum, before adding Pd/C 10% (0.7 g), suspended in ethanol. The reaction vessel was then fitted onto the Parr hydrogenator and left under hydrogen pressure (20 psi) for about 3 hours with stirring. The excess hydrogen gas was removed using vacuum and then nitrogen was purged through the solution. The catalyst was filtered off using celite and the filtrate was evaporated to the minimum amount of ethanol.

The reaction mixture was stirred at 0°C for 2 h and then at room temperature for 1 h. Acetic acid (1.4 ml_) was then added and the reaction mixture was stirred for another 2 h. The reaction mixture was poured into ethyl ether, washed with 2Ν ΚΟΗ and the basic layer was extracted several times with ethyl acetate. The organic phases were collected and dried and solvents removed in vacuum to give an amorphous yellowish solid.

After 40 min the reaction was cooled to 0°C and treated dropwise with diethyl chlorophosphate (1.08 ml_, 7.5 mmol) and stirred for 30 min. Meanwhile to a stirred solution of ethyl isocyanoacetate (0.656 ml_, 6 mmol) in DMF (6 ml_) under nitrogen at 0°C was added sodium hydride (280 mg of a 60% dispersion in mineral oil, 7 mmol) and stirred for 15 O min. This was then added slowly to the mixture of intermediate 5 at 0°C. This was stirred at 0°C for 0.5 h then room temperature for 30 mins. LCMS analysis of the crude after this time showed presence of desired mass. The reaction was quenched with acetic acid and worked up. The reaction mixture was poured into ice/water. This was extracted with ethyl acetate, followed by DCM. LCMS analysis of the organics and the water suggested desired material present in the water layer. This was therefore taken to dryness (using rotary evaporation) and then the crude analysed by semiprep HPLC. The desired product 6 was isolated in 25% yield.
