Method for preparation multifunctional liquid medicament from vegetable feedstock, and the product produced by the method The subject of the invention is a method for preparation multifunctional liquid medicament from vegetable feedstock, and the product produced by the method. The invention relates to a method of preparation of a medicine, in particular, to the manufacture of the liquid medicaments from vegetable feedstock. The method of efficient preparation of the product namely "phyto balsam" is proposed. The invention relates furthermore to the product produced by the method for preparation multifunctional liquid medicament from vegetable feedstock, which is a multifunctional phyto-complex balsam, namely «Balsam Living Vessels - 3850» as a medicine, applicable in particular for phytotherapy, and bears on the organism cure and health improvement. According to the prior art the use in medicine of repertories of medicinal plants and herbs is known. Some of them are inherently poisonous and of high toxicity. Their small dose administration has a curative effect and is used in the phyto- and homeopathy. The patents No RU 2044547 Int. Pat Class A61K 35/78, RU 2027441 Int. Pat Class A61K 35/78, RU 2310456 Int. Pat Class A61K33/00, RU 2171284 Int. Pat Class A61 K35/90, RU 2220736 Int. Pat Class A61K35/78 present such preparations based upon repertories of medicinal plants. The target plant repertories are currently in use that can clean the blood vessels, have antitumor activity, cure other diseases, and have a general tonic effect on the organism,, e.g., the Ralchenko balsam. The patent No RU 2171284 Int. Pat Class A61K35/78. The disadvantage of the Ralchenko invention is that its formula includes the oily extracts of herbs. This prevents from the efficient delivery of the medicinal components via the blood circulation system and does not let them pass through the cell membrane. Besides, the use of the oily extracts of herbs (91-95% of the preparation volume) may result in a sick feeling in human. The Ralchenko balsam includes 10 potent herbs, of which 4 are poisonous (celandine, hemlock, spurge, and henbane); hence, a higher risk of poisoning at accidental overdosage. The "Composition of Ingredients for Preparation of Medical and Preventive Balsam", patent No RU 2171284 Int. Pat Class A61K35/78, is considered the closest to the claimed multifunctional phyto-complex «Balsam Living Vessels - 3850» accepted as prior art. This preparation is aimed to improve the organism's host defenses; prevent and treat the gastrointestinal diseases, bronchial and pulmonary troubles, allergic states; and manage the immunoprotection. Prior art disadvantages: sophisticated preparation of balsam and great number of ingredients, herbs in repertory. The method of preparation of the "Composition of Ingredients for Preparation of Medical and Preventive Balsam" consists in infusing the feedstock, chopped in extractor, and immersed in boiling water. Then the 3-4 hour extraction is performed. Then the extract is filtered and the remaining feedstock is pressed out. The medicinal bitumen is dissolved in a separate recipient by adding warm extract and dissolving to the required concentration. The chopped propolis is dissolved in 96% alcohol, 100- 120 g/1 of solution, in a separate recipient. Then, the dissolved medicinal bitumen, bee glue, and alcohol, up to 24-30% of total balsam volume are added to the medicinal herbs extract. The medicinal herbs extracts are impossible to adequately extract by a 3-4 hour maceration in hot water. The efficiency of such herbal composition will be very low. When treating grave diseases with the water-based balsam, it is impossible to multifold increase the dose to gain the curative effect. The causes preventing from the expected result are the multi-component, 37-ingredient composition greatly affecting the production cost; and absence of expressed curative qualities. The currently in use methods of production of the balsams differ with each other not only as of the quantitative and qualitative compositions of the components, but as of the parameters of the process of the balsam teas and infusions preparation from solid feedstock, as well. For example, to prepare the "Yarilo" balsam patent No RU 94032688 Int. Pat Class C 12 G 3/06, 1996, the plants radices are chopped, immersed in water, and boiled during 30-40 minutes; the chopped herbs are added to the hot mix, at stirring; then the mix is left to cure during 10-12 ours. The natural honey and water- alcohol liquid are then added to the mix; the mix is left to settle during 24 hours; the resulting balsam is filtered. The disadvantage of this method is the low yield of the balsam, when a significant share of the biologically active substances and natural honey remains adsorbed on the solid phase. The currently in use method of production of the "Kupavna" balsam is described in the patent N° RU 02117697 Int. Pat Class C 12 G 3/06. According to this method, the calculated mass of the vegetable feedstock is immersed in the water-alcohol liquid, 70% vol. proof (ratio 1:10), left to cure during 10 day; the liquid phase is then discharged (the yield is 78% of the filled in liquid volume). Then, to obtain the second portion of the balsam infusion, the 50% proof water-alcohol liquid is added, the mix is left to cure 10 day, liquid is then discharged. The color is prepared applying the method currently in use, and diluted with water to 1,35 kg/1. The blackcurrant infusion is prepared by infusing 100 kg of the fresh blackcurrant fruits, the first preparation uses the water-alcohol liquid, 45% vol. proof, ratio 1:1, and the second preparation uses the water-alcohol liquid, 30% proof, ratio 1:0.7. Every preparation is cured 10 day. The total yield of the infusion from the mix of the preparations I and II is at 20% proof. Then the blackcurrant infusion of the preparations I and II, color, and balsam infusion, first and second preparations, are put into a blending vessel with blending paddle. The water-alcohol liquid is added to the blend to obtain the required volume of the 40% proof final balsam. The causes preventing from obtaining the desirable result are the duration of the process and insufficient yield of the balm. The method of production of the "Vigor" phyto-balsam, patent J s RU 2196595 C2 Int. Pat. Class A61K35/78 has been taken as prior art. With this method of the phyto-balsam preparation, the components are weighted; the vegetable feedstock is chopped and loaded into the extractor with a mesh lined with a filtering material on the bottom; then the water-alcohol liquid is added; the charge is left to cure 1-3 hours; the resulting extract is collected via the extractor's lower discharge and returned into the extractor via the upper tap of the extractor lid during 20-40 minutes; the infusion and circulation operations are repeated 1-3 times; the 65.8% sugar liquor is prepared; the balsam infusion, color, and sugar liquor are blended; the purified water and 96.2% ethylene alcohol are added; the charge is left to cure during 7 days, and filtered. The disadvantages of this method are the sophisticated method of preparation; the low extraction ratio of the medicinal herbs that cannot pass into the alcohol solution during the short, one to three hours, time; and the extraction, 1 to 3-fold repeated with the extract circulation. The medicinal herbs extraction ratio remains low and uncontrolled; hence, the negative effect at the medicinal balsams preparation. The medicinal qualities of this balsam are spoiled by the additions of the sugar and water, whose method of purification is not specified. In the "Vigor" phyto-balsam, at mixing the medicinal ingredients, the compliance of their concentrations in the extract with the balsam formulation cannot be accurately determined. And such accuracy is critical when using poisonous medicinal ingredients. When treating grave diseases with the "Vigor" phyto-balsam, it is impossible to multifold increase the dose to gain the curative effect. Recently, the balsams and tinctures made of the vegetable feedstock with curative and preventive qualities have become quite popular. The purpose of the present invention consists in creating a multifunctional medicinal complex product with health improving and curing effect. The purpose of the invention is furthermore to improve the curative and preventive qualities of the prepared product "phyto balsam", with the possibility to obtain the high enough accuracy of dosage, control the concentration of the medicinal ingredients, and eliminate the negative side effects. The purpose is achieved by that, the proposed method of manufacture of the product "phyto balsam" according to the invention includes weighting the vegetable feedstock of the medicinal ingredients of the used herbs and plants, and loading into the extractor adding the structured alcohol. The distinction from the prior art is that the invention uses the high quality 60-65% proof grape alcohol structured in a max. 40+j-10 milliTesla magnetic induction magnetic field by making the alcohol solution pass through a magnetic funnel containing a system of permanent magnets. The ingredients of the medicinal herbs prepared in form of the 23-25% humidity and 1.25-1.45 kg/dm3 specific weight thick concentrates obtained by evaporating in vacuum units of the aqueous and alcoholic extracts of the ingredients, with the 62-65% extraction ratio, and obligatory elimination from the medicinal herbs exudates of the ballast, compounds in form of albumins, sugar, enzymes, pectin, slime, starch, and other components, wherein the concentrated extracts contain no auxiliary preparations, fillers, preservatives, binders, and/or other auxiliary substances; and the so obtained extracts are preserved until the moment of preparation of the product "phyto balsam" according to the invention in the structured alcohol and then added into the extractor in the weight fractions according to the formula of product "phyto balsam" according to the invention, taking into account the share of the alcohol used for preservation. When working out the solution according the invention, we realized, that the said purpose is achieved by that to obtain the special qualities of the product «Balsam Living Vessels - 3850» phyto-complex the high quality, 60-65% proof, grape alcohol is used, without further dilution in water, which alcohol has the special properties of medium for medicinal herbs extracts, which extracts are prepared on the basis of the same special alcohol, and include the Caucasian Dioscorea (Dioscorea caucasica), Black Walnut (Juglans nigra), Ginkgo Biloba (Ginkgo biloba), Fir, Fir Needle Oil (Abies), Garlic (Allium sativum), Absinthium (Artemisia absinthium), Parsley (Petroselinum), Peach Leaves (Prunus persica), Thuja occidentalis (Thuja occidentalis), Cherry Laurel (Prunus laurocerasus), Black Elder (Sambucus nigra), Burdock (Arctium lappa), Filbert (Corylus avellana) at the following concentrations of the components of dry herbs in extracts, kg/lOOOml: - Caucasian Dioscorea (Dioscorea caucasica) - 0.1 - 0.57; - Black Walnut (Juglans nigra) - 0.1 - 0.76; - Ginkgo Biloba (Ginkgo biloba) - 0.1 - 0.79; - Fir, Fir Needle Oil (Abies) - 0.005 - 0.017; - Garlic (Allium sativum) - 0.005 - 0.019; - Absinthium (Artemisia absinthium) - 0.006 - 0.018; - Parsley (Petroselinum) - 0.045 - 0.150; - Peach Leaves (Priinus persica) - 0.012 - 0.08; - Thuja occidentalis (Thuja occidentalis) - 0.005 - 0.02; - Cherry Laurel (Prunus laurocerasus) - 0.01 - 0.03; - Black Elder (Sambucus nigra)- 0.005 - 0.02; - Burdock (Arctium lappa) - 0.008 - 0.025; - Filbert (Corylus avellana) - 0.007 - 0.02; - special grape alcohol. According to the today's views on diseases, the composition must include the plants acting upon the microorganisms that cause these or that disease, upon the pathogenetic mechanisms (inflammation, local and general disorders of hemostasia), upon the sanogenesis, upon the organism's regulatory mechanisms and its physiological functions. To achieve the purpose in view, the studies were necessary, consisting in selection of such set of ingredients for the «Balsam Living Vessels - 3850» that does not suppress or destroy the curative factors, but, vice versa, improves the physiologic properties of the other ingredients. The theoretical and practical development of the proposed «Balsam Living Vessels - 3850» composition has taken into account that the most potent plants are the poisonous ones. The phyto-complex composition, its concentration, and mode of administration have been selected so that to exclude the undesirable effects, including poisoning, on the human. The experimental observations by the authors of this invention have validated the viability of using the plant origin drugs in the combined therapy of different diseases, including oncologic, and excretion of radionuclides. The required formulation of the product "phyto balsam" according to the invention is very easy to compose of the said syrup, with the accuracy impossible with the currently in use methods of preparation of the phyto-balsams. For this purpose, the syrups of the ingredients are weighted and loaded into the extractor in accordance with the ingredients composition and concentration stated in the product "phyto balsam" according to the invention formulation. Then the structured alcohol measured with the measuring jug in accordance with the product "phyto balsam" according to the invention formulation is added into the extractor; the resulting blend is thoroughly mixed until the syrups of the ingredients are completely dissolved in the alcohol. The other distinction from the prior art and currently in use methods of preparation of the phyto-balsams is that the invention uses the high quality 60-65% proof grape alcohol structured in a max. 40+|-10 milliTesla magnetic induction magnetic field by making the alcohol solution pass through a magnetic funnel containing a system of permanent magnets. Not any magnet is capable to yield the highest effect in the liquids magnetization. The alcoholic solution magnetization trials have shown that the maximal efficiency is obtained when using a magnetic funnel with the built in magnetic system ensuring the max. 40+1-10 milliTesla magnetic induction. After the final dissolution of the syrups in alcohol, the resulting mix is left to cure during 3 days; then it is filtered and fed to the filling. The magnetic field is a special kind of matter, by which the interaction between the moving charged particles or bodies having magnetic moment is realized. The main characteristic of a magnetic field is the magnetic field strength determined by the magnetic induction vector B (magnetic field induction vector). In the SI system the magnetic induction is measured in tesla (T). It has been proven that a liquid having passed via a magnetic funnel has miraculous qualities: it has a beneficial effect on the status of the organism and its individual organs; it improves the penetrability of the tissue cells' biological membranes; it lowers the cholesterol in blood and liver; it favors the destruction of the stones in the kidneys, gall bladder, and urinary bladder. When an alcohol solution passes via a magnetic funnel with an integrated system of permanent magnets, the liquid molecules form a crystalline lattice similar to that of the melt water. The alcohol solutions having passed via a magnetic funnel obtain a finer and more uniform structure, significantly increasing their biologic activity, ecological cleanness, fluidity, and dissolving power. A magnetized alcohol solution becomes biologically active and favorable for human. It easily and freely penetrates into the intercellular fluids of the human organism delivering the required medicinal components to the target. The thick extracts of ingredients obtained in the proposed process are the concentrated extracts from the medicinal vegetable feedstock, which feedstock consists of the max. 25% moisture content viscous masses. Usually, they do not flow out of a vessel, but stretch into the threads that fuse then into a continuous mass. The claimed method of preparation of the product "phyto balsam" according to the invention differs from the family members and prior arts by that it uses the structured magnetized alcohol solution that easily and freely penetrates into the intercellular fluids of the human organism. It activates the biological processes and improves the accessibility of the healthful substances from the ingredients. It strengthens the cardiovascular system, reduces the risk of the atherosclerosis, hypertension. It improves the permeability of the cellular membranes, stimulates the metabolism, and favors the excretion of the radionuclides. It purifies the organism, excretes the waste and toxins. It lowers the cholesterol and prevents from the atherosclerosis development. It regulates the arterial blood pressure. It favors the destruction of the stones in the kidneys, gall bladder, and urinary bladder. It accelerates the convalescence at the respiratory diseases. It improves the elasticity and flexibility of the skin. The use of the magnet-treated structured alcohol in the claimed method of preparation of the product "phyto balsam" according to the invention favors the improvement of its efficiency and medicinal qualities, by enhancing the medicinal effect of the medicinal ingredients in the product "phyto balsam" according to the invention. Another distinctive feature of the invention is that in the claimed method of preparation of the product "phyto balsam" according to the invention the ingredients of the medicinal herbs are obtained in form of the 23-25% humidity and 1.25-1.45 kg/dm3 specific weight thick concentrates obtained by evaporating in vacuum units of the aqueous and alcoholic extracts of the ingredients, with the 62-65% extraction ratio, and obligatory elimination from the medicinal herbs exudates of the ballast, compounds in form of albumins, sugar, enzymes, pectin, slime, starch, and other components, wherein the concentrated extracts contain no auxiliary preparations, fillers, preservatives, binders, and/or other auxiliary substances; and the so obtained extracts are preserved until the moment of preparation of the balsam in the structured alcohol and then added into the extractor in the weight fractions according to the formula of product "phyto balsam" according to the invention, taking into account the share of the alcohol used for preservation. The preventive and medicinal qualities of the product "phyto balsam" according to the invention prepared in the claimed process is due also to the possibilities to obtain the high enough accuracy of dosage, to control the concentration of the used medicinal ingredients, and to eliminate the undesirable side effects. The essence of the product according to the invention the is as follows: Today, attempts are made to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms fundamental for the pharmacologic effects of the phyto preparations. It has been shown that the plant origin drugs have effect upon both the cellular and humoral components of the immune system (Sun Y., 1986; Amagava S., 1990; Perushkova A.M. [riepyniKOBa A. M.], et al. 1991). The tannins are known to bind alkaloids; hence, numerous tannins containing plants (e.g., bergenia) are used as medication against poisonings with different poisons. Thus, two plants, one with predominance of the tannins, and the other with the predominance of the alkaloids, are incompatible in a same repertory, because they impair each other's main active factors. As of today, despite the great achievements in development of the chemical drugs, the interest to the natural curative substances and preparations based upon them has grown again. The common medicinal plants have a softer effect on the organism than the chemical drugs and poisonous plants; as a rule, they do not lead to allergy. Preferably ingredients and realizations The use of the special alcohol extracts of the proposed medicinal plants forming «Balsam Cleave Vessels - 3850» is due to their following properties: - Caucasian Dioscorea (Dioscorea caucasica) has a large range of action: it disintegrates the cholesterol plaques on the vessels walls, favoring the lowering of the arterial blood pressure, lowering or disappearance of the headaches, and lowering of the cholesterol in blood; it prevents from the vessels sclerotic lesions; and it cures the already formed focuses of sclerotization.
