Step 3: Preparation of 2-[3-[4-(2-amino-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-8-yl)pyrazole-1 -yl]-1-ethylsulfonyl-azetidine-3-yl]acetonitrile
To 8-(1H-pyrazole-4-yl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-amine(50 mg, 249.7 umol) and 2-(1-ethylsulfonyl-azetidine-3-ylene) acetonitrile(56 mg, 299.7 umol), dissolved in acetonitrile(8 mL), was added dropwise DBU(46 mg, 299.7 umol). The reaction mixture was stirred at 26°C for reacting for 12 hours. After LC-MS showed that the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was distilled under reduced pressure to remove acetonitrile. To the residue was added water(10 mL), and then extracted with EA(10 mL×3). The organic phase was combined, washed with saturated salt water(10 mL), dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and distilled under reduced pressure to remove the filtrate. The residue was purified through silica gel column chromatography(DCM/MeOH=20/1) to give 2-[3-[4-(2-amino-[1,2,4]triazolo [1,5-a]pyridine-8-yl)pyrazole-1-yl]-1-ethylsulfonyl- azetidine-3-yl]acetonitrile(50 mg, 49.22% yield) as a white solid.
