CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/001,725, filed on May 22, 2014, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety BACKGROUND Phosphatidylserine (PS), a membrane phospholipid, is typically localized to the internal surface of the membrane of a healthy cell. Under certain circumstances, PS is also found on the external surface. See Leventis et al., Annu. Rev. Biophys. 2010, 39, 407-27. More specifically, PS is exposed on the external surface of cancer cells. See Thorpe et al., Breast Cancer Res Treat 1995, 36(2), 237-51; Ran et al., Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2002, 54(5), 1479-84; and Thorpe, Thromb. Res. 2010, 125 Suppl 2, S134-137. Further, recent studies found that PS exists in tumor vasculatures and tumor-derived microvessels. See Stafford et al., Neoplasia. 2011, 13, 299-308; and Yin et al., Cancer Immunology Research 2013, 1, 1-13. Moreover, in many pathogenic particles such as bacteria and viruses, PS is exposed at high levels on the external surface. See Huang et al., Cancer Res. 2005, 65(10), 4408-16; and White et al., Bioconjug. Chem. 2010, 21(7), 1297-1304. Finally, PS has been found on the outer surface of cells in which cell death pathways have been dysregulated. For example, in addition to cancer, conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune diseases, and metabolic disorders demonstrate surface localization of PS. See Smith et al., Mol. Pharm. 2011, 8(2), 583-90. Thus, PS provides a valuable target for delivery of therapeutic agents for treating the conditions mentioned above. Protein Annexin V is currently used to deliver therapeutic agents via binding to PS. However, this binding requires high levels of Ca2+, which might activate “scramblases” that could externalize PS in nearby normal cells, resulting in undesired targeting of the normal cells. There is a need to develop a delivery agent that selectively associates with disease-relevant PS to achieve site-specific delivery of a therapeutic agent.

For example, such a composition can be prepared as a solution in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art. A composition having an active compound can also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. The carrier in the pharmaceutical composition must be “acceptable” in the sense that it is compatible with the active ingredient of the composition (and preferably, capable of stabilizing the active ingredient) and not deleterious to the subject to be treated. One or more solubilizing agents can be utilized as pharmaceutical excipients for delivery of an active compound. Examples of other carriers include colloidal silicon oxide, magnesium stearate, cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfate, and D&C Yellow #10. Still within the scope of this invention is a method of treating a condition associated with cells containing inside-out phosphatidylserine. In this condition, normally intracellular phosphatidylserine is exposed on the outer surface of the cells. The method includes administering an effective amount of one of the compounds described above to a subject in need thereof. The compound of formula (I) can be administered as a complex formed of the compound and a metal ion having two or more positive charges (e.g., Zn2+). The condition exists in viral infection, bacterial infection, inflammatory disease, cancer, misregulation of cell death in organ transplant, misregulation of cell death in neurodegenerative disease, and misregulation of cell death in cardiovascular disease. The term “treating” refers to application or administration of the compound to a subject with the purpose to cure, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, improve, or affect the disease, the symptom, or the predisposition. “An effective amount” refers to the amount of the compound which is required to confer the desired effect on the subject. Effective amounts vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on route of administration, excipient usage, and the possibility of co-usage with other therapeutic treatments such as use of other active agents.

The syntheses of Compounds 1-51 and their analytical data are shown below. Synthesis of Dipicolylamine Intermediate (DPA, Structure Shown Below) A dipicolylamine intermediate DPA was prepared according to the following steps: Step 1 To a stirred solution of 5-hydroxyisophthalic acid (25 g, 137 mmol, 1 eq.) in 200 mL of methanol at room temperature, 2,2-dimethoxypropane (1.2 eq.) and p-toluenesulfonic acid (TsOH, 0.2 eq.) were added. After stirring at 60° C., methanol was removed by evaporation. The resultant crude mixture was partitioned in ethyl acetate (EtOAc)/water. The organic layer was dried with magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and concentrated to give a crude product, which was purified by silica-column chromatography to yield 2,2-dimethoxypropane (23 g, 79%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ 3.96 (s, 6H), 7.77 (s, 2H), 8.26 (s, 1H). Step 2 To a solution of dimethyl 5-hydroxyisophthalate (28 g, 133 mmol, 1 eq.) in 1400 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) at ice-bath temperature, lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4 or LAH, 4 eq.) was slowly added with stirring. The resultant mixture was allowed warm to 40° C., stirred at this temperature for 16 hours, and then was added an ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) aqueous solution to quench the reaction. After stirring for 1.5 hours, the mixture was filtered with celite, washed with THF. Organic volatiles were evaporated and the residue was partitioned between water and EtOAc. The aqueous phase was extracted with EtOAc three times. The combined EtOAc layers were dried over MgSO4 to give product (5-hydroxy-1,3-phenylene)dimethanol (17 g, 82%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 4.57 (s, 6H), 6.71 (s, 2H), 6.80 (s, 1H). Step 3 To a stirred solution of (5-hydroxy-1,3-phenylene)dimethanol (7.27 g, 47 mmol, 1 eq.) in 200 mL of acetonitrile at room temperature, 2-(4-bromobutyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione (1.2 eq.) and potassium carbonate (K2CO3, 2 eq.) were slowly added. The resultant mixture was then heated at reflux for 8 hours, after which the volatiles were removed, and the residue was partitioned between EtOAc and water. The EtOAc layer was washed with brine and dried over MgSO4. Evaporation of EtOAc gave 2-(4-(3,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)phenoxy)butyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione (13 g, 78% yield). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 1.67-1.65 (m, 2H), 1.86-1.81 (m, 2H), 3.75 (t, J=5.6 Hz, 2H), 4.00 (t, J=6.0 Hz, 2H), 4.63 (s, 2H), 4.64 (s, 2H), 6.81 (s, 2H), 6.91 (s, 1H), 7.71-7.69 (m, 2H), 7.84-7.82 (m, 2H). Step 4 To a stirred solution of 2-(4-(3,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)phenoxy)butyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione (7.44 g, 21 mmol, 1 eq.) in 420 mL of anhydrous dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) in an ice bath, triphenylphosphine (PPh3, 2.3 eq.) and carbon tetrabromide (CBr4, 4.5 eq.) were slowly added. The resultant reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature, stirred for 16, and added methanol (MeOH) to quench the reaction. After CH2Cl2 and MeOH were evaporated, the residue was partitioned in CH2Cl2/water. The CH2Cl2 layer was dried over MgSO4 and concentrated by evaporation to give a crude product, which was purified by silica-column chromatography to yield product (5.2 g, 51%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ 1.90-1.81 (m, 4H), 3.77 (t, J=6.6 Hz, 2H), 4.00 (t, J=5.7 Hz, 2H), 4.41 (s, 4H), 6.82 (s, 2H), 6.98 (s, 1H), 7.74-7.70 (m, 2H), 7.86-7.84 (m, 2H). Step 5 To a stirred solution of 2-(4-(3,5-bis(bromomethyl)phenoxy)butyl)isoindoline-1,3-dione (3.86 g, 8.06 mmol, 1 eq.) in 25 mL of dry dimethylformamide (DMF) at room temperature, bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)amine (2 eq.) and K2CO3 (5 eq.) were slowly added. After stirring for 16 hours, DMF was evaporated. The resultant crude mixture was partitioned in CH2Cl2/water. The CH2Cl2 layer was dried over MgSO4, and concentrated to give a crude product, which was purified by silica-column chromatography to yield product A (4.8 g, 83%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ 1.89-1.82 (m, 4H), 3.61 (s, 4H), 3.78-3.74 (m, 10H), 3.96 (t, J=6.0 Hz, 2H), 6.82 (s, 2H), 7.03 (s, 1H), 7.12-7.08 (m, 4H), 7.63-7.53 (m, 8H), 7.69-7.67 (m, 2H), 7.82-7.80 (m, 2H), 8.48 (d, J=4.8 Hz, 4H). Step 6 To a stirred solution of compound A (5.9 g, 8.23 mmol, 1 eq.) in 200 mL of ethanol (EtOH) at room temperature, hydrazine (H2N—NH2, 10 eq.) was slowly added. The resultant reaction mixture was stirred for 16 hours, heated at reflux for 2 hours, and then cooled to room temperature. Removal of EtOH gave a crude mixture, which was extracted by CH2Cl2 twice. The CH2Cl2 solutions were combined, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated to afford DPA (4.1 g, 85%). 1H NMR (300 MHz, CDCl3) δ 1.65-1.55 (m, 2H), 1.84-1.75 (m, 2H), 2.75 (t, J=6.9 Hz, 2H), 3.56 (s, 4H), 3.78 (s, 8H), 3.94 (t, J=6.6 Hz, 2H), 6.84 (s, 2H), 7.04 (s, 1H), 7.13-7.08 (m, 4H), 7.63-7.55 (m, 8H), 8.48 (d, J=4.5 Hz, 4H).

Plasma Stability of Zn-DPA Conjugates Zn-DPA conjugates, Zn-DPA-(8), Zn-DPA-(12), Zn-DPA-(25), Zn-DPA-(26), and Zn-DPA-(42) prepared from the corresponding compounds 8, 12, 25, 26, and 42, respectively, were incubated in mouse plasma at 37° C. for up to 24 hours to assess the stability of these conjugates. A sample was analyzed with a High Performance Liquid Chromatography system to determine the concentration of a test conjugate at one of four time points (i.e., 0, 3 hours, 6 hours, and 24 hours). The percentages of the test conjugate remaining at 3, 6, and 24 hours after incubation in the plasma were determined. The results are shown in Table 1 below. A higher percentage indicates greater stability. Among the five test conjugates, Zn-DPA-(26) and Zn-DPA-(42) prepared from Compounds 26 and 42, respectively, were the most stable. After 24 hours of incubation, it was found that 95% or higher of these conjugates remained in the plasma.

Detroit551 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS 50 U/mL of penicillin and streptomycin, and 1% Nonessential amino acids (NEAA; Gibco). Zn-DPA conjugates, Zn-DPA-(8), Zn-DPA-(12), Zn-DPA-(25), Zn-DPA-(26), and Zn-DPA-(42) prepared from the corresponding compounds 8, 12, 25, 26, and 42, respectively, were used to inhibit the growth of human cancer cells (SCM-1, Colo205, MiaPaca2) and human embryonic skin fibroblast cells Detroit551 following the procedures described below. Cell Viability Assay Cell viability was examined by the MTS assay (Promega, Madison, Wis., USA). More specifically, cells were grown (2500˜3000 cells/well) in a flat bottomed 96-well plate for 24 hours. A medium was added along with a test compound at a pre-determined concentration. The cells were further incubated for 72 hours. At the end of the incubation, the medium was removed and diluted with 100 μl of a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium/phenazine methosulfate mixture. The cells were again incubated for 1.5 hours at 37° C. in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 to allow viable cells to convert the tetrazolium salt into formazan. The conversion was determined by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm using a BioTek PowerWave-X Absorbance Microplate Reader. The data obtained were normalized using a vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO)-treated control (100% viability) and a background control (0% viability) to verify growth inhibition. The IC50 value is defined as the concentration of a compound that induces a 50% reduction in cell viability in comparison with a vehicle-treated control. These values were calculated using GraphPad Prism version 4 software (San Diego, Calif., USA). The IC50 values for five Zn-DPA conjugates, i.e., Zn-DPA-(8), Zn-DPA-(12), Zn-DPA-(25), Zn-DPA-(26), and Zn-DPA-(42), were shown in Table 2 below. Also shown in this table are IC50 values for two anticancer compounds, i.e., SN-38 and CPT-11, for comparison. See below for the structures of these two compounds. Note that Zn-DPA-(8), Zn-DPA-(12), Zn-DPA-(25), Zn-DPA-(26), and Zn-DPA-(42), and CPT-11 are prodrugs of the anti-cancer compound SN-38. Zn-DPA-(26), Zn-DPA-(42), and CPT-11 contained SN-38 at about 24%, 18%, and 58%, respectively.

More specifically, Colo205 or MiaPaca2 cells were cultured and maintained in a flask with a RPMI-1640 medium, which was supplemented with 10% FBS. The cells were harvested and innoculated (1×106 cells) subcutaneously into the left flank of a adult male nude mouse. Tumor-bearing mice were grouped at the mean tumor volume of approximately 200 mm3. Tumor dimensions were measured with a digital caliper, and the tumor volume in mm3 was calculated by the formula: Volume=(length×widtĥ2)/2. The mice were housed in sterilized cages equipped with an air filter and sterile bedding materials at the Laboratory Animal Center of National Health Research Institutes. All mice were fed with sterilized water and chow at libitum under 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle throughout the study. Several dosages of Zn-DPA-(26) and Zn-DPA-(42), were used in this assay, i.e., 40 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, p<0.05 vs. vehicle control by one-way ANOVA analysis and the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. Both Zn-DPA-(26) and Zn-DPA-(42) in the mixture of 10% DMSO/20% Cremophor EL/70% dextrose were intravenously administered in a regimen of once daily for five consecutive days when dosed at 20 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg, or of twice per week, for two weeks when dosed at 40 mg/kg; CPT-11 (40 mg/kg) was intravenously administered twice a week for two weeks; and SN-38 (10 mg/kg) in the mixture of 10% DMSO/20% Cremophor EL/10% Na2CO3/60% dextrose was intravenously administered at once daily for five consecutive days for two weeks. Although the amounts of SN-38 contained in Zn-DPA-(26) and Zn-DPA-(42) were only 24% and 18%, respectively (as compared to 58% contained in CPT-11), these two Zn-DPA conjugates were found to unexpectedly show much greater antitumor activities than those of SN-38 and CPT-11 tested in the Colo205 tumor xenograft mouse model. More specifically, it was found that Zn-DPA-(26) unexpectedly showed much higher antitumor activities at dosages of 10 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg, compared to those of SN-38 at 10 mg/kg and CPT-11 at 40 mg/kg; and Zn-DPA-(42), also unexpectedly, showed antitumor activities in a dose-dependent manner and much higher antitumor activities at all three dosages, compared to those of SN-38 at 10 mg/kg and CPT-11 at 40 mg/kg. Moreover, in the MiaPaca2 tumor xenograft mouse model, Zn-DPA-(42) unexpectedly showed antitumor activities in a dose-dependent manner and much higher antitumor activities at dosages of 40 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, compared to those of SN-38 at 10 mg/kg and CPT-11 at 40 mg/kg.
