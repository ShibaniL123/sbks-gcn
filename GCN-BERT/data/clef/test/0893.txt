Step 3: Preparation of N-(5-bromo-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-yl)cyclopropyl carboxamide (4)
To 5-bromo-[1,2,4] triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-amine(15.00 g, 70.41 mmol) and triethylamine(21.4 g, 211.2 mmol), dissolved in acetonitrile(150 mL) was added dropwise cyclopropanecarboxylic acid chloride(8.8 g, 84.5 mmol) at 0°C. After adding, the mixture was warmed to room temperature for the reaction for 16 hours. After TLC showed that the reaction was completed through monitoring, the reaction mixture was distilled under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was dissolved in an alcoholic solution of methylamine(150 mL), heated to 80°C for the reaction for 1 hour, cooled, distilled under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was dissolved in mixed solution of water(100 mL) and ethyl acetate(200 mL), and the layers were separated and extracted. The combined organic phase was dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered, and the filtrate was distilled under reduced pressure. The resulting crude product was purified through silica gel column chromatography (eluting with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether =0∼70%) to give N-(5-bromo-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a] pyridin-2-yl)cyclopropyl carboxamide (7.2 g, 56.64% yield) as a pale yellow solid.
