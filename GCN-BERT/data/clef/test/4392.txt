Step 1. 4-((3-Bromo-4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl)butan-2-one
A mixture of sodium 3-bromo-4-methylbenzenesulfinate (0.20 g, 0.78 mmol) and but-3-en-2-one (70 μL, 0.86 mmol) in AcOH (0.18 mL) and water (1.8 mL) was heated overnight at 110° C. After cooling to rt, the reaction mixture was diluted with water. The aqueous mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3×). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to afford the title compound as a white solid (0.19 g, 80%).
