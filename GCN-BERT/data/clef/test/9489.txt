CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This Application claims the benefit of U.S. Application No. 61/717,690, filed on Oct. 24, 2012 and application Ser. No 13/951,958 filed Jul. 26, 2013. The disclosure of Application No. 61/717,690 and Ser. No. 13/951,958 is hereby incorporated by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The field of invention is the composition and application of catalysts useful for the production of insulating polyurethane foam produced with blowing agents containing a halogen. Polyurethane foam compositions are typically prepared by reacting an isocyanate and a premix which consists of isocyanate-reactive components such as a polyol. The premix optionally also contains other components such as water, flame retardants, blowing agents, foam-stabilizing surfactants, and catalysts to promote the reactions of isocyanate with polyol to make urethane, with water to make CO2 and urea, and with excess isocyanate to make isocyanurate (trimer). The blowing agent in the premix is usually a liquid or gas with a boiling point sufficiently low to be vaporized by the heat released during the polymerization reaction. Examples of blowing agents useful in the production of insulating polyurethane foam include but are not limited to hydrofluorocarbons, hydrofluoroolefins, hydrofluorochloroolefins, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, formates, and hydrocabons. The proper selection and combination of the components in the premix and the isocyanate can be useful for the production of polyurethane foam that is spray applied, poured in place, and used in applications such as refrigerators, freezers, hot water heaters, insulation panels, garage doors, entry doors, and other various applications where insulation is desired. For some of these applications, the premix is stored for one day up to one year before being reacted with isocyanate to generate polyurethane foam. This is common in sprayfoam applications, where drums of premix and isocyanate are shipped to field locations for on-site application. Thus, it is desirable for the premix of an insulating foam formulation to be both chemically and physically stable. However, the catalysts that are useful to promote the polyurethane reaction can also participate or induce undesired reactions with the blowing agents present in the premix resulting in reduced storage stability. These undesired reactions are prevalent in blowing agents that contain halogens, and are especially problematic in halogenated blowing agents containing unsaturation and olefinic carbons. Common amine catalysts useful for the production of polyurethane foam include tertiary amines, such as N,N,N′,N″,N″-pentamethyldiethylenetriamine (available from Air Products as Polycat®-5) or 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (available in solution from Air Products as Dabco® 33LX) which are known to accelerate the urethane reaction promoting the formation of polyurethane polymers. However, tertiary amines are also know to react with halogen containing organic compounds causing deactivation of the tertiary amine catalysts resulting in a net decrease in the kinetic of the polymerization process. Reaction between tertiary amine and halogen containing organic compounds occurs more rapidly when the halogen atom is bound to an olefinic carbon because halogen-substituted olefins are susceptible to nucleophillic attack by tertiary amines. This results in a fast deactivation of the tertiary amine catalysts rendering the premix not active enough for reaction with the isocyanate. Deactivation of tertiary amine by reaction with halogen containing compounds can also occur in halogen containing aliphatic compounds via formation of a quaternary ammonium salt or dehydrohalogenation both pathways resulting in tertiary amine deactivation. U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 20120313035A1, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, describes a foamable composition comprising a hydrohaloolefin blowing agent and an amine catalyst that produce a stable polyol premix. The method includes the use of 1,2-dimethylimidazole, N-methylmorpholine, and other hindered tertiary amines such as diisopropylethylamine catalysts. These catalysts suffer from the drawback that they do not contain isocyanate-reactive groups and thus are emissive from the final polyurethane foam. Additionally, it is demonstrated that reactive amine catalysts such as dimethylaminoethoxyethanol and 2-[N-(dimethylaminoethoxyethyl)]-N-methylamino)ethanol result in an unstable polyol premix in the presence of a hydrohaloolefin. U.S. Pat. Appl. No. 2013019415A1, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, describes a foamable composition comprising a non-emissive catalyst and a tetraalkyl guanidine catalyst. Specifically, the non-emissive catalyst can include 2-[N-(dimethylaminoethoxyethyl)]-N-methylamino]ethanol and dimethylaminoethoxyethanol, and the tetraalkyl guanidine can be tetramethylguanidine. The drawback being that the blowing agent composition is water, and will not produce a closed-cell insulating foam with the same insulation value as a foamable composition utilizing a halogenated blowing agent containing a hydrohaloolefin. W.O. Pat. Appl. No. 2013116416A1 which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, describes a foamable composition comprising an encapsulated amine catalyst and a hydrohaloolefin blowing agent. The drawback being that the amine catalyst is encapsulated in a solid thermoplastic polymer which must be dispersed in the polyol premix. A process, a polyurethane composition, a polyurethane product, a process of producing a catalyst composition, and a catalyst that do not suffer from one or more of the above drawbacks would be desirable in the art.

Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of the preferred aspect or embodiment, taken in conjunction with the accompanying examples which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention. These features as well as the various aspects disclosed herein can be used alone or in combinations with each other. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Provided is an exemplary process, a polyurethane composition, a polyurethane product, a process for making polyurethane foam, a process of producing a catalyst composition, and a catalyst. Embodiments of the present disclosure improve the stability of a premix by minimizing the decomposition of the halogen-containing blowing agent, reducing catalysts deactivation by such decomposition process while providing enough catalytic activity as to provide foam rising speeds that are acceptable for practical use as well as finished products with optimum physical properties. By “stability” it is meant that the pre-mix containing all components of a foamable composition, except isocyanate, after being thermally aged in an oven set at 50° C. (in a sealed container) for 2 weeks will be sufficiently active after aging as to produce foam. During the aging process decomposition of a hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) blowing agent can occur thereby causing the pre-mix to lose its activity. This deactivation can be measured using standard FOMAT equipment and measuring foam rate of rise profiles which consist of recording height versus time as well as foam rise speed versus time during the course of the polymerization process. One suitable way to measure deactivation is by monitoring changes in the time in seconds to reach the time at which the foam has risen to 80% of the maximum height achieved at different periods of time during the aging process. Improvements in catalyst performance can then be measured by recording the changes ΔT=Taged−Tinitial. For example, a formulation that takes 20 seconds to reach 80% of the maximum height achieved when initially prepared, may experience a reactivity decay after storage at 50° C. for two weeks, and then take 30 seconds to reach 80% of the maximum height achieved (as measured by the FOMAT equipment). The ΔT would then be 10 seconds. Thus, when comparing catalyst compositions, smaller changes in ΔT are desired because such smaller changes are associated with lower activity losses during the aging process. Smaller changes in ΔT means, for example, that a suitable spray foam formulation can still produce foam after aging without the need of adding extra fresh catalyst to the premix to prevent sagging, dripping, or collapse of the reactive mixture during application. In order to have a stable foam formulation, it is preferable to have a ΔT change in reactivity of less than about 7 seconds. It is more preferable to have a ΔT change in reactivity of less than about 5 seconds, less than about 4 seconds and in some cases less than about 3 seconds. The inventive catalysts are useful for the production of any rigid insulating foam, and are particularly useful for spray applied foam, appliance insulation, insulating construction panels, and various other insulation products containing closed-cell rigid polyurethane foam. This invention includes foams that have an isocyanate index between about 70 and about 500, about 90 to about 270 and typically about 100 to about 150. The catalysts described in this invention could be used in combination with any halogen-containing blowing agent to provide improved system stability, but they are particularly useful for improving the stability of systems containing hydrohaloolefin blowing agents, such as at least one of HFCO-1234ze (trans-1,3,3,3-Tetrafluoroprop-1-ene) and HFCO-1233zd (1-Propene, 1-chloro-3,3,3-trifluoro), among other HFOs.

In one embodiment, the composition produced is the polyurethane composition. In this embodiment, the process involves reacting the premix, having the tetraalkylguanidine and the tertiary amine having an isocyanate reactive group, with the isocyanate to form the polyurethane composition. The forming of the polyurethane composition includes combining an isocyanate component with the premix.

In one embodiment, the isocyanate component is combined with the premix composition at or about a stoichiometric ratio. In one embodiment, the stoichiometric ratio is based upon an NCO index. The NCO index is the number of equivalents of the isocyanate, divided by the total number of equivalents of active hydrogen, multiplied by 100 (for example, based upon an NCO index being [NCO/(OH+NH)]*100). The polyurethane composition includes the NCO index being within a predetermined range. In one embodiment, the predetermined range is between about 20 and about 500.

The base polyol in the premix reacts with the isocyanate to produce the polyurethane foam composition. In one embodiment, the base polyol is a polyether polyol. Suitable polyether polyols are shown and described in WO 03/016373 A1, WO 01/58976 A1, WO 04/060956 A1, WO 03/016372 A1, and WO 03/055930 A1, each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. In one embodiment, the polyether polyols are poly(alkylene oxide) polymers, such as, poly(ethylene oxide), poly(propylene oxide), and/or compolymers with terminal hydroxyl groups derived from polyhydric compounds (for example, diols and triols).

In this embodiment, the base polyol comprises di-functional and tri-functional materials, such as, but not limited to, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, glycerol-based polyether triols, trimethylolpropane-based polyether triols, other similar compounds or mixtures, or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the polyurea modified polyol is formed by the reaction of a diamine and a diisocyanate in the presence of the starting polyol. In this embodiment, the polyurea modified polyol includes polyurea dispersion. In one embodiment, the polyurea modified polyol is or includes polyisocyanate poly addition (PIPA) polyols, for example, formed in situ from a reaction of the isocyanate and an alkanolamine in the starting polyol. In one embodiment, the base polyol is or includes a natural oil polyol. Generally, the natural oil polyols are less expensive and from renewable resources, thereby providing environmental benefits. The natural oil polyols include triglycerides of saturated and/or unsaturated acids having a carbon chain length between 12 and 24. The saturated acids are lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, steric acid, arachidic acid, lignoceric acid, or a combination thereof. The unsaturated acids are mono-unsaturated (for example, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, or a combination thereof) and/or poly-unsaturated (for example, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, or a combination thereof). One natural oil polyol is castor oil, a natural triglyceride of ricinoleic acid which is commonly used to make polyurethane foam even though it has certain limitations such as low hydroxyl content. Other natural oils need to be chemically modified to introduce sufficient hydroxyl content to make them useful in the production of polyurethane polymers. There are two chemically reactive sites that can be considered when attempting to modify natural oil or fat into a useful polyol: 1) the unsaturated sites (double bonds); and 2) the ester functionality. Unsaturated sites present in oil or fat can be hydroxylated via epoxidation followed by ring opening or hydroformilation followed by hydrogenation. Alternatively, trans-esterification can also be utilized to introduce OH groups in natural oil and fat. The chemical process for the preparation of natural polyols using epoxidation route involves a reaction mixture that requires epoxidized natural oil, a ring opening acid catalyst and a ring opener. Epoxidized natural oils include epoxidized plant-based oils (epoxidized vegetable oils) and epoxidized animal fats. The epoxidized natural oils may be fully or partially epoxidized and these oils include soybean oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, olive oil, canola oil, sesame oil, palm oil, rapeseed oil, tung oil, cotton seed oil, safflower oil, peanut oil, linseed oil and combinations thereof. Animal fats include fish, tallow and lard. These natural oils are triglycerides of fatty acids which may be saturated or unsaturated with various chain lengths from C12 to C24. These acids can be: 1) saturated: lauric, myristic, palmitic, steric, arachidic and lignoceric; 2) mono-unsaturated: palmitoleic, oleic, 3) poly-unsaturated: linoleic, linolenic, arachidonic. Partially or fully epoxidized natural oil may be prepared when reacting peroxyacid under suitable reaction conditions. Examples of peroxyacids utilized in the epoxidation of oils have been described in WO 2006/116456 A1; hereby incorporated by reference. Ring opening of the epoxidized oils with alcohols, water and other compounds having one or multiple nucleophilic groups can be used. Depending on the reaction conditions oligomerization of the epoxidized oil can also occur. Ring opening yields natural oil polyol that can be used for the manufacture of polyurethane products. In the hydroformilation/hydrogenation process, the oil is hydroformylated in a reactor filled with a hydrogen/carbon monoxide mixture in the presence of a suitable catalyst (typically cobalt or rhodium) to form an aldehyde which is hydrogenated in the presence of cobalt or nickel catalyst to form a polyol. Alternatively, polyol from natural oil and fats can be produced by trans-esterification with a suitable poly-hydroxyl containing substance using an alkali metal or alkali earth metal base or salt as a trans-esterification catalyst. Any natural oil or alternatively any partially hydrogenated oil can be used in the transesterification process. Examples of oils include but are not limited to soybean, corn, cottonseed, peanut, castor, sunflower, canola, rapeseed, safflower, fish, seal, palm, tung, olive oil or any blend. Any multifunctional hydroxyl compound can also be used such as lactose, maltose, raffinose, sucrose, sorbitol, xylitol, erythritol, mannitol, or any combination. In one embodiment, the natural oil polyol used as or in the base polyol is castor oil. The castor oil is a natural triglyceride of ricinoleic acid having a low hydroxyl content. In one embodiment, a natural oil or fat is modified to form the natural oil polyol. In this embodiment, an epoxidized natural oil is reacted with a ring opening acid catalyst and a ring opener. The epoxidized natural oil is a plant-based oil, such as epoxidized vegetable oil and/or epoxidized animal fat. Suitable epoxidized natural oils that are plant-based oils include, but are not limited to, soybean oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, olive oil, canola oil, sesame oil, palm oil, rapeseed oil, tung oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, peanut oil, linseed oil, or a combination thereof. Suitable epoxidized natural oils that are epoxidized animal fat are fish fat, tallow, lard, or a combination thereof. Other suitable epoxidized natural oils are shown and described in WO 06/116456 A1, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In one embodiment, the natural oil or the fat is modified by increasing hydroxy content through chemical reaction at unsaturated sites and/or at ester functional groups. For example, in one embodiment, the unsaturated sites are hydroxylated via epoxidation/ring opening and/or hydroformylation/hydrogenation.

Approximately 100 g of the above premix were added to a plastic vessel, closed off, and conditioned in an oven at 50° C. for either 7 or 14 days. The samples were allowed to reach equilibrium at room temperature and then were mixed with the corresponding amount of isocyanate, typically about 25 g of polyol premix and 25 g of isocyanate, under vigorous mechanical stirring provided by a mechanical mixing blade at about 3000 rpm. Foam rise was measured under sonar detection equipment (FOMAT model no V3.5 and standard software included with the FOMAT equipment) and choice time was recorded for each case. Choice times were measured in seconds and it represents the time it takes each foaming mass to reach 80% of the full height. T1 is recorded as the choice time for a premix that was assembled and immediately foamed, and T2 is the choice time after 7 days of conditioning at 50° C., and T3 is the choice time after 14 days of conditioning at 50° C. The ΔT is the reactivity decay or the difference between T3 and T1. Under these conditions, a ΔT of less than 5 seconds is desired to have suitable system stability. In this example, the amine catalyst is a blend of 55% trisdimethylaminopropylamine, 25% N-hexadecyl, N,N-dimethylamine, and 20% pentamethyldiethyltriamine, and the metal catalyst is dibutyltindiluaralmercaptide. This blend is not inventive as it does not contain a tetraalkylguanidine component, nor does it contain a tertiary amine with an isocyanate reactive group. As illustrated by the table below, this catalyst combination shows a significant loss in reactivity upon aging as evident by the high ΔT of 30 seconds. Use T1 T2 T3 ΔT level (sec- (sec- (sec- (T3 − T1) Comparative Catalyst (PPHP) onds) onds) onds) (seconds) Amine: A blend of 55% 1.39 12 20 42 30 trisdimethylaminopropyl- amine, 25% N-hexadecyl-N,N- dimethylamine, and 20% pentamethyldiethyltriamine Metal: 0.35 Dibutyltindiluaralmercaptide Formulation B was also evaluated on a larger scale by machine spray in order to obtain direct correlation data from the FOMAT reactivity evaluation (ΔT or increase in the time it takes the foam to reach 80% of the maximum height) and the actual foam formulation performance as typically applied in commercial applications. To conduct the machine spray evaluations, all components of the polyol premix shown in Table 2 for Formulation B were blended together in a five-gallon metal pail and mixed for several minutes with an air-powered mixer. Spray evaluations were conducted using Graco-HVR equipment at 23° C. and 40% relative humidity conditions. All formulations were sprayed using a Graco gun equipped with an AR4242 mixing chamber. Machine chamber and hose temperatures were set to 125° F. and the dynamic pressure was kept constant between 1200-1500 psig. Formulations were sprayed in 3 passes approximately 1 inch thick each onto a 2×2 ft2 cardboard square bolted on a wood pallet structure horizontal on the floor. Reactivity measurements were conducted by spraying a small amount into a bucket and using a wooden tongue depressor to measure cream time, string-gel time, and tack-free time (in accordance with the method described below)The reactivity measurements in these spray trials were conducted in triplicate and the average for each sample recorded. The initial reactivity measurements were conducted the same day the polyol premix was formulated together. The reactivity measurements on the aged samples were prepared by crimping shut the 5 gallon pail with the fully formulated polyol premix and placing the pail a 50° C. oven for 2 weeks. The polyol premix was then allowed to return to room temperature before spraying. Cream time is the amount of time it takes for the sprayed liquid to begin react and foam on the substrate, measured in seconds. The cream time of a spray foam formulation is preferably between 0.2 and 3 seconds. If the cream time is too long, the formulation will not have adequate viscosity to remain in the desired place and may drip or run off or down the substrate. The string gel time is measured as the time it takes (in seconds) for the sprayed liquid to react enough that the liquid begins to gel, and a string of polymer can be pulled from the foaming mass by touching it with a tongue depressor and pulling away from the foam. It is preferable that the string gel time be between 4 seconds and 15 seconds. If the string gel time is less than 4 seconds, the foaming mass can gel before it is done rising, creating pressure in the foam. If the string gel time is greater than 15 seconds, the foaming mass can sag or fall back on itself if the polymerization reaction has not progressed to the point where the foam can withstand its own weight. The tack free time is the time it takes (in seconds) for the sprayed liquid to react to the point where the foamed mass will no longer stick to a tongue depressor when lightly tapped on the surface of the foam. The tack free time is preferably between 5 and 20 seconds. The results in the table below illustrate the significant decay of the reactivity of the comparative system after storage at 50° C. for two weeks.
