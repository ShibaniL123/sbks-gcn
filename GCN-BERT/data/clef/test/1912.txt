Step 3: Preparation of compound of N-(8-(1-(3-(cyanomethyl)-1-(ethylsulfonyl) azetidine-3-yl)-1H-pyrazole-4-yl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-yl) cyclopropanecarboxamide(WX20)
To N-[8-(1H-pyrazole-4-yl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-2-yl) cyclopropanecarboxamide(100 mg, 372.8 umol) and 2-(1-ethylsulfonyl azetidine-3-yl) acetonitrile(83 mg, 447.3 umol), dissolved in acetonitrile(15 mL), was added dropwose DBU(68 mg, 447.3 umol). The formed mixture was stirred at 26°C for reacting for 12 hours. After TLC showed that the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was distilled under reduced pressure to remove the solvent. The residue was dissolved in DCM(15 mL) and water(10 mL). The organic layer was separated and the water layer was extracted with DCM(15 mL×2) twice. The organic phase was combined, washed with saturated salt water(10 mL), dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and distilled under reduced pressure to remove the filtrate. The residue was purified through preparative HPLC (alkaline method) to give (WX20)(65 mg, 37.98% yield):
