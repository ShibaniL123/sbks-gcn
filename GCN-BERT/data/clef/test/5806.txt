(S)-4-[4-cyano-2-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-3,6-dimethyl-2-oxo-1-[3-(trifluormethyl)phenyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-5-carboxylic Acid, Allyl Ester (XXIII)
(S)-4-[4-cyano-2-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-6-methyl-2-oxo-1-[3-(trifluormethyl)phenyl]-1,2,3,4-tetra-hydropyrimidine-5-carboxylic acid, allyl ester (X) (250 g, 0.481 mol) was prepared at 20° C. in THF (1.25 l) and combined with a 1 M solution of sodium hexamethyldisilazide (NaHMDS) in THF (102 g; 0.554 mol). After 10 min of stirring, dimethylsulfate was added (122 g; 0.964 mol) and the mixture was stirred for 2 h at RT. The reaction mixture was added to a solution of 26% aqueous ammonia solution (178 g; 2.4 mol) in 1.5 l of water and rinsed with 200 ml of THF. Stirring was done overnight and cooling to 5° C. The product was filtered off and washed with water (0.6 l). Drying was done at 40° C. in vacuum.
Yield: 230 g (89% of theory) of a beige-colored solid.
