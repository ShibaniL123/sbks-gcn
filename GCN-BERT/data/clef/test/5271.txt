CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2009-0037771, filed on Apr. 29, 2009 with the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. TECHNICAL FIELD The disclosure generally relates to photocurable coating compositions for optical products, and, more particularly, to photocurable coating compositions that include a (meth)acryloyl monomer, a (meth)acryloyl oligomer, an organic solvent and a diluted monomer. BACKGROUND OF RELATED ART Polymeric materials are used in a variety of optical products due to their being lightweight and inexpensive to produce. Polycarbonates, for example, are characterized by excellent clarity, resistance to discoloration, high strength and high impact resistance. Most polymers are synthesized by either a thermal or photocuring process. Variations in these curing processes may influence the performance of the prepared polymer. For example, thermal polymerization may be accompanied by high shrinkage during cure, for example, in the range of from about 10 to about 20%, and extended curing times, for example, in the range of from about 5 to about 16 hours or more. The high shrinkage levels create difficulties in the production of precision optics such as lenses or prisms, particularly in the production of articles having larger thicknesses or large differences in thickness between the center and the edges of the article. The extended cure times tie up production facilities, and may lead to inefficient utilization of the dies in which the articles are molded. Also, the thermal cure cycle used to polymerize the monomer consumes large amounts of energy, and may thermally stresses the dies. With respect to the photocuring process, polymeric reactions may be initiated by irradiation at a wavelength of about 780 nm or less, especially, in the range of the ultraviolet (UV) spectra, for example, in the range of from about 10 to about 380 nm. These reactions progress rapidly to form numerous chains between the monomers and/or oligomers. Owing to characteristics of this reaction, it may not be possible to determine the precise molecular weight of the polymer obtained by photocuring, as well as the glass transition temperature (Tg). However, increasing the molecular weight of a polymeric material generally improves the density, and may thereby enhances the toughness and hardness of the material. High molecular weight polymers may be formed into optical products by either an injection or extrusion process. Optical products prepared by these processes however may have certain disadvantages such as, for example, shrinkage after polymerization; cracking caused by temperature and/or moisture variations; expansion due to moisture absorption resulting in reduced birefringence, and so forth. As an increasing number of polymeric electronic products are manufactured employing high intensity light, the heat (with a temperature in the range of from about 60 to about 160° C.) to which those parts directly in contact with the light source are subjected may cause problems such as reduced dimensional stability and surface aging. Also, optical products that are stored and operated under conditions of high temperature and high humidity (for example more than about 40° C. and 75% RH) experience a shortened lifespan. Thus, there remains a need in the art for improved polymeric materials for use in optical products.

For further illustration of various aspects of the present disclosure, several specific examples will now be described. It should be understood however that these examples are for illustrative purposes only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure. PREPARATIVE EXAMPLE 80 parts by weight of methacrylate, 20 parts by weight of 2-ethylhexyl acrylate oligomer, and 70 parts by weight of a mixture including ethyl acetate and ethyl acrylate as a diluted monomer are mixed together and applied to a thermosetting polycarbonate plate having a size of 50 mm×50 mm×3 mm.

The coated plate is then subjected to UV irradiation at 320 nm with a radiation rate of 500 mJ/cm3, so as to complete the photocuring process. EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 1 The thermosetting polycarbonate plate coated using the photocurable coating composition prepared in the PREPARATIVE EXAMPLE and an uncoated polycarbonate plate as a control are exposed to a high temperature (80° C.) for 200 hours. The analysis of the visible light transmittance and variation in color coordinate may be performed for both polycarbonate plates and the result are shown in the following Table 1. TABLE 1 Control Polycarbonate plate (thermosetting prepared in Preparative polycarbonate Example (coating plate) thickness: ≦0.1 mm) Visible light Before test 82% 90% transmittance After test 78 to 80% 89.5 to 90% Variation in Before test — — color coordinate After test 0.6 to 1.2 0.4 to 0.9 (ΔLab) As shown in TABLE 1, the polycarbonate plate coated using the disclosed photocurable coating composition prepared in the PREPARATIVE EXAMPLE exhibits no substantial variation in visible light transmittance and relatively reduced variation in color coordinate, as compared to the control. EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 2 The thermosetting polycarbonate plate coated using the photocurable coating composition prepared in the PREPARATIVE EXAMPLE and an uncoated polycarbonate plate as a control are exposed to a high temperature (60° C.) and a high humidity (80% RH) for 200 hours. The analysis of the visible light transmittance and variation in color coordinate may be performed for both polycarbonate plates and the results are shown in the following Table 2. TABLE 2 Control Polycarbonate plate (thermosetting prepared in Preparative polycarbonate Example (coating plate) thickness: ≦0.1 mm) Visible light Before test 82% 90% transmittance After test 32 to 78% 86 to 89% Variation in Before test — — color coordinate After test 1.8 to 4.2 0.9 to 1.5 (ΔLab) As shown in Table 2, the polycarbonate plate coated using the photocurable coating composition prepared, in the PREPARATIVE EXAMPLE exhibits no substantial variation in visible light transmittance and relatively reduced variation in color coordinate, as compared to the control. Therefore, it was found that the transparency per local part of the plate was uneven after testing. Visible light transmittance and variation in color coordinate may be slightly altered depending on the thickness and degree of curing of the material. In general, as the material becomes thicker, the effects of temperature and/or humidity are decreased. The material with a higher degree of curing shows reduced effects of temperature and/or humidity. Hence, when the material has increased thickness and a higher degree of curing, the variation in physical properties may be only slightly reduced, while the time and cost required for formation of the shaped products are considerably increased. EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLE 3 The thermosetting polycarbonate plate coated using the photocurable coating composition prepared in the PREPARATIVE EXAMPLE and an uncoated polycarbonate plate as a control are positioned at a distance of 0.5 mm or less from a white LED (FCW 301Z, available from Seoul Semiconductor Inc. of Republic of Korea). The time at which thermal deformation or blushing of the white LED occurs is measured over 96 hours. The surface temperature of the used white LED ranged from 120 to 140° C. The measured results are shown in the following Table 3. TABLE 3 Preparative Example Control (coating thickness: ≦0.02 mm) Time at which thermal Within 15 Not occurred deformation or blushing minutes occurs (blushing is first observed) As shown in Table 3, the results of the lighting test using white LEDs demonstrate that the polycarbonate plate coated with the disclosed photocurable coating composition have superior heat resistance over the uncoated plate. Blushing refers to a phenomenon wherein a surface of a material is finely cracked, causing diffused reflection of light and resulting in a cloudy surface. FIG. 1 provides illustrative example of photographic images of the surface of a material before and after blushing. For EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLES 1 and 2, the phenomena generated in polymer resins at high temperature and humidity may be understood from the schematic views shown in FIG. 2. For a polymer material, the molecular weight of the material may be larger with an increase number of bonds between the monomers or oligomers. For the same material, when the molecular weight increases, the thermal variation is reduced (that is, the Tg is raised) while mechanical strength is increased (that is, the tensile strength and surface hardness are increased). EXAMPLE 1 A CCD module or a contact image sensor (CIS) module is a device typically found in an apparatus for reading images, for example, a copier, scanner, a facsimile, or the like. Such image sensor of an image reading apparatus may comprise a light source 1 and an optical sensor. In recent years, products using LEDs as the light source for CCD or CIS modules have become available. However, even in such products, a light guide may still be used in order to provide a linear light source (i.e., a line source) as an LED is a point light source. For example, as illustrated in FIG. 3, an example of such image sensor may include a light source, e.g., one or more LEDs 1 and a light guide 2. As the speed at which the image sensors are required to read images becomes faster, increasingly higher light level (or light intensity) of the light, source is becoming necessary, which in turn increases the current or voltage applied to the light source. For a semiconductor device, an increase in the heat dissipation may be attendant the higher power consumption. Known ways in which to address such heat dissipation issues may not be enough for the light intensity that may be necessary in order to satisfy the demand for the ever increasing level of throughput for the reading devices. For the purposes of illustration, using an LED (for example, a power LED product FCW 301Z available from Seoul Semiconductor Inc. of Republic of Korea), the heat dissipation temperature as a function of the applied current at ambient temperature may be measured. From the measured results, it is found that the temperature is raised to about between 120° C. and 140° C. at 250 mA. At such a high temperature, it is likely that blushing on the surface of a light guide may occur. In this case, the light loss and/or the variation in light distribution on the surface of the subject document being read may result. Prolonged or repeated exposure to such high temperature may cause the blushing to grow worse over time, or may even cause surface cracks and/or reduced dimensional stability of the light guide. The photocurable coating composition according to one or more aspect of the present disclosure may be applied to, for example, on the two end surfaces, of the light guide. For example, referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the photocurable coating composition described herein that comprises 55 parts by weight of diluted monomer is applied to the two end surfaces 3 of the light guide 2 that face the LED 1 by dip coating. After drying the coated light guide in a drying oven at 60° C. for 3 minutes, the light guide is subjected to light irradiation at 300 mJ/cm3 using a UV radiator equipped with a mercury lamp as a light source. The light guide 2 with its end surface 3 treated with the photocurable coating composition according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure is arranged on a CCD module, and then, is left for 96 hours under current conditions of applying 250 mA to the LED 1. No blushing or other thermal deformation were observed on the coated surfaces 3. FIG. 5 illustrates another example in which the light guide 2 receives light from two light sources, e.g., LEDs 1, arranged respectively on the two end surfaces 3 of the light guide 2. In such configuration, one or both of the end surfaces may be coated with the photocurable coating composition according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure. EXAMPLE 2 In a backlight unit (BLU) of a display apparatus, a point light source such as an LED or a linear light source such as CCFL, HCFL, or the like are used. A light guide panel (LGP) or a diffuse plate is also used for converting the point light source or the linear light source into a planar source. The LGP or diffuse plate may be fabricated using light permeable thermosetting resin such as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), Zeoner, polycarbonate (PC), and the like. Problems such as thermal deformation or blushing due to strong heat of the light source on certain parts of the LGP in contact or close proximity with the light source may be encountered. For example, as shown in FIG. 6, if a portion or portions of the light guide panel 2′ that are in contact with or in close proximity to a light source 1′ such as an LED or CCFL as well as the periphery of the light guide panel are coated using the photocurable coating composition according to one or more embodiments herein to form a coating layer 3′ with a thickness of about 3 to about 20 μm, damage of the LGP or diffuse plate caused by heat may be effectively reduced.
