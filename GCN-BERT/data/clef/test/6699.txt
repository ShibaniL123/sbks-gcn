To a solution of 5-Bromo-4-methoxy-pyridin-2-ylamine (53 g, 0.261 mol, 1.0 eq.) in EtOH:H2O=4:1 (500 mL) is added chloro-acetaldehyde (24.589 g, 0.313 mol, 1.2 eq.), then NaHCO3 (26.3 g, 0.313 mol, 1.2 eq.) is added. The resultant mixture is heated to 90° C. for 4 h. After cooling to r.t., the organic solvent is evaporated. The residue is extracted with DCM (200 mL×3). The organic layer are combined, dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The crude product is purified by silica gel chromatography (DCM:MeOH=50:1) to afford compound 6-Bromo-7-methoxy-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine (39 g, 66%) as a brown solid.
