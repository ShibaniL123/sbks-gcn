CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/360,636, filed Jul. 1, 2010, and titled “LACE GUIDE,” the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of this specification for all that it discloses. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention Embodiments of the present invention relate to lacing systems for wearable articles (e.g., shoes, bags, clothing, etc.), and more particularly to lace guides for use with lacing systems. 2. Description of the Related Art Although various lacing systems are available for use in connection with various wearable articles, there remains a need for improved lace guides for use with lacing systems. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In an example embodiment, a lace guide can include a lace channel configured to slidably receive a lace, a first opening at a first end of the lace channel, an axis extending out of the lace channel through the first opening, a second opening at a second end of the lace channel, and a first flange positioned at the first opening. The first flange can have a lower portion positioned below the first opening and an upper portion positioned above the first opening, and the lower portion can extend axially further away from the lace channel than does the upper portion such that the lower portion forms a sliding surface for the lace to slide on as the lace moves through the lace guide. The lace guide can further include a second flange positioned at the second opening, and the second flange can have a lower portion that extends axially away from the lace channel to form a sliding surface for the lace to slide on as the lace moves through the lace guide. The first flange can be shaped such that a line drawn from the end of the lower portion of the first flange to the end of the upper portion of the first flange is angled with respect to the lace channel by an angle between about 5° and about 85°. The first flange can be shaped such that a line drawn from the end of the lower portion of the first flange to the end of the upper portion of the first flange is angled with respect to the lace channel by an angle between about 10° and about 80°. The first flange can be shaped such that a line drawn from the end of the lower portion of the first flange to the end of the upper portion of the first flange is angled with respect to the lace channel by an angle between about 30° and about 60°. The first flange can be shaped such that a line drawn from the end of the lower portion of the first flange to the end of the upper portion of the first flange is angled with respect to the lace channel by an angle of about 45°. The lower portion of the first flange can include a curved surface providing at least a portion of the sliding surface for the lace, the curved surface having a radius of curvature between about 2 millimeters and about 10 millimeters. The lower portion of the first flange can include a curved surface providing at least a portion of the sliding surface for the lace, the curved surface having a radius of curvature between about 4 millimeters and about 8 millimeters. The lower portion of the first flange can include a curved surface providing at least a portion of the sliding surface for the lace, the curved surface having a radius of curvature of about 5 millimeters. The lace channel can include a main channel configured to receive the lace, and an open channel that connects the main channel to outside the lace guide, and at least a portion of the main channel can be wider than the open channel thereby forming a front undercut along a front side of the main channel and a back undercut along the back side of the main channel. In some embodiments, a lace can have an outer surface, and at least the sliding surface on the first flange can be formed from a material that is softer than the outer surface of the lace. In some embodiments, the at least a portion of the main channel can be formed from a material that is softer than the outer surface of the lace. In another example embodiment, a lace guide can include a lace channel configured to slidably receive a lace, the lace channel providing a curved lace path through the lace guide; a first opening at a first end of the lace channel; a second opening at a second end of the lace channel; and a first flange positioned at the first opening, the first flange having a lower portion that extends away from the lace channel to form a sliding surface for the lace to slide on as the lace moves through the lace guide. The lace channel can be at least about 10 mm in length. The lace channel can be substantially U-shaped such that lace channel has a first direction at the first opening and a second direction at the second opening. In some embodiments, the first opening faces in a first direction and is configured to direct the lace generally in the first direction and the second opening can face in a second direction and can be configured to direct the lace generally in the second direction. An angle formed between the first direction and the second direction can be less than about 45°. The angle formed between the first direction and the second direction can be less than about 30°.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a lacing system 100 used for tightening a shoe 102. Although various embodiments described herein are discussed in the context of tightening a shoe, the lacing system disclosed herein can likewise be used to tighten other objects, including but not limited to gloves, hats, belts, braces, boots, jackets, pants, or other wearable articles. The lacing system 100 can include a mechanism for imparting and/or holding tension on a lace. For example, the lacing system 100 can include a lace winder 104 configured to draw a lace 106 into the lace winder 104 as a knob of the lace winder 104 is twisted. The lace winder 104 can be positioned on the back of the shoe, as is shown in FIG. 1, or on the side or tongue of the shoe 102, or in any other suitable position that allows the lace 106 to be fed into and out of the lace winder 104. In some embodiments, the lacing system 100 may include more than one lace winder or other mechanism for holding the tension on the lace or may not include any such mechanism. The lace 106 used with the lacing system 100 can be a variety of different lace types. In some embodiments, the lace can be made of stranded steel cable with no coating, stranded steel cable with a polymer coating (e.g., nylon coating), monofilament (e.g., nylon), or braided Spectra®. Preferably, the lace 106 has a modulus of elasticity of at least about 20,000 psi and/or no more than about 1,000,000 psi. The lace 106 can have a diameter of at least about 0.015 inches and preferably no more than about 0.1 inches, although diameters outside these ranges can also be used. In some embodiments the lace 106 can have a diameter of about 0.03 inches. The lacing system can include one or more lace guides 108 configured to guide the lace 106 through the lacing system 100 so that the sides of the shoe 102 or other article are drawn together when the lace 106 tightened by, for example, the lace winder 104. The lace guides 108 can be configured to reduce or minimize friction thereby substantially evenly distribute the force imposed by the tightened lace 106 along the lacing zone, thereby avoiding pressure points which can cause discomfort and impaired performance. The guides 108 can provide a lace path that resists allowing the lace 106 to turn about any sharp corners of less than about a 5 mm radius when the lace 106 is tightened. In some embodiments, the guides can provide a lace path that includes no corners of less than about a 3 mm radius, or no corners of less than about a 7 mm radius, or no corners of less than about a 10 mm radius, although curvatures outside of these ranges are also possible. The reduction or elimination of sharp turns from the lace path can prevent fatigue of the lace 106 and can reduce the friction and wear on lace 106 and on the guides 108 as well. Removing sharp turns from the lace path can be increasingly advantageous in embodiments where laces of larger diameters, and harder, less flexible, materials are used. In some embodiments, harder and less flexible laces (e.g., steel cable laces) can allow for increased tension to be applied to the lacing system. The lacing system 100 can be configured to tighten with about 2.5 pounds of force in some embodiments, although a much higher tension of up to about 100 pounds can be used in some embodiments (e.g., snowboard boots). When the force is concentrated on a smaller lace thickness, and the force is not significantly absorbed by a softer lace material, and the force is not significantly absorbed by stretching of the lace, it can be particularly advantageous to avoid sharp turns in the lace path. In some embodiments, a hidden portion of the lace guides 108 can be disposed under a portion of the article such that the hidden portion is hidden or substantially hidden from view, and an exposed portion of the lace guides 108 can be disposed on the exterior of the article such that the exposed portion is visible. For example, in some embodiments, the one or more of the lace guides 108 can include a lace channel 110 that is disposed under a portion of the shoe or other article. In some embodiments, the covering portion of the shoe or article is opaque or substantially opaque and substantially hides the channel 110. FIG. 2 is another view of the lacing system 100 and shoe 102 with the lace channels 110 shown schematically by dotted lines that follow the path of the lace 106 through the lace guides 108. In some embodiments, one or more of the lace guides 108 can include an end piece 112 positioned at the end of a lace channel 110 such that the end piece 112 is positioned on the exterior of the article where it is exposed and visible. Disposing a portion of the lace guides 108 within the shoe can provide the shoe with a more aesthetically pleasing appearance, can protect portions of the lace guides 108 from damage, can prevent items from becoming snagged on external lace guides (especially during sports activities), can allow for the use of deeper lace paths that more accurately follow the natural curvature of the lace 106, and can permit the use of softer materials for some or all of the lace guide 108. In some embodiments, the exposed end pieces 112 of the lace guides 108 can have an appearance similar to conventional shoelace eyelets which can be a desirable aesthetic feature. In some embodiments, the end pieces 112 can be have a non-uniform flange extending around at least a portion of the openings to the lace channels 110. The end pieces can be, for example, substantially bell-shaped and can provide a curved sliding surface for the lace 106 to ride against as it is tightened, to prevent the lace 106 from turning a tight corner as it enters or exits the lace guide 108 and reduce friction and wear on the lace 106 and on the lace guide 108. Thus, some embodiments provide the appearance of spaced apart eyelets while still providing a structured lace channel between the eyelets. In some instances, the lacing system 100 can use one or more double-end-piece lace guides 108a. For example, as can be seen in FIG. 2, a double-end-piece lace guide 108a can have a generally U-shaped lace channel 110 that connects a first opening 114a and a second opening 114b, and each of the first and second openings 114a-b can have an exposed end piece 112 attached thereto. In some embodiments, the end pieces 112 are spaced away from the edges of the shoe that are drawn together by the lacing system. By spacing the lace guides 108 away from the edges, tension applied to the lace 106 can be more evenly distributed than if the openings to the lace guides were positioned directly on or adjacent to the edges. Distributing the tension from the opening to the edge may facilitate movement of the edge across the tongue, reducing the likelihood of tongue bunching. In some instances, the lacing system 100 can use one or more single-end-piece lace guides 108b. A single-end-piece lace guide 108b can have a lace channel 110 with a first opening 114a that includes an exposed end piece 112, while the second opening 114b at the other end of the lace channel 100 does not include an exposed end piece 112. The unexposed opening 114b can, for example, direct the lace 106 toward the lace winder 104, as is the case in FIGS. 1-2. FIG. 3 is a top-front perspective view of a double-end-piece lace guide 300. FIG. 4 is a bottom-rear perspective view of the lace guide 300. The lace guide 300 can include a lace channel 302 with a first opening 304 at a first end of the lace channel 302 and a second opening 306 as a second end of the lace channel 302. In the illustrated embodiment, the lace channel 302 is generally U-shaped, although the lace channel 302 can follow a path having other shapes. For example, the lace channel 302 can be generally linear, or generally S-shaped, etc. A first end piece 308 can be positioned at the first opening 304 and a second end piece 310 can be positioned at the second opening 306. The end pieces 308, 310 can be generally bell-shaped, as shown in the illustrated embodiments, but other shapes can also be used. The lace guide 300 can include a stitch flange 312, which can, for example, have a middle portion 312a that extends between portions of the lace channel 302, a first end portion 312b that extends away from the lace channel 302 in a first direction, and a second end portion 312c that extends away from the lace channel 302 in a second direction. In some embodiments, the lace guide 300 can be formed as a single integral piece. Various materials and processes can be used to form the lace guide 300. For example, the lace guide can be injection molded or otherwise formed from any suitable polymeric material, such as nylon, PVC or PET. In some embodiments, at least some portions of the lace guide 300 can be can be formed from a lubricious plastic such as PTFE, or other material useful in reducing the friction between a lace and portions of the lace guide configured to interact with the lace. In some embodiments, portions of the lace guide 300 can be coated, impregnated, blended, or layered with a lubricious material to reduce the friction with interacting components or parts. In some embodiments, the lace guide 300 can be formed from a material that is generally rigid or semi-rigid. In some embodiments, the lace guide 300 can be generally flexible, so that it can conform to the shape of a shoe (or other article) associated with the lace guide 300, especially in cases in which the shoe may bend when in use. In some embodiments, the lace channel 302 can have an open bottom. FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view of the lace guide 300 taken through a midline through the lace guide 300. The lace channel 302 can include a main channel 316 that is configured to receive a lace, and an open channel 318 that provides an opening from the main channel 316 to the exterior of the lace guide 300 via the open bottom 314 and can facilitate and can facilitate the manufacture thereof. In some embodiments, open channel 318 can be thinner than the main channel 316. For example, the open channel 318 can be thinner than the lace received by the main channel 316 such that the lace does not exit the lace channel 302 via the open channel 318 or become wedged in the open channel 318. In some embodiments, the open channel 318 can be at least about 0.5 mm wide, and/or no more than about 1.5 mm wide, and in some instances can be about 1.0 mm wide, although other dimensions outside of these ranges can be used, especially depending on the diameter of the lace to be used. The main channel 316 can be at least about 1.0 mm wide, and/or no more than about 3.0 wide, and in some instances can be about 2.0 mm wide, although other dimensions outside of these ranges can be used, especially depending on the diameter of the lace to be used. In some embodiments, the main channel 316 can be about twice as wide as the open channel 318. In some embodiments, the main channel 316 may vary in size from one opening to the other. A back undercut 320 can be formed at the transition from the main channel 316 to the open channel 318 on the back side of the lace channel 302. The back undercut 320 can be curved as shown, or it can be an angled step. The back undercut 320 can facilitate the initial threading of the lace through the lace channel 302, for example, by preventing the lace from dropping down into the open channel 318. A front undercut 322 can be formed at the transition between the main channel 316 and the open channel 318 on the front side of the lace channel 302. The front undercut 322 can aid in keeping the lace in proper position in the main channel 316 when tightened. In some embodiments, the front undercut 322, the back undercut 320, and/or both may be eliminated along some or all of the lace channel 302. The open bottom 314 of the lace guide 300 can facilitate the molding of the lace guide 300. The lace guide 300, or at least the lace channel 302 portion thereof, can be injection molded with an insert piece used to form the main channel 316 and the open channel 318. The insert piece can have a wider top portion and a narrower lower portion that correspond to the wider main channel 316 and narrower open channel 318. Once the lace guide 300 is molded, the insert piece can be removed from the lace channel 302 by applying a force that pulls the insert piece out through the open bottom 314. In some embodiments, the walls of the lace channel 302 can flex as the wide top portion of the insert piece passes through the narrow open channel 318. To facilitate removal of the insert piece, in some embodiments, the lace guide 300, or at least the lace channel 302 portion thereof, can be made of a somewhat soft or flexible material. However, in some embodiments, a material is used that is hard enough to withstand the tension applied by the lacing system without damaging the lace guide 300 or tearing out stitches or other fasteners that attach the lace guide 300 to the shoe. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the lace guide 300, or at least the portions of the lace guide 300 that contact the lace during use, can be formed from a material that is softer than the outer surface of the lace. Thus, after repeated use, the softer material of the lace guide 300 will wear before the outer surface of the lace. This can be advantageous in some embodiments because wearing out the outer surface of the lace can expose the inner layers of the lace and can weaken the lace or give the appearance that integrity of the lace has been compromised even when it hasn't. If the lace guide 300 is made of a material that is softer than the outer surface of the lace, then lace guide 300 will tend to wear down instead of the lace thereby preserving lace integrity and the appearance thereof. Because some of the contact points between the lace guide 300 and the lace are inside the lace channel 302, the worn portion of the lace guide can be hidden from view. In some embodiments, a material can be used to form the lace guide that has a hardness of at least about 60 Shore D and/or no more than about 85 Shore D, although other hardness values can also be used. In some embodiments, different portions of the lace guide 300 can have different levels of hardness. For example, in some embodiments, the stitch flange 312 can be formed from a harder material that the lace channel 302, for example, by overmolding the stitch flange over the lace channel 302. A differential of 5 to 25 Shore D could be advantageous. Thus, the lace channel 302 can be configured to bend and flex with the shoe (or other article) during use, while the stitch flange 312 can remain relatively rigid to hold the lace guide 300 in place. The harder material of the stitch flange 312 can also reduce the likelihood that stitches will tear through the stitch flange 312. In some embodiments, the lace guide 300 can be formed from multiple pieces. For example, the lace channel 302 can be formed as a separate piece than the end pieces 308, 310 which can be attached to the ends of the lace channel 302 using an adhesive, sonic welding, a snap fit structure, or any other suitable attachment method. FIG. 6 shows an exploded perspective view of another embodiment of a double-end-piece lace guide 600, which in some ways can be similar to, or the same as, the lace guide 300, or any other lace guide disclosed herein. The lace guide 600 can be a two part construction formed from an upper portion 601 and a lower portion 603. The upper portion 601 can include an upper lace channel portion 602a, and upper portions of the first and second end pieces 608a, 610a. The lower portion 603 can include a lower portion of the lace channel 602b and lower portions of the first and second end pieces 608b, 610b. In some embodiments, the end pieces can be formed as complete integral pieces with the lower portion 603 such that the upper portion 601 includes only the top of the lace channel 602a. The upper portion 601 can be attached to the lower portion 603 by an adhesive, sonic welding, a snap fit connection, or any other suitable type of connection or fastener. In some embodiments, the upper portion 601 and the lower portion 603 can include tabs 605 and corresponding holes 607 to facilitate the alignment and attachment of the upper portion 601 and the lower portion 603. A main channel 616 can be configured to receive a lace that passes through the lace guide 600. An upper portion of the main channel 616a (hidden from view in FIG. 6) can be formed in the bottom surface of the upper portion 601, and a lower portion of the main channel 616b can be formed in the top surface of the lower portion 603. Because the upper and lower portions 601, 603 can be molded separately, the main channel 616 can be made without having an open bottom. When the lace guide 600 is assembled, the main channel 616 can be fully enclosed except for the first and second openings 604, 606. This can reduce the occurrence of the lace becoming wedged in the open channel, and the ingress of debris into the channel. Referring again to FIG. 5, other two part constructions are possible. For example a lace guide can be formed has an open bottom lace channel similar to that shown in the lace guide 300, and a second piece can attach to the lace guide to fill the open channel 318, thereby forming a main channel 316 that is enclosed except for the first and second openings 304, 306. FIG. 7 is a cross-sectional view of the lace guide 300 taken at a midpoint through the opening 306. The channel 302 can define an axis E which passes through the center of the opening 306 and extends in the direction of a tangent line to the curvature of the lace channel 302 at the opening 306. In some embodiments, the end piece 310 can include a flange extending generally radially (with respect to the axis E extending out of the lace channel 302 via the opening 306) away from the main channel 316. The flange can have a diameter 311 that is larger than an outer diameter 313 of the lace channel 302, thereby forming a ridge or step 315 that extends around the flange. The flange can have an upper flange portion 326 and a lower flange portion 328. As shown, the lower flange portion 328 can extend axially (with respect to the axis E extending out of the lace channel 302 via the opening 306) out away from the lace channel 302 further than does the upper flange portion 326. In some embodiments, a line A drawn from the outer end of the lower flange portion 328 to the outer end of the upper flange portion 326 can be offset from a line B drawn parallel to the lace channel 302 (or parallel to the main channel 316 therein) by an angle 324. The angle 324 can be at least about 5° and/or no more than about 85°, at least about 10° and/or no more than about 80°, at least about 15° and/or no more than about 75°, at least about 30° and/or no more than about 60°, or about 45°, although angles outside of these ranges can also be used. The upper flange portion 326 can be more curved than the lower flange portion 328. In some embodiments, the upper flange portion 326 can have a radius of curvature of at least about 1.0 millimeter because the lace will generally not ride against this surface and/or of no more than about 3.0 millimeters, or of about 2.0 millimeters, although curvatures outside of these ranges can be used. In some embodiments, the lower flange portion 328 can have a radius of curvature of at least about 4.0 millimeters and/or no of more than about 15.0 millimeters, or of about 10.0 millimeters, although curvatures outside of these ranges can be used. In some embodiments, the curvature of the generally bell-shaped end piece 310 can vary gradually from the least curved portion 328 to the most curved portion 326. In some embodiments, the end piece 310 is not rotationally symmetrical about the axis formed by the opening 306. In some embodiments, the end piece 310 is not symmetrical across a horizontal plane, but is symmetrical across a vertical plane. The surface of the bell-shaped end piece 310 can provide a sliding surface on which the lace can slide as it moves in and out of the opening 306. In some embodiments, the lace enters the opening 306 from a somewhat sideways direction such that the sliding surface is a portion of the end piece 310 that is between the least curved portion 328 and the most curved portion 326 when the lace is tightened. In some embodiments, the sliding surface can be closer to the least curved lower portion 328 than to the most curved upper portion 326 of the end piece 310. The sliding surface can have a radius of curvature of at least about 2.0 millimeters and/or no of more than about 15.0 millimeters, or of at least about 4.0 millimeters and/or no of more than about 8.0 millimeters, or of about 5.0 millimeters, although curvatures outside of these ranges can be used. FIG. 8 is a bottom-up cross-sectional view of the lace guide 300 taken through a horizontal plane through a midpoint of the main channel 316. The curvature of the flanges of the end pieces 308, 310 in the plane shown in FIG. 8 can have a radius of curvature of at least about 3.0 millimeters and/or no of more than about 8.0 millimeters, or of about 4.0 millimeters, although curvatures outside these ranges can also be used. In some embodiments, the lace channel 302 can be generally U-shaped. The first opening 304 can face in a direction along axis D, where the axis D is a line passing through the center of the first opening 304 and extending in the direction of a tangent line to the curvature of the main channel 316 at the first opening, similar to the axis E described above. Thus, the lace 330 is directed out of the first opening 304 generally in the direction of the axis D, but the lace path of the lace 330 leaving the first opening 304 can vary from the direction of the axis D depending on the position toward which the lace 330 extends (e.g., toward a next lace guide) and/or depending on the curvature of the lace 330 through the main channel 316. The second opening 306 can face along an axis E, where axis E is similar to the axis D, a line passing through the center of the second opening 306 and extending in the direction of a tangent line to the curvature of the main channel 316 at the second opening 306, as described above. Thus, the lace 330 can be directed out of the second opening 306 generally in the direction of the axis E, but the lace path of the lace 330 leaving the second opening 306 can vary from the direction of the axis E depending on the position toward which the lace 330 extends (e.g., toward a next lace guide) and/or depending on the curvature of the lace 330 through the main channel 316. In the illustrated embodiment, the first opening 304 and the second opening 306 face in substantially the same direction such that the axis D and the axis E are substantially parallel to each other and/or to a central axis C of the lace guide 300. As can be seen in FIG. 2, for example, in some cases the lace can enter or exit the lace guide at an angle that is offset from the central axis C of the lace guide. Accordingly, in some embodiments, one or both of the openings 304, 306 can face in a direction that is offset from the central axis C of the lace guide 300 such that the lace 330 is directed out of one or both of the openings 304, 306 generally along the corresponding axes D, E at an angle with respect to the central axis C. In some embodiments, an angle formed between the axis D of the first opening 304 and the axis E of the second opening 306 can be no more than about 45°, or no more than about 30°, or no more than about 15°, or of no more than about 5°. As shown in the illustrated embodiment, in some cases, the openings 304, 306 can face in substantially the same direction. The lace guide 300 can be symmetrical such that each axes D and E are offset from the central axis C by about the same angle. The lace guide 300 can also be asymmetrical, such that the axis D of the first opening 304 is offset from the central axis C by a different angle than the axis E of the second opening 306. For example, the openings 304, 306 can be angled differently depending on their location on the article, such as near the ankle opening of a shoe. One or both of the axes D and E can be offset from the central axis C by an angle of no more than about 30°, or of no more than about 15°, or of no more than about 5°, or close to or equal to 0°, although angles outside of these ranges can also be used. FIG. 9 is a cross-sectional view of the lace guide 300 similar to that of FIG. 8, but showing a lace 330 fed through the lace channel. The lace guide 300 can be formed in various sizes. In the embodiment illustrated in FIG. 9, the lace guide 300 is a 15 millimeter lace guide in which the center of the first opening 304 and the center of the second opening 306 are about 15 millimeters apart. Because at least a portion of the lace channel 302 is disposed within the upper of the shoe, the depth 334 of the lace channel 302 can be greater than on a conventional, external lace guide. A deep external lace guide can appear bulky and cumbersome. Thus, generally, external lace guides have a relatively shallow depth that forces the lace to curve sharper than its natural curvature would allow. This can cause the lace to rub against the inside surface of the lace channel 302 with more force and/or at more locations than would be the case if a deeper lace guide were used that conformed to the natural curvature of the lace. In some embodiments, when the lace 330 is tightened past the threshold level of tension, the lace can be pulled against the front wall 305 of the main channel 316 such that the lace 330 contact the substantially the full length of the front wall 305 through the lace channel 302. In some embodiments, the lace 330 can have a tension that is above the threshold level when the lacing system is fully tightened during use, but the tension of the lace 330 can be below the threshold level during the tightening and loosening process, which is when relative large lengths of the lace 330 slide through the lace channel 302. Thus, in some embodiments, as the lace 330 slides through the lace channel 302 during the tightening and loosening process, the depth 334 of the lace channel 302 can allow the lace 330 to rub against the inside of the lace channel 302 with less force and/or at fewer locations than in a conventional, shallow lace guide. The threshold level of tension at which the lace 330 abuts against the front wall 305 of the lace channel 302 can depend on the thickness and materials used for the lace 330. For example, a more rigid lace can require more tension to bend than a relatively soft lace. The threshold level of curvature can also depend on the size and shape of the pathway through the lace channel 302. For example, more tension can be required to bend the lace to follow a path having a small radius of curvature. In one example embodiment, for a lace guide having a radius of curvature of 10 mm, and for a lace made of stranded stainless steel of 7×7 construction and having a lace diameter of 1 mm, a tension of about 0.5 to 1.0 pound on each lace end or more would cause the lace to abut against substantially the full length of the inside wall of the lace channel. In some embodiments, the threshold tension can be high enough and/or the desired tension can be low enough so that the lacing system can be tightened to a usable level without causing the lace 330 to abut against the length of the front wall 305 of the lace channel 302. In some embodiments, when the lace 330 is tight, the lace 330 can still side in the lace channel 302, for example, when the user shifts position in a shoe. As the lace 330 slides through the lace channel 302, the depth 334 of the lace channel 302 can allow the lace 330 to rub against the inside of the lace channel 302 with less force and/or at fewer locations than in a conventional, shallow lace guide. This reduced friction can provide a lacing system in which less force is necessary to move the lace through the lace guides, thereby allowing the tension to be more evenly distributed between the lace guides. Fewer contact points and less friction between the lace guides 300 and the lace 330 can result in less wear on the components. Also, less friction can allow for the tension in the lacing system to be more evenly distributed during the tightening process and during use of the article. When the article (e.g., shoe) flexes during use, less friction in the lacing system can facilitate movement of the lace 330 to redistribute the flex according to the contours of the article (e.g., shoe) during use. While in some conventional lacing systems with conventional eyelets, sharp turns and high friction can be desirable to facilitate tightening and tying of the laces at different progressive points along the closure system, in the lacing system 100, low friction lace guides can be used because the lace can be tightened from a single point or from two or more designated points. In conventional, relatively shallow, lace guides the lace generally contacts the inside of the lace channel at five points or more. In the lace guide 300, the lace 330 preferably contacts the lace channel 302 at no more than four points when under tension. The four contact points 332a-d are shown as dots in FIG. 9. Notably, the lace 330 does not contact the lace channel at or near the apex 336 thereof, as it would if the depth 334 of the lace channel 302 were reduced. In the illustrated embodiment, two of the contact points 332a, 332d are at or near the openings 304, 306, and two of the contact points 332b, 332c are deeper inside the lace channel 302, and can be, for example, about midway between the openings 304, 306 and the apex 336. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 9, at the apex 336, the lace 330 can be positioned close to the front wall 305 of the lace channel 302 that is nearest the openings 302, 306. For simplicity the four contact points 332a-d are shown positioned along a single plane at the cross section of FIG. 9. However, in some embodiments, the lace 330 can enter the lace channel 302 at an angle such that the points of contact 332a-d do not lie on a plane level with the lace channel 302. For example, in some embodiments, the contact points 332a and 332d an be lower in the main channel 316 (e.g., on or near a bottom surface of the main channel 316) than the contact points 332b and 332c (which can be on or near a top surface of the main channel 316). FIG. 10 is a cross-sectional view of a 20 millimeter lace guide 1000 in which the openings 1004 and 1006 are spaced apart by about 20 millimeters. A lace 1030 passes through the lace channel 1002 and contacts the lace channel 1002 at four contact points 1032a-d. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 10, the lace 1030 can be positioned near the back wall of the lace channel 1002 when at the apex 1036. FIG. 11 is a cross-sectional view of a 25 millimeter lace guide 1100 in which the openings 1104 and 1106 are spaced apart by about 25 millimeters. A lace 1130 passes through the lace channel 1102 and contacts the lace channel 1102 at four contact points 1132a-d. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 11, the lace 1130 can be spaced away from both the front and back walls of the lace channel 1102 when at the apex 1136. Many variations are possible. For example, lace guides of other sizes can be made (e.g., 30 millimeter lace guides, or lace guides of sizes between any of those discussed herein). The curvature of the lace channels 302, 1002, 1102 can be modified depending on the properties (e.g., materials and thickness) of the lace to be used. For example, a lace with a higher modulus of elasticity is more difficult to bend and stretch. The friction in the lacing system can be increased by using a lace with a higher modulus of elasticity or by turning the lace across tighter corners with a lower radius of curvature. The friction in the lacing system can be decreased by using a lace with a lower modulus of elasticity or by increasing the radius of curvature of the corners. Thus, to maintain a low friction, if a lace is changed to have a higher modulus of elasticity, the radius of curvature in the lace guides can be increased to compensate. In some embodiments, changing the properties of the lace or changing the curvature of the lace channels 301, 1002, 1102 can adjust the positions of the four contact points without adding a fifth contact point. As can be seen in FIG. 11, for example, the curvature of the main channel 1116 can be tighter (having a smaller radius of curvature) near the openings 1104, 1106 than near the apex 1136. In some embodiments, the curvature of the main channel 1116 can be substantially uniform or can be tighter near the apex 1136 than near the openings 1104, 1106. While in illustrated embodiment, the main channel 1116 has a substantially uniform width, in some embodiments the width of the main channel 1116 can vary. For example, the main channel 1116 can be wider near the apex than near the openings 1104, 1106, or vise versa. FIGS. 12A-F show steps of an example embodiment of a method for attaching the lace guide 300 to a shoe 340. At FIG. 12A, the lace guide 300 can be stitched to a reinforcement material 342 or tough stay. The stitching 344 can extend across the stitch flange 312. In some embodiments, the stitching 344 can pass over the lace channel 302 without any of the stitches passing through the lace channel 302. At FIG. 12B, the reinforcement material 342 can be attached to a liner 346 or inner material of the shoe 340 or other article using an adhesive or stitching or any other suitable attachment manner. Stitch flange 312 may provide additional strength to guide 300 to allow a softer material in the guide 300 while preventing the guide 300 from ripping from the article when placed under operational forced. The stitch flange 312 can simplify the stitching process by allowing a single linear stitch line 344 to be used to secure the guide 300, rather than stitching along the curved path formed by the lace channel 302. At FIG. 12C, an upper layer 348 is applied over the liner 346, reinforcement material 342, and lace guide 300. The upper layer can be stitched along one edge, and the stitching 350 can capture the upper layer 348, the reinforcement material 342, and the liner 346. As can be seen in FIG. 12C, the upper layer 348 can include two holes 352, 354. The first hole 352 can align with the first end piece 308, and the second hole 354 can align with the second end piece 310. At FIG. 12D, the end pieces 308, 310 are pushed through the corresponding holes 352, 354. In some embodiments, the material of the upper layer 348 can flex to allow the holes 352, 354 to widen when the end pieces are pushed through. In some embodiments, the holes 352, 354 can have a slit that allows the holes 352, 354 to open wide enough for the end pieces 308, 310 to pass through. In some cases, the slits can be stitched closed to prevent the end pieces 308, 310 from passing back through the holes 352, 354 or can be positioned under the external flange. The ridge or step 315 on the flange can prevent the flange from being pulled back through the corresponding hole. At FIG. 12E, the upper layer 348 can be secured to the lace guide 300, the reinforcement material 342, and/or to the liner 346. In some embodiments, an adhesive 356 can be applied under the upper layer 348 and the upper layer 348 can pressed down onto the lower layers. Stitching (not shown) or any other attachment method can be applied to secure the upper layer 348 to the lower layers. FIG. 12F shows the shoe 340 with the upper layer 348 secured over the lace channel 302 portion of the lace guide with the end pieces 308, 310 exposed through the holes 352, 354 in the upper layer. Many variations are possible. For example, the reinforcement material 342 and/or the liner 346 can be omitted. In some embodiments, the lace guide 300 can be secured directly to a structure of the shoe 340. In some embodiments, the lace guide 300 can be positioned in a recess (not shown) in the shoe 340 that is configured to receive the lace guide 300 such that the lace guide is substantially flush with the surrounding surfaces, thereby reducing or eliminating the bulge which can be produced by the cover portion of the lace guide 300. FIG. 13 is a front-top perspective view of a single-end-piece lace guide 1300. Much of the disclosure that relates to the double-end-piece lace guides (e.g., 300) also applies to the lace guide 1300. The single-end-piece lace guide 1300 can have a lace channel 1302 with a first opening 1304 and a second opening 1306 at the opposite end thereof. A supplemental lace channel (not shown), e.g., formed by a tubing, can be attached to the second opening 1306 in some embodiments, and in some cases can be inserted into the lace channel 1302. An end piece 1308 can be positioned at or near the opening 1304. The end piece 1308 can be similar to, or the same as, the end piece 308 described above. A stitch flange 1312 can extend from either side of the lace channel 1302. In some embodiments, a hole 1309 can be positioned on the top surface of the lace channel 302 at a location that is near the top flange portion 1326 of the end piece 1308. This hole 1309 can allow a tubing which is inserted to be viewable to assure that it is all the way seated into the guide. FIG. 14 is a split view of the lace guide 1300 slip along a horizontal plane that intersects the main channel 1316 at its midpoint. In some embodiments, the main channel 1316 does not have an open bottom because an insertion piece can be removed, for example, via the hole 1306 after the molding process. In some embodiments, one or more ridges 1360 can extend from near the opening 1304 toward the other opening 1306, and can end at about the midpoint between the first and second openings 1304, 1306. These ridges 1360 may be present to more easily allow a press fit to be achieved to the inserted tubing to reliably hold the tubing in place. In some embodiments, the main channel 1316 can include four ridges 1360a-d, as can be seen, for example, in the cross-sectional views of FIGS. 15 and 16. While discussed in terms of certain embodiments, it should be appreciated that the disclosure is not so limited. The embodiments are explained herein by way of example, and there are numerous modifications, variations and other embodiments that may be employed that would still be within the scope of the present invention. Components can be added, removed, and/or rearranged both within certain embodiments and between embodiments. Additionally, processing steps may be added, removed, or reordered. A wide variety of designs and approaches are possible. Where numerical values and/or ranges are disclosed, other numerical values can also be used. For example, some embodiments can use numerical values that are outside the disclosed ranges.
