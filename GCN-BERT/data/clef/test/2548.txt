Aesthetics are known to play an important role in consumer choice and use of dentifrice. A unique visual appearance for a dentifrice provides an aesthetic effect that the user finds pleasing and promotes the use of the dentifrice. In some cases, visual effects such as stripes or particles have been used to distinguish and market new dentifrice products, But there remains a continuous need for new and attractive visual variations for dentifrices. The present invention meets this need by providing a multiphase dentifrice comprising at least two visually distinct phases. The visually distinct phases of this invention can be packaged to appear in many different patterns, shapes, and designs, resulting in appealing new visuals for dentifrice. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a multi-phase dentifrice composition comprising at least two visually distinct phases, wherein said visually distinct phases are packaged in a generally transparent container, wherein at least one phase is in physical contact with another phase, and wherein the visually distinct phases form the appearance of at least one character. BRIEF DF.SCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a drawing of a dentifrice with at least two visually distinct phases packaged in a generally transparent container, wherein the phases form the appearance of at least one character, specifically the letters that spell the word "Crest".

Embodiments The present invention is directed to a multi-phase dentifrice composition comprising at least two visually distinct phases, wherein said visually distinct phases are packaged in a generally transparent container, at least one phase is in physical contact with another phase, and the phases form a unique visual appearance. It is understood that the visual appearances described herein are of the composition as it is in the container. That is, the descriptions depict the conthined appearance of the composition, the container, and any further packaging layer, not just the composition alone or of the composition as dispensed from the container. In some entbodimeats, the visually distinct phases form any of a variety of patterns, excepting stripes. The patterns that may be formed include, but are not limited to, swirls, spirals, marbled, geometric, petals, starburst, lightning, blocks, and combinations thereof. Patterns may appear two dimensional or three-dimensional, depending on whether the phases are opaque or transparent; as long as at least one phase is generally transparent, the pattern appears tha'eedimensionah Some embodiments may have more than one pattern. In other embodiment,s, the visually distinct phases may form the appearance of at least one character, where the characters include, but are not lippted to, letters, numerals, symbols, emblems, figures, signs, images, marks, logos, trademarks, depictions, shapes, monograms, and combinations thereof In some embodiments, at least one visually distinct phase may form a coil through at least one other visually distinct phase. In some embodiments, particularly embodiments that appear three-dimensional, there is a primary pattern and a secondary pattern. The primary pattern may be a coil, while the secondary pattern may be the shape or texture of the coil itself. In any coil embodiment, a coil may be continuous. As used herein, "continuous" means that the phase is literally connected from one end of the container to the other. But a coil, either continuous or discontinuous, may not necessarily appear connected, and it may not necessarily appear centered. Such a coil may be uniform, meaning that it is regularly spaced, or it may be non-uniform, meaning irregularly spaced. A coil may be at an angle within the container, or it may be along the container's longitudinal axis. A coil may touch the container or may be entirely enclosed within another phase or phases. A coil nmy be compacted or compressed, or it may be stretched out. As the degree of compression, i.e., the slope or pitch of the coil, varies, the coil's appearance is affected. For example, if compacted, a coil may overlap itself and appear rippled or mounded, as if it was loosely piled as it continuously fell. An overlapping coil may appear like a coiled rope, piles, or as seaweed. An overlapping coil may appear like a compacted spring, or appear interwoven. Though in some embodiments, one continuous phase may not actually be a coil, but may still overlap itself and apI ear rippled or mounded like seaweed or a coiled rope. Alternatively, a compacted coil may look like petals or leaves that are layered, stacked, or piled. A compacted coil may also appear as alternating flaps that are draped, nested, or interlaced with one another. As a coil is less compacted, or stretched out, it may appear more like a helix and be more uniform. The secondary pattern may reflect the shape or texture of a coil itself. A coil may be cupped, concave, or convex, having a scooped-out appearance. A coil may appear braided, checked, or interwoven, or it may appear tapered. Alternatively, a coil may appear textured or pleated. The variables of the secondary pattern may be independent from the variables of the primary pattern. That is, the shape and texture of the coil may not necessarily be affected by the degree of compression or the uniformity of the coil within another phase or phases. For all the embodiments described where a phase forms a coil through another phase, there may be more than one coil appearing through one or more other phases. In some embodiments, there may be more than one coil formed by a single visually distinct phase that appear through one or more other phase. In some coil embodiments, the container may be noncylindrical. In some coil embodiments, the total volume of all coil phases may be more than about 10% of the volume of all phases combined. In other coil embodiments, the total volume of all coil phases may be more than about 12% of the volume of all phases combined. In other coil embodiments, the total volume of all coil phases may be more than about 15% of the volume of all phases combined, In other coil embodiments, the total volume of all coil phases may be moie than about 20% of the volume of all phases combined. In still other coil embodiments, the total volume of all coil phases may be more than about 30% of the volume of all phases combined. In some coil embodiments, all phases may be coils, that is, the total volume of all coil phases is the volume of all phases combined. In some embodiments in which all phases are coils, all the coils may intertwine throughout the container. In some embodiments, each intertwining coil may have a constant thickness and all intertwining coils may have about the same thickness. In other embedilnents, the thickness of the coils may vary from each other, or the thickness of any particular coil may vary throughout. In other embodiments, the thickness of one intertwining coil may be at least two times the thickness of another intertwining coil, In some embodiments, the intertwining coils may have an irregular interface. As with the pattern embodiments, coil embodiments may appear two-dimensional or three-dimensional, depending on whether the phases are opaque or transparent; as long as at least one phase is generally transparent, the composition's appearance is three-dimensional. When all die phases are opaque, the product's appearance may still be described as a coil through another phase or phases, or as intertwining coils. There may be a secondary pattern reflecting the shape or texture of the coil itself, at least one coil nmy overlap itself, or the container may be noncylindrical. In some all-opaque embodiments, the total volume of all coil phases may be more than 10% of the volume of all phases combined. But one opaque phase forming a coil through another opaque phase or phases may also be described in two dimensions. For example, some embodiments may resemble the appearance of a candy cane or a barber's pole, Alternatively, in the embodiments where all phases are opaque, the visually distinct phases may appear and may be described not only as patterns or coils, but also as bands. In this context, a hand is understood to be a continuous stroke of one phase that can be straight or nonstraight and that can vary in width throughout. For example, in some embodiments where all phases are opaque, the visually distinct phases lorm alternating bands wheie at least one band is oriented in a direction not parallel to the longitudinal axis of the container. In other embodiments where all phases are opaque, the visually distinct phases form alternating bands where at least one band is oriented in a direction not parallel to the direction that the composition is dispensed from the container. Embodiments in which at least one phase is generally transparent may also be described as alternating bands, wherein at least one band is oriented in a direction not parallel to the longitudinal axis of the container or in a direction not parallel to the direction that the composition is dispensed from the container. In any embodiment described as having alternating bands, the alternating bands may be non-intersecting or there may be at least one bend that intersects with an adjacent band. In sonte alternating band embodiments, any two adjacent bands may be generally parallel. In other embodiments, each band may have a constant thickness while all bands have about the same thickness. In other embodiments, the thickness of the bands of one visually distinct phase may be at least two times the thickness of the bands of another visually distinct phase. In still other embodiments with alternating bands, the alternating bands may have an inegular interface, For example, the interface may be jagged or some other nonlinear alignment. In other embodiments, the bands of one phase may appear patterned, such as being textured, pleated, cupped, concave, convex, braided, or tapered. And for any embodiment with alternating bands, the container may be non-cylindrical. In still other embodiments of the present invention, the conthination of the dentifrice composition plus the container may create the appearance of a pattern. In other embodiments, the combination of the dentifrice composition, the container, and at least one packaging layer may forn a panes. A packaging layer is any furrber bundling or wrapping of the dentifrice composition beyond die container, including but not limited to a label, shrink wrap, stretch wrap, or a box. In still other embodiments, the conthination of the dentifrice composition and at least one packaging layer may create the appearance of a pattern. In any embodiment in which the container and/or a packaging layer help form the unique appearance, the dentifrice composition may be multi-phased where each phase is visually distinct, or the dentifrice composition may be a single phase. In the embodiments in which the container and/or packaging layer help form a pattern, the patterns that may be formed include but are not limited to stripes, trmrbled, spiral, geometric, starburst, lightning, blocks, and combinations thereof. In embodiments in which the container and/or packaging layer help form a pattern, the container or packaging layer appearance may be striped, colored, tinted, shaded, frosted, or patterned. In any embodiment of the dentifrice composition, at least one visually distinct phase nuiy comprise a benefit phase. In some embodiments, the visually distinct phases may appear to be randomly oriented, For any particular embodiment described above, additional factors may create varied appearances. A particular embodiment, i.e., those with characters, or a described pattern, coil, or band formation, may encompass numerous appearances due to additional factors that include, but are not limited to, the appearance of a phase, container or packaging layer effects, the filling procedure, the motion or motions of a filling nozzle or nozzles, motion of the container while filling, effects achieved after filling, or the orientation of the product in the container. For example, the appearance of a phase may be varied by its color, its width or thickness as a coil or band, transparency vs. opacity, peadescence, texture, photosensitivity, or by suspended particles in the phase. The appearance of a phase may be patterned, such as being pleated, cupped, concave, convex, braided, tapered, or textured. In any embodiment, each visually distinct phase may comprise at least about 10% of the volume of all phases combined. Container or packaging layer effects that may also create varied appearances of a particular embodiment include, but are not limited to, colors, shades, tints, frosting, patterns, stripes, transparency, translucency, shapes, holography, labels, shrink wrap, stretch wrap, optical illusions, Iogos, characters, and particles. Another container effect may be a strip down the center of the container, which may or may not contact the dentifrice composition. Such a strip may have printing or a design on it. Still another container el/Ect may be printing on the inside of the container in soluble ink that interacts with the dentifrice composition. Any of these container and/or packaging layer effects may create any of the visual appearances described herein. The visually distinct phases may be packaged in a generally transparent container. In one aspect, at least 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60 %, 70%, 80%, 90%, or even 100% of the container's surface area may be generally transparent. Materials from which said generally transparent portion may be made include, but are not limited to: polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polycarbonate (PC), polyamides (PA), polyethylene terephthalate (PETE), polyvinylchloride (PVC), general purpose polystyrene (GPPS), and polystyrene (PS). The generally transparent portion of said container may have a transmittance of more than 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% or even more than 70% in the visible part of the spectrum (approx. 410-800 nm). For purposes of the invention, as long as one wavelength in the visible light range has greater than 25% transmittance, it is considered to be generally transparent. A portion of the container or the entire container may be tinted, shaded, colored, frosted, patterned, or striped. Such container appearances may be achieved, for example, by including colorant in the resin during manufacture of the container. The appearances may also be attained by adding decorations to a finished container, or by printing on, embossing, or stamping an already-manufactured container. Shrink-wrapping or streteh-wrapping the container or portion of the container may also create the described appearances for the container. In addition, any combination of the described methods could be used to create various container appearances. Unique visual appearances may be created by the visually distinct phases alone, by the container, or by a combination of the visually distinct phases and the container. The pattern created by the visually distinct phases, the container, or a combination of the visually distinct phases and the container may be laser-activated, meaning that a photosensitive substance is included in at least one of the visually distinct phases or the container and then targeted with a laser to produce a discrete pattern. The container of the present invention may be of any form, shape, or size suitable for storing and packaging dentifrice. Examples of forms include tubes, bottles, tottles, thermoforms, or pouches. The shape of the container may be, for example, cylindrical, which is defined as a tube with a consistent cross-sectionni area and two equally-sized circles on either end. Any container shape that does not have two equally-sized circles on the ends is non-cylindrical. For example, the container may be oval-shaped at the ends, wherein the two ovals may be the same size or different sizes, and the body of the container has a generally oval-shaped cross-section at all points. The shape of the container may affect the visual appearance of the phases, for example, by affecting the colors or by creating the appearance of layers. The size of the container may range from a single dose up to 30 oz. (860 grams), preferably up to 20 oz. (570 grants), and more preferably up to 14 oz, (400 grams). Ways that the phases may be dispensed from the container include, for example, squeezing the container, by a pump mechanism, or by gravity. The container that the visually distinct phases are packaged in may have a label adhered to it. The label may be transparent, generally transparent, or opaque. The label may be colored, shaded, tinted, patterned, or striped. The label may be in any shape, including simple shapes such as bands, squares, rectangles, rectangles with round corners, circles, or ovals, or more complicated shapes, for example, shapes such as letters. The label may cover up to 100% of the container. The label may contain maltiple pages. The label may be printed inside out so as to be read through a transparent product. All or part of the label may be shrink-wrapped or stretchwrapped onto the container. Labeling of the container may be etched into the mold of the container or embossed on the container, and, in some embodiments, then printed on. Unique visual appearances may be created by the visually distinct phases alone, by the label appearance, or by a combination of the visually distinct phases and the label. Any packaging layer, such as shrink wrap, stretch wrap, or a box, for the dentifrice composition may be patterned, colored, shaded, tinted, or striped. The filling procedure of the phases into the container may be done continuously at a steady rate, done continuously at varying rates, or may be done discontinuously with random stops and starts or with regular, or cyclic, stops and starts. Motions of the nozzle, nozzles, or the container while filling include, but are not lintited to, oscillating, reciprocating, translating, vibrating, pulsating, rotating, and plunging. Effects achieved after filling include, but are not limited to, centrifuging, shaking, changing temperature, changing pressure, adding or removing air, using electromagnetic radiation, and using sonic energy. Multiple filling nozzles may be used to achieve the described visual appearances. Nozzle diameters may range from 1/16 inch (1.5875 mm) up to the siT of the opening of the container, but preferably range from inch to 1 inch (6.35 mm to 25.4 nun). The arrangement of filling nozzles may be concentric or side-by-side. Concentric nozzles may he flush or protruding. Achieving the visual appearances described herein may be accomplished with modifications to standard, high-viscosity filling equipment, for example tube fillers from IWK or Nordeta or with other fill systems, such as nlodifications to standard liquids fillers, for example with fillers sold by Pneumatic Scale, Krones, or Ronchi. The dosing process for the desired appearance is achieved through controlled dosing through a filling nozzle of each phase of the dentifrice, for example with a stepper motor, servo motor, mass flow meter, magnetic flow meter, or metering pump. The dosing of each phase may be coordinawA through mechanical or electrical synchronization of the flows. Different phases may be injected into the filling nozzle through nozzle segmentation, such as on standard multicolor striping dentifrice machines from IWK or Norden, or with secondary flows injected at various locations in the filling nozzle. 'lhe container being filled may be cylindrical, for example a standard dentifrice tube, or a different shape such as a bottle, which may be designed 1o stand or rest on its base or its closure. Filling of the container may involve relative motion between the container and the filling nozzle, suitably accomplished by moving the container while holding the nozzle fixed, by moving the nozzle while holding the container fixed, or by moving both the filling nozzle and the container simultaneously. The relative motion of the filling nozzle and container may involve any controlled combination of rotational, vertical, horizontal, or orbital-oscillating or non-oscillating motion. This motion would suitably be accomplished by mechanical or electrical synchronization of the dosing and relative motions through devices such as mechanical line-shafts and cams, or electrical stepper or servo motors. A filling nozzle suitable for filling the visually distinct phases into a container is described in WO 2006/125663, which is incorporated by reference herein. Such a filling nozzle comprises a tubular body having an internal tubular primary conduit for flow of a primary phase, bounded by a peripheral wall, adapted for the introduction of a primary phase at an upstream position of the conduit, having a downstream end adapted to be inserted into a container to be filled, an outlet opening at a downstream end of the conduit via which a phase may flow from the conduit into a container, within the conduit at least one secondary conduit for the flow of a secondary phase, adapted for the introduction of the secondary phase at an upstream part of the secondary conduit, the secondary conduit having at least one outlet nozzle adjacent a downstream end of the secondary conduit configured to introduce a stream of the secondary phase into a flow of the primary phase in the primary componem. To complete the filling of the visually distinct phases into a container, an apparatus may be used, as further described in WO 2006/125663, comprising the filling nozzle described above, a support for the container, means to move the support and filling nozzle relatively toward each other so that the downstream end of the f'filing nozzle may be inserted into the container, means to introduce primary and secondary phases into the respective primary and secondary conduits such that the phases flow out of the outlet opening of the filling nozzle relatively apart as the visually distinct phases flow into the container, and means to cause relative rotation of the filling nozzle and container about the upstream-downstream axis as the filling nozzle and container move relatively apart. A process for filling a container with visually distinct phase comprises the steps of providing an apparatus as described above, providing a container, moving the container and filling nozzle relatively toward each other so that the downstream end of the filling nozzle becomes inserted into the container, introduaing primary and secondary phases into the respective primary and secondary conduits such that the phases flow out of the outlet opening of the filling nozzle into the container, moving the container and filling nozzle relatively apart as the phase flows into the container, and relatively rotating the filling nozzle and container about the upstream-downstream axis as the filling nozzle and container move relatively apart, to thereby form a number of unique appearances, Alternatively, various filling nozzle assemblies and filling apparatuses are described in US 6,516,838, US 6,245,344, US 6,367,519, and US 6,213,166, which are incorporated by reference herein. The visually distinct phases may be filled into a container by a filling apparatus comprising a nozzle assembly having at least two nozzles coupled together in close configuration, at least two pumps for pumping each of the phases stored in separate storage bins each interconnected by a suction hose to each pump, at least two hoses interconnected to the nozzles and the pumps, a support and alignment funnel coupled to the apparatus for supporting the container to be filled in an upright position, a drive motor coupled to the nozzle assembly adapted to rotate the nozzle assemble and move the nozzle assembly in a vertical direction during filling of the container, and a base located adjacent to the support and alignment funnel. One process for filling a container with visually distinct phases comprises the steps of providing at least two visually distinct phases, arranged in separate storage bins each having a pump and a hose attached thereto, moving a container for receiving a resulting product formed by the at least two visually distinct phases into position relative to a support and alignment funnel, pumping the at least two visually distinct phases through the respective hoses into a nozzle assembly having at least two nozzles for filling the container, rotating the nozzle assembly, and combining predetermined amounts of each of the at least two visually distinct phases for creating the resulting product housed in a single container, wherein the resulting product has the at least two visually distinct phases form a unique appearance. Another process for filling a container with the visually distinct phases conlprises the steps of providing a filling apparatus as described above, mounting the container on the base, signaling a commencement step from the filling apparatus, placing the nozzle assembly directly over the container and the support and alignment funnel, dropping the nozzle assembly into the container whereby the tip of the nozzles are proximate to a bottom portion of the container, providing relative rotational movement between the nozzle and the container at a predetermined number of revolutions per minute, starting the at least two pumps, providing relative vertical movement causing increased separation between the nozzle assembly and a bottom of the container, controlling a rate of flow of each of the phases by the pumps, and urging the phases through the respective hoses to fill the container. Dentifrice Compositions The dentifrice compositions of the present invention may be typical dentifrice formulations. Each of the multi-phases may be a separate composition or may be generally the same except lbr sontething that makes it visually distinguishable. The material that changes the visual appearance of a phase may be added at the very end of production so that the two or more compositions can be formed in one batch and then differentiated at the last point in the process before or as filling occurs. The material added to distinguish a phase may he a colorant, dye, titanitml dioxide, opacifying agent, brightening agent, pearlescent, photosensitive material, or a type of particle, The actual material added may be visible itself or it may cause an effect that is visible in the final composition. A material itself may be the separate phase. For exanlple, during filling, a layer of sparkles may be added that is visible. This would create a visually distinct phase. Each of the visually distinct phases may have the same viscosity or different viscosities. Dentifrice compositions are well known.
