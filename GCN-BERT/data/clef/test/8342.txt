Technical Field This invention belongs to the technical area of personal or household products and is related to the double purpose bag which can be used as a messenger bag (or shoulder bag) carried on the shoulder or as a backpack, and the method of its transformation. Background Art Double purpose bags which are used as messenger bags or backpacks are basically produced on the basis of the idea that a person would have the possibility to choose the most convenient way of carrying such bag in accordance with the needs in specific life situation. For example, if you ride a bicycle or go by public transport, or have to carry heavier load it will be more convenient to use this bag as a backpack, but if you go to a business meeting this bag could be transformed to a messenger bag carried on the shoulder. Known double purpose bags vary by their different construction, forms, and the methods of transformation from the messenger bag type to the backpack type, and vice versa. Double purpose bags contain most often refixable or remakeable straps and additional equipment by way of which the messenger bag is transformed to the backpack type, and vice versa. The goal of this invention is the universal construction of this double purpose bag and the method of its transformation which would be quick and simple, to be used by people of different age groups, the bag which would contain only one continuous lengthwise strap, would not require detachment of the strap or reattachment of the strap to other places, would not require use of additional equipment, and, with transformation of the bag, its content would remain in stable condition (in geometrical sense) and would not tumble over. The patent No. US6138881 published on 31 October 2000 contains description of the double purpose ergonomic bag which can be easily transformed from the backpack type to the messenger bag type, and vice versa. Upper part of this bag's strap is joined with the bag and contains two eyelets one of which is fixed to the upper part of this bag's strap, and another to the upper part of the bag. The said eyelets are mutually joined by means of the whirligig. Lower part of the strap is connected by two detachable clips to the eyelets fixed to the lower part of the backside of the bag. A zipper is inserted in the middle of the strap, starting from the upper part of this bag's strap till the lower part of the strap, by opening of which the strap is divided into two narrower straps in order the messenger bag could be used as a backpack. In order to complete the transformation it is necessary additionally to detach both clips from the eyelet located in the middle of the lower part of the backside of the bag, and attach them to the eyelets located at the right and left sides of the backside of the bag. Opening of the zipper allows splitting of one broad strap which is used to carry a bag on the shoulder to two narrower straps in order the messenger bag could be used as a backpack. Such type of the messenger bag is not convenient because, first of all, in order to make transformation of the bag it is necessary to turn the bag by the 90ยบ angle which could cause tumbling over of the things contained in the bag. Secondly, additional component, i.e. zipper, is required which could fail to function after certain period of time, resulting in loss of the transformation function of the messenger bag. Thirdly, in order to make transformation of the bag it is necessary additionally to detach the clips fixed at the lower part of the strap and to reattach them to other eyelets located in the middle of the lower part of the backside of the bag, such operation being inefficient and inconvenient one. The application No. WO9927815 published on 10 June of 1999 contains description of the triple purpose bag which can be used as a messenger bag carried on the shoulder, usual handbag carried by hand, or backpack. The ends of this bag's straps are fixed firmly to the inside rather than outside surface of the bag, and are pulled out of the bag or pushed back into the bag through the cutouts made on the bag's sides. Besides, in order to use the bag as a backpack it is necessary to pull out the part of the bag which is pushed together, which contains two straps inserted through two cutouts located at its upper part, and to insert back these two straps into the bag through two cutouts located at its right and left side. First of all, requirement to pull out and push back a part of the bag which is pushed together in order to make transformation of the bag, causes inconveniences using the bag. Secondly, the cutouts located at the bag's sides through which the straps are pulled out will become the method of penetration of water into the bag when it is raining or snowing outside, and this water can ruin the things contained in the bag. Thirdly, in order to make transformation of the bag it is necessary to turn the bag by the 90ยบ angle which could cause tumbling over of the things contained inside the bag. Fourthly, after transformation of the backpack to the messenger bag or usual bag one strap is left unused, and it should be concealed inside the bag in order it would not hang out at the outside of the bag. The patent No. CN202919284 published on 8 May 2013 contains description of the triple purpose bag which can be used as a messenger bag carried on the shoulder, usual handbag carried by hand, or backpack. When this bag is used as a backpack it contains a zipper in the form of arc inserted in the upper part of the backpack, which starts and ends in the middle of the backpack's sides. By completely unzipping the zipper, unzipped parts of the backpack are unbended and folded to the inside of the bag, and the backpack is transformed to the usual handbag carried by hand or messenger bag carried on the shoulder. Such transformation of the bag is not convenient, since it is necessary to detach and reattach the straps, and to fold certain part of the bag and place it inside the bag which reduces useful space of the transformed bag. The application No. US20130233901 published on 12 September 2013 contains description of the bag which can be easily transformed from a messenger bag carried on the shoulder or usual handbag carried by hand to a backpack, and vice versa. In order to transform such bag it is not required to detach unnecessary straps and attach additional straps, to change the place of fastening of the straps, and after transformation of a bag from the backpack type to the messenger bag type no unused straps are left. However, transformation of the strap of such bag is inconvenient, since a part of the strap used as a handle to carry usual bag, will contact a nape of the neck of a person carrying such bag transformed to the backpack and can cause physical discomfort. The application No. US2013292441 published on 7 November 2013 contains description of the method of transformation of a backpack to a messenger bag and vice versa, closest to its technical level when it is not required to attach additional straps and/or to reattach the straps to other places. Such way of transformation of the bag requires that the loops for fastening the straps should be fixed at the right and left sides of the bag, and the ends of the straps should be equipped with the fixtures to be attached to the loops located at one side of the bag. However, such way of transformation of the bag is inconvenient, since it is necessary to turn the bag by the 90ยบ angle which could cause tumbling over of the things contained inside the bag. Technical Problem Technical Solution The main advantage of this invention is that both ends of a single strap of the bag are fixed to the sliders located at the right and left sides of the lower part of the backside of the bag, and the strap is pulled upwards or to both sides holding by its middle part or by its edges through the loops located at the right and left sides of the upper part of the backside of the bag, in such way transforming the bag easily and quickly from the backpack to the messenger bag, and vice versa. During transformation the messenger bag is not turned over, its strap is not detached and reattached to other places, and no additional fixtures are used.
