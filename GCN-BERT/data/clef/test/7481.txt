Example 66A
3-Isobutyl-5-methyl-1-(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione
3.23 g (23.39 mmol) of potassium carbonate were added to a solution of 2.23 g (9.35 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 44A in 82.6 ml of DMF, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 15 min. Then 6.48 g (28.07 mmol) of 1,1,1-trifluoro-3-iodopropane were added, and the mixture was stirred at RT for 73 h. The DMF was then very substantially distilled off and the remaining residue was partitioned between semisaturated sodium chloride solution (200 ml) and ethyl acetate (100 ml). The aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The residue obtained was chromatographed using a silica gel cartridge (Biotage, 340 g of silica gel, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate). In this way, 2.67 g (84% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
