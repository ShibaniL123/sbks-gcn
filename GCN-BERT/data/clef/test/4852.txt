WIRELESS IMPLANTABLE POWER RECEIVER SYSTEM AND METHODS CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of and priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/786,069, which was filed on March 14, 2013. The foregoing U.S. provisional application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. BACKGROUND [0002] Various devices are used within the body for a multitude of therapeutic applications. For instance, devices may be used to deliver stimulatory signals, record vital signs, perform pacing or defibrillation operations, record action potential activity from targeted tissue, control drug release from time-release capsules or drug pump units, or interface with the auditory system to assist with hearing. Typically, a subcutaneous battery operated implantable pulse generator (IPG) or other charge storage mechanism is used to provide power to a device. [0003] However, devices which utilize a battery or other charge storage component are no longer functional once the battery or charge storage component can no longer retain charge. Consequently, for an implanted device, a patient would need to undergo a subsequent surgical procedure to obtain a replacement device. In addition, rechargeable IPGs cannot typically administer therapy while the unit is being recharged. [0004] By utilizing the technology incorporated within the implantable wireless power receiver, which does not rely upon a battery or other charge storage device for operation, the life of an implanted device is no longer limited by the life of the battery or the ability to store charge. Further, such technology facilitates a smaller form factor, which results in a less invasive surgical procedure for placement of the device, and helps to reduce scarring from a reduction in the amount of bodily tissue in contact with the implanted device. SUMMARY [0005] One embodiment of the present disclosure relates to a wireless implantable power receiver for use with a medical stimulation or monitoring device.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0023] The systems, methods and apparatus described in this application relate to transmitting and modulating energy and signals into and through a wireless power receiver that is fully contained within the body of an implantable device. The wireless implantable power receiver can include one or more non-inductive antennas for receiving wireless or radiated energy from a remote source. The wireless implantable power receiver can also include one or more electronic circuits for harnessing the wireless energy and transforming such energy into a power source that is routed to the other elements of the device that provide therapeutic function or monitoring. The wireless implantable power receiver (herein referred to as “receiver”) may be used to power medical devices (e.g., implantable medical stimulation and/or monitoring devices, devices which include neurostimulation functions, pacing, identification, telemetry, sensing or other body monitoring functions, etc.). [0024] Embodiments of the present invention include a system for providing power In a form factor that can be fully contained within a device, along with parameter information embedding on an analog waveform(s) when applicable. Such a system may further be easily placed within tissue or reside within dose contact to the targeted tissue. Additionally, such a system can reside at a location in which electrical signals from electrical radiative coupling is adequately received by the system at various tissue depths. Such a system is preferably wireless, and does not use cables or inductive coupling to power the implantable power receiver. Such a system may not use, contain, or rely on wired connectors or connector pads (e.g., a providing a physical electrical connection, providing close inductive coupling, etc.). [0025] One embodiment relates to a wireless implantable power receiver including one or more non-inductive antennas and electronic circuitry. The one or more non-inductive antennas are configured to receive radiated energy. The electronic circuitry is configured to convert the radiated energy received by the one or more non-inductive antennas to a DC power supply to provide power to the device. The medical device can exclude a connector for receiving a wire or for receiving power from a source other than the DC power supply. In some embodiments, the power supplied by the DC power supply based on the radiated energy received is sufficient to power the medical device without supplemental power. In an exemplary embodiment, the medical device does not include a long term battery for energy storage but rather uses the “live” receipt of energy at the antenna to power the circuitry and to power the medical device’s primary function. [0026] in some embodiments, the wireless implantable power receiver is not connected indirectly via a length of thin wire to a lead containing electrodes for stimulation of tissues associated with the spinal column, but, Instead, is fully integrated into an overall system in which the wireless implantable power receiver provides power directly to a component or device, which is itself implantable. A wireless implantable power receiver can attach directly to a component or device (e.g., medical device) that is in need of a DC power supply. In other embodiments, the receiver may provide power to a plurality of sensors distributed throughout a device, in still other embodiments, a plurality of receivers are arranged in series, with respect to one another, to produce a power supply that is greater than 10 Volts DC power. [0027] Another embodiment relates to a wireless implantable power receiver including one or more non-inductive antennas configured to receive radiated energy. The receiver can also include electronic circuitry configured to convert the radiated energy received by the one or more non-inductive antennas into: (i) a DC power supply to provide power to one or more devices; (ii) a signal to provide parameter settings to the device; (iii) a waveform to provide stimulatory signals to a tissue; or (iv) any combination thereof. The receiver can exclude a wired connector for receiving the power. [0028] A wireless implantable power receiver includes one or more non-inductive antennas and electronic circuitry, in which the one or more non-inductive antennas are configured to receive radiated energy, and the electronic circuitry is configured to convert the radiated energy received by the one or more non-inductive antennas to a DC power supply to provide power to one or more devices, wherein the device excludes one or more electrodes configured to apply one or more electrical pulses to a neural tissue associated with the spinal column. [0029] Accordingly, the present invention provides a wireless implantable power receiver system. The system includes an enclosure, the enclosure housing, and one or more non-inductive antenna(s) configured to receive, from a remote antenna through electrical radiative coupling, an input signal containing electrical energy. The system further includes one or more circuits electrically connected to the one or more non-inductive antenna(s), configured to convert the electrical energy contained in an input signal to a DC constant power source. The enclosure, in certain embodiments, is shaped and arranged for delivery into a subject’s body through an introducer or needle. In another embodiment, a relay antenna which is physically separate from the remote antenna is used to transmit energy to the implantable power receiver. In still another embodiment, the implantable power receiver may additionally deliver parameters to a device, or waveforms to tissue, or both. Distinctively, the Invention disclosed here does not connect to a separate device as detailed in provisional U.S. patent application, 61/733,867, which utilizes a connector to provide power only to an attached device. Embodiments of the present invention can provide, not only power, but also parameter sets and instructions to circuitry (e.g., circuitry of the medical stimulation or monitoring device). The receiver circuitry and the medical device circuitry can be contained within the same housing or enclosure, according to an exemplary embodiment. [0030] Further descriptions of exemplary wireless systems for providing neural stimulation to a patient can be found in co-pending published PCT applications PCT/US2012/23029 filed January 28, 2011, PCT7US2012/32200 filed April 11, 2011, PCT/US2012/48903, filed January 28, 2011, PCT/US2012/50633, filed August 12, 2011 and PCT/US2012/55748, filed September 15, 2011, the complete disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes, [0031] In still another embodiment of the invention, one or more circuits of the implantable power receiver, preferably, include only passive components, in another embodiment, the rectification circuitry and the smoothing circuitry are passive. In yet other embodiments, the one or more circuits are active (e.g., an active integrated circuit, field programmable gate array, or another active controller that can be powered for a brief period of time and conduct its task using power provided by the receiver circuitry). [0032] In yet another embodiment of the invention, the implantable power receiver, preferably, does not include connectors (e.g., wired connectors) or connector pads (e.g., inductive pads), differentiating the device from the prior art. In still further embodiments, the implantable power receiver does not include a built-in long term storage battery. In still further embodiments, neither the receiver nor the medical device powered by the receiver contains a long term storage battery. In still further embodiments, the receiver and/or the medical device contain a battery used for backup purposes or other secondary purposes while the primary power is provided via the receiver circuitry. [0033] Internal circuitry of the implanted wireless receiver system functions to provide power to the device electronics within the enclosure and to convert the incoming wireless energy signal (e.g. radiated energy) into an electrical waveform, or to distribute to portions of the device. [0034] In one embodiment, the internal circuitry may include one or a plurality of diodes. It should be noted that diodes function to rectify the wireless signal, such as a sinusoidal signal, received by the non-inductive antenna(s). The diodes have a low threshold voltage to maximize the energy used for creating waveforms and power. Additionally, the circuitry may include a charge balancing microelectronic component to reduce or prevent corrosion as well as a current limiter. [0035] !n certain embodiments, the circuitry may include one or more non-inductive antennas, a rectifier, a charge balancer, a current limiter, a controller, and a device interface. In brief, the rectifier functions to rectify the signal received by the one or more non-inductive antennas. The rectified signal may be fed to the controller for receiving encoded instructions from a RF pulse generator module. The rectified signal may also be fed to a charge balance component that is configured to create one or more eiectrica! pulses such that the one or more electrical pulses result in a substantially zero net charge (that is, the pulses are charge balanced). The charge balanced pulses are passed through the current limiter to the device interface. An example of this type of circuitry is described in additional detail in PCT/US2012/023029, which is fully incorporated by reference. The reader is referred to this published international application for additional details. Additionally, the reader is referred to published U.S. Application 2012/0330384, which is also fully incorporated by reference. [0036] In other embodiments of the presently claimed invention, the implantable power receiver Is not connected to electrodes configured to apply one or more electrical pulses to a neural tissue associated with the spinal column. [0037] In still another embodiment, the wireless Implantable power receiver does not include a connector or one or more connector pads. The reader is referred to published international application PCT/US2012/032200, which is also incorporated by reference, for additional details. [0038] A telemetry signal may be transmitted to the implantable power receiver to deliver parameters to the device. The telemetry signal may be sent by modulation of a carrier signal. The telemetry signal does not interfere with the received input signal which is transformed into a DC power supply to power the device, in one embodiment, the telemetry signal and powering signal are combined info one signal; separate electronic subsystems harness the power contained in the signal and extract the data content of the signal. [0039] An RF pulse generator system may be located externally to the body or implanted within tissue remotely from the implanted power receiver. The RF pulse generator system can, In certain embodiments, store parameters that are transmitted to an implanted power receiver via a remote antenna. [0040] In preferred embodiments, the implantable power receiver is integrated or embedded within the device to which it provides power. In other embodiments, the power receiver may be tethered to a device through a conductive wire. The receiver may be tethered by one or more wires to a separate device, not by a connector, in still other embodiments, the device is physically integrated within a medical device enclosure. [0041] The implanted power receiver system can include an enclosure that houses one or more non-inductive antennas (for example, dipoie or patch antennas), include internal circuitry including microelectronics for electricai energy rectification, and be connected to an implanted device or device in dose contact with human tissue. [0042] In certain embodiments, at least one of the antennas can be constructed as a conductive trace feature contained on one of the circuits. In another embodiment, at least one of the antennas can be fabricated as a conductive wire connected to one of the circuits. [0043] In various embodiments, the implantable power receiver is powered wirelessly (and therefore does not require a wired connection) and contains the circuitry necessary to receive pulse instructions and waveforms or other signals from a source externa! to the body. For example, various embodiments employ non-inductive, for example, dipoie or other antenna configuration(s), to receive RF power through electrical radiative coupling. [0044] Furthermore, the electrical radiative coupling mechanism (for example, a dipole antenna) can be utilized to improve the form factor of a wireless implantable power receiver and allow for miniature diameters, as small as 30 microns. Other implementations can have diameters of less than 1,3 mm, or as small as 300 microns. [0045] Electrical radiative coupling also allows for the transmission and reception of energy at greater depths with less degradation in efficiency than inductive coi! techniques. This can provide an advantage over devices that employ inductive coupling since the efficiency of such implants is highly dependent on the distance separating the external transmitter coil and the implanted receiver coil. [0046] Various energy-coupling structures are included in this invention. Some embodiments have only one non-inductive antenna; other embodiments have one or more non-inductive antennas, or a plurality of non-inductive antennas of any given width. For example, without limitation, some embodiments have between three and ten non-inductive antennas, while other embodiments can have more than ten non-inductive antennas. Stiii other embodiments can have more than twenty non-inductive antennas. [0047] in another embodiment, the non-inductive antenna(s) and the microelectronics can be placed singularly or in a multitude. [0048] The antenna is a non-inductive antenna and is configured to receive, through electrical radiative coupling, an input signal containing electrical energy, in certain embodiments, the source of radiative energy is physically separate from the implantable power receiver. That is, the source is remote from the implantable power receiver, and the source itself transmits the energy, for example, electromagnetic radiation, wirelessly. Of course, the source of radiated energy is positioned at some proximity (but not physically in contact with or electrically connected by wires) to the implantable power receiver so that the one or more non-inductive antennas can receive the radiated energy. [0049] Embodiments of this disclosure use electrical coupling and high frequencies to penetrate tissue mediums without direct contact of the transmission antenna to the body, as described and incorporated by reference in PCT Application PCT/US2012/023029. [0050] In various embodiments, the implantable power receiver may be used to receive radiated energy from a remote source and provide power, parameters and waveforms to a device without using cables or inductive coupling to power the implantable power receiver, [0051] The antenna can be, for example, a dipole antenna. Some embodiments may have only one dipole antenna, other embodiments may have multiple antennas of any given length. For example, without limitation, some embodiments may have between two and ten dipole antennas, while other embodiments can have more than ten dipole antennas or more than twenty dipole antennas. [0052] in other embodiments, the implantable power receiver system may include up to ten non-inductive antennas within the enclosure, each independently having a length ranging from one-quarter of a centimeter to twelve centimeters. [0053] in some other embodiments, a dipole antenna or non-inductive antenna can range from about 100 microns to about 10 cm in length. In other embodiments, a non-inductive antenna can range from 0,25 cm to 12 cm in length. [0054] In other embodiments, a non-inductive antenna can consist of any linear non-inductive configuration ranging from 1 mm to 4 mm in thickness. In other embodiments, a non-inductive antenna can consist of any linear dipoie configuration ranging from about 20 microns to about 3 mm in thickness. [0055] The antenna may also be a folded dipole antenna instead of a straight dipole antenna. [0056] In another embodiment, the one or more non-inductive antennas may receive frequencies from about 300 MHz to about 8 GHz. In still another embodiment, the one or more non-inductive antennas may receive frequencies from about 800 MHz to about 5.8 GHz. [0057] The signal received by an antenna is transmitted to a rectification block for rectification. The output signal of the rectifier is connected in parallel with a resistor and DC storage capacitor. The DC storage capacitor helps to smooth the rectified waveform and provide a constant power supply to a device. In one embodiment, the electronic circuitry is configured to generate a DC power supply further including a rectification circuitry and a smoothing circuitry. [0058] The rectifier may contain one or more diodes. [0059] In additional embodiments, the diode may be a Schottky diode, having instantaneous switching and negligible reverse recovery current. Schottky diodes are frequently used in RF detectors and mixers, allowing the use of small inductors and capacitors with greater efficiency. [0060] Conditioning circuitry may include electronic components such as diodes, resistors and capacitors. Conditioning circuitry can use the incoming energy to provide waveforms to devices for stimulation of tissue, as well as help provide power, parameter settings and other signals to the device. The wireless power receiver may include a conditioning circuitry. [0081] Conditioning circuitry is configured to rectify the waveform signal received by the implanted non-inductive antenna(s). Conditioning circuitry may also have charge balance microelectronics to prevent the corrosion of the contacts that are used for stimulation or for recording, and that are exposed to tissue. Conditioning circuitry may also contain a current limiter, which may limit a characteristic (for example, current or duration) of an electrical pulse to ensure that the charge per phase remains below a threshold level. To minimize reflection of the energy back from the exposed contacts into the circuitry, conditioning circuitry may further include isolation circuits to block high frequency signals. [0082] In one embodiment, the implantable power receiver system, preferably, has an overall diameter that allows it to pass through the lumen of a standard 14 gauge needle, or smaller, such as a 18, 18, 20, or 22 gauge needle. [0063] In other embodiments, the implantable power receiver system can be delivered into a subject’s body through a needle, such as, for example, a spina! needle, no larger than gauge 18, or an endoscope, no larger than gauge 22, In still other embodiments, an outside diameter of the receiver is less than an inside diameter of a 14 gauge cannula or syringe. [0064] In still other embodiments, the implantable power receiver can be configured within a larger housing with the sensor or circuit, or integrated with the device that the power receiver is configured to provide power to. [0065] In yet additional embodiments, the implantable power receiver can be tethered by a wire to a body of a device that it is providing power to. [0066] Various embodiments of a wireless implantable power receiver system have distinct advantages over traditional wired devices in regards to ease of insertion, cross-connections, small size, elimination of extension wires for transferring energy, allowing placement with minimal trauma, not requiring an implantable pulse generator (IPG), and long term effective therapy. In contrast to the present invention, larger implantable devices, such as IPG technology, may cause increased scar tissue as well as tissue reactions that may affect efficacy and safety. With the current technology, there is no longer a requirement for an IPG in order to administer a therapy. [0087] In another embodiment, once in position, no further skin incisions or placement of extensions, receivers or implanted pulse generators are needed, [0068] In one embodiment, the implantable power receiver may produce electrical currents capable of stimulating tissue, provide parameter settings to a device, or produce a DC voltage to power a device without a physical connection to an implantable pulse generator (IPG) or use of an inductive coil. This can be advantageous relative to designs that employ inductive coils to receive RF power through inductive coupling and then transfer the received power to a large IPG device for recharging, particularly since the large IPG device for recharging can be as large as 100 mm by 70 mm, taking up from 18 cc to over 50 cc of space in the body. [0089] In another embodiment, the implantable power receiver may be physically integrated with a device for implantation into the body. [0070] In another embodiment, the receiver may power one or more devices. In another embodiment, the device may include a plurality of electrodes, for example, up to 100 or more, powered by one or more receivers. In still another embodiment, the device body may hold a plurality of implantable power receivers, for example, up to 4 or more. [0071] Various implementations also may have an associated lower overall cost compared to existing implantable devices due to the elimination of the implantable pulse generator, and this may lead to wider adoption of neural modulation therapy for patients, broader use of sensors and implanted monitors, as well as localized medication delivery mechanisms. [0072] Devices may include stimulators, telemetry devices, sensors and body monitoring devices which monitor various physiological processes including, for example, blood pressure or other vital signs including heart rate, temperature and respiration. In other embodiments, such devices may monitor a physiological indicator such as a change of a chemical or biological molecule within an organ, tissue or the bloodstream and (optionally) may power a subsequent device to release a predefined amount of a chemical or biologic drug in response to a physiological indicator measurement. [0073] In further embodiments, devices may include recording electrodes, glucose monitors, cochlear implant devices, cardiac devices for monitoring, pacing and defibriSlation, devices for monitoring vital signs, deep brain stimulators, sensors placed externally on the body or underneath the skin, and power drug releasing or time release devices, as well as devices for recording action potentials. [0074] In other embodiments, a wireless implantable power receiver includes one or more non-inductive antennas configured to receive radiated energy. The wireless implantable power receiver further Includes eiectronic circuitry configured to convert the radiated energy received by the one or more non-inductive antennas into (i) a DC power supply to provide power to one or more devices; (ii) a signal to provide parameter settings to the device; (iii) a waveform to provide stimulatory signals to a tissue; or (iv) any combination thereof. The device is selected from the group consisting of: (a) a glucose monitor; (b) a cardiac device for monitoring, pacemaking or defibrillation; (c) one or more internal sensors for measuring vital signs; (d) one or more external sensors, such as EEG or EGG sensors, for measuring electrical activity; (℮) microwires which measure action potential activity; (f) a time-release capsule or a drug-release device; (g) a cochlear lead; or (h) a deep brain stimulation device, [0075] In another aspect, the implantable power receiver system Includes a controller module. The controller module includes one or more non-inductive antenna(s) and one or more circuits. The non-inductive antenna(s) is configured to send a signal containing electrical energy to a remote antenna through electrical radiative coupling. The remote antenna, located externally to the implantable power receiver, is located in a module configured to create one or more electrical pulses suitable for parameter inputs to devices or to generate signals for tissue stimulation. The non-inductive antenna(s) is also configured to receive one or more signals from the remote antenna, extract a feedback signal from the one or more received signals, extract one or more parameters, and adjust an input signal to the device based upon the feedback signal. The one or more parameters of the electrical pulse may include an amplitude, duration or frequency of one or more electrical signals. In another embodiment, the receiver may provide parameter settings to a device which include frequency, amplitude and duration parameters. The implantable power receiver may provide power to the controller module. [0076] In another aspect, the implantable power receiver communicates with one or more externa! devices, physically apart from the receiver, to facilitate a feedback mechanism for parameter control. For example, the implantable power receiver may also include one or more circuits for communicating information to a remote antenna of an external device, to facilitate a feedback control mechanism for parameter control. For example, the implanted power receiver may send to the second antenna a feedback signal that is indicative of the physical state of the biological process or device being monitored, and the externa! system may adjust parameters of the signal sent to the device through a feedback control signal. [0077] in other embodiments, the wireless receiver system may record a physiological parameter, such as the electrical activity of the heart. In other embodiments, the wireless receiver system may contain electronic circuitry to transmit signals recorded by a device wirelessly for storage in a remote device or for processing. [0078] In other embodiments, the wireless implantable power receiver system includes a remote system that processes signals transmitted by the receiver, to produce parameter signals, tissue stimulation signals, or both, which are transmitted to the implantable power receiver for distribution to one or more devices or tissue. [0079] Additional embodiments of the present invention provide a method of providing power to an implanted device. The method includes providing an implantable wireless power receiver including an enclosure, and enclosure housing that houses a non-inductive antenna(s).

The remote antenna is physically separate from the implantable receiver. One or more circuits are electrically connected to the non-inductive anfenna(s) and are configured to convert the electrical energy contained in the input signal to a constant power source, preferably a DC power source. The enclosure is shaped and arranged for delivery into a subject’s body through an introducer or needle. [0080] Further embodiments of the invention provide a method of delivering electrical signals to power to the device, including enclosing the implantable wireless power receiver within the device, implanting the receiver and the device into tissue, and receiving and converting radiated energy into a DC power supply for distribution to the device, wherein the device excludes a connector.

[0083] Neural tissue associated with the spina! column includes the spinothalamic tracts, dorsal horn, dorsal root ganglia, dorsal roots, dorsal column fibers, and peripheral nerve bundles leaving the dorsal column or brainstem. [0084] The wireless implantable power receiver system may (optionally) include electronic circuitry to transmit recorded signals from the device to which it provides power, to a remote system for storage, processing, or both. The remote system processes received signals to produce parameter signals, tissue stimulation signals, or any combination thereof, which are then transmitted to the implantable power receiver for distribution to one or more devices, [0085] FIG, 1 depicts an example of an implantable power receiver 110 powering stimulation or recording electrodes 100, The electrodes 100 are represented by solid black rectangles at the distal end of the device 120.

E.g., up to four, more than four, two, etc. [0088] FIGS. 2A-2C depict block diagrams for the implantable power receiver power generation and parameter control, according to some exemplary embodiments. [0087] In FIG. 2Α, a signal is received by the implanted antenna 200 (e.g., non-inductive antenna) and the received energy (e.g., power and modulations representative of data, just power, just modulations representative of data, etc.) is transmitted to a rectifier circuit 230. The rectifier circuit can provide for rectification of up to 10 Volts DC power per receiver, according to an exemplary embodiment. With reference to the medical device of Figure 1, the voltage output may be configured depending on the depth of the implanted receiver within tissue. The same general configuration may utilized for multiple receivers. Such multiple receivers can be placed in parallel and the output power daisy chained to create a larger maximum power supply to one or more devices. The output signal of the rectifier 230 may be connected in parallel with a resistor 210 and time release capacitor 220, providing smoothing circuitry. In other embodiments, the smoothing circuitry may contain one or more resistors and one or more capacitors. The capacitor 220 serves to smooth the rectified waveform and help provide a continuous supply of power to a device. The rectifier 230 and smoothing circuitry are part of the conditioning circuitry. It should be appreciated that capacitor 220 should not be considered a long term power supply such as a battery. As such, FIG. 2Α advantageously does not include a battery for powering the medical device attached to the circuit of FIG. 2Α. [0088] FIG. 2Β shows a controller 240 which receives, as an input, the DC power supply, from FIG. 2Α. In other words, the energy received at antennas 200 can be used to provide power fo the signal processing electronics and controller of FIG. 2Β. The energy received at non-inductive antennas 200 can contain modulations (e.g., AM, FM, etc.) representative of data signals. [0089] In some embodiments, the received signal by a suppiemental antenna 200Β can be processed by a communication block 250 which is connected to the controller 240. In other embodiments, the controller 240 can pass the received DC power to the communications block 250 for demodulation and passing back to the controller. [0090] In addition to supplying the connected device with DC power, the controller 240 can generates a data signal, which may be based upon the received energy from the DC Power and/or from energy received at antenna 200. The DC power can be distributed to the medical device. In a further embodiment, in cases in which the receiver is connected to multiple devices or multiple tissue sites, the design configuration may contain a multiplexer 260 to deliver a designated signal to a specific device or tissue. The controller 240 may also supply a MUX control signal, to select a particular output channel of the multiplexer 260. Additionally, the output of the controller 240 can be transmitted to a remote site for storage or further processing. [0091] In still another embodiment, FIG. 2C shows a configuration in which the system (optionally) includes a signal processing block 280, The signal processing block 280 is powered by the power generating circuitry, and may also receive an input from a non-inductive antenna(s) 200. The received signal by the antenna is processed by a communication block 290 which is connected to the signal processor 280. Sensor input 270 may be fed into the signal processing unit 280, and once processing completes, the output of the processing unit 280 may be transmitted to a remote storage or processing site. [0092] The various configurations shown in FIG. 2A-2C may be used with medical stimulation or monitoring devices powered by the implantable power receiver.
