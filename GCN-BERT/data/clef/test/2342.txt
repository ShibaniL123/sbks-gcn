BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to anhydrous crystalline forms and solvates of the antiviral compound 5,6-dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(β-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole (also known as 1263W94; a compound of formula (I)), pharmaceutical formulations comprising anhydrous crystalline forms and solvates of this compound, and their use in therapy. 5,6-Dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(β-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole (1263W94) is a benzimidazole derivative useful in medical therapy. WO96/01833 discloses 5,6-dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(β-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole and its use for the treatment or prophylaxis of viral infections such as those caused by herpes viruses. The compound as disclosed in WO96/01833 is an amorphous, non-crystalline, hygroscopic material. The structure of 5,6-dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(β-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole, a compound of formula (I) is shown below: We have now found that the compound of formula (I) may be prepared in novel crystalline forms and solvates. The novel crystalline forms and solvates of the present invention are more thermodynamically stable than the amorphous form disclosed in WO96/01833. The novel crystalline forms and solvates have the further advantage that they are essentially non-hygroscopic. These crystalline forms and solvates have good storage properties and can be readily formulated into pharmaceutical compositions such as tablets, capsules, and liquid systems. The crystalline forms and solvates may be characterized by their X-ray powder diffraction patterns. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided the compound of formula (I) in a novel crystalline form, Form I. Form I is defined by the X-ray powder diffraction pattern illustrated in FIG. 1, which is obtained by a properly aligned diffractometer equipped with a diffracted beam curved graphite monochromator using copper Kα X-radiation. Form I may be prepared from a mixture of the amorphous compound of formula (I) and the novel crystalline Form II thereof by suspending and heating in water or toluene at temperatures in excess of 50° C. On heating, the suspension turns to a sticky gum which on continued heating converts to a solid. In another aspect of the invention there is provided the compound of formula (I) in a novel crystalline form, Form II. Form II is defined by the X-ray powder diffraction pattern illustrated in FIG. 2, which is obtained by a properly aligned diffractometer equipped with a diffracted beam curved graphite monochromator using copper Kα X-radiation. Form II may be produced by crystallization or recrystallization of the amorphous compound of formula (I) from mixtures of methanol and water or methanol and toluene. The initial product of the recrystallization is a methanol solvate which on drying loses methanol to produce Form II. In a further aspect of the invention there is provided the compound of formula (I) as a solid white free flowing powder (hereinafter referred to as the “ethanolate” or ethanol solvate of the compound of formula (I)). The ethanolate is defined by the X-ray powder diffraction pattern illustrated in FIG. 3, which is obtained by a properly aligned diffractometer equipped with a diffracted beam curved graphite monochromator using copper Kα X-radiation. The ethanolate may be prepared from solutions of the compound in mixtures of ethanol and water or ethanol and toluene mixtures. In yet a further aspect of the invention, there is provided the compound of formula (I) in a novel crystalline form, Form IV. Form IV is defined by the X-ray powder diffraction pattern illustrated in FIG. 4, which is obtained by a properly aligned diffractometer equipped with a diffracted beam curved graphite monochromator using copper Kα X-radiation. Form IV may be obtained by suspending and heating the amorphous compound of formula (I) in water or toluene at temperatures in excess of 50° C. Form IV may also be obtained by suspending Form II in water for several months. In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided the compound of formula (I) in a novel crystalline form, Form V. Form V is defined by the X-ray powder diffraction pattern illustrated in FIG. 5, which is obtained by a properly aligned diffractometer equipped with a diffracted beam curved graphite monochromator using copper Kα X-radiation. Form V may be produced by adding water gradually to amorphous compound of formula (I) at around 70° C. with rapid stirring over 2 h. After heating at 65-70° C. with stirring for an additional 7 h, the heating and stirring may be discontinued. The mixture may be allowed to stand at ambient temperature for 2.5 days. The mixture may then be filtered. The resultant grainy white solid residue may be allowed to air dry overnight. Form V may also be prepared by hot water slurry of a mixture of Form II and Form I at 90° C. for 20 minutes. Form V may also be prepared by solubilizing another crystalline form or solvate of the compound of formula (I), preferrably Form VI or the ethanolate, in acetonitrile and allowing the solution to stand at ambient temperature until Form V precipitates out of solution. In a further aspect of the invention, there is provided the compound of formula (I) as a mixture of any two or more of the anhydrous crystalline forms and/or solvates of the present invention, or as a mixture of amorphous material and one or more of the anhydrous crystalline forms and/or solvates of the present invention. The compound of formula (I) may also be isolated by acid/base precipitation. As used herein, the term “solvate” is a complex of variable stoichiometry formed by a solute (a compound of formula (I)) and a solvent. Solvents, by way of example, include water, methanol, ethanol, or acetic acid. Hereinafter, reference to a compound of formula (I) is to the amorphous form of that compound, unless another form or solvate thereof is specified. The X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the various anhydrous crystalline forms and solvates of the present invention is determined using conventional techniques and equipment known to those skilled in the art of physical characterization. The diffraction patterns of FIGS. 1-6 were obtained with a Philips X-Pert MPD diffractometer system equipped with a diffracted beam curved graphite monochromator using copper Kα X-radiation and an automatic divergent slit. A xenon proportional counter was used as the detector. The powder sample used to generate the X-ray powder diffraction data was prepared by conventional back filled sample preparation techniques using a 16 mm diameter holder about 2 mm thick. A powder sample of each of Forms I, II, IV, V, VI and the ethanolate were used to produce the X-ray powder diffraction patterns of FIGS. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 3, respectively. The X-ray diffraction patterns for each of the various forms and solvates are unique to the particular form. Each crystalline anhydrous form or solvate exhibits a diffraction pattern with a unique set of diffraction peaks which can be expressed in 2 theta angles) (°), d-spacings (Å) and/or relative peak intensities. 2 Theta diffraction angles and corresponding d-spacing values account for positions of various peaks in the X-ray powder diffraction pattern. D-spacing values are calculated with observed 2 theta angles and copper Kα1 wavelength using the Bragg equation. Slight variations in observed 2 theta angles and d-spacings are expected based on the specific diffractometer employed and the analyst's sample preparation technique. More variation is expected for the relative peak intensities. Identification of the exact crystal form of a compound should be based primarily on observed 2 theta angles or d-spacings with lesser importance placed on relative peak intensities. In a mixture of crystal forms, the strongest diffraction peak for each form may overlap with the diffraction peak of another form. In a mixture of crystal forms, identification may be based on the presence of a lesser intensity peak that does not overlap with the other crystal forms. To identify 5,6-dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(β-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole Form I, the single most characteristic 2 theta angle peak occurs at 2.57 degrees, or 34.35 Å d-spacing. To identify 5,6-dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(β-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole ethanolate, the single most characteristic 2 theta angle peak occurs at 6.63 degrees, or 13.33 Å d-spacing. To identify 5,6-dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(β-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole Form IV, the single most characteristic 2 theta angle peak occurs at 11.78 degrees, or 7.51 Å d-spacing. It may be desirable to rely upon multiple 2 theta angles or multiple d-spacings for the identification of each of the various anhydrous crystalline forms and/or solvates of the present invention. Each of the various anhydrous crystalline forms and/or solvates of 5,6-Dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(β-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole can also be identified by the presence of multiple characteristic 2 theta angle peaks including two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, or ten of the 2 theta angles which are reasonably characteristic of the particular crystalline form. Typically, Form I can be identified by the presence of X-ray diffraction peaks occurring at at least five of the following positions, expressed in 2 theta angles: 7.90, 10.39, 14.63, 15.79, 20.75, 21.99, 22.77, 24.14, 24.71, and 25.97 degrees. Typically, Form II can be identified by the presence of X-ray diffraction peaks occurring at at least five of the following positions, expressed in 2 theta angles: 7.91, 17.33, 18.23, 19.60, 21.88, 23.24, 23.92, 25.27, 27.70, and 29.21 degrees. The ethanolate can be identified by the presence of X-ray diffraction peaks occurring at at least five of the following positions, expressed in 2 theta angles: 9.07, 10.38, 15.95, 17.72. 20.75, 21.37, 22.96, 23.93, 25.40, and 29.05 degrees. Form IV can be identified by the presence of X-ray diffraction peaks occurring at at least five of the following positions, expressed in 2 theta angles: 9.29, 16.04, 18.67. 22.06, 22.68, 23.34, 24.40, 29.64, 30.92, and 31.62 degrees. Form V can be identified by the presence of X-ray diffraction peaks occurring at at least five of the following positions, expressed in 2 theta angles: 13.30, 18.13, 18.78, 20.41, 21.75, 23.02, 26.87, 28.34, 28.55, and 30.22 degrees. Some margin of error is present in each of the 2 theta angle assignments and d-spacings reported above. The error in determining d-spacings decreases with increasing diffraction scan angle or decreasing d-spacing. The margin of error in the foregoing 2 theta angles for Forms I, IV, V, and the ethanolate is approximately ±0.05 degrees for each of the foregoing peak assignments. The margin of error in the 2 theta angles for Form II is approximately ±0.09 for each of the foregoing peak assignments. The margin of error in d-spacing values for Forms I, IV, V, and the ethanolate is approximately ±0.05 Angstroms. The margin of error in d-spacing values for Form II is approximately ±0.09 Angstroms. Since some margin of error is possible in the assignment of 2 theta angles and d-spacings, the preferred method of comparing X-ray powder diffraction patterns in order to identify a particular crystalline form is to overlay the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of the unknown form over the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of a known form. For example, one skilled in the art can overlay an X-ray powder diffraction pattern of an unidentified crystalline form of 5,6-dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(β-L-ribofuranosyl-1H-benzimidazole, obtained using the methods described herein, over FIG. 1 and readily determine whether the X-ray diffraction pattern of the unidentified form is substantially the same as the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of Form I. If the X-ray powder diffraction pattern is substantially the same as FIG. 1, the previously unknown crystalline form can be readily and accurately identified as Form I. The same technique can be used to determine if the unidentified crystalline form is any of Forms II, IV, V, or the ethanolate by overlaying the X-ray powder diffraction pattern over FIG. 2, 4, 5, or 3, respectively. Although 2 theta angles or d-spacings are the primary method of identifying a particular crystalline form, it may be desirable to also compare relative peak intensities. As noted above, relative peak intensities may vary depending upon the specific diffractometer employed and the analyst's sample preparation technique. The peak intensities are reported as intensities relative to the peak intensity of the strongest peak. The intensity units on the X-ray diffraction plot are counts/sec. The absolute counts=counts/time×count time=counts/sec×10 sec. Considering 2 theta angles, d-spacing (Å) and relative peak intensity (I) of the fifteen most intense peaks, obtained by the method of Example 18 below, Form I 5,6-dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(β-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole exhibits the following X-ray diffraction pattern characteristics: Form I 2 theta angle (°)1 Å1 I 7.90 11.19 58.8 10.39 8.51 49.7 14.63 6.05 33.3 15.79 5.61 46.1 16.95 5.23 16.4 19.24 4.61 14.4 20.75 4.28 29.4 21.99 4.04 21.0 22.77 3.90 100.0 24.14 3.68 35.2 24.71 3.60 20.5 25.72 3.46 13.9 25.97 3.43 43.2 29.44 3.03 13.9 31.09 2.87 14.7 1Margin of error = approx. ±0.05 Form II 5,6-dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(β-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole is further characterized by the following 2 theta angles, d-spacings, and relative peak intensities of the fifteen most intense peaks, obtained by the method of Example 18 below.

Based upon the foregoing characteristic features of the X-ray powder diffraction patterns of Forms I, II, IV, V, and the ethanolate and the methods described herein for obtaining these X-ray powder diffraction patterns, one skilled in the art can readily identify each of these anhydrous crystalline forms or solvates of 5,6-dichloro-2-(isopropylamino)-1-(β-L-ribofuranosyl)-1H-benzimidazole. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the X-ray powder diffraction pattern of a sample of any particular anhydrous crystalline form or solvate, obtained using the methods described herein, may exhibit additional peaks. The foregoing tables provide the fifteen most intense peaks which are characteristic of that particular crystalline form or solvate. The tables should not be interpreted as an exhaustive list of peaks exhibited by the particular form or solvate. Other methods of physical characterization can also be employed to identify the anhydrous crystalline forms or solvates of the present invention. For example, melting point, differential scanning calorimetry, infra red spectra, and moisture sorption are all techniques known to those skilled in the art to be useful for the physical characterization of a crystalline form or solvate. These techniques may be employed alone or in combination to characterize a given anhydrous crystalline form or solvate. The invention relates to the anhydrous crystalline forms and solvates both in pure form and in admixture with other forms or solvates of the compound of formula (I). For example, Form I may be in admixture with any one or more of Forms II, IV, V, or the ethanolate. Alternatively Form I may be in admixture with amorphous compound of formula (I). In another embodiment, Form I is in admixture with both amorphous compound of formula (I) and one or more other crystalline forms or solvates including Forms II, IV, V and the ethanolate. Similarly, any of Forms II, IV, V, or the ethanolate may form admixtures with another form or solvate and/or the amorphous material. One embodiment of the present invention is an admixture of Forms I and V. Another embodiment of the present invention is an admixture of Form II and the amorphous material. Another embodiment of the present invention is an admixture of Forms I, IV, and V. Still another embodiment of the present invention is an admixture of Forms I, IV, V, and the amorphous material. Other admixtures of two or more of the anhydrous crystalline forms or solvates which are contemplated by the present invention can be readily determined by those skilled in the art. The present invention expressly contemplates the foregoing mixtures of any anhydrous crystalline form or solvate with one or more of the amorphous compound of formula (I), and/or other anhydrous crystalline forms and solvates. It should be understood that admixtures of a particular form or solvate with amorphous compound of formula (I) and/or other crystalline forms or solvates may result in the masking or absence of one or more of the foregoing X-ray powder diffraction peaks described above for that particular form. Methods are known in the art for analyzing such admixtures of crystalline forms in order to provide for the accurate identification of the presence or absence of particular crystalline forms in the admixture. In addition to the foregoing, any of the anhydrous crystalline forms or solvates of the present invention may be in admixture with hydrated crystalline forms. For example in any batch containing the anhydrous crystalline compound of formula (I), there may also be hydrated crystalline forms of the compound. According to a further aspect, the present invention provides a process for the production of the compound of formula (I) in anhydrous crystalline form which comprises treating the amorphous compound of formula (I) with a solubilising solvent serving to convert an amount of the compound of formula (I) into one or more of the anhydrous crystalline forms and/or solvates. The invention also provides a process for the production of the compound of formula (I) in an anhydrous crystalline form, said process comprising the steps of: a) forming or providing compound of formula (I) in solution in free base or salt form; b) isolating the compound of formula (I) from the solution and optionally removing unbound (damp, non-solvated) solvent leaving the compound of formula (I) in substantially dry form; c) treating the compound of formula (I) with a solubilizing solvent serving to convert an amount of the optionally dried compound of formula (I) from step b) into the anhydrous crystalline form; and d) isolating the anhydrous crystalline form. The compound of formula (I) may be prepared by any method known in the art, but preferably by the methods described in WO 96/01833, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The synthesis of the compound of formula (I) generally leads to the formation of the compound in solution in the reaction mixture from which it may be separated and purified as a solid product. The compound of formula (I) may then optionally be dried. A number of factors influence the crystalline form of the solid product and in accordance with the present invention the conditions of separation and/or subsequent processing are adjusted to produce the compound of formula (I) as one particular anhydrous crystalline form or solvate, or as a mixture of two or more anhydrous crystalline forms or solvates. A suitable solubilizing solvent is preferably a water-soluble organic solvent and should be sufficiently solubilizing and be employed in an amount to allow partial solubilization to effect the conversion and precipitation for example from hydrated crystalline form to the desired anhydrous crystalline form of the compound of formula (I). Advantageously the solvent is eventually removed by drying under vacuum. The damp compound of formula (I) following the first isolation (as in step b above) is preferably dried, for example at about 30° to about 70° C. to provide substantially dry compound of formula (I). The present invention also provides crystalline forms and solvates of the compound of formula (I) for use in medical therapy, e.g. in the treatment or prophylaxis, including suppression of recurrence of symptoms, of a viral disease in an animal, e.g. a mammal such as a human. The compound of formula (I) anhydrous crystalline forms and solvates are especially useful for the treatment or prophylaxis of viral diseases such as herpes virus infections, for example, CMV infections, as well as disease caused by hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses. In addition to its use in human medical therapy, the compound of formula (I) anhydrous crystalline forms and solvates can be administered to other animals for treatment or prophylaxis of viral diseases, e.g. to other mammals. The present invention also provides a method for the treatment or prophylaxis of a viral infection, particularly a herpes infection, CMV infections, as well as disease caused by hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses in an animal, e.g. a mammal such as a human, which comprises administering to the animal an effective antiviral amount of the compound of formula (I) as an anhydrous crystalline form or solvate. The present invention also provides the use of the compound of formula (I) anhydrous crystalline forms and solvates in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of a viral infection. As used herein, the term prophylaxis includes the prevention of infection, the prevention of occurrence of symptoms and the prevention of recurrence of symptoms. The compound of formula (I) anhydrous crystalline forms and solvates may be administered by any route appropriate to the condition to be treated, but the preferred route of administration is oral. It will be appreciated however, that the preferred route may vary with for example the condition of the recipient. For each of the above-indicated utilities and indications the amounts required of the active ingredient (as above defined) will depend upon a number of factors including the severity of the condition to be treated and the identity of the recipient and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. In general however, for each of these utilities and indications, a suitable effective dose will be in the range of 0.01 to 250 mg per kilogram body weight of recipient per day, advantageously in the range of 0.1 to 100 mg per kilogram body weight per day, preferably in the range of 0.5 to 30 mg per kilogram body weight per day, particularly 1.0 to 30 mg per kilogram body weight per day (unless otherwise indicated, all weights of the active ingredient are calculated with respect to the free base of the compound of formula (I)). The desired dose is preferably presented as one, two, three or four or more subdoses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day. These sub-doses may be administered in unit dosage forms, for example, containing about 10 to 1200 mg, or 50 to 500 mg, preferably about 20 to 500 mg, and most preferably 100 to 400 mg of active ingredient per unit dose form. While it is possible for the active ingredient to be administered alone, it is preferable to present it as a pharmaceutical formulation. The formulation comprises the active ingredient as above defined, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients therefor and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The excipient(s) must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The formulations include those suitable for oral administration and may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Such methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing in to association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets, sachets of granules or tablets (such as a swallowable, dispersible or chewable tablet) each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste. A tablet may be made by compression or moulding optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, preservative, surface active or dispersing agent. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored any may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. In addition to the oral dosage forms described hereinabove, the anhydrous crystalline forms and solvates of the present invention may also be formulated for administration by topical, parenteral, and other administration routes using the carriers and techniques described in WO96/01833. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the preparation of dosage forms as solutions of the anhydrous crystalline forms or solvates substantially completely dissolved in a solvent, e.g. for parenteral administration, will preclude the identification of the particular crystalline form utilized in the preparation of the solution. Nevertheless, each of the anhydrous crystalline forms and solvates can be used for the preparation of solutions by substantially completely solubilizing the crystalline form or solvate in a suitable solvent. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing a daily dose or unit daily sub-dose (as herein above recited) or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient. It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above the formulation of this invention may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents or taste masking agents.
