A bore hole type well requires a pipe which lines the well and which has apertures in its wall to permit liquid to flow from the surrounding soil into the well. Such pipes are commonly made of steel, and the apertures are machined. The apertures may, for example, be in the form of slots of about 0.00 to O.060 inches width. These slots prevent the gravel with which the pipe is surrounded fran entering the pipe. In many instances where bore hole type wells are used extensively to drain boggy or marshy land, for example in delta areas, by pumping out water from a depth of say 200 feet, the water is extremely corrosive owing to its chemical content, and the useful life of a metal pipe, even when made of stain¬ less steel, is relatively short, and the expense of pumping away water contin¬ uously to maintain the land in a condition suitable for agricultural purposes is accordingly high. The present invention is concerned with forming a pipe for bore hole type wells from a plastic. According to the present invention, a perforated pipe for lining a bore hole type well, the pipe comprising a plurality of successively radially superposed layers of fibre windings impregnated with resin, at least one of the said layers having its fibres extending in a first helical direction, which direction is such that those fibres contribute principally the hoop strength of the pipe, at least a further one of the said layers having its fibres extend¬ ing in a second helical direction, which direction is such that those fibres contribute principally to the longitudinal strength of the pipe, the second helical direction being of a hand opposite to the first helical direction, the pipe further having in its wall a plurality of adjacent paraLLel slots, the lengths of which slots are substantially uniform and extend in the said first helical direction, said slots being positioned such that at least the majority of the fibres which extend in the said first helical direction are continuous and pass between the slots, and such that an imaginary line joining the centres of adjacent slots lies at least substantially parallel to the said second heli¬ cal direction. The slots are preferably machined in the pipe after the pipe has been A formed by a conventional process involving the winding onto a mandrel of resin- impregnated glass fibre, followed by curing of the resin. If the slots mach¬ ined in the pipe were inclined to all the fibres forming the pipe then they would sever all the fibres with the result that the pipe would have little or no hoop strength. The present invention arables most of the fibres from which the pipe derives hoop strength to remain unsevered so as to give the pipe the necessary hoop strength to resist in particular- cctnpression loading from ex¬ ternal pressure. Alternatively, the slots may be formed in the pipe during the actual pipe winding operation. For example, blade-like projections carried on sup¬ porting strips may be secured around the mandrel before the pipe winding opera¬ tion commences, the blades being parallel to the fibres in a number of layers wound on at a relatively large helix angle, for example 75° or 79° to the axis of the pipe, so as to constitute fibres from which the pipe will derive mainly hoop strength. The blade-ldie projections should be spaced apart circumferen- tially so that longitudinal fibres can run between them to provide the necess¬ ary longitudinal strength for the pipe. After the resin of the pipe has cured, the pipe is removed from the mandrel, taking with it the strips and projections, and the projections are then removed leaving moulded slots. The projections used to farm moulded slots must naturally be of a material which does not bond with the resin of the pipe. For example, they may be of metal or of seme other material which does not bond with the resin of the pipe. The strips may, on the other hand, remain in the wall of the pipe nben the projections are removed, and may be of metal or plastic or of any other material. During manufacture, the strips may be bound in position on the mandrel by material which subsequently remains embedded in the wall of the cured pipe. The projections are preferably tapered radially, being thicker on the inside of the pipe, so that the slots will have a self-clearing action preventing particles of sand or grit jamming in the slots. The accenrpanying drawings illustrate firstly in Figures 1 to k meth¬ ods of making pipes according to this invention by first winding a normal pipe from resin-impregnated fibre and subsequently machining the slots. In these A drawings Figures la to If show the positions of a few slots in relation to six different windings of res in-Impregnated fibre which make up the pipe; Figure 2 is a side view of one end of a ccmplete pipe and shows the positions of the slots in one example; Figure 3 is an enlarged view showing more accur¬ ately the positions of slots in a different example somewhat similar to Figure 2, the slots being shown in a flat developed form in relation to a pipe axis A-A; and Figure k is a view similar to Figure 3 but showing a different lay¬ out of slots. Figures 5 to 8 of the accompanying drawings show a different method of making a perforated pipe according to this invention, in which the slots are in effect moulded into the pipe during the pipe-winding operation. In Figures 5 to 8, Figure 5 is a view of part of one lining strip used in the manufacture of the pipe; Figure 6 is a section on the line Vl-Vl in Figure 5; Figure 7 shows parts of two adjacent lining strips with connecting sealing strips; and Figure 8 is an enlarged fragmentary section on the line Vlll-Vlll in Figure 7. Figure 1 shows how the basic pipe may be wound. The pipe is foimed by six layers, shown respectively in Figures la to If, of resin-impregnated glass fibre. The first layer shown in Figure la is wound on at an angle of 79°, and the following layers are respectively wound on at angles of -22.5 , +22.5°, -22.5°, + 79° and -22.5°. In this case the hoop strength of the pipe is derived mainly ffran the two layers wound on at 79°, and the slots lie para llel to these two layers, exaaples of slots 10 being shown in each figure. Figure 2 shows one end of a complete pipe and shows an arrangement in which the slots lie in a number of helical rows 12, the line joining the centres of the slots in each row being at rigjvt angles to the slots. Figure 3 shows more accurately the layouts of slots in this form of construction . Figure 3 shows, in flat developed form, the positions of a number of slots lU lying in three rows. The slots are shown at an angle of 75 to the axis A-A of the pipe, this being the angle which we prefer in the case of an 8" pipe; the angle of inclination of the hoop windings of the pipe (Figures la and le) should in this case also be 75°. In "tke case of a 10 inch pipe we use similar slots at 79° to the axis of the pipe. For an 8" pipe, as shown in Figure 3, there would be 8 helical rows of slots evenly spaced around the pipe, and in the case of a 10" pipe there would be 10 helical rows of slots. The slots lie in groups of 36. For example, one group l6 is identi¬ fied in the top row, and corresponding groups 18 and 20 are identified in the middle and bottom rows shown in Figure 3. The length of the slots decreases towards each end of each group, the average length being I.83". The slots within each row are at a pitch of 0.187" and the width of each slot is 0.05". The varying length of the slots arises out of the way in which the slots, in this particular example, are machined. The machining is carried out by a circular cutter consisting of 36 axially spaced cutting discs of equal diameter. Each disc cuts one of the slots in each group of 36 slots. The cut¬ ting discs revolve about a ccnmon axis, and are fed into the tube as evenly as possible, with the result that the discs towards the middle bite further into the tube owing to the curvature of the wall of the tube. In one machine for cutting the slots of Figure 3, the tube is moved axially and rotated about its axis while the cutter is fed intermittently into the tube so as to form a part of each of the eight rows of slots during each revolution of the tube. If, for example, the movement of the tube with re¬ spect to the cutter is upwards as viewed in Figure 3, the speeds of rotation and axial translation of the tube are such that the cutter forms firstly the group 16 of the slots in the first row, and when the cutter makes its next plunge Into the tube, the group 18 of the slots in the next adjacent row is machined, and at the next plunge of the cutter the group 20 is machined, and so on. The eighth plunge of the cutter following the plunge which forms the group 16 results in the formation of a group 22 which forms a continuation of the row containing the group 16; it will be appreciated that the axial and rotational movements of the tube are accurately related in order to achieve this. Figure k shows a different layout of slots. As in the case of the example shown in Figure 3, the slots are at an angle of 75 to the axis A-A of the tube, this being the arrangement for an 8" diameter pipe. For a 10" diameter pipe, the slots would again be at an angle of 79° to the axis of the - k - pipe. The slots are in groups, the pitch within each group being 0.175 inches. The length of each slot is 1.92 inches. It will be seen that the groups of slots lie in rows •which are para¬ llel to the axis of the pipe. 8 inch and 10 inch diameter pipes require re¬ spectively 8 and 10 of these rows evenly spaced around the pipe. The slots of Figure k are machined by a cutter consisting of 8 ax- ially spaced cutting discs. The machining is carried out by rotating the pipe without axial translation while the cutter makes 8 or 10 plunges to form one set of groups 2k of slots around the pipe, after which the pipe is moved axially so that, during the next revolution of the pipe, the cutter can form another set of groups around the pipe aligned with the first set so as to form the required rows of groups of slots. A pipe slotted in accordance with Figure k may have longitudinal fibres lying parallel to the pipe axis. Alternatively, if the fibres from which the longitudinal strength of the pipe is derived are helically wound then there will still be fibres of sufficient length remaining uncut after the slots have been formed to ensure that the uncut lengths overlap to give a sig¬ nificant amount of longitudinal strength to the pipe. In the alternative method of pipe manufacture, seen in Figures ? to 8, each slot is defined by a thin lining of plastic moulded integrally with or pressed out of the lining strip shown In Figure 5. the linings hove the ref¬ erence mimerai 30 and are shown most clearly In Figure 6. It will be seen that the linings lie In spaced groups of 10 in the particular example shown In the drawings, but other arrangements are possible. During manufacture, a number of lining strips 32 are laid around the mandrel on which the pipe is wound, and the lining strips are connected by sealing strips 34 which are secured, for example by a resin adhesive, to mftrelw 3$ of the lining strips. Finally the resin-impregnated fibre forming the pipe la wound around the mandrel 38, the windings fro* iftiich the pipe will derive mainly its hoop strength being parallel to the slot linings 30; the fibre is built up to the height of the line Uo dhown in Figure 6 so as to leave the tops of the linings projecting out of the fibre winding, and the tqpa of the linings are finally cut off so that each lining has an open outer end de¬ fining the mouth of the slot. The lining strips may "be laid parallel to the axis of the mandrel 38, in which case the hoop windings of the pipe should be substantially at right angles to the pipe axis. Alternatively, the lining strips and sealing strips may be wound helically onto the mandrel, in which case the hoop wind¬ ings of the pipe may be wound on at a pronounced helix angle; for example, if the lining strips lie at 15° to the axis of the mandrel, then the hoop wind¬ ings may be at 75° to the axis of the mandrel. In each case, the hoop wind- ings fill not only the spaces between the groups of linings, but also the spaces between the individual lining in each group.
