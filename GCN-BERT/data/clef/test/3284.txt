Technical Field The present invention relates to a cyclic peptide, and to a preventive or therapeutic drug for a disease associated with amyloid deposition, such as Alzheimer's disease, the drug containing the cyclic peptide. Background Art Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease which is pathologically characterized by formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangle, along with neuronal degeneration and drop out. Alzheimer's disease causes symptoms of dementia; for example, progressive loss of memory, recognition, thinking, and judgment, and eventually leads to death. Senile plaques deposited in the brain are mainly formed of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), and this protein is composed of 39 to 43 amino acid residues. Aβ, which exhibits cytotoxicity, is considered to cause Alzheimer's disease (Non-Patent Document 1). Aβ secreted from cells is generally a polypeptide composed of 40 or 42 amino acid residues. In particular, Aβ composed of 42 amino acid residues is known to be deposited in the brain in an early stage with stronger aggregability, and to have strong cytotoxicity (Non-Patent Document 2). Thus, an Aβ aggregation inhibitor is expected to serve as a preventive or therapeutic drug for Alzheimer's disease. L-[Lys-Leu-Val-Phe-Phe], which is a partial sequence of Aβ, is known to have inhibitory activity for Aβ aggregation (Non-Patent Document 3).

Chem., 1996, Vol. 271, p8545 Summary of the Invention Problems to be Solved by the Invention However, the aforementioned pentapeptide exhibits very weak inhibitory activity for Aβ aggregation. In addition, the pentapeptide, which is composed of natural amino acid residues, exhibits problematically poor metabolic stability. In view of the foregoing, an object of the present invention is to provide a novel compound which has excellent inhibitory activity for Aβ aggregation, and which is useful as a drug. Means for Solving the Problems In order to achieve the aforementioned object, the present inventors have conducted extensive studies focusing on the aforementioned pentapeptide. As a result, the inventors have quite unexpectedly found that a cyclic peptide formed through cyclization of the pentapeptide exhibits inhibitory activity for Aβ aggregation markedly superior to that of the chain peptide. The inventors have also found that a cyclic peptide prepared through substitution of some of the amino acid residues with other amino acid residues exhibits further excellent inhibitory activity for Aβ aggregation, and the cyclic peptide is useful as a preventive or therapeutic drug for various diseases caused by amyloid deposition, such as Alzheimer's disease.

Examples The present invention will next be described in detail by way of examples, which should not be construed as limiting the invention thereto. Production Example 1 A 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin (400 mg), Fmoc-Phe-OH (232.4 mg, 0.6 mmol), 1,2-dichloroethane (3 mL), and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (420 µL, 2.4 mmol) were sequentially added to a reaction vessel, and reaction was allowed to proceed for one hour. The reaction mixture was washed with DMF, and methanol (400 µL) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (278 µL, 1.5 mmol) were then added to the mixture, followed by shaking for 20 minutes. The mixture was thoroughly washed with DMF, DMF-H2O (1:1), and methanol, and the resin was then dried with a vacuum pump. The percent amino acid substitution was determined from the amount of an Fmoc luminophore cleaved through piperidine treatment (0.33 mmol). Fmoc amino acid (0.085 mmol) was condensed with the resultant Fmoc-Phe-O-resin (0.034 mmol) in the presence of N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide (13.2 µL, 0.085 mmol) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (13.0 mg, 0.085 mmol), and the Fmoc group was subsequently removed with 20% piperidine/DMF. This cycle was repeated to form a protected peptide resin. The entirety of the resultant protected peptide resin was stirred in triisopropylsilane-H2O-trifluoroacetic acid (2.5:2.5:95) for 60 minutes, followed by concentration and reprecipitation with Et2O, to thereby produce a white solid (5.8 mg). This crude peptide was stirred in DMF (13 mL) for 15 hours in the presence of O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU, 5.0 mg, 1.3 µmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (4.6 µL, 2.6 µmol). The reaction mixture was mixed with water, and the mixture was subjected to extraction with ethyl acetate. The extract was washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, and then concentrated. The resultant residue was mixed with 20% piperidine/DMF (2 mL), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for five hours. The reaction mixture was mixed with water, and the mixture was subjected to extraction with ethyl acetate. The extract was washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, and then concentrated. The resultant residue was purified through preparative scale HPLC (0.1% aqueous TFA-CH3CN system). The purified product was lyophilized to produce a white amorphous compound 1 (cyclo-L-[Lys-Leu-Val-Phe-Phe]) (0.31 mg).

Thereafter, a portion of the reaction mixture (10 µL) was added to a mixture of thioflavin T solution (50 µM thioflavin T, 10 µL) and 50 mM glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 8.5, 396 µL). Immediately thereafter, they were mixed together, and the fluorescence intensity of thioflavin T was measured at an excitation wavelength of 440 nm and an emission wavelength of 480 nm. Table 1 shows the results; i.e., the ratio of aggregation inhibitory activity to the aggregation inhibitory activity (taken as 100) of DMSO solution (control).
