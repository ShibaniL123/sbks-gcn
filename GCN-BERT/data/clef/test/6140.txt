TECHNICAL FIELD The invention relates to a new process of conducting the condensation of 3-(R)-quinuclidol of formula I and (1S)-ethyl 1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-isoquinoline carboxylate of formula II to obtain (1S)-(3R)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2.]oct-3-yl 3,4-dihydro-1-phenyl-2(1H)-isoquinoline carboxylate of formula III BACKGROUND ART Original patent literature (EP 0 801 067, WO 9620194) describes a procedure where (1S)-ethyl 1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-isoquinoline carboxylate is reacted with 3-(R)-quinuclidol, which is in about 290% theoretical amount, with sodium hydride, which is in about 156% theoretical amount, in a toluene suspension. The reaction mixture is refluxed, simultaneously distilling off the ethanol being formed, which leaves in the form of an azeotropic mixture with toluene. A reasonable degree of conversion is thereby attained. Nevertheless, the patent states that the yield is as modest as 56%. The patent mentions also possibility of the synthesis procedure is mentioned where 1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-isoquinoline carbonyl chloride of formula IV is reacted with 3-quinuclidol of formula V in dimethylformamide to obtain 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2.]oct-3-yl 3,4-dihydro-1-phenyl-2(1H)-isoquinoline carboxylate of formula VI. EP 0 801 067/WO 9620194 also report an arrangement where 3-(R)-quinuclidyl alkyl carbonate is allowed to react with 1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-isoquinoline to give solifenacin. Patent application WO 2005/087231 describes preparation of solifenacin by reacting (1S)-alkyl-1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-isoquinoline carboxylate (where the alkyl is a lower alkyl, preferably methyl, ethyl, or benzyl) in a toluene-dimethylformamide mixture with 3-(R)-quinuclidol, the reaction being catalyzed by a sodium alkoxide, the alkoxide being so selected that its alkyl is identical with the alkyl of the (1S)-alkyl-1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-isoquinoline carboxylate (hence, sodium methoxide, ethoxide, or benzyloxide). We have found empirically that all the procedures published so far suffer from drawbacks. The procedure in EP 0 801 067 does not afford the product in a reasonably high yield and, in addition, uses a comparatively high excess of optically pure 3-(R)-quinuclidol which is rather costly. The other route - reaction of 1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-isoquinoline carbonyl chloride of formula IV with 3-quinuclidol of formula V in dimethylformamide, resulting in 1-azabicyclo[2.2.2.]oct-3-yl 3,4-dihydro-1-phenyl-2(1H)-isoquinoline carboxylate of formula VI - is mentioned in patent literature (EP 0 801 067) but no examples of the procedure are given. We have tested the procedure practically and found that, although the reaction between the two components, the carbamoyl chloride and quinuclidol, proceeds at a reasonably high rate without any additional catalysis (monitored by HPLC), an intermediate seems to be formed, associated with acylation at the nitrogen giving a quaternary ammonium salt. This salt is hydrolyzed by water which is added within the product isolation step, and the acid formed is decarboxylated immediately. The forming 1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline of formula VIII reacts immediately with the residue of the acylation agent (intermediate) giving, in a nearly quantitative yield, an urea according to the following Scheme 1. Furthermore, we have found experimentally that catalysis using an unbranched sodium alkoxide, as described in WO 2005/087231, is inconvenient because the unbranched alkoxide acts not only as a base but also as a nucleophilic agent, whereupon an impurity is formed - solifenacin substituted by an alkyl group in position 2 at the quinuclidine backbone. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION The invention consists in a new procedure to prepare (1S)-(3R)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2.]oct-3-yl 3,4-dihydro-1-phenyl-2(1H)-isoquinoline carboxylate, known under the nonproprietary name solifenacin, by condensation of (1S)-alkyl 1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-isoquinoline carboxylate (where the alkyl is a primary C1 - C4 alkyl) with 3-(R)-quinuclidol, the reaction being catalyzed by a non-nucleophilic base (Scheme 2). A non-nucleophilic base is a base whose nucleophilic substitution ability is limited significantly. Non-nucleophilic bases include, in particular, sterically hindered alcoholates C4 - C6) or amines; lithium compounds; or a group of substances known as phosphazenes. Examples of non-nucleophilic bases are given in Table 1 below.

With this base the conversion is nearly complete within 3 hours and no impurities such as have been described, for instance, in WO 2005/087231, are formed. The present approach is convenient in that the transformation of (1S)-primary alkyl-1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-isoquinoline carboxylate to solifenacin requires 3-(R)-quinuclidol in a small excess only. The excess is higher than or equal to the amount of the catalyst (non-nucleophilic base) employed to accelerate the reaction. In this setup the degree of conversion is sufficiently high and the degree of racemization of both the starting substances and the product is very low. The reaction is conducted in toluene at a temperature of the reaction mixture of 90 °C to 120 °C, using 3-(R)-quinuclidol in a 0% to 50% molar excess with respect to (1S)-alkyl 1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-isoquinoline carboxylate, and using 0% to 50% mol. of the catalyst with respect to (1S)-alkyl 1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-isoquinoline carboxylate. Preferably, the molar amount of the catalyst is lower than the molar excess of 3-(R)-quinuclidol with respect to (1S)-alkyl 1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-isoquinoline carboxylate. Preferably, the primary C1-C4 alkyl is ethyl. After the conversion is achieved, the reaction mixture is cooled and water is added. After phase separation, the aqueous phase is washed with toluene. The combined organic extracts are washed with water, brine, and water again. Subsequently, the toluene layer is evaporated to dryness. The crude evaporation residue is dissolved in methanol, and to the solution is added a solution of hydrochloric acid in methanol with the molar hydrogen chloride content equal to or slightly higher than the product content. Solifenacin HCl salt is isolated, which salt can be converted by conventional methods to any other organic or inorganic salt. The principle of the invention is illustrated on the examples below. EXAMPLES Common features of Examples 1 through 6 To a solution of 1(S)-ethyl 1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-isoquinoline carboxylate (0.1 mol) in toluene (25 ml) is added 3(R)-quinuclidol (0.1 - 0.15 mmol). The system is heated at 90 °C, and after the two starting substances have dissolved completely, potassium tert-butanolate (0 - 0.05 mmol) is added to the constantly stirred mixture and the fine suspension formed is heated to boil. While the reaction proceeds, the azeotropic toluene-ethanol mixture is distilled off from the mixture. The reaction is terminated after reaching the appropriate degree of conversion. The development of the reaction (conversion of the substances) was monitored by gas chromatography. The optical purity of the product was determined by capillary electrophoresis.
