Step 3
3-(1-Methyl-4-pyrazolyl)-propyl methanesulfonate
3-(1-Methyl-4-pyrazolyl)-1-propanol (90.0 mg, 0.642 mmol) and triethylamine (173 mg, 1.71 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (5 mL). Methanesulfonyl chloride (128 mg, 1.14 mmol) was added at 0Â°C. The reaction solution was slowly allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 2 hours. The reaction was quenched by adding aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (10 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (30 mL x 3). The organic phases were combined, washed with saturated sodium chloride solution (30 mL x 2), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to give 3-(1-methyl-4-pyrazolyl)-propyl methanesulfonate (90.0 mg, as a yellow oil) with a yield of 69%. MS-ESI calcd. [M + H]+ 219, found 219.
