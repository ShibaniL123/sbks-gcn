DISPENSING MATERIALS THROUGH A WATER-JET DEVICE FIELD OF THE INVENTION fOOOl] The present invention generally relates to dispensing apparatuses and more particularly to dispensing apparatuses for water jet devices. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [00021 Water jet techniques are used for a variety of purposes and a variety of devices such as water jet cutters enabling cutting through rigid materials such as stone or metal or dental water jet devices for dental cleansing. [0003] Dental water jet devices also called oral irrigators are designed for applying water jets over the teeth and gum-line to remove food debris, stains and bacteria (plaque) from the tooth as well as from hard-to-reach areas in the oral cavity such as between dense teeth and between a tooth and its surrounding gums. Oral irrigators are also used to irritate the gums to further Improve oral hygiene, tooth and gingival health, The type of the jet (continuous or pulsed) and the jet pressure and thickness determine its efficiency. When using water-jet devices it is often necessary to apply pharmaceutical or cleansing materials over the tooth and gum-line to enhance the operation of the water jet. Using dental water jet devices was proven to improve or even eradicate many dental problems and diseases such as gingivitis which often causes gums to bleed and/or recede, caries and others. Oral irrigators are extremely effective for subjects wearing orthodontic installations such as orthodontic braces. [0004] Oral irrigators often include a spout portion connected to a water pipe, where the diameter of the outlet rim. of the spout is significantly small to increase the jet pressure of the water when exiting the spout. The device can connect to a portal and tillable water container or to a water faucet, depending on the product abilities and purpose, [0005] A patent application publication No. WO2007/147552 Α1 discloses an adapter for a mouth spray.

TAILED' [0035] In the following detailed description of various embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying; drawings that form a part thereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may foe practiced, ft is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may he made without departing from the scope of the present invention. [0036] The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, provides an applicator that allows dispensing material such as gel, paste, ointment, powder and the like therefrom through a water jet device in a moderated economical manner for dispensing allotted portions of the material during each water jet irrigation-session and during multiple utilizations thereof. The applicator, according to some embodiments, allows dispensing the material during tire operation of the water jet device in an efficient manner both economically as well as medically and/or hygienically, by allowing both prolonging the utilisation time of a predefined gel portion as well as enabling a substantially continuous emission of the material throughout each irrigation-session. [0037] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the applicator is designed to dispense dental material such as Chlorhexidine gel, Xylitol,.toothpaste, or any other dental material whether liquid gel or powder, through a dental water jet device (oral irrigator) for medical/eleansing/cosmetic purposes. Since the gel is dispensed during the dispensing; of the water jet die dispensed dental material can be directed along with the water jet to a desired location such as between the tooth and its surrounding gum tissue to enhance the effect of the water jet as well as the effect of the dental material, [0038] According to additional or alternative embodiments of the present invention, there is provided a water jet device including an applicator that is installed therein, where the applicator allows dispensing material therefrom into the water jet of the device in a moderated economical manner for dispensing allotted portions of tire gel during each water jet irrigation-session and during multiple utilizations thereof. [0039] The term "irrigation-session" refers to each period in which the water jet device is utilized where, a jet of water is outputted from, the water jet device. [0040] Reference is now made to Figures 1-2, schematically illustrating a dental applicator 200 for dispensing of dental materia! such as dental gel or paste: through the operation of a dental water jet device 100 (also referred to as ora! irrigator 100) in which it is configured to be installed., according to some embodiments of the present invention. According to these embodiments, the adaptor 200 can be marketed as a part of the water jet device 100 or as a separate part that can be installed in the water jet device 100. According to some embodiments, the water jet device 100 is a dental oral irrigator enabling to output pulsed and/or. continuous water jets through each irrigation-session. [0041] As illustrated in Fig, 1, the water jet. device 100 includes' a jet tip 110 that has a narrowing conical structure and an adaptor 120 for connecting the jet tip 110 to a water pipe (not shown) which can connect to a water container and/or .to a water faucet for inserting water therein. The conical shape of the jet tip 110 allows increasing the jet pressure to be outputted through an outlet section 111 of the jet tip 110 since the an inlet section 113 of the jet tip 110 connecting to the adaptor 120 has an aperture diameter that is substantially larger than the diameter of the outlet section 1.11, The inlet section 113 of the jet tip 110 includes a base section 112 configured to receive therein the applicator 200 or a part thereof, [0042] According to some embodiments of the present invention, as illustrated in Figures I »2, the applicator 200 includes-a dispensing member 210 having a eannular member 215 having one or more array of openings 212, creating a tube like shape opened at its ends and having the cavity therein, a first rim 211 and a second rim 213 that protrude from an outer surface: of the eannular member 215 forming a recess 201 of this outer surface, for creating a space defined by tire recess 201 created to allow forcing a material that is located within the recess 201 to be forced through the of openings 212 into the cavity 216 of the eannular member 215 to enable dispensing allotted portions of the material through the cavity 216 during the water jet flow through a water trajectory "Vo", defining the direction of the water jet when passing through the device 100 (see Fig, 2) and eannular member 215 inner cavity 216, The first rim 211 is configured to face and be inserted through the inlet section 113 of the jet tip 110 and the second rim 213 is configured to face and connect to the adaptor 120, In this way the applicator 200 can be installed in the water jet. device 100 by inserting it into the cylindrical cavity of the base section 112, which is configured to encapsulate the applicator 200 therein, [0043] According to some embodiments of the present invention, as illustrated in Figures 1-2, once the water jet is applied, it flows through the cavity 216 of the applicator 200 and some of the water is forced out of the openings 212 towards the space (recess 201) where the material is located between the outer walls of the eannular member 215 and the inner walls 114 of the jet tip 110, The exiting water (that exited through the openings 212) mix with some of the material (e,g. gel) located in this recess 201 that is closed by the inner walls 114 of the jet tip 110 and cakes a portion of the material (e,g, gel/paste) back into the cavity 216 of the eannular member 215 into the water stream running therethrough, thereby allowing dispensing water mixed with portions of the. material through the jet tip 110 for applying the material along with the pressured water jet over the oral area to which it is directed (e.g, the gum-line in case of dental materials or the tooth itself for cosmetic materials such as blotching materials etc.), this allows dispensing the water jet along with the material, for improving the. dental/cleansing/cosmetic operation of the material over the oral area as well as allows dispensing the material in an allotted and economic manner. [0044] The applicator 200 first rim 211 is slightly coned enabling fitting a designated water filter 115 to connect thereto through an O-ring 116, The eannular member 215 of the gel dispensing member 210 has a smaller diameter then that of. its rims 211 and 213 to allow this section to be walled by the inner wall 114 of the base section 112 creating a space therebetween. In this configuration, when the material dispensing member 210 is inserted through the jet tip 110 the user may be able to force material through the second rim 213 to the space between the walls 114 of the base section 11.2 and the eannular member 215 by, for example using a removable applying member 40. To allow the user to easily fill the space between the applicator 200 and the inner wail 114 of the jet tip 110. The applying member 40 may include an elongated member 41 having at least one array of openings 42 positioned to fit the applicator’s 200 array(s) of openings 212, where the elongated member 41 is sealed at its distal edge that is configured to be inserted into the inner cavity 216 of the applicator 200; and a connector 43 for connecting the applying member 40 to a pressable container such as a tube container of a dental cleansing material materials such as Chlorhexidme gel, tooth gel or paste and the like. Once the applying member 40 is connected to the tube container (e.g. through screwing threaded at its edge suitable for a standard male screw thread of typical material tube containers) the user can press the tube to force the material into the inner cavity 216 of the applicator 200 through the elongated member's 41 openings 42, The material will further be forced from the inner cavity 216 to the space between the jet tip 110 inner wall 114 and the eannular member 215 recess 201 surface through its openings 212, Once this space is filled (can he felt by the back pressure applied upon the tube container when the user continues pressing thereof), the applying member 40 can be removed and to connect the water jet device 100 to water supply through a water pipe (e.g. to a water container, which is a part of the water jet device or to a water faucet). [0045] As illustrated in Fig, 1, the connector 120 has a back rim 121 that is of a diameter that is compatible to the outer diameter of the elongated member 41 - both can be adapted to a water pipe standard diameter (e.g, standard dimensions thereof), The connector 120 can connect to the rear second rim 213 of the material dispensing member 210 through an O-ring 122, [0046] According to these embodiments, once the. material is inside the space between the inner wall 114 and the eannular member 2.15 and once the water jet device is assembled, connected, to the water supply and operated, the water jet goes along the Vo trajectory 'through the inner cavity 216 of the cannular member 215 towards the outlet section 111 of the jet tip 110, some of the material returns through the openings 212 to the cavity 216' and is carried by the water jet outwardly towards the area the user is directing the outlet section 111, The space dimensions and volume may be designed to allow encapsulating: enough material therein to allow using the amount of material fill ing this space for multiple irrigation session. The volume of this space (determined by the diameter and length of the inlet section 113 and base section II2 and the diameter and length of the cannular member 215) as well as die number, locations and size, of the openings 212 should be designed/configured according to the type of water jet device 100 (e.g. dental or other and/or the jet pressure and type i.e, pulsed or continuous), the material types that it should dispense and their viscosity level, and the. like, to allow optimal economical and efficient material dispensing. [0047] For example, in case of an oral irrigator water jet device 100 the user is recommended to direct the outlet 111 to the gum-line area and therefore this method and device 1.00 allows inserting reasonable allotted portions of material through the water jet pressure through the gum-line into areas between the teeth and gums thereby allowing the material to adhere to the tooth in gum-covered areas by using the jet force that slightly separates the gums from the tooth in these area. Hus dramatically improves oral hygiene and can even help preventing surgery in some case since the material is actually forced, to adhere to tooth surfaces otherwise inaccessible. If the material was merely rubbed over the gum-line before using the water jet. rather than applied during the applying of the water jet as a part of the jet Itself, most of the material was washed away by the water material wasting a major percentage thereof enabling only a very small portion to actually adhere to the covered teeth surfaces underneath the gum-line. The current configuration, method and applicator 200 allow much greater quantities of material to adhere to the covered teeth surfaces while using much less material in each irrigation-session. [0048] As illustrated in Fig, 1, the jet tip 110 edge may be bent so that the outlet section III is angular to the rest of the jet tip 110 body to allow easy access.to oral areas in case of a dental water jet device .1.00 or to any other area the water jet should .reach. In tills case the water pipe can be flexible to allow the user to easily move and twist the. jet tip 110 to access different locations in his/her oral cavity. [0049] According to some embodiments of the present invention, the water jet device may further include a control button or valve conveniently located over the jet tip 110 for enabling the user to. easily open and close water flow thereto, [0050] Reference is now made to Figures 3·4, schematically illustrating a dental water jet de vice 300 with a replaceable (dispensable) and/or refillable applicator 400, according to other embodiments of the present, invention. In these embodiments, the. water jet device 300 includes; (i) a straight (unbent) jet tip 310 including an outlet section 311 and a connector inlet section 313; (it) a handle 330 with a valve mechanism 340; (iii) the dispensable applicator 400; and (i v) a connector 350 for connecting the water jet device 300 to water supply (such as a water container or a water faucet) via. a water pipe (Not Shown). [0051] As illustrated in Figures 3·4, the connector 350 includes an. adaptor 320 that allows connecting to the handle 330 (e.g. through screw based connection and through a water sealing O-ring 322) and to the second, rim 413 of the applicator 400 at one end, and to a water pipe (Not Shown) at its other end through a pipe connecting adaptor 351. [0052] According to some embodiments of the present, invention, as illustrated in Fig. 3, the valve mechanism 340 located, at the handle 330 of the water jet device 300, is designed to allow a user to easily open and close the water jet by including a valve therein that can be open and closed via a press button 336. In this example, to open the water jet the user is required to press the elongated valve mechanism 340 button 336 connected to a first side 332a of the body of the handle 330, which ultimately opens a sealer valve therein (e.g, via a spring 34.1. based release mechanism) to allow water flow and release the pressure or even completely let go of the valve mechanism 340 portion to close the water jet, whereby the sealer valve simply returns to its place (closed position in which Water k sealed from entering the water jet device 300) through the spring 341 release in which it seals water passage towards the jet tip 310. The valve mechanism 340 may further allow' controlling the water flow and not just open and close thereof by controlling an aperture of an opening of the sealer valve therein by controlling pressure applied to compress a coiled spring connected thereto, far example. The handle 330 other second side 332b may be sealed as well by a cover 335. [0053] The applicator 400 includes (i.) a dispensing member 410 including a dispensing portion 411 having multiple openings 412, a first rime portion 415a and a second rim portion 415b; and (ii) a cover 420. According to some embodiments, as illustrated in Fig. 3, the cover 420 envelopes and walls the dispensing portion 411 of the dispensing member 410 such that it seals it while creating a space 401 between the cover's 420 wall and the cammtar member 411 into which the applicator can be forced through the plurality of opening when filling/refilling the applicator 400. According to some embodiments, as illustrated in Fig. 3, the cover 420 is made from transparent rigid material to allow a user to see the remaining applicator inside the applicator’s space 401 to know if the applicator 400 should be replaced or refilled, [0054] According to some embodiments of the present.invention, the applicator 400 may be filled having the space 401 between its transparent cover 420 and dispensing member 410 already filled with applicator, while the openings of the rims 415a and 415b of the dispensing member 41.0 are sealed by removable sealers to allow the user to install the applicator 400 in the water jet device 300 by removing the sealers and inserting the applicator 400 into the handle 330 of the water jet device 300 and then connecting the handle 330 to the connector 350 for closing the water jet device 300. Since the cover 420 is transparent, the user can see when the applicator 400 needs refilling or replacing. In cases in which the applicators are marketed as dispensable applicators - the removable sealers may be designed so as not to allow rescaling the rims 415a and/or 415b of the dispensing member 410, In other cases the applicator 400 includes sealers that can. be reused to seal the rims 415a and 415b to refill the applicator 400 fay using a material applying member that is similar in concept to the one described in relation to Figures 1*2, using a container tube connected thereto to allow filling the applicator 400 by squeezing/pressing the container tube to force the material therefrom into a cavity 416 of the dispensing member 410 and therefore to force the material to the space 401 between the dispensing member 410 and the cover 420 through the openings 412 of the dispensing member 410. [0055] Due to the structure of the applicator 410, once the water jet is applied through the applicator cavity 416 when directed through the first rim 415a towards the jet tip 310 outlet portion 3.11 to exit the water jet device 300 it carries allotted portions of the materia] that enter the cavity 416 and join the water jet to allow the material portion to be applied over the oral area along with the water jet flowing.through this cavity 416. [0056] The water jet devices such as 100 and 300 described in respect to some .specific embodiments referring to oral irrigators can simply be used, to describe other types of water jet devices using other types of materials depending on the-purpose of the water jet device and/or its design. [0057] The cross sectional view of Fig. 4 shows how the water jet is directed through an inner cavity 301 of the water jet device 300- and. through tire cavity 416 of the applicator 400 substantially along a main axis "x" of the device 300 and applicator 400. portions of the of the water jet directed through axis ” x " enter the space 401 between the outer surface of the dispensing portion 411 and the inner wall of the cover 420 where the material (e.g. dental gel material) is located, through the openings 412 of the applicator's 400 dispensing portion 411. The water then return to the inner cavity 416 while taking a portion of this material there with while continuing towards the opening portion 311 of the water jet device 300 for ejecting therefrom. This way portions of the material are being dispensed from the water jet device 300 and applicator 400 installed therein whenever the water jet is applied, through the device. 300. [0058] According to some embodiments of the present in vention, the water jet device may also'include a control unit that can electronically control mechanical and/or other functions of the water jet device and/or the applicator. For example, to control the valve mechanism or to notify the user (e.g. through visual anti/or auditory alarms) that the material in the applicator is about.to run out. To allow7 such indication, some, mechanism that senses the amount of material in the space between the dispensing member and the wall surrounding it creating the space for the material to be stored in (either the inner wall of the jet base section or of the transparent cover of the applicator itself, depending on the specific embodiment) such as. an optical sensor. Once the sensor identifies that the applicator is "empty" it operates a visual/auditory alarm signaling, to the user that the applicator should be refilled/replaced.
