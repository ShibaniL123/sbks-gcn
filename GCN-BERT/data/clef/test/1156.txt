[Step 2] Synthesis of tert-butyl 4-((4-(5-(difluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-2-fluorobenzyl)(phenyl)carbamoyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate
Tert-butyl 4-((4-(2-(2,2-difluoroacetyl)hydrazine-1-carbonyl)-2-fluorobenzyl)(phenyl)carbamoyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate (1.350 g, 2.461 mmol), synthesized in step 1, and 1-methoxy-N-triethylammoniosulfonyl-methanimidate (Burgess reagent, 0.880 g, 3.691 mmol) were mixed in tetrahydrofuran (100 mL) at room temperature, and the mixture was heated at reflux for 12 hours, and then cooled down to room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the solvent, and the concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 80 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 10% to 30%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.800 g, 61.3%) as a white solid.
