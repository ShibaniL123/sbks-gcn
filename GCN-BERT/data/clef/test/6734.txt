1-(1-(2,4-Dichlorophenyl)ethyl)-6-(3'-methyl-[1,4'-bipiperidin]-1'-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyrazine hydrochloride
Step 1. (E)-3,5-Dichloro-2-(1-(2-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)hydrazono)-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)pyrazine and (Z)-3,5-dichloro-2-(1-(2-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl) hydrazono)-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)pyrazine
To a solution of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (13.71 mL, 80.55 mmol) in THF (200 mL) at −40° C. was added n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexanes, 34.91 mL, 87.26 mmol). The mixture was stirred at −40° C. for 30 min. In a separate flask, ethyl 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate (10.38 mL, 87.26 mmol) and 2,6-dichloropyrazine (10 g, 67.13 mmol) were dissolved in THF (200 mL) and cooled to −90° C. The lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine solution was added to the 2,6-dichloropyrazine solution via cannula over 30 min at −90° C. The mixture was stirred at −90° C. for 30 min and then (1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl)hydrazine hydrochloride (Example 1, step 1, 9.73 g, 40.28 mmol) was added, and then the mixture was allowed to warm up to room temperature. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, then ethanol (200 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 h. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and then the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (0 to 100% ethyl acetate in hexanes) to provide the title compound (6.2 g, 21% yield) as a viscous orange oil.
