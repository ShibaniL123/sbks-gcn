SCALP CARE COMPOSITION FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to scalp care compositions comprising one or more soluble actives useful for treating dandruff. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hair and scalp leave on treatment compositions comprising various combinations of hair and scalp actives, are known in the art and are commercially available. Anti-dandruff hair rinse off products are also commercially available. Anti-dandruff shampoos, conditioners, and other rinse off treatments typically incorporate an anti-dandruff active. One type of anti-dandruff agents are particulate, crystalline anti-dandruff agents, such as sulfur, selenium disulfide and transition metal salts of pyridinethione. Soluble anti-dandruff agents, such as climbazole, are also available. Nevertheless, some consumers desire an anti-dandruff leave on treatment which provides a level of anti-dandruff efficacy that can replace other anti-dandruff rinse off products or be in addition to rinse off anti-dandruff products or provide leave on benefits to hair and scalp that are difficult to achieve with a rinse off product. Consequently, a need exists for a treatment product that combines core anti-dandruff efficacy with additional scalp health and hair benefits that the consumer can notice and feel, i.e. effective, and is delightful to use. It has now been surprisingly discovered that the incorporation of certain formulation solvents can increase the anti-fungal potency of a given composition. These, and other objects, will become readily apparent from the detailed description below. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In an embodiment of the present invention, it is directed to a scalp care composition comprising from about 0.05% to about 5% of an anti-dandruff active, from about 0.1% to about 25% of one or more organic solvents, from about 1% to about 99% of a volatile carrier wherein the anti-dandruff active is soluble in the scalp care composition. In an embodiment of the present invention, the scalp care composition provides increased anti-fungal potency of the scalp benefit agent. These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become evident to those skilled in the art from a reading of the present disclosure.

Leave-on compositions exclude rinse-off applications such as shampoos, rinse-off conditioners, facial cleansers, hand cleansers, body wash, or body cleansers. The leave-on compositions may be substantially free of cleansing or detersive surfactants. For example, "leave-on compositions" may be left on the keratinous tissue for at least 15 minutes. For example, leave-on compositions may comprise less than 1% detersive surfactants, less than 0.5% detersive surfactants, or 0% detersive surfactants. The compositions may, however, contain emulsifying, dispersing or other processing surfactants that are not intended to provide any significant cleansing benefits when applied topically to the hair. "Soluble" means at least about 0.1 g of solute dissolves in 100 ml of solvent, at 25 °C and 1 atm of pressure. All percentages are by weight of the total composition, unless stated otherwise. All ratios are weight ratios, unless specifically stated otherwise. All ranges are inclusive and combinable. The number of significant digits conveys neither a limitation on the indicated amounts nor on the accuracy of the measurements.

"Derivatives," as used herein, includes but is not limited to, amide, ether, ester, amino, carboxyl, acetyl, acid, salt and/or alcohol derivatives of a given compound. "Polymer," as used herein, means a chemical formed from the polymerisation of two or more monomers. The term "polymer" as used herein shall include all materials made by the polymerisation of monomers as well as natural polymers. Polymers made from only one type of monomer are called homopolymers. A polymer comprises at least two monomers. Polymers made from two or more different types of monomers are called copolymers. The distribution of the different monomers can be calculated statistically or block-wise - both possibilities are suitable for the present invention. Except if stated otherwise, the term "polymer" used herein includes any type of polymer including homopolymers and copolymers. There is a need for effective treatments of dandruff. Leave-on scalp treatments have the potential to offer certain advantages over rinse-off products such as shampoos: more efficient delivery of the anti-dandruff active to the scalp surface. Soluble anti-dandruff actives are often used to effectively achieve anti-fungal benefits on the scalp. This property places certain requirements on the development of effective anti-dandruff leave-on treatments. These treatments should contain appropriate solvent combinations such that the active is soluble to a degree that leads to increased efficacy. While not being bound by theory, this increased efficacy is believed to be the result of increased active solubility due to the incorporation of appropriate solvents. The present invention demonstrates the efficacious solvent composition that has been discovered for an anti-dandruff treatment to effectively deliver soluble anti-dandruff actives to the scalp via direct application. Such compositions may be designed so that the solvent is able to solvate the active and maintain stable and appropriate solubility over time. In contrast, compositions without the appropriate solvent and/or the sufficient solvent concentration is likely to have an active solubility that leads to decreased anti-fungal activity. Additionally such compositions may result in poor solute stability over time or at temperatures below ambient. Such poor stability would lead to a product that does not deliver sufficient active at each application as it may have crystallized or separated. I.

In an embodiment, the 1- hydroxy-2-pyridinethione salts in platelet particle form have an average particle size of up to about 20 microns, or up to about 5 microns, or up to about 2.5 microns. Salts formed from other cations, such as sodium, may also be suitable. Pyridinethione anti-dandruff actives are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 2,809,971; U.S. Pat. No. 3,236,733; U.S. Pat. No. 3,753,196; U.S. Pat. No. 3,761,418; U.S. Pat. No. 4,345,080; U.S. Pat. No. 4,323,683; U.S. Pat. No. 4,379,753; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,470,982. In an embodiment, the composition comprises an effective amount of a zinc-containing layered material. In an embodiment, the composition comprises from about 0.001% to about 10%, or from about 0.01% to about 7%, or from about 0.1% to about 5% of a zinc-containing layered material, by total weight of the composition. Zinc-containing layered materials may be those with crystal growth primarily occurring in two dimensions. It is conventional to describe layer structures as not only those in which all the atoms are incorporated in well-defined layers, but also those in which there are ions or molecules between the layers, called gallery ions (A.F. Wells "Structural Inorganic Chemistry" Clarendon Press, 1975). Zinc-containing layered materials (ZLMs) may have zinc incorporated in the layers and/or be components of the gallery ions. The following classes of ZLMs represent relatively common examples of the general category and are not intended to be limiting as to the broader scope of materials which fit this definition. Many ZLMs occur naturally as minerals. In an embodiment, the ZLM is selected from the group consisting of: hydrozincite (zinc carbonate hydroxide), basic zinc carbonate, aurichalcite (zinc copper carbonate hydroxide), rosasite (copper zinc carbonate hydroxide), and mixtures thereof. Related minerals that are zinc-containing may also be included in the composition. Natural ZLMs can also occur wherein anionic layer species such as clay-type minerals (e.g., phyllosilicates) contain ion-exchanged zinc gallery ions. All of these natural materials can also be obtained synthetically or formed in situ in a composition or during a production process. Another common class of ZLMs, which are often, but not always, synthetic, is layered double hydroxides. In an embodiment, the ZLM is a layered double hydroxide conforming to the formula [M2+i_xM3+x(OH)2]x+ Am"x/m-nH20 wherein some or all of the divalent ions (M2+) are zinc ions (Crepaldi, EL, Pava, PC, Tronto, J, Valim, JB /. Colloid Interfac. Sci. 2002, 248, 429- 42). Yet another class of ZLMs can be prepared called hydroxy double salts (Morioka, H., Tagaya, H., Karasu, M, Kadokawa, J, Chiba, K Inorg. Chem. 1999, 38, 4211-6). In an embodiment, the ZLM is a hydroxy double salt conforming to the formula [M2+1_xM2+1+x(OH)3(1_ y)]+ An"(1=3y)/n-nH20 where the two metal ions (M2+) may be the same or different. If they are the same and represented by zinc, the formula simplifies to [Zn1+x(OH)2]2x+ 2x A ·ηΗ20. This latter formula represents (where x=0.4) materials such as zinc hydroxychloride and zinc hydroxynitrate. In an embodiment, the ZLM is zinc hydroxychloride and/or zinc hydroxynitrate. These are related to hydrozincite as well wherein a divalent anion replace the monovalent anion. These materials can also be formed in situ in a composition or in or during a production process. In an embodiment, the composition comprises basic zinc carbonate. Commercially available sources of basic zinc carbonate include Zinc Carbonate Basic (Cater Chemicals: Bensenville, IL, USA), Zinc Carbonate (Shepherd Chemicals: Norwood, OH, USA), Zinc Carbonate (CPS Union Corp.: New York, NY, USA), Zinc Carbonate (Elementis Pigments: Durham, UK), and Zinc Carbonate AC (Bruggemann Chemical: Newtown Square, PA, USA). Basic zinc carbonate, which also may be referred to commercially as "Zinc Carbonate" or "Zinc Carbonate Basic" or "Zinc Hydroxy Carbonate", is a synthetic version consisting of materials similar to naturally occurring hydrozincite. The idealized stoichiometry is represented by Zn5(OH)6(C03)2 but the actual stoichiometric ratios can vary slightly and other impurities may be incorporated in the crystal lattice. In embodiments having a zinc-containing layered material and a pyrithione or polyvalent metal salt of pyrithione, the ratio of zinc-containing layered material to pyrithione or a polyvalent metal salt of pyrithione is from about 5: 100 to about 10: 1, or from about 2: 10 to about 5: 1, or from about 1:2 to about 3: 1. Polyols Polyols are a component of the present invention. In an embodiment of the present invention, a nonlimiting example of a polyol is glycerin. Glycerin is a colorless, odorless, viscous liquid that is very common for use in personal care applications and pharmaceutical formulations. Glycerin contains three hydroxyl groups that are responsible for its solubility in water and its humectant nature. Glycerin is well known as hair and skin benefit agent in personal care applications. This material can penetrate into a human hair to provide conditioning and softness via plasticization of the hair fiber while maintaining a very clean surface feel. Glycerin has been observed to clean more hydrophobic soil components (ie. sebum) than water. The levels of Glycerin range from about 0.1% to about 10%, from about 0.5% to about 8%, from about 1% to about 7% and from about 3.0% to about 6.0% by weight of the shampoo composition. In another embodiment of the present invention, other polyols may be used. Non- limiting examples include propylene glycol, sugar polyols such as sorbitol, aloe vera gel and honey. Silicones The conditioning agent of the compositions of the present invention can be a silicone conditioning agent. The silicone conditioning agent may comprise volatile silicone, non-volatile silicone, or combinations thereof. The concentration of the silicone conditioning agent typically ranges from about 0.01% to about 10%, by weight of the composition, from about 0.1% to about 8%, from about 0.1% to about 5%, and/or from about 0.2% to about 3%. Non-limiting examples of suitable silicone conditioning agents, and optional suspending agents for the silicone, are described in U.S. Reissue Pat. No. 34,584, U.S. Pat. No. 5,104,646, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,106,609, which descriptions are incorporated herein by reference. The silicone conditioning agents for use in the compositions of the present invention can have a viscosity, as measured at 25° C, from about 20 to about 2,000,000 centistokes ("csk"), from about 1,000 to about 1,800,000 csk, from about 50,000 to about 1,500,000 csk, and/or from about 100,000 to about 1,500,000 csk. The dispersed silicone conditioning agent particles typically have a volume average particle diameter ranging from about 0.01 micrometer to about 50 micrometer. For small particle application to hair, the volume average particle diameters typically range from about 0.01 micrometer to about 4 micrometer, from about 0.01 micrometer to about 2 micrometer, from about 0.01 micrometer to about 0.5 micrometer. For larger particle application to hair, the volume average particle diameters typically range from about 5 micrometer to about 125 micrometer, from about 10 micrometer to about 90 micrometer, from about 15 micrometer to about 70 micrometer, and/or from about 20 micrometer to about 50 micrometer. Additional material on silicones including sections discussing silicone fluids, gums, and resins, as well as manufacture of silicones, are found in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering, vol. 15, 2d ed., pp 204-308, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. (1989), incorporated herein by reference. Silicone emulsions suitable for use in the embodiments of the present invention include, but are not limited to, emulsions of insoluble polysiloxanes prepared in accordance with the descriptions provided in U.S. Patent No. 4,476,282 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2007/0276087. Accordingly, suitable insoluble polysiloxanes include polysiloxanes such as alpha, omega hydroxy-terminated polysiloxanes or alpha, omega alkoxy-terminated polysiloxanes having a molecular weight within the range from about 50,000 to about 500,000 g/mol. The insoluble polysiloxane can have an average molecular weight within the range from about 50,000 to about 500,000 g/mol. For example, the insoluble polysiloxane may have an average molecular weight within the range from about 60,000 to about 400,000; from about 75,000 to about 300,000; from about 100,000 to about 200,000; or the average molecular weight may be about 150,000 g/mol. The insoluble polysiloxane can have an average particle size within the range from about 30 nm to about 10 micrometers. The average particle size may be within the range from about 40 nm to about 5 micrometers, from about 50nm to about 1 micrometers, from about 75 nm to about 500 nm, or about 100 nm, for example. The average molecular weight of the insoluble polysiloxane, the viscosity of the silicone emulsion, and the size of the particle comprising the insoluble polysiloxane are determined by methods commonly used by those skilled in the art, such as the methods disclosed in Smith, A. L. The Analytical Chemistry of Silicones, John Wiley & Sons, Inc.: New York, 1991. For example, the viscosity of the silicone emulsion can be measured at 30°C with a Brookfield viscometer with spindle 6 at 2.5 rpm. The silicone emulsion may further include an additional emulsifier together with the anionic surfactant, Other classes of silicones suitable for use in compositions of the present invention include but are not limited to: i) silicone fluids, including but not limited to, silicone oils, which are flowable materials having viscosity less than about 1,000,000 csk as measured at 25°C; ii) aminosilicones, which contain at least one primary, secondary or tertiary amine; iii) cationic silicones, which contain at least one quaternary ammonium functional group; iv) silicone gums; which include materials having viscosity greater or equal to 1,000,000 csk as measured at 25°C; v) silicone resins, which include highly cross-linked polymeric siloxane systems; vi) high refractive index silicones, having refractive index of at least 1.46, and vii) mixtures thereof.

II. METHODS Zone of Inhibition The Zone of Inhibition (ZOI) methodology is used for this evaluation. In the ZOI method, Malassezia yeast organisms are seeded on a petri dish filled with growth medium. In this experiment, 100 μΐ of diluted (1:500 in vehicle) leave-on treatment is placed in wells on agar plates, which are then incubated. The applied product diffuses radially over time, with the antifungal potency indicated by the inhibition of fungal growth circularly from the center. The diameter of this circular inhibition is measured, the larger the circle, the more potent the antifungal activity of the product. Each leg has 10 plates and each plate 2 measurements. The zone is measured both along the length and width. Averages are plotted along with standard deviation. Student t test is used to group formulas at a significance level of 0.1. In Figure 1, the composition A (included as Example 1) is demonstrated to have improved anti-fungal activity over that of composition B (composition of Example 1 without Butylene Glycol and Benzyl Alcohol solvents). Composition A demonstrates a 10.5% increase in anti-fungal activity and efficacy. It can be visually noted that the turbidity of composition B is higher than that of composition A, which, without being bound by theory, is thought to be the result of reduced climbazole solubility. As solubility of the active, climbazole, increases the % Transmission of visible light through a sample, is observed as a decrease in opacity. In an embodiment of the present invention, the anti-dandruff active is one which is readily soluble in carriers and/or matrix and forms a substantially clear (% Transmittance.gtoreq.80 at 600 nm) solution in carriers and/or matrix. The transparency of the composition may be measured by Ultra- Violet/Visible (UV/VIS) spectrophotometry, which determines the absorption or transmission of UV/VIS light by a sample, using a Gretag Macbeth Colorimeter Color i 5 according to the related instructions. A light wavelength of 600 nm has been shown to be adequate for characterizing the degree of clarity of cosmetic compositions.
