Use of l-phenyl-3-dimethylaminopropane compounds for treating rheumatoid pain The present invention relates to the use of l-phenyl-3-dimethylaminopropane compounds for the production of medicaments for treating rheumatoid, preferably rheumatoid arthritic, very preferably chronic rheumatoid arthritic pain. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder, associated with chronic arthritic pain in contrast to acute arthritis disorders like gouty arthritis or septic arthritis, which are associated with acute inflammatory pain. Therefore rheumatoid pain, rheumatoid arthritic pain and rheumatoid chronic arthritic pain are clearly separated from acute inflammatory pain (Wilson et al., 2006). The object of the present invention was accordingly to provide compounds that are effective in treating rheumatoid, preferably rheumatoid arthritic, very preferably chronic rheumatoid arthritic pain. This is complicated by the fact that a large proportion of the substances effective in treating nociceptive pain such as acute pain - are lower effective at all, in treating rheumatoid pain. It has now surprisingly been found that the compounds disclosed herein below are highly effective in treating rheumatoid pain, and surprisingly particularly effective in treating rheumatoid arthritic and very preferred in treating rheumatoid arthritic chronic pain. Accordingly, the present invention provides for the use of a l-phenyl-3-dimethylaminopropane compound according to the general formula I wherein X is selected from OH, F, Cl, 0C(0)CH3 or Η, preferably OH, F, 00(0)0Η3 or Η, and/or R1 is selected from Ci-4-alkyl, saturated and unsubstituted, branched or unbranched; preferably CH3, C2H5, C4H9 or t-butyl, in particular CH3 or C2H5, and/or R2 and R3 independently of one another are selected from Η, Ci-4-alkyl, saturated and unsubstituted, branched or unbranched; preferably Η, CH3, C2H5, i-propyl or t-butyl, in particular Η or CH3, preferably R3 = Η, and/or R9 to R13, in which three or four of the radicals R9 to R13 must correspond to Η, are independently of one another selected from Η, Cl, F, OH, CF2H, CF3 or Ci-4-alkyl, saturated and unsubstituted, branched or unbranched; OR14 or SR14, where R14 is selected from Ci-3-alkyl, saturated and unsubstituted, branched or unbranched; preferably Η, Cl, F, OH, CF2H, CF3, OCH3 or SCH3 or R12 and R11 form a 3,4-OCH=CH ring, in particular if R9, R11 and R13 correspond to Η, one of R10 and R12 also corresponds to Η, while the other is selected from: Cl, F, OH, CF2H, CF3, OR14 or SR14, preferably OH, CF2H, OCH3 or SCH3, or if R9 and R13 correspond to Η and R11 corresponds to OH, OCH3, Cl or F, preferably to Cl, then one of R10 and R12 also corresponds to Η, while the other corresponds to OH, OCH3, Cl or F, preferably Cl, or if R9, R10, R12 and R13 correspond to Η, R11 is selected from CF3, CF2H, Cl or F, preferably F, or if R10, R11 and R12 correspond to Η, one of R9 and R13 also corresponds to Η, while the other is selected from OH, OC2H5 or OC3H-7, optionally in the form of their racemates, their pure stereoisomers, in particular enantiomers or diastereomers, or in the form of mixtures of the stereoisomers, in particular of the enantiomers or diastereomers, in an arbitrary mixture ratio; in the prepared form or in the form of their acids or their bases or in the form of their salts, in particular the physiologically compatible salts, or in the form of their solvates, in particular the hydrates; for the production of a medicament for treating rheumatoid, preferably rheumatoid arthritic, very preferably chronic rheumatoid arthritic pain.

The medicaments for treating rheumatoid, preferably rheumatoid arthritic, very preferably chronic rheumatoid arthritic pain for the preparation of which the aforementioned compounds are used according to the invention, contain at least one aforementioned active constituent used according to the invention, as well as optionally suitable additives and/or auxiliary substances. Suitable additives and/or auxiliary substances within the meaning of the present invention are all substances known to the person skilled in the art from the prior art for producing galenical formulations. The choice of these auxiliary substances as well as the amounts thereof to be used depend on whether the medicament is to be applied orally, intravenously, intraperitonealy, intradermally, intramuscularly, intranasally, buccally or topically. For oral application suitable preparations are in the form of tablets, chewable tablets, coated pills, capsules, granules, drops, juices or syrups, while for parenteral, topical and inhalative application suitable preparations are solutions, suspensions, readily reconstitutable dry preparations as well as sprays. A further possibility are suppositories for rectal use. The use in a depot in dissolved form, in a carrier film or a plaster, optionally with the addition of agents promoting penetration of the skin, are examples of suitable percutaneous application forms. Examples of auxiliary substances and additives for oral application forms are disintegrants, lubricants, binders, fillers, mould release agents, optionally solvents, taste enhancers, sugars, in particular carriers, diluents, colourants, antioxidants, etc. For suppositories there may be used inter alia waxes or fatty acid esters, and for parenteral application agents there may be used carriers, preservatives, suspension aids, etc. The amounts of active constituent to be administered to patients vary depending on the patient's weight, type of application, and the severity of the medical condition. The compounds according to the invention may be released in a delayed manner from orally, rectally or percutaneously usable preparation forms. In the medical indications for use according to the invention corresponding retard formulations, in particular in the form of a "once daily" preparation, which need to be taken only once a day, are especially preferred. Preferred are medicaments that contain at least 0.05 to 90.0% of the active constituent, in particular low active dosages, in order to avoid side effects. Normally 0.1 to 5000 mg/kg, in particular 1 to 500 mg/kg and preferably 2 to 250 mg/kg of body weight of at least one compound used according to the invention are administered. However, the administration of 0.01 - 5 mg/kg, preferably 0.03 to 2 mg/kg and especially 0.05 to 1 mg/kg of body weight is also preferred and customary. Examples of auxiliary substances include the following: water, ethanol, 2-propanol, glycerol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, glucose, fructose, lactose, sucrose, dextrose, molasses, starch, modified starch, gelatin, sorbitol, inositol, mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose, cellulose acetate shellac, cetyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, paraffins, waxes, natural and synthetic gums, acacia gum, alginates, dextran, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, zinc stearate, glyceryl stearate sodium lauryl sulfate, edible oils, sesame oil, coconut oil, ground nut oil, soya bean oil, lecithin, sodium lactate, polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene fatty acid esters, sorbitan fatty acid esters, sorbic acid, benzoic acid, citric acid, ascorbic acid, tannic acid, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, magnesium oxide, zinc oxide, silicon dioxide, titanium oxide, titanium dioxide, magnesium sulphate, zinc sulphate, calcium sulphate, potassium carbonate, calcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, potassium bromide, potassium iodide, talcum, kaolin, pectin, crospovidone, agar and bentonite. The preparation of these medicaments and pharmaceutical compositions is carried out with the aid of agents, equipment, methods and processes well known in the prior art for pharmaceutical formulations, such as are described for example in "Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences", edited by A.R. Gennaro, 17th Ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa (1985), in particular in Part 8, Chapters 76 to 93 . Thus, for example, for a solid formulation such as a tablet, the active constituent of the medicament can be granulated with a pharmaceutical carrier, for example conventional tablet constituents such as maize starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talcum, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or pharmaceutically acceptable gums, and pharmaceutical diluents, such as for example water, in order to form a solid composition that contains the active constituent in homogeneous distribution. A homogeneous distribution is understood here to mean that the active constituent is distributed uniformly over the whole composition, so that the latter can be subdivided without any problem into identically active unit dose forms such as tablets, pills or capsules. The solid composition is then subdivided into unit dose forms. The tablets or pills of the medicament according to the invention or of the compositions according to the invention can also be coated or compounded in some other way so as to produce a dose form having delayed release. Suitable coating agents are inter alia polymeric acids and mixtures of polymeric acids with materials such as for example schellac, cetyl alcohol and/or cellulose acetate. Even if the medicaments prepared according to the invention exhibit only slight side effects, it can for example be advantageous, in order to avoid certain forms of dependence, to employ apart from the aforementioned compound according to the invention also morphine antagonists, in particular naloxone, naltrexone and/or levallorphan. The invention also relates to a method for treating rheumatoid, preferably rheumatoid arthritic, very preferably chronic rheumatoid arthritic pain, in which at least one of the aforementioned compounds is used according to the invention. The following examples are intended to describe the invention in more detail, without however restricting the subject-matter of the invention. Example The compound Tapentadol ( (-)-(1R,2R)-3-(3-dimethylamino-l-ethyl-2-methyl-propyl)-iphenol) was tested and is hereinafter abbreviated as compound (or Comp.) 1 A preclinical model for rheumatoid pain is used according Wilson et al., Pain 2006 The experiments were carried out in male albino rats (Sprague Dawley) with 135 - 170 g body weight. All rats were used only once. Rheumatoid arthritis was induced by intra-articular injection of CFA in one knee joint of a rat hindpaw. For this purpose the rats were anaesthetised using 3℅ isoflurane in oxygen. The left knee was cleaned using a CutaseptDF solution. The left knee of each rat was injected with 150 μ1 of CFA; containing 2 mg/ml Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The right joints were untreated. Animals were assessed for changes in weight bearing five days post intraarticular injection. Naive rats distribute their body weight equally between their two hind legs. After induction of arthric inflammatory pain, the weight is redistributed such that less weight is placed on the affected leg. Weight bearing on each hind leg was determined using a rat incapacitance tester (Somedic Sales ΑΒ, Horby, Sweden). Rats were placed in an angled plexiglas chamber of the incapacitance tester with their hind paws on separate sensors, and the percentage body weight distribution was calculated over a period of 30 s. Data were expressed as percentage of contralateral weight bearing, with 100% values resulting from equal weight distribution across both hind limbs. The present study was designed to investigate the analgesic effects of Tapentadol in chronic knee joint arthritic pain in rats after intravenous (i.v.) application. Oxycodone was tested as comparator. Results: Tapentadol significantly reduced the CFA-induced decrease in weight bearing in a dose dependent manner, with a maximal effect of 51.0 ± 11.2 % at the dose of 4.64 mg/kg (i.v.). The analgesic efficacy of Tapentadol was close to the comparators morphine (59.6 % at the dose of 2.15 mg/kg) ibuprofen (54.7 % efficacy at the dose of 147 mg/kg) and oxycodone (46,1 % efficacy at the dose of 0,464 mg/kg) Higher doses of the tested compounds Tapentadol, morphine, ibuprofen and oxycodone resulted in readout (weight bearing) confounding side effects and were not analyzed. Analgesic effect of Tapentadol, morphine, ibuprofen and oxycodone on CFA-induced chronic arthritic pain. Data are expressed as mean percentage of maximal possible effect ± S.E.M at the highest possible dose without readout confounding side effects, (η = 10): Compound Analgesic efficacy @ dose [mg/kg] Tapentadol (iv) 51.0 % @ 4.64 mg/kg Morphine (iv) 59.6 % @ 2.15 mg/kg Ibuprofen (ip) 54.7 ℅ @ 147 mg/kg Oxycodone (i.ν.) 46,1 % @ 0,464 mg/kg iv = intravenous application; ip = intraperitoneal application Literature: Colpaert FC.
