“PARTICULATE NITRIFICATION INHIBITOR SYSTEMS” The present invention relates to a phosphatic nitrification inhibitor compositions and related granules, uses, methods and processes. Nitrification inhibitors are substances that slow or stop the conversion of soil ammonium to > nitrate. In our New Zealand patent 531078 we disclose a zeolite based delivery system for nitrification inhibitors of which examples are N-2,5-dichlorophenyl succinamic acid 2-chloro-6-trichloromethyl pyridine (“Nitrapyrin”) dicyandiamide (“DCD or “DCDIN””) which is HN^NH^-NH-CN ) - zinc ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate 2,4,6-trichloroaniline ρ entachlorophenol thio-urea ATS (ammonium thiosulphate), and > - water soluble DMPP (3,4-dimethypyrazole phosphate). Nitrification inhibitors are of value in farm systems as they can help reduce unwanted environmental impacts of nitrogen. These impacts include the effects of nitrate leaching (which can contribute to the deterioration of waterways) and nitrous oxide emissions (which raise the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere). Using a nitrification inhibitor may also result in increased ) pasture production. In order for the most benefit to be gained from the use of nitrification inhibitors, they should be applied before soil ammonium (derived from the urea in stock urine or fertiliser) is converted to nitrate, and also before the first drainage event of the season is due. Results from trial work indicate that on well-drained soils, the nitrification inhibitor should 25 be applied in April/May and July/August. The April/May application covers the high-risk leaching period over winter; a July/August application further retains the autumn nitrogen in the system and also ensures coverage through spring. On wetter soils with artificial drainage systems and where stock are wintered off, most nitrate leaching will occur during early winter drainage, so best results are achieved from two 30 applications of the nitrification inhibitor around March and May. The present invention has as an object the provision of particulate delivery systems for nitrification inhibitors based upon a phosphatic material, eg, a super phosphate (whether single super phosphate) (“SSP”), double super phosphate (“DSP”) or triple super phosphate (“TSP”), or mixtures and derivatives thereof. It is a further or alternative object of the present invention to provide a nitrification inhibitor including granular material which includes one or more super phosphate in conjunction with one or more other material(s) so as to be a compatible with a carried nitrification inhibitor or mixture of nitrification inhibitors. > It is still a further or alternative object of the present invention to provide granular nitrification inhibitor including materials that include or have included a super phosphate yet has the pH of the matrix in contact with the nitrification inhibitor at an acceptable level.

As used herein the term “and/or” means “and” or “or”, or both. As used herein the term “(s)” following a noun includes, as might be appropriate, the singular or plural forms of that noun. In this specification where reference has been made to patent specifications, other external 25 documents, or other sources of information, this is generally for the purpose of providing a context for discussing the features of the invention. Unless specifically stated otherwise, reference to such external documents is not to be construed as an admission that such documents, or such sources of information, in any jurisdiction, are prior art, or form part of the common general knowledge in the art. 30 A preferred formulation is a w/w formulation as follows: 30-85% Single Super Phosphate (“SSP”), preferably 65% 0- 20% Water 1- 35% Dicyanodiamide (“DCD”) 1-15% Basic material chosen from, Limestone, Burnt Lime, Hydrated Lime, Dolomite, 35 Magnesite, Calcined Magnesite, Dunite, Serpentine or Hydrated Magnesium Oxide. However other compositions are contemplated. The invention will also be described with reference to trials conducted with three DCD including compositions in a closed soil incubation experiment the results of which are shown in the attached drawings in which > Figure 1 shows the results of nitrate and ammonium analyses of soil incubated with different treatments, showing changes in nitrate-N concentration in soil over time as affected by the three DCD including compositions compared to DCD, and Figure 2 shows change for the same analyses changes in ammonium-N concentration in soil over time as affected by the three DCD including compositions compared to DCD. ) Some preferred embodiments will now be described with reference to methods and at least one example of each method. Examples of methods of preparation and composition examples are as follows but are not restrictive. Method 1: > Water, DCD and fully cured SSP are slurried together to form a thick paste. The basic material is added and the resulting reverted SSP mixture is granulated. It is advantageous, but not essential, that both the SSP and DCD are finely ground. Finely ground is ~95% passing lOOum sieve. The grinding can occur in both the dry form or in the slurry by the use of a silverston type ) blender. Example 1: 78 gram SSP, 25 gram Water, 25 gram DCD were slurried together to form a thick paste. 4 grams of MgO were added and the resulting mixture granulated. The resulting material had a water soluble DCD content of 20% w/w, was hard (granular crush strength > 5 kg) and a bulk density ~ 1.2 g/ml). 25 Example 2: 78 gram SSP, 25 gram Water, 20 gram DCD and 5 grams of Ammonium Thiosulfate (99.5%) were slurried together to form a thick paste. 4 grams of MgO were added and the resulting mixture granulated. The resulting material had a water soluble DCD content of ~16% w/w, was hard (granular crush strength > 5 kg) and a bulk density ~ 1.2 g/ml). 30 Example 3: 78 gram SSP, 25 gram Water, 20 gram of Ammonium Thiosulfate (99.5%) were slurried together to form a thick paste. 4 grams of MgO were added and the resulting mixture granulated. The resulting material was hard (granular crush strength > 5 kg) and a bulk density ~ 1.2 g/m1)- 35 Method 2: Fresh SSP, (20 min since mixing acid and rock, ~80°C) is mixed with Basic material and DCD. The material is granulated in a standard industrial fertiliser granulation system (pan or drum). It is advantageous, but not essential that the DCD is finely ground or finely ground in before addition. i Finely ground is ~95% passing lOOum sieve. Example: SSP was manufactured using 16% w/w Ρ Phosphate Rock, Sulfuric Acid and Water having an acid to rock ratio of 0.58. The mixture was cured for 25 min before the addition of 15% w/w finely ground Serpentine rock. 20% w/w DCD was then added and well mixed. The resulting solid was granulated. ) SSP revert in this way by the addition of Serpentine Rock or Dunite, is latter referred to as Serpentine Superphosphate. The addition of the basic material(s) in Method 2 avoids DCD degradation. Without the removal of the free acid, degradation of the DCD occurs and the resulting product has reduced or litde nitrification inhibition. > In use, the granules can be applied conventionally for purposes including those discussed at the outset. INCUBATION TRIALS - Comparison of THREE DCD INCLUDING COMPOSITIONS to DCD alone Dicyandiamide (DCD) has been proven as an effective inhibitor of nitrification in soil ) (Amberger 1989). We see the advantageous propect of DCD being applied with superphosphate to reduce the number of product applications on-farm. However, the affect of mixing DCD with fertilisers is uncertain. This is particularly so if added at a processing stage when relatively high temperatures may occur. 25 We have prepared for trials a mix of DCD and phosphate fertilizers. One mix is a DCD/single superphosphate (“SSP”) mix reverted by the addition of MgO following the Example provided for Method One.. The other mix is a DCD/serpentine-superphosphate ie, Example 2 following the method detailed in Method 2. These compositions were prepared to test their effectiveness in nitrification inhibition when compared to DCD alone to ensure that their 30 effectiveness was not affected by the mixing process. We have also prepared a third DCD including composition. This is a material that is the product of heat treating DCD. The heat treating simulates what may occur during the process of fertiliser production. Analyses of the product showed that it contained 10 % w/w DCD and the rest of the initial DCD was converted to some other product most probably melamine. It was expected that the measurable DCD content would inhibit nitrification but the effectiveness of the other components was uncertain. The heat treated product was included to anable trialling to determine whether the other components formed as a result of the heating had any nitrification inhibition properties. > A closed soil incubation experiment was established with the three compositions or products. The heat treated DCD was added at 10 kg/ha and the DCD/P fertiliser blends were added at 10 kg DCD/ha equivalent. A control (urea only) and 2 DCD rates (10 kg DCD/ha and 1 kg DCD/ha) were included. Ten kg/ha is a standard rate of DCD application and matches the DCD/P fertiliser rate while 1 ) kg/ha matches the DCD rate applied in the heat treated product which was 10 % w/w DCD. All treatments received urea solution at approximately 200 kg N/ha, and were replicated three times. The soil was a Horotiu silt loam (Yellow Brown Loam) collected to a depth of approximately 100 mm from a site on the Ruakura farm. The soil was sieved through a 4 mm sieve and stored at 4 °C overnight. Sub-samples were taken to determine the moisture content, soil water > holding capacity and initial inorganic Ν concentration. To measure moisture content, subsamples were dried at 105 °C for 24 hours. Stock solutions of urea, DCD and heated treated DCD were prepared. The compositions were diluted in water to aid dispersion through the soil and the more accurate addition of small amounts of material. The DCD/fertiliser blends however were weighed and applied dry as the ) material was largely insoluble. Each replicated treatment was added to 150 g of dry soil equivalent (195 g field moist soil) in a resealable plastic bag. Distilled water was added as necessary to increase the soil moisture to around 60% of water holding capacity. The contents of each bag were mixed thoroughly, and the bags sealed to include as much air as possible to ensure an aerobic environment was maintained. 25 The bags were placed in an incubator set at 20°C for the duration of the experiment (14 days). Sampling and analysis Soil sub-samples were taken from the bags at 2, 5, 9 and 14 days after incubation commenced for ammonium and nitrate analysis. The equivalent of approximately 5 g dry weight of soil was weighed into 150 mL flasks, 50 mL of 2 Μ potassium chloride (KC1) was added and the 30 flasks shaken for one hour using end-over-end shakers (Mulvaney, 1996). The extractant was filtered (Whatman #42 filter paper) before being frozen prior to analysis for nitrate-N and ammonium-N using a Skalar segmented flow analyser. The data were statistically analysed using the ANOVA directive of GenStat (10th Edition) and L.S.D. (least significant difference) were calculated. Results and Discussion The results of nitrate and ammonium analyses of soil incubated with the different treatments are shown in Figures 1 and 2 and Tables 1 and 2. Table 1.

This suggests that the blending of DCD and the two phosphate fertilisers had no adverse effect on nitrification inhibition and that DCD was just as effective when mixed with Ρ fertiliser as it was alone. The heat treated DCD product which contained about 10% DCD inhibited nitrification to the same extent as the equivalent (1 kg/ha) DCD treatment and was significantly different from the control (P<0.05). However, nitrification inhibition was significantly lower (P<0.05) than in the treatment with the normal rate of DCD (10 kg/ha). It appears that the heat treated DCD is only as effective as the amount of DCD it contains and the other constituents of the product have no nitrification inhibition properties. This indicates that care should be taken to avoid high temperatures when dealing with products containing DCD. CLAIMS: 1.
