Antisapstain Compositions Comprising a Haloalkvnvl Compound, an Azole and an Unsaturated Acid The present invention relates to formulations for protecting wood and other cellulosic substrates against moulds, staining and other defacing organisms, and in particular to antisapstain applications. Antisapstain chemicals are used to protect timber, in particular freshly felled or sawn timber, from attack by moulds, sapstain and decay fungi which would otherwise discolour the timber and so reduce its value. A commonly used chemical in anti-sapstain applications is 3-iodo-2“propynyl-butyl-carbamate (IPBC). However, IPBC is known to be susceptible to degradation by a number of mechanisms, all of which compromise its performance against mould and stain. Known mechanisms by which IPBC can be rendered inactive are decomposition by exposure to UV, by bacteria, by hydrolysis and by reaction with metal ions. Exposure to UV can be problematic as treated timber is often stored outside in direct sunlight during common commercial practices. Furthermore, antisapstain compositions are typically applied by dipping processes using metal dipping tanks. Often, either the processing equipment used to dip the timber or the dipping tank itself suffer corrosion, allowing reactive metal ions to leach into the dipping solution. These metal ions can react with any IPBC present in the antisapstain solution, rendering 'it inactive, The present inventors have found that the protection from mould and other staining organisms afforded by haloalkylnyl containing timber treatment formulations can be greatly enhanced by the inclusion of a number of unsaturated acids, salts or precursors thereof. Thus, the present invention provides an antisapstain composition comprising a haloalkynyl compound, an azole and an unsaturated carboxylic or sulphonic acid, salt or precursor thereof.

The inventors have shown that the efficacy of the formulations described is surprisingly greater than would be expected based on an additive effect. Therefore synergy is taking place. Thus, preferred compositions comprise an azole and, in proportions which are synergistic as between the two components, a haloalkylnyl compound and an unsaturated carboxylic or sulphonic acid, salt or precursor thereof. It has been found that in some embodiments using complex mixtures of naturally occurring fatty acids, the presence of large amounts of saturated fatty acids can reduce the synergistic effect of the unsaturated acids. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment, the fatty acid component contains less than 40 weight percent saturated carboxylic acids, preferably, less than 25 weight percent saturated carboxylic acids, more preferably less than 10 weight percent saturated carboxylic acids, most preferred is less than 5 weight percent weight saturated carboxylic acids. In relation to the total formulation, the formulation of the present invention preferably contains less that 2 weight percent saturated fatty acid, more preferably less than 1 weight percent saturated fatty acid, more preferably less than 0.5 weight percent saturated fatty acid, more preferably less than 0.2 weight percent saturated fatty acid, most preferred is less than 0.1 weight percent saturated fatty acid. In this context, a saturated fatty acid is a carboxylic acid having an alkyl group with from 6 to 24 carbon atoms. Particularly effective ratios of unsaturated acid, salt or precursor thereof to haloalkylnyl compound are 1:5 to 50:1, preferably 1:2 to 30:1, more preferably 1:1 to 25:1, more preferably 2:1 to 15:1, most preferably 2:1 to 10:1. The ratio of unsaturated acid to haloalkylnyl will vary depending, upon the type of acid present in the composition. In general, it has been found that the amount of acid present should be greater than the amount of haloalkylnyl {in weight percent). However, some of the naturally occurring cyclic acids such as rosin have relatively poor solubility. The compositions of the invention typically comprise about 1-2 weight percent haloalkylnyl compound. If it is not possible to dissolve, an excess of unsaturated acid in the composition, then the unsaturated acid is typically added to form a saturated or near saturated solution of the acid. All of the above ratios refer to weight percent as a percentage of the total weight of the composition. Thus, a ratio of 1:1 will refer to two components being present in equal weight percents in a composition. Thus, especially preferred formulations according to the present invention comprise benzoic acid (or sodium benzoate), sorbic acid (or potassium sorbate), or rosin; a triazole compound? and IPBC; all as defined above and preferably at the ratios specified above. The concentration of the formulation required for preservative treatment depends on the ratio of particular active agents selected, the method of treatment employed, the timber species, the level of protection required and the nature and quantity of any other biocides present; The amounts necessary can be determined readily by one skilled in the art. In concentrate form the wood treatment composition will typically comprise as active ingredients 0.1-10%, preferably 0.2-5%, e.g. 0.2-2% w/w of azole, and 0.1-10%, preferably 0.2-5%, e.g. 0.5-3% w/w haloalkylnyl compound. Typically these concentrates will be diluted prior to application to the wood. Dilution will preferably be with water, e.g. at a ratio, water:concentrate ν/ν of 15:1 to 250:1 e.g. 75:1 to 150:1. The appropriate dilution level can be determined by one skilled in the art dependent upon cost, the type of wood to be treated, environmental conditions and the length of time protection is required.

The small block test substrates consisted of planed timber blocks of dimension 135 χ 70 χ 25mm which were machined from Scots Pine (pinus sylvestris). The upper face of each block consisted entirely of sapwood. Five duplicate blocks were treated with each of the formulations. The blocks were treated using vacuum-pressure impregnation with initial wet vacuum of 650mm Hg vacuum applied for a period of 30 minutes followed by a pressure cycle of 12kg/cm2 also for 30 minutes. After treatment the blocks were allowed to dry slowly on the bench for one week prior to exposure. For exposure the blocks were mounted horizontally on untreated pine racks at ground level on a gravel surface for natural weathering exposure. The decking/cladding structure for natural weathering exposure were also machined from Scots Fine. The dimensions of each of the section types used in construction of each structure are shown in Table 1 below. For each treatment solution, 6 deck sections, 4 cladding sections, 3 joists, and 2 batons were treated. The end of each section was then sealed with a nitrocellulose lacquer to reduce the risk of solution penetration occurring only through the end grain rather than laterally. This ensured that large pieces of ■ timber received the same level of formulation across their entire length. The structures were assembled as per Figure 1. Table 1: Timber section dimensions for pine decking/cladding structure Width Depth Length Pine mm mm mm Decking 120 30 730 Cladding 125 15 730 Joists 100 50 530 Batons 50 35 700 The treated timber were then exposed above ground in an in-service situation defined as Hazard Class 3 (uncoated) by ΕΝ355. The samples were periodically inspected to determine if stain and/or mould had begun to grow. The stain and mould free period of each of the formulations (i.e. the number of months that the sample was graded 0 according to the ΕΝ152:1988 standard) is summarised in Table 2.

Furthermore, the improved resistance is not present in formulation 1-3, which contains DDACarbonate (a known fungicide and adjuvant) in place of IPBC. The levels of each of the active fungicides present in each of the compositions is the same. Therefore, synergy is present in the combination of IPBC/azole/benzoate. The data for formulations 1-6 and 1-7 show that timber treated with a combination of iPBC/azole/rosin has a stain and mould free period 5 months longer than timber treated with azole/rosin alone.. Therefore, synergy is present in the iPBC/azole/rosin combination. Sodium benzoate is a known corrosion inhibitor. However, formulation 1-8 contains sodium nitrite which is also known to have corrosion inhibiting properties. The timber treated with formulation 1-8 showed poor resistance to stain and mould. Including co-additives in the formulation to help prevent IPBC degradation does not significantly increase the stain and mould free period. For example, the presence of water repellent additives [formulation 1-9), UV absorbers or metal oxide particles which either absorb or scatter light to prevent photodegredation (formulations 1-10 to 1-13), or antimicrobials (formulations 1-14 and 1-15) in the compositions used to treat the timber did not prolong the stain and mould free period. The inclusion of adjuvants such as amine proprionate or Ethoduomeen T13© (an ethoxylated diamine)(formulations 1-15 and 1-16), which could be expected to facilitate azole/lPBC penetration, also does not prolong the stain and mould free period. Example 2 A trial was conducted in which a number of formulations were investigated for their ability to prevent blue stain growth. The formulations were prepared by adding all of the water insoluble ingredients.(℮.g. azoles, IPBC, any insoluble acids etc.) to the solvent (Dowanol DPM®) and stirring until fully dissolved. The surfactant was then stirred in and water added. Any water soluble additives (e.g. sodium benzoate) were added last.

The grading system is in accordance with ΕΝ152:1988 parts 1 and 2, which is the standard concerning a laboratory method for determination of the protective effectiveness of a wood preservative treatment against blue stain in wood in service. Table 3: Blue Stain Assessment Grades. Grade Blue Stain Level 0 Not blue stained: no blue stain can be detected visually on the surface. 1 Insignificantly blue stained. The surface exhibits only individual small blue stained spots with a largest diameter of 2mm. 2 Blue stained: the surface is continuously blue stained up to a maximum of one third of the surface area, or blue stained partially or in streaks up to half the total area. 3 Strongly blue stained. More than half the surface area is continuously stained or more than half the surface area is partially blue stained. The blue stain grading for each of the formulations is shown in Table 4.

Commercially acceptable blue stain levels are considered to.be grades 0 and 1 only. The data in Table 4 demonstrate that the majority of., the formulations according to the invention meet the commercially acceptable standards. Of the formulations according to the invention that did not achieve grade 0 or 1, the addition of the unsaturated acid was nevertheless found to be an improvement over the composition absent the acid (see formulations ΐΐ-26 to 11-28 as compared to formulations xi-29 to 11-31; and formulations ΐΐ-32, II-35 and 11-36 as compared to formulation 11-19). It is notable that the grading scheme is not entirely satisfactory, given the lack of an intermediate level between grade 1 (insignificant stain) and grade 2 (stain partially or in streaks up to half the total area); This may explain why a number of the formulations according to the invention fail to meet current commercial standards, despite the fact that the timber boards treated with these compositions show a marked improvement over the relevant control boards. To aid comparison of the different formulations, photographs of the test samples were taken after 25 weeks’ exposure under diffuse daylight (i.e. overcast conditions) using a Fuji FinePix S5700 digital camera. White balance was set to overcast. Automatic exposure was used giving a typical, aperture of f/4.0 and 1/160 second exposure. The samples were photographed from a distance of around 60cm with the camera held perpendicular to the plane of the block surface. The photographs obtained were then visually compared to reference samples treated with the equivalent IPBC/Azole formulation absent the additive. These visual comparisons were done by systematically comparing side-by-side colour photographs (displayed on a computer screen) of the exposed wood substrates, and rating the aesthetic quality of the substrates treated with the formulation according to the invention compared its respective control substrate absent the unsaturated acid. A rating of very high indicates that no noticeable discolouration of the substrate is observable, while high indicates that only minor staining is present. A rating of moderate indicates that although staining is present, the composition represents a noticeable improvement over the control sample. Table 5 summarises the results from these visual comparisons. Formulation Unsaturated acid Anti-Stain Performance Effectiveness 11-24 Na Benzoate Very high 11-27* Abietic acid Moderate 11-32 Na Salicyclate High 11-33 Κ Sorbate Very high 11-34 Rosin Very high 11-35 Sorbic acid High 11-36 ■ Oleic acid High Table 5: Results from visual comparison of unsaturated acid containing formulations versus formulation 11-19 containing only iPBC/tebuconazole/propiconazole (* denotes the comparison is made with respect to formulation 11-16) Figures 2 to 5 show pictures taken after exposure for 25 weeks of the substrates treated with formulations II-2, 11-14, 11-19 and 11-24 respectively. A comparison of these photographs clearly shows that the combination of IPBC, tebuconazole/propiconazole and sodium benzoate shows a marked improvement over formulations that are absent one of these three ingredients. Figure 6 shows the substrates treated with formulation Il-l (IPBC) after 25 weeks' exposure. Notably, a comparison of Figures 2 and 6 shows that sodium benzoate appears to improve the efficacy of IPBC even when an azole is not present, demonstrating that the unsaturated acid serves to stabilise IPBC improving its long term efficacy. The data in Table 5 indicate that all of the formulations according to the invention except that containing abietic acid can be rated as high or very high anti-stain performance, indicating that the addition of the unsaturated acid greatly increases the resistance to blue stain growth. However, Figures 7 and 8 clearly show that even though it was only rated as moderate, abietic acid clearly improves the efficacy of a mixture containing IPBC/tebuconazole. The pictures of the substrates from the remaining formulations given in Table 5 are shown in Figures 9 to 13 . As can be seen, the wood treated with formulations 11-32, 11-33, 11-34, 11-35, and 11-36 all show lower blue stain levels than the control formulation 11-19, shown in Figure 4. In particular, the substrates treated with Formulations 11-33 and 11-34 show virtually no blue stain, indicating that potassium sorbate and rosin are particularly effective unsaturated acids in the formulations of the present invention.
