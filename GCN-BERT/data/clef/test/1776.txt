BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Low molecular weight organic compounds termed compatible solutes have been identified in the cytoplasm of many halophilic or halotolerant organisms which counterbalance the osmotic pressure of the external medium and which promote correct protein folding, inhibit protein aggregation, and prevent heat-induced denaturation (Faria 2008, Faria 2013). Compatible solutes are therefore industrially useful, for example, for stabilizing proteins in pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations (Luley-Goedl 2011, Lentzen 2006). Compatible solutes are usually amino acids, carbohydrates, polyols, betaines and ectoines. Trehalose, glycerol, glycine- betaine and ectoine are typical compatible solutes of mesophiles. The discovery of extreme thermophilic and hyperthermophilic microorganisms led to the discovery of additional compatible solutes, such as mannosylglycerate (MG) and dimyo-inositol-1, 3' -phosphate (Faria 2008). Compounds structurally related to MG, namely (2S) -2- (1-O-oc-D- Mannopyranosyl) propionate (ML), 2- ( 1-O-a-Dmannopyranosyl) acetate (MGlyc) , 1-0- (2-glyceryl) -a-D-mannopyranoside (MGOH) , have been synthesized and tested for their ability to stabilize model proteins against thermal stress. (Faria 2008). New compounds for the stabilization of biological materials are needed.

Example 1: Synthesis of novel compatible solutes A chemical library based on sugar derivatives was prepared in order to identify new organic compounds with increased protein stabilization properties. The diversity of the analogue structures was introduced by using different hexoses, such as glucose, galactose, mannose and glucosamine, and by using different glycosyl acceptors during the glycosylation reaction. Galactose and glucosamine analogues were synthesized in addition to mannosides and glucosides in order to assess the contribution of the sugar structure for the stabilization effect. To our knowledge, only one galactose containing compatible solute has been isolated from hyperthermophiles, the -galactopyranosyl-5-hydroxylysine (GalHI) from Thermococcus litoralis: Several amino acids, like glutamate, proline, and glutamine, can function as compatible solutes in many mesophilic organisms and both a- and β-amino acids are used for osmoadaptation (Costa 1998) . In order to determine if an amino group or the extra charge would enhance the stabilisation effect glucosamine derivatives were synthesized. To our knowledge, only one glucosamine containing compatible solute has been isolated from hyperthermophiles, di-N-acetyl- glucosamine phosphate (DAGAP) from Rubrobacter xylanophilus: (Empadinhas 2007) . DAGAP is structurally similar to the phosphodiester compatible solutes found in hyperthermophiles, like DIP or DGP, however, the role as a compatible solute has been refuted due to the concentrations that are too low to contribute to the cell's osmotic balance. All of the glycosyl acceptors chosen for this study are charged and structurally related to glycerate with point modifications, such as more or less carbon atoms, loss of a hydroxyl group, an additional carboxylic group and the configuration at the asymmetric, center, when present: 7 4 133 134 Methyl gtycolate Methyl (S)-lactate Ethyl 3-hydroxybutyrate Dimethyl (S)-maIate OH OH TBDPSO TBDPSO C02Me ^-^CO^e 9 135 Methyl (2/?)-3-0-fert-butylcliphenylsilyl- Methyl (2S)-3-0-terf-butyldiphenylsilyl- 2,3-hidroxypropanoate 2,3-hidroxypropanoate For the synthesis of the glucose and galactose derivatives, thioglycoside donors 1 and 19 were synthesized. The results obtained for the glycosylation reaction of donors 1 and 19 with the glycosyl acceptors above using NIS/TfOH system (Lourenco 2009) in dichloromethane are described in Table 1. All acceptors were commercially available with exception of the methyl glycerate derivatives 9 and 135, which were synthesised according to the experimental procedures reported for D- serine (Lourenco 2009; Lok 1976) . 1 : Glucose 19: Galactose Scheme 1: Glycosylation reaction using thioglycoside donors 1 and 19 Reactions gave a mixture of anomers for most of the glycosyl acceptors. This provided the opportunity to test a and β anomers separately to determine the importance of the stereochemistry of the anomeric position for the stabilization effect. This was the case for the D/L- glycerate and malate galactosyl derivatives. Table 1: Results obtained for the glycosylation reaction with the thioglycoside donors 1 and 19 . aCalculated after deprotection of the acetate group. After the successive removal of the protective groups using common organic reactions, such as methanolysis of the acetates, fluorolysis of the silyl ether in the case of the glycerate analogues (compounds 35 , 140 and 141 ) and hydrolysis of the ester group (Scheme 2), the desired products were obtained (Table 2). a) NaOMe, MeOH, 0°C-f.t b) Hz(g), Pd/C. 50 psi, AcOEt, r± c) KOH/HJ , r.L Scheme 2: General deprotection scheme for the glucose and galactose analogues. Table 2: Final products and overall yields3 for glucose and galactose derivatives. a Calculated from the glycosylation reaction. Overall the products were successfully obtained in good yields and the anomer was the major product. Although in some cases a mixture of a and β anomers was obtained (enriched in α) , they were used for a preliminary screening where the most promising compounds would then be tested separately. The lowest yields were obtained for the derivatives of the dimethyl (S) -malate (150, 151 and 152, Table 2) due to the use of base in the removal of the acetates and in the hydrolysis of the methyl ester, which promoted the hydrolysis of the anoraeric position, by elimination of the malate moiety. This problem has been reported in the literature in the synthesis of bacillithiol (BSH) (Sharma 2011) . To minimize the elimination of the malate moiety, careful ester hydrolysis left traces of the mono-ester in the final product. For the synthesis of the 1,2-trans mannosides, the C-2 acyl neighboring group participation strategy was applied using acetates as protecting groups, and trichloroacetamidates as glycosyl donors, which are relatively fast to prepare and inexpensive. Glycosylation reaction between the mannose trichloroacetimidate donor 103 and the glycosyl acceptors, using BF30Et2 as the promoter, afforded as expected exclusively the α-products . The results obtained for the glycosylation reaction with the mannose donor 103 are presented in Table 3. Scheme 3: Glycosylation reaction with the mannose trichloroacetimide donor 103.

Table 4: Final products and overall yields3 for mannose products . a Calculated from the glycosylation reaction Hydrolysis of the acetate groups and of the methyl ester of mannosyl dimethyl (S)-malate derivative presented the same problem described above for the glucose and galactose derivatives. The 1,2-cis glucosamine derivatives were synthesised from the 2-azido-2- deoxythioglucoside donor 90, and the glycosylation reaction with the glycosyl acceptors conducted in a mixture of CH2C12/Et20 (4:1) at -10°C and using NIS/TfOH as promotor.

Table 5: Results obtained for the glycosylation reaction with the 2-^azido-2-deoxythioglucoside donor 90. The a anomer was the major product for all of the acceptors used. After methanolysis of the acetate group and in the case of the glycerate derivative fluorolysis of the silyl ether, catalytic hydrogenation of the benzyl group with simultaneous reduction of the azide promoted the formation of an undesired cyclic amide (Scheme 6) . This effect was only observed for the a anomers . 163: R= e 167: R=Me, 84% 164: R=H 168: R=H, 81% 165: R=CHzOH 169: R=CH20H, 80% 166: R-^CHjjCOzMe 170: R- CHaCOzH. 87% Scheme 6: Hydrogenation of the 2-azido-2-deoxyglucoside derivatives . Since charge is important for the stabilisation effect, to overcome this problem previous reduction of the azide using a Staudinger reaction, followed by protection of the resulting amine group with acetate (Scheme 7) blocked the amine and avoided cyclisation. After removal of the protecting groups and hydrolysis of the methyl ester the final W-acetyl glucosamine derivatives were obtained. 95: R=Me 171 : R= e 162: R- CHzCOz e 172: R=CH2cP2Me 173: R= e, 46% (after 4 steps) 174: =ΟΗ; 02-Κ+, 33% (after 4 steps) a) (i) R13P, THF, AcOH, CC-r.L (ii) Α¾0, 0°C. b) NaOMe, MeOH, 0°C. c) H-, (g).

Example 2: Protein stabilizing effects of the compatible solutes of Example 1 in three model proteins The ability of the new synthetic analogues to stabilize three model proteins against thermal stress was assessed using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) . In this study, malate dehydrogenase (MDH) , staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) and lysozyme were used as model proteins, and the stabilising effect of the synthetic compounds was compared with the effect of natural solutes, like MG and GG as well as potassium chloride, and other previously synthesised non-natural solutes, like MGlyc and ML. The compounds tested are shown in Tables 6 and 7. Table 6 : Chemical structures of the natural and synthetic glucose, galactose and mannose derivatives tested in this study. Table 7: Chemical structures of the synthetic glucosamine and The DSF based stability assays were performed at each protein working pH and the melting temperatures (TM) values determined in the absence (control experiments) and in the presence of solutes, and at different solute concentrations. The denaturation curves for each assay were analysed, and the melting temperatures determined by the calculation of the first derivative, which corresponds to the midpoint temperature of the protein-unfolding transition. In the absence of solutes, malate dehydrogenase (MDH) , staphylococcal nuclease (SNase) and lysozyme have melting temperatures (TM) of 50, 52 and 71°C respectively. The unfolding temperature shifts ( ΔΤΜ ) were calculated by comparing the TM values obtained in the presence of solutes with the TM values of the control experiments (absence of solutes). Positive ΔΤΜ values correspond to an increase in the TM meaning that the protein is more stable and more energy (heat) is needed to unfold it. Negative ΔΤΜ values correspond to a decrease in the TM meaning that the protein is less stable. The increment in the melting temperature ( ΔΤΜ) of the three enzymes induced by the presence of the synthetic and the natural solutes is depicted in Figure 1. Analysis of different glucose derivatives (Figure 2) and galactose (Figure 3) showed the importance of the non- glycosidic group attached do the hexose. Concerning the importance of the sugar structure different lactate (Figure 4) and malate derivatives (Figure 5) were analysed. When plotting the increment of the melting temperature of MDH versus those of SNase and lysozyme (Figures 2-5) , a general view of the results arises. General conclusions for the tested proteins: charged compounds are better stabilisers; - malate (the best) and lactate derivatives give higher stabilization; the non-sugar moiety has greater influence in the stabilisation effect than the hexose structure; and — glucose and galactose derivatives are better stabilisers. The stabilising effect of potassium acetate salt (AcOK) on lysozyme was studied in conjugation with the hypersolutes (Figure 6) . The results showed that alone AcOK is not a good stabiliser, stabilising only at high salt concentrations. However, in conjugation with the hypersolutes it is able to enhance their stabilisation properties. To determine the importance of the glycosidic linkage of the sugar for the stabilisation effect, different a and β anomers of D and L-galactosyl glycerates were studied (Figure 7). Results obtained for the three enzymes showed that L-glycerates were better stabilisers than the natural D-glycerate derivatives, and that the β-anomers were better stabilisers than those with the β configuration . In order to study the dependence of the increment of the - melting temperature on the concentration of the solutes, the proteins were tested at different solute concentrations - 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 (Figure 8, Figure 9, and Figure 10). For the three proteins, results showed that independent of the degree of stabilisation, the stabilisation effect was directly proportional to the concentration of the solute. Although the results obtained seem to follow a general trend, when taking a closer look in the case of SNase (Figure 8) and lysozyme (Figure 10) a-galactosyl malate is clearly the best stabiliser. In the case of DH the results show that glucosyl malate was the best stabiliser for this enzyme. Ma terials Mannosylglycerate (MG) , glucosylglycerate (GG) , glucosylglucosylglycerate (GGG) , mannosyl glycolate (MGly) and mannosyl lactate (ML) were obtained by chemical synthesis as described in literature (Costa 1998). New synthetic compounds were obtained by chemical synthesis as described in Example 1. The desired compounds were purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Sephadex G-10 column eluted with water. The fractions containing the pure compounds were pooled, lyophilized. Purity and concentration of the compounds was assessed by XH NMR spectra obtained at 500 MHz spectrometer in D2O. For quantification purposes, spectra were acquired with a repetition delay of 60 s with formate as concentration standard. Only samples with purity higher than 98% were used. Mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase from pig heart (MDII) was purchased from Roche, and hen egg white lysozyme was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich . These enzymes were used without further purification. Recombinant staphylococcal nuclease A (SNase) was produced and purified from Escherichia coli cells as described by Faria 2008. Protein concentration was determined from UV absorbance at 280 nm, using 0.28 (mg/mL) "1cm"1 for the extinction coefficient of MDH, 2.58 (mg/mL) "1crtf1 for lysozyme and 0.93 (mg/mL) _1cm_1 for SNase. DSF assay The protein melting temperature (TM) determination was performed by monitoring protein unfolding with the fluoroprobe SYPRO Orange dye (Molecular Probes) , which although completely quenched in aqueous environment, emits fluorescence upon binding to protein hydrophobic patches. Such increase in fluorescence can be measured as a function of temperature using Differential Scanning Fluorimetry. In a typical assay with a total volume of 20 μL, a protein concentration from 0.14 to 0.21 mg/mL, and a dye concentration of 5 fold were used to guarantee the best signal to noise ratio. Protein stock solutions of SNase or MDH were prepared in phosphate buffer (20 mM of sodium phosphate, pH 7.6), and lysozyme was prepared in citrate buffer (40 mM sodium citrate, 110 mM NaCl, pH 6.0). These stock solutions were extensively dialyzed against the same buffer before the assays. Protein concentrations approximately 1.9 μΜ were used for MDH, 12.4 μΜ for SNase and 13 μΜ for lysozyme. Solute solutions were prepared in water with the respective concentrations. The assay was prepared by adding 2 μL of protein to 8 L of dye buffer solution, and 10 μL of solute solution, all prepared in the protein purification buffer except for the solutes solutions. Fluorescence intensities versus temperature are used to calculate the protein melting temperature (TM) by determining the first derivative (d(Rfu)/dT) to extract the exact transition inflection point. Example 3: Stabilizing effect of six compatible solutes of Example 1 on porcine insulin The ability of galactosyl lactate 143, galactosyl butyrate 149, galactosyl glycerate 146, glucosyl butyrate 148, glucosyl glycolate 144, and glucosyl malate 150 to stabilize porcine insulin was studied using the DSF assay described in Example 2. For the assay, solutions comprising porcine insulin at a concentration of 129 μΜ and the compatible solutes at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.25 M were made. The increase in melting temperature observed for each solute at 0.1 M and 0.25 M is shown in Figure 11. All six solutes stabilized porcine insulin at both concentrations tested, with glucosyl glycolate and glucosyl malate providing the highest increases in melting temperature. Discussion The effectiveness of the new compounds in the protection of model proteins against heat-induced inactivation was assessed using DSF, and compared with the effect of natural solutes, like MG and GG as well as potassium chloride, and other previously synthesised non-natural solutes, like MGlyc and ML. DSF proved to be an excellent high-throughput method to obtain rapid information about the stabilising properties of the molecules . Analysis of the results obtained showed that the stabilisation effect is not general, and strongly depends on specific protein-solute interactions . Although some solutes showed superior thermostabilisation properties, the degree of stabilisation is different for each protein. The presence of charge is one the most important features for the stabilisation effect. Uncharged solutes, like the glucosamine cyclic derivatives, gave the lowest stabilisation, and malate derivatives, bearing a double charge, were the best stabilisers. Concerning the use of different hexoses, glucose and galactose derivatives were better stabilisers than the respective mannose and N-acetylglucosamine derivatives. However, the results showed that the group attached to the sugar had more influence for the stabilisation effect than the nature of the sugar . The results obtained with the a and β anomers of galactosyl glycerates showed that the a derivatives were better stabilisers . It is expected that the new compounds described herein will stabilize additional proteins as well as other biological materials. Thus, the new compounds of the invention are useful for the stabilization of biological materials used in pharmaceuticals, e.g. biologies . such as antibodies and hormones, cosmetics, food products, etc. The compounds of the invention can be used to protect biological materials against temperature stress, aggregation, and high salinity. For example, compounds of the invention can be used to stabilize biologies during processing, e.g. purification, formulation and/or drying, transportation, and storage.
