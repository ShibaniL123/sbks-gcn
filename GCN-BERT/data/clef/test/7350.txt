Step 8: Preparation of (S)-4-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one
72 mg (0.127 mmol) of (S)-4-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one prepared in step 7 was dissolved in 1 mL of dichloromethane, to which 1 mL of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and 0.5 mL of methanesulfonic acid were added, followed by stirring at 70Â° C. for 10 hours. Saturated sodiumbicarbonate aqueous solution was added thereto, followed by neutralization. Dichloromethane and water were added thereto, followed by extraction. The extracted organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: dichloromethane/methanol, 30/1) to give 51 mg of the target compound (S)-4-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one as a pale yellow solid (0.115 mmol, yield: 90%).
