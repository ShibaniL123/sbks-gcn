Technical Field The present invention relates to an agent for improving alkali tolerance of a plant, and to a method for improving alkali tolerance of a plant through treatment with the agent. Background Art Hitherto, in order to support explosively increasing population, humankind has continuously reclaimed land and improved agricultural techniques. As a result, most of the land of good soil which allows farming has already been cultivated. Thus, urgent and keen demand has arisen for development of a technique that overcomes poor soil conditions to realize agricultural production. One of the most common poor soil conditions is alkaline soil. In fact, a vast area of land of alkaline soil in the world remains uncultivated. Greening of alkaline soil areas is important for protecting the global environment as well as for agricultural production. There have been known methods for the melioration of alkaline soil, such as replacement of soil (soil dressing), washing out salts - because they make the soil alkaline-with a large amount of water (leaching), and treatment with acid or sulfur (neutralization). However, these methods have drawbacks. For example, soil dressing, the cost of which is very high, cannot be applied to a large area, and treatment of discharged soil is problematic. Leaching is not realistic, since alkaline soil is distributed mainly in dry areas. Neutralization with acid or sulfur is effective for weakly alkaline soil, but when this technique is applied to strongly alkaline soil, they remains a problem that plant growth is not promoted in the improved soil, although alkalinity of the soil is mitigated. Basically, these techniques are physicochemical treatments for soil and are not applied to plants themselves. Under such circumstances, demand has arisen for the development of an agent for improving alkali tolerance which directly acts on a plant to improve alkali tolerance thereof, and for a method for improving alkali tolerance of a plant employing such an agent for improving,alkali tolerance. Meanwhile, 5-aminolevulinic acid, a derivative thereof, and a salt of either of these are known to promote plant growth and to improve cold resistance (Patent Document 1), and also to improve plant growth under low-luminance conditions (Patent Document 2). Also known is a technique of improving salt tolerance of plant by use of these compounds for solving the problem of poor soil (Patent Document 3). Furthermore, spraying of 5-aminolevulinic acid is known to prevent decrease in foliage yield of plants grown in alkaline soil (Non-Patent Document 1).Yoshida et al. The Hokuriku Crop Science, no. 39, 31 March 2004, pages 66-68 describes the effect of foliar application of a combination of 5-aminolevulinic acid and micro elements on the yield of Komatsuna. Mitchell et al. "Soil acidity and liming - Part 2", http://hubcap.clemson.edu/-blpprt/lowerpH.html relates to the lowering of soil pH. [Patent Document 1] JP-A-1992-338305[Patent Document 2] JP-A-1995-184479[Patent Document 3] JP-A-1996-151304[Non-Patent Document 1] Conference Record, The Japanese Society for Chemical Regulation of Plants, 37: 87-88, 2002 Disclosure of the Invention Problems to be Solved by the Invention However, the effect of 5-aminolevulinic acid alone on improving alkali tolerance is insufficient, and the way in which 5-aminolevulinic acid is involved in plant growth under strongly alkaline soil conditions has never been known. Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide an agent and a method for improving alkali tolerance of plant. Means for Solving the Problems The aforementioned Non-Document 1 discloses spraying of 5-aminolevulinic acid in combination with an iron chelate. According to the disclosure, the foliage yield of plant in the combined spray area is lower than that in a water-treated area without spraying thereof, indicating that spraying the two species in combination exhibits no effect on improvement of alkali tolerance. The present inventors have carried out extensive studies on alkali damage to plants, and have found that a combination of 5-aminolevulinic acid, a derivative thereof, or a salt of either of these with a specific amount of an iron compound remarkably improves alkali tolerance of a plant grown in strongly alkaline soil. The present inventors have also found that the alkali tolerance is further improved through further adding elemental sulfur to the combination. The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of these findings. Accordingly, the present invention provides an agent for improving alkali tolerance of a plant, comprising: (i) 5-aminolevulinic acid or a derivative thereof represented by the following formula (1): R2R1NCH2COCH2CH2COR3 (1) wherein each of R1 and R2 represents a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, an acyl group, an alkoxycarbonyl group, an aryl group, or an aralkyl group, and R3 represents a hydroxy group, an alkoxy group, an acyloxy group, an alkoxycarbonyloxy group, an aryloxy group, an aralkyloxy group, or an amino group, or a salt of either of these;(ii) an iron compound; and(iii) elemental sulfur. The present invention also provides a method for improving alkali tolerance of a plant, characterized by treating a plant, or soil or a medium in which the plant grows with the agent for improving alkali tolerance of a plant. Effects of the Invention According to the present invention, alkali tolerance of a plant can be improved, whereby agricultural production in strongly alkaline soil and greening of alkaline soil can be realized. Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention As used herein, the term "alkaline conditions" refers to conditions where a plant is damaged with alkali. The soil under the conditions is referred to as "alkaline soil." Strictly speaking, the definition of alkaline soil is varied in accordance with the type of plant, and the alkaline soil is not defined strictly by the pH of the soil. However, generally, soil having a pH of 7 or higher, under which many plants are damaged, is called "alkaline soil," and that having a pH of 8 or higher, particularly 8.5 or higher, is called "strongly alkaline soil." The agent for improving alkali tolerance of the present invention exhibits a remarkable effect at a pH of 7 or higher, preferably 7.5 or higher, more preferably 8 or higher, still more preferably 8.5 or higher, particularly preferably 8.8 or higher. The upper limit of the pH is preferably 13. However, as mentioned above, the rigorous definition of alkaline soil varies in accordance with the type of plant and therefore, alkaline conditions cannot be determined for all the plants. For the sake of understanding the concept of "alkaline conditions," some examples will be given below. Spinach: Spinach is an alkalophilic plant, and the optimum pH of the soil for growth thereof is about 7.5. Although the soil having such a pH is "alkaline soil" for many plants, spinach grows most vitally at that pH. However, when the pH of the soil is in excess of 8, the growth of spinach is considerably impaired, resulting in diminishing green color of foliage. That is, the alkaline soil for spinach has a pH of 8 or higher, which is higher than the alkaline pH for many plants. Blueberry: Blueberry is an acidophilic plant, and the optimum pH of the soil for growth thereof is about 5.5. Blueberry is alkali-damaged even in soil having a pH of 6.5, which is preferred for many plants, and suppression of growth and yellowing of foliage are observed. That is, the alkaline soil for blueberry has a pH of 6.5 or higher, which is lower than the pH for many plants.

The agent for improving alkali tolerance of the present invention may be applied to a plant in foliage treatment (as a foliage treatment agent), soil treatment (as a soil treatment agent), or aerosol treatment (as an aerosol treatment agent). Particularly when the agent for improving alkali tolerance of the present invention containing elemental sulfur is applied to a plant, the agent is preferably applied in soil treatment (soil treatment agent). Alternatively, the agent of the present invention may be absorbed by a plant before planting, cutting, etc. of the plant. The agent may be added to water for hydroponic culture. Regardless of the presence of elemental sulfur, the agent for improving alkali tolerance of the present invention may be applied a plurality of times to a plant, or to soil or a medium in which the plant grows. The ingredients, 5-aminolevulinic acid, a derivative thereof, a salt of either of these, an iron compound, and elemental sulfur may be applied separately. In this case, the same application method or different methods may be employed. No particular limitation is imposed on the sequence and intervals of application of the agent for improving alkali tolerance and elemental sulfur, and each ingredient may be applied a plurality of times. Hereinafter, the modes of use of the agent for improving alkali tolerance will be described. Although the amount of ingredients is on the basis of 5-aminolevulinic acid or a similar compound, an iron compound and, furthermore, elemental sulfur are preferably used at the aforementioned proportions. When the agent for improving alkali tolerance of the present invention is used as a foliage treatment agent, 5-aminolevulinic acid, a derivative thereof, or a salt of either of these is added to a solvent at a concentration of 0.1 to 1,000 ppm, preferably 0.5 to 500 ppm, more preferably 0.5 to 300 ppm, and the thus-obtained liquid agent is used 10 to 1,000 L per 10 ares, more preferably 50 to 300 L. In the case where the agent is applied to a plant having foliage to which the agent is difficult to adhere (e.g., monocot), a wetting agent is preferably used in combination. No particular limitation is imposed on the type and amount of the wetting agent. When the agent for improving alkali tolerance of the present invention is used as a soil treatment agent, the agent (as 5-aminolevulinic acid, a derivative thereof, or a salt of either of these) is preferably used 1 to 1,000 g per 10 ares, more preferably 10 to 500 g. In the case of hydroponic culture, the amount is preferably a half thereof. When the agent for improving alkali tolerance of the present invention is used as an aerosol treatment agent, the agent (as 5-aminolevulinic acid, a derivative thereof, or a salt of either of these) is added to a solvent at a concentration of 0.1 to 1,000 ppm, preferably 0.5 to 500 ppm, and the thus-obtained liquid agent is used 10 to 1,000 L per 10 ares, more preferably 50 to 300 L. In the case in which a plant is immersed in a liquid of the agent for improving alkali tolerance of the present invention (5-aminolevulinic acid, a derivative thereof, or a salt of either of these) to absorb the agent before planting, the liquid of the agent (5-aminolevulinic acid, a derivative thereof, or a salt of either of these) preferably has a concentration of 0.001 to 10 ppm, more preferably 0.01 to 5 ppm. The immersion time is preferably one hour to one week, more preferably three hours to one day. Any of the above treatment methods is effective when it is performed in any phase of plant growth. Particularly, a remarkable effect can be attained when any treatment method is performed in a seedling state or a fruit maturity stage. Each treatment method provides a sufficient effect by a single treatment. However, through performing any of the treatment methods a plurality of times, the effect is more enhanced. When treatment is performed a plurality of times, the aforementioned treatment methods may be combined. When the agent for improving alkali tolerance of the present invention is employed in a mixture with a pesticide, fertilizer, etc. for the purpose of convenience, any kind of material may be mixed with the agent, so long as the effect of the present invention is not impaired. Examples The present invention will next be described in detail by way of examples, which should not be construed as limiting the invention thereto. Example 1 to 6 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3 Each of the pots (1/5000 a) was filled with andosols soil, and Komatsuna (species: Calvita, product of Nohara Seed Co., Ltd.) was sown in the soil. At the 3 leaf stage, five uniform seedlings per pot were selected by cutting. An aqueous solution (0.05 wt.%) of each agent having a composition shown in Table 1 was applied to the stems and leaves of the plants in each pot (5 mL/pot). Sulfur powder ("sulfur, powder," product of Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) was separately used in an amount given in Table 1 for soil treatment. The same sulfur powder was employed in the following Examples. Three days after the treatment, subirrigation was performed with a 0.5-mol/L aqueous sodium carbonate/sodium hydrogencarbonate buffer (pH: 9.0). One week after irrigation, the fresh weight of shoots of the plants was measured so as to check the growth conditions. Table 1 shows the results. In Comparative Example 1, water was employed instead of an aqueous solution of each agent. Examples 1 to 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21 and 23 are reference examples.

Particularly when an Fe-chelate such as Fe-EDTA or Fe-DTPA was used in combination, these effects were remarkably attained. Furthermore, when sulfur was additionally employed, the alkali tolerance of the plant was further improved, and alkali damage was more effectively prevented. Example 7 Calcium carbonate was added to field soil so as to adjust the Ca content to 5 mass%, and an appropriate amount of aqueous sodium carbonate solution was added thereto, followed by sufficiently mixing, to thereby provide alkaline soil (pH: 8.8). A chemical fertilizer (base fertilizer) was added to the alkaline soil in an amount of 10 kg/10 a (as reduced to N). Each of the pots (1/5000 a) was filled with the above soil, and 10 seeds of Komatsuna (Calvita, product of Nohara Seed Co., Ltd.) were sown in the soil, followed by cultivation in a greenhouse. Ten days after, five uniform seedlings per pot were selected by cutting. After cutting, an aqueous solution (0.05 mass%) of each agent having a composition shown in Table 2 was sprayed every 2 weeks to the stems and leaves of the plants in each pot (5 mL/pot), and the pot was controlled under ordinary conditions. Twenty-seven days after sowing, the soil was washed out with water, whereby the plants were harvested. The plant height of each plant was measured. Subsequently, the plants were dried at 80°C for 24 hours by a drier, and the dry weight of shoots of each plant was measured. The averaged values and test conditions are shown in Table 2. Example 8 The test procedure of Example 7 was repeated, except that the amounts of ingredients were changed. The results are shown in Table 2. Example 9 The test procedure of Example 7 was repeated, except that application of sulfur to soil treatment and application of other agent ingredients to foliage treatment were simultaneously performed. The results are shown in Table 2. Comparative Example 4 The test procedure of Example 7 was repeated, except that no agent treatment was performed. The results are shown in Table 2. Comparative Example 5 The test procedure of Example 7 was repeated, except that the agent was changed. The results are shown in Table 2.

As compared with Comparative Example 5 (treated with 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride alone), the effect of the present invention was found to be completely different from the known plant-growth promotion effect of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride. As compared with Examples 7 and 8, a more remarkable effect of improving alkali tolerance was attained in strongly alkaline soil by adding a specific amount of an iron compound to 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride. Furthermore, through combination with sulfur, a remarkable effect of improving alkali tolerance of a plant, which was synergistic with the effect of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride, was observed. Example 10 The test procedure of Example 7 was repeated, except that soil (pH of 7.6) was prepared. The results are shown in Table 3. Example 11 The test procedure of Example 10 was repeated, except that the amounts of ingredients were changed. The results are shown in Table 3.
