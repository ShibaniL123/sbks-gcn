3-(bromomethyl)-5-(tert-butyl)-2-methoxypyridine
(5-(tert-Butyl)-2-methoxypyridin-3-yl)methanol (0.502 g, 2.57 mmol) and triphenylphosphine (1.349 g, 5.14 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (12.85 mL). N-Bromosuccinimide (0.915 g, 5.14 mmol) was added in several portions and an exotherm/bubbling were noted (temp did not exceed 23° C.). After stirring for 15 minutes, the reaction was quenched by adding 5 mL of water. The mixture was stirred for 5 minutes and the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed twice with water, and filtered through a fritted cartridge layered with a pad of silica (2 cm), eluting with heptanes. The filtrates were concentrated, triturated with 50:50 methyl tert-butyl ether:heptanes, and filtered. The solid was washed with 50:50 methyl tert-butyl ether/heptanes (2×10 mL) and the solvent was removed in vacuo to provide 3-(bromomethyl)-5-(tert-butyl)-2-methoxypyridine (0.582 g, 2.254 mmol, 88% yield).
