PRODUCTION OF LACTIC ACID FROM ORGANIC WASTE OR BIOGAS OR METHANE USING RECOMBINANT METHANOTROPHIC BACTERIA FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure relates to the field of waste management, and more particularly relates to converting organic waste to lactic acid by employing recombinant methanotrophic bacteria. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Most modern cities are battling with increasing amount of garbage/waste generated and accumulated on a daily basis. Effective ways of managing the waste has become indispensable for maintaining sanitation and general quality of urban life. Sustainable and innovative solutions for managing waste are a critical need. There are various modes of waste disposal known to us such as landfills, incineration, recycling, biological reprocessing etc. The most acceptable and sustainable modes of waste management are recycling and reprocessing for resource and energy recovery. In recycling, materials generally undergo a chemical transformation and resultant products are recycled to be used for various purposes. For the purpose of resource recovery the organic waste is preferably anaerobically digested (also called Anaerobic Composting or Biomethanation) as compared to aerobic digestion to obtain compost which can be used as an organic fertilizer on agricultural fields. Anaerobic digestion of organic waste results in energy in the form of biogas, and compost in the form of a liquid residual. The biogas consists of methane and carbon dioxide and can be used as fuel or, by using a generator, it can be converted to electricity on-site. This reduces greenhouse gas emissions by using methane as an energy source which would otherwise be emitted from landfilling waste. Landfilling waste gas is similar in composition to biogas with lower amount of methane and differences in component gases. However, the conversion of biogas to i electricity is not economically attractive and also results in significant loss of energy during conversion. Methane, present in biogas or landfill gas, can also be converted to syngas and then to chemicals such as methanol. This gas to liquid conversion, however, happens at high temperature and pressure necessitating huge capital investments. Efficient utilization of biogas as well as methane has always been a challenging task. Advances in biotechnology are enabling development of new and improved microorganisms for efficient degradation of biomass. However, the existing state of the art does not provide for a unified and efficient way of converting organic wastes and more specifically biogas or methane to target chemicals by employing recombinant microorganisms. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure overcomes above mentioned drawbacks by developing recombinant methanotrophic bacteria for converting organic waste to lactic acid and providing method of using the recombinant microorganisms for converting organic waste and specifically biogas and methane to lactic acid thereby providing an environment-friendly and commercially viable solution for waste management. In one aspect of the present invention, a recombinant methanotrophic bacterium capable of producing lactic acid from organic waste or biogas or methane is provided. The recombinant methanotrophic bacterium includes a heterologous nucleic acid or gene encoding for lactate dehydrogenase (Idh) enzyme which is selected from sequences set forth as SEQ ID NOs.1 , 3, 5, or a combination thereof. In further aspect of the present invention, the recombinant methanotrophic bacterium with increased capacity of producing lactic acid over basal level is provided. The recombinant methanotrophic bacterium further includes gene(s) encoding enzyme(s) which are overexpressed, down-regulated or deleted or any combination thereof for increasing production of the lactic acid. in another aspect of the present invention, a process for producing lactic acid from organic waste using the recombinant methanotrophic bacterium is provided. The said process includes steps of receiving organic waste as input, anaerobically digesting the organic waste to biogas, culturing the bacterium in the biogas so generated thereby converting the biogas to the lactic acid, and optionally purifying or separating the lactic acid produced from the culture for obtaining the lactic acid. In yet another aspect of the present invention, an alternative process for producing lactic acid from a carbon source using recombinant methanotrophic bacterium is provided. The said process includes steps of receiving biogas and/or methane as carbon source as input, culturing the bacterium in the input, thereby converting the input into lactic acid, and optionally purifying or separating the lactic acid produced from the culture for obtaining the lactic acid. Other features of the embodiments will be apparent from the accompanying drawings and from the detailed description that follows.

The term "methanotrophs" or "methanotrophic bacteria" as used herein refers to bacteria that utilize methane as a source of carbon and energy. 210 These bacteria are widely present in nature can be found in areas of high methane content such as oceans, mud, marshes, underground environments, soils, rice paddies and landfills. Some of these are obligate and can only use methane as a source of carbon and energy. Some of these are facultative and are known to additionally use other substrates 215 such as succinate, acetate, pyruvate etc. The terms "LDH" and "lactate dehydrogenase" are used interchangeably herein and used to refer to an enzyme having lactate dehydrogenase activity. An enzyme with lactate dehydrogenase activity catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. The lactate dehydrogenase is a L-LDH or 220 D-LDH if it catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to L-lactate or pyruvate to D-lactate respectively. The term "organic waste" herein refers to the components of waste that can be broken down into its base components in a reasonable amount of time by micro-organisms. Organic waste can be found in commonly occurring 225 sources of waste such as municipal solid waste, green waste, food waste, paper waste, biodegradable waste, human waste, sewage, manure and slaughterhouse waste. The term "Anaerobic digestion" as used herein refers to a set of processes wherein several types of microorganisms break down biodegradable 230 material in the absence of oxygen. The end products are a gas comprising mostly methane and carbon dioxide, referred to as biogas, and a slurry or solid fraction, referred to as digestate. Different technologies are available for anaerobic digestion that vary in the process and process parameters affecting digestion. 235 The term "biogas" as used herein refers to the major product resulting from anaerobic digestion of waste. Typical composition of biogas is methane (50-75%), carbon dioxide (25-50%), nitrogen (0-10%), hydrogen (0-1%), hydrogen Sulphide (0-3%), oxygen (0-2%) and water vapour (3-5%). The biogas composition can vary depending on, among other factors, the type 240 of waste, its organic matter load, feeding rate of digester and conditions of anaerobic digestion. Biogas is typically lighter than air and produces less calories by combustion compared to equal volume of natural gas. Biogas is typically used for heating, generating electricity or as cooking fuel. The phrases "biogas cleaning" or "biogas upgrading" or "biogas scrubbing" 245 as used herein refers to the process of removing the non-methane components of biogas. Depending on the use of the biogas, the extent of biogas cleaning can vary. Different methods of cleaning the various non- methane components of biogas are known and practiced. Hydrogen Sulphide can be removed by among others biological fixation by using iron 250 oxidizing bacteria, dosing with iron chloride, water scrubbing, absorption activated carbon or bubbling through sodium hydroxide. Water vapor present in biogas can be removed by among others passive cooling, refrigeration, absorption into a drying medium, or adsorption into silica gel. Ammonia present in the biogas is usually in very low amounts and can be 255 removed by water scrubbing. Oxygen and nitrogen are typically not present in large amounts in biogas and can be removed by adsorption with activated carbon, molecular sieves or membranes. "Biogas upgrading" more typically refers to the removal of carbon dioxide from the biogas to increase the energy content of the gas. Some technologies for removing 260 carbon dioxide are commercially available and some are at the pilot or demo scale. Pressure swing adsorption is a process wherein the carbon dioxide can be removed by adsorption onto materials like activated carbon or zeolites under elevated pressure. Another method is removal of carbon dioxide by absorption. This is usually done by a counter current flow of 265 biogas with a liquid in a column filled with plastic packaging. Absorption can be done using water, organic solvents or amine solutions. Another classical method used is membrane separation using materials that are permeable to carbon dioxide, water and ammonia. The present invention discloses an eco-friendly way of handling the organic 270 waste and producing commercially useful chemicals from the same by using recombinant methanotrophic bacteria. The present invention provides recombinant methanotrophic bacteria capable of producing lactic acid from biogas or methane. The said recombinant methanotrophic bacteria include a heterologous nucleic acid or 275 gene encoding for lactate dehydrogenase (Idh) enzyme. The methanotrophs or methanotrophic bacteria are chosen for the present invention because they are unique in their ability to utilize methane as a sole carbon and energy source (Hanson, R. S., & Hanson, T. E., Methanotrophic bacteria. Microbiological Reviews, 60(2), pp 439- 280 471 (1996)). However, methanotrophs are not well established industrial hosts. They are present in a wide variety of environments and play a critical role in the oxidation of methane in the natural world The methanotrophs are classified into two major groups based on the pathways used for assimilation of formaldehyde, the major source of cell carbon, and other 285 physiological and morphological features. Type I methanotrophs employ the RuMP pathway for formaldehyde assimilation, whereas type II methanotrophs employ the serine pathway for formaldehyde assimilation. The use of enzymes known as methane monooxygenases - MMOs (EC 1.14.13.25)- to catalyze the oxidation of methane to methanol is a 290 defining characteristic of methanotrophs. The oxidation of methane by aerobic methanotrophs is initiated by MMOs utilizing two reducing equivalents to split the O-O bonds of dioxygen. One of the oxygen atoms is reduced to form H2O, and the other is incorporated into methane to form CH3OH (methanol). Two forms of MMOs have been found in 295 methanotrophic bacteria, a soluble form (sMMO) and a membrane bound form, pMMO. Methanol is oxidized to formaldehyde by methanol dehydrogenase (MDH), an enzyme that's highly expressed in most methanotrophs. The further oxidation of formaldehyde to carbon dioxide via formate provides most of the reducing power required for the oxidation of 300 methane. Multiple enzymes are known that catalyze the oxidation of formaldehyde to formate. The further oxidation of formate to carbon dioxide is catalyzed by an NAD-dependent formate dehydrogenase. Formaldehyde, produced from the oxidation of methane and methanol by methanotrophic bacteria, is assimilated to form intermediates of the central metabolic routes 305 that are subsequently used for biosynthesis of cell material. The two known pathways used by methanotrophic bacteria for the synthesis of multicarbon compounds from formaldehyde are the serine pathway, in which 2 mol of formaldehyde and 1 mol of carbon dioxide are utilized to form a three- carbon intermediate, and the RuMP cycle for the assimilation of 3 mol of 310 formaldehyde to form a three-carbon intermediate of central metabolism. In one of the embodiments, the recombinant microorganism of the present invention is selected from a group of organisms comprising: Methylococcus capsulatus, Methylobacterium extorquens, Methylomicrobium album, Methylocapsa acidiphila, Methylobacterium organophilum, 315 Methylobacterium mesophilicum, Methylobacterium dichloromethanicum, Methylocella silvestris, Methylosinus trichosporium, Methylobacillus flagellatus KT, Methylibium petroleiphilum PM1, , Methylobacterium nodularis, Methylobacterium populi, Methylobacterium chloromethanicum, Methylacidiphilum infernorum V4, Methylophilus methylotrophus, 320 Methylomonas methanica, Methylobacterium rhodesianum MB 126, Methylobacter tundripaludum, Methylobacterium sp. 4-46, Methylovorus glucosetrophus SIP3-4, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Methylobacterium rhodesianum, Methylosinus sporium, Methylocella palustris, Methylobacterium fujisawaense, Methylocystis parvus, Methylovulum 325 miyakonense, Methylobacterium rhodinum, Methylocystis echinoides, Methylomonas rubra, Methylococcus thermophilus, Methylobacterium aminovorans, Methylobacterium thiocyanatum, Methylobacterium zatmanii, Acidithiobacillus ferrivorans, Methylobacterium aquaticum, Methylobacterium suomiense, Methylobacterium adhaesivum, 330 Methylobacterium podarium, Methylobacter whittenburyi, Crenothrix polyspora, Clonothrix fusca, Methylobacter bovis, Methylomonas aurantiaca, Methylomonas fodinarum, Methylobacterium variabile, Methylocystis minimus, Methylobacter vinelandii, Methylobacterium hispanicum, Methylomicrobium japanense, Methylococcaceae bacterium, 335 Methylosinus trichosporium Ob3b, and Methylocystis methanolicus. Some species of the methanotrophs including, but not limited to, Methylococcus capsulatus, Methylocella silvestris, Methylobacterium extorquens, Methylosinus trichosporium etc. are well-characterized and basic molecular biology tools for host manipulation have been developed 340 (http://www.methanotroph.org/wiki/genetics/). In one embodiment, the recombinant methanotrophic bacteria for producing lactic acid is created from the Methylococcus capsulatus. In an exemplary embodiment the recombinant methanotrophic bacteria for producing lactic acid is created from the Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath). 345 The recombinant methanotrophic bacteria comprise of methane oxidation pathway, pentose phosphate pathway, Entner-Duodoroff pathway, pathways for assimilation (serine and/or RuMP) and an exogenic nucleic acid encoding for lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. As a result, the provided recombinant methanotrophs are imparted with the capability to convert 350 methane to lactic acid at levels significantly higher than that produced in the wildtype strain. Expression of the heterologous genes may be accomplished by conventional molecular biology means (Green, M.R.; Sambrook, J (2001 ). Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y: Cold 355 Spring Harbor Laboratory). For example, the heterologous genes can be under the control of an inducible promoter or a constitutive promoter. The heterologous genes may either be integrated into a chromosome of the host microorganism, or exist as an extra-chromosomal genetic elements that can be stably passed on ("inherited") to daughter cells. Such extra- 360 chromosomal genetic elements (such as plasmids, BAC, YAC, etc.) may additionally contain selection markers that ensure the presence of such genetic elements in daughter cells. The heterologous nucleic acid or gene encoding for lactate dehydrogenase is from a micro-organism selected from a group consisting of E. coli, 365 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pectobacterium carotovorum. Table 1 enlists the SEQ ID Nos. of the gene and polypeptide coding for Idh and micro-oragnisms/hosts from where it was taken. Table 1 375 In one embodiment of the present invention, the heterologous nucleic acid or gene encoding for lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, included in the recombinant methanotrophic bacterium, is selected from sequences set forth as SEQ ID NO.1 , 3, 5, or a combination thereof. In an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the heterologous 380 nucleic acid or gene encoding for lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, included in the recombinant methanotrophic bacterium, is a Lactate dehydrogenase gene (SEQ ID NO. 1 ) taken from E.coli. The heterologous nucleic acid or gene encodes an amino acid sequence that is at least 80% identical to a reference amino acid of Escherichia coli. 385 The heterologous nucleic acid or gene encoding for the lactate dehydrogenase enzyme set forth as SEQ ID NO.1 , 3, and 5 has a corresponding amino acid sequence set forth as SEQ ID No: 2, 4, and 6. The heterologous nucleic acid encoding for the lactate dehydrogenase 390 enzyme comprises an amino acid sequence that is at least 80% identical to a reference amino acid sequence selected from a group consisting of SEQ ID Nos: 2, 4 and 6. The lactic acid is chiral and has two optical isomers. One is known as L(+) - lactic acid or (S)-lactic acid and the other, its mirror image, is D(-) -lactic 395 acid or (R)-lactic acid. For the production of D and L forms of Lactic acid, the enzymes involved are D-lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH) and L-lactate dehydrogenase (L-LDH), respectively. In one of the embodiments, lactate dehydrogenase enzyme included in the recombinant methanotrophic bacteria is D-lactate dehydrogenase or L- 400 lactate dehydrogenase. As a result of that the lactic acid produced by the recombinant methanotrophic bacteria is either D- Lactic acid or L-lactic acid depending on whether the gene encoding for the D-lactate dehydrogenase or L-lactate dehydrogenase is included. In one of the embodiments, the recombinant methanotrophic bacteria are 405 engineered to produce D-lactic acid. In an alternate embodiment, the recombinant methanotrophic bacteria are engineered to produce L-lactic acid. The present invention also provides for improving the production of lactic acid above basal levels achieved in the recombinant methanotrophic 410 bacteria. In one embodiment the lactic acid production in recombinant methanotrophic bacteria with heterologous lactate dehydrogenase is at least 5 fold higher than the wildtype methanotroph. In an exemplary embodiment, the lactic acid production in recombinant methanotrophic bacteria with heterologous lactate dehydrogenase having a gene sequence 415 set forth as SEQ ID NO.2 is at least 10 fold higher than the wildtype methanotroph. In another exemplary embodiment, the lactic acid production in the recombinant methanotrophic bacteria with heterologous lactate dehydrogenase having a gene sequence set forth as SEQ ID NO.1 is at least 20 fold higher than the wildtype methanotroph. 420 In one of the embodiments, improvement in production of lactic acid above basal levels is achieved in the recombinant methanotrophic bacteria capable of converting biogas or methane to lactic acid by overexpressing or/and down-regulating or/and deleting genes coding for key enzymes. The basal levels indicate amount of lactic acid produced by the recombinant 425 methanotrophic bacteria when fed with biogas or methane. In some embodiments the lactic acid is at least 5 fold higher than that in the wildtype strain. In other embodiments it is at least 10, 15 or 20 fold higher than the wildtype methanotroph strain. As used herein, the term "overexpress" is intended to encompass 430 increasing the expression or activity of a gene or protein to a level greater than the cell normally produces. It is intended that the term encompass overexpression of endogenous, as well as heterologous gene or proteins. Overexpression of genes or proteins can be done by conventional molecular biology methods. In some embodiments, the genes can be 435 overexpressed by introducing additional copies of the genes on the chromosome or extra-chromosomally on plasmids, BACs or YACs. In certain embodiments the expression can be increased by optimizing the nucleotide sequence for expression in the specific host such as through codon optimization. In other embodiments, the gene expression can be 440 increased by altering the promoter or ribosome binding site operably linked to the gene, in yet other embodiments the gene activity can be increased through mutations in the gene that enhance the enzymatic activity. The term "down-regulated" or "deleted" used herein with reference to a gene or protein, indicates any modification in the genome and/or proteome 445 of a microorganism that eliminates or reduces the biological activity of the gene, protein or enzyme either directly or indirectly. For example, deletion or downregulation of gene or protein can be performed by deleting or mutating a native or heterologous polynucleotide encoding for the gene or protein in the microorganism, by deleting or mutating a native or 450 heterologous polynucleotide encoding for an enzyme involved in the pathway for the synthesis of the gene or protein in the microorganism, by activating a further native or heterologous molecule that inhibits the expression of the gene or protein in the microorganism. In particular, in some embodiments inactivation of a gene or protein such as an enzyme 455 can be performed by deleting from the genome of the recombinant microorganism one or more endogenous genes encoding for the enzyme. For assembly of the constructs to enable overexpression or downregulation or deletion of specific gene, conventional molecular biology methods can be used (Green, M.R.; Sambrook, J (2001 ). Molecular cloning: a laboratory 460 manual. Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; Ellis, T., Adie, T., & Baldwin, G. S. (2011 ), DNA assembly for synthetic biology: from parts to pathways and beyond. Integrative Biology: Quantitative Biosciences from Nano to Macro, 3(2), 109-18). Assembly of DNA parts through restriction digestion and ligation is well-established and known to 465 those skilled in the art (Green, M.R.; Sambrook, J (2001 ). Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual. Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). Other methods that offer standardized, scarless, sequence independent, multi piece DNA assembly such as SLIC (Sequence and Ligation Independent Cloning), Gibson assembly, CPEC (Circular 470 Polymerase Extension Cloning) or SLiCE ( Sequence and Ligation Cloning Extract)have more recently been established (https://j5.jbei.org/j5manual/pages/22.html). In some embodiments, SLIC based assembly is used for generating DNA constructs or vectors for overexpression or downregulation or deletion. In other embodiments CPEC 475 is used for assembly of DNA constructs for overexpression, deletion or down-regulation. In further embodiments, methods such as site-directed mutagenesis, transposon mutagenesis, Crispr/Cas assisted genome engineering and recombineering can be used directly for overexpression, down-regulation or deletion of specific gene or protein. 480 In one embodiment, additional improvement in production of lactic acid above basal levels is achieved in the recombinant methanotrophic bacteria capable of converting biogas or methane to lactic acid by overexpressing genes encoding for enzymes which are selected from a group consisting of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (SEQ ID Nos. 23, 24), 485 glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (SEQ ID Nos. 11 ,12), 2,3- bisphosphoglycerate-independent phosphoglycerate mutase (SEQ ID Nos. 17,18), glycerate 2-kinase (SEQ ID Nos.19,20), hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (SEQ ID Nos.7, 8), Transaldolase (SEQ ID Nos.13,14), phosphor fructo kinase (SEQ ID Nos.9,10), 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-dependent 490 phosphoglycerate mutase (SEQ ID Nos. 5, 6), enolase (SEQ ID Nos.21 ,22), ribulose phosphate 3-epimerase (SEQ ID Nos.25,26) and methanol dehydrogenase (SEQ ID Nos.27,28,29,30) or any combination thereof.

The present invention further provides for a method of creating the said 505 recombinant methanotrophic bacteria for producing lactic acid. The recombinant methanotrophic bacteria are selected from the group of methanotrophs as detailed in the earlier part of the specification. In one of the embodiments, the recombinant methanotrophic bacteria for producing lactic acid is created from the Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath). 510 The gene encoding for lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, is conjugated into M. capsulatus. In the process, the gene encoding for lactate dehydrogenase enzyme from a suitable host is amplified from genomic DNA using primers flanked with one or more restriction enzymes. Alternately, the gene is synthesized together 515 with flanking sequences for one or more restriction enzymes. The said gene is restriction digested and ligated into a cloning vector to create a first construct for purpose of gene sequence verification, if the gene is amplified from genomic DNA. The said gene is restriction digested and ligated with a broad host range vector to create a second construct for expression in the 520 M. capsulatus. The first construct containing the heterologous lactate dehydrogenase gene is transformed into E.coli BL21 competent cells by chemical transformation. The transformants, from previous step, are selected so as to verify activity of the lactate dehydrogenase. The second construct is conjugated into the M. capsulatus(Bath) to obtain the 525 recombinant M. capsulatus. In one specific embodiment, lactate dehydrogenase gene (Genbank U36928.1 ; P52643; SEQ ID No. 1 ) from E.coli was amplified from genomic DNA using primers flanked with BamHI and Hindlll restriction enzymes. The amplified gene was restriction digested and cloned into BamHI and 530 Hindlll sites in the pET21a (Novagen Cat No: 69740-3CN) vector to create pSB101. The gene was then sequence verified. The cloned gene was re- amplified with primers with Sad and SphI overhangs. The amplified gene was restriction digested with Sacl and SphI and cloned into the Sacl/SpHI sites in the broad host range vector pMHA201 (from Prof.Colin Murrell, 535 University of Norwich), downstream of sigma 70 promoter, to create pSB102. pMHA201 (See AN and Murrell 2009,) is a plasmid with a broad range Origin of replication (OriV), Kanamycin resistance gene, Ampicillin resistance gene and OriT for conjugative transfer. Plasmid pSB102 was sequence verified. 540 Methanotroph strains were cultivated in nitrate mineral salt (NMS) medium (http://www.methanotroph.org/wiki/culturing-tips/).NMS agar plates were prepared with 1.5 % (w/v) Bacto agar. Antibiotics were added as required: Kanamycin (30 pg/ml) and Gentamicin (5 g/ml). Methanotrophs were typically grown in 250 ml conical flasks with 24/29 joint containing 50 ml 545 NMS medium. Flasks were sealed with suba-seals and gassed with 50 ml (i.e. -20 %) methane/carbon dioxide (95/5, v/v mix). Methanotrophs grown on NMS agar plates were incubated in gas-tight container under a methane/air/carbon dioxide atmosphere (50/45/5, by vol.) at the appropriate temperature. The gas was replenished every 2 days until colonies formed, 550 usually within 5-10 days. M.capsulatus (from Prof.Colin Murrell, University of Norwich) derived strains were incubated at 45°C. Conjugation of pSB102 into M.capsulatus was done based on the protocol described by Martin, H., & Murrell, J. C. (1995). Methane monooxygenase mutants of Methylosinus trichosporium constructed by marker-exchange mutagenesis. FEMS 555 Microbiology Letters, 127(3), pp 243-248. 30 mL of M.capsulatus culture was spun down and resuspended in 5mL of NMS media. 2 mL of E.coli S.17 lambda pir bearing the plasmid to be conjugated was spun down, washed with 1 mL of NMS and resuspended again in 1 mL of NMS. The two cultures were mixed and filtered onto a 0.2μ nitrocellulose membrane. 560 The membrane was placed on an NMS agar plate containing 0.02 % (w/v) proteose peptone and incubated for a duration of 24 hours at 37°C in a gas- tight container under a methane/air/carbon dioxide atmosphere (50/45/5, by vol.). Following incubation, the cells were washed with 1 ml NMS and collected by centrifugation (7,000 x g for 5 minutes). Aliquots (50-100 μΙ) of 565 the cells were spread onto NMS plates containing 30pg/ml kanamycin for plasmid selection and incubated at 45 °C in a gas-tight container under a methane/air/carbon dioxide atmosphere (50/45/5, by vol.). Colonies typically formed on the plates after 8-12 days. Colonies were re-streaked onto NMS agar plates with 30ug/ml of kanamycin to confirm the true 570 recombinant strains. The present invention also provides a process of organic waste management by using the recombinant methanotrophic bacteria. The process broadly involves (a) converting the waste to biogas by anaerobic digestion, (b) converting biogas to lactic acid by using the recombinant 575 microorganisms, or alternatively scrubbing the biogas so produced to have methane and then converting it to lactic acid by using the recombinant microorganisms. In one embodiment, biogas is used as an input for producing lactic acid by employing the recombinant methanotrophic bacteria. The method includes: 580 A. Anaerobically digesting organic waste to break it down to biogas via three distinct stages of hydrolysis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis. In the first stage, a group of microorganisms comprising fermentative bacteria, secreting enzymes (lipases, proteases, cellulases, amylases, etc.), hydrolyses polymeric materials to monomers such as sugars and amino acids. In the next stage, products of the first stage are subsequently converted by a second group of bacteria comprising acetogenic bacteria to simple organic acids, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. In the final stage, a third group of bacteria comprising methanogens converts carbon dioxide, hydrogen and acetate to methane. Various aspects of the process of breaking down of solid waste have been well-researched, stream lined, and solutions at various scales have been developed. The most valuable component of biogas is methane (CH4) which constitutes around 50-75%, the remaining portion comprises carbon dioxide (CO2) and small percentages of other gases. The overall process of anaerobic digestion and output varies depending on the size of plant, type of waste, process conditions for fermentation, type of fermentation process etc. B. Cleaning up the biogas to remove carbon dioxide and other impurities present in the gas. The cleaning further includes two steps- (i) cleaning of hydrogen sulphide (H2S), NH3, water vapour and other impurities, and (ii) removal of carbon dioxide. Methods employed for biogas purification include, but not limited to, chemical absorption, high pressure water scrubbing, pressure swing adsorption, cryogenic separation, and membrane separation. The steps employed are well-researched and optimised to achieve efficient purification. The main output from this process is the methane gas. C. Third step of the method plays most significant part where the methane gas is converted to lactic acid by using the recombinant methanotrophic bacteria capable of metabolising methane to produce lactic acid (non-native). The process of converting methane to lactic acid includes: (1 ) Conversion of methane to methanol involves oxidation of methane to methanol by the methane monooxygenase enzyme (EC number EC 1.14.13.25). As mentioned above the methane monooxygenases (MMOs) are unique enzymes that can catalyze the oxidation of methane in the presence of oxygen. (2) Conversion of methanol to formaldehyde involves oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde by methanol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.244). Gram negative methanotrophs have a periplasmic methanotroph that is cytochrome c dependent. Gram positive methanotrophs have a NAD dependent enzyme that catalyzes this step. (3) Conversion of formaldehyde to pyruvate via central carbon metabolism involving assimilation of formaldehyde into central carbon metabolism of the methanotrophs and conversion to pyruvate via the steps of the RuMP pathway or serine pathway. Formaldehyde is a key intermediate that gets assimilated into the central carbon metabolism. 4) Conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27/EC 1.1.1.28) - one of the key intermediates on central carbon metabolism is pyruvate, a hydroxy acid. Lactate dehydrogenase enzyme is not native to methanotrophs. Heterologous expression of lactate dehydrogenase is required for the conversion to lactate. 5) Separating and collecting the lactic acid so produced by the recombinant methanotrophic bacteria Suitable conditions for conversion of methane or biogas to lactic acid depend on the temperature optimum, pH optimum, and nutrient requirements of the host microorganism and are known by those skilled in the art. These culture conditions may be controlled by methods known by those skilled in the art. For example, M.capsulatus are typically grown at temperatures of about 37° C. to about 50° C and a pH of about pH 3.0 to 645 pH 7.0. Growth media used for M.capsulatus typically include nitrate mineral salts, ammonium mineral salts and other relevant minimal media that usually do not contain other sources of carbon. The temperature maintained throughout the step C where the methane gas is converted to lactic acid by using the recombinant methanotrophic bacteria is in the range 650 of 37 to 50°C. However, best results are obtained when the temperature maintained throughout the step C is 45°C. Further, the maintained pH is maintained throughout the step C in the range of about 3 to 7. However, the best results are obtained where the pH is maintained within the range of 4- 6. A dissolved oxygen concentration of <20% is preferably maintained 655 throughout the step C. In an alternate embodiment, biogas is directly used as input without cleaning up the biogas to remove carbon dioxide and other impurities, hence omitting the step B provided for the above described embodiment, for producing lactic acid by employing the recombinant microorganisms. 660 Depending on the type of substrates used, anaerobic digestion, biogas cleaning etc. the ratio of methane to carbon dioxide in the input may vary. In some embodiments the ratio of methane to carbon dioxide is 95%:5%. In other embodiments it can be 50% methane:50% carbon dioxide. In another alternate embodiment, the biogas used as the input has varying ratios of 665 methane to carbon dioxide such as, but not limited to, from 95% methane:5% C02 to 50% methane:50% CO2. In another embodiment, methane gas is used as an input for producing lactic acid by employing the recombinant methanotrophic bacteria. The process of converting methane to lactic acid includes: 670 (1 ) Conversion of methane to methanol involves oxidation of methane to methanol by the methane monooxygenase enzyme (EC number EC 1.14.13.25). As mentioned above the methane monooxygenases (MMOs) are unique enzymes that can catalyze the oxidation of methane in the presence of oxygen. 675 (2) Conversion of methanol to formaldehyde involves oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde by methanol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.244). Gram negative methanotrophs have a periplasmic methanotroph that is cytochrome c dependent. Gram positive methanotrophs have a NAD dependent enzyme that catalyzes this 680 step. (3) Conversion of formaldehyde to pyruvate via central carbon metabolism involving assimilation of formaldehyde into central carbon metabolism of the methanotrophs and conversion to pyruvate via the steps of the RuMP pathway or serine pathway. 685 Formaldehyde is a key intermediate that gets assimilated into the central carbon metabolism. 4) Conversion of pyruvate to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.27/EC 1.1.1.28) - one of the key intermediates on central carbon metabolism is pyruvate, a hydroxy acid. Lactate 690 dehydrogenase enzyme is not native to methanotrophs. Heterologous expression of lactate dehydrogenase is required for the conversion to lactate. 5) Separating and collecting the lactic acid so produced by the recombinant methanotrophic bacteria. 695 The temperature maintained throughout the process is in the range of 37 to 50°C. However, best results are obtained when the temperature maintained throughout the process is 45°C. Further, the maintained pH is maintained throughout is in the range of about 3 to 7. However, the best results are obtained where the pH is maintained within the range of 4-6. A dissolved 700 oxygen concentration of <20% is preferably maintained throughout. The lactic acid finds its use in various industries and commercially useful products. The L-Lactic acid is added into foods and beverages when a tart, acid taste is desired, and is commonly used as a non-volatile acidulant. Both D- and L-lactic acid are used as raw materials in the production of 705 compounds such as polylactides and biodegradable polymers/plastics, and applications also exist for these acids in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. The present invention provides a cradle to cradle environment-friendly and commercially viable solution for managing organic waste. The target chemical lactic acid, produced from the organic waste by employing the 710 recombinant microbes, is an excellent building block for manufacturing variety of commercially viable products including, but not limited to, biodegradable plastics. Poly Lactic Acid (PLA), biodegradable polymer of lactic acid, is a linear aliphatic polyester produced by poly-condensation of naturally produced lactic acid or by the catalytic ring opening of the lactide 715 group. The PLA could be an alternative to the conventional plastic materials. The PLA being biodegradable can be disposed in safe and ecologically sound manner, through disposal processes (waste management) like composting, soil application, and biological wastewater treatment. The by-products of the biodegradation process of compostable 720 polymers have very minimal environmental effects and are primarily water, CO2, and biomass similar to plant biomass. High production cost of the biodegradable polymers as compared to conventional plastics has been an inhibiting factor for extensive use of biodegradable polymers. It is of utmost importance, keeping environmental sustainability in mind, to implement 725 immediate use for biodegradable plastics in several areas such as industrial packaging, wrapping, milk sachets, foodservice, personal care, pharmaceuticals, surgical implants, medical devices, recreation, etc. The present invention brings down the overall cost of lactic acid production by using waste materials and hence production cost of PLA. The increase in 730 production and use of cheaper biodegradable plastic will effectively reduce the disposability problem associated with the use of conventional plastics broadly in two ways firstly, the waste biodegradable plastics do not create environmental hazard and can be converted to target chemicals which may be used again to produce useful products, and secondly, this also solves 735 the problem of segregating non-biodegradable and biodegradable materials in the waste stream of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW). EXAMPLES The present invention is explained further in the following specific examples 740 which are only by way of illustration and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. Example 1 : Cloning lactate dehydrogenase into a bacterial vector Lactate dehydrogenase gene (Genbank U36928.1 ; P52643; SEQ ID No. 1 ) from E.coli was amplified from genomic DNA using primers flanked with 745 BamH1 and Hindlll restriction enzymes. The amplified gene was restriction digested and cloned info BamHI and Hindlll sites in the pET21a (Novagen Cat No: 69740-3CN) vector to create pSB101. The gene was then sequence verified. The cloned gene was re-amplified with primers with Sad and Sphl 750 overhangs. The amplified gene was restriction digested with Sacl and Sphl and cloned into the Sacl/SpHI sites in the broad host range vector pMHA201 (From Prof.Colin Murrell, University of Norwich), downstream of sigma 70 promoter, to create pSB102. pMHA201 (Alit, H., & Murrell, J. C, Development and validation of promoter-probe vectors for the study of 755 methane monooxygenase gene expression in Methylococcus capsulatus Bath., Microbiology, 155(3), pp 761-771(2009); doi:10.1099/mic.0.021816- 0) is a plasmid with a broad range Origin of replication (OriV), Kanamycin resistance gene, Ampicillin resistance gene and OriT for conjugative transfer. Plasmid pSB102 (Figure 1) was sequence verified. 760 Example 2: Verification of activity of lactate dehydrogenase Vector pSB101 was transformed into E.coli BL21 competent cells (NEB, Cat. Num: 2530H) by chemical transformation. True transformants were selected by plating cells on LB agar plates containing 50ug/ml of kanamycin. 765 Single colonies of the true transformants were used to inoculate 5ml of LB media containing 50ug/ml of kanamycin in 50ml culture tubes. The cultures were incubated for a duration of 16 hours at 37°C at 200rpm. The cultures were used to inoculate 25ml LB media containing 50ug/ml of kanamycin in 100ml flasks at a ratio of 1 :1000. The cultures were incubated at 37°C at 770 200rpm. The culture was induced with 0.1 mM IPTG at an OD of 0.8. Samples were taken from the flasks at different time intervals (upto 24 hours) for lactic acid analysis. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000rpm for 20mins to separate the cells from the supernatant. The supernatant was analyzed for lactic acid levels. 775 Lactic acid was estimated by HPLC. Samples were run on a C18 column using 25mM phosphate buffer pH 2.8 and Acetonitrile at 95%:5% at 0.5ml/min. Lactic acid amounts was measured at 210 nm using standards. Induced samples showed atleast 20% higher amount of lactic acid compared to un-induced control samples (Figure 2). 780 Example 3: Conjugation of pSB102 into methanotroph strains Methanotroph strains were cultivated in nitrate mineral salt (NMS) medium. NMS medium was prepared following the protocol outlined at http://www.methanotroph.org/wiki/culturing-tips and included here. NMS agar plates were prepared with 1.5 % (w/v) Bacto agar. Antibiotics were 785 added as required: Kanamycin (30 pg/ml) and Gentamicin (5pg/ml). Methanotrophs were typically grown in 250 ml conical flasks with 24/29 joint containing 50 ml NMS medium. Flasks were sealed with suba-seals (Sigma Aldrich, Cat Num: Z279773-10EA) and gassed with 50 ml (i.e. -20 %) methane/carbon dioxide (95/5, v/v mix). M.capsulatus (From Prof.Colin 790 Murrell, University of Norwich) derived strains were incubated at 45°C with shaking at 200 rpm. M.trichosporium (From Prof.Colin Murrell, University of Norwich) derived strains were incubated at 30°C. A typical methanotrophic culture took about 4-6 days to reach stationary phase. Methanotrophs grown on NMS agar plates were incubated in gas-tight container under a 795 methane/air/carbon dioxide atmosphere (50/45/5, by vol.) at the appropriate temperature. The gas was replenished every 2 days until colonies formed, usually within 5-10 days depending on the strain. Conjugation of pSB102 into M.capsulatus was done based on the protocol described by Martin, H., & Murrell, J. C, Methane monooxygenase mutants 800 of Methylosinus trichosporium constructed by marker-exchange^ SSS). 30 mL of methanotroph culture was spun down and resuspended in 5mL of NMS media. 2 mL of E.coli S.17 lambda pir bearing the plasmid to be conjugated was spun down, washed with 1 mL of NMS and resuspended again in 1 mL of NMS. The two cultures were mixed and filtered onto a 0.2μ 805 nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was placed on an NMS agar plate containing 0.02 % (w/v) proteose peptone and incubated for a duration of 24 hours at 37 °C. Following incubation, the cells were washed with 1 ml NMS and collected by centrifugation (7,000 x g for 5 minutes). Aliquots (50-100 μΙ) of the cells 810 were spread onto NMS plates containing 30 g/ml kanamycin for plasmid selection and incubated at 45 °C in a gas-tight container under a methane/air/carbon dioxide atmosphere (50/45/5, by vol.). Colonies typically formed on the plates after 8-12 days. Colonies were re-streaked onto NMS agar plates with 30ug/ml of kanamycin to confirm the true 815 transformants. Example 4: Growth and assay of methane to lactic acid conversion Positive transformants of M.capsulatus containing pSB102 were verified by PCR. These were inoculated into 5ml of liquid NMS media taken in 30ml culture tubes and sealed with suba seals. 15ml of Methane mixture (95% 820 CH4; 5% CO2) was introduced into the culture tube using a syringe. The tubes were incubated at 45 °C at 200rpm agitation. Once the culture OD reached 1 , the cultures was centrifuged and the supernatant samples were taken and assayed for lactic acid. D-lactic acid was assayed using a kit (Megazyme International, K-DATE kit) according to manufacturer's 825 protocol. L-Lactic acid was assayed using a kit (Megazyme International, L- DATE kit) according to manufacturers' protocol. Methanotroph strains transformed with lactate dehydrogenase gene (STB1 ; SEQ ID 1 ) showed >20 fold higher levels of lactic acid compared to wildtype control (Control and STB1 in Figure 3). 830 Example 5: Growth and assay of methane to lactic acid conversion with different lactate dehydrogenases and varying promoters Lactate dehydrogenase genes from E.coli, P.aeruginosa (MTCC 424) and P.carotovorum (MTCC 1428) were amplified from the respective genomes, cloned under the control of methanol dehydrogenase promoter (PmxaF) or 835 an teste or methane to actic aci conversion. To clone PmxaF 840 promoter, the promoter was amplified from M.capsulatus and cloned into pMHA201 vector in place of the sigma 70 promoter using CPEC (Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning, See Quan and Tian 2009). Positive clones were verified by PCR. Six constructs (E.coli IdhA under PmxaF and σ70 promoter; P.aeroginosa 845 Idh under PmxaF and σ70 promoter and P.carotovorum Idh under PmxaF and σ70 promoter) were conjugated into M.capsulatus based on the protocol described by Martin & Murrell 1995. Positive transformants were selected on NMS plates with 30 g/ml of Kanamycin. Sequence verified clones were used to inoculate 5ml of NMS media 850 containing 30pg/ml of Kanamycin taken in 30ml culture tubes. The cultures tubes were sealed with suba seals. 15ml of Methane mixture (95% CH4; 5% CO2) was introduced into the culture tube using a syringe. The tubes were incubated at 45 °C at 200rpm agitation. Samples were taken at OD 1.0 and tested for lactic acid using Megazyme lactic acid assay kit according to 855 manufacturer's protocol. Figure 3 depicts the lactic acid production from the recombinant methanotroph strain with different heterologous lactate dehydrogenases . Recombinant methanotroph strains, except for STB6, had at least 5 fold higher lactic acid compared to control and as much as 20 fold higher lactic acid control when compared to control. Strains tested 860 were Control - wildtype M.capsulatus; STB1/STB4 - M.capsulatus with E.coli Idh cloned under sigma 70 and PmxaF; STB2/STB5- M.capsulatus with P. aeruginosa Idh under sigma 70 and PmxaF; STB3/STB6 - M.capsulatus with P.carotovorum Idh under sigma 70 and PmxaF. Example 6: Growth of methanotroph strains on biogas generated from 865 organic waste Methanotroph strain Methylococcus capsulatus was grown on methane and biogas to test the effect of biogas constituents on growth. Biogas used for this analysis was from an anaerobic digester that processes kitchen waste. Food waste was anaerobically digested using 870 BioOrja biomethanation reactor (GPS Renewables, Bangalore). Bioorja generates 70kg of LPG equivalent from 1 ton of food waste. The composition of the biogas was largely 60-65% CH4; 35-30% CO2; Traces - H2S; Traces- NH3. For comparative methane, a commercial mixture of 95% CH4: 5% CO2 was used. Nitrate mineral salts medium was used for strain 875 growth. The methanotroph strain, M.capsulatus, was inoculated into 5ml of NMS media taken in 30ml culture tubes. The tubes were sealed with suba seals. 15ml of methane or biogas was fed into the tubes using a syringe. The tubes were incubated at 45 °C at 200rpm agitation. Samples were taken from the tubes every 24 hours and cell growth was measured by 880 monitoring OD at 600nm.When growth was compared for M.capsulatus between biogas and methane, , the growth profile of the strain on biogas was similar to the growth profile on commercial methane mixture (Figure 4). Example 7: Growth and assay of biogas to lactic acid fermentation 885 The recombinant Methylococcus capsulatus with heterologous lactate dehydrogenase gene (SEQ ID No.1 ; Strain STB 4) was grown in biogas generated from organic waste and tested for conversion of biogas to lactic acid. Recombinant strain and control were inoculated in 5ml of NMS media 890 containing 30ug/ml of Kanamycin taken in 30ml culture tubes. The culture tubes were sealed with suba seals. 15ml of biogas was fed into the culture tubes using a syringe. Biogas used for this analysis was obtained from kitchen waste digested using the BioOrja reactor. The composition of the biogas was largely 60-65% CH4; 35-30% C02; Traces - H2S; Traces- NH3. 895 The cells were grown in conditions optimal for growth - 45°C and 200rpm. 0.1ml samples were taken at every 24 hours and measured for OD (600nm) and lactic acid levels. The samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was assayed for lactic acid using the Megazyme lactic acid kit according to manufacturer's protocol. Lactic acid levels in the recombinant strains 900 increase with time. Figure 5 shows the results for production of lactic acid from biogas. These studies were done with biogas without upgrading the biogas to remove carbon dioxide. Alternately, the biogas can be cleaned up to remove the carbon dioxide by having a basic purification unit in place. 905 Water scrubbing is a basic method used to remove the carbon dioxide. Pressurized biogas is fed to the bottom of a packed column where water is fed on the top and the absorption process is operated counter-currently. The cleaned up gas with >90% of methane can be used for growth of strains and lactic acid production. 910 Examples 8: Effect of pH on lactic acid production To test the effect of pH on lactic acid production, NMS media was prepared with different buffers. Standard NMS media widely used for methanotrophs growth uses phosphate buffer with a pH of 6.8. NMS media was prepared 915 at pH 4.1 , 4.8, 5.8 and 6.8 using acetate or phosphate buffers. NMS media at pH 4.1 and 4.8 was prepared using 50mM acetate buffer. NMS media at pH 5.8 and 6.8 was prepared using 50mM phosphate buffer. The recombinant Methylococcus capsulatus with heterologou 's lactate dehydrogenase gene expressed from a broad host range vector (STB4) 920 was inoculated into 5ml of each media taken in 30ml cultures tubes. The tubes were sealed with suba seal and fed with 15ml of methane mixture using a syringe every 24 hours. Samples were taken every 24 hours and tested for OD at 600nm. Samples were also centrifug.ed and the supernatant was assayed for lactic acid using the standard kifeaccording to 925 manufacturer's protocol. The pH of the base media had a distinct effect on the amount of lactic acid produced in the strain (Figure 6). At the pH of 5.8, the lactic acid production was at least 50% higher when compared to lactic acid production at pH 6.8. Example 9: Overexpression of genes for improved lactic acid 930 production Gene overexpression targets were cloned into the same base vector (pSB102) together with lactate dehydrogenase genes and expressed in Methylococcus capsulatus. In order to clone the additional genes into the vector, a σ54 promoter was amplified from M.capsulatus and cloned into 935 pSB102 downstream of the Idh gene using SLIC (Sequence and Ligation Independent Cloning, See Li & Elledge 2007; Figure 7). Overexpression gene targets (SEQ ID Nos: 6-15) were amplified from genomic DNA of either E.coli or M.capsulatus using a 15-20bp overlap to the vector sequence for cloning by SLIC. These were cloned into pSB102 940 using SLIC. Positive clones were confirmed by PCR. SLIC was done in a 10ul reaction according to the following set up: 50-1 OOng of vector; 200- 400ng of insert; 1X Buffer 2.1 (NEB); 0.3μΙ of T4 DNA Polymerase. All components except the enzyme was added and kept on ice for 5mins. The enzyme was added to the mixture, mixed well and incubated on ice for 945 10mins. 4ul of the reaction mixture was transformed into E.coli and selected on LB/Kan plates to select for true transformants. True transformants were confirmed by PCR. Confirmed vectors were purified from E.coli and conjugated into M.capsulatus using the method of Martin and Murrell as outlined above. 950 Positive transformants were selected on NMS agar plates with 30pg/ml of Kanamycin. To test the overexpression of the gene targets on lactic acid production, transformants were individually inoculated into 5ml of standard NMS media in 30ml cultures tubes together with a control strain that had only the lactate 955 dehydrogenase gene. The tubes were sealed with suba seal and fed with 15ml of methane mixture using a syringe. Tubes were incubated at 45°C with 200rom shaking. At the end of 72 hours, samples were taken and tested for OD at 600nm and lactic acid production. Samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was assayed for lactic acid using the 960 Megazyme standard kit according to manufacturer's protocol. Table 3 depicts the specific genes when overexpressed with lactate dehydrogenase result in higher levels of lactic acid. SEQ ID 1 when expressed separately in M.capsulatus results in at least 20 fold higher activity than the control strain (Fig.3). When SEQ ID 1 is combined with 11 , 17 or 23, a further at least 3 965 fold improvement in lactic acid levels are seen. Fold Improvement in lactic acid SEQ IDs in M.capsulatus SEQ ID 7 + SEQ ID 1 2.6 SEQ ID 11+ SEQ ID 1 3.2 SEQ ID 13 + SEQ ID 1 2.4 SEQ ID 15 + SEQ ID 1 1.2 SEQ ID 17 + SEQ ID 1 3 SEQ ID 19 + SEQ ID 1 2.6 SEQ ID 21 + SEQ ID 1 1.6 SEQ ID 23 + SEQ ID 1 3.8 SEQ ID 1 1 Table 3: Improved lactic acid production from gene overexpression of specific target genes 970 Example 10: Overexpression of genes for improved lactic acid production To further increase the lactic acid production, overexpression of 2 gene combinations together with lactate dehydrogenase were tested. To test for 2 gene combinations, the pmxaF promoter was introduced into 975 the overexpression base vector by SLIC. SLIC was done in a 10ul reaction according to the following set up: 50-1 OOng of vector; 200-400ng of insert; 1X Buffer 2.1 (NEB); 0.3ul of T4 DNA Polymerase. All components except the enzyme was added and kept on ice for 5mins. The enzyme was added to the mixture, mixed well and incubated on ice for 10mins. 4μΙ of the 980 reaction mixture was transformed into E.coli and selected on LB/Kan plates to select for true transformants. True transformants were confirmed by PCR. This allowed for an overexpression vector with lactate dehydrogenase cloned under sigma 70 and further two promoters (sigma 54 and pmxF) for 985 expression of other genes. To create combinations, the genes were amplified with 20bp overlap and introduced sequentially into the overexpression vector using SLIC. Vectors with varying gene combinations (SEQ ID 1 , 1 1 ,17; SEQ ID 1 ,' 1 1 , 23; SEQ ID 1 ,17,23) were generated by sequential introduction of the overexpression genes into the base vector. 990 True transformants were confirmed by PCR and isolated from E.coli. Confirmed vectors were purified from E.coli and conjugated into M.capsulatus using the method of Martin and Murrell as outlined above. Positive transformants were selected on NMS agar plates with 30ug/ml of Kanamycin. To test the overexpression of the gene targets on lactic acid 995 production, transformants were individually inoculated into 5ml of standard NMS media in 30ml cultures tubes together with a control strains that had only the lactate dehydrogenase gene and lactate dehydrogenase genes with the single gene targets. The tubes were sealed with suba seal and fed with 15ml of methane mixture using a syringe. Tubes were incubated at 1000 45°C with 200rom shaking. At the end of 72 hours, samples were taken and tested for OD at 600nm and lactic acid production. Samples were centrifuged and the supernatant was assayed for lactic acid using the Megazyme standard kit according to manufacturer's protocol. Recombinant strains that had 2 genes overexpressed had at least two fold 1005 and as much as 6 fold improved activity compared to single gene overexpression.
