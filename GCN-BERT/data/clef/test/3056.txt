CROSS-REFERENCE This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(e) to U.S. Provisional application Ser. No. 61/473,724, filed Apr. 8, 2011, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to new indolinone compounds which are effective in treating disorders related to abnormal VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), or VEGFR-2 (KDR) activities. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, methods of treating diseases utilizing pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and methods of preparing them are also disclosed. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1) activities have been linked to cell growth, differentiation and proliferation. The apparent link between VEGFR-1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1)-related cellular activities and human disorders had generated a great deal of effort to identify ways to modulate their activity and to identify small molecules which act as their inhibitors. For example, sunitinib from U.S. Pat. No. 6,573,293, was developed into a drug product with a tradename Sutent®. However, there are numerous side effects associated with sunitinib therapy, such as fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, hypertension, a yellow skin discoloration, hand-foot skin reaction, and stomatitis. Serious (grade 3 or 4) adverse events occur in up to 10% of patients and include hypertension, fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, and chemotherapy-induced acral erythema. Lab abnormalities associated with sunitinib therapy include lipase, amylase, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets. Hypothyroidism and reversible erythrocytosis have also been associated with sunitinib. Moreover, dose reductions were required in 50% of the patients studied in RCC in order to manage the significant toxicities of sunitinib and its efficacy at dose reduced sub-group has never been published. There is a need to develop new compounds with better toxicity and efficacy profiles for cancer treatment. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to new indolinone compounds which inhibit VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), and/or VEGFR-2 (KDR) and regulate disorders, such as cancer, related to VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), and/or VEGFR-2 (KDR). Accordingly, in one aspect, the present invention relates to new indolinones of Formula I: and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs; wherein R1 is selected from the group consisting of F, Cl, Br, CF3, CCl3, CN, SO2NHR, COR, CONHR and R; wherein R2=R; wherein X=CH or CR; wherein Y is O, NH or NR; wherein n=2-4; and wherein R is H, alkyl, aryl, alkoxy or aryloxy. In a second aspect, this invention is directed to a method of synthesizing the compound of formula I by reacting with to produce compound of formula I, wherein n=2-4. can be prepared by reacting with wherein n=2-4. In a third aspect, this invention is directed to a compound of formula II: and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof. Lastly, this invention is also directed to a method of treating or preventing a disorder related to VEGFR, such as VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), or VEGFR-2 (KDR). DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Definitions Unless otherwise stated the following terms used in the specification and claims have the meanings discussed below: “Alkyl” refers to a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical including straight chain and branched chain groups of 1 to 20 carbon atoms. The alkyl group may be substituted or unsubstituted. “Cycloalkyl” refers to a 3 to 8 member all-carbon monocyclic ring, an all-carbon 5-member/6-member or 6-member/6-member fused bicyclic ring or a multicyclic fused ring (a “fused” ring system means that each ring in the system shares an adjacent pair of carbon atoms with each other ring in the system) group wherein one or more of the rings may contain one or more double bonds but none of the rings has a completely conjugated pi-electron system. “Aryl” refers to an all-carbon monocyclic or fused-ring polycyclic (i.e., rings which share adjacent pairs of carbon atoms) groups of 1 to 12 carbon atoms having a completely conjugated pi-electron system. Examples, without limitation, of aryl groups are phenyl, naphthalenyl and anthracenyl. The aryl group may be substituted or unsubstituted. “Alkoxy” refers to both an —O-(unsubstituted alkyl) and an —O-(unsubstituted cycloalkyl) group. Representative examples include, but are not limited to, e.g., methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, butoxy, cyclopropyloxy, cyclobutyloxy, cyclopentyloxy, cyclohexyloxy, and the like. “Aryloxy” refers to both an —O-aryl and an —O-heteroaryl group, as defined herein. Representative examples include, but are not limited to, phenoxy, pyridinyloxy, furanyloxy, thienyloxy, pyrimidinyloxy, pyrazinyloxy, and the like, and derivatives thereof. “Halo” group refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine, preferably fluorine or chlorine. Compounds that have the same molecular formula but differ in the nature or sequence of bonding of their atoms or the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “isomers”. Isomers that differ in the arrangement of their atoms in space are termed “stereoisomers”. Stereoisomers that are not mirror images of one another are termed “diastereomers” and those that are non-superimposable mirror images of each other are termed “enantiomers”. When a compound has an asymmetric center, for example, it is bonded to four different groups, a pair of enantiomers is possible. An enantiomer can be characterized by the absolute configuration of its asymmetric center and is described by the R- and S-sequencing rules of Cahn and Prelog, or by the manner in which the molecule rotates the plane of polarized light and designated as dextrorotatory or levorotatory (i.e., as (+) or (−)-isomers respectively). A chiral compound can exist as either individual enantiomer or as a mixture thereof. A mixture containing equal proportions of the enantiomers is called a “racemic mixture”. The compounds of this invention may possess one or more asymmetric centers; such compounds can therefore be produced as individual (R)- or (S)-stereoisomers or as mixtures thereof. Unless indicated otherwise, the description or naming of a particular compound in the specification and claims is intended to include both individual enantiomers and mixtures, racemic or otherwise, thereof. The methods for the determination of stereochemistry and the separation of stereoisomers are well-known in the art (see discussion in Chapter 4 of “Advanced Organic Chemistry”, 4th edition J. March, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1992). The compounds of Formula I may exhibit the phenomena of tautomerism and structural isomerism. For example, the compounds described herein may adopt an E or a Z configuration about the double bond connecting the 2-indolinone moiety to the pyrrole moiety or they may be a mixture of E and Z. This invention encompasses any tautomeric or structural isomeric form and mixtures thereof which possess the ability to modulate VEGFR, such as VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), and/or VEGFR-2 (KDR) activity and is not limited to any one tautomeric or structural isomeric form. A “pharmaceutical composition” refers to a mixture of one or more of the compounds described herein, or physiologically/pharmaceutically acceptable salts or prodrugs thereof, with other chemical components, such as physiologically/pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and excipients. The purpose of a pharmaceutical composition is to facilitate administration of a compound to an organism. The compound of Formula I may also act as a prodrug. A “prodrug” refers to an agent which is converted into the parent drug in vivo. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent drug is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound of the present invention which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”) to facilitate transmittal across a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity, once inside the cell where water solubility is beneficial. Additionally, it is contemplated that a compound of Formula I would be metabolized by enzymes in the body of the organism such as human being to generate a metabolite that can modulate the activity of the protein kinases. Such metabolites are within the scope of the present invention. As used herein, a “physiologically/pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to a carrier or diluent that does not cause significant irritation to an organism and does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the administered compound. A “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” refers to an inert substance added to a pharmaceutical composition to further facilitate administration of a compound. Examples, without limitation, of excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars and types of starch, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, vegetable oils and polyethylene glycols. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the parent compound. “Method” refers to manners, means, techniques and procedures for accomplishing a given task including, but not limited to, those manners, means, techniques and procedures either known to, or readily developed from known manners, means, techniques and procedures by, practitioners of the chemical, pharmaceutical, biological, biochemical and medical arts. “Modulation” or “modulating” refers to the alteration of the catalytic activity of a receptor tyrosine kinase, VEGFR (or VGFR), including, but not limited to all three VEGFR (VGFR) isoforms identified in humans; VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), VEGFR-2 (KDR) and VEGFR-3 (Flt-4). “VEGFR” or “VGFR” refers to vascular endothelial growth factor, a member of the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor family. VEGF is believed to plan an essential role in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. “In vitro” refers to procedures performed in an artificial environment such as, e.g., without limitation, in a test tube or culture medium. “In vivo” refers to procedures performed within a living organism such as, without limitation, a mouse, rat or rabbit. “Treat”, “treating” and “treatment” refer to a method of alleviating or abrogating a PK mediated cellular disorder and/or its attendant symptoms. With regard particularly to cancer, these terms simply mean that the life expectancy of an individual affected with a cancer will be increased or that one or more of the symptoms of the disease will be reduced. “Organism” refers to any living entity comprised of at least one cell. A living organism can be as simple as, for example, a single eukaryotic cell or as complex as a mammal, including a human being. “Therapeutically effective amount” refers to that amount of the compound being administered which will relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms of the disorder being treated. In reference to the treatment of cancer, a therapeutically effective amount refers to that amount which has the effect of: (1) reducing the size of the tumor;(2) inhibiting (that is, slowing to some extent, preferably stopping) tumor metastasis;(3) inhibiting to some extent (that is, slowing to some extent, preferably stopping) tumor growth, and/or,(4) relieving to some extent (or, preferably, eliminating) one or more symptoms associated with the cancer.
