Step 7: preparation of intermediate triphenyl-[(E)-prop-1-enyl]phosphonium [trans-2-[(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)methyl]-4-oxazol-5-yl-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-6-yl] sulfate (1 h)
To a solution of tert-butyl N-[[trans-6-allyloxy-4-oxazol-5-yl-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-2-yl]methyl]carbamate (1g) (440 mg, 1.17 mmol) and glacial acetic acid (134 ÂµL, 2.34 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (13 mL) was added in one portion Pd(PPh3)4 (675 mg, 0.58 mmol). After stirring for 2 h, a solution of sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (753 mg, 4.73 mmol) in dry pyridine (15 mL) was added and the resulting mixture was stirred overnight. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo, diluted with DCM and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated in vacuo. The crude was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (DCM/acetone 97/3 to 20/80) to give triphenyl-[(E)-prop-1-enyl]phosphonium [trans-2-[(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)methyl]-4-oxazol-5-yl-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-6-yl] sulfate (1 h) (560 mg, 0.78 mmol, 67%).
