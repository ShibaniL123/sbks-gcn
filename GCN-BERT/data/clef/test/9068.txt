(6S,8R)-6-(5-bromo-3-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-1-fluoro-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline
Trifluoroacetic acid (2.16 mL) was added to a solution of (R)-1-(3-fluoro-1H-indazol-4-yl)-N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)propan-2-amine (2.50 g, 9.08 mmol) and 5-bromo-3-fluoropicolinaldehyde (1.85 g, 9.08 mmol) in toluene (43.3 mL) and the resulting mixture was stirred at 90Â° C. for 90 minutes. The reaction was allowed to cool and partitioned between DCM (50 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (50 mL). The layers were separated and the organic layer was concentrated in vacuo. Purification was by silica gel column chromatography eluting with 0-50% ethyl acetate in heptane to give (6S,8R)-6-(5-bromo-3-fluoropyridin-2-yl)-1-fluoro-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (2.90 g, 69%) as a white solid.
