Technical Field The invention relates to novel HDAC inhibitors and a method of making such HDAC inhibitors. Further, the invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising the HDAC inhibitors of the invention. Background art Today, cancer is still one of the most threatening diseases in common societies. 13 % of the worldwide deaths (7.9 million people) in 2007 were caused by cancer. As the second most common cause of death (USA), exceeded only by heart diseases, cancer remains a burden to the health and even the funds off many societies [1][2][3]. The start of a cancer disease can be caused by environmental influences or the incorporation of toxins into a healthy cell, leading to several damages in its DNA. Cancer cells are characterized by their out-of-control growth, their invasion into different tissues and the extensive spreading over the whole body thru bloodstream and lymph system migration. Conventionally, cancer is treated by a mixture of chemotherapy, surgery and radiation, depending on the individual type of cancer. For a long time DNA crosslinking agents like Cisplatin were applied in treatments with chemotherapy to induce apoptosis. During the last decades of cancer research several new targets were explored, leading to new approaches for cancer treatments. Among these targets, the enzyme class of the so called histone deacetylases (HDACs) is one of the most promising ones. In the nucleus of cells, the DNA is structurally tensely packed by forming nucleosomes consisting of multiple units of a protein octamer and attached convoluted DNA. Those proteins, called histones, have a strong influence on the accessibility for transcriptional proteins by binding the DNA via acetylated histone-lysine residues. Acetylated lysine residues form tense structures with the negatively charged backbone of the DNA leading to reduced gene expression. HDACs play a prominent role in controlling the acetylation state of lysine residues located at the ends of histones. Occurring as a natural substrate, acetylated lysins become deacetylated by HDACs resulting in reduced gene expression due to a less accessible DNA structure. The loss of acetylations can be restored by the antagonistic histone-acetyl-transferases (HATs). In consequence of their fundamental influence on regulating gene expression, HDACs are associated with several diseases and vice versa are valid targets for cancer treatments [4]. In humans, the overall family of HDAC proteins contains 18 different members separated into four classes by their homology to yeast proteins, cellular localization and the structure of their active sites. Class I comprises of HDAC-1, -2, -3 and -8 which are homologue to the yeast protein RPD3 and retain mostly located in the nucleus. Class II HDAC members are divided into the further subclasses IIa and IIb. Class IIa Includes HDAC-4, -5, -7 and -9 which are homologue to yeast HDA1-deacetylase and contain one active site. In contrast, the HDAC IIb members HDAC-6 and -10 contain two active sites. However HDAC-10 carries only one completely functional active site while the second c-terminal localized domain lacks important residues of the active site. Class IIa members have the possibility of shuttling between cytoplasm and the nucleus. In contrast HDAC IIb members are localized in the cytoplasm. The Class IV member HDAC-11 shares a similar catalytic domain with Class I and II members. Yet, no substrate could be identified for this protein. All Class I, II and IV members are zinc dependent deacetylases. In contrast Class III proteins are NAD+ dependent and denoted as Sirtuins due to their yeast homologue SirT2 [5][6][7]. Despite their strong structural similarities, HDACs are involved in different non-redundant processes, which are tissue specific. Knock-out of HDAC-1, -2, -3 or -7 in mice are lethal in early embryonic states due to aberrant angiogenesis or cell cycle control. Mice with knock-out for HDAC-4, -5, -6, or -9 are viable with occurring abnormalities in cardiovascular, bone and muscle development. In cancer tissue a single knock-down of one HDAC results in specific symptoms. For example, HDAC-2 knock-down in colon cancer cells induces growth arrest, while lagging this effect in osteosarcoma or breast-cancer. Conducted studies found high expression levels of class I HDACs in many primary human cancer cell lines (breast, pancreas, lung, esophageal, gastric, colon, ovary and thyroid). Yet, less is known about expression levels of class II HDACs in cancer cell lines [6][8]. The high expression values of different HDAC members in cancer cell lines and their strong influence on gene regulation led to a new approach for cancer treatments based on Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi's). In the last few years several types of HDACi's could be identified for the zinc dependent HDAC classes (I, II and IV). Four main classes are established till today: hydroxamates, cyclic peptides, small fatty acids and benzamidines.EP 1 541 549 A1, for example, describes tricyclic hydroxamate and benzaminde derivatives as HDAC inhibitors. Off these four classes, the hydroxamates are the most enlightened group until today. In general, their structure consists of a variable cap group and a metal-binding hydroxamic acid group. Both parts are connected through an aliphatic or aromatic linker [15]. This structure basically mimics the natural substrate which complexes the zinc in the active site with an acetyl group instead of the hydroxamic acid. One of the first potent hydroxamate HDACi's was isolated from Streptomyces bydroscopicus: Trichostatin A (TSA, see below for structures). Based on this structure, a second very potent HDACi got synthesized: Vorinostat (SAHA, see below for structure). SAHA was one of the first HDACi that passed all clinical trials and was applied for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). However, most of the very potent HDACi's (TSA, SAHA) are rather unselective inhibitors. The inhibition of several or nearly all HDACs goes along with several side effects. To avoid these pharmacological issues research for HDAC isoform specific inhibitors became an urgent challenge. With the help of high troughput screenings (HTS) several new inhibitor structures were identified. Another way of finding isoform selective inhibitors included the chemical modification of already existing inhibitors, like the hydroxamates. Based on the structure of SAHA and TSA several different cap group modifications altered the selectivity for class I HDACs. In contrast, variations of the linker and metal-binding group had a much lesser influence on the isoform selectivity due to the strong structural homology of all isoforms in their active site structure (interacting with metal-binding group) and in their hydrophobic cavity (interacting with linker). Brief Summary of the invention There still is a need for alternative HDAC inhibitors. Such alternative HDAC inhibitors may, for example, be more specific and/or associated with fewer side effects. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide alternative HDAC inhibitors, in particular more selective, e.g HDAC class II selective HDAC inhibitors. A further object of the invention is to provide a method of making such alternative HDAC inhibitors. Still another object of the invention is the provision of pharmaceutically compositions comprising such alternative HDAC inhibitors. The present invention provides novel HDAC inhibitors having a perfluorinated linker between the metal(zinc)-binding group and the cap group. In the attempt to synthesize new HDACi's, the zinc binding groups and different capping structures have been varied, but the spacer was almost exclusively an alkyl chain of different lengths. Due to the exceptional high electronegativity of fluorine atoms perfluorinated spacers have not been taken in consideration for more than 20 years of HDACi synthesis. The only occurrence of fluorine atoms took place in a special class of HDACi inhibitors, the electrophilic ketones, particularly trifluoromethyl ketones, in which the electron attracting property of fluorine atoms is exploited. Therefore, it was not expected, that compounds with perfluorinated alkyl spacer turned out to be potent inhibitors of HDAH and HDACs. The provision of an HDACi with a perfluorinated linker structure is an innovative step paving the road for novel lead structures in HDACi research. The HDAC inhibitors according to the present invention are especially useful as an active ingredient in a medicament, in particular a medicament for treating cancer in humans.

The IC50 value is the half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC) of a substance (50% IC, or IC50), i.e. the concentration of a given compound that is necessary to inhibit a given biological process, e.g. an enzyme activity, by half. A two-step assay was used for this purpose. Two-step assay for determination of IC50 To obtain the IC50 value for an individual compound/HDAC pair, a two-step assay can be performed based on a fluorescence signal. In principle, an ε-acetylated lysine substrate is deacetylated by histone-deacetylases in the first step. Trypsin releases detectable 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (ex = excitation wavelength: 390 nm, em = emission wavelength: 460 nm) by cleaving the substrate at the deacetylated lysine in a subsequent reaction[9]. The enzyme activity is inhibited by a suitable HDACi. The obtained data are interpreted using a four parameter fit. Based on this fit, the IC50 value can be estimated. Analysis ot the data and calculation of the IC50 values was accomplished using a four-parameter logistic model protocol as previously described by Vølund[16]. For nonlinear fits the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was applied[17],[18]. An example data set with HDAC6 and the known inhibitor SAHA, already processed with the four parameter fit, is presented in Figure 1. Results for IC50 are presented in Table 1 below. Table 1: IC50 values in µM for synthesized compounds of the invention with a perfluorinated linker. The compounds RK216 and LU197 were used as negative control, SAHA as positive control.

Both compounds should show no activity due to their structural properties. The C6 alkyl chain in compound RK 216 is conformational bonded into a cyclohexane moiety. Compound LU197 has two benzylester groups at the endings, so the zinc-binding group is missing (see below for structures). In Table 1 it is evident that both compounds, i.e. RK 216 and LU197, show no activity. Further results with the synthesized compounds of the invention confirmed the predicted inhibitory effect when applied to different human HDAC classes (HDAC1, HDAC6, HDAC7 and HDAC8). The bacterial isoform HDAH is inhibited in a noticeable range too. Through these results the inhibitory potential of compounds with perfluorinated linker are revealed. Additionally, strong signs of structure based HDAC isoform selectivity can be observed. In summary, the results demonstrate the successful synthesis of novel HDAC inhibitors exhibiting unusual HDAC isoform selectivities. Some of the compounds are clearly selective for class II HDACs, particularly HDAC6. Therefore, compounds with perfluorinated linker and improved isoform selectivity should be valuable research tools and maybe potential lead structures for the development of drugs for the treatment of cancer and other diseases linked to unregulated HDACs, particularly class II HDACs[10][11][12]. Most of the side effects associated with the usage of approved cancer therapeutic SAHA, which inhibits both class I and class II HDACs (see table), are attributed to its effect against class I HDACs. Hence, class II selective HDAC inhibitors are supposed to cause less adverse effects. Citation List [1] Boyle, P., Levin, B. (2008) "World Cancer Report", IARC Nonserial Publication.
