Preparation of N-(azetidin-3-yl)-5-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-4-methoxypyridin-2-amine
Methanol (0.5 mL) was added to a flask charged with tert-butyl 3-((5-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-4-methoxypyridin-2-yl)amino)azetidine-1-carboxylate (0.047 g, 0.080 mmol). HCl in dioxane (4 M; 0.5 mL, 2 mmol) was added, and stirring continued for 2 hours. The reaction was then concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue was purified using an SCX-2 cartridge, eluting with 3N ammonia in methanol, to give crude N-(azetidin-3-yl)-5-((6S,8R)-7-((1-fluorocyclopropyl)methyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-4-methoxypyridin-2-amine (25 mg, 76%) as a gum. The product was used in the next step without further purification. m/z: ES+ [M+H]+ 437.
