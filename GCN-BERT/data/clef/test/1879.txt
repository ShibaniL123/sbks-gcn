This application claim benefit of priority from U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/796,128, filed Nov. 2, 2012, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The β-lactam ring (Hoten & Onusko (2000) Am. Family Physician 62:611-620) is part of the structure of several antibiotic families, principally the penicillin derivatives, cephalosporins and related compounds, which are therefore also called β-lactam antibiotics (Gilchrist (1997) Heterocyclic Chemistry Harlow: Longman). As a group, these drugs are active against many gram-positive, gram-negative and anaerobic organisms. These antibiotics work by inhibiting the bacterial cell wall synthesis (Levy (1992) The Antibiotics Paradox Plenum Press: New York). This has a lethal effect on bacteria. The discovery of antibiotics that can be used systemically is the most important medical event in the twentieth century. The story of the discovery by Sir Alexander Fleming of the penicillins in 1929 is well-known (Fleming (1929) Br. J. Exp. Pathol. 10:226-230). The introduction of penicillin into clinical trials in 1941 was followed in short order by the discovery of a plethora of penicillins and cephalosporins, streptomycin (Waksman, et al. (1946) J. Bacteriol. 52:393-7), chloramphenicol (Lagodsky, (1951) Biol. Med. (Paris) 40:2-81), tetracycline (Finland (1974) Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 15:3-8), and erythromycin (McGuire, et al. (1952) Antimicrob. Chemother. 2:281-283). However, shortly after the clinical introduction of antibiotics, reports of microbial resistance during the course of treatment began to appear in the literature. Penicillin was first used in 1941, and by 1942 publications relating to resistance appeared (Remmelkamp & Kamp (1942) Proc. Soc. Exptl. Biol. Med. 51:356-360). Resistance was noted with increasing frequency until this phenomenon could no longer be ignored (Mitscher (2008) J. Nat. Prod. 71:497-509). Societal impact of antibiotic resistance is a major public health problem (Metlay, et al. (2002) J. Gen. Inter. Med. 17:87-94). To avoid the development of antibiotic resistance, newer antibiotics should be reserved for patients infected with resistant bacteria. Effective strategies to deal with the resistance problem are relatively few. On approach includes the use of a combination therapy such as meropenem and clavulanate, which has been shown to kill replicating and non-replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Hugonnet, et al. (2009) Science 323:1215-8). Other strategies include searching for novel antibiotics, modification of existing antibiotics, synthesis and directed biosynthesis of novel antimicrobials, inhibition of bacterial enzymes that inactivate antibiotics, use of combinations of antibiotics, immunostimulants, and the identification of new targets for antibiotics. This effort subsequently led to combinatorial methods for synthesis of analogs of β-lactams (Frank, et al. (1998) Comb. Chem. High-Throughput Screen. 1:56-70; Kline, et al. (2000) Bioorgn. Med. Chem. 8:73-93), which have a number of targets, many of which are not related to peptidoglycan biosynthesis and many of which are found in eukaryotic cells (Veinberg, et al. (2013) Curr. Med. Chem. Vol. 20). The availability of 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA, 1; Batchelor, et al. (1959) Nature 183:257; Sheehan & Henery-Logan (1959) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 81:5838) has made possible the synthesis of new, improved penicillins when covalently linked to a side-chain moiety. The cephalosporin nucleus, 7-aminodesacetoxy cephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA, 2; Archer & Kitchell (1966) J. Org. Chem. 31:3409-11), was derived from cephalosporin C and is an analog of the penicillin nucleus 6-APA. Modification of the 7-ADCA side-chains could also result in the development of useful antibiotic agents. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention is a compound having the structure of Formula I, II, III, IV or V, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug thereof: wherein R3 is H, CH3 or —CR7; R4 and R5 are independently C1-C10 alkyl, —COO−, —COOH, —CR7, —C(═O)OR7, —C(═O)COR7, —C(═O)OCR7, —C(═O)C(—CH3)OR7, —CH2OR7, —C(═O)CH2CH2R7 or —NHR6; R6 is C1-C10 alkyl, C3-C7 cycloalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, or —CR7; R7 is C1-C10 alkyl, C2-C10 alkenyl, C2-C10 alkynyl, C3-C7 cycloalkyl, aryl, or heteroaryl; and X is N or O. Pharmaceutical compositions and methods of using the compounds and compositions to kill or inhibit the spread of microorganisms and prevent, mitigate or treat an infectious disease are also provided. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows that cephalosporin 13 has cidal activity against non-replicating wild-type Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Mtb was at an OD580 of 0.01 and exposed to compound 13 for 7 days at 1% O2 and enumerated on 7H11-OADC agar plates that support replication. Activity was clavulanate-independent. At 10 μg/mL, compound 13 killed Mtb below the limit of detection (100 colony forming units). FIG. 2 shows that compound 13 (100 μg/mL) kills wild-type Mtb infecting murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. Activation of the macrophages with 50 ng/mL IFNγ leads to improved killing with compound 13 by day 4 of drug treatment, likely due to production of nitric oxide and phagosomal acidification. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The long duration of chemotherapy to treat tuberculosis is thought to be due to non-replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria that are phenotypically resistant (non-heritable resistance) to chemotherapy by factors of host immunity. Failure to eradicate non-replicating M. tuberculosis by standard chemotherapy leaves the human host susceptible to recrudescence of latent bacilli and development of tuberculosis. Cephalosporins are broad spectrum antibiotics used in human medicine to kill replicating bacteria by blocking peptidoglycan biosynthesis. However, cephalosporins are not generally associated with having activity against M. tuberculosis. Furthermore, since peptidoglycan biosynthesis would likely not play an essential role when cells are not actively growing, the identification of 6-APA and 7-ADCA derivatives, as described herein, with activity against non-replicating M. tuberculosis was unexpected. Derivatization of 6-APA resulted in a range of compounds that contained amide and ester motifs within the low molecular weight structures. These were associated with the N-alkylation of β-lactam ring, the esterification of carboxylic acid moiety on the thiazolane ring, the amide formation on nucleophilic opening of the β-lactam ring using primary amines, and also the CO2-assisted rearrangement of the β-lactam ring. The resulting compounds have a more restricted antimicrobial spectra, more favorable absorption patterns and/or reduced undesirable effects and are stable under acid conditions and in the presence of reactive nitrogen intermediates or oxidation. Furthermore, these compounds were rapidly hydrolyzed in mouse serum, an effect which was not prevented by addition of ‘bulky’ groups such as aromatic groups near the ester. In addition, the compounds have limited toxicity against HepG2 cells thereby indicating their use in the treatment of tuberculosis. Therefore, this invention provides cephalosporin derivatives containing azetidine and oxetane rings, amide and ester motifs, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and prodrugs thereof, and their use in the treatment and/or prevention of disease caused by microorganisms. In one embodiment the cephalosporin derivatives of the invention are derivatives of 6-APA or 7-ADCA.

Wermuth eds., Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta, 2002). Compounds of the invention may also exist in prodrug form. Since prodrugs are known to enhance numerous desirable qualities of pharmaceuticals, e.g., solubility, bioavailability, manufacturing, etc., the compounds employed in some methods of the invention may, if desired, be delivered in prodrug form. Thus, the invention contemplates prodrugs of compounds of the present invention as well as methods of delivering prodrugs. Prodrugs of the compounds of this invention may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound. Accordingly, prodrugs include, for example, compounds described herein in which a hydroxy, amino, or carboxy group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug is administered to a patient, cleaves to form a hydroxy, amino, or carboxylic acid, respectively. For example, a compound having a hydroxy group may be administered as an ester that is converted by hydrolysis in vivo to the hydroxy compound.

Therapeutics, including compositions containing the cephalosporin derivatives of the invention, can be prepared in physiologically acceptable formulations, such as in pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, using known techniques. For example, a cephalosporin derivative is combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient to form a pharmaceutical composition. The compositions of the invention may be administered in the form of a solid, liquid or aerosol. Examples of solid compositions include pills, creams, soaps and implantable dosage units. Pills may be administered orally. Therapeutic creams and anti-bacterial soaps may be administered topically. Implantable dosage units may be administered locally, for example, in the lungs, or may be implanted for sustained release of the therapeutic composition, for example, subcutaneously. Examples of liquid compositions include formulations adapted for injection intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intravenously, intraarterially, and formulations for topical and intraocular administration. Examples of aerosol formulations include inhaler formulations for administration to the lungs. A sustained release matrix, as used herein, is a matrix made of materials, usually polymers, which are degradable by enzymatic or acid/base hydrolysis, or by dissolution. Once inserted into the body, the matrix is acted upon by enzymes and body fluids. The sustained release matrix is chosen desirably from biocompatible materials, including, but not limited to, liposomes, polylactides, polyglycolide (polymer of glycolic acid), polylactide co-glycolide (copolymers of lactic acid and glycolic acid), polyanhydrides, poly(ortho)esters, polypeptides, hyaluronic acid, collagen, chondroitin sulfate, carboxylic acids, fatty acids, phospholipds, polysaccharides, nucleic acids, polyamino acids, amino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, isoleucine, polynucleotides, polyvinyl propylene, polyvinylpyrrolidone and silicone. A preferred biodegradable matrix is a matrix of one of either polylactide, polyglycolide, or polylactide co-glycolide. The dosage of the composition will depend on the condition being treated, the particular compound used, and other clinical factors, such as weight and condition of the patient, and the route of administration. A suitable dosage may range from 100 to 0.1 mg/kg. A more preferred dosage may range from 50 to 0.2 mg/kg. A more preferred dosage may range from 25 to 0.5 mg/kg. Tablets or other forms of media may contain from 1 to 1000 mg of one or more cephalosporin derivatives. Dosage ranges and schedules of administration similar to ethambutol or other anti-tuberculosis drugs may be used. The compounds of this invention can be used alone or in combination with conventional antimicrobial agents used in the treatment of infectious disease. In particular, the invention includes a combination therapy composed of one or more cephalosporin derivatives as presently described together with one or more antitubercular agents, including but not limited to, isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethionamide, ethambutol, streptomycin, fluoroquinolones (e.g., moxifloxacin), linezolid, β-lactams (e.g., meropenem), β-lactams in conjunction with β-lactamase inhibitors (e.g., clavulanate), and experimental drugs such as PA-824 and R207910 (i.e., Bedaquiline sold under the tradename SIRTURO). Furthermore, one or more cephalosporin derivatives may be administered in combination with other compositions and procedures for the treatment of other disorders occurring in combination with mycobacterial disease. For example, tuberculosis frequently occurs as a secondary complication associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Therefore, patients undergoing AIDS treatment may benefit from the therapeutic methods and compositions described herein.

In this respect, the methods and compositions of this invention are intended for the treatment of mycobacterial infections in human, as well as other animals. For example, this invention may be particularly useful for the treatment of cows infected by M. bovis. Moreover, the compositions and methods of the invention are particular useful in the treatment of infections in which some of the mycobacteria are non-replicating. This invention further provides methods and compositions useful for the prevention, mitigation and/or treatment of infectious disease caused by one or more of the microorganisms described above. In this respect, the invention includes methods for the prevention, mitigation and/or treatment of infectious diseases including by not limited to, tuberculosis, leprosy, Crohn's Disease, lyme disease, cat-scratch disease and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. As used herein, the term “tuberculosis” is intended to include disease states usually associated with infections caused by mycobacteria species of the M. tuberculosis complex.

As used herein, the term “treatment” or “treating” means any therapeutic intervention in a mammal, preferably a human or any other animal suffering from a bacterial infection, such that symptoms and bacterial numbers are reduced or eliminated. “Prevention” or “preventing” refers to prophylactic treatment causing the clinical symptoms not to develop, e.g., preventing infection from occurring and/or developing to a harmful state. “Mitigation” or “mitigating” means arresting the development of clinical symptoms, e.g., stopping an ongoing infection to the degree that it is no longer harmful, or providing relief or regression of clinical symptoms, e.g., a decrease in fluid loss resulting from an infection. In accordance with this invention, a subject in need of prevention, mitigation or treatment is administered an effective amount of a composition containing one or more cephalosporin derivatives disclosed herein, thereby preventing, mitigating, or treating a bacterial infection. Subjects benefiting from the method of the invention include those having (e.g., exhibiting signs or symptoms) or at risk of having (e.g., a subject exposed to a contaminated food or water source) a bacterial infection as described herein. The terms “effective amount” means a dosage sufficient to provide prevention, mitigation and/or treatment of a bacterial infection. The amount and dosage regimen of the composition of the invention to be administered is determined in the light of various relevant factors including the purpose of administration (e.g., prevention, mitigation or treatment), the age, sex and body weight of an individual subject, and/or the severity of the subject's symptoms. In this respect, the compositions of the invention can be administered under the supervision of a medical specialist, or may be self-administered. In addition to treatment, it is contemplated that the compounds of this invention can labeled and used as to identify target molecules that bind or interact with the compounds of the invention.

Example 2 High-Throughput Screening Assay A high-throughput screen was designed to identify compounds that killed M. tuberculosis. This screen used a novel model of non-replication that combined four physiological stresses, including hypoxia (1% O2), mild acid (pH 5.0), a flux of nitric oxide and reactive nitrogen intermediates (0.5 mM NaNO2). See Gold, et al. (2012) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 109:16004-16011. In addition, the assay included replacing a sugar carbon source (glycerol and dextrose) with a fatty acid (50 μM butyrate). Three lead compounds were identified in the first round of high throughput screening (700 compounds), which had minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 0.4-0.8 μg/mL after a six day exposure to drug (NRd6) in the model of non-replication at pH 5.0, and LD50's of 100 to >100 μg/mL against HepG2 cells (a 2 day exposure). These three compounds were compounds 11c, 12b and 13. These compounds either had very weak activity under replication conditions (i.e., an MIC of 100 μg/mL), or no activity in replication conditions (i.e., >100 μg/mL). The selectivity indices (LD50/MIC-NRd6) ranged from 129 (11c) to >256 (12b and 13). Compound 11c was unstable in the non-replication medium containing 0.5 mM NaNO2, yet still had potent non-replication activity, indicating very fast binding to its target before degradation. A larger library was also screened (3000+ compounds library) and compounds 11c, 12b and 13 were again identified as exhibiting inhibiting activity. The three compounds were subsequently subjected to cherry pick confirmation. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 1.

NR activity in bold indicates compounds with notable activity. In, addition, compounds 11c, 12b and 13, were subjected to concentration-response curve analysis (dose-response from 0.4-100 μg/mL with 2-fold increments) in both replication and non-replication (NR, pH 5.0 and 5.5 with a 3- or 6-day exposure to drug) conditions. Furthermore, LD50 values were determined using a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) using intracellular ATP levels as a measurement that correlated with cellular viability. The results of these analyses are presented in Table 2 and show that activity was enhanced with an extended time of bacterial exposure to compound.

All three compounds were subsequently resynthesized to >95% purity and analyzed. The results of this analysis are presented in Table 3, which also summarizes LC-MS determination of compound stability in the non-replication media over 6 days.

Stability analysis was carried out in non-replication media without bovine serum albumin and tyloxapol. The three cephalosporins were then tested against a variety of Gram positive and negative bacteria to determine the antibiotic spectrum (Table 4; n=1 experiment).

Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the cephalosporin activity in the non-replication model was dependent on nitrite. Example 3 Probe Compound Library Based Upon β-Lactam Chemistry The acylation of 6-APA at its NH moiety was carried out herein. Penicillin 4a (penicillin V) described in Scheme 1 were prepared by treating phenoxyacetyl chloride with 6-aminopenicillanic acid (6-APA) in aqueous acetone solution containing an excess of sodium bicarbonate. The penicillin as the free acid (pH=2) was extracted into a water-immiscible organic solvent and then precipitated as the potassium salt by the addition of potassium 2-ethylhexanoate. The compound obtained by this method was found to be easier to purify and in good yield (80%). The potassium salt was washed with dry acetone immediately after filtration, no further recrystallization was necessary since the material obtained was found to be analytically pure. The racemic phenoxypropanyl chloride was used in the preparation of compound 4b, so the new penicillin 4b was obtained as a mixture of diastereoisomers. Parallel synthesis of carboxylic acid esters of 6-APA was employed to react various aliphatic, aromatic and heterocyclic bromide or iodide with the potassium salt of penicillins (4a and 4b) to generate penicillin carboxylic esters 5a-5k (Scheme 2) in good to modest yields. The penicillin esters were isolated by flash chromatography over silica gel using 9:1 EtOAc/hexane as an eluent. The final products were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, LC-MS and HRMS.

The target thiazolidine amides were isolated by flash chromatography over silica gel using 1:1 EtOAc/hexane as an eluent. The yields reported are isolated yields and the purity of the final products was confirmed using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, LC-MS and HRMS. SCHEME 3 Entry R2 Yields (%) 6a 55 6b 62 6c 63 6d 54 6e 64 6f 58 The rearrangement of the β-lactam ring was also investigated. Thus, synthesis of disodium salt of 8-hydroxypenillic acid from 6-APA, as shown in Scheme 4, was carried out by modification of a known method (Johnson & Hardcastle (1961) supra). 6-APA (4.5 g) was dissolved in 100 mL of water containing 3.5 g (2 equiv.) of sodium bicarbonate. Carbon dioxide from dry ice source was bubbled through the stirred mixture at room temperature for 24 hours. The concentrated aqueous solution was then lyophilized overnight to produce the disodium salt of the required product as a pale yellow powder in high yield (90%), m.p. 228-230° C. (dec.). Although 8-hydroxypenillic acid is the traditional common name for this compound it likely exists predominantly in the keto form as depicted in 7. The mechanism proposed for the reaction is also shown in Scheme 5. Thus, it appears that the compound is formed by carboxylation of the amino group of 6-aminopenicillanic acid followed by a penillic acid rearrangement. Spectral analysis of the 1H and 13C NMR features of 8-hydroxypenillic acid (isolated as the disodium salt by lyophilization) was consistent with the fused imidazolinethiazolidine structure 7. Chemical shifts of the 3- and 6-carbonyl carbons (˜170 ppm) gave evidence of the ionized state of both carboxylate functions. The 1H NMR spectrum of the disodium salt of 8-hydroxypenillic acid was well resolved and displayed no unassigned signals of significant intensity, evidence that the conversion of 1 to 7 proceeds in a highly stereo-specific manner. Alkylation of 8-hydroxypenillic acid was initiated by using aliphatic and aromatic bromides, which were reacted with the disodium salt 7 in DMF to afford the corresponding di-ester analogues 8a-8c as white solids (Scheme 6). Since N,N-diethylaminoethyl bromide hydrobromide was employed for the synthesis of 8d, excess sodium bicarbonate was added first into the solution as an exceptional to quench the hydrobromide acid. The compound 8d was isolated by extracting with diethyl ether from the water solution of the reaction mixture. SCHEME 6 Entry R Yields (%) 8a CH3 60 8b 62 8c 63 8d 40 The second diversification of 8-hydroxypenillic acid was carried out at its N6 position by alkylation with benzyl bromide and 2-(bromomethyl)benzo[d]thiazole using potassium carbonate as base in DMF (Scheme 7). SCHEME 7 Entry R1 R2 Yields (%) 9a CH3 49 9b CH3 40 An analogue of 8-hydroxypenillic acid from 7-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid (7-ADCA, 2) was also pursued. Therefore, the same reaction was carried out for 7-ADCA with respect to the rearrangement of 6-APA (Scheme 8). However, there was only clear evidence that 7-ADCA reacted with carbon dioxide to form some amount of carbamate (10a) in the presence of sodium bicarbonate, and the reaction was not complete at room temperature. The rearrangement of 7-ADCA with intramolecular carbamate participation was less facile than 6-APA. SCHEME 8 Entry R Yields (%) 11a CH3 15 11b 10 11c 15 The carbamate formation with 7-ADCA was completed by using microwave synthesizer at 70° C. for two hours. Direct chemical verification of complete carbamate formation involved the preparation of carbamate esters (12a-12d) by treatment of the solid obtained from a lyophilized bicarbonate solution of 7-ADCA after microwave condition with various aliphatic, aromatic and heterocyclic bromides (Scheme 9).

Compounds 17-107 exhibit inhibitory activity in one or both of the replication or non-replication mycobacterial model (Table 8). Moreover, compounds focusing on log P are expected to exhibit enhanced uptake through the thick, waxy Mycobacterial cell wall.

Example 5 Activity of 3,4-Olefinic Isomers 3,4-Olefinic isomers were also prepared (compounds 118 and 119). Compounds 118 and 119 both had a minimum inhibitory concentration of 3.1 μg/mL against non-replicating M. tuberculosis compared to 100 μg/mL against replicating M. tuberculosis. Therefore, this invention also includes 3,4-olefinic isomers. Example 6 Non-Replicating Active Cephalosporins Display Inoculum-Dependent Killing The potency of many cell-wall active antibiotics, including β-lactams, is known to display inoculum dependency. To determine whether this held true for the non-replicating (NR) active cephalosporins, the NR minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of NR-active cephalosporins was determined at inocula of A580 of 0.1 and 0.01 using the BSL2+ΔpanCDΔlysA Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strain. Although some MICs were not impacted, many of the NR-active cephalosporins gained activity against Mtb at a lower inoculum; in some cases up to a 16-fold decrease in MIC. Moreover, significant cidality of compound 13 was observed against wild-type Mtb at a starting inoculum of 0.01 (FIG. 1). This is consistent with previous findings, which showed that the NR-active cephalosporins kill wild-type Mtb in a CFU-based assay and demonstrates that they gain activity at a lower inoculum. Moreover, this result is consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of cephalosporins, which target peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Example 7 NR-Active Cephalosporins do not Synergize with a β-Lactamase Inhibitor Meropenem synergizes with clavulanic acid, a β-lactamase inhibitor, to potently kill Mtb (Hugonnet, et al. (2009) Science 323:1215-8). To determine whether the NR-active cephalosporins shared this property, wild-type Mtb was exposed to compound 13 in the presence of absence of clavulanate under NR conditions for 7 days. Bacterial viability was monitored by enumeration of 7H11 agar plates containing OADC supplement. An increase in potency of compound 13 to kill Mtb was not detected in the presence of clavulanate. It was posited that compound 13 failed to kill replicating (R) Mtb due to inactivation by β-lactamases. To test this, the MIC of compound 13 was tested against replicating Mtb in the presence or absence of clavulanic acid. The MICs were identical in the presence or absence of clavulanic acid against replicating Mtb. Thus, these data indicate that compound 13 is not a substrate for clavulanate-inhibitable β-lactamases. Example 8 Compound 13 Kills Intracellular Mtb The four-stress NR model of NaNO2, mild acid, hypoxia, and a fatty acid carbon source was designed to replicate conditions encountered by Mtb in an activated macrophage phagosome. The combination of Mtb and interferon gamma (IFNγ) potently activates the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and acidifies the phagosomal compartment to ˜pH 4.5. Thus, it was expected that compounds of the invention with NR activity would also be active against Mtb infecting murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) activated with IFNγ. Accordingly, BMDMs were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5, and after 4-6 hours of Mtb uptake into the macrophages, were washed to remove away any remaining extracellular bacteria. Treatment with 100 μg/mL compound 13 subsequently commenced. After two days, the macrophage medium was partly exchanged for fresh medium (50%) and fresh compound 13. In two independent experiments, killing of intracellular Mtb (˜1.5 log10 reduction of CFU in activated macrophages) was observed. By visual inspection at 400× magnification, there was no toxicity of compound 13 to the macrophages. The killing potential of compound 13 was further tested against Mtb in both unactivated macrophages (−IFNγ) and activated macrophages (+50 ng/mL IFNγ) (FIG. 2). Increased killing by compound 13 in IFNγ-activated BMDMs (approximately 0.5 log10) was observed, which is consistent with the preference of compound 13 for mild acid and nitric oxide to kill. Example 9 NR-Active Cephalosporins Lack Broad Spectrum Activity Many β-lactams possess broad-spectrum activity against bacteria with a peptidoglycan cell wall. To explore this, compound 13 was tested for activity against a panel of Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and Gram-positive (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus) bacterial pathogens in replicating conditions (Table 4). In addition, activity was tested against the fungus Candida albicans at pH 5.0. Compound 13 had MIC's of >100 μg/mL against all five strains; compound 11c and compound 12b had MIC's of >100 μg/mL against the four bacteria and was not tested against C. albicans. These data are consistent with the NR-active cephalosporins having a narrow spectrum of activity against non-replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 1.
