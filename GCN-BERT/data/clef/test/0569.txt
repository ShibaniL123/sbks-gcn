FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention in general relates to therapeutic management methods for hypercholesterolemia. More specifically, the present invention relates to the management of hypercholesterolemia in mammalian subjects using therapeutically effective amounts of Calebin A. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Description of Prior Art Hypercholesterolemia is a condition characterized by very high levels of cholesterol in the blood. The common medical causes of hypercholesterolemia include, 1. Carcinoma, hepatocellular;2. Hypertriglyceridemia;3. Familial hypercholesterolemia;4. Coronary artery disease;5. Diabetes mellitus;6. Nephritic syndrome;7. Zieve's syndrome;8. Anorexia nervosa;9. Lack of physical activity;10. Obesity; and11. Diet rich in saturated fat While the human body requires cholesterol for multifarious functions like building cell membranes, making hormones, and producing fat digestive compound, excessive cholesterol increases a person's risk of developing heart disease. People with hypercholesterolemia have a high risk of developing a form of heart disease called “atherosclerotic heart disease” or “coronary artery disease” where excess cholesterol in the bloodstream is deposited in the walls of blood vessels, particularly in the arteries that supply blood to the heart (coronary arteries). The abnormal buildup of cholesterol forms clumps (plaque) that narrow and harden artery walls. As the clumps get bigger, they can clog the arteries and restrict the flow of blood to the heart. The buildup of plaque in coronary arteries causes a form of chest pain called angina and greatly increases a person's risk of having a heart attack. In general optimized cholesterol metabolism is required for healthy living. Cholesterol travels through the bloodstream in small packages called lipoproteins. Two kinds of lipoproteins carry cholesterol throughout the body: low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and high-density lipoproteins (HDL). Having healthy levels of both types of lipoproteins is important. LDL cholesterol sometimes is called “bad” cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in arteries. HDL cholesterol sometimes is called “good” cholesterol. This is because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. The liver then removes the cholesterol from your body. Effective therapeutic management methods for hypercholesterolemia aim to reduce LDL cholesterol and increase levels of HDL cholesterol so that excess cholesterol may be removed efficiently from the body. Accordingly, it is the principle objective of the present invention to disclose method of therapeutically managing hypercholesterolemia in mammals using therapeutically effective amounts of Calebin A. The present invention fulfills the principle objective and provides related advantages. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Disclosed is a therapeutic management method of hypercholesterolemia in mammals. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method of reducing high levels of circulating cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia) in the blood stream of mammals, said method involving step of administering therapeutically effective amounts of Calebin A to said mammals.

While the invention has been described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it is to be clearly understood by those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited thereto. Rather, the scope of the invention is to be interpreted only in conjunction with the appended claims. Calebin-A naturally occurs in some Curcuma species along with two isomeric forms of Demethoxy-Calebin A and a single isomer of Bis-Demethoxy Calebin A. These three analogs of Calebin A occur in minute quantities. But they share many of the properties of Calebin A to a large extent depending on the test system. Hence the claims on the uses of Calebin A very well extend to these natural s and synthetic analogs also. 1.
