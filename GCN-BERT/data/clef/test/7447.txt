CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of Application No. CN2014/077427 filed May 14, 2014. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to oral care compositions having improved stability via the removal of stannous ions and inclusion of low molecular weight polyethylene glycols (PEGs). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Traditionally, tin (II) (stannous) ions are added to oral care compositions to deliver multiple benefits such as anti-microbial effects, control of breath malodor, control of dental plaque growth and metabolism, and reduced gingivitis. However, oral care compositions containing stannous ions (e.g., SnCl2), especially in combination with thickening agents such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), can suffer from poor stability. One of the main reasons for the problem is that Sn2+ ion interacts with anionic polymer CMC. Further, Sn2+ is prone to oxidation causing the oral care composition to exhibit an unacceptably low viscosity. If a formulation routinely decreases in viscosity, such oral care composition can lack phase stability and tends to undergo phase separation over time. Additionally, oral care compositions, such as a dentifrice, need to balance a number of important health factors such as cleaning, whitening, gum health, and the like with consumer important properties such as pleasant taste and mouth feel. Taste is primarily driven by the type and level of flavor oils included in the formulations. Mouth feel is a result of the rheology and viscosity of the oral care composition. With taste, for example, consumers like flavors such as peppermint, spearmint, wintergreen, and cinnamon in their oral care compositions. Flavorants are added to the formulation to provide these flavors. These flavorants belong to the class of materials called “volatile oils”, which are generally water-insoluble in aqueous systems at the concentrations needed to provide the desired flavor effects or impact. As a result, solubilizing agents are required. Such solubilizing agents may include: (i) solvents such as ethanol or propylene glycol, and (ii) surfactants such as sodium lauryl sulfate. However, there are challenges with using solvents and surfactants. For example, solvents, particularly at high levels, can impart an unpleasant taste (e.g., bitter, chemical taste) or sensation (e.g., burning). Surfactants used at high levels can impart a bitter or soapy taste and also cause tissue irritation and/or oral cavity desquamation. With mouth feel, consumers like oral care compositions that are not too runny or too thick and will sit on top of the toothbrush bristles. Polymeric thickeners are commonly used to provide the desirable rheology profile for the oral care compositions. Formulary challenges exist that make it difficult to achieve the desirable mouth feel. For example, too little thickener and the oral care composition can feel watery. Alternatively, too much thickener makes the oral care composition feel gritty in the mouth and difficult to dispense. A particular challenge for formulating oral care composition that contain essentially water-insoluble components, such as flavor oils, is achieving acceptable phase stability and/or sufficient shelf-life for the product without sacrificing taste and mouth feel. Phase instability tends to be an issue for oral care compositions formulated with flavor oils in combination with other oral care actives via use of emulsions, specifically oil-in-water emulsions. There are two key factors that can impact phase stability of the oral care compositions containing emulsions. One factor is the viscosity of the external phase (i.e., aqueous phase) surrounding the emulsions. In the case of an oil-in-water emulsion, the decreasing viscosity of the external aqueous phase over time can negatively affect the kinetic stability of the emulsion. For example, the flavor oil molecules can diffuse out of the oil droplet phase into the water phase and then fuse into larger oil droplets. The destabilization caused by the combination of oil droplet collisions and coalescence can lead to the formation of one big oil droplet and the emulsion becoming two separate phases. The time-line for the above reaction can be significantly accelerated in oral care composition having decreased viscosity of the aqueous phase. Current solutions focus on increasing levels of thickeners and/or humectants such as PEGs (see U.S. Patent Publication No. 2013/280182; P&G) to the formulation to modify (i.e., increase) the viscosity of the external aqueous phase and slow down movements of the oil droplets. One disadvantage of using higher levels of thickeners and/or humectants is that it can be expensive. Another disadvantage is that the resulting product can possess an undesirable taste and/or mouth feel. A second factor that can impact phase stability of the oral care composition is the droplet sizes of the emulsions that form. Droplet sizes impact the emulsions' ability to remain kinetically stable over long periods of time. Prior art approaches to control droplet sizes generally focus on controlling processing conditions. Thus, the need remains for oral care compositions containing flavorants having improved phase stability and/or shelf-life stability over time (i.e., greater than 4 months to 24 months or longer), preferably at ambient conditions. The need also exist for an oral care composition containing flavorants to have physical and chemical stability across a range of manufacturing, handling and storage conditions. It is desirable that the oral care composition, is a dentifrice, and preferably provide pleasant taste and mouth feel experience. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Applicants have surprisingly discovered that it is possible to overcome the phase stability problem for an oral care composition containing flavorants, preferably a dentifrice, by regulating the oil droplet sizes of the emulsions that form within the oral care composition to a certain average mean particle size range (i.e., less than 100 nm) by removal of stannous ions (e.g., SnCl2) and inclusion of low molecular weight PEGs, preferably at low levels, can be used to achieve these benefits. In one aspect, the present invention is directed to an oral care composition comprising: a) from 0.01% to 5%, preferably from 0.1% to 2%, of a zinc ion source; b) from 0.01% to 5%, preferably 0.1% to 2%, of a flavor composition; c) from 30% to 75% of a total water content; d) from 0.1% to 3% of a first humectant comprising polyethylene glycols (PEG) having an average molecular weight range of from 300 Da to 8,000 Da; and e) from 0.01% to 5%, preferably from 0.1% to 3%, or 1% to 2.5%, of a thickener system comprising a combination of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), and carrageenan. In an embodiment, the oral care composition is substantially free of stannous ions. This minimizes cost and complexity to the formulation. In another aspect, the present invention relates to a method for treating the oral cavity comprising administering to the oral cavity an oral care composition as described herein above. One aim of the present invention is to provide an oral care composition as described herein above which can exhibit improved stability. Another aim of the present invention is to provide such an oral care composition as described herein above with robust oil droplet sizes of the emulsions that form within the oral care composition to allow the composition to exhibit sufficient phase stability such that it does not phase separate after 4 months, preferably after 6 months, more preferably after 12 months, or even more preferably after 24 months, at ambient conditions. A further aim of the present invention is to provide such an oral care composition as described herein above with high levels (i.e., up to 5%) of flavor oils in combination with other oral care actives via use of emulsion without a significant variation in the phase stability of the composition after 4 to 24 months, at ambient conditions. A yet further aim of the present invention is to provide such an oral care composition as described herein above with relatively more water-insoluble flavor oils such as, for non-limiting example, peppermint and spearmint, without a significant variation in the phase stability of the composition after 4 to 24 months, at ambient conditions. These and other features of the present invention will become apparent to one skilled in the art upon review of the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the appended claims. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS While the specification concludes with claims that particularly point out and distinctly claim the invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the following description of the accompanying figures. FIG. 1 is a photo of a prior art oral care composition that has undergone phase separation due to the interaction between SnCl2 and CMC.

The above terms encompass the terms “consisting of” and “consisting essentially of”′. As used herein, the words “preferred”, “preferably” and variants refer to embodiments of the invention that afford certain benefits, under certain circumstances. However, other embodiments may also be preferred, under the same or other circumstances. Furthermore, the recitation of one or more preferred embodiments does not imply that other embodiments are not useful, and is not intended to exclude other embodiments from the scope of the invention. Oral Care Compositions In one aspect, it is desirable to produce an oral care composition for practical commercial use that has at least greater than 4 months, greater than 6 months, greater than 1 year, greater than 1.5 years, or up to 2 years, or combinations therein between, of shelf-life stability and/or phase stability. Specifically, the present invention provides an oral care composition comprising: a) from 0.01% to 5%, preferably from 0.1% to 2%, of a zinc ion source by weight of the composition;b) from 0.01% to 5%, preferably 0.1% to 2%, by weight of the composition of a flavor composition;c) from 30% to 75% by weight of the composition of a total water content;d) from 0.1% to 3% by weight of the composition of a first humectants comprising polyethylene glycols (PEGs) having an average molecular weight range of from 300 Da to 8,000 Da; ande) from 0.01% to 5%, preferably from 0.1% to 3%, or 1% to 2.5%, by weight of the composition of a thickener system comprising a combination of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), and carrageenan;wherein the oral care composition is substantially free of stannous ions. In an embodiment, the oral care composition is an oil-in-water emulsion having a dispersed phase comprising oil droplets having an average mean particle size of from 1 nm to 100 nm. In another embodiment, the oral care composition is an oil-in-water emulsion having a dispersed phase comprising oil droplets having an average mean particle size of less than 100 nm, less than 90 nm, less than 80 nm, less than 70 nm, less than 60 nm, less than 50 nm, less than 40 nm, less than 30 nm, or less than 10 nm after 14 days at 40° C. Free of Stannous Ions The present invention is based on the observation that oral care compositions containing stannous ions (e.g., SnCl2) in combination with certain thickening agents, such as charged cellulose derivatives like sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), suffer from decrease in viscosity of the composition. Over time this leads to the liquid separating from the body of the composition and a phase stability problem (see FIG. 1). Without wishing to be bound by theory, this problem is attributed to the interaction between SnCl2 and CMC, as CMC is an anionic polysaccharide commonly used as a structurant material in oral care compositions. The reaction between oxygen with the unbound Sn ions in the formulation, as follows, makes this interaction even worse: [in-line-formulae]6SnCl2 (aq)+O2 (g)+2H2O(l)→2SnCl4 (aq)+4Sn(OH)Cl(s) [/in-line-formulae] Further, it is believed that the higher valent ion (e.g., Sn4+) precipitate formed when the stannous oxidization occurs to inhibit the CMC gel hydration. As a consequence, the viscosity of the composition drops and the composition becomes thinner and more watery. Insufficient structuring of the external phase surrounding the emulsions in the oral care composition can speed up the migration of the oil droplets. As a result, larger oil droplets will tend to form faster and the risk for phase separation is accelerated. Accordingly, Applicants have surprisingly discovered that in order to avoid, or at least mitigate, and to reduce and/or eliminate the phase separation problem oral care compositions should be formulated to be substantially free of stannous ions. Flavorants The terms “flavor oils”, “flavorants”, and “flavor compositions” are used interchangeably and in the broadest sense to include flavor ingredients, or sensates, or sensate agents, or combinations thereof. It is critical for consumer delight to be able to formulate oral care compositions with a wider range of flavorants to include those that are more hydrophobic and less water soluble such as peppermint and spearmint. Further, it is desirable to have the ability to formulate oral care composition with higher than currently practicable levels of flavor oils for flavor impact or extra benefits without having to using higher levels of solvents (e.g., thickeners, humectants). It is also desirable to produce oral care composition having at least 4 months to 24 months shelf-life or phase stability. By stability herein is meant that the emulsion formed from the flavorants and solvents is stable against phase separation under storage conditions up to 40-50° C. It's particularly challenging to maintain small droplet size formed from the flavorants absent the addition of extra structuring/thickening agents and/or costly or lengthy processing measures. Although flavorants are “volatile oils” and considered water-insoluble, they tend to have some level of water solubility. This slight water solubility makes formulating and stabilization of emulsions containing flavorants difficult. Without wishing to be bound by theory, this is primarily due to the effect called Ostwald Ripening. Ostwald Ripening is the phenomena often found in oil-in-water emulsions in which smaller oil particles in solution spontaneously dissolve and deposit on larger oil particles to reach a more thermodynamically stable state wherein the surface area to volume ratio is minimized. The combination of destabilization by oil droplet collisions and coalescence, in addition to Ostwald Ripening in the case of volatile oils, can lead to the oil phase eventually becoming one big droplet to lower surface energy and minimize total surface area. When this occurs, over time the emulsion becomes unstable and eventually two separate phases. For standard oral care compositions, this may take anywhere from a few weeks to a few months. In an embodiment, Applicants have solved this formulation challenge by controlling the range of average mean particle size of the oil droplets to be less than 100 nm, less than 90 nm, less than 80 nm, less than 70 nm, less than 60 nm, less than 50 nm, less than 40 nm, less than 30 nm, less than 20 nm, or less than 10 nm. In another embodiment, the oral care composition is an oil-in-water emulsion having a dispersed phase comprising oil droplets having an average mean particle size from 1 nm to 100 nm, from 1 nm to 50 nm, or from 1 nm to 30 nm. In yet another embodiment, the oil droplets have the above prescribed average mean particle size ranges for at least the first week, at least the first two weeks, at least the first three weeks, or at least the first four weeks after production. Particle size measurements are performed using the Zetasizer Nano which uses a process called Dynemic Light Scattering (DSL). Dynamic Light Scattering (also known as “PCS-Photon Correlation Spectroscopy”) measures Brownian motion and relates this to the size of the particle. This is done by illuminating the particle with a laser and analyzing the intensity fluctuations in the scattered light. Details of the method are disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2013/0344120. The Zeta-sizer Nano System measures the rate of the intensity of the fluctuations and then uses this to calculate the size of the particles using mathematical algorithms. Peak statistics are calculated using the expressions given below where Yi is the Y value of the ith Y axis class/bin and Xi is the X axis value in the center of the X axis class/bin. The Y axis here is the Intensity (%) while the X axis is the diameter (nm). Area is defined as the area under each peak, relative to the total area of the distribution. Average mean particle size is defined as the average value of the peak, weighted by the Y axis parameter. [in-line-formulae]% Area=ΣiYi [/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]Mean=pS(i)I(i)/Area[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]Polydispersity or Width of the Peak=Square root((ΣXi2Yi/% area)−Mean2)[/in-line-formulae] Polydispersity Index (“PDI”) is a number calculated from a simple 2 parameter fit to the correlation data (the cummulants analysis). The PDI is dimensionless and scaled such that values smaller than 0.05 are seen with highly monodisperse standards. Values greater than 0.7 indicate that the sample has a very broad size distribution and is probably not suitable for the dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique. The various size distribution algorithms work with data that fall between these two extremes. The calculations for these parameters are defined in the ISO standard document 13321:1996 E and ISO 22412:2008. The oral care compositions herein may include from about 0.01% to 5%, alternatively from 0.01% to 4%, alternatively from 0.1% to 3%, alternatively from 0.5% to 2%, alternatively combination thereof, of a flavor composition by weight of the oral care composition. Flavor ingredients may include those described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2012/0082630A1. Non-limiting examples of flavor compositions or flavor ingredients include: mint oils, wintergreen, clove bud oil, cassia, sage, parsley oil, marjoram, lemon, orange, propenyl guaethol, heliotropine, 4-cis-heptenal, diacetyl, methyl-p-tert-butyl phenyl acetate, methyl salicylate, ethyl salicylate, 1-menthyl acetate, oxanone, a-irisone, methyl cinnamate, ethyl cinnamate, butyl cinnamate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl acetate, methyl anthranilate, iso-amyl acetate, iso-amyl butyrate, allyl caproate, eugenol, eucalyptol, thymol, cinnamic alcohol, octanol, octanal, decanol, decanal, phenylethyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, a-terpineol, linalool, limonene, citral, neral, geranial, geraniol nerol, maltol, ethyl maltol, anethole, dihydroanethole, carvone, menthone, beta-damascenone, ionone, gamma-decalactone, gamma-nonalactone, y-undecalactone, or combinations thereof. Generally suitable flavor ingredients are chemicals with structural features and functional groups that are less prone to redox reactions. These include derivatives of flavor ingredients that are saturated or contain stable aromatic rings or ester groups. Sensates such as cooling, warming, and tingling agents are useful to deliver signals to the consumer. The most well-known cooling agent is menthol, particularly 1-menthol, which is found naturally in peppermint oil. Among synthetic cooling agents, many are derivatives of or are structurally related to menthol, i.e., containing the cyclohexane moiety, and derivatized with functional groups including carboxamide, ketal, ester, ether and alcohol. Examples include N-(4-cyanomethylphenyl)-ρ-menthanecarboxamide (Evercool 180) and p-menthanecarboxamide compounds such as N-ethyl-p-menthan-3-carboxamide.

Flavorant Polarity The polarity of flavorant compositions can be characterized by dielectric constant or water index. Individual flavor ingredients, of the flavor composition, can be characterized by its octanol-water partition coefficient. Measuring the dielectric constant of a flavorant composition is a convenient way to determine the relative polarity of a mixture of flavor ingredients. The Dielectric constant (DEC) is measured by placing a charge across two conductive plates with a test liquid between them. These test materials or dielectrics act as insulators which change the capacitance or charge storage capacity of the circuit. DEC can easily be measured for most liquids by using the Model 870 Dielectric Constant meter produced by Brookhaven. For most liquids used in oral care products the DEC varies from 2 for extremely hydrophobic liquids to 80 for water. Many flavor compositions have DECs from 6 to 11, and individual flavor ingredients can vary from 2 to 22. In general flavor compositions with the high DEC values solubilize much easier than ones with low values. In general, flavorant compositions are also much easier to emulsify than their individual flavor ingredients (so called “increased mutual solvency”). The DEC of a material is strongly correlated (R2=0.92) to its solubility parameter (SP). SP is a universal parameter used to predict solubility and hydrophobicity of materials. See also “Computation of dielectric constants of solvent mixtures and electrolyte solutions,” Wang and Anderko, Fluid Phase Equilibria 186, 103 (2001). In one embodiment, a flavorant composition has a DEC from 1 to 3.5 (i.e., “low polarity”), alternatively a DEC from greater than 3.5 to 8 (i.e., “mid-polarity”), or a DEC from greater than 8, alternatively from greater than 8 to 15 (i.e., “high-polarity”). In another embodiment, the flavorant composition has a DEC from 1 to less than 6, alternatively the flavorant composition has a DEC from 6 to 8, alternatively still the flavorant composition has a DEC from 6 to 11. Water number (“WN”) is another test to measure flavor polarity. WN is defined as the grams of water needed to achieve permanent turbidity in a solution comprised of 10 grams flavorant composition and 30 grams of 1,2 hexanediol. In general, WN increases as a function of increasing polarity. WN for most flavor composition vary from around 20 to over 30 grams. In general, values higher than 30 are caused by incorporation of hydrophilic materials such as methyl salicylate, carvone, synthetic Cassia, eugenol, WS 23, MGA, or TK 10. “High Cool Exotic Orange” is an excellent example of a flavorant composition that has a low WN of 7.4 but has a high DEC of 12.6. Without wishing to be bound by theory, the high DEC is due to the presence of coolant agents and the low WN is caused by terpenes. This suggests that this flavorant composition will be more difficult to solubilize than “Cinnamint” that has a WN of 29.7 and a DEC of 12.3. In one embodiment, a flavorant composition has a WN from 1 to 79, from 1 to 50, or from 1 to 25. In another embodiment, a flavorant composition has a WN below 23 (i.e., “low polarity”), alternatively a WN from 1 to 23, or from 1 to 20, or from 1 to 17, or from 1 to 16, or from 1 to 15, or from 1 to 15, or from 15 and below. In another embodiment, the WN is from 23 to 35 (i.e., “mid-polarity”), alternatively a WN from 23 to 40, or from 23 to 30, or from 23 to 29. In yet another embodiment, the WN is greater than 45 (i.e., “high-polarity”), alternatively the WN is greater than 50, or 55, or 60, alternatively the WN is from 45 to 79. In another embodiment, the flavorant composition has a WN less than 30, alternatively less than 29, or 28, 27, 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, 21, or 21, or at least 1, or 2, 3, alternatively from 1 to 30, and combination thereof. The individual flavor ingredients (that comprise a flavorant composition) of the present invention may be defined by their octanol/water partition coefficient (“P”). The octanol/water partition coefficient of a flavor ingredient is the ratio between its equilibrium concentrations in octanol and in water. The partition coefficients of flavorant ingredients may more conveniently be given in the form of its logarithm to the base 10, log P. The log P values of many flavorant ingredients have been reported. See, e.g., the Pomona 92 database, available from Daylight Chemical Information Systems, Inc. (“Daylight CIS”), Irvine, Calif. However, the log P values are most conveniently calculated by the Biobyte C log P program contained in Daylight Software version 4.94, also available for license from Daylight CIS. This program also lists experimental log P values when they are available in the Pomona92 database. The calculated log P (“C log P”) is determined by the fragment approach of Hansch and Leo (cf, A. Leo, in Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry, vol. 4, C. Hansch, P. G. Sammens, J. B. Taylor and C. A. Ramsden, Eds., p. 295, Pergamon Press, 1990). The fragment approach is based on the chemical structure of each flavorant ingredient, and takes into account the numbers and types of atoms, the atom connectivity, and chemical bonding. The C log P values, which are the most reliable and widely used estimates for this physicochemical property, are preferably used instead of the experimental log P values in the selection of flavorant ingredients to comprise a flavorant composition. The C log P values may be defined by the amount of weight percentage of flavorant ingredients below 2.77 C log P. Generally, the greater amount of flavorant ingredients below 2.77 C log P, generally lower the polarity and thus more difficult to solubilize. In one embodiment, the flavorant composition comprises at least 10% by weight of the flavorant composition of one or more flavor components having a Calculated Logarithm of base 10 of octanol/water Partition coefficient (C log P) of less than 2.77, or at least 20 wt %, or at least 30 wt %, or at least 40 wt % of the flavorant components having C log P less than 2.77. Humectants The oral care composition comprises from 0.1% to 3% of a first humectant comprising of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) having an average molecular weight range of from 300 Da to 8,000 Da. In an embodiment, the oral care composition comprises from 0.5% to 2%, or 0.75% to 1.5% of a first humectants. In another embodiment, the PEGs have an average molecular weight range of from 300 Da to 1,000 Da, 300 Da to 800 Da, or 300 Da to 600 Da. Such low molecular weight PEGs are commercially available from such suppliers as Dow Chemical and BASF (New Jersey, USA). Applicants have surprisingly discovered that adding low molecular weight PEGs, as described above, it is possible to increase the flavorants' solubility and efficiently reduce oil droplet sizes of the emulsions to ensure sufficient phase stability and/or shelf-life for the oral care composition. Without wishing to be bound by theory, Applicants believe that low molecular weight PEGs, as co-surfactants, can join and modify emulsion packing pattern between flavorants and surfactants to increase the flavorants solubility and reduce the resulting droplet sizes. Alternatively, low molecular weight PEGs may likely strike an oil droplets. The oral care composition may further comprising from 35% to 60%, from 40% to 55%, or from 40% to 50%, or combinations thereof, of at least one secondary humectant selected from the group consisting of sorbitol, glycerin, xylitol, butylenes glycol, propylene glycol, trimethyl glycine, and mixtures thereof. In an embodiment, the secondary humectants comprises from 40% to 55% by weight of the oral care composition of sorbitol. Thickening Agents The oral care compositions herein may include one or more thickening agents or binders to provide a number of benefits such as, for example, a desirable consistency of the oral care composition, desirable active release characteristics upon use, acceptable shelf-life stability (greater than 4 months to 24 months, or longer), acceptable phase stability (greater than 4 months to 24 months, or longer), and/or suitable viscosity of the oral care composition to reduce and/or prevent acceleration of the oil droplets contained therein. Thickening agents and binders together can form a thickener system. Thickener system present in the oral care composition is in the range from about 0.01% to about 5%, from 0.1% to 3%, or from 1.0% to 2.5%, and comprises a combination of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), and carrageenan. In an embodiment, the CMC is sodium carboxymethyl cellulose. For instance, one commercially available form of CMC is CMC 2000S available from CPKelco. In another embodiment, the carrageenan may be selected from the group consisting of Kappa-carrageenan, Iota-carrageenan, Lambda-carrageenan, and combinations thereof. In another embodiment, the HEC has an average molecular weight range of 90,000 g/mol to 1,300,000 g/mol and an average degree of polymerization from 300 to 4,800. Although increasing thickening agent is one way to improve physical stability, it is not preferred as this approach may slow down the surfactant dispersion and foaming rate, and flavor release rate. pH The pH of the oral care composition may be between 4 to 11, from 5 to 10, or 6 to 8. Alternatively, the pH can be greater than 6, alternatively greater than 7, alternatively from 8 to 10, or combinations thereof. The pH is typically measured using a ratio of 1:3 of paste:water, whereby 1 gram of the oral care composition (e.g., toothpaste) is mixed into 3 grams of deionized water, and then the pH is assessed with a industry accepted pH probe that is calibrated under ambient conditions. The pH is measured by a pH meter with Automatic Temperature Compensating (ATC) probe. The pH meter is capable of reading to 0.001 pH unit. After each usage the electrode should be washed free from the sample solution with water. Remove any excess water by wiping with a tissue, such as Kimwipes or equivalent. When electrode is not in use, keep electrode tip immersed in pH 7 buffer solution or electrode storage solution.
