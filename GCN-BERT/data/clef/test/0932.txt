BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Lignocellulosic biomass represents a renewable source of carbohydrate for biological conversion into fuels and chemicals and, as such, presents an attractive alternative to petroleum-based technology (Arntzen and Dale, 1999). It is recognized, however, that to reach its full potential, commodity production of ethanol from biomass will require high rates and efficiencies, simple processes, and inexpensive media (Ingram et al. 1998; Zhang & Greasham 1999). Bacteria such as Escherichia coli have the native ability to metabolize all sugar constituents contained in lignocellulose. To realize fully the potential of recombinant ethanologenic bacterial strains to serve as a source of ethanol, there is a need for new and improved strains of such bacteria that can efficiently produce ethanol. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based, at least in part, on the discovery of a new strategy for metabolic engineering of bacteria for ethanol production. In particular, the invention provides engineering strategies for the production of ethanol in urea containing media. Accordingly in one aspect, the invention provides recombinant ethanologenic bacteria comprising a urease gene and wherein the expression of the mgsA gene is decreased as compared to expression in a reference bacterium. In one embodiment, the recombinant bacteria further comprises one of more genes naturally found in a urease operon. In one embodiment, the urease operon comprises the ureD, A, B, C, E, F and G genes and the recombinant bacteria of the invention may contain one or more of these genes. For example, the recombinant bacteria of the invention may comprise ureA, B, and C.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In order for the full scope of the invention to be clearly understood, the following definitions are provided. I. Definitions The terms “host” and “host bacterium” are used interchangeably and are intended to include a bacterium, e.g., a naturally occurring bacterium or a recombinant bacterium, which serves as a host cell from which a recombinant bacterium of the invention is produced. Hence the recombinant bacterium of the invention is said to be “derived from” the host bacterium. The term “derived from” as in “polynucleotide or gene derived from a bacterium” is intended to include the isolation (in whole or in part) of a polynucleotide segment from the indicated source (i.e., the bacterium) or the purification of a polypeptide from an indicated source (i.e., the bacterium). In this regard, the term is intended to include, for example, direct cloning, PCR amplification, or artificial synthesis from, or based on, a sequence associated with the indicated polynucleotide source. As used herein the terms “recombinant bacterium,” “recombinant host cell,” “recombinant microorganism,” and the like, are intended to include cells suitable for, or subjected to, genetic manipulation, or to incorporate heterologous polynucleotide sequences by transfection. The cell can be a microorganism or a higher eukaryotic cell. The term is intended to include progeny of the host cell originally transfected. In some embodiments, the host cell is a bacterial cell, e.g., a Gram-positive bacterial cell or a Gram-negative bacterial cell. Gram-positive bacterial host cells include, e.g., Bacillus, Clostridium, Zymomonas, Corynebacterium, Geobacillis, Lactobacillis, Lactococcus, Oenococcus, Streptococcus and Eubacterium. Gram-negative bacterial host cells include all facultatively anaerobic Gram-negative cells of the family Enterobacteriaceae such as Escherichia, Shigella, Citrobacter, Salmonella, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Erwinia, Kluyvera, Serratia, Cedecea, Morganella, Hafnia, Edwardsiella, Providencia, Proteus, and Yersinia. Preferred recombinant hosts are Escherichia coli and Klebsiella oxytoca cells. A “gene,” as used herein, is a nucleic acid that can direct synthesis of an enzyme or other polypeptide molecule, e.g., can comprise coding sequences, for example, a contiguous open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a polypeptide, or can itself be functional in the organism. A gene in an organism can be clustered in an operon, as defined herein, wherein the operon is separated from other genes and/or operons by intergenic DNA. Individual genes contained within an operon can overlap without intergenic DNA between the individual genes. In addition, the term “gene” is intended to include a specific gene for a selected purpose. A gene can be endogenous to the host cell or can be recombinantly introduced into the host cell, e.g., as a plasmid maintained episomally or a plasmid (or fragment thereof) that is stably integrated into the genome. A heterologous gene is a gene that is introduced into a cell and is not native to the cell. In accordance with the invention, a heterologous gene also includes an endogenous gene that is introduced into the cell at a location other than its natural location in the genome of the cell. The term “heterologous ethanol production gene” is intended to include a gene or portion thereof that is derived from any source, e.g., eukaryotes, prokaryotes, archaea, virii, or synthetic nucleic acid fragments, that encodes a polypeptide involved in the production of ethanol as a primary fermentation production, and that is incorporated into a host cell to which the gene is not native. The term “heterologous ethanol fermentation gene” also refers to a gene that encodes a polypeptide involved in the fermentation of a carbohydrate, for example in a metabolic pathway of an organism that produces ethanol as the primary fermentation produced by an organism, that is not naturally occurring in an organism, e.g., a gene that is introduced into the organism. The terms “heterologous ethanol production gene” and “heterologous ethanol fermentation gene” may be used interchangeably and are intended to include a gene that is involved in at least one step in the bioconversion of a carbohydrate to ethanol. Accordingly, the term is intended to include any gene encoding a polypeptide such as an alcohol dehydrogenase, a pyruvate decarboxylase, a secretory protein/s, or a polysaccharase e.g., a glucanase, such as an endoglucanase or exoglucanase, a cellobiohydrolase, β-glucosidase, endo-1,4-β-xylanase, β-xylosidase, α-glucuronidase, α-L-arabinofuranosidase, acetylesterase, acetylxylanesterase, α-amylase, β-amylase, glucoamylase, pullulanase, β-glucanase, hemicellulase, arabinosidase, mannanase, pectin hydrolase, or pectate lyase. The phrase “ethanol production genes” is meant to include substantially all the genes that have evolved in an ethanologenic organism, from which the heterologous ethanol production genes are obtained/derived, that comprise the organism's natural ethanol production pathway. For example, the ethanol production genes of Zymomonas mobilis, an ethanologenic bacterium, includes the pdc, adhA and adhB genes. The ethanol production genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an ethanologenic yeast, includes four or five different adh genes, for example alcohol dehydrogenase I, II, III and IV (adh I-IV) (Drewke et al. 1988; Reid et al. 1994), and 2 different pdc genes. In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the recombinant E. coli KO11 (ATCC 55124) (Ohta et al. 1991) can be used as a host cell. The terms “inactivated” or “inactivate” are intended to include any means by which a gene is stopped from encoding its intended polypeptide or from encoding an active form of its intended polypeptide. Accordingly, the terms include, for example, mutation, deletion, insertion, duplication, missense, frameshift, repeat, nonsense mutation, or other alteration or modification such that gene activity (i.e. transcription) is blocked. For example, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, one or more genes encoding polypeptides that interfere with or otherwise reduce the amount of ethanol produced by the ethanol production genes are inactivated by deletion. As used herein, “decreasing” or “decreases” or “decreased” refers to decreasing by at least 5%, for example, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 99 or 100%, for example, as compared to the decreased level of expression of the msgA gene in a bacterium, as compared to a reference bacterium. The terms also refer to, for example, decreased expression of one or more genes in the frd operon or decreased expression of the ldhA gene, as compared to a reference bacterium. As used herein, “decreasing” or “decreases” or “decreased” also means decreases by at least 1-fold, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 200, 500, 1000-fold or more, for example, as compared to the level of expression of the msgA gene in a bacterium, as compared to a reference bacterium. The terms also refer to, for example, decreased expression of one or more genes in the frd operon or decreased expression of the ldhA gene, as compared to a reference bacterium. “Decreased” or “reduced” also means eliminated such that there is no detectable level of activity, expression, etc., for example no detectable level of expression of the msgA gene, one or more genes in the frd operon, or the ldhA gene. As used herein, “activity” refers to the activity of a gene, for example the level of transcription of a gene. “Activity” also refers to the activity of an mRNA, for example, the level of translation of an mRNA. “Activity” also refers to the activity of a protein, for example MsgA.

As used herein, “expression” as in “expression of msgA” also refers to the expression of detectable levels of the mRNA transcript corresponding to the msgA gene. As used herein, “expression” as in “expression of ldhA” also refers to the expression of detectable levels of the mRNA transcript corresponding to the ldhA gene. “Altering”, as it refers to expression levels, means decreasing expression of a gene, mRNA or protein of interest, for example the msgA gene or the ldhA gene. As used herein, “not expressed” means there are no detectable levels of the product of a gene or mRNA of interest, for example, msgA or ldhA mRNA.

The term “simultaneous saccharification and fermentation” or “SSF” is intended to include the use of one or more recombinant hosts (or extracts thereof, including purified or unpurified extracts) for the contemporaneous degradation or depolymerization of a complex sugar and bioconversion of that sugar residue into ethanol by fermentation. SSF is a well-known process that can be used for breakdown of biomass to polysaccharides that are ultimately convertible to ethanol by bacteria. Reflecting the breakdown of biomass as it occurs in nature, SFF combines the activities of fungi (or enzymes such as cellulases extracted from fungi) with the activities of ethanologenic bacteria (or enzymes derived therefrom) to break down sugar sources such as lignocellulose to simple sugars capable of ultimate conversion to ethanol. SSF reactions are typically carried out at acid pH to optimize the use of the expensive fungal enzymes. The term “homologous recombination” refers to the crossing over of DNA that occurs between two homologous DNA molecules. According to the invention, homologous recombination can occur between genes to restore gene function, i.e. homologous recombination to restore pflB function. In another embodiment, homologous recombination can be used to remove an antibiotic resistance marker. The terms “saccharide,” “saccharide source,” “oligosaccharide source,” “oligosaccharide,” “complex cellulose,” “complex carbohydrate,” “complex sugar,” “polysaccharide,” “sugar source,” “source of a fermentable sugar” and the like are intended to include any carbohydrate source comprising more than one sugar molecule. Sugars include glucose, xylose, arabinose, mannose, galactose, sucrose, and lactose. The term “saccharide,” as used herein, also includes, e.g., disaccharides, trisaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides. These carbohydrates may be derived from any unprocessed plant material or any processed plant material. Examples are wood, paper, pulp, plant derived fiber, or synthetic fiber comprising more than one linked carbohydrate moiety, i.e., one sugar residue. One particular saccharide source is “lignocellulose,” which represents approximately 90% of the dry weight of most plant material and contains carbohydrates, e.g., cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, and aromatic polymers, e.g., lignin. Cellulose makes up 30%-50% of the dry weight of lignocellulose and is a homopolymer of cellobiose (a dimer of glucose). Similarly, hemicellulose makes up 20%-50% of the dry weight of lignocellulose and is a complex polymer containing a mixture of pentose (xylose, arabinose) and hexose (glucose, mannose, galactose) sugars which contain acetyl and glucuronyl side chains. Pectin makes up 1%-20% of the dry weight of lignocellulose and is a methylated homopolymer of glucuronic acid. Other saccharide sources include carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), amorphous cellulose (e.g., acid-swollen cellulose), and the cellooligosaccharides cellobiose, cellotriose, cellotetraose, and cellopentaose. Cellulose, e.g., amorphous cellulose may be derived from a paper or pulp source (including, e.g., fluid wastes thereof) or, e.g., agricultural byproducts such as corn stalks, soybean solubles, or beet pulp. Any one or a combination of the above carbohydrate polymers is a potential source of sugars for depolymerization and subsequent bioconversion to ethanol by fermentation according to the products and methods of the present invention. The term “obtaining” as in “obtaining the recombinant bacterium” is intended to include purchasing, preparing, engineering or otherwise acquiring the recombinant bacterium. The term “providing” as in “providing the recombinant bacterium” is intended to include selling, distributing or otherwise making available the recombinant bacterium. “ATCC” followed by a number appearing in parentheses following an organism name refers to a deposit of the organism made with the American Type Culture Collection, 10801 University Blvd. Manassas, Va. 20110-2209. “NRRL” followed by a number appearing in parentheses following an organism name refers to a deposit of the organism made with the ARS Culture Collection, located at the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research, 1815 N. University St. Peoria, Ill. 61604. II. Recombinant Cells As discussed, the invention provides new and recombinant cells, in particular recombinant bacteria, suitable for degrading sugars and/or producing ethanol. The cells have improved ethanol production capabilities, particularly. The cells comprise ethanol production genes, urease genes and the deletion of mgsA. The cell can also be a cell of a single-celled or multi-cellular microorganism, such as a fungus, yeast, or bacterium. The recombinant host cells and recombinant cells derived thereform are intended to include cells suitable for, or subjected to, genetic manipulation, or to incorporate heterologous polynucleotide sequences by transfection. Recombinant host cells include progeny of the host cell originally transfected. Accordingly, suitable host cells in accordance with the invention include yeast cells such as, e.g., Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Other yeast cells in accordance with the invention include, e.g., Saccharomyces, Schizosacharomyces, Hansenula, Pachyosolen, Kluyveromyces, Debaryomyces, Yarrowia, and Pichia. The host cell can be a non-recombinant or recombinant bacterial host cell. In certain embodiments, bacterial host cells in accordance with the invention include Gram-positive bacteria, e.g., Bacillus, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, Geobacillis, Lactobacillis, Lactococcus, Oenococcus, Streptococcus and Eubacterium. In other embodiments, bacterial host cells include Gram-negative bacteria and include, for example, Acinetobacter, Gluconobacter, Escherichia, Zymomonas, Geobacter, Shewanella, Salmonella, Shigella, Eneterobacter, Citrobacter, Erwinia, Serratia, Proteus, Hafnia, Yersinia, Morganella, Edwardsiella, and Klebsiella. Exemplary bacterial host cells in accordance with the invention include non-recombinant bacteria such as, e.g., Escherichia coli B or Escherichia coli W. As discussed, the invention provides recombinant cells, in particular recombinant bacteria, comprising ethanol production genes. The recombinant bacteria of the invention are able to produced ethanol as the primary fermentation product. The organisms contain ethanol production genes. Included within the scope of the invention are heterologous ethanol production genes derived from yeast and Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. Thus, suitable heterologous polynucleotide sequences for use in constructing recombinant organisms in accordance with the invention are derived from, e.g., adh and/or pdc genes from naturally occurring ethanologenic organisms, such as Zymomonas mobilis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as Zymobacter palmae, Acetobacter pasteurianus and Sarcinia ventriculi (WO2003/025117 and herein incorporated by reference; Talarico et al. 2005.). Other naturally occurring ethanologenic organisms from which ethanol production genes can be derived for use in the invention include fungi and most plants. One or more of the ethanol production genes can be derived from different organisms or from the same organisms. In advantageous embodiments, the genes are derived from the same organism. In one embodiment of the invention, the genes comprising the ous ethanol production genes are pdc, adhA and adhB. In an advantageous embodiment, the pdc, adhA and adhB genes are from Zymomonas mobilis, a naturally occurring ethanologenic bacterium. Included within the scope of the invention are heterologous ethanol production genes or gene products which differ from naturally-occurring ethanol production genes, for example, genes which have nucleic acids that are mutated, inserted or deleted, but which encode polypeptides substantially similar and functionally equivalent to the naturally-occurring gene products of the present invention, e.g., a mutant polypeptide having pyruvate decarboxylase activity that serves to direct the flow of pyruvate into ethanol during fermentation. For example, it is well understood to one of skill in the art that nucleic acids which code for conservative amino acid substitutions can be mutated (e.g., by substitution). It is further well understood to one of skill in the art that amino acids in the naturally occurring gene products can be substituted, added or deleted to a certain degree without substantially affecting the function of a gene product (e.g., without affecting the biological function of pyruvate decarboxylase as an enzyme that serves to direct the flow of pyruvate into ethanol during fermentation) as compared with a naturally-occurring gene product. These well understood principles are included within the scope of the present invention. Thus, although in some embodiments, the ethanol production genes can comprise, for example, the naturally occurring pdc, adhA and adhB genes of Zymomonas mobilis, one or more genes can be mutated forms of naturally occurring ethanol production genes, e.g., Zymomonas mobilis ethanol production genes. In other aspects, the invention provides a recombinant bacterium which comprises ethanol production genes as herein before described, wherein one or more antibiotic markers are removed. In general, genes encoding antibiotic markers are used in recombinant engineering techniques to identify or mark the presence of a particular genotype/phenotype. In certain embodiments, recombinant organisms of the invention which produce ethanol as the primary fermentation product can be inhibited by the presence of antibiotic markers. Therefore, such antibiotic markers are advantageously removed from the recombinant organisms. In some embodiments, antibiotic markers targeted for removal include, e.g., those selected from the group consisting of apramycin, kanamycin, tetracycline, ampicillin and chloramphenicol. In certain embodiments, apramycin and kanamycin markers are removed. In other embodiments, the organism contain a selectable marker that is a non-antibiotic maker, e.g., green fluorescent protein. In another embodiment, a msgA gene is inactivated by deletion. This gene encodes a protein involved in the Methylglyoxal Bypass, a spillover pathway which is a potential source of lactate in E. coli and which slows glycolysis and macromolecular synthesis (Totemeyer et al. 1998, Zhu et al. 2001). In other aspects, the invention provides a recombinant bacterium which comprises ethanol production genes as hereinbefore described, and which further comprises urease genes. For example, the recombinant bacterium contains the K. oxytoca urease operon comprising ureDABCEFG genes. Such genes can be endogenous or heterologous and are integrated into the host cell by any number of techniques well known to those of skill in the art. Exemplary recombinant organisms in accordance with the invention are novel E. coli strain SD7. This strain was deposited with the NRRL on Jun. 16, 2010 and assigned NRRL accession number B-50394). In accordance with an embodiment of the invention, these novel E. coli strains are produced from the recombinant E. coli KO11 (ATCC 55124) (Ohta et al. 1991), which is used as the host cell. Methods for producing these novel strains are described in the examples below. III. Methods of Making The present invention provides methods of making the recombinant organisms having the aforementioned attributes. Accordingly, in another aspect, the invention provides a method for producing a recombinant bacterium that comprises ethanol production genes and urease genes, and also have an inactivated msgA gene. Methods of making recombinant ethanologenic microorganisms are known in the art of molecular biology. Suitable materials and methods and recombinant host organisms are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,026,152, 6,849,434, 6,333,181, 5,821,093; 5,482,846; 5,424,202; 5,028,539; 5,000,000; 5,487,989, 5,554,520, and 5,162,516 and in WO2003/025117 hereby incorporated by reference, and may be employed in carrying out the present invention. The genes include a nucleic acid molecule (e.g., a DNA molecule or segment thereof), for example, a polypeptide or RNA-encoding nucleic acid molecule that, in an organism, is separated from another gene or other genes, by intergenic DNA (i.e., intervening or spacer DNA which naturally flanks the gene and/or separates genes in the chromosomal DNA of the organism). A gene can direct synthesis of an enzyme or other polypeptide molecule (e.g., can comprise coding sequences, for example, a contiguous open reading frame (ORF) which encodes a polypeptide) or can itself be functional in the organism. A gene in an organism can be clustered in an operon, as defined herein, wherein the operon is separated from other genes and/or operons by intergenic DNA. Individual genes contained within an operon can overlap without intergenic DNA between the individual genes. Also included in the scope of the invention are promoterless operons, which are operons lacking the promoter portion (e.g., an frd or ure operon). An isolated gene as described herein, includes a gene which is essentially free of sequences which naturally flank the gene in the chromosomal DNA of the organism from which the gene is derived (i.e., is free of adjacent coding sequences which encode a second or distinct polypeptide or RNA molecule, adjacent structural sequences or the like) and optionally includes 5′ and 3′ regulatory sequences, for example promoter sequences and/or terminator sequences. An isolated gene includes predominantly coding sequences for a polypeptide (e.g., sequences which encode PDC polypeptides). In some embodiments, the parent strain is a non-recombinant bacterium. For example, the parent strain can be a naturally occurring non-ethanologenic bacterium, e.g., E. coli W. In other embodiments of the invention, the parent strain can be a recombinant organism. Exemplary host cells for use in the methods according to the invention include, e.g., E. coli strains B, W, KO4 (ATCC 55123), KO11 (ATCC 55124), and KO12 (ATCC 55125), and Klebsiella oxytoca strain P2 (ATCC 55307) (U.S. Pat. No. 5,821,093). Other examples of suitable host cells include E. coli (ATCC 11303), E. coli DH5α, E. coli C, E. coli K12, E. coli KO4 (ATCC 55123), E. coli LY01 (ATCC PTA-3466), E. coli W (ATCC 9637), and K. oxytoca M5A1 (ATCC 68564). In yet another embodiment, the method further comprises removing one or more antibiotic markers. In one embodiment, the antibiotic markers are selected from the group consisting of apramycin, kanamycin, tetracycline, ampicillin and chloramphenicol. In a particular embodiment, the antibiotic markers are apramycin and kanamycin. The antibiotic marker can be removed by inactivating (e.g., by deletion) the gene coding for the marker by any of a number of methods known in the art. In an advantageous embodiment, the gene(s) encoding the antibiotic marker(s), e.g., kanamycin and apramycin, is removed by homologous recombination, using a recombinase. In yet another embodiment, the method further comprises adding one or more screenable markers, e.g., a marker such as green fluorescent protein. In yet another embodiment, the method further comprises inactivating one or more genes encoding polypeptides that interfere with or otherwise reduce the amount of ethanol produced by the ethanol production genes. In accordance with the invention, such genes are inactivated by any of a number of means, well known to those of skill in the art, by which a gene is stopped from encoding its intended polypeptide or from encoding an active form of its intended polypeptide. Accordingly, such genes are inactivated by, for example, mutation, deletion, insertion, duplication, missense, frameshift, repeat, nonsense mutation, or other alteration or modification such that gene activity (i.e., transcription) is blocked or transcription results in functionally inactive polypeptides. In accordance with advantageous embodiments of the invention, genes are inactivated by deletion. In a further embodiment, the method further comprises integrating one or more heterologous genes that encode polypeptides that facilitate production of ethanol or otherwise increase the amount of ethanol produced by the ethanol production genes. The very same methods described above that are used to integrate the ethanol production genes can be used to integrate genes that encode polypeptides that facilitate production of ethanol or otherwise increase the amount of ethanol produced by the microorganism. It is understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the aforementioned genetic changes to the bacteria of the invention can be carried out in any order and that the order of adding genes or decreasing the expression of genes can be varied but still result in the recombinant bacteria of the invention. One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that based on the aforementioned examples, and based on homology among bacterial strains, the methods of the invention are not limited to the strains taught in the instant application. IV. Methods of Use Methods for Producing Ethanol The recombinant bacteria of the invention produce ethanol from an oligosaccharide source. Accordingly, the invention provides a method for producing ethanol from an oligosaccharide source comprising contacting said oligosaccharide with a recombinant bacterium of the invention under conditions appropriate for ethanol production, thereby producing ethanol from an oligosaccharide source. In accordance with the methods of the invention, the recombinant bacteria described herein degrade or depolymerize a complex saccharide into a monosaccharide. Subsequently, the recombinant bacteria, catabolize the simpler sugar into ethanol by fermentation. Typically, fermentation conditions are selected that provide an optimal pH and temperature for promoting the best growth kinetics of the producer host cell strain and catalytic conditions for the enzymes produced by the culture (Doran et al., (1993) Biotechnol. Progress. 9:533-538). A variety of exemplary fermentation conditions are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,487,989 and 5,554,520. In certain embodiments, optimal conditions included temperatures ranging from about 25 to about 43° C. and a pH ranging from about 4.5 to 8.0. Other conditions are discussed in the Examples. Moreover, it will be appreciated by the skilled artisan that only routine experimentation is needed, using techniques known in the art, for optimizing a given fermentation reaction of the invention. Currently, the conversion of a complex saccharide such as lignocellulose is a very involved, multi-step process. For example, the lignocellulose must first be degraded or depolymerized using acid hydrolysis. This is followed by steps that separate liquids from solids and these products are subsequently washed and detoxified to result in cellulose that can be further depolymerized and finally, fermented by a suitable ethanologenic host cell. In contrast, the fermenting of corn is much simpler in that amylases can be used to break down the corn starch for immediate bioconversion by an ethanologenic host in essentially a one-step process. Accordingly, it will be appreciated by the skilled artisan that the recombinant hosts and methods of the invention afford the use of a similarly simpler and more efficient process for fermenting lignocellulose. For example, the method of the invention is intended to encompass a method that avoids acid hydrolysis altogether. Moreover, the hosts of the invention have the following advantages, 1) efficiency of pentose and hexose co-fermentation; 2) resistance to toxins; 3) production of enzymes for simultaneous saccharification and fermentation; and 4) environmental hardiness. Therefore, the complexity of depolymerizing lignocellulose can be simplified using an improved biocatalyst of the invention. One advantage of the invention is the ability to use a saccharide source that has been, heretofore, underutilized. Consequently, a number of complex saccharide substrates may be used as a starting source for depolymerization and subsequent fermentation using the recombinant bacteria and methods of the invention. Ideally, a recyclable resource may be used in the SSF process. Mixed waste office paper is a preferred substrate (Brooks et al., (1995) Biotechnol. Progress. 11:619-625; Ingram et al., (1995) U.S. Pat. No. 5,424,202), and is much more readily digested than acid pretreated bagasse (Doran et al., (1994) Biotech. Bioeng. 44:240-247) or highly purified crystalline cellulose (Doran et al. (1993) Biotechnol. Progress. 9:533-538). Glucanases, both endoglucanases and exoglucanases, contain a cellulose binding domain, and these enzymes can be readily recycled for subsequent fermentations by harvesting the undigested cellulose residue using centrifugation (Brooks et al., (1995) Biotechnol. Progress. 11:619-625). Such approaches work well with purified cellulose, although the number of recycling steps may be limited with substrates with a higher lignin content. Other substrate sources that are within the scope of the invention include any type of processed or unprocessed plant material, e.g., lawn clippings, husks, cobs, stems, leaves, fibers, pulp, hemp, sawdust, newspapers, etc. EXEMPLIFICATION The invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which should not be construed as limiting. Example 1 Preparation of E. coli SD7 Materials and Methods Chromosomal DNA was prepared from E. coli SD7 by growing an overnight culture on Luria broth, harvesting the cells, and treating the cells with reagents to lyse the cell membrane and release the DNA. After a phenol-chloroform step to eliminate cell proteins, the DNA was precipitated and resuspended in buffer for use in the PCR reactions. The following PCR primer sets and conditions were used to amplify the region encompassing each of the modifications introduced into E. coli SD7. The expected size of the PCR product is indicated for each. introduction of K. oxytoca Product Set 1 urease operon size Forward 5′ CAGCAGCGAAACTGTTTGCCA 3′ 5.4 kb (SEQ ID NO: 8) Reverse 5′ GTGCGATGTGGTTTGTAGGCATGAT 3′ (SEQ ID NO: 9) Set 2 deletion of the mgsA gene Forward 5′ TGATGGCAGATGACAGTACGCTG 3′ 0.5 kb (SEQ ID NO: 10) Reverse 5′ GGCAACAGGCGGATTACGTCA 3′ (SEQ ID NO: 11) PCR Cycling Conditions for Amplification were as Follows: Step 1 95° C. 5 minutes Step 2 95° C. 30 seconds Step 3 55° C. 30 seconds Step 4 68° C. 1 minute per kb of expected product Repeat steps 2-4 34 times Step 5 68° C. 7 minutes All PCR reactions resulted in products of the expected size as analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Each of the PCR products were purified using a spin column method (Qiaquick columns, Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) and treated with Exo-SapIT (US Biochemicals, Cleveland, Ohio) to prepare for sequencing by the dideoxy chain termination method. Results and Conclusions Removal of Alcohol Gene Cassette from E. Coli KO11-RD1. E. coli KO11-RD1, contains an alcohol gene cassette. The complete removal of the alcohol gene cassette by recombination was carried out by the two-step, recombinational method and should result in the complete restoration of the wild-type pflB gene, the original site of insertion. The nucleotide sequence of this region was determined, following PCR amplification, and found to be identical to that found in parental strain E. coli W. The nucleotide sequence of the E. coli SD5 pflB region is shown in FIG. 1. Deletion of the frdABCD Operon. E. coli is capable of producing succinate as a fermentation product through the actions of the fumarate reductase, encoded by frdABCD. E. coli KO11-RD1 contains an insertion of bacteriophage Mu sequences in the frdA gene that eliminates succinate production but is capable of reversion. A complete and precise deletion of the entire frdABCD operon and removal of the inserted Mu sequences was carried out by the two-step, recombinational method. Confirmation of the deletion and removal was obtained by PCR amplification and nucleotide sequencing of this region. The resultant sequence is shown in FIG. 2. Deletion of Lactate Dehydrogenase Gene ldhA. The lactate dehydrogenase gene, ldhA, was deleted to eliminate production of lactate by fermentation using the by the two-step, recombinational method. PCR amplification and nucleotide sequencing of the region confirmed the precise deletion of the gene. The resultant sequence is shown in FIG. 3. Introduction of the pdcEco-adhAEco-adhBEco-gfpEco Alcohol Operon into Ribosomal Operon H. An alcohol operon consisting of E. coli codon-optimized Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc), alcohol dehydrogenase I (adhA), alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhB) and green fluorescent protein (gfp) genes was introduced by the two-step, recombinational method into the 23S rrn gene of the ribosomal operon H. To confirm the location of the insertion site and the composition of the alcohol operon, a 10 kb PCR product was amplified and the nucleotide sequence determined. A smaller portion of the sequence obtained shows the site of insertion and composition of the alcohol operon genes (FIG. 4). Deletion of Bacteriophage Wφ gpN. To eliminate bacteriophage Wφ production, the major capsid gene gpN was deleted by the two-step, recombinational method. Confirmation of the deletion was carried out by PCR amplification and nucleotide sequencing of this region. The resultant sequence is shown in FIG. 5. Insertion of the Klebsiella oxytoca Urease Operon. To introduce the K. oxytoca M5A1 urease operon into E. coli SD5 to enable the use of urea as an alternative nitrogen source, a 5 kb PCR product was generated from K. oxytoca M5A1 chromosomal DNA and ligated into a plasmid consisting of the pMEV vector and flanking E. coli W sequences from the downstream end of the proVWX operon. The constructed plasmid was used to introduce the urease operon into E. coli SD6 by the two-step, recombinational method. The introduction was confirmed by PCR and nucleotide sequencing. The resultant sequence is shown in FIG. 6. Deletion of the Methylglyoxal Synthase Gene, mgsA. To delete the mgsA gene and eliminate methylglyoxal and residual lactate production, a region of the E. coli W genome sequence flanking the mgsA open reading frame was used to design and synthesize a DNA fragment that was then cloned into pMEV. The deletion was introduced by the two-step, recombinational method and confirmed by PCR analysis and nucleotide sequencing. The resultant sequence is shown in FIG. 7. Example 2 Preparation and Characterization of E. coli SD7 Escherichia coli SD7 is used to ferment C5 sugars from lignocellulosic biomass to ethanol. Escherichia coli SD7 is an intergeneric microorganism, and its identity is described in detail below. Taxonomic Information Recipient Organism The recipient microorganism is Escherichia coli W. The general taxonomy of E. coli is as follows: Name: Escherichia coli Kingdom: Bacteria Phylum: Proteobacteria Class: Gammaproteobacteria Order: Enterobacteriales Family: Enterobacteriaceae Genus: Escherichia Species: coli E. coli W is available from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC accession 9637) (ATCC, Accessed Jul. 9, 2007). New Microorganism E. coli SD7 was constructed via the following modifications starting from E. coli W. 1) Introduction of alcohol operon consisting of the Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase gene (pdc), Z. mobilis alcohol dehydrogenase II gene (adhB) and pBR325 chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene into the pflB gene (superseded by step 5). Resulted in strain KO3; 2) Amplification of alcohol operon copy number by selection for high-level chloramphenicol resistance. Resulted in strain KO4; 3) Insertional inactivation of the frdA gene to eliminate succinate production and introduction of 128 kb of homologous E. coli K12 DNA flanking mutation. (Superseded by step 6.) Resulted in strain KO11; 4) Adaptation to biomass hydrolysate through multiple passages on solid agar containing increasing concentrations of hydrolysate. Resulted in strain KO11-RD1; 5) Removal of alcohol operon and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (supersedes step 1). Resulted in strain SD1; 6) Deletion of frdABCD operon to eliminate succinate production (supersedes step 2). Resulted in strain SD2; 7) Deletion of lactate dehydrogenase gene, ldhA, to eliminate lactic acid production. Resulted in strain SD3; 8) Introduction of codon-optimized Z. mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase (pdc), alcohol dehydrogenase I (adhA), alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhB), and green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) into rrlH ribosomal operon. Resulted in strain SD4; and 9) Deletion of bacteriophage Wφ major capsid gene, gpN, to remove ability to produce infectious phage particles. Resulted in strain SD5. 10) Introduction of the Klebsiella oxytoca urease operon genes, ureDABCEFG, into the chromosome, downstream of the native proVWX operon. Resulted in strain SD6. 11) Deletion of methylglyoxal synthase gene, mgsA, to remove methylglyoxal and residual lactic acid production. Resulted in strain SD7. SD7 Morphological Features E. coli is a Gram-negative bacterium. The cells are straight rods occurring singly or in pairs (Holt, J. G. et al., 1994c). The integration of the decarboxylase gene (pdc) and the alcohol dehydrogenase I and II genes (adhA and adhB) from Zymomonas moblis and the green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) into E. coli W along with the deletion of the ldhA, frdABCD, and gpN genes changes the cell morphology. The cell morphology of E. coli SD7 differs only in length compared to E. coli W. When cultivated in Luria-Bertani broth, supplemented with 2% glucose, during log-phase growth, the E. coli W cells are 0.9 μm×2.6 μm-4.3 μm. The majority of E. coli SD7 cells are shorter, 0.9 μm×1.7 μm-3.4 μm, with some longer cells reaching 37 μm in length. The adaptation of one of the intermediates in the construction of E. coli SD7, KO11-RD1, to biomass hydrolysate resulted in a change in the colony morphology as compared to E. coli W. Where E. coli W colonies are flat and translucent, KO11-RD1 and its derivatives, including E. coli SD7, are raised and mucoidal. Physiological Features E. coli, including the W strain, is a facultative anaerobe and able to ferment hexose and pentose sugars to a variety of organic acids, ethanol and hydrogen (a process termed heterofermentation). The organic acids include formate, acetate, lactate, and succinate (August, B. et al., 1996). To eliminate the most significant organic acid by-products, i.e., lactate and succinate production, respectively, the fermentatative lactate dehydrogenase gene, ldhA, and the fumarate reductase operon, frdABCD, were deleted from SD7. To increase ethanol production, heterologous genes for the conversion of pyruvate to ethanol—consisting of the Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase gene (pdc), the alcohol dehydrogenase I gene (adhA), and the alcohol dehydrogenase II gene (adhB)—were introduced into E. coli SD7. While this strain retains the ability to produce acetate, formate, and hydrogen, it produces predominantly ethanol due to the increased flux of pyruvate to this end-product enabled by the introduction of the Z. mobilis genes. To enable the use of urea as an alternative nitrogen source, the urease operon from Klebsiella oxytoca M5A1, was cloned and introduced into the chromosome. Finally, to eliminate the production of methylglyoxal and residual lactic acid, the methylglyoxal synthase gene, mgsA, was deleted. Genetic Construction of the New Microorganism Taxonomy of Donor Organism The taxonomies of the donor organisms used in the construction of E. coli SD7 are described below. The donor microorganism providing the pyruvate decarboxylase gene (pdc), the alcohol dehydrogenase I gene (adhA), and the alcohol dehydrogenase II gene (adhB) is Zymomonas mobilis ZM4. The general taxonomy of Z. mobilis is as follows: Name: Zymomonas mobilis Kingdom: Bacteria Phylum: Proteobacteria Class: Alphaproteobacteria Order: Sphingomonadales Family: Sphingomonadaceae Genus: Zymomonas Species: mobilis The donor microorganism providing the urease operon, ureDABCEFG, is Klebsiella oxytoca M5A1. The general taxonomy of K. oxytoca is as follows: Name: Klebsiella oxytoca Kingdom: Bacteria Phylum: Proteobacteria Class: Gammaproteobacteria Order: Enterobacteriales Family: Enterobacteriaceae Genus: Klebsiella Species: oxytoca Description of Natural Traits Natural E. coli W, the recipient microorganism, was chosen because it has a history of safe use and is well-characterized. There is a large amount of information available on E. coli in terms of metabolism, physiology, and genetics. E. coli is able to metabolize a wide variety of substrates, including dissacharides, hexoses, pentoses, and sugar alcohols (Holt, J. G. et al., 1994c). These substrates are converted to a variety of organic acids, ethanol, and hydrogen. The organic acids include formate, acetate, lactate, and succinate (August, B. et al., 1996). E. coli is considered the most widely-used host for molecular genetics, so its culture and molecular manipulations are well-known. Added or Modified Although E. coli W is able to produce ethanol by fermentation through a heterofermentative process, the ability of E. coli SD7 to produce high levels of ethanol by homofermentation was introduced by the addition of E. coli codon-optimized (indicated by) Eco) Z. mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase and the alcohol dehydrogenase I and II genes. In addition, E. coli SD7 was modified to express low levels of green fluorescent protein by the introduction of the gfp gene to the pdc-adhA-adhB alcohol operon (further indicated as pdcEco-adhAEco-adhBEco-gfpEco in the remainder of this submission) in order to aid monitoring of operon expression. The ability of E. coli SD7 to produce lactate or succinate as fermentation side products was eliminated by the deletion of the ldhA and frdABCD genes, respectively. The ability of E. coli SD7 to produce Wφ phage particles was eliminated, while retaining immunity to superinfection, by deletion of the Wφ major capsid protein gene gpN. The ability of E. coli SD7 to use urea as an alternative nitrogen source was introduced by the addition of the urease operon, consisting of the ureDABCEFG genes, from Klebsiella oxytoca M5A1. The ability of SD7 to produce methylglyoxal and residual amounts of lactate were eliminated by deletion of the methylglyoxal synthase gene mgsA. Construction Details The Recipient Microorganism The recipient microorganism, E. coli W, is the progenitor of E. coli SD7 and a number of intermediate strains. E. coli SD7 was constructed for use in lignocellousic ethanol process and is derived from a previously modified strain E. coli KO11-RD1, which is a hydrolysate-resistance adapted derivative of KO11. E. coli KO11 has been extensively described in the literature and has been well-characterized for its ability to ferment pentose sugars to ethanol at high volume productivities (Asghari, A. et al., 1996). Although KO11 was originally described as having been generated from E. coli B, it has subsequently been shown to have been derived from E. coli W (ATCC 9637) (Jarboe, L. R. et al., 2007). The KO11-RD1 derivative is highly resistant to inhibitory components, such as furfural and hydroxymethyl furfural, found in the sugar liquor produced in the dilute acid/steam explosion pretreatment. In addition, the strain still retains properties such as the ability to produce fermentation side-products as well as ethanol. The steps taken to remedy these traits and to produce the new microorganism E. coli SD7 are described below. A lineage of the intermediates and the final strain is shown in FIGS. 8 and 9. Introduced DNA Sequences Since the construction of E. coli KO11 is well-described in the literature and our effort to create E. coli SD7 begins with the use of E. coli KO11-RD1, the following discussion will focus on the sequence of events between KO11-RD1, the hydrolysate adapted strain, and E. coli SD7, the new microorganism. Table 1 indicates all DNA added during the construction events between KO11-RD1 and SD7. TABLE 1 DNA Added During the Construction Events Between KO11-RD1 and SD7 Introduced Protein coding Length sequence or non-coding (bp) Description RBS-SD non-coding 14 Ribosome binding site pdcEco coding 1707 E. coli codon optimized Zymomonas mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase gene RBS-SD non-coding 14 Ribosome binding site adhAEco coding 1014 E. coli codon optimized Zymomonas mobilis alcohol dehydrogenase I gene RBS-SD non-coding 14 Ribosome binding site adhBEco coding 1152 E. coli codon-optimized Zymomonas mobilis alcohol dehydrogenase II gene RBS-SD non-coding 14 Ribosome binding site gfpEco coding 687 E. coli codon optimized green fluorescent protein gene terminator non-coding 28 Transcriptional terminator sequence ureDABCEFG coding 5048 Urease operon from Klebsiella oxytoca M5A1 Genetic Method for Introducing the Modifications to Create E. Coli SD7 and all Intermediate Strains. All chromosomal changes described here were generated using a conventional, i.e., well-known and broadly used, recombinational exchange strategy schematically described in FIGS. 10-12. The vector pMEV, which is used for the manipulation of the gene sequences and introduction of mutations into the chromosome, is described in FIG. 13. The vector pMEV consists of a conditional origin of replication, oriR6K, a selectable kanamycin resistance gene, kan, and a counter-selectable sucrose synthase gene, sacB. A DNA fragment is cloned into the BbsI site of the vector and replicated in an E. coli host able to recognize the oriR6K conditional origin of replication. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA fragment is verified by sequencing. The introduction of a change (which can be a deletion, insertion or modification) into the chromosome of the organism involves multiple steps, which are detailed in FIGS. 10-12. The first step is the electroporation of the pMEV vector containing cloned DNA into the recipient strain and selection for a recombinational co-integration event, which occurs between homologous flanking sequences in the chromosome and recombinant plasmid. The co-integration event results in kanamycin-resistant, bacterial colonies. The recombinational co-integration event can take place between flanking sequences on either side of the change to be introduced. (See FIGS. 10-12, 1° recombination.) The second step is the removal of the integrated vector sequences by selection for sucrose resistance. The sacB gene on the pMEV vector is a counter-selectable marker that confers sensitivity of a host to sucrose in the growth medium. Sucrose-resistant colonies arise from loss of the entire pMEV vector by a second recombination event between the duplicated homologous sequences (one copy derived from the endogenous chromosome and the second from the introduced sequence). If the recombination takes place between the same flanking sequences relative to the introduced change, the resultant strain “reverts” back to a wild-type strain, identical to the original parent (see FIGS. 10-12, 2° recombination B). If the recombination takes place on the opposite side of the flanking sequence relative to the introduced change, the resultant strain now contains the introduced change in replacement of the wild-type sequence (see FIGS. 10-12, 2° recombination A). These two possible events are determined by PCR amplification of DNA surrounding the putative site of change and verification of the correct change by nucleotide sequencing. Using this method, no pMEV vector sequences remain in the chromosome, and the resulting strain is sensitive to kanamycin. The process can be repeated to introduce additional modifications in the same manner. Genetic Construction of E. coli SD7 Removal of pdc-adhB-cat from E. coli KO11-RD1 To remove the alcohol operon, consisting of genes encoding the Z. mobilis pyruvate decarboxylase (pdcZm) and alcohol dehydrogenase II (adhBZm) and an associated chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) derived from pBR325 (from E. coli KO11-RD1), a DNA fragment internal to the adhBZm open reading frame was synthesized by PCR amplification and cloned into pMEV. Following the procedure described in FIG. 14, the pMEV-adhBZm plasmid was used to remove the pdcZm-adhBZm-cat genes from KO11-RD1, by two recombination events with the 2° recombination occurring between the outermost duplicated pflB sequences, selection for sucrose-resistance and screening for chloramphenicol sensitivity. The resultant strain, SD1 was shown to be absent the genes for pdcZm-adhBZm-cat and restored for the wild-type pflB by PCR and nucleotide sequencing. Deletion of the frdABCD Operon from SD1 The fumarate reductase of E. coli carries out the reductive conversion of fumarate to succinate and represents a side product of fermentation that would be desirable to remove to increase conversion of biomass derived sugars to ethanol (Ohta, K. et al., 1991). Although the literature describing the construction of E. coli KO11 indicates that the fumarate reductase operon frdABCD has been inactivated by deletion of sequences within the operon, the nucleotide sequence of this region, determined during the course of this work, showed instead that the mutation had arisen by an insertion event in the frdA gene. The inserted sequence (˜2196 bp) was found to have been derived from phage Mu, a remnant of sequence used in the original construction of an frd mutation in strain SE1706 (Iuchi, S. et al., 1985). Because Hfr conjugation was used to transfer DNA from SE1706, an E. coli K12 strain, to KO4, an E. coli W strain, K12 sequences in addition to the frd mutation have also been transferred to KO4. FIG. 15 shows the extent of the DNA transferred from SE1706 into KO4, and by extension, residing in KO11-RD1. To delete the entire frdABCD operon and to remove the remnant sequence of phage Mu, a DNA fragment was designed, synthesized to contain sequences exactly flanking the frdABCD open-reading frames, and cloned in to pMEV. The deletion was introduced, as described in FIG. 16, and verified by PCR and nucleotide sequencing. The resultant strain is SD2. Deletion of Lactate Dehydrogenase, ldhA, Gene E. coli and other heterofermentative organisms (defined as producing a variety of fermentation products) can produce lactic acid from sugars by fermentation (August, B. et al., 1996). To remove the ability of this organism to produce lactate as a side-product, a DNA sequence was designed and synthesized to delete the ldhA open-reading frame using E. coli K12 W3110 genome sequence as template. The fragment was cloned into pMEV and the deletion was introduced into the chromosome of SD2, as described in FIG. 17, and was verified by PCR and nucleotide sequencing. Because of the use of E. coli K12 sequence to design the DNA fragment for deletion of ldhA from SD2, the single base changes derived from the E. coli K12 sequence are noted in FIG. 17. None of these changes results in a sequence alteration of the encoded proteins in the corresponding open-reading frames. The resultant strain is SD3. Introduction of New pdcEco-adhAEco-adhBEco-gfpEco Alcohol Operon into SD3 As the original alcohol operon, pdcZm-adhBZm-cat, in E. coli KO11-RD1 had been removed, it was necessary to reintroduce a comparable alcohol operon, absent an antibiotic resistance gene. An operon was designed, composed of an E. coli codon-optimized Z. mobilis pdc, adhA and adhB gene (indicated as pdcEco-adhAEco-adhBEco). Codon-optimization (indicated as Eco) resulted in a change in only the nucleotide sequences compared to the native Z. mobilis genes but encodes identical amino acid sequences. A second alcohol dehydrogenase gene, adhA was added to the construct to improve conversion of acetaldehyde to ethanol. In addition, an E. coli codon-optimized gene for a green fluorescent protein (gfpEco) was added to the end of the operon to serve as a reporter for gene expression. To integrate the newly constructed pdcEco-adhAEco-adhBEco-gfpEco alcohol operon into the chromosome of SD3, sequences of the 23S ribosomal gene (rrl) were chosen to provide homologous sequences flanking the operon. This location was chosen as a site for integration of the alcohol operon because of its documented, high transcription rate (Gourse, R. L. et al., 1996), making it a desirable location to drive the expression of the alcohol genes. A DNA fragment containing the alcohol operon flanked by sequences of the 23S ribosomal gene was cloned into pMEV (see FIG. 18). As there are seven copies of nearly identical sequence of the 23S ribosomal gene in the E. coli genome (rrlA, rrlB, rrlC, rrlD, rrlE, rrlG, and rrlH), the site of initial integration can take place in any one of them. After the first step of integration of the pMEV1-pdcEco-adhAEco-adhBEco-gfpEco plasmid, kanamycin-resistant colonies were selected and assayed for fluorescence due to the expression of the gfp gene. The highest expressing clones were then tested for the ability to ferment xylose to ethanol (xylose was used as substrate because this strain is designed for fermenting pentose sugars from biomass hydrolysate), and the best-performing strain was selected. After selecting the second recombination event by obtaining sucrose-resistant colonies, the complete integration of the new alcohol operon was verified by PCR analysis and nucleotide sequencing. See FIG. 19 for a schematic of the strategy used to introduce the alcohol operon. Sequencing of the region adjacent to the integrated operon showed that the 23S ribosomal gene rrlH was the site of integration (see FIG. 20 for a diagram of the integration location). The resultant strain is SD4. Deletion of the Wφ Phage Capsid Protein Gene, gpN E. coli strain W has been described in the literature as containing a lysogenic phage, Wφ, integrated into its chromosome and capable of producing and releasing phage at a low level (103-104 pfu/ml of culture supernatant) that produce plaques on a E. coli C indicator strain (Pizer, L. I. et al., 1968). To eliminate the ability of SD4 to produce phage particles that could affect process conditions, a strategy was adopted to eliminate the expression of the major capsid protein by deletion of the encoding gene, gpN. This modification also resulted in a strain that is immune to further infection by Wφ or related phages due to its retention of phage-encoded immunity genes, (i.e. C1). A fragment of DNA with sequences flanking the open reading frame of gpN was designed from the Wφ sequence, constructed by PCR and cloned into pMEV. This resultant plasmid was used to construct the gpN deletion in SD4 (see FIG. 21). The deletion was confirmed by PCR and nucleotide sequencing. The resultant strain is E. coli SD5. The strain was tested for its ability to produce phage on the indicator strain E. coli C and was found to be unable to produce detectable infectious particles. In addition, E. coli SD5 was tested based on its known immunity to superinfection with phage produced from E. coli W and was found to be resistant, with no plaque formation seen. Insertion of the Klebsiella oxytoca Urease Operon. To enable E. coli SD7 to use urea as an alternative nitrogen source to ammonia or complex nitrogen-containing compounds, the urease operon from Klebsiella oxytoca M5A1 was introduced into the chromosome. Urease (urea amidohydrolase, EC3.5.1.5) converts urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide (Mobley and Hausinger, 1989—a review of microbial ureases). The ammonia can then be assimilated through regular nitrogen assimilation pathways. While E. coli W does not normally contain this enzyme, many aquatic and soil microorganisms do express ureases, including Klebsiella oxytoca M5A1. In one study, urease was found to be expressed by between 17-30% of the cultivated bacteria (Lloyd and Sheaffe, 1973). The urease operon of Klebsiella was first described in a relative of K. oxytoca, Klebsiella aerogenes, and consists of seven genes, ureDABCEFG, in a contiguous fragment or operon. The same organization and a high degree of homology at both the nucleotide and protein level (ureD, 78%; UreD, 78%; ureA, 91%; UreA, 97%; ureB, 82%; UreB, 88%; ureC, 85%; UreC, 94%; ureE, 81%; UreE, 87%; ureF, 83%; UreF, 86%; ureG, 87%; UreG; 94%) are seen in K. oxytoca M5A1. The urease operon-encoded proteins consist of three structural subunits for the enzyme, UreA, -B and -C, while the remaining four proteins, UreD, -E, -F and -G are required for incorporation of the nickel cofactor of the enzyme (Lee et al, 1992). To introduce the K. oxytoca M5A1 urease operon into E. coli SD5, a 5 kb PCR product was generated from K. oxytoca M5A1 chromosomal DNA and ligated into a plasmid consisting of the pMEV vector and flanking E. coli W sequences from the downstream end of the pro VWX operon. This operon is regulated by osmotic conditions (Lucht and Bremer, 2006) and has been found to be able to similarly regulate the express of heterologous genes (Herbst et al, 1994). The constructed plasmid was used to introduce the urease operon into E. coli SD6 (see FIG. 22). The successful introduction was confirmed by PCR and nucleotide sequencing. The resultant strain was E. coli SD6. Deletion of the Methylglyoxal Synthase Gene, mgsA. The utilization of sugars by bacteria is subject to metabolic control mechanisms that insure a proper flux through glycolysis and the prevention of an imbalance in reducing equivalents and high energy phosphate bonds. One documented control mechanism is the methylglyoxal bypass (Russell and Cook, 1995), which serves to reduce intracellular ATP concentrations which result from exposure of bacteria to high sugar concentrations and inability to balance the flux of energy and carbon through anabolic and catabolic metabolism. The effect of the methylglyoxal pathway is to discharge excess ATP resulting in the production of methylglyoxal from dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Methylglyoxal, however, is a reactive aldehyde and can inhibit the growth and reduce survival of the cell if it is not further metabolized (Booth et al, 2003; Grabar et al, 2006). To eliminate the production of methylglyoxal and the resulting non-fermentative metabolic product lactate, the methylgloxal synthase gene, mgsA, was deleted from SD6 using the method described in FIG. 23. A region of the E. coli W genome sequence flanking the mgsA open reading frame was used to design and synthesize a DNA fragment that was then cloned into pMEV. The deletion was introduced and confirmed by PCR analysis and DNA sequencing. The resultant strain is SD7. Example 3 Construction of Ethanologenic Strain Starting from E. Coli W The following prophetic example describes the production of an ethanologenic strain of the invention starting directly with E. coli W. Although the steps are described in a particular order herein, one of ordinary skill in the art understands that the order the steps are preformed does not effect the final strain, and therefore the genetic modification described below can be done in any order. The genetic modifications set forth in this example are schematically represented in FIG. 27. Starting with E. coli W, genetic changes are made to one or more genes from the frdABCD operon resulting in decreased expression of these one or more genes. Genetic modifications are made to the resulting strain to decrease the expression of the ldhA gene. The phN gene is optionally modified to decrease the expression of this gene. Genes are added to the resulting bacterium to increase the production of ethanol. pdc can be added alone, or in combination with adhA and/or adhB. One or more genes from the urease operon are added. At least ureA, B and C are added to the bacterium. Optionally, ureD, E and/or F are added to the bacterium. The last genetic modification that will be made to the bacterium will a modification to decrease the expression of the msgA gene. The modifications described above will produce an E. coli strain that is ethanol+++ lactate−, succinate−, Wf−, Gfp+, urease+, MgsA−. It is understood by those of skill in the art that modification that decrease expression of a gene can be complete gene deletion, partial gene deletions, frameshift modification, etc. that result in decreased expression of the target gene. Example 4 Ethanol Production by E. coli SD7 This example provides data on the ethanol production by Escherichia coli SD7. The example also provides methods for the production of fermentation broth, analyzing organic acid levels, and for studying heat and chemical inactivation procedures for E. coli SD7. Materials and Methods Two 1.9 L BioFlo fermentation runs of E. coli SD7 were conducted. The broth was subsequently recovered for further testing. Time point was taken at pre-inoculation, post-inoculation, 4, 19.1, 24, 28, 43.4, and 48 hours. The fermentation process is initiated when a vial of frozen glycerol working cell-bank suspension of the bacteria is thawed and approximately 100 μL is inoculated into one seed I flask, consisting of 100 mL of medium in a 250 mL flask. The seed I flask is incubated on a controlled-temperature (35° C.) shaker shaking at 120 rpm for exactly 11 hours. The seed I flask is then used to inoculate a 400 mL seed culture (as seed culture for 1.9 L production fermentations). For the seed II flask, 0.4 mL from the seed I flask stage is aseptically used to inoculate 400 mL of medium in a 1 L seed II flask. The seed flask is incubated on a controlled-temperature (35° C.) shaker shaking at 120 rpm for exactly 8 hours, and production fermentor is inoculated. The main fermentation consists of the initial batch fermentation medium containing AM6 medium, defoamer, and over-limed hydrolysate and the added seed inocula (95 mL). Upon reaching 3.9 hours, the fed-batch model is initiated by setting the feed rate of over-limed spiked hydrolysate feed solution to 2.12 mL/min and AM6 feed to 0.029 mL/min. Agitation cascade limits are set to 200-1000 RPM. Aeration is constant at 60 mL/min. Dissolved oxygen concentration is maintained at 30% by increasing the agitation as the DO drops below the set point of 30%. As DO concentration rises above the set point of 30%, agitation decreases to reduce the DO available in the bulk liquid. Over time the oscillations decrease and DO concentration is maintained at 30%. Integral gain in our NBS system is 0.15 and proportional gain is set to 0.05 (these control the rate at which the agitation changes to the DO concentration). After termination at 48 hrs, culture broth was harvested for genetic identity and inactivation studies. Results and Conclusions FIGS. 24-26 show the time course profiles for the major reactants and products for the E. coli SD7 fed-batch fermentation. During the course of the fermentation, the organism uptakes xylose, arabinose, and glucose and metabolizes them into biomass, ethanol, and organic acids. Some organic acids are present in the initial media and the feed bottle. These organic acids may result in an increase in the concentration (when the feed bottle has a higher concentration than the initial media) or in a decrease in concentration (when the feed bottle has a lower concentration than the initial media). The ethanol and sugar data show that the organisms consumed sugars and produced ethanol.
