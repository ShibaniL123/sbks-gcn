Fifth Step: Synthesis of Compound 2
4.0 g (7.67 mol) of Intermediate 4, 2.47 g (7.67 mol) of Intermediate 5, 2.65 g (19.18 mol) of potassium carbonate, and 0.27 g (0.23 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (0) were added to 30 mL of 1,4-dioxane and 15 mL of water in a 100 mL flask, and the mixture was heated under a nitrogen flow for 12 hours at 80Â° C. When a reaction was complete, a mixture obtained by removing an organic layer therefrom was added to 100 mL of methanol, and a solid crystallized therein was filtered, dissolved in toluene, filtered with silica gel/Celite, and after removing an appropriate amount of an organic solvent, recrystallized with methanol to obtain Compound 2 (3.57 g, a yield of 73%).
