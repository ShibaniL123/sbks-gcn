Step 22: preparation of sodium and 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate [trans-7-(1H-imidazol-3-ium--2-yl)-9-oxo-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undeca-2(6),4-dien-10-yl]sulfate (Example 6)
Sodium {trans-9-oxo-7-[1-(2-trimethylsilylethoxymethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undeca-2(6),4-dien-10-yl}sulfate (6u) (0.01 g, 0.020 mmol) was dissolved in TFA (0.5 mL, 6.53 mmol) at 0°C under inert atmosphere. After stirring for 2 h at rt, the mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was triturated several times in Et2O and the filtrate was filtered on a PTFE filter. The solid was solubilized with water MilliQ®. The aqueous layer was freezed and lyophilized to give sodium and 2,2,2-trifluoroacetate [trans-7-(1H-imidazol-3-ium--2-yl)-9-oxo-3-thia-5,8,10-triaza-tricyclo[6.2.1.02,6]undeca-2(6),4-dien-10-yl]sulfate (Example 6) (0.06 g, 0.012 mmol, 62%) as a white solid.
