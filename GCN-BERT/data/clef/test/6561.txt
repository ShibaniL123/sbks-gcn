Example Compound 61
2-((3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)amino)-2-oxoethyl 2-(2,5-dichlorothiophen-3-yl)acetate
The substance (2,5-dichloro-3-thienyl)acetic acid from step 1 (59.9 mg, 0.3 mmol, see Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2010, vol. 20, page 2809) was dissolved in DCM (5 mL), and added DCC (60.0 mg, 0.3 mmol) and DMAP (6.9 mg, 0.06 mmol) followed by N-(3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1 H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyacetamide (69.3 mg, 0.3 mmol), synthesized as reported in Example 1. The obtained suspension was filtered over cotton to remove the bulk of DCU and purified by column chromatography (75% EtOAc in PE) to yield 106.7 mg of the title compound (86%).
