A regulating device of drawer panel Field of technology This utility model is involved in the field of furniture accessories, exactly a regulating device of drawer panel. Background technology The existing drawer with sliding rail usually adopts the sliding mechanism with internal and external fixation. However, this mechanism has significant technical defects. First of all, the requirements of machining precision and installation accuracy for the sliding mechanism with internal and external fixation are very high. If the dimensional deviation or installation error occurs during install the sliding rail, it will directly result in moving the drawer panel and failing to close; secondly, for the safety of internal and external rail sliding, they are overall integration. However, it is necessary to separate the internal and external rails when clean up the drawer or the sliding rail. The disassembling operation is so messy that how to deal with the slide mechanism with sliding drawer is always the technical problem of product. Chinese patent (patent number: 200620066129.3) discloses a drawer rail assembly that uses the adjusting screw to adjust the vertical position of panel to complete the tripping mechanism through pulling first and then lifting during dismounting. However, this drawer rail assembly only can adjust the up-down position of panel, not the left-right position. Beside, the users often have the lifting action when pull out the drawer, which will make the panel of drawer rail assembly come off easily when pull out the drawer. Therefore, it is necessary to improve further.

Specific implementation ways The next section will further describe this utility model by combining with the following figures. As shown in Figure 1~5, this utility model is a regulating device of drawer panel, including Lshaped stationary frame 2 installed in the drawer side 13, assembled on adjusting bracket 1 of stationary frame 2 through fastening screw 21. The drawer panel 12 is connected with adjusting bracket 2 by horizontal regulating components 3. The longitudinal regulating components 4, matching with the horizontal regulating components 3, are set on the adjusting bracket 1. There also have the elastic tripping components 5 on the adjusting bracket 1. The horizontal regulating components 3 include the jointer with flanges 31 at the end of adjusting bracket and the adjusting screw 32 at the side of the jointer 31. The end of adjusting screw 32 is through the jointer 31 to press on the wall of the adjusting bracket 1. The adjusting screw 32 can rotate about jointer 31 and adjust the horizontal position of jointer 31 by pressing on the end of the wall of adjusting bracket 1. It's important to note that the fixed orifice 33 is set on the jointer 31 to make it fix on the drawer panel 12. The longitudinal regulating components 4 include the distance piece 41 and adjusting rivet 42 on the adjusting bracket 1 respectively. The adjusting rivet 42 is located in the front of the distance piece 41. The flexible connection of distance piece 41 can be realized by the rivet 43 of distance piece and adjusting bracket 1, which complete the rotation and regulation functions of distance piece 41; the adjusting rivet 42 is off-center rivet, rotatably installed on the adjusting bracket 1. It can control the distance piece 41 to make vertical shifting of jointer 31 by rotating the adjusting rivet 42. The elastic tripping components 5 include the guide bar 51 between distance piece 41 and adjusting bracket 1, the spring 52 installed on the guide bar 51 as well. The guide bar 51 is connected with adjusting bracket 1. Besides, one side of spring 52 presses on the end of guide bar 51 while the other side presses on the adjusting bracket 1. There also has the spring cup 53 aligning with adjusting bracket 1 and distance piece 41 above the spring 52. The front end of spring cup 53 presses on adjusting bracket 1; one side of guide bar 51 is inserted in the adjusting bracket 1 through the front end of spring cup 53 while the back end of spring cup 53 is against distance piece 41. It can adjust the position of guide bar 51 by adjusting the distance piece 41 to achieve the compression and tripping of spring 52 caused by guide bar 51, which is convenient to dismantle sliding rail 15. It's important to note that the seal between adjusting bracket 1 and drawer side 13 is achieved by the surface cover 14 of side plate. As shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7, before the jointer 31 is inserted into the adjusting bracket 1, the assembly angle between spring 52 on adjusting bracket 1 and level surface is α; After the jointer 31 is inserted into the adjusting bracket 1, the distance piece 41 is forced to adjust the position of guide bar 51 and will make the spring 52 swing to a certain angle. At the moment, the assembly angle between spring 52 on adjusting bracket 1 and level surface is β. As shown in Figure 8, after the jointer 31 is inserted into the adjusting bracket 1, the jointer 31 with flange 311 exposes the distance piece 41. When side A of flange 311 continues to knock side Β of distance piece 41, it will touch the distance piece 41 at last. As shown in Figure 9, the distance piece 41 is forced to swing inward, side C of the distance piece hooks side D of flange 311. It will pull the jointer 31 to move inward. On the contrary, when the jointer exits, the product action will be against the principles of movement that side Β of distance piece will push side A of flange. For the technical staffs in this field, they can make various corresponding modification and transformation on the basis of the above-described technical proposals and designs. All these modification and transformation will be within the scope of the protection required by this utility model. 1.
