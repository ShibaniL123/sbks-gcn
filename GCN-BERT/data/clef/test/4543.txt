BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Liposomes have been widely used as an in vivo carrier of various therapeutic agents. Ideally, such liposomes should have a high encapsulating efficiency and an extended retention profile (i.e. minimal release of the drug before reaching the targeted site). [0004] NanoVNB® product is a liposomal vinorelbine, which utilizes liposome to enhance the retention of vinorelbine before it reaches the targeted site. Phase I clinical trial of NanoVNB® product did show enhanced anti-cancer efficacy, but the extended retention of vinorelbine in vivo also lead to increased toxicity. [0005] Therefore, there is a need to provide a liposomal composition that is useful for delivery of a therapeutic agent with an adjustable retention profile, to obtain a balance between optimal anti-cancer efficacy and minimal side effect. The present invention addresses this need, as well as other important needs.

[0073] The following examples further illustrate the present invention. These examples are intended merely to be illustrative of the present invention and are not to be construed as being limiting. [0074] Example 1: Preparation of Liposomes [0075] The liposomes were prepared by the solvent injection method. The lipids, including DSPC, DSPE-PEG2000 and cholesterol, were combined at a molar ratio of 3:0.045:2 and dissolved in 99.9% ethanol at about 60°C in a flask. A tabletop ultrasonic bath was used for lipid dissolution. [0076] The dissolved lipid solution was added to the 1.0 mM sodium phosphate solution at lOOmL/min by a peristaltic pump and the two solutions were mixed. The lipid mixture was then passed 6-10 times through a polycarbonate membrane with a pore size of 0.2mm and 0.1 am, respectively. Liposomes (or large multilamellar vesicles) were formed and the average vesicle diameter was about 100-120 nm (measured by Malvern ZetaSizer Nano ZS-90). [0077] The liposome mixture was dialyzed and concentrated by a tangential flow fdtration system against by 0.9% (w/w) sodium chloride and 9% (w/w) sucrose solution with Millipore Pellicon 2 Mini Ultrafdtration Module Biomax-lOOC (0.1m2), and then sterilized using a 0.2 wm sterile fdter. [0078] Example 2: Effect of Monovalent Counterion Donor on the Encapsulation Efficiency and Retention Profile [0079] The pharmaceutical composition was prepared by mixing the liposomes in Example 1 with ammonium sulfate, a monovalent counterion donor. A gradient across the lipid bilayer membrane of the liposome was established using 300 mM and 600 mM of ammonium sulfate, for remote loading of vinorelbine. The encapsulating (loading) efficiency and the retention profile of liposomal vinorelbine was assessed using in vitro plasma release method and the results are summarized in Table 1. [0080] Results: The data shows ammonium sulfate was effective in loading or encapsulating vinorelbine in the liposome. However, ammonium sulfate was less effective in retaining vinorelbine in the liposome, with less than 30% of vinorelbine remain encapsulated in the liposome after 24 hours of plasma incubation.

Two pharmaceutical compositions were prepared by mixing the liposomes in Example 1 with 4mM and 8 mM of ammonium dextran sulfate respectively, followed by the remote loading of about 2mg of Vinorelbine, incubated at about 60 °C. [0084] The encapsulating efficiency and the retention profile of liposomal vinorelbine in these two pharmaceutical compositions were assessed using in vitro plasma release method and the results are summarized in Table 2. [0085] Results: 8mM of ammonium dextran sulfate resulted in an encapsulation efficiency of 93%, whereas the encapsulating efficiency for 4 mM of ammonium dextran sulfate was below 90%. Similarly, LV009 formulation in Table 4 included polyvalent counterion donor only and had a less than 90% encapsulation efficiency and a retention rate of 98.74% 24 hours after plasma incubation.

[0089] Liposomes prepared according to Example 1 were mixed with 300mM of ammonium sulfate (monovalent counterion donor) and various concentrations of sodium dextran sulfate (polyvalent counterion donor salt). [0090] The encapsulating efficiency and the retention profile of various liposomal vinorelbines were assessed using 24-hour in vitro plasma release method and the results are summarized in Table 3. [0091] Results: The data demonstrate that the various combinations of mono- and polyvalent counterion donors maintain the encapsulation efficiency of vinorelbine, and the liposome size was around 100 nm. In addition, the retention profile of liposomal vinorelbine depends on the concentration of the polyvalent counterion donor. 8mM of sodium dextran sulfate is associated with a higher percentage of vinorelbine retention at 24 hours (78.9%) than that of 2mM of sodium dextran sulfate (51.8%).

[0095] Liposomes prepared according to Example 1 were mixed with 300mM of ammonium sulfate (AS) and two different polyvalent counterion donor salts: dextran sulfate (DS) sodium salt and DS ammonium salt. [0096] The encapsulating efficiency and the retention profile of liposomal vinorelbine was assessed using 24-hour in vitro plasma release method and the results are summarized in Table 4. [0097] Results: The data shows that sodium salt and ammonium salt of dextran sulfate were equally effective in retaining vinorelbine in the liposome after 24 hours of plasma incubation. In addition, when the concentration of polyvalent counterion donor or its salt is at 10ΐτΐΜ. the retention profile of the mono- and polyvalent counterion donor combination (100% and 94.2% of vinorelbine remaining in the liposome at 24 hours) was similar to that of polyvalent counterion donor composition (98.7% of vinorelbine remaining in the liposome after 24 hours). This is in contrast with the data in Table 3, wherein when the concentration of the polyvalent counterion donor was less than lOmM, the retention profile of liposomal vinorelbine depends on the concentration of the polyvalent counterion donor.

Liposomes prepared according to Example 1 were mixed with ammonium sulfate and 5Κ and 8Κ of dextran sulfate, respectively. [00101] The encapsulating efficiency and the retention profile of liposomal vinorelbines were assessed using 24-hour in vitro plasma release method and the results are summarized in Table 5. [00102] Results: The total valency of the polyvalent counterion donor affects the retention profile of liposomal vinorelbine. The data indicates that polyvalent counterion donor with higher valency is associated with more encapsulated vinorelbine at 24 hours. [00103] Table 5.

The encapsulation efficiency and the retention profde of liposomal vinorelbine were assessed using 24-hour in vitro plasma release method and summarized in Tables 6-8. [00106] Results of Table 6: At 72 hours, 72.2 % of encapsulated vinorelbine still remained in NanoVNB composition (a pharmaceutical composition comprises polyvalent counterion donor octasulfate triethylamine only) and this high retention rate at 72 hours can lead to toxicity, most notably skin toxicity. On the other hand, all of the encapsulated vinorelbine was released in LV005 composition (a pharmaceutical composition comprises monovalent counterion donor only) at 72 hours, and this is associated with low therapeutic efficacy. By combining mono- and polyvalent counterion donors, a range of liposomal vinorelbine retention profile was obtained. It is noted the total equivalent of valency of the polyvalent counterion donor or its pharmaceutically acceptable salt is about 1 to about 240 mEq. [00107] Table 6.

[00112] Example 8: In Vivo Anti-Cancer Evaluation Using HT-29 Human Colon Cancer Cells [00113] An in vivo anti-cancer evaluation of the LV304 pharmaceutical composition was performed using an orthotopic HT-29 human colon tumor model in mice. [00114] Mice had free access to drinking water and food at all time during this trial. [00115] The study design involved 3 study groups as follows: [00116] NanoNVB Group: 6 mice were given 25mg/kg of vinorelbine as NanoVNB, once daily by intravenous injection on day 0, 3, 6 and 9. [00117] LV304 Group: 6 mice were given 25mg/kg of vinorelbine as LV304 pharmaceutical composition, once daily by intravenous injection on day 0, 3, 6 and 9. [00118] Control Group: 6 mice were given a once daily intravenous saline injection on day 0, 3, 6 and 9. [00119] During the study period, the following outcomes were measured: ■ Percentage of tumor growth change (% T/C). This was calculated by the following formula: (Tumor weight dByx - Tumor weight <jay oWedTTumor weight dayx - Tumor weight dayo)controi x 100%. ■ Maximum body weight change, compare to the body weight on Day 0. ■ Mean tumor doubling time (TDT). This is widely used for quantification of tumor growth rate and is calculated by the following formula: (day χ - day 0) day χ was the time taken for the tumor volume to double compared with the staging size. Skin Toxicity Score, assessed and graded based on the parameters listed in Table 7. [00120] Table 7. Skin Toxicity Score Grade Signs & Severity Hair loss & edema around the eyelid Hair loss around the groin 0 None None 1 Slight Slight 2 Moderate Moderate 3 Severe Severe 4 Very severe Very severe [00121] Result: [00122] Table 8 shows the percentage of tumor growth change (% T/C) on day 8 was similar between NanoVNB and LV304 groups (-41.0% for NanoVNB and -42.4% LV304). The mean tumor doubling time (Mean TDT) was > 78 days in the NanoVNB group, 67.1 days in LV304 group and 7.6 days in the control group. In addition, mice received LV304 displayed less side effects (less weight loss and lower skin toxicity score) relative to mice received NanoVNB. [00123] FIGURE 2 shows the mean tumor volume in the NanoVNB group, the LV304 group and the saline (control) group. The results indicate that the mean tumor volume in the NanoVNB and LV 304 groups were lower than 200 mm3 throughout the study period, whereas the mean tumor volume in the control group exceeded 3000 mm3 at day 40. [00124] These results indicate that LV304 is an effective anti-cancer therapeutic agent relative to NanoVNB, but displayed less side effects. [00125] Table 8.

[00127] The study design involved 3 study groups as follows: [00128] NanoNVB Group: 6 mice were given 50% of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of NanoVNB (1/2 MTD=7.5mg/kg of vinorelbine) as a single intravenous injection on day 0. [00129] LV304 Group: 6 mice were given 50% of the MTD of LV304 pharmaceutical composition (1/2 MTD= lOmg/kg of vinorelbine) as a single intravenous injection on day 0. [00130] Control Group: 6 mice were given a single saline intravenous injection on day 0. [00131] During the study period, the following outcomes were measured: ■ Maximum body weight change, compare to the body weight on Day 0. ■ Mean survival time. [00132] Results: Referring to Table 9, the mean survival time for mice was 33.8 days after a single NanoVNB injection, 34.2 days after a single LV304 injection and 21.4 days after a single saline injection. FIGURE 3 shows the survival time in NanoVNB group and LV304 group were significant longer from the saline (control) group (ρ < 0.01). [00133] Table 9.

Mice had free access to drinking water and food at all time during this trial and were randomized into 3 study groups as follows: [00136] NanoVNB Group: 6 mice received 7.5 mg/kg of vinorelbine as NanoVNB, through a daily IV injection on Day 0 and 9, 5 mg/kg on Day 3 and 6. [00137] LV304 Group: 6 mice received 7.5mg/kg of vinorelbine as LV304, through a daily IV injection on Day 0 and 9, 5mg/kg on Day 3 and 6. [00138] Control Group: 6 mice received once daily IV saline injection on Day 0, 3, 6 and 9. [00139] During the study period, the skin toxicity was assessed and scored based on the grading system in Table 7. [00140] Results: FIGURE 4 shows the skin toxicity scores in the NanoVNB group and the LV304 group. The skin toxicity in the LV304 group was significantly less compare to the NanoVNB group during the 60 day trial period.
