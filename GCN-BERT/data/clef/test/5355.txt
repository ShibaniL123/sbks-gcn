Step B: 8-Chloro-7-(difluoromethyl)-2-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
To a solution of 8-chloro-2-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-7-carbaldehyde (171 mg, 0.47 mmol) in DCM (10.9 mL) at 0° C. under an N2 atmosphere was added diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (0.22 mL, 1.64 mmol) dropwise via syringe. The mixture was allowed to warm to rt and stirred overnight, before pouring over ice (ca. 25 mL). Sat. aq. NaHCO3 (30 mL) was then added, the mixture stirred vigorously for 5 minutes, and EtOAc (30 mL) added. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (×2), and the combined organics washed with brine, dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated. The residue was purified (FCC, SiO2, 0-100% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford the title compound as a white solid (117 mg, 87% yield).
