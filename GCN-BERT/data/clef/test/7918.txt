THERAPEUTIC METHOD FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates generally to a method of down-regulating an inflammatory response in a mammal and to agents useful for same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method of down-regulating an inflammatory response in the reproductive tract or external genital tissue of a female mammal by contacting the mucosal tissue of the reproductive tract and/or genitalia with lactic acid and to agents useful for same. The method of the present invention is useful, inter alia, in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of conditions characterised by an aberrant, unwanted or otherwise inappropriate inflammatory response including, for example, atrophic vaginitis, irritant vaginitis or infectious vaginitis. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION The reference in this specification to any prior publication (or information derived from it), or to any matter which is known, is not, and should not be taken as an acknowledgment or admission or any form of suggestion that that prior publication (or information derived from it) or known matter forms part of the common general knowledge in the field of endeavour to which this specification relates. Bibliographic details of the publications referred to by author in this specification are collected alphabetically at the end of the description. Mammals are required to defend themselves against a multitude of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites, as well as non-pathogenic insults such as tumours and toxic, or otherwise harmful, agents. In response, effector mechanisms have evolved which are capable of mounting a defence against such antigens. These mechanisms are mediated by soluble molecules and/or by cells. In the context of these effector mechanisms, inflammation is a complex multifaceted process in response to disease or injury and which is regulated by the release of a series of cytokines (Alexander et al, 2001, J Endotoxin Res 7:167-202). These cytokines are classified in general terms as pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines and the critical balance between release and activity of cytokines with opposing actions regulates the inflammatory response to prevent it from becoming overt or understated. If the inflammatory response continues unchecked and is overt then the host may suffer associated tissue damage and in severe cases this may present as septic shock and multiorgan failure can occur (Ulevitch et al., 1999, Curr Opin Immunol 11:19-22). Conversely, a poor or understated inflammatory response may mean uncontrolled infection resulting in chronic illness and host damage. Regulation of the inflammatory response is important at both the systemic level and the local level. The discovery of the detailed processes of inflammation has revealed a close relationship between inflammation and the immune response. There are five basic indicators of inflammation, these being redness (rubor), swelling (tumour), heat (calor), pain (dolor) and deranged function (functio laesa). These indicators occur due to extravasation of plasma and infiltration of leukocytes into the site of inflammation. Consistent with these indicators, the main characteristics of the inflammatory response are therefore: (i) vasodilation - widening of the blood vessels to increase the blood flow to the infected area; (ii) increased vascular permeability - this allows diffusible components to enter the site; (iii) cellular infiltration - this being the directed movement of inflammatory cells through the walls of blood vessels into the site of injury; (iv) changes in biosynthetic, metabolic and catabolic profiles of many organs; and (ν) activation of cells of the immune system as well as of complex enzymatic systems of blood plasma. The degree to which these characteristics occur is generally proportional to the severity of the injury and/or the extent of infection. In the context of the unique microenvironment of the human female reproductive tract, the mucosal epithelium of the reproductive tract acts as a physical barrier and expresses immunological mediators that serve as the first line of attack against infection (Hickey et al, 2011, JReprod Immunol 88:185-194; Kaushic, C. 2011, Am JReprod Immunol 65:253-260. The vagina and ectocervix comprise multiple layers of usually ηοηkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium, with the uppermost permeable stratum corneum layer lacking tight junctions (Blaskewicz, et al. 2011, Biol Reprod 85:97-104), and are in contact with vaginal microbiota and semen. The cervical transformation zone separating the endocervix and ectocervix is the most immunologically active site in the reproductive tract with a relative abundance of lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells (Pudney, et al. 2005. Biol Reprod 73:1253-1263). Additionally, the vagina/ectocervix and endocervix exhibit immunological functions by conferring tolerance to microbes, maintaining epithelial integrity and recruiting and supporting of immune cells (Fichorova, R. Ν., and D. J. Anderson. 1999. Biol Reprod 60:508-514). As the front line of the innate immune response, reproductive tract epithelial cells express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Kaushic, C. 2011. Supra; Wira, et al. 2005. Am J Reprod Immunol 53:65-76). They respond to pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via their TLRs by secreting cytokines and chemokines, antimicrobial peptides (defensins and secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor; SLPI), antimicrobial enzymes (lactoferrin and lysozome), surfactant protein A and complement (Fichorova, R. Ν., and D. J. Anderson. 1999. Supra; Hickey, et al. 2011, Supra; Kaushic, C. 2011, Supra). Nevertheless, disruption in the equilibrium of the reproductive tract, leading to the onset of inflammation is experienced by many women. The consequences of disturbances in this microenvironment range from annoying irritation through to an increased susceptibility to serious infections, such as HIV. To this end, three of the main causes of vaginal inflammation are: (i) Atrophic vaginitis - This is most likely to be the result of having had a hysterectomy or occurs in a post menopausal woman. Atrophic vaginitis is estimated to affect as many as 40% of women. This type of inflammation is brought about due to the lack of estrogen stimulation of the vaginal tissue which can lead to the formation of adhesions, painful intercourse and an increased susceptibility to infections, itching burning, stinging and a watery discharge. (ii) Irritant vaginitis - Irritant vaginitis is caused by an irritant. For example, sensitivity to a chemical being used or an allergic reaction to something one has come into contact with. This can be caused by a number of chemicals or physical agents, including tampons, the chemicals in scented feminine hygiene products, of personal lubricant, or even the harshness of the chemicals in the detergent being used to wash ones undergarments. (iii) Infectious vaginitis - Infectious vaginitis is any type of vaginitis caused by microorganism infection - fungal, bacterial, viral, parasitic or otherwise. These include gardeneralla (a bacterial infection), any type of vims, STDs (like chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis), and vaginal yeast infection. Although Lactobacillus sp dominate the microbiota of the healthy female reproductive tract and produce lactic acid (both L and D isoforms) to a concentration of approximately 1% which acidifies the reproductive tract to pH <4, the role, if any, of Lactobacillus sp., amongst the many other flora present in the reproductive tract, in terms of contributing to the health of the reproductive tract, has not been understood. That is, the vaginal microbiome is complex. In fact, whereas Lactobacillus sp. have been shown to be associated with anti-inflammatory activity in the gut, the studies of Mossop et al (2011, Obstet. Gynecol. 118:840-6) demonstrated that with human female reproductive tissue, lactic acid, this being the major metabolite produced by Lactobacillus sp., is pro-inflammatory at low pH. This finding is not unexpected when one considers that the human female reproductive tract is a unique microenvironment. Specifically, the vagina is a highly acidic environment, more so than other organs or tissue. In fact, the human female reproductive tract is significantly more acidic than even the reproductive tracts of other non-human primates. Still further, it is known that carboxylic acids, such as acetic acid, and short chain fatty acids produced by bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria are pro-inflammatory (Mirmonsef et al 2012, Am J Rep Immunol 67: 391). Again, this contrasts to the situation in the gut where the same carboxylic acids and short chain fatty acids are shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects. Although lactic acid is included in the formulations of a range of vaginal gels which are currently on the market, in some of these gels it is included merely as an excipient. That is, as a largely inactive substance used as a vehicle for the active ingredient in the gel, this usually being a microbicide. In fact, the lactic acid in these formulations is used at a concentration significantly higher than the physiological concentrations present in the human vagina. Nevertheless, lactic acid is known to conveniently function as a preservative. Still further, since it is a naturally acid molecule, in some gels, although not used strictly as an excipient, it is included for its role in acid buffering in the presence of semen to kill sperm. In fact, Acidform, an acid-buffering product, which inactivates spermatozoa, is formulated with 2% lactic acid and other acids such as citric, benzoic and alginic acid. Interestingly, a Phase I Randomized Safety Study investigating Acidform as a ηοηhormonal topical contraceptive demonstrated an increase in irritation in treated subjects, as well as a decrease in anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1RA (Keller et al 2012, Plos ONE 7:℮46901). Similarly, this ability to reduce pH and thereby maintain a pH conducive to microbicidal activity is a useful adjunct to the major active components present in these gels. In work leading up to the present invention, it has been surprisingly determined that although carboxylic acids have been shown to be anti-inflammatory in the gut and pro-inflammatory in the human reproductive tract, lactic acid functions entirely contrarily. Specifically, it has been unexpectedly found that within the human female reproductive tract, lactic acid exerts anti-inflammatory activity. Still further, it has also been determined that, in fact, carboxylic acids such as acetic acid and citric acid (which are often formulated together with lactic acid in vaginal gels), could actually antagonise the activity of lactic acid. Still further, this anti-inflammatory activity does not require the lactic acid to be used at high concentrations. Rather, use of lactic acid at physiological concentrations is anti-inflammatory. The findings of the present invention have now facilitated the development of methods and agents directed to down-regulating inflammation in the female reproductive tract by administering lactic acid to the mucosal surface of the reproductive tract. Accordingly, there are now provided methods for both the therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of unwanted or inappropriate inflammatory responses of the female reproductive tract.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is predicated, in part, on the unexpected determination that lactic acid functions as an anti-inflammatory agent within the female reproductive tract. Specifically, whereas carboxylic acids, generally, have been found to function as antiinflammatories in the gut, they function in a pro-inflammatory manner in the unique microenvironment of the reproductive tract. Lactic acid, however, although having been shown by Mossop et al to be pro-inflammatory in the reproductive tract, has now been determined to function in an anti-inflammatory manner in the female reproductive tract. Still further, the functional activity of lactic acid is, in fact, antagonised by other carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, tartaric acid and alginic acid. Accordingly, the physiological and immunological functioning of lactic acid in the context of the reproductive tract is counter-intuitive, particularly when considered in light of the fact that even concentrations of lactic acid much higher than physiological levels have been assumed to be either relatively inert when administered to the female reproductive tract or to do no more than provide pH buffering or acidification effects. Lactic acid has therefore been regularly used as an excipient in vaginal gels. In fact, may be likely that the lack of any significant functionality of lactic acid in this context is due to the antagonistic activity of other carboxylic acids, present in these formulations, on lactic acid. Accordingly, these findings have now facilitated the rational design of means for down-regulating an inflammatory response in the female reproductive tract and genital tissue. There is therefore also now provided a means for therapeutically or prophylactically treating conditions, such as vaginitis, which are characterised by inflammation. Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention is directed to a method for down-regulating inflammation in the reproductive tract or genital tissue of a female mammal said method comprising the mucosal administration of a composition comprising an organic acid having the formula (I) or in vivo hydrolysable esters or phosphate esters and salts thereof: wherein η is an integer from 1 to 10; wherein Pr is hydrogen or an in vivo hydrolysable protecting group; and wherein the compound is in the form of a racemate, enantiomer or a mixture of enantiomers and wherein said mucosa is contacted with an effective concentration of approximately 0.1% - 1.9% ν/ν of said organic acid. The term “mammal” as used herein includes humans, primates, livestock animals (eg. horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, donkeys), laboratory test animals (eg. mice, rats, guinea pigs), companion animals (eg. dogs, cats) and captive wild animals (eg. kangaroos, deer, foxes). As detailed hereinbefore, the female reproductive tract of human females is particularly unusual since it is a significantly more acidic microenvironment than the female reproductive tract of other non-human primates. The exceptional and unique physiology of the human female reproductive tract is consistent with the fact that most carboxylic acids have been found to exhibit pro-inflammatory activity in the human reproductive tract despite exhibiting anti-inflammatory activity in other tissue microenvironments, such as the gut. In the context of lactic acid, however, which is also a carboxylic acid, it has been determined that it exhibit anti-inflammatory activity in the reproductive tract. Accordingly, in one embodiment, said mammal is a human. According to this embodiment there is provided a method of down-regulating inflammation in the reproductive tract or genital tissue of a female human said method comprising the mucosal administration of a composition comprising an organic acid having the formula (I) or in vivo hydrolysable esters or phosphate esters and salts thereof: wherein η is an integer from 0 to 10; wherein Pr is hydrogen or an in vivo hydrolysable protecting group; and wherein the compound is in the form of a racemate, enantiomer or a mixture of enantiomers and wherein said mucosa is contacted with an effective concentration of approximately 0.1% - 1.9% ν/ν of said organic acid. Reference to “reproductive tract” of a female mammal should be understood as a reference to the organs and tissues which contribute towards the reproductive process. Without limiting the present invention to any one theory or mode of action, the female reproductive tract comprises three main parts: the vagina, the uterus, and the ovaries. The vagina meets the external environment at the vulva, which also includes the labia, clitoris and urethra. The vagina is attached to the uterus through the cervix, while the uterus is attached to the ovaries via the fallopian tubes. Reference to “reproductive tract” should therefore be understood as a reference to all or part of any one or more of these organs or tissues. Reference to the “genital tissue” should be understood as a reference to all of the external female genitalia including but not limited to the labium majora, labium minora, clitoris, perineum, vulva and urethral orifice. In one embodiment, said reproductive tract is the vagina and said genital tissue is genital mucosa. Without limiting the present invention to any one theory or mode of action the mucous membranes are linings of mostly endodermal origin, covered in epithelium, which are involved in absorption and secretion. They line cavities that are exposed to the external environment and internal organs, in particular the vagina and genitalia. They are at several places contiguous with skin, such as the genital area, and the anus. According to this embodiment there is provided a method of down-regulating inflammation in the vagina or genital mucosa of a female human said method comprising the mucosal administration of a composition comprising and organic acid having the formula (I) or in vivo hydrolysable esters or phosphate esters and salts thereof: wherein η is an integer from 1 to 10; wherein Pr is hydrogen or an in vivo hydrolysable protecting group; and wherein the compound is in the form of a racemate, enantiomer or a mixture of enantiomers and wherein said mucosa is contacted with an effective concentration of approximately 0.1% - 1.9% ν/ν of said organic acid. Still without limiting the present invention to any one theory or mode of action, the inflammatory response is a complex response characterised by a series of physiological and/or immunological events which are induced to occur by the release of a cytokine cascade in response to any one of a variety of stimuli including, but not limited to, tissue injury, infection, an immune response (such as to a pathogen or an innocuous agent - as occurs with allergies) or disease (such as tumour formation or an autoimmune response). The physiological events which characterise inflammation include: (i) vasodilation (ii) increased vascular permeability (iii) cellular infiltration (iv) changes to the biosynthetic, metabolic and catabolic profiles of affected organs (ν) activation of the cells of the immune system. It should be understood that reference to “inflammation” or an "inflammatory response" is a reference to any one or more of the physiological and/or immunological events or phases that are induced to occur in the context of inflammation and, specifically, in response to the signals generated by the cytokine cascade which directs the inflammatory response. For example IL-1, TNFa and IL-6 are well known for their functions as pro-inflammatory mediators. It should also be understood that an inflammatory response within the context of the present invention includes a reference to a partial response, such as a response which has only just commenced, or to any specific phase or event of a response (such as the phases and events detailed in points (i)-(v), above, or any other effect related to inflammation). Further, it should also be understood that depending on any given set of specific circumstances, the end point of an inflammatory response may vary. For example, in some situations there may only occur an acute vascular response. To the extent that "acute" inflammation occurs, this is generally understood to include the events of both an acute vascular response and an acute cellular response. Some inflammatory responses will resolve at the acute stage while others may progress to become chronic cellular responses. In certain circumstances the acute process, characterized by neutrophil infiltration and oedema, gives way to a predominance of mononuclear phagocytes and lymphocytes. This is thought to occur to some degree with the normal healing process but becomes exaggerated and chronic when there is ineffective elimination of foreign materials as in certain infections or following introduction of foreign bodies or deposition of crystals (e.g. urate crystals). Chronic inflammation is often associated with fusion of mononuclear cells to form multinucleated gigant cells, which eventually become a granuloma. Chronic inflammation is also seen under conditions of delayed hypersensitivity. Examples of inflammatory responses include, but are not limited to vaginitis (induced by, for example, irritants, infectious agents such as pathogens, imbalance of commensal bacteria, allergy or hormones), vaginosis tissue injury, diabetes and semen. In another example, the inflammatory response may also be a side effect resulting from a course of treatment directed to an unrelated condition. For example, tenofovir is known to decrease the functionality of some anti-inflammatory mediators. Accordingly, inflammation which is the subject of treatment in accordance with the method of the invention is not limited in terms of how it has been caused. Without limiting the present invention to any one theory or mode of action, vaginitis is an inflammation of the vagina. It can result in discharge, itching and pain, and is often associated with an irritation or infection of the vulva. It is usually caused due to infection. The three main kinds of infectious vaginitis are bacterial vaginosis, vaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. A woman may have any combination of vaginal infections at one time. Infectious vaginitis accounts for 90% of all cases in reproductive age women. Other less common infections are caused by gonorrhea, chlamydia, Mycoplasma, herpes, HIV, Campylobacter, improper hygiene, and some parasites, notably Trichomonas vaginalis. Vaginal infections are often a mix of various etiologies, which can present challenging cases for treatment. Indeed, when only one cause is treated, the other pathogens can gain in resistance and induce relapses and recurrences. Further, either a change in pH balance or introduction of foreign bacteria in the vagina can also lead to infection. To this end, there are physical factors that can contribute to the development of infection, such as a constant wet vulva due to tight clothing, chemicals contacting the vagina via scented tampons, antibiotics, birth control pills/injections, douching, or a diet favouring refined sugar and yeast. Hormonal vaginitis includes atrophic vaginitis usually found in postmenopausal or postpartum women. Sometimes it can occur in young girls before puberty. In these situations the estrogen support of the vagina is poor. Irritant vaginitis can be caused by allergies to condoms, spermicides, soaps, perfumes, douches, lubricants and semen. It can also be caused by hot tubs, abrasion, tissue, tampons or topical medications. Foreign bodies (most commonly retained tampons or condoms) can also cause extremely malodorous vaginal discharges. It should be understood that the inflammation which is treated by the method of the present invention may be the result of any cause. In one embodiment, said inflammation is infectious vaginitis. Without limiting the present invention to any one theory or mode of action lactic acid is a carboxylic acid with the chemical formula CsHgCL. It has a hydroxyl group adjacent to the carboxyl group, making it an alpha hydroxy acid. In solution, it can lose a proton from the carboxyl group, producing the lactate ion CH3CH(OH)COO\ Lactic acid is miscible with water or ethanol, and is hygroscopic. It is chiral and consists of two optical isomers. One is known as L-(+)-lactic acid or (.V)-lactic acid and the other, its mirror image, is D(-)-lactic acid or (7?)-lactic acid. In animals, L-lactate is constantly produced from pyruvate via the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in a process of fermentation during normal metabolism and exercise. However, it is also produced by lactic acid bacteria. The lactic acid bacteria (LAB) comprise a clade of Gram-positive, low-GC, acid-tolerant, generally ηοηsporulating, non-respiring rod or cocci that are associated by their common metabolic and physiological characteristics. These bacteria produce lactic acid as the major metabolic end-produce of carbohydrate fermentation. LAB contribute to the healthy microflora of human mucosal surfaces. The genera that comprise the LAB are at its core Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Lactococcus, and Streptococcus as well as the more peripheral Aerococcus, Carnobacterium, Enterococcus, Oenococcus, Sporolactobacillus, Tetragenococcus, Vagococcus, and Weisella\ these belonging to the order Lactobacillales. The method of the present invention is predicated on the administration to the mucosa of the reproductive tract or the genital tissue of an organic acid having the formula (I) or in vivo hydrolysable esters or phosphate esters and salts thereof: wherein η is an integer from 1 to 10; wherein Pr is hydrogen or an in vivo hydrolysable protecting group; and wherein the compound is in the form of a racemate, enantiomer or a mixture of enantiomers. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” should be understood to refer to salts which retain their biological effectiveness and properties of the disclosed compounds and which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. Suitable salts include those derived from alkali metals such as potassium and sodium, alkaline earth metals such as calcium and magnesium, and ammonium salts. Preferred in vivo hydrolysable esters or phosphate esters are pharmaceutically acceptable ester derivatives convertible by solvolysis under physiological conditions to the parent carboxylic acid, e.g., lower alkyl esters, cycloalkyl esters, lower alkenyl esters, benzyl esters, mono- or di-substituted lower alkyl esters, such as the omega-(amino, mono- or dilower alkylamino, carboxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl)-lower alkyl esters, the alpha-(lower alkanoyloxy, lower alkoxycarbonyl or di- lower alkylaminocarbonyl)-lower alkyl esters, phosphate esters and the like conventionally used in the art. A wide variety of protecting groups suitable for protecting the hydroxyl group I the compound of formula (I) are well-known in the art. For example, the hydroxyl functional group may be protected as a sulfonate, ester or carbonate promoiety, which may be hydrolyzed in vivo to provide the hydroxyl group. In one embodiment of the organic acid of formula (I), η is an integer from 0 to 5. In another embodiment of the organic acid of formula (I), η is 0. In still another embodiment of the organic acid of formula (I), Pr is sulfonate, ester or carbonate. In yet still another embodiment of the organic acid of formula (I), η is 0 and Pr is hydrogen, that is, said acid is lactic acid. Accordingly, in one preferred aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of down-regulating inflammation in the reproductive tract or genital tissue of a human said method comprising the mucosal administration of a composition comprising lactic acid or hydrolysable ester or phosphate ester or salt thereof and wherein said mucosa is contacted with an effective concentration of approximately 0.1% - 1.9% ν/ν of said lactic acid. In another embodiment said reproductive tract is the vagina and said genital tissue is genital mucosa. Reference to “down-regulating” an inflammatory response should be understood as a reference to preventing, reducing (eg. slowing) or otherwise inhibiting one or more aspects of an inflammatory response. The present invention is predicated on the localised delivery of lactic acid to the mucosal tissue of the reproductive tract and/or the genitals. Reference to “mucosal administration” should therefore be understood as a reference to introducing the subject composition to the mammal by any route which will enable it to contact the mucosal immune tissue of the genital or reproductive tract. Typically, this can be achieved by administering the composition via an intravaginal route such as via topically applied compositions or locally administered injections. Although said mucosal administration will generally take the form of administration directly to mucosal tissue, the present invention nevertheless extends to other modes of administration which nevertheless may achieve delivery of lactic acid to the vaginal or genital mucosa. Although it has been determined that lactic acid functions as an anti-inflammatory molecule in the reproductive tract of the human female, in a further aspect it has still further been surprisingly determined that lactic acid anti-inflammatory functionality is antagonised by the presence of other acids, in particular other organic or carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid and alginic acid. Most microbicidal and feminine hygiene products are formulated with both lactic acid as an excipient and other carboxylic acids which function to lower the pH of the vagina. Although lactic acid is not designed to function as an active ingredient in these formulations, it is now known that the fact that it is assumed to be relatively inert (even at the high concentrations at which it is used - > 4% ν/ν), the presence of other carboxylic acids would have nevertheless antagonised the previously unrecognised anti-inflammatory properties of lactic acid, thereby effectively rendering said lactic acid inert and therefore useful to be used as a mere excipient. However, in light of the findings of the present invention, it has now been demonstrated that lactic acid will produce a particularly effective anti-inflammatory response when it is formulated without other carboxylic acids. According to this related aspect there is provided a method of down-regulating inflammation in the reproductive tract or genital tissue of a female mammal said method comprising the mucosal administration of a composition comprising an organic acid having the formula (I) or in vivo hydrolysable esters or phosphate esters and salts thereof: wherein η is an integer from 1 to 10; wherein Pr is hydrogen or an in vivo hydrolysable protecting group; and wherein the compound is in the form of a racemate, enantiomer or a mixture of enantiomers and wherein said mucosa is contacted with an effective concentration of approximately 0.1% - 1.9% ν/ν of said organic acid; and wherein said composition does not comprise carboxylic acids other than the organic acid of formula (I). As detailed hereinbefore it has been determined that the anti-inflammatory properties of lactic acid are functional when lactic acid is used at physiological levels. This finding is unexpected when considered in light of the fact that lactic acid is currently used as an inert excipient at concentrations well above physiological levels. Without limiting the present invention to any one theory or mode of action, lactic acid is generally found in the lower human female reproductive tract at a concentration of approximately 1% ν/ν. To this end, lactic acid has now been determined to exhibit anti-inflammatory functionality when used at a concentration of as low as 0.1% up to about 1.9% ν/ν, preferably 0.2% 1.8%, 0.3% - 1.7%, 0.3% - 1.6%, 0.3% - 1.5%, 0.3% - 1.4%, 0.3% - 1.3%, 0.3% -1.2%, 0.3% - 1.1% or 0.3% - 1% ν/ν. In this regard, reference to the “contacting” the mucosa with an “effective concentration” of approximately 0.1% - 1.9% ν/ν should be understood to mean that the concentrations of the subject organic acid which acts on the vaginal mucosal tissue is at this concentration. It would be appreciated by the person of skill in the art that the concentrations of the organic acid as formulated in the product which is provided to a patient to use may be at a higher concentration. This may be due to the inherent dilution or dissipation loss of active ingredient which occurs subsequently to application of the product but prior to it functionally acting on the mucosa. For example, an oral formulation may have to be formulated at a high concentration to allow for dissipation of the active ingredient as it is processed through the digestive system. In another example, in the context of a topical formulation the concentration of the active ingredient in the gel or cream itself may have to be adjusted to take into account the relative viscosity of the gel or cream and therefore the extent to which it is likely to become diluted by the natural vaginal fluids. That is, it may be necessary to prepare a topical formulation at a higher concentration such that any dilution which may inherently occur subsequently to its application leads to an effective concentration of 0.1% - 1.9% ν/ν being delivered to the mucosal tissue. It is well within the skill of the person in the art to calculate and generate an appropriate formulation. In one embodiment there is provided a method of down-regulating inflammation in the reproductive tract or genital tissue of a female mammal said method comprising the mucosal administration of a composition comprising an organic acid having the formula (I) or in vivo hydrolysable esters or phosphate esters and salts thereof: wherein η is an integer from 1 to 10; wherein Pr is hydrogen or an in vivo hydrolysable protecting group; and wherein the compound is in the form of a racemate, enantiomer or a mixture of enantiomers and wherein said mucosa is contacted with an effective concentration of approximately 0.3% 1.5% ν/ν of said organic acid. In another embodiment said concentration is 0.3% - 1.4%, 0.3% - 1.3%, 0.3% - 1.2%, 0.3% - 1.1% or 0.3% - 1.0% ν/ν. In another embodiment, said concentration is 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%,0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9%, 1.0%, 1.1%, 1.2%, 1.3%, 1.4%, 1.5% ν/ν. It would be understood by the person of skill in the art that reference to the above percentage values are approximate to the extent that some deviation from these specific percentages is acceptable and provides a functionally equivalent proportion. It is well within the skill of the person in the art to determine, based on very simple and routine in vitro or in vivo testing systems, to what extent some deviation from these percentage values is enabled. For example, it is to be expected that from about 0.1% - 1.5% ν/ν lactic acid will be effective, in particular 0.5% - 1.5%, 0.8% - 1.2%, 0.9% - 1.1% or 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9%, 1.0%, 1.1%, 1.2%, 1.3%, 1.4% or 1.5%. In a further related aspect of the present invention it has been determined that the anti-inflammatory properties of lactic acid are functional when lactic acid is used at physiologically relevant pH levels. Without limiting the present invention to any one theory or more of action, lactic acid is generally found in the lower human female reproductive tract at a pH of 3.5. To this end, lactic acid has now been determined to exhibit anti-inflammatory functionality when used at a pH level of as low as pH 2.8 up to about pH 4.2, preferably pH 3.2-3.8. In accordance with these aspects of the invention, in one embodiment said female mammal is a human. In another embodiment, said reproductive tract is the vagina and said genital tissue is the genital mucosa. In yet another embodiment, η is an integer from 0 to 5. In still another embodiment η is 0. In yet still another embodiment, η is 0 and Pr is hydrogen. In a further embodiment, said organic acid is lactic acid. In yet a another related aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of down-regulating the inflammation in the reproductive tract or genital tissue of a female mammal said method comprising the mucosal administration of a composition comprising lactic acid wherein said mucosa is contacted with an effective concentration of 0.3% 1.5% ν/ν of said lactic acid. In another embodiment said concentration is 0.3% - 1.4%, 0.3% - 1.3%, 0.3% - 1.2%, 0.3% - 1.1% or 0.3% - 1.0% ν/ν. In another embodiment, said concentration is 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%,0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9%, 1.0%, 1.1%, 1.2%, 1.3%, 1.4%, 1.5% ν/ν. In accordance with the method of the present invention, the composition defined herein may be coadministered with one or more other compounds or molecules. By “coadministered” is meant simultaneous administration in the same formulation or in two different formulations via the same or different routes or sequential administration by the same or different routes. For example, the subject agent may be administered together with an agonistic agent in order to enhance its effect or with another active ingredient selected to treat a symptom or cause of said inflammation. By “sequential” administration is meant a time difference of from second, minutes, hours or days between the administration of the two types of molecules. These molecules may be administered in any order. In one embodiment, the composition of the present invention may be formulated together with a one or more ingredients designed to sooth or otherwise provide immediate relief from the symptoms associated with vaginal or genital inflammation, such as those associated with vaginitis or vaginosis, these symptoms including: • irritation and/or itching of the genital area; • inflammation (irritation, redness, and swelling caused by the presence of extra immune cells) of the labia majora, labia minora, or perineal area; • vaginal discharge; • foul vaginal odour; • pain/irritation with sexual intercourse. In another embodiment, and to the extent that the composition of the present invention is designed to prophylactically or therapeutically treat pathogen-induced vaginitis or vaginosis, one may seek to formulate the composition together with a microbicide. Without limiting the present invention to any one theory or mode of action, a microbicide is a compound or substance which reduces the infectivity of a pathogen, such as a bacterium, vims, parasite, fungus or the like. Examples of microbicides which one may seek to use include, but are not limited to: • antibiotics • bactericides disinfectants • fungicides • detergents (eg. nonoxynol-9, SAVVY) • pH modifiers (eg. buffer gel) • antiretroviral based microbicides (eg. tenofovir based microbicide, integrase inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors (such as ΡΜΡΑ, VC-781, TMC120, MIV 150), entry inhibitors (including but not limited to CCR5, CXCR4 antagonists, antibodies to CD4, dendrimer, carbohydrates (Griffithsin)), HIV protease inhibitors, Cyanovirin, HIV neutralizing Abs. linear polyanions (e.g. Carraguard, dextran sulphate, PR02000). According to this embodiment, there is therefore provided a method of down-regulating inflammation in the reproductive tract or genital tissue of a female mammal said method comprising the mucosal administration of a composition comprising a microbicide together with an organic acid having the formula (I) or in vivo hydrolysable esters or phosphate esters and salts thereof: wherein η is an integer from 1 to 10; wherein Pr is hydrogen or an in vivo hydrolysable protecting group; and wherein the compound is in the form of a racemate, enantiomer or a mixture of enantiomers and wherein said mucosa is contacted with an effective concentration of approximately 0.1% - 1.9% ν/ν of said organic acid. In accordance with this embodiment said female mammal is preferably a human. In another embodiment, said reproductive tract is the vagina and said genital tissue is the genital mucosa. In yet another embodiment, η is an integer from 0 to 5. In still another embodiment η is 0. In yet still another embodiment, η is 0 and Pr is hydrogen. In a further embodiment, said organic acid is lactic acid. In a still further embodiment, said composition does not comprise carboxylic acids other than the organic acid of formula (I). In yet still another embodiment, said composition comprises a concentration of 0.1% 1.9%, preferably 0.2% - 1.8%, 0.3% - 1.5%, 0.3% - 1.6%, 0.3% - 1.5%, 0.3% - 1.4%; 0.3% - 1.3%, 0.3% - 1.2%, 0.3% - 1.1% or 0.3% - 1.0% ν/ν of the organic acid of formula (I). As detailed hereinbefore, a further aspect of the present invention relates to the use of the invention in relation to the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disease conditions or other unwanted conditions which are characterised by an inflammatory response. The present invention therefore contemplates a method of therapeutically or prophylactically treating a condition characterised by an aberrant, unwanted or otherwise inappropriate inflammatory response in the reproductive tract or the genital tissue of a female mammal said method comprising the mucosal administration of a composition comprising an organic acid having the formula (I) or in vivo hydrolysable esters or phosphate esters and salts thereof: wherein η is an integer from 1 to 10; wherein Pr is hydrogen or an in vivo hydrolysable protecting group; and wherein the compound is in the form of a racemate, enantiomer or a mixture of enantiomers and wherein said mucosa is contacted with an effective concentration of approximately 0.1% - 1.9% ν/ν of said organic acid. In a related aspect there is provided the use of a composition comprising an organic acid having the formula (I) or in vivo hydrolysable esters or phosphate esters and salts thereof: wherein η is an integer from 1 to 10; wherein Pr is hydrogen or an in vivo hydrolysable protecting group; and wherein the compound is in the form of a racemate, enantiomer or a mixture of enantiomers in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment or prophylaxis of a condition characterised by an aberrant, unwanted or otherwise inappropriate inflammatory response in the reproductive tract or genital tissues of a female mammal and wherein said mucosa is contacted with an effective concentration of approximately 0.1% - 1.9% ν/ν of said organic acid. Reference to an “aberrant, unwanted or otherwise inappropriate” inflammatory response should be understood as a reference to an excessive response, an inadequate response or to a physiologically normal response which is inappropriate in that it is unwanted or otherwise inappropriate. Examples of aberrant or otherwise unwanted inflammatory responses include those which occur in the context of infectious vaginitis, atrophic vaginitis, irritant vaginitis, pelvic inflammatory disease or traumatic injury, such as occurs with surgery. In this regard, however, some forms of inflammation associated with irritant vaginitis in fact reflect normal physiological responses which are unwanted, such as those which occur in the context of an allergy. In one embodiment, said condition is infectious vaginitis, vaginosis, atrophic vaginitis, irritant vaginitis or traumatic injury. In another embodiment, said condition is caused by a pathogen. Reference to “infection” should be understood as a reference to the detrimental or otherwise unwanted colonisation of the reproductive tract of a female mammal by a pathogen. To this end, the subject infection may occur in any one or more regions, or parts, of the reproductive tract (such as in the context of one or more tissue regions). It may also be an infection which, although being evident in all or part of the reproductive tract, is also found in non-reproductive tract tissues, regions or organs of the mammal. For example, although HIV infection can be introduced via the reproductive tract tissue it is ultimately an infection which spreads systemically. Still further reference to an infection “of’ the reproductive tract should be understood to encompass an infection which is only transiently present in the reproductive tract, such as an infection which enters the body by this route but ultimately localises elsewhere. In accordance with these aspects of the invention, said female mammal is preferably a human. In another embodiment, said reproductive tract is the vagina and said genital tissue is the genital mucosa. In yet another embodiment, η is an integer from 0 to 5. In still another embodiment η is 0. In yet still another embodiment, η is 0 and Pr is hydrogen. In a further embodiment, said organic acid is lactic acid. In a still further embodiment, said composition does not comprise carboxylic acids other than the organic acid of formula (I). In yet still another embodiment, said composition comprises a concentration of 0.1% 1.9%, preferably 0.2% - 1.8%, 0.3% - 1.5%, 0.3% - 1.6%, 0.3% - 1.5%, 0.3% - 1.4%, 0.3% - 1.3%, 0.3% - 1.2%, 0.3% - 1.1% or 0.3% - 1.0% ν/ν of the organic acid of formula (I). In another embodiment said concentration is 0.3% - 1.4%, 0.3% - 1.3%, 0.3% - 1.2%, 0.3% - 1.1% or 0.3% - 1.0% ν/ν. In another embodiment, said concentration is 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%,0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9%, 1.0%, 1.1%, 1.2%, 1.3%, 1.4%, 1.5% ν/ν. In still yet another embodiment, said composition is formulated together with a microbicide. It would be appreciated by the person of skill in the art that in formulating the composition of the present invention, surfactants may be added to the subject compositions. The surfactants may provide for better surface contact of the compositions with the vaginal mucosa by further reducing surface tension and promoting dispersal of the active substances. Surfactants that may be added include but are not limited to lauryl sulfate and teepol, and the like. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may further comprise other additives such as gelling agents, buffers, preservatives, detergents, oils, alcohols, emulsifiers, solubilisers, humectants, and bioadhesives. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention further comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier suitable for vaginal and/or vulvar drug administration. The compositions of the present invention may include a physiologically tolerable preservative. Suitable physiologically tolerable preservatives include bacteriostats, preservatives, inhibitors, and the like, such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl esters of parahydroxybenzoic acid (paraben); propyl gallate; sorbic acid and its sodium and potassium salts; propionic acid and its calcium and sodium salts; 6-acetoxy-2,4-dimethyl-m-dioxane; 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-l,3-diol; salicylanilides such as dibromosalicylanilide and tribromosalicylamilide, and cis isomer of l-(3-chloroallyl-3,5,7-triaza-l-azanidadamantane chloride; hexachlorophene; sodium benzoate; phenolic compounds such as butyl hydroxyanisole, butyl hydroxytoluene, chloro- and bromocresols, and chloro- and bromo-oxylenols; quaternary ammonium compound such as benzalkonium chloride; aromatic alcohols such as 2-phenylethyl alcohol and benzyl alcohol; chlorobutanol; quinoline derivatives such as iodochlorohydroxyquinoline; and the like. Preferably, the preservative is included in an amount in the range of about 0.05 to about 0.2 weight percent, on a total composition weight basis. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients that can be included in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, for example, physiologically tolerable surfactants, solvents, emollients, colorants, fragrances, and the like, which are well known in the art. The compositions of the invention are applied topically or otherwise locally to the vagina and/or genital mucosa of a patient. Other examples of local administration would include local injection. The pharmaceutical compositions may be applied in the form of a suppository, an ointment, cream, solid (eg. tablet, capsule, ovule, and suppository), solution, suspension, gel, foam, film, or liposomal composition. The composition may also be delivered as a flushable tissue used to clean the urogenital and anal mucosa. Ointments and creams, may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. One technique for applying the compositions of the claimed invention is to employ a single use packet (such as a small envelope-like structure or the like) containing an intended single unit dose. The packet is initially sealed, but is opened at the time of use by tearing, cutting, or the like at a desired or planned location in the packet after which the contents are directly administrable as labeled. The pharmaceutical compositions may also be contained within a vaginal ring, tampon, suppository, sponge, pillow, puff, or osmotic pump system. The dosage forms of the compositions may also be formulated in a sustained-release form, employing various polymers, fibers, resins, waxes, oils, or other pharmaceutical excipients used by those skilled in the art of medicinal chemistry to produce a prolonged release of the active constituents of the compositions. The total daily dose of the compositions of this invention administered to a human or lower animal may range from about 100 mg to about 15 g/day. More preferable doses can be in the range of from about 500 mg to about 5 g/day. If desired the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration; consequently, single dose compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of superfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilisation. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilised active ingredient into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and the freeze-drying technique which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. In a related aspect the present invention should be understood to extend to the formulation and administration of lactic acid producing bacteria rather than the lactic acid itself. This is a commonly used approach in the context of repopulating the flora of the gut. Without limiting the present invention to any one theory or mode of action, the genus Lactobacillus currently consists of over 180 species. The genus is polyphyletic, with the genus Pedeiococcus dividing the L. casei group, and the species L. acidophilus, L. salivarius, and L. reuteri being representatives of three distinct subclades. The genus Paralactobacillus falls within the L. salivarius group. In recent years, other members of the genus Lactobacillus (formerly known as the Leuconostoc branch of Lactobacillus) have been reclassified into the genera Atopobium, Carnobacterium, Weissella, Oenococcus, and Leuconostoc. More recently, the Pediococcus species Ρ. dextrinicus has been reclassified as a Lactobacillus species. The person of skill in the art would appreciate that one can select for use any suitable species which produces lactic acid. Means for preparing and administering Lactobacillus are known and could be adopted for administration to the reproductive tract. The present invention also relates to an article of manufacture comprising packaging material and a composition of the invention within the packaging material. The composition is present in an amount sufficient to treat vaginal inflammation in a patient, preferably in an amount equivalent to at least one unit does. The packaging material comprises a label that indicates that the composition can be used for treating vaginal inflammation. Preferably, the label includes other printed indicia such as a listing of ingredients, the manufacturer’s name and address, and the like. Preferably, the packaging material also includes a printed insert including detailed information on the composition, its method of administration for treatment of pathogenic vaginal biofilms, for example, and vaginal infections, side effects, contraindications, and the like indicia, which may be required by governmental agencies responsible for regulation of pharmaceutical products. In a further aspect, the present invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an organic acid having the formula (I) or in vivo hydrolysable esters or phosphate esters and salts thereof: wherein η is an integer from 1 to 10; wherein Pr is hydrogen or an in vivo hydrolysable protecting group; and wherein the compound is in the form of a racemate, enantiomer or a mixture of enantiomers together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or diluents. In one embodiment, η is an integer from 0 to 5. In still another embodiment, η is 0. In yet still another embodiment η is 0 and Pr is hydrogen. In a further embodiment, said organic acid is lactic acid. In a still further embodiment, said composition does not comprise carboxylic acids other than the organic acid of formula (I). In yet still another embodiment, said composition comprises a concentration of 0.1% 1.9%, preferably 0.2% - 1.8%, 0.3% - 1.7%, 0.3% - 1.6%, 0.3% - 1.5%, 0.3% - 1.4%, 0.3% - 1.3%, 0.3% - 1.2%, 0.3% - 1.1% or 0.3% - 1.0% ν/ν of the organic acid of formula (I). In another embodiment said concentration is 0.3% - 1.4%, 0.3% - 1.3%, 0.3% - 1.2%, 0.3% - 1.1% or 0.3% - 1.0% ν/ν. In another embodiment, said concentration is 0.3%, 0.4%, 0.5%, 0.6%,0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9%, 1.0%, 1.1%, 1.2%, 1.3%, 1.4%, 1.5% ν/ν. The present invention is further defined by reference to the following non-limiting examples. EXAMPLES DEFINITIONS: PIC - polyinosinic acid: cytidylic acid, poly (I:C) = viral TLR3 agonist VK2 - human epithelial cell lines from the vagina Ect - human epithelial cell lines from the ectocervix End - human epithelial cell lines from the endocervix L-LA - L-enantiomer lactic acid D-LA - D-enantiomer lactic acid TLR - Toll-like Receptor IL-# - Interleukin # IL-1RA - Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist HC1 - Hydrochloric acid FRT - female reproductive tract TNF - Tumour necrosis factor RANTES - regulates on activation, normal Τ cell expressed and secreted Μ1Ρ3α - Macrophage inflammatory protein 3 alpha EXAMPLE 1 A transwell culture system (Fig. 1) has been developed, which enables epithelial cells from the lower female reproductive tract to be incubated with concentrations of L-lactic acid approaching those found in the FRT in vivo without significant toxicity, allowing the direct impact of L-lactic acid and other acids to be evaluated in an in vitro model. Human epithelial cell lines from the vagina (VK2), ectocervix (Ect) and endocervix (End) originally generated by {Fichorova, 1997} and purchased from ATCC. These cells tolerated L-lactic acid concentrations up to 0.4% when added to the apical medium in the transwell system (Fig. 2Α). This same concentration was highly cytotoxic to cells when incubated in a standard plate format (data not shown) EXAMPLE 2 Concentrations of L-LA up to 0.3% had a minimal effect on the viability of VK2, epithelial cells (Fig. 2Α). 0.3% L-LA and D-LA had a similar but very small effect on VK2, End and Ect cell viability, while 0.3% L-LA neutralised to pH 7.4 or low pH alone (adjusted to pH 3.9 with HC1) was non-toxic (Fig. 2Β). EXAMPLE 3 This model can also be used to determine the effect of acids on monolayer integrity (Fig. 3Α) by measuring the diffusion rate of small (4 kDa, readily diffusible, Fig. 3Β) and large (70 kDa, largely non-diffusible, Fig. 3C) fluorescently labelled dextrans across the epithelial monolayer. We show that 0.3% L-lactic acid (pH 3.9) does not markedly alter the permeability and thus monolayer integrity of the VK2, Ect or End cell lines (Fig. 3D). Thus, L-LA at near physiologic concentrations and pH does not affect viability or permeability of the VK2, or Ect or End cell lines cultured in transwells. Virucidal, relatively non-toxic concentrations of L-LA (0.3%) elicit an anti-inflammatory response from epithelial cells of the FRT and reduce the pro-inflammatory response of cells to TLR-induced inflammation. D-LA had a similar anti-inflammatory effect, but L-LA at neutral pH nor low pH media alone did not. These results suggest the potential for LA to be used in topical microbicides to maintain an anti-inflammatory state in the FRT, and help reduce HIV susceptibility. EXAMPLE 4 An analysis was performed to determine if physiologic noncytotoxic concentrations of L-LA alter the release of immune modulators by VK2, End and Ect cells by incubating cells in transwells with L-LA for 24h at 37°C in serum free keratinocyte medium and harvesting supernatants (from the apical chamber) for release of immune modulators. 0.3% L-LA present in the apical medium reduces secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-6 (Fig. 4Α) and IL-8 (Fig. 4Β) induced by the TLR3 agonist PIC by epithelial cells from the FRT. A similar trend was observed with the bacterial TLR agonists Pam3Ck (TLR2) and lipopolysaccharide (TLR4) in End and Ect cells (see Fig. 7 for data from End cells). These data show that L-LA significantly reduces IL-6 and IL-8 production from epithelial cells. EXAMPLE 5 L-LA promotes the production of anti-inflammatory mediator, IL-1RA. Using similar culture conditions as in Fig. 4 it was determined that 0.3% L-LA (pH 3.9) induces IL-1RA production in VK2, End and Ect cell lines in the absence or presence of TLR3 agonist PIC (Fig. 5). The same result was obtained with bacterial TLR agonists Pam3Ck (TLR2) and lipopolysaccharide (TLR4) in all three cell lines (see Fig. 7 for data from End cells). Taken together, these data show that lactobacilli in the lower FRT produce L-lactic acid that may have an anti-inflammatory effect and could play a critical role in preventing immune cell activation, recruitment and thus HIV infection in vivo. EXAMPLE 6 Anti-inflammatory cytokine effects are mediated by L- and D-LA but not HCl or L-LA at neutral pH. L vs D-LA were evaluated at pH 3.9 and tested L-LA at pH 7.4 (Fig. 6) in Ect cells. It was also determined whether the effect being observed was due to LA or could be mediated by low pH alone by acidifying media to pH 3.9 with HCl. We found that both 0.3% L- and D-LA reduce secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators IL-6 and IL-8 induced by the TLR3 agonist PIC and increase IL-1RA production by Ect epithelial cells. However, neither neutralised L-LA nor HCl acidified media had any significant effect on decreasing levels of proinflammatory cytokines or increasing the production of the IL-1RA anti-inflammatory cytokine. A similar trend was observed with End and VK2 cells (data not shown). These data clearly show that the immune mediator effects of lactic acid is due to the protonated, uncharged form, can be observed with both lactic acid isomers found in the vagina, and is not simply due to acidity alone due to the inorganic acid, HCl. EXAMPLE 7 Methods for Examples 1-6 Cytokine Assay: Cytokines were measured using FlowCytomix assays, utilising the basic reagents kit, in conjunction with simplex kits for IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1RA (eBiosciences). Assays were carried out according to the manufactures instructions and standard operating procedures known to a person skilled in the art. Preparation of standards: Reconstitution: • Pulse spin vials then reconstitute with the volume of dtLO advised on the sample bottle. · Swirl vial to mix and wait 10-30 min before pipetting. Pulse spin tubes again before removing aliquot.

Vortex each bead mix for 5 secs, pipette beads up and down and aliquot volume required. Need 1/20 total volume of beads for each bead set ο ie. For 22 tests, need 330pL beads so need 16.5pL of each bead. Fill volume of bead mixture up to final volume with reagent dilution buffer. Centrifuge bead mix at 3000g for 5 min, remove excess liquid leaving 50pL s/n (ie if volume was 330pL, remove 280pL s/n). Add the same volume of reagent dilution buffer as was removed and vortex mix for 5 secs. Preparation of biotin-conjugate mix: • Require 30pL of mix per test. Calculate volume required - number of test (plus extra for pipetting) χ 30pL. • Pipette 1/20 of volume required of biotin-conjugate for each mix. ο ie for 22 tests, need 660pL mix and 33pL of EACH biotin-conjugate. · Fill volume up to final volume with reagent dilution buffer.

Calculate volume required ie number of tests (plus extra for pipetting) χ 30pL. · Mix 1/31.25 the final volume of concentrated Streptavidin-PE and fill up to final volume with 1 χ assay buffer. ο ie. For 22 tests, need 660pL of 1 χ Streptavidin-PE, so 21.1pL of concentrated Streptavidin-PE + 639pL of 1 χ assay buffer. Test procedure 1. Calculate required volumes of reagents and make standards, bead mixtures and biotin-conjugate as described above. 2. Add 15pL of either standard, sample or blank (1 χ assay buffer) to appropriately labelled tubes. 3. Add 15pL of prepared bead mixture to each tube. 4.

Discard s/n, leaving approx. lOOpL. Repeat for a total of 2 washes. 11. Discard s/n from final wash, leaving 100-200pL of buffer. Analyse samples on the flow cytometer within 24 hours (preferable the same day as the experiment). Analysis on Flow Cytometer • Bead fluorescence is FL3 and analyte signal in FL2 (PE). · Use setup beads to set parameters before each experiment and standard 1 for final instrument settings. • Do not change voltage, compensation or flow rate during experiment. Setup: 1. Prepare a vial of setup beads; vortex vial then pipette 500pL beads into a labelled tube. 2. In setup mode, open a new protocol and create a dot plot window for FSC vs SSC (linear mode) and two windows of FL2 (PE) on χ axis and FL3 (far red) on y axis (log mode). 3. Use setup beads to adjust FSC and SSC so both bead populations are visible. Gate the larger beads as R1 and the smaller population as R2. 4. Select R1 in the first dot plot and R2 in the second. Adjust FL2 voltage so beads are position in far left. Adjust FL3 voltage so bead populations are clearly separated. 5. Run standard 1. Adjust FL2 so the beads touch the right hand axis. If bead populations are not horizontal, increase FL3 compensation. Save settings. Acquisition: 1. Switch to acquisition mode, and set up file name and save location (files should be χχ.001, χ.002). 2. Run samples and acquire 300 beads in R2 per analyte ie 5 analytes = 1500 events. EXAMPLE 8 Methods for Examples 1-7 • The effect of virucidal concentrations of L-LA on epithelial cells from the FRT was assessed using the vaginal (VK2), endocervical (End) and ectocervical (Ect) epithelial cell lines seeded into transwells. • Toxicity and epithelial monolayer integrity were determined by cell viability staining and diffusion of fluorescently labelled dextrans, respectively. Cytokine release from cells stimulated for 24 h with toll-like receptor (TLR) in the absence or presence of L-LA was determined using a flow cytometry-based bead assay (FlowCytomix, eBiosciences). • The effect of D-LA and L-LA at neutral pH was also determined and compared to media pH adjusted to low pH with HC1. Results L- and D-LA induce an anti-inflammatory state in FRT epithelial cells and inhibit the pro-inflammatory response to TLR agonists • Stimulation of epithelial cell lines with TLR2, 3 and 4 agonists induced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-6. (Fig. 7) EXAMPLE 9 Inflammatory effects of L-Lactic acid in the presence of PIC on epithelial cells Results Figure 8 shows that L-LA reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 (Β), IL-8 (C), TNFa (D), HIV-promoting chemokines RANTES (Ε) and MIP3a (F) induced by TLR agonists from lower FRT epithelial cells. L-LA induced a significant increase in anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1RA (A). This trend was seen with VK2 and Ect cells. EXAMPLE 10 Time course of inflammatory effects of L-Lactic acid in the presence of PIC on epithelial cells Results To determine the minimum time required to elicit cytokine/chemokine production, cells were stimulated with PIC in the presence of absence of L-LA (as per Figure 9) and cytokine production measured at 30 minutes, 1 hour and 18 hours. Figure 9 demonstrates a 30 minute treatment of L-LA is sufficient for the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1RA (A) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 (Β), IL-8 (C), TNFa (D), HIV-promoting chemokines RANTES (Ε) and Μ1Ρ3α (F) induced by TLR agonists from lower FRT epithelial cells. This trend was seen with VK2 and Ectl cells. EXAMPLE 11 Inflammatory effects of L-Lactic acid in the presence of PIC on primary ectocervical cells Culture of human primary ectocervical cells in transwells. Results To further qualify the data in Example 9, we repeated the experiment with primary ectocervical cells. Figure 10 demonstrates a trend similar to that of LA treatment of cells lines with the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1RA (A) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 (Β), IL-8 (C), TNFa (D), HIV-promoting chemokines RANTES (Ε) and Μ1Ρ3α (F) induced by TLR agonists from lower FRT epithelial cells. EXAMPLE 12 Methods for Examples 1-11 Passaging and LA-treating epithelial cells from the female genital tract Cell lines and propagation All cells are epithelial cells transformed with Ε6Ε7 from HPV-16 Table 1: Cell lines Source Name Cell type ATCC ID Vaginal VK2/E6E7 Epithelial CRL-2616 Endocervix End/E6E7 Epithelial CRL-2615 Ectocervix Ectl/E6E7 Epithelial CRL-2614 Protocols for propagation and subculturing are provided on the ATCC website and are identical for all three cell types. The subculturing protocol used in the RBA lab is a slight modification of this and is listed below. Media Cells are grown in serum free keratinocyte media (Cat # 17005-042 from Life Technologies) supplemented with the following per 100ml media(Table 2.) Table 2: Media supplement * Check stock concentrations on individual aliquots as they vary from batch to batch. Supplement Final Cone.

Cells can be grown in 5mL SFKM per Τ25. Seeding cells for LA treatment. Transwells are used for LA treatments. Inserts are for 24 well plates and have a diameter of approx. 6mm (ie the size of a 96 well plate well), and a pore size of 0.4μΜ which is the smallest pore size available. Both BD (Cat #353495) and Corning (Cat # 3413) inserts have been used and both have a high pore density (1 χ 108 per cm2); a trial of the BD inserts with a lower pore density yielded poor results so avoid these. Larger transwell insert sizes can be used, with volumes/cell numbers below scaled up appropriately. • For seeding into transwells, add 500pL media into the bottom reservoir and 100,000 cells in a volume of 200pL media into the upper transwell reservoir (membrane are = 0.33cm2 ie that of a 96 well plate). • Cells should be seeded then cultured for 7 days prior to LA treatment (change media on day 3 or 4 post seeding). • Perform all addition/wash steps involving eth transwells gentry to avoid disrupting the cell monolayer and never touch pipette tips to the transwell membrane. For LA treatment and assessment of toxicity/membrane permeability Cytokine release, toxicity and membrane permeability can be assessed using the same transwell sample. Caveat: as membrane permeability is assessed after toxicity using this protocol, we cannot rule out that the 1.5hr MTS treatment may affect membrane permeability, although if all samples are treated similarly it can be assumed that the effect is the same for all. Otherwise, duplicate transwells can be set up for toxicity/membrane permeability experiments. • Remove media from well and reservoir. Add 400pL fresh SFKM to lower reservoir and 100pL of appropriate LA or control-containing media (in SFKM) to upper well and incubate for designated period (typically 18-24hr for cytokine production). • After incubation, remove s/n from upper reservoir and aliquot into appropriately labelled tubes and freeze at -80°C for future cytokine analysis. ΝΒ A sample of the media in the lower reservoir can also be stored for analysis. A small number of samples were used to compare the concentrations of cytokines in the upper and lower reservoirs after treatment and were found to be similar ie probably don’t need to measure both. • Remove media from lower reservoir and wash both lower reservoir (500pL/wash) and transwell (200pL/wash) twice with PBS. · Add 400pL fresh SKFM to lower reservoir and 100pL of SFKM containing 18pL MTS reagent to upper reservoir and incubate at 37°C for up to 90 mins. • Remove 50-80pL of MTS-containing media from upper transwell and transfer to a 96-well plate for analysis on plate reader. Read MTS at A490nm (background at 320ηΜ). Some volume of media from the upper reservoir is lost during the incubation, so don’t try and transfer 100pL as you will have unequal volumes from each well. 50-80pL is adequate. • After MTS treatment, wash reservoir and transwell insert with PBS as described above. • Add 400pL fresh SFKM to lower reservoir and 100pL of SFKM containing 2mg/ml final each of FITC labelled 4kDa dextran (Sigma Cat # FD4, lOOmg) and Rhodamine labelled 70kDa dextran (Sigma Cat # R9379, lOOmg). Dextrans come as a powder and are dissolves in sterile PBS- to a concentration of lOOmg/ml. 2pL of each dextran is required per well, but make a mastermix for all wells. Incubate at 37°C for 3 hours. A sample (50pL) of media from the lower reservoir can be taken at 1, 2 and 3hrs to examine the timecourse of uptake, otherwise take a single sample at 3hrs after addition. Analyse sample in white optical plates on the Fluorstar in Fluorescence mode, ο Excitation/emission filters used for FITC and Rhodamine are 490/520 and 510/590 respectively. ο Ensure correct leads are attached for fluorescence reading, ο Allow machine to warm up for 10-15 min prior to using. Treatment ofFGT cells with TLR agonists The following concentrations of TLR agonists (Table 3.) have been used to activate FGT cells either alone of added with LA-containing media for 18-24 hours.

Cells were cultured and treated in serum free keratinocyte media (SFKM) containing supplements as per ATCC recommendations. Cells were seeded in 6mm transwell inserts at a density of 100,000 cells per well, and cultured for 7 days prior to treatment. Cells were treated in 100pL of SFKM containing the relevant stimulus for 1 hour, before treatment media was removed and upper and lower chambers of the transwells were washed with PBS-, and fresh SFKM added. Cells were subsequently incubated for an addition 18 hours to allow cytokine production. Cytokine-containing supernatants were collected and stored at -80°C for future analysis and cell viability assessed via MTS assay as per manufacturer’s recommendations. Cyto/chemokine analysis: Levels of relevant cyto/chemokines in cell culture supernatants was measured using the Procartaplex multiplex system with analysis on the BioRad Luminex Platform as per protocol. The following factors were measured: anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-1RA), pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, TNF, IL-1 β), and chemokine (RANTES, Μ1Ρ3α). Treatment agents: Table 4 details the LA-containing gels and excipient acids tested in this analysis. The 3 vaginal gels were very viscous, so were diluted 1/5 in SFKM and sterile filtered prior to use. Lactacyd was less viscous and could be diluted V2 in SFKM. A 1% citric acid stock (in H20) was used to make treatment media. Benzoic acid is insoluble in water, thus a 2% solution was made in DMSO, sterile filtered and used for making treatment media. Table 1: Feminine gels/products and acid excipients tested Product Product details [LA] [LA] (inhouse assay)# Other ingredients Dilution for «0.3% LA LA-containing gels: Caya Vaginal gel 5.5% ≈8% ≈1/20 Gynofit Vaginal gel Not stated «1.5% ≈1/5 Acidform Vaginal gel 2% (as per product insert) «1.5% 1 % citric acid 0.2% benzoic acid ≈1/5 Lactacyd Feminine wash «0.1% Acids contained in LA-gels: Benzoic acid Present in Acidform 0.03% Citric acid 0.15% # Measured using an in vitro D/L-LA assay kit (Roche). No D-LA was detected. NOTE: The pH of all treatment media containing gels/acids was adjusted to pH 3.9 (to match that of 0.3% LA) prior to treatment. This was performed to ensure that a similar concentration of protonated LA, the active form of LA, was compared. A pH control (media adjusted to pH 3.9 with HC1) was included to determine the effect of low pH alone. Due to the poor buffering capacity of HC1, treatments containing HC1 were refreshed every 20 min during the 1 hour treatment time to ensure the low pH of the treatment media was maintained. Results Toxicity The viability of Ect epithelial cells following treatment with a range of concentrations of the excipients citric and benzoic acid was assessed. Neither benzoic nor citric acid had any significant effect on cell viability at the concentrations tested (Figure 11). Figure 11 demonstrates the viability of Ect cells 18 hours after 1 hour incubation with the listed concentrations (%) of benzoic and citric acid. Viability of cells treated with LA and low pH alone (HC1) are shown for comparison. Data expressed as % viability as compared to untreated cells and are the mean and SD of 2 independent experiments (ΝΒ η=1 for 0.2% benzoic acid). Note that dilutions of benzoic acid above 0.2% were insoluble. Effect of acids on cytokine production by Ect cells To determine whether the acid excipients themselves influenced the inflammatory state of Ect cells, levels of anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured in culture supernatants following treatment with various concentrations of benzoic or citric acid. Neither acid was associated with an altered expression of the anti-inflammatory agent IL-1RA (Figure 12Α) or the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 (Figure 12Β). Levels of other immune mediators including IL-8, Μ1Ρ3α, TNF, IL-1B and RANTES were similarly unaltered by treatment with these acids (not shown). Effects of acids on the anti-inflammatory actions of LA To determine whether the presence of benzoic or citric acid would interfere with the anti-inflammatory actions of LA, Ect cells were stimulated with LA in the absence or presence of 0.03% benzoic acid or 0.15% citric acid. These concentrations were selected as they represent the same ratio to LA as present in a dilution of Acidform containing 0.3% LA (see Table 4). Figure 12C shows that although the presence of benzoic and citric acid at these concentrations was associated with slightly lower levels, the LA-induced production of IL-1RA from Ect cells was largely preserved. Next, we determined whether these concentrations of benzoic and acetic acid affected the ability of LA to block TLRmediated inflammation. Ect cells were incubated with the TLR3 agonist Poly (I:C) (PIC) and LA in the absence or presence of 0.03% benzoic acid or 0.15% citric acid. The effect of benzoic and citric acid alone on the PIC-induced inflammatory response was also assessed. Figure 13 shows that LA inhibits the PIC-induced production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 (Β), IL-6 (C) and TNF (D), and that this effect persists in the presence of either benzoic or citric acid. A similar trend was observed with the PIC-induced production of the chemokines RANTES and Μ1Ρ3α (not shown). Benzoic and citric acid alone did not appear to alter PIC-induced cytokine production to a greater level that seen with low pH treatment alone (HC1). Whilst neither citric nor benzoic acid altered the production of IL-1RA (A) from cell stimulated with PIC, the presence of citric acid in combination with PIC and LA did result in a reduced production of the anti-inflammatory molecule IL-1RA as compared to cells stimulated with LA and PIC; the reproducibility and implications of this require further investigation. Conclusion Benzoic and citric acid, present as excipients in the vaginal gel Acidform, do not have a significant effect on the viability or inflammatory state (as indicated by cytokine production profile) of Ect epithelial cells. Neither benzoic or citric acid, when present at a ratio equivalent to that found in Acidform gel, appear to significantly impair the anti-inflammatory actions of 0.3% LA. These data cannot exclude the possibility that concentrations of benzoic (0.2%) and citric acid (1%) present in neat ACIDFORM may negate the anti-inflammatory effects of LA. Assessment of the toxicity and anti-inflammatory effects of LA-containing feminine gels Toxicity The viability of Ect epithelial cells following treatment with dilutions of feminine hygiene products containing an LA concentration of approximately 0.3% (see Table 4) was assessed. The viability of cells treated with the diluted Caya, Gynofit and Acidformcontaining media was similar to that of cells treated with 0.3% LA (Figure 14). Treatment of cells with diluted Lactacyd resulted in cells detaching and being washed off the transwells. This product is actually a wash and is for external use only, thus analysis of the effects of this product were not analysed further. Effect of gels on cytokine production by Ect cells To determine whether the LA-containing gels were able to elicit a similar anti-inflammatory effect to that of LA alone, Ect cells were treated with the diluted gels and cytokine production measured. All 3 gels elicited increased production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-1RA (Figure 15Α) to a similar extent to that seen with 0.3% LA alone. All gels were also able to reduce the basal production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 to a level similar to that seen with LA alone (Figure 15Β), although the Gynofit gel showed a more subtle effect on IL-6 production. Both LA alone and LA-containing gels elicited a similar but small increase in production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-ip, but levels were below the limit of detection of the assay (data not shown). There were no obvious differences in the production of other cytokines/chemokines (ie RANTES) between cells treated with LA-containing gels or LA alone (not shown). Effect of LA-containing gels on PIC-induced inflammation To determine whether LA-containing gels could inhibit the inflammatory response of PIC-induced cells to a similar extent to LA alone, cells were stimulated with PIC in the presence of absence of diluted gels (as per Figure 15) and cytokine production measured. Figure 16 shows that all 3 gels inhibited PIC-induced production of IL-6 (C), TNF (D), RANTES (Ε) and Μ1Ρ3α (F) similar to that observed with LA alone, although for some cytokines (eg TNF) the Gynofit gel showed reduced activity as compared to Caya and Acidform. Acidform, and to a lesser extent Caya, also reduced PIC-mediated IL-8 (Β) production. Conclusion The LA-containing feminine hygiene gels tested here required a significant dilution to achieve the physiological concentrations of LA which we have found to have anti-inflammatory properties. The LA-containing gels, diluted to a concentration that is equivalent to 0.3% LA, do not significant toxicity and elicit a similar production of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-1RA to LA alone. Similar to LA alone, the LA-containing gels are able to inhibit the PIC-mediated production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines for Ect cells, suggesting the LA contained in these agents retains its anti-inflammatory effect.
