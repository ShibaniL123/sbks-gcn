METHOD OF TREATING SKIN CONDITIONS Background of the Invention The sebaceous glands are microscopic glands in the skin that secrete sebum, a mixture of waxes, fatty acids, di- and tri-glycerides, squalene and cholesterol. These glands are found on all surfaces of the body, except the palms and the soles of the feet. A number of medical conditions are associated with sebaceous glands, including acne, seborrheic cysts, sebaceous hyperplasia, seborrhea, seborrheic dermatitis, sebaceous adenomas and seborrhea and sebaceoma. Accordingly, there is a need for new therapies that can target these disorders. Summary of the Invention The invention pertains, at least in part, to a method of treating a disorder associated with sebaceous glands comprising, administering to a subject an effective amount of 2- ((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. In some embodiments, the disorder is selected from acne, seborrhea, sebaceoma, sebaceous carcinoma, sebborheic dermatitis, sebborheic cysts, sebaceous adenoma and sebaceous hyperplasia. The invention also pertains, at least in part, to a method of inducing sebaceous gland atrophy in a subject comprising, administering to a subject an effective amount of 2- ((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The invention further pertains, at least in part, to a method of reducing sebum production in a subject, comprising administering to a subject an effective amount of 2- ((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.

Exemplification of the Invention MATERIALS AND METHODS Test Substance 2-((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid was synthesised by AstraZeneca R&D, Alderley Park, UK and has been confirmed to show selective DGAT1 inhibitory activity (Barlind et al. 2012). In an in vitro recombinant mouse, dog, and human DGAT1 enzyme assay, 2-((1f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin- 2-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid had an IC50 of approximately 100, 60 and 80 nM, respectively and an IC50 of >35000 nM against human ACAT1 and ACAT2 enzymes. No activity against human DGAT2 was detected. For in vivo experiments, 2-((1f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2- yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid was formulated as a suspension of up to 100 mg/ml in water containing HPMC/Tween (0.5% hydroxypropylmethycellulose + 0.1 % polysorbate 80, Sigma-Aldrich, UK) which served as the vehicle control. Generally, 2-((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6- carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid and the vehicle were formulated on the day prior to study start and remade every 7 days where necessary. The suspensions were stirred continuously from preparation throughout use and protected from light. Experimental Design Doses and frequency of dosing were selected following consideration of species specific tolerability and pharmacokinetic parameters. Doses predicted to result in exposures which were likely to cause maximum DGAT1 inhibition without resulting in intolerability were chosen as the highest dose level. Animals were randomized into groups according to their body weight and dosed daily with 2-((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2- yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid or vehicle, orally by gavage. Toxicokinetic sampling on the last day of dosing prior to necropsy was employed to assess the exposure profiles of animals given 2-((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2- yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid. Experimental Procedures Up to 32 (16 male and 16 female) mice (Crl:CD-1 (ICR)) per dose group were obtained from the AstraZeneca breeding unit (Alderley Park, Macclesfield, UK). The animals, aged 7-8 weeks, were allowed to acclimatise for at least one week, were multiple-housed, sexes separately, up to 5/cage. Water from the site drinking water supply and RM1 (E) SQC pelleted diet supplied by Special Diets Services Ltd., England, was freely available. Nesting material (Tapvei Aspen Chips, Tapvei small aspen bricks, Finland, sizzle nests and paper shavings, and polycarbonate tunnels, Datesand.UK) was provided. Animals were terminated for scheduled necropsy on the day after the final dose. The mice were killed by administration of halothane. 2-((1f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2- yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid was administered orally, once daily, to mice at 100, 300, and 600 mg/kg for 7 days, 0, 10, 80, and 300 mg/kg for 1 month, and 0, 1 , 10, 60, and 300 mg/kg for up to 6 months. In order to compare the effects of DGAT1 inhibition mediated by 2-((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6- carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid on the skin with skin effects due to genetic DGAT1 deficiency, DGAT1 (-/-) mice were obtained from the AZ breeding unit (AstraZeneca Molndal, Gothenburg, Sweden). To construct the DGAT1 gene targeting vector, 5.0 kb, 3.4 kb and 1.5 kb genomic DNA fragments were prepared from a BAC clone, which contained approximately 200 kb C57BI/6 genomic sequence including the Dgatl gene (ResGen, Invitrogen Corporation), for 5' homology, deletion and 3' homology sequences respectively. The fragments were cloned into a loxP floxed PGKneo plasmid, using standard cloning techniques. In brief, a 3.3 kb fragment containing exons 3 to 17 of DGAT1 was inserted between an isolated loxP site and loxP-flanked PGK-Neomycin resistance cassette and then inserted between the two homology sequences. The DGAT1 targeting vector was linearized and electroporated into C57BI/6 (PRX-B6N #1 , Primogenix) mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and ES cell clones were selected with G418 (300 μg/ml). Candidate ES cell clones were screened by PCR and targeting was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using standard protocols. Targeted ES cells were injected into BALB/cAnNCrl blastocysts and injected embryos were implanted into the uteruses of pseudo-pregnant BALB/cAnNCrl mice. Chimeric males were mated with C57BI/6 females and resulting heterozygous F1 males were bred with Rosa26Cre transgenic mice on a C57BI/6 background to delete the loxP floxed region, including exons 3 to 17 in DGAT1 , and the Neomycin cassette. DGAT1 null mice were obtained by heterozygote intercrossing and the mutations were confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. Animals were kept in pathogen free environment and routinely screened for pathogens. Prior to the animal studies mice, aged 6-12 weeks, were allowed to acclimatise for at least one week, were multiple-housed, sexes separately, up to 5/cage. Water from the site drinking water supply and RM1 (E) SQC pelleted diet supplied by Special Diets Services Ltd., England, was freely available. Nesting material (Tapvei Aspen Chips, Tapvei small aspen bricks, Finland, sizzle nests and paper shavings, and polycarbonate tunnels, Datesand.UK) was provided. Animals were killed by administration of halothane. Up to 8 (4 male and 4 female) beagle dogs per treatment group were obtained from the AstraZeneca breeding unit (Alderley Park, Macclesfield, UK). The animals, aged 12 to 24 months, were allowed to acclimatise for at least one week, were multiply housed and given ad libitum access to water and standard dog diet (Diet 125 C3, Safe, France). 2-((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid was administered orally, once daily, to dogs at 100 and 1000 mg/kg/day for 7 days, and twice daily at 0, 20, 160, and 2000 mg/kg/day for 14 days, 0, 4, 20, 140, and 500 mg/kg/day for up to 3 months, and 0, 4, 16, and 100 mg/kg/day for up to 6 months. All animals were observed daily for clinical signs of toxicity. Body weight and food consumption was measured daily prior to dosing. Animals were single-penned, with access to an exercise area with others of the same sex and group, for the major part of each day. Animals had free access to water from the site drinking water supply. A set weight of SDS Dog-D3 (E) SQC, supplied by Special Diet Services Ltd, England, was provided daily, in the afternoon, access being allowed for up to approximately 2 hours. Toys (e.g., bones) were provided for additional environmental enhancement. Animals were terminated for scheduled necropsy on the day after the final dose. The dogs were killed by intravenous administration of sodium pentobarbitone and then exsanguinated. All studies were conducted in strict adherence to the UK Home Office regulations for animal welfare (Animal Scientific Procedures 1986 Act). For pharmacokinetic analysis, blood samples were collected into lithium heparin tubes from animals on either the first or penultimate day of the study. Plasma was separated by centrifugation at 4°C and stored for analysis at -20°C. Plasma concentrations of 2- ((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and pharmacokinetic parameters of maximum plasma drug concentration (Cmax) and concentration at the dose interval (Cmin) calculated. Exposure data are presented as FDM (free drug concentration in blood plasma required to inhibit the microsomal DGAT1 enzyme by 50%) and are mean data for each dose level. Due to a significant (-1.5 - 3x) sex difference in mice, separate data points are given for male and female mice. There was no sex difference in dogs and data points are mean data of males and females combined. At the end of each experiment, animals were terminally anaesthetised and representative samples of skin (mammary gland region for mice, abdominal region for dogs) were taken at necropsy, placed in 10% buffered formalin and processed for histopathological assessment. Conventional processing into wax and haematoxylin and eosin staining of sections preceded their light microscopic examination. Light microscopic examination and histology scoring was performed by a certified pathologist and findings were peer reviewed by a second pathologist. Each section of skin contained from 15 - 25 hair follicles in different stages of differentiation with associated sebaceous glands that were cut in multiple planes. There was no difference in sebaceous gland appearances within or between tissue sections from control animals, i.e., there was no apparent alteration in sebaceous cell morphology related to stage of hair follicle differentiation. Therefore, assessment of sebaceous cell/gland atrophy was based on their appearances irrespective of the stage of differentiation of the associated hair follicle in all instances. Severity scores ranged from no change by comparison with controls, to severe, which was defined as the total absence of sebaceous glands in all skin tissue sections examined from an individual animal. Minimal severity was defined as sebaceous cell numbers per gland being as that seen in controls but cell size was uniformly reduced, mild as a small reduction in sebaceous cell numbers but with substantially reduced (and variable) cell size, and moderate, as very few cells remaining that appeared shrunken. Effects of DGATI inhibition in the mouse 2-((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid was administered to mice, orally, once daily, for 7, 28 or 180 days at doses predicted to cause minimal to substantial DGAT1 inhibition over the dose interval. Toxicokinetic analysis revealed that Cmax was above the mouse microsomal DGAT1 enzyme IC50 at all dose levels, ranging from 4x IC50 in the 1 mg/kg/day dose group in the 180 day study to 1581x IC50 in the 600 mg/kg/day dose group in the 7 day study. For all dose levels and durations Cmin was above the DGAT1 IC50 for the duration of the dose interval, ranging from just 1x IC50 in the 1 mg/kg/day dose group in the 180 day study to 766x IC50 in the 600 mg/kg/day dose group in the 7 day study, respectively. In the mouse, administration of 2-((1f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2- yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid was well tolerated in all studies. Significant drug-induced sebaceous gland atrophy in the skin characterised by a reduction in size of sebaceous glands attached to each hair follicle was detected upon histopathological examination of skin samples (Figure 1). Histopathological data from the 1 month and 6 month studies indicated that sebaceous gland atrophy did not occur when group mean exposures were ≤ 6x FDM at Cmax and 1.5x at Cmin during the dose interval. Sebaceous gland atrophy of minimal severity occurred at mean exposures of 22x FDM at Cmax and 10x Cmin, indicating the necessity of a high level of continuous DGAT1 enzyme inhibition for this morphological change to occur. At higher exposures minimal to mild sebaceous gland atrophy was noted at 50 - 260x FDM at Cmax and 7 - 40x FDM at Cmin and mild to moderate sebaceous gland atrophy was noted at an exposure of 226x FDM at Cmax and 46x FDM at Cmin. The relationship between FDM (Cmax and Cmin) during the dose interval and severity of sebaceous gland atrophy is shown in Figure 2. In addition to a relationship between 2-((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5- dimethylpyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid exposure and level of sebaceous gland atrophy, an association between duration of exposure and level of this finding was observed. Whilst sebaceous gland atrophy was absent in mice treated with high doses of 2-((1 f?,4f?)-4- (4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid for up to 7 days, the group mean severity of this finding ranged from minimal to mild after 1 month (28 days) of dosing which increased to minimal to moderate severity after 6 months (180 days) of dosing (Figure 3). Following a 4 week drug-free period the observed sebaceous gland atrophy noted after 1 month of treatment had resolved, indicating complete reversibility of this finding (Figure 1). However, reversibility was not assessed following 6 months of dosing. Whilst histopathological findings in the skin, following administration of AZD7687 for 1 month, were restricted to sebaceous gland atrophy only, after dosing for 6 months, this finding was also associated with epidermal hyperplasia, occasional hair follicle atrophy, as well as in-life observation of hair-loss and skin lesions (i.e., open wounds and scabs). These additional skin findings occurred at exposure levels of at least 50x FDM at Cmax and 7x FDM at Cmin , levels which were sufficient to cause substantial DGAT1 inhibition during the dose interval and were noted to be more significant at higher levels of sebaceous gland atrophy (Figure 4). There were no notable sex differences, the only exception being the increased incidence in skin lesions observed in-life which was higher in males than in females. The histopathological phenotype observed following substantial DGAT1 inhibition for 6 months closely resembled that of DGAT1 knockout mice. Figure 5 shows skin photomicrographs of male wildtype and DGAT1 (-/-) mice as well as male mice treated with vehicle or 2-((1f?,4f?)- 4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid for 6 months. Effects of DGATI inhibition in the dog 2-((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid was administered to dogs, orally, once daily for 7, and twice daily for 28 or 180 days at doses predicted to cause minimal to marked DGAT1 inhibition over the dose interval. Toxicokinetic analysis revealed that Cmax was above the dog microsomal DGAT1 enzyme IC50 at all dose levels, ranging from 10x IC50 in the 4 mg/kg/day dose group in the 3 month study to 292x IC50 in the 1000 mg/kg/day dose group in the same study. For all dose levels and durations, Cmin was above the DGAT1 IC50 for the duration of the dose interval, ranging from just 1x IC50 in the 4 mg/kg/day dose group in the 3 months study to 54x IC50 in the 1000 mg/kg/day dose group in the 7 day study. Administration of 2-((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2- yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid was well tolerated in all studies. As in the mouse, drug- induced sebaceous gland atrophy in the skin was detected following histopathological examination (Figure 6) and a clear dose-response relationship was noted. Thus, group mean exposures of up to 12x FDM at Cmax and 2x at Cmin during the dose interval did not result in sebaceous gland atrophy. However, minimal sebaceous gland atrophy occurred at mean exposures of 32x FDM at Cmaxand 7x FDM at Cmin, indicating that this level of continuous DGAT1 enzyme inhibition was required for this morphological change to occur. At higher exposures, minimal to mild sebaceous gland atrophy was noted at 48-193x FDM at Cmax and 7-54x FDM at Cmin and mild to moderate sebaceous gland atrophy noted at an exposure above 165x FDM at Cmax and 36x FDM at Cmin. The relationship between FDM (Cmax and Cmin) and severity of sebaceous gland atrophy is shown in Figure 7. A clear relationship to duration of exposure and severity of sebaceous gland atrophy was also evident. Whilst sebaceous gland atrophy was absent in dogs dosed for up to 7 days, the group mean severity of this finding ranged from minimal to mild after 14 days of dosing with an increase to minimal to moderate mean severity after 3 months (90 days) of dosing and further increase to moderate level in the highest dose group after 6 months (180 days) (Figure 8). Following a 4 week drug-free period, the observed sebaceous gland atrophy noted after 3 months of dosing had resolved, indicating complete reversibility of this finding. Reversibility was not assessed following 6 months of dosing. In addition to sebaceous gland atrophy, minimal hyperkeratosis of the epithelium covering the infundibula of hair follicles was observed in the dog following exposure to 2- ((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid for 6 months. However, the additional skin changes observed after 6 months of treatment in the mouse (i.e., occasional hair follicle atrophy, as well as in-life observation of hair-loss and skin lesions) were not observed in the dog. Following administration of 2-((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2- yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid, sebaceous gland atrophy was noted at Cmax/Cmin levels of at least 22x/10x and 32x/7x FDM, but was absent at 6x/1.5x and 12x/2x times the FDM in the mouse and the dog, respectively. This is indicative of the requirement for substantial levels of DGAT1 inhibition, sustained throughout the dosing interval, for induction of sebaceous gland atrophy. Furthermore, with regard to duration of exposure in both species, inhibition of DGAT1 by 2-((1f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid for more than 7 days was required for microscopical detection of sebaceous gland atrophy, demonstrating that not only substantial, but also prolonged inhibition of DGAT1 was a key requirement. In the mouse, but not in the dog, inhibition of DGAT1 for 6 months also resulted in significant epidermal hyperplasia, occasional hair follicle atrophy, as well as in-life observation of hair-loss and skin lesions. This phenotype, which was only seen at high levels of DGAT1 inhibition, was similar to that seen in the DGAT1 (-/-) mouse that exhibit dry fur and hair-loss and which is associated with atrophic sebaceous glands and fur lipid abnormalities, especially the absence of wax esters (Chen et al. 2002; Yen et al. 2005). Fur and sebaceous gland abnormalities were most apparent in post pubertal male DGAT1 (-/-) mice, suggesting a potential hormone-based sex difference (Chen et al. 2002). Our data did not indicate a gender difference in sebaceous gland atrophy, epidermal hyperplasia or hyperkeratosis, or in-life hair loss following administration of 2-((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl- 3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2-yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid. However, the increased incidence of in-life skin lesions was more pronounced in male animals and may indicate some role of androgens in mediating the effects of DGAT1 inhibition on the skin, although it cannot be excluded that fighting, which is commonly observed in group housed males was a significant influence. These observations in the mouse suggest that DGAT1 -mediated sebum production plays an important role in the skin and in hair development and their maintenance. In the dog, we observed sebaceous gland atrophy and minimal hyperkeratosis of the epithelium only, but not the more severe phenotype which included hair loss, dry fur, and skin lesions observed in the mouse, which implies that a species difference in the role of DGAT1 in fur maintenance of the mouse and the dog may exist. Whilst pharmacological inhibition of DGAT1 in the mouse indicates a potential for alopecia, this is not supported by our data in the dog and given the differences between human and animal skin surface lipids and the role of the eccrine sweating system in man, the effects of prolonged DGAT1 inhibition on the integrity of the human skin and scalp may be less significant. Interestingly, whilst sebaceous gland, sebaceous gland duct, or hair follicle inflammation is a common finding in human asebia (Al-Zaid et al. 2011) a significant increase in inflammation was not seen in the skin of mice and dogs treated with 2-((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2- yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid. Folliculitis involving the sebaceous glands was very rare in the studies and post-inflammation scarring was not observed. This data indicates that not all species show the same degree of adverse skin changes as a consequence of DGAT1 inhibition, and that these adverse changes only occur at sustained and substantial levels of DGAT1 inhibition or in DGAT1 deficient mice. To date, no effects of 2-((1 f?,4f?)-4-(4-(6-carbamoyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazin-2- yl)phenyl)cyclohexyl)acetic acid administration on the skin of healthy volunteers have been noted in clinical trials of short duration (Denison et al. 2013). It is noteworthy that our data are also supportive of the use of pharmacological inhibition of DGAT1 in the treatment of seborrheic conditions such as acne, where a DGAT1 inhibitor-mediated atrophy of the sebaceous gland may result in a clinically relevant reduction in sebum production. 1.
