CLOSURE AND LINER COMPOSITIONS ESSENTIALLY FREE OF ETHYLENE VINYL ACETATE COPOLYMER Field of the Invention The present invention is generally related to liner resin compositions for closures, and more particularly to liner compositions which are essentially free of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer. The present invention is also related to compression molded plastic closures which include the described liner resin compositions. Background of the Invention Compression and injection molded plastic closures are widely used in the marketplace on associated containers, including both carbonated and non-carbonated beverages. Compression molded sealing liners, as well as pre-formed insertible liners, are commonly put in place in the closure after the closure has been formed. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,807,772 and 4,846,362 disclose liner compositions made of a blend of polyethylene or polypropylene and thermoplastic elastomeric copolymer. Conventional liner resin compositions typically contain significant amounts of ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,984,803 discloses a sealing liner wherein EVA comprises about 70% of the liner composition. Conventional closure liners are also described in, for instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,104,710, ΕΡ 0478109, ΕΡ 0599356, ΕΡ 0488491, and 0646158. The liners may be applied to the closure by any of the known methods, such as those described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,518,336, ΕΡ 207385, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,277,431. The disclosures of the above-mentioned patents are herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. Experience has shown that there are certain drawbacks associated with using EVA-containing liner resin compositions. For example, EVA-containing liner resin compositions have a relatively narrow processing window which can result in high levels of molding defects, such as large/balloontng bubbles, flash, non-fills and the like, Also, resins that contain EVA copolymer may limit the molding speed at which liners are molded into closures. In addition, non-EVA liner resin compositions may reduce the amount of resin needed to form a functional liner. Thus, there is a need for novel liner resin compositions without substantial amounts of EVA.

Other features and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent from the following detailed description and the appended claims. Detailed Description of the invention The disclosed embodiments are exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts disclosed herein. The present disclosure is to be considered as an exemplification of the invention, and is not intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments disclosed herein. Instead of EVA copolymers which are included in conventional liner resin compositions, the provided liner resin compositions generally include low density polyethylene (LDPE). However, a simple substitution of LDPE for EVA may not work properly, since the resin may exhibit insufficient processing and product performance 4a behavior. Further, because of the incompatibility between polypropylene and polyethylene, there may be lack of adhesion between the liner and the closure shell. A desirable low-cost workable product needs to meet some or all of the following requirements: a) low-cost components; b) adequate compatibility between the liner and the closure resin; c) adequate physical properties to have adequate product performance without the need for mineral oil as a plasticizer; and d) adequate food contact/migration and organoleptic properties. Further, because the liner resin compositions of the invention are essentially free of EVA, the overall fluidity of the liner resin needs to be significantly higher than that of the conventional EVA resins to reach the required pellet stability during molding. It has been discovered that the provided liner resin compositions meet the desired requirements. In one embodiment, the invention provides a liner resin composition comprising: a) low density polyethylene (LDPE); b) metallocene-catalyzed very low density polyethylene; c) a random copolymer; and d) a lubricant; wherein said liner composition is essentially free of EVA copolymer. As used in this application, the term “essentially free” means that the compositions may not include more than trace amounts of EVA copolymer. In a preferred embodiment, the liner resin composition further comprises a colorant. Preferably, the liner resin compositions of the invention are essentially free of mineral oil. In a preferred embodiment, LDPE has a melt flow index (MFI) (190 °C/2.16Kg) of between about 20 and about 30, and in a more preferred embodiment of between about 20 and about 25. In a preferred embodiment, LDPE has a density of between about 0.914and 0.917. Generally, for the purposes of the invention, metallocene-catalyzed very low density polyethylene is used to plasticize LDPE to reach a sufficiently low modulus to ensure proper sealing performance. Thus, metallocene-catalyzed very low density polyethylene generally needs to be high-flow and low density to blend into the high-flow LDPE, to reduce the overall modulus of the blend, and to confer some adhesion between the liner and the closure shell. In a preferred embodiment, metallocene-catalyzed very low density polyethylene has the MFI (190 °C/2.16Kg) of about 30. In a preferred embodiment, metallocene-catalyzed very low density polyethylene has density of between about 0.880 and 0.885.

Each of them can be used alone or in a combination. In a preferred embodiment, the random copolymer is a random polypropylene copolymer. Preferably, the random polypropylene copolymer has a MFI (230 °C/2.16Kg) of between about 40 and about 45, and a density of between about 0.900 and 0.905.

In a more preferred embodiment, the invention provides a liner resin composition comprising between about 10% and about 20% of metallocene-catalyzed very low density polyethylene; between about 5% and about 10% of a random polypropylene copolymer; about 1% of erucamide; a colorant in an amount sufficient to achieve the desired color of the liner resin composition; and between about 60% and 70% of LDPE to bring the total percentage to 100%, wherein the amounts are based on the total weight of the liner resin composition.
