BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a derivative plant promoter inducible by abiotic stress, and host cells and transgenic plants transformed with the abiotic stress-inducible promoter. Abiotic stresses include drought, salinity and extreme temperatures. These stresses, particularly drought, cause extensive losses to agricultural crop production. The ability of crop plants to tolerate drought conditions would be beneficial in reducing these losses. A plant promoter inducible under abiotic stress conditions is described in PCT/IB2008/054628 (published as WO2009/060402), the contents of which are incorporated by reference. On the whole, in comparison to the high level transgene expression by constitutive promoters, stress-inducible promoters provide poor expression levels of genes in transgenic plants. On the other hand, the stress-inducible promoter, XvPSap1, isolated from the genome of a desiccation tolerant monocotyledonous plant, Xerophyta viscosa, was found to express efficiently. However, the XvPSap1, promoter has a disadvantage in that the sequence is relatively large. The large promoter size is a limiting factor for its use in the development of transgenic plants, as the longer the transgenic DNA sequence, the lower the efficiency of transformation and stability of the trait. As such, this will greatly limit the use of XvPSap1 in biotechnological applications. A need therefore exists for an abiotic stress-inducible promoter that can be used to transform crop plants and which has a shorter length than XvPSap1, but is still able to function at least as well as XvPSap1. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to a first embodiment of the invention, there is provided an isolated derivative plant promoter nucleotide sequence from Xerophyta viscosa which functions as a plant promoter inducible by abiotic stress. The nucleotide sequence may be derived from Xerophyta viscosa XvPSap1 or may be artificially synthesised. The derivative promoter fragment nucleotide sequence may comprise any one or more of the regulatory elements identified as: TC-rich repeats , ; MYB transcription factor binding site ; or ABA-responsive elements , , , as illustrated in FIG. 15. The nucleotide sequence may be: (a) a nucleic acid sequence that exhibits at least 80% sequence identity to any one of SEQ ID NO:1 to 3 (FIGS. 1 to 3); or(b) a sequence which hybridises under stringent conditions to the reverse complement of any one of SEQ ID NO:1 to 3 (FIGS. 4 to 6); or(c) a nucleic acid sequence of any one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-3. Preferably, the derivative promoter functions as an abiotic stress inducible promoter. More preferably, the nucleotide sequence may have at least 85%, 90%, or 95% identity to any one of SEQ ID NO:1 to 3 (FIGS. 1 to 3). Even more preferably, the nucleotide sequence may be any one of SEQ ID NO:1 to 3 (FIGS. 1 to 3) or a sequence which hybridises under stringent conditions to the reverse complement of any one of SEQ ID NO:1 to 3 (FIGS. 4 to 6) and functions as an abiotic stress inducible promoter. The abiotic stress may be osmotic stress, dehydration stress, drought, salinity, desiccation or extreme temperatures. Hybridisation may occur under stringent conditions that include a wash in 0.1 SSC at about 60° C. to about 65° C. According to a further embodiment of the invention, there is provided a nucleotide cassette comprising the promoter fragment of the invention. According to a further embodiment of the invention, there is provided a recombinant plant vector comprising the promoter fragment of the invention. The nucleotide cassette or plant vector may further comprise a heterologous transcribable DNA sequence. According to one embodiment of the invention the heterologous transcribable DNA sequence, operably linked to the promoter, may be a gene enconding a polypeptide of interest. For example, the gene may be an abiotic stress tolerance gene which when expressed by the promoter in a plant provides tolerance to an abiotic stress. More preferably, the gene may be XvSap1, XvPrx2, Xvper1, XvAld or any other gene providing tolerance to an abiotic stress known to those skilled in the art. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the gene is any gene desired to be inducibly expressed in a plant by an abiotic stress. The gene may be a plant gene or a foreign gene, such as an animal, bacterial, fungal or viral gene. In yet another embodiment of the invention the heterologous transcribable DNA sequence includes a polynucleotide sequence of interest which is transcribed into a functional RNA, such as a shRNA, miRNA, siRNA, mRNA or the like. The recombinant plant vector may be a T-derived plasmid construct of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. According to a further embodiment of the invention, there is provided a host cell into which the nucleotide cassette or plant vector has been transformed. The host cell may be a plant cell. According to a further embodiment of the invention, there is provided a transgenic plant or plant part transformed with the minimal plant promoter fragment of the invention and a gene operably linked to the minimal plant promoter fragment of the invention. For example, the gene may be an abiotic stress tolerance gene which when expressed in the transgenic plant or plant part provides tolerance to an abiotic stress. More preferably, the gene may be XvSap1, XvPrx2, XvPer1, XvAld or any other gene providing tolerance to an abiotic stress known to those skilled in the art. In an alternative embodiment of the invention, the gene is any gene desired to be inducibly expressed in the transgenic plant or plant part by an abiotic stress. The gene may be a plant gene, including a plant gene suitable for providing tolerance to an abiotic stress known to those skilled in the art, including, but not limited to, XvSap1, XvPrx2, XvPer1 or XvAld, or the gene may be a foreign gene, such as an animal, bacterial, fungal or viral gene. The transgenic plant may be a monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous plant, such as maize, tobacco, sorghum, wheat, cassava, barley, oats, rye, sweet potatoes, soybean, alfalfa, tobacco, sunflower, cotton, canola and the like. The transgenic plant part may be selected from the group consisting of: cells, protoplasts, cell tissue cultures, callus, cell crumps, embryos, pollen, ovules, seeds, flowers, kernels, ears, cobs, leaves, husks, stalks, roots, root tips, anthers, seeds and silk. According to a further embodiment of the invention, there is provided a method for enhancing the stress tolerance of a plant by introducing the minimal promoter fragment of the invention operably linked to an abiotic stress tolerance gene under control of the promoter which, when expressed in a transgenic plant or plant part, provides tolerance to an abiotic stress. For example, the gene may be XvSap1, XvPrx2, Xvper1, XvAld or any other gene providing tolerance to an abiotic stress known to those skilled in the art. In yet another embodiment of the invention, there is provided for methods of regulation of transcription of heterologous transcribable DNA sequences either in a host cell or a transgenic plant. A futher embodiment incorporates producing a transgenic plant by transforming a plant cell with a nucleotide cassette as described herein and regenerating a plant from the transformed cell.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying figures, in which some, but not all embodiments of the invention are shown. The invention as described should not to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed and modifications and other embodiments are intended to be included within the scope of the invention. Although specific terms are employed herein, they are used in a generic and descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation. Terms used herein have their ordinary meaning recognised in the art unless otherwise indicated. The present invention provides for polynucleotides having gene regulatory activity and which are derived from the XvPSap1 (SEQ ID NO:9) promoter of the monocotyledenous plant Xerophyta viscosa. The derivative promoter fragments of the invention display regulatory activity and are inducible by abiotic stress. The present invention also relates to host cells and transgenic plants transformed with the abiotic stress-inducible promoter fragments. In comparison to the high level transgene expression by constitutive promoters, stress-inducible promoters result in relatively low expression levels in transgenic plants. For example, the XvPSap1 abiotic stress-inducible promoter has efficient expression levels, but due to the large size of the promoter, its use is problematic in the development of transgenic plants. Previous attempts to improve on the XvPSap1 promoter and generate shorter promoter fragments which are functionally active were focussed on producing 5′ truncated promoter fragments to regulate expression of the reporter genes in tobacco and Black Mexican Sweetcorn (BMS) cells under dehydration. These 5′ promoter fragments displayed significantly lower levels of expression than the full length XVPsap1 promoter (Oduor et al., 2009). Due to their attenuated functionality, 5′ promoter fragments of the XvPSap1 promoter have limited commercial use and/or biological functionality. Surprisingly, however, when mutagenesis studies producing internal deletions within the XvPSap1 promoter to produce the derivative promoter fragments of the invention, three of the four derivative promoter fragments, herein designated, XvPSap1D (SEQ ID NO:1), XvPSap1E (SEQ ID NO:2), and XvPSap1G (SEQ ID NO:3) (FIGS. 1 to 3), elicited high levels of gene expression, at least equivalent to the full-length XvPSap1 promoter, without adversely affecting plant growth. The derivative promoter fragments of the present invention are approximately 50% shorter than the full length XvPSap1 promoter and share only 40 to 50% sequence identity with the full length promoter. The three promoter fragments share 83% sequence identity with each other. Therefore, it is envisaged that nucleotide sequences within 83% of any of the XvPSap1D, XvPSap1E, and XvPSap1G promoter fragment sequences would be functional and elicit high level gene expression. As used herein, “percent (%) sequence identity” with respect to the XvPSap1D, XvPSap1E and XvPSap1G sequences is defined as the percentage of nucleotides in a candidate sequence that are identical to the nucleotides in the sequences of XvPSap1D, XvPSap1E or XvPSap1G, respectively, after aligning the sequences and introducing gaps, if necessary, to achieve a maximum percent sequence identity. Alignment for purposes of determining percent sequence identity can be achieved in various ways that are within the knowledge of those with skill in the art. These ways may include, for instance, using computer software such as ALIGN, Megalign (DNASTAR), CLUSTALW or BLAST software. Those skilled in the art can determine appropriate parameters for measuring alignment, including any algorithms needed to achieve maximal alignment over the full length of the sequences being compared. In one embodiment of the invention there is provided for a polynucleotide sequence that has at least about 80% sequence identity, at least about 90% sequence identity, or even greater sequence identity, such as about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98% or about 99% sequence identity to the derivative promoter sequences, being XvPSap1D, XvPSap1E or XvPSap1G, described herein. Accordingly, polynucleotide sequences that are capable of regulating the transcription of an operably linked polynucleotide sequence and which have a greater than 80% sequence identity to the XvPSap1D, XvPSap1E and XvPSap1D polynucleotide sequences of the invention, are encompassed within the scope of this invention. The invention also encompasses polynucleotide sequences capable of hybridising to a reverse complementary sequence of any of the XvPSap1D, XvPSap1E, and XvPSap1G derivative promoter fragment sequences under stringent conditions (FIGS. 4 to 6). The “stringency” of a hybridisation reaction is readily determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art, and generally is an empirical calculation which depends upon probe length, washing temperature, and salt concentration. In general, longer probes required higher temperatures for proper annealing, while shorter probes require lower temperatures. Hybridisation generally depends on the ability of denatured DNA to re-anneal when complementary strands are present in an environment below their melting temperature. A typical example of such “stringent” hybridisation conditions would be hybridisation carried out for 18 hours at 65° C. with gentle shaking, a first wash for 12 min at 65° C. in Wash Buffer A (0.5% SDS; 2×SSC), and a second wash for 10 min at 65° C. in Wash Buffer B (0.1% SDS; 0.5% SSC). The XvPSap1D, XvPSap1E, and XvPSap1G promoter fragments are inserted upstream of an operably linked heterologous transcribable DNA sequence and this construct is cloned into a vector. It will be appreciated that the promoter fragment and the heterologous transcribable DNA sequence may be sequentially cloned into the vector. In this conformation the promoter fragments are operably linked to the relevant heterologous transcribable DNA sequence and may inducibly regulate the transcription of the heterologous transcribable DNA sequence. It will be readily apparent to those of skill in the art what the requirements are for a vector for use in the transformation of plants. Those of skill in the art will also appreciate that certain components may also be introduced into the vector including, but not limited to, 3′ untranslated regions, such as terminators; 5′ untranslated regions, such as regulatory elements; enhancers; introns; signal peptides; transit peptides; and other components. The vector may then then be introduced into a plant using any of the methods of plant transformation known to those of skill in the art in order to produce a transgenic plant. A “transgenic plant” refers to a plant or its progeny, wherein the DNA of the plant contains an exogenous DNA fragment which has been stably introduced into the plant and wherein the exogenous DNA is heritable. The heterologous transcribable DNA sequences which are under the control of the derivative promoter fragments of the invention may include polynucleotide sequences encoding polypeptides or polynucleotide sequences which are translated into functional RNAs. Heterologous transcribable DNA sequences encoding polypeptides of interest which may be inducibly expressed under control of the derivative plant promoters include, but are not limited to, genes that confer desirable characteristics to the transformed plant and/or genes which encode polypeptides of economic importance. Preferably the transgenes under the control of the promoter fragments of the invention may encode polypeptides, including but not limited to: abiotic stress tolerance proteins; antibodies; biofuels; biopolymers; industrial enzymes; pharmaceutical polypeptides; proteins which affect the ripening of fruit, proteins which provide improved nutritional content, including proteins affecting the yields of for instance fatty acids, oils, proteins and/or starches; proteins affecting resistance, including for instance bacterial resistance proteins, fungal resistance proteins, herbicide resistance proteins, insect resistance proteins, nematode resistance proteins, or viral resistance proteins. Alternatively, the heterologous transcribable DNA sequence may be translated into an RNA molecule such as a regulatory RNA, including for instance a miRNA, siRNA, antisense RNA or the like. Upon subjecting the transgenic plant to an abiotic stress, including drought, salinity, temperature stress, dessication, osmotic stress or dessicataion the heterologous transcribable DNA sequence is expressed under the control of the derivative promoter fragment. It is envisioned that any polynucleotide sequence that encodes a polypeptide or mRNA that expresses a phenotype or change in morphology may be useful in the practice of the present invention. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, there is provided for the production of transgenic plants tolerant to abiotic stresses, such transgenic plants include transgenes under the control of the inducible promoter fragments of the invention such as XvSap1, XvPrx2, XyPer1, or XvAld (Garwe et al., 2003, Garwe et al., 2007, Iyer et al., 2007 and Bhatnagar-Mathur et al., 2008), the aforementioned genes are examples of genes encoding polypeptides that confer abiotic stress tolerance to plants. In the present invention the inventors have shown that transformation of a dicot with the derivative promoter fragments of the invention results in the transcription of heterologous transcribable DNA sequence which is operably linked to and under the control of the promoter. It is however expected that as the derivative promoter fragments were isolated from a monocot plant, Xerophyta viscosa that they will perform as well, if not better, in a monocot plant. The construct comprising a derivative promoter fragment of the invention and the heterologous transcribable DNA sequence of interest could be used to transform The present invention is further described by the following examples. These examples, however, are not to be construed as limiting in any way either the spirit or scope of the invention. EXAMPLE 1 Mutagenesis of XvPSap1 Internal deletions were performed on the XvPSap1 (SEQ ID NO:9) promoter in the recombinant pBluescript::XvPSap1 plasmid to generate four shortened promoter fragments designated XvPSap1D (SEQ ID NO:1), XvPSap1E (SEQ ID NO:2), XvPSap1F (SEQ ID NO:7) and XvPSap1G (SEQ ID NO:3). Two forward primers (Primer A (SEQ ID NO:12) and Primer B (SEQ ID NO:13)) and two reverse primers (Primer C (SEQ ID NO:14) and Primer D (SEQ ID NO:15)) were designed (Table 1). Primers A and B bind to the 3′-end of XvPSap1 for amplification of 378 bp and 575 bp fragments of the XvPSap1 promoter, respectively (FIG. 10A). Similarly, primers C and D bind to the 5′-end of XvPSap1 for amplification of 546 bp and 358 bp fragments of the XvPSap1 promoter, respectively (FIG. 10A). The mutagenesis strategy involved the use of combinations of the respective forward and reverse primers to generate the four putative promoters in linearised pBluescript vector (FIG. 10B). Primer set B and C generated the XvPSap1D promoter fragment, B and D generated the XvPSap1E promoter fragment, A and C generated the XvPSap1F promoter fragment and A and D generated the XvPSap1G promoter fragment.

A high fidelity polymerase (Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase, Thermo Scientific), which has proofreading activity was used. Amplification was carried out with the following conditions: 94° C. for 5 min; 5 cycles of 94° C. for 30 s, 52° C. for 45 s, 68° C. for 1 min; followed by 25 cycles of 94° C. for 30 s, 56° C. for 45 s, 68° C. for 1 min; and a final extension of 68° C. for 10 min. The PCR reaction was performed using a GeneAmp 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). The generated PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% EtBr stained agarose gel. The bands of interest were excised and purified using the Wizard SV Gel Purification Kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions The linearised pBluescript DNA was treated with Klenow Fragment exo-(Fermentas), according to the manufacturer's instructions, to facilitate blunt end cloning. Standard blunt end ligation reactions of the linearised pBluescript DNA containing the XvPSap1D, E, F and G promoter fragments were set up as follows: linearised vector was religated in a total reaction volume of 20 μl, each ligation reaction contained 10 U of T4 DNA ligase and Ligase Buffer (New England Biolabs, USA) at a final concentration of 1×, the ligation reaction was mixed gently, briefly centrifuged and then incubated for 16 hours at 4° C. The recombinant pBluescript plasmids (pBluescript::XvPSap1D, E, F and G) were transformed into competent E. coli DH5α cells. Competent cells were allowed to thaw on ice. Thereafter, 10 μl of ligation mix was added to a 100 μl aliquot of competent cells and mixed gently. This transformation mix was incubated for 10 min on ice and then heat shocked by incubation for 5 min at 37° C. followed immediately by incubation for 2 min on ice. Eight hundred microliters of LB broth was added to the transformed cells and incubated for 1 h at 37° C. with vigorous shaking. One hundred microliters of the transformation mix was plated on LB agar plates supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and incubated for 16 h at 37° C. Colony PCR was performed to identify transformed clones using promoter specific primers (EcoRI-XvPsap1-F 5′-GGAATTCACTGTCTGGTAGCTGG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 16) and (BamHI-XvPSap1-R 5′-TCCGGATCCTCCCTAATATCTCTCGCTC-3′ (SEQ ID NO:17)). A 25 μl PCR amplification reaction was set up as follows: 1× standard buffer, 0.4 μM of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTP mixture, 0.04 U/μl Taq polymerase, 5 ng/ul template DNA made up to the final volume with dH20. A thermostable DNA polymerase, Supertherm Polymerase (Bertec Enterprise) was used for amplification. Amplification was carried out with the following conditions: 94° C. for 5 min; 30 cycles of 94° C. for 30 s, 59° C. for 45 s, 72° C. for 1 min; and a final extension of 72° C. for 10 min. Colonies that were observed to be positive by colony PCR screening were inoculated into 5 ml LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated for 16 h at 37° C. with shaking. For each construct, plasmid DNA from 3 different clones was isolated using the Bioflux Plasmid DNA Extraction and Purification Kit (Bioer) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified plasmid DNA was stored at −20° C. Plasmid DNA was sequenced and based on the sequence data, one recombinant plasmid for each promoter construct was selected for further downstream analysis. The pBluescript::promoter fragments were successfully amplified, however non-specific amplification was also observed evidenced by the higher and lower molecular weight bands (FIG. 11). An intense band, corresponding to a fragment of approximately 4 kb, was observed in lanes 1 and 2. This band corresponds to the expected size of the linear pBluescript::XvPSap1D, E, F and G promoter fragments (FIGS. 11A, B, C and D, respectively). As a negative control, control PCR reaction without template was included. No amplification was observed in this control reaction. The amplified DNA fragments were successfully excised, purified and treated with Klenow polymerase to facilitate blunt end ligation. Ligation mixtures were transformed into competent E. coli DH5α cells. Fifteen colonies each for pBluescript::XvPSap1D, E, F and G constructs were selected for screening. All of the selected colonies contained the desired promoter fragment. Three colonies for each promoter fragment were selected for further analysis. Sequencing results confirmed that the four shortened promoter fragments had been successfully ligated in pBluescript. EXAMPLE 2 Generation of pBluescript::Promoter Fragment::luc::NosT Endonuclease digestion of the pBluescript vector containing the promoter fragments with EcoRI and BamHI allowed for cleavage of the promoter constructs from the pBluescript plasmid. Similarly, EcoRI and BamHI double digestion of pBluescript::XvPSap1::luc::NosT (FIG. 12) allowed for removal of the original XvPSap1 promoter, resulting in linearised pBluescript::luc::NosT with EcoRI and BamHI overhangs. Three micrograms of each recombinant pBluescript plasmid was digested in a total volume of 60 μl using EcoRI and BamHI (FastDigest, Fermentas). The reaction mixture contained 6 μl of 10× FastDigest buffer, 3 units FastDigest EcoRI and 3 units FastDigest BamHI. Similarly, 4 μg of pBluescript::XvPSap1::luc::NosT was digested in a total volume of 80 μl using EcoRI and BamHI (FastDigest, Fermentas). The reaction mixture contained 8 μl of 10× FastDigest buffer, 4 units FastDigest EcoRI and 4 units FastDigest BamHI. The digestion mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37° C. Digested products were electrophoresed on a 1% EtBr stained agarose gel and the desired digestion products excised and purified using the Wizard SV Gel Purification Kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Site specific cohesive end ligation reactions were set up as follows: purified DNA fragments (insert DNA) were ligated to linearised vector in a reaction volume of 20 μl. Each ligation reaction contained 10 U of T4 DNA ligase and Ligase Buffer (New England Biolabs, USA) at a final concentration of 1×. The ligation reaction was mixed gently, briefly centrifuged and then incubated for 16 hours at 4° C. The recombinant pBluescript plasmids (pBluescript::XvPSap1D, E, F, G::luc::NosT) were transformed into competent E. coli DH5α cells according to the protocol described in Example 1. The transformed cells were plated on LB agar supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated for 16 h at 37° C. Colony PCR was performed to identify positively transformed clones using promoter specific primers (EcoRI-XvPSap1-F (SEQ ID NO:16) and (BamHI-XvPSap1-R (SEQ ID NO:17)). For each amplification, 25 μl reaction volumes were set up as follows: 1× standard buffer, 0.4 μM of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTP mixture, 0.04 U/μl Taq polymerase, 5 ng/ul template DNA made up to the final volume with dH20. Amplification was carried out according to the protocol described in Example 1. Positive clones were inoculated into 5 ml LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and incubated for 16 h at 37° C. with shaking. For each recombinant plasmid, 3 different clones were isolated using the Bioflux Plasmid DNA extraction and Purification Kit (Bioer) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Recombinant plasmid DNA was assessed by endonuclease digestion. Five hundred nanograms of recombinant plasmid DNA was digested in a total volume of 20 μl using EcoRI and BamHI (FastDigest, Fermentas). The reaction mixture contained 2 μl of 10× FastDigest buffer, 1 unit FastDigest EcoRI and 1 unit FastDigest BamHI. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37° C. Thereafter, digested products were electrophoresed on a 1% EtBr stained agarose gel. One recombinant plasmid for each promoter construct was selected for further downstream analysis. Undigested plasmid DNA was stored at −20° C. To facilitate later qualitative and quantitative analyses, the shortened promoters were individually cloned upstream of luc and NosT. To do this, the individual pBluescript vectors containing the shortened promoters, XvPSap1D, E, F and G were successfully digested with EcoRI and BamHI to release the respective promoter fragments. Single linear bands of 1.103 kb, 0.913 kb, 0.903 kb and 0.713 kb corresponding to the size of XvPSap1D, E, F and G, respectively, were observed following electrophoresis of the digestion products. Similarly, EcoRI and BamHI double digestion of pBluescript::XvPSap1::/luc::NosT was successful in removing the original XvPSap1 promoter, resulting in linearised pBluescript::luc::NosT with EcoRI and BamHI overhangs. A single band of approximately 5 kb, corresponding to the expected size of pBluescript::luc::NosT was observed when digestion products were electrophoresed. The XvPSap1 promoter fragments of interest were successfully excised, purified and cohesive end ligation reactions were set up. Ligation mixtures were successfully transformed into competent E. coli DH5α cells. Fifteen colonies for each construct were selected for screening. In each instance fourteen or fifteen colonies contained XvPSap1D, E, F or G. EXAMPLE 3 Generation of Binary Vector Constructs Digestion of pBluescript::promoter_fragment::luc::NosT constructs with EcoRI and HindIII allowed for cleavage of each shortened promoter cassette from the recombinant plasmid. Similarly, the EcoRI and HindIII restriction double digestion of pTF101.1 (SEQ ID NO:29) resulted in linearised pTF101.1 with cohesive EcoRI and HindIII overhangs. pTF101.1 is a binary vector used in plant transformation protocols. Initially, 3 μg of each recombinant plasmid was digested in a total volume of 20 μl using PvuII (Fermentas). The reaction mixture, containing 2 μl of 10× Buffer G and 1 unit PvuII, was incubated for 1 h at 37° C. The PvuII digest was necessary to differentiate between the promoter cassettes and the pBluescript vector due to their similar size (approximately 3 kb). PvuII cleaves pBluescript to yield two fragments of approximately 2.4 kb and a single 0.5 kb fragment. PvuII does not cleave the promoter constructs. Thus, it was possible to distinguish between pBluescript and the promoter cassettes. Digested products were electrophoresed on a 1% EtBr stained agarose gel and purified using the EZ-10 Spin Column PCR Purification Kit (Bio Basic Inc) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The PvuII digested purified promoter cassettes were digested in a total volume of 50 μl using EcoRI and HindIII (FastDigest, Fermentas). The reaction mixture contained 5 μl of 10× FastDigest buffer, 3 units FastDigest EcoRI and 3 units FastDigest HindIII. The digestion mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37° C. Similarly, 3 μg of pTF101.1 was digested using EcoRI and HindIII. Digested products were electrophoresed on a 1% EtBr stained agarose gel and the desired digestion products excised and purified using the Wizard SV Gel Purification Kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Site specific cohesive end ligation reactions were set up as described in Example 2 for a vector to insert ratio of 1:3 using 50 ng of vector. Reaction components were mixed well and incubated for 16 h at 4° C. Recombinant pTF101.1::promoter_fragment::luc::NosT was transformed into competent E. coli DH5α cells according to the protocol described in Example 1. The transformed cells were plated on LB agar supplemented with 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated for 16 h at 37° C. Colony PCR was performed to identify positively transformed clones using promoter specific primers (EcoRI-XvPSap1-F (SEQ ID NO:16) and BamHI-XvPSap1-R (SEQ ID NO:17)). For each amplification, 25 μl reaction volumes were set up with component concentrations and colony PCR amplification conditions as described in Example 1. Colonies observed to be positive by colony PCR screening were inoculated into 5 ml LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml streptomycin and incubated for 16 h at 37° C. with shaking. For each construct, plasmid DNA from 3 different clones was isolated using the Bioflux Plasmid DNA Extraction and Purification Kit (Bioer) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The isolated recombinant plasmid DNA was assessed by endonuclease digestion. Five hundred nanograms of recombinant plasmid DNA was digested in a total volume of 20 μl using EcoRI and HindIII (FastDigest, Fermentas). The reaction mixture contained 2 μl of 10× FastDigest buffer, 1 unit FastDigest EcoRI and 1 unit FastDigest HindIII. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37° C. Thereafter, digested products were electrophoresed on a 1% EtBr stained agarose gel. One recombinant plasmid for each promoter construct was selected for further downstream analysis. Undigested plasmid DNA was stored at −20° C. Three colonies for each of the promoter constructs were selected for plasmid isolation and restriction endonuclease analysis. Each isolated plasmid was subjected to EcoRI and HindIII digestion and thereafter electrophoresed. For all samples, a band of approximately 3 kb was observed (FIG. 13). This was expected as both the vector backbone and promoter::luc::NosT constructs are approximately 3 kb. An EcoRI and BamHI restriction endonuclease reaction was also performed to differentiate between the pBluescript vector and the promoter::luc::NosT cassettes. In this instance, two distinct DNA fragments corresponding to the promoter and the pBluescript::luc::NosT fragments were expected. Following digestion, two distinct bands were observed (FIG. 13). The larger approximately 5 kb fragment corresponded to the size of pBluescript::luc::NosT whereas the smaller fragments corresponded to the sizes of the various promoter fragments. To facilitate plant transformation, the promoter::luc::NosT constructs were cloned into pTF101.1. The pTF101.1 vector is a binary vector containing the necessary DNA sequences for integration of transgenes into the plant genomic DNA. To differentiate between the pBluescript backbone and promoter_fragment::luc::NosT fragments generated by EcoRI and HindIII digestion, a PvuII digest of the four cloned constructs was successfully performed. The PvuII endonuclease cleaves pBluescript to yield two fragments of approximately 2.4 kb and 0.5 kb. It does not cleave the promoter cassettes of approximately 3 kb. The digestion products were purified and subjected to EcoRI and HindIII digestion. This allowed for cleavage of the promoter cassettes from pBluescript. Electrophoresis of the triple digested DNA revealed the presence of three fragments of the expected size. These were the 0.5 kb and 2.4 kb fragments corresponding to the digested pBluescript vector and a fragment of approximately 3 kb corresponding to the promoter cassettes. The EcoRI and HindIII double digestion of pTF101.1 was successful and resulted in linearised pTF101.1 with EcoRI and HindIII overhangs situated within the T-DNA region. The DNA fragments corresponding to the pTF101.1 vector and promoter cassettes were successfully excised and purified. Specific cohesive end ligation reactions were set up and used to successfully transform competent E. coli DH5α cells. Ten colonies for each construct were selected for screening. Six colonies contained XvPSap1D, nine contained XvPSap1E, eight contained XvPSap1F and seven contained XvPSap1G. Two colonies for each promoter were selected for plasmid isolation and EcoRI and HindIII restriction endonuclease analysis (FIG. 14). The digested pTF101.1::promoter_fragment::luc::NosT generated linear bands of approximately 3 kb and 9 kb for each construct. The smaller DNA fragment was the expected size for the promoter_fragment::luc::NosT cassette and the larger fragment corresponded to the size of the pTF101.1 vector. Both the PCR analysis as well as digestion results indicated that each promoter_fragment::luc::NosT cassette had been successfully cloned into the pTF101.1 binary vector. EXAMPLE 4 In silico Analysis of Promoter Sequences Following sequencing of the promoter fragments, the sequences were assessed for the presence of core and regulatory elements using the plantCARE software (Lescot et al., 2002). In silico sequence analysis demonstrated that none of the promoter fragments used in this study displayed any significant sequence homology to any other known plant promoters except to XvPSap1. The shortened XvPSap1 promoters shared 82.57% sequence homology with each other. The promoter core and cis-acting regulatory elements were predicted by the plantCARE bioinformatics tool. Four identical TATA-boxes were predicted in each promoter fragment within the 5′-300 bp region. Various cis-acting elements were tentatively identified. These included elements involved in drought-, light- and low temperature-inducibility as well as in defense and biotic stress responsiveness. Cis-acting elements involved in abscisic acid, salicyclic acid and gibberellin responsiveness were observed. Additionally, elements involved in meristem expression, auxin-responsiveness and circadian control were also noted. Putative core and regulatory elements, including TC-rich repeats, MYB transcription factor binding site and ABA-response elements identified are indicated in FIG. 15. EXAMPLE 5 Transformation and Screening of Agrobacterium tumefaciens The four pTF101.1 recombinant plasmids containing XvPSap1D::luc::NosT, XvPSap1E::luc::NosT, XvPSap1F::luc::NosT and XvPSap1G::luc::NosT were transformed into competent A. tumefaciens EHA101 cells. The transformation was carried according to the protocol described in Example 1 with two modifications. Firstly, transformed A. tumefaciens cells were incubated for 6 h at 30° C. instead of 1 hr at 37° C. Secondly, selection of transformed cells was performed on YEP agar supplemented with 100 μg/ml spectinomycin, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Colony PCR was performed to identify positively transformed clones using promoter specific primers (EcoRI-XvPSap1-F (SEQ ID NO:16) and BamHI-XvPSap1-R (SEQ ID NO:17)). For each amplification, 25 μl reaction volumes were set up as described in Example 1. Amplification was carried according to the protocol described in Example 1. Colonies observed to be positive by colony PCR screening were inoculated into 10 ml YEP Broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml spectinomycin, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml kanamycin and incubated for 16 h at 30° C. with shaking. For each construct, plasmid DNA from 3 different clones was isolated using the Bioflux Plasmid DNA Extraction and Purification kit (Bioer) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The isolated recombinant PTF101.1 plasmid DNA was verified to contain the entire promoter cassette by endonuclease digestions with EcoRI and HindIII. Digestion reactions were carried out according to the protocol described in Example 3. One recombinant plasmid for each promoter construct was selected for further downstream analysis. Glycerol stocks were synthesised by adding 200 μl of cells to 800 μl of autoclaved 50% glycerol, the mixture was gently mixed and stored at −80° C. The pTF101.1 constructs were successfully transformed into competent Agrobacterium EHA101 cells. Fifteen colonies for each pTF101.1 construct were selected for screening and each contained the relevant promoter fragment. Five colonies for each of the pTF101::promoter_fragment::luc::NosT constructs were selected for further analysis. The presence of the pTF101.1 constructs in EHA101 was successfully verified by EcoRI and HindIII digestion. EXAMPLE 6 Agrobacterium-Mediated Transformation of Nicotiana tabacum with pTF101.1 Vector Constructs Fifty microliters of wild type N. tabacum (SR1 ecotype) seed was transferred to a sterile 2 ml Eppendorf. Seeds were sterilised in a solution containing 1 ml of 20% JIK supplemented with 0.1% Tween20, the mixture was briefly vortexed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The mixture was centrifuged for 30 s at 16000×g and the JIK solution removed. The sterilised seeds were washed in 1 ml sterile water, vortexed for 30 sec and centrifuged for 1 min at 16000×g. The water was removed and the washes repeated 4 times. The sterilised seeds were dried between sterile filter paper and collected in a sterile 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Sterilised seeds were subsequently germinated on sterile potting soil mix. Plants were cultured in the growth room with set conditions (24° C.; 16 h light, 8 h dark). Plants were maintained at these conditions for 2 to 3 months and watered twice weekly. Plants were treated with 1.14 g/l phostrogen every second week. Single colonies of the transformed A. tumefaciens carrying the individual XvPSap1 promoter fragment expression cassettes were inoculated into 10 ml of YEP media supplemented with 100 μg/ml spectinomycin, 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μg/ml kanamycin. The cultures were incubated for 16 h at 30° C. One ml of the 16 h culture was inoculated into 200 ml of YEP media supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics. The cultures were incubated at 30° C. until an absorbance reading of approximately 0.8 at 600 nm was obtained. The cultures were centrifuged for 20 min at 6000×g at 4° C. The supernatant was discarded and the bacterial pellets resuspended in 50 ml of liquid co-cultivation media comprising MS basal salts supplemented with B5 vitamin solution, 30 g/l sucrose, 0.1 mg/l α-naphthaleneacetic acid, 1 mg/l 6-benzylamino purine and 100 μM/l acetosyringone. The pH was adjusted to 5.4 with 1 M KOH. Four to six inch leaves were selected from 2 month old plants. Leaves were soaked in sterile water for 30 min and sterilised according to the protocol described above. Sterile leaves were sliced into uniform segments of 5 mm avoiding the leaf margins and mid vein. Leaf explants were placed adaxial side up onto pre-culture media. Pre-culture was comprised of MS basal salts supplemented with B5 vitamin solution, 30 g/l sucrose, 0.1 mg/l α-naphthaleneacetic acid, 1 mg/l 6-benzylamino purine, 100 μM/l acetosyringone and 8 g/l plant agar. The pH was adjusted to 5.7 with 1 M KOH. Leaf disks were infected for 30 min in the dark with the Agrobacterium inoculum containing the promoter cassettes in sterile petri dishes. The petri dishes were agitated once every 10 min. Thereafter, infected leaf disks were blot dried on sterile filter paper. Negative controls infected with A. tumefaciens containing pTF101.1 vector only were also included. Each infected explant was transferred to co-cultivation medium and incubated for 3 days at 23° C. (18 h light, 6 h dark; light intensity of 140 μmol/m2/s). The adaxial part of the leaf was kept in contact with the medium. The co-cultivation media comprised MS basal salts supplemented with B5 vitamin solution, 30 g/l sucrose, 0.1 mg/l α-naphthaleneacetic acid, 1 mg/l 6-benzylamino purine and 100 μM/l acetosyringone. The pH was adjusted to 5.4. Following the 3 day co-cultivation period, leaf discs were selected on shooting medium comprising MS basal salts supplemented with B5 vitamin solution, 30 g/l sucrose, 0.1 mg/l α-naphthaleneacetic acid, 1 mg/l 6-benzylamino purine, 10 μg/l nyastatin, 250 mg/l carbenicillin and 3 mg/l BASTA. Leaf explants were placed under an 18 h light regime with light intensity of 140 μmol/m2/s at 28° C. Putative transformants were subcultured fortnightly onto fresh media until sizable shoots were formed. BASTA resistant shoots were selected, excised and transferred to rooting media. The rooting media comprised half strength hormone free MS basal salts supplemented with 10 mg/l sucrose, 10 μg/l nyastatin, 250 mg/l carbenicillin and 3 mg/l BASTA. Putative transformants with well-established root systems were transferred to pots containing sterile potting soil and cultured with set conditions according to the following conditions 24° C.; 16 h light, 8 h dark. The plants were covered with saran wrap for 8 days to assist acclimatisation and minimise dehydration. Once acclimatised, the putative transformants were transferred to 6 inch pots containing potting soil under normal growth conditions. Mature plants were self-pollinated and seed was harvested from mature dry pods. The transformation efficiency (TE) was calculated according to the formula: [in-line-formulae]TE=((no. of positive transformants)/(no. of explants transformed))×100.[/in-line-formulae] Putative transgenic tobacco seed was sterilised according to the protocol described above and germinated on MS media supplemented with 8 g/l agar and 3 mg/ml BASTA. The pH was adjusted to 5.7 with 1 M KOH. Plants were cultured in the growth room with set conditions (24° C.; 16 h day, 8 h night). The surviving BASTA resistant plants with well-established root systems were transferred to trays containing 0.1 g/l Gaucho SW treated potting soil and covered with saran wrap for 1 week. Three weeks later, BASTA resistant transgenic plants were transferred to pots containing 0.1 g/l Gaucho SW treated potting soil. Plants were treated with 1.14 g/l phostrogen every second week. Two month old wild type N. tabacum plants were used for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. After three weeks on shooting media, transformed leaf disks displayed minimal or no necrosis and remained green in colour. The emergence of shoots was clearly visible. When untransformed leaf disks were transferred to shooting media supplemented with 3 mg/l BASTA, total necrosis was visible with the disks exhibiting a brown colour. The putative XvPsap1D, F and G transformants did not reveal any unusual or abnormal phenotypic traits. In contrast, some of the putative XvPSap1E transformants displayed signs of dwarfism. The T0 seeds were collected for all plants. Overall, mature pods gave large amounts of seed. However, some XvPSap1G plants yielded pods that contained no seed. The observed absence in seed and dwarfism in the mentioned plants could be attributed to the random insertion of the promoter cassettes into the genome of the plants. Wild type seedlings displayed complete necrosis and failed to survive on the BASTA supplemented MS media. After screening the remaining plants for the presence of the promoter, positively transformed plants were transferred to individual pots. EXAMPLE 7 Screening of Putative Transgenic Plants Leaves were sampled from putative transgenic plants and were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Dellaporta extraction protocol (Dellaporta et al., 1983) with minor modifications. Leaf tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Roughly 100 μg of ground tissue was transferred to a sterile 2 ml Eppendorf tube containing 1.4 ml of Extraction buffer (100 mM Tris-Cl pH 8, 50 mM EDTA pH 8, 500 mM NaCl and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and 0.1 ml of 20% SDS and incubated for 10 min at 65° C. Thereafter, 500 μl of 5 M potassium acetate was added and the samples shaken vigorously for 5 min followed by incubation for 20 min at 4° C. The samples were then centrifuged for 20 min at 16000×g. The supernatant was transferred to a sterile 2 ml Eppendorf tube containing 1 ml isopropanol and mixed by gentle inversion. The genomic DNA was precipitated for 24 h at −20° C. followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 16000×g. The supernatant was discarded and the pellets were air dried for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in 70 μl of Resuspension buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8, 10 mM EDTA pH 8 and 0.6 mg/ml RNase A) at room temperature. To remove insoluble debris, the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16000×g and the supernatant transferred to a sterile 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube containing 7.5 μl of 3 M potassium acetate and 50 μl isopropanol. The samples were mixed well, incubated for 15 min at 4° C. and centrifuged for 2 min at 16000×g. The supernatant was discarded and the genomic DNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 80% absolute ethanol. The mixture was centrifuged for 2 min at 16000×g and the supernatant removed. The genomic DNA pellet was redissolved in 100 μl TE (10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA). The quality of the extracted genomic DNA was assessed by electrophoresis on a 1% EtBr stained agarose gel. The presence of the bar gene was determined by PCR amplification of a 421 bp DNA fragment using gene-specific primers (BarI (SEQ ID NO:18) and BarII (SEQ ID NO:19 (Table 2))). For each amplification, 50 μl reaction volumes were set up with component concentrations as follows: 1× standard buffer, 0.4 μM of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTP mixture, 0.04 U/μl Taq polymerase, 5 ng/ul template DNA made up to the final volume with dH20. Amplification was carried out with the following conditions: 94° C. for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94° C. for 30 s, 56° C. for 45 s, 72° C. for 1 min; and a final extension of 72° C. for 10 min. The PCR reaction was performed using a GeneAmp 9700 thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems). The generated amplimers were electrophoresed on a 1% EtBr stained agarose gel. Similarly, the presence of the promoter and luc gene was determined by PCR amplification of a fragment of approximately 2 kb using a promoter-specific forward (EcoR1-XvPSap1-F (SEQ ID NO:16) and a luc-specific reverse (SEQ ID NO:20) primer pair (Table 2). For each amplification, 50 μl reaction volumes were set up with component concentrations as described above. Amplification was carried out with the following conditions: 94° C. for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94° C. for 30 s, 54° C. for 2 min, 68° C. for 90 s; and a final extension of 72° C. for 10 min.

For plants harbouring the promoter cassettes, the presence of the promoter and luc gene was determined by amplification of a DNA fragment of approximately 3 kb using a promoter-specific forward and a luc-specific reverse primer. The N. tabacum plants transformed with the XvPSap1D, E, F and G constructs yielded two, one, zero and one transformation events, respectively. Since the transformation efficiency was relatively low, plants arising from a single transformation event were screened for the various promoter constructs. Twenty one N. tabacum plants transformed with the XvPSap1D construct were identified, seven with XvPSap1E, nine with XvPSap1G. No positive transformants were identified for XvPSap1F. The transformation efficiency for each promoter construct was determined. An efficiency rate of 15%, 3.5% and 8% was calculated for XvPSap1D, E, G. EXAMPLE 8 Dehydration of Transgenic Plants The dehydration treatments were carried out as described by Audran et al (1998) with the following modification: plants were dehydrated in soil instead of hydroponically. Six plants for each promoter fragment were used in the dehydration treatment. Prior to dehydration, plants were transferred to pots containing set amounts of soil and water. Plants were moved to Percival chambers (Percival Intellus control system) and incubated under set conditions (26° C.; 16 h day, 8 h night; 60% humidity; light intensity of 100 μmol/m2/s) for 1 week. Dehydration stress was carried out on whole plants and achieved by withholding water for 6 days. Throughout the dehydration period, four stressed tobacco leaves were sampled every 24 hours. The sampled leaves were used to assay for luciferase activity and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70° C. The leaves were used for RNA isolations. An additional twelve transgenic and six wild type plants were included in the dehydration stress treatment. Throughout the dehydration period, four leaves (representing a single plant) were sampled every 24 hours. The sampled leaves were used to estimate the relative water content. The relative water content (RWC) was calculated for each sampled leaf or rosette at each time point. The fresh weight (FW) of each leaf was determined immediately after sampling. The full turgor weight (FTW) was determined after a 24 h immersion of the leaf in sterile water at room temperature. The leaves were then incubated for 48 h at 70° C. to determine the dry weight (DW). Relative water content was calculated according to the following formula: [in-line-formulae]RWC=((FW−DW)/(FTW−DW))×100.[/in-line-formulae] The soil water content (SWC) of each pot containing a dehydrated plant was determined using the HH2 Moisture Meter (Delta-T Devices). Each pot was probed and the soil water content was determined in triplicate. To determine whether the various promoters were functionally active in response to limited water conditions, transgenic plants were subjected to a six day dehydration treatment. Morphological changes such as changes in leaf colour and textures were observed during the dehydration stress treatment. On days 0 and 1, the leaves were green and turgid for all plants. The leaves of treated plants began folding downward on days 2 to 3 and by day 4 to 5, they were completely folded and flaccid. In contrast, the leaves of the hydrated plants remained green and turgid throughout the six day period. There were no notable differences in the morphological changes between the leaves of the transgenic and wild type plants. Both sets of plants appeared to display similar symptoms over the course of the treatment. The four leaves selected for RWC determination were situated towards the middle of the plant. This was because the leaves situated closer to the apex of the plant were smaller, young leaves. While the leaves situated closer to the bottom of the plant were larger and older. The RWC measurements obtained from both transgenic and wild type N. tabacum plants decreased from approximately 95% to 53%. The rate of dehydration for each plant was similar, as demonstrated by the RWC, during the treatment. However, on day 4 of the dehydration treatment, the transgenic plant had a lower RWC than the wild type plants. The RWC values of the hydrated transgenic plants fluctuated between 80% and 90% during the six day dehydration period. The SWC was determined to see if the rate of water loss was similar across all pots and that the soil in certain pots was not drying significantly differently. The SWC in the pots containing plants undergoing dehydration stress treatment decreased on average from 33% to 5%. As with RWC measurements, a similar trend was observed between plants with respect to the soil drying. The SWC of the pots harbouring transgenic plants that were watered throughout the dehydration period fluctuated between 33% and 26%. EXAMPLE 9 Analysis of Promoter Activity by Live Imaging of Luciferase Expression Prior to sampling for RNA isolations, leaves were individually sprayed and painted with equal amounts of 5 mM luciferin (VivoGlo, Promega). Luciferase activity was imaged with a 3D-luminometer consisting of a 0.5 square inch CCD camera and a field of view of 12.5 cm (Xenogen IVIS Lumina, Caliper) at an exposure time of 300 s per leaf. Photon or count emission by luciferase expressing leaves was quantified using the Living Image software (Caliper). The GFP assay was selected to negate any luminescence from chloroplasts. The intact leaves of each plant were assayed for bioluminescence, due to luciferase activity, over a six day dehydration treatment. One plant for each promoter construct was assayed for bioluminescence per day. As expected, no bioluminescence was detected in the wild type plants as these do not contain the luciferase gene. The expression of luciferase was visible as bioluminescence in the leaves of T1 plants transformed with XvPsap1D, E and G. This was visible as blue (minimal activity), green (medium activity) and red (high activity) colouring within each leaf. To quantify the levels of luciferase expression in each leaf, the region of interest (ROI) values were calculated. These values are a measure of the photons or counts that are detected due to the breakdown of luciferin to oxyluciferin. Overall, the number of counts increased over the dehydration period for plants transformed with XvPSap1D, E and G constructs (FIGS. 16B, C and D, respectively). In plants that remained hydrated over the six day period, luciferase activity remained constant (FIG. 16A). In plants transformed with XvPSap1D, E and G, there were similar levels of activity over the course of the treatment (FIGS. 16B, C and D, respectively). For XvPSap1D, induction of activity began early (day 2) and was maintained over the rest of the dehydration period. For XvPSap1E and G, it began later (day 6 and 4, respectively). As expected, no induction was observed in wild type plants (FIG. 16E). EXAMPLE 10 Analysis of Luciferase Expression by Quantitative Real-Time PCR All glassware and plastics used were double autoclaved and solutions were prepared with 0.001% diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water. Each stored leaf was individually ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle. The ground tissue was maintained at 4° C. during the extraction procedure to prevent RNA degradation. Approximately 600 mg of ground tissue was transferred to a sterile 2 ml Eppendorf tube containing 1 ml of One-Step reagent (Bio Basic) and mixed by inversion. Thereafter, samples were vortexed for 10 min at room temperature. To allow complete dissociation of the nucleoprotein complexes, the samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Following incubation at room temperature, 200 μl of chloroform was added and the samples were inverted 30 times and then incubated for 3 min at room temperature. Samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 4° C. at 14000×g. The upper aqueous phase was carefully transferred to a fresh sterile 2 ml Eppendorf tube containing 1 ml of isopropanol and mixed by inversion. The mixture was allowed to settle for 10 min at room temperature before the RNA was pelleted by centrifugation for 15 min at 4° C. at 14000×g. The supernatant was discarded and the RNA pellet was washed with 1 ml of ice cold 75% ethanol, vortexed briefly and centrifuged for 10 min at 4° C. The supernatant was discarded and the RNA pellet was air dried for 5 min and dissolved in 89 μl of 0.01% DEPC treated water. Dissolution was enhanced by incubating the RNA for 10 min at 55° C. The RNA was stored at −70° C. Each RNA extraction was treated with Deoxyribonuclease I (DNAse I; New England Biolabs) to digest and remove any genomic DNA contamination. The DNAse I reaction mixture consisted of 89 μl of isolated RNA, 10 μl of 10× DNAse buffer and 2 units of DNAse I in a total reaction volume of 100 μl. The reaction was mixed gently and incubated for 10 min at 37° C. The sample was purified using the GeneJet Plant RNA Miniprep Kit (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purified RNA was quantified using the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). The RNA integrity was assessed by electrophoresis at on a 1.2% EtBr stained agarose gel. Furthermore, the quality and integrity was assessed on a RNA-6000 Nano chip using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and analysed using the Agilent 2100 Expert Software (Anatech). The concentration of RNA extracted for each isolation ranged from 89 to 543 ng/μl. Minimal to no degradation was observed when RNA was electrophoresed on a 1.2% non-denaturing agarose/EtBr gel. The 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) bands were clearly visible. Bands of lower molecular weight were also observed, corresponding to the 5S rRNA and chloroplast RNA. The Agilent Expert software analyses RNA by assigning an RNA Integrity Number (RIN) to each sample. The RIN number is calculated based on the amount of signal found between the 5S and 18s rRNA and between the 18S and 28S rRNA bands. A RIN number of 10 indicates that the RNA is pure and that only 5S, 18S and 28S rRNA peaks are present. However, isolation of RNA from plant tissue also includes chloroplast RNA. This decreases the RIN value, but does not imply that the RNA is of poor quality. However purified RNA with a RIN number below 5.3 is generally considered to be of poor quality and not suitable for analysis. The Agilent 2100 Expert Software generates an electropherogram with peaks corresponding to the different RNA species. The 5S, 18S and 28S rRNA bands are clearly visible as peaks. No genomic DNA contamination is present as that would be visible as a peak downstream of the 28S rRNA peak. The presence of chloroplast RNA is visible as peaks situated between the 5S and 18S rRNA. A post 28S rRNA hump is visible, corresponding to undenatured RNA. The RNA extracted for each isolation was analysed using the Agilent 2100 Expert Software. The RIN values ranged from 4.6 to 8.8 and the concentrations from 100 ng/μl to 732 ng/μl. The electropherograms of RNA isolated from dehydration treated wild type and transgenic plants containing XvPSap1D, E, G as well as hydrated plants displayed all of the previously mentioned RNA species. RNA of either poor quality or low concentration was discarded. The purified RNA extracted from the four leaf samples of each N. tabacum plants over the dehydration period were pooled and used for cDNA synthesis. Approximately 500 ng of RNA was used per cDNA synthesis reaction. This reaction was performed in quadruplicate to act as technical cDNA synthesis repeats. For cDNA synthesis, M-MuLV RNase H+ reverse transcriptase (Finnzymes) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA synthesis reaction mix consisted of approximately 500 ng of RNA, a final concentration of 0.05 μg oligo (dT)15 primers, 0.45 μg random hexamers, 1× RT buffer (includes dNTPs and MgCl2) and 0.04 μl M-MuLV RNase H+ reverse transcriptase (includes an RNA inhibitor) made up to a total volume of 20 μl with nuclease free water and mixed well. A ratio of 1:10 of random hexamers to oligo (dT)15 was selected for cDNA synthesis as this method increases the sensitivity of the synthesis reaction. The PCR cycle conditions consisted of incubation at 25° C. for 5 min, 42° C. for 1 hour, 85° C. for 15 min followed by a final step at 4° C. for 2 min. An aliquot of cDNA synthesis was electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose/EtBr gel to analyse cDNA quality. The cDNA was stored at −20° C. until further use. Serial dilutions of pooled cDNA from the treated samples were used to generate five-point standard curves. For the 18S rRNA and luciferase standard curves, a 10-fold and 3-fold dilution series was prepared respectively. For the L25 ribosomal protein and elongation factor-1α standard curves, a 4-fold dilution series was prepared. Expression of the reference genes and luciferase gene was investigated by real time PCR using the Rotor Gene 6000 2 plex HRM (Corbett Life Science Research). The Kapa Sybr Fast Kit (Kapa BioSystems) master mix containing reaction buffer, heat activated DNA polymerase, dNTPs and a working concentration of 3 mM MgCl2 were used for each PCR reaction. Each PCR reaction contained a final concentration of 1× Kapa Sybr Fast, 0.04 μM gene specific primers (Table 3), 2 μl of cDNA and nuclease free water to a total volume of 20 μl. Gene specific primer sets for luciferase (RT-luc-F2 (SEQ ID NO:21) and RT-luc-R2 (SEQ ID NO:22), 18S rRNA (RT-18S-F3 (SEQ ID NO:23) and RT-18S-R3 (SEQ ID NO:24)), L25 ribosomal protein (RT-Rib-F3 (SEQ ID NO:25) and RT-Rib-R3 (SEQ ID NO:26)) and elongation factor1-α (RT-EF-F1 (SEQ ID NO:27) and RT-EF-R1 (SEQ ID NO:28)) were used in separate reactions. Each dilution point reaction was performed in quadruplicate. A no reverse transcription control (pooled RNA) as well as a no template control (NTC) was included in each real time run. Amplification was carried out with the following conditions: 95° C. for 5 min; 45 cycles of 95° C. for 5 s, 60° C. for 20 s, 72° C. for 5 s. Generation and analysis of standard curves were performed using the Rotor-Gene 6000 Series software (Corbett Life Science Research).

To minimise variations between PCR runs, all of the reactions containing one primer pair was performed in one run. The average expression levels were calculated from four technical repeats and by importing the relative standard curve into each run. Relative gene expression was determined by the amplification threshold in the exponential phase of the PCR, identifying the Ct value and comparing the Ct value to the standard curve (Muller et al., 2002). The stability of the potential reference genes were evaluated using both GeNorm and NormFinder (GenEx, MultiD). Real time PCR reaction mixes and conditions were set up as above. To minimise variations between PCR runs, all of the reactions containing one primer pair was performed in one run. The standard curves were imported into each run to determine the Ct values and concentrations of the gene of interest and the reference gene. The determined values of the gene of interest were divided by that of the reference gene. The averages of the calculated values were used for relative quantification of the gene of interest. The value obtained for transcript levels on day 0 was used as a calibrator to determine whether a significant change in expression of the gene of interest occurs during dehydration. Relative quantification levels were determined using the GenEx software (MultiD) according to the Pfaffl equation (Pfaffl, 2001). The Pfaffl equation of one sample is the ratio of the gene of interest (target) versus a calibrator sample (control) and the reference gene (reference) versus a calibrator sample (control). The amplification efficiencies (E) were calculated according to the equation: E=10[−1/slope]. The difference in Ct values of the target gene in the control and sample (ΔCt target) and in the reference gene in the control and sample (ΔCt reference) are considered (Pfaffl, 2001). The equation is as follows: [in-line-formulae]Ratio=((Etarget)ΔCt target(control-sample))/((Ereference)ΔCt reference(control-sample)) Ratio =((E target)/reference))[/in-line-formulae] In order to quantify the luc gene expression levels, quantitative real time PCR was performed. This quantification was performed to confirm the results obtained from the promoter analysis in intact leaves. The cDNA synthesis was successful as evidenced by a DNA smear following electrophoresis). A single primer set was chosen for each amplimer based on analysis of product size and whether a single peak in the melt curve had been observed. A standard curve for each potential reference gene and luc gene was produced. The efficiencies, R-values and R̂2-values for the potential reference genes are listed in Table 4. TABLE 4 Efficiencies, R-values and R{circumflex over ( )}2-values of the potential reference genes and luc gene. GENE EFFICIENCY R-VALUE R{circumflex over ( )}2-VALUE 18S rRNA 0.89 0.9991 0.9982 EF-1α 0.82 0.9994 0.9988 L25 ribosomal protein 0.79 0.9992 0.9984 Luc 0.99 0.9953 0.9905 Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on cDNA isolated from dehydration treated plants. The generated standard curve for each reference gene was imported and its stability of the reference gene was assessed using geNorm and NormFinder. geNorm is based on the assumption that the expression ratio between two genes should be the same if both are stably expressed (Vandesompele et al., 2001). The relative stability (M) of each gene is defined as the mean pairwise variation of the gene with the other reference genes. The lower the M value, the more stable the reference gene. geNorm identified both L25 ribosomal protein and EF-1α with an M value of 0.037785 as being the best reference genes. NormFinder assesses the stability of the reference genes by comparing the variation between the genes. The reference genes that are most stable are those with the lowest variation. Normfinder identified EF-1α as the most stable reference gene followed by L25 ribosomal protein. Both programmes identified 18S rRNA as the least stable of the three. Based on both geNorm and NormFinder analysis, EF-1α and L25 ribosomal protein were chosen as reference genes. It should be noted that Schmidt and Delaney (2010) also concluded that these genes were the most suitable in a N. tabacum dehydration stress treatment analysis. The acquisition and purification of RNA is the first step in quantitative real time PCR and therefore RNA needs to be of high quality. Furthermore, the RNA should be free of genomic DNA, particularly if the target is a gene that lacks introns. Since the target gene (luc) does not contain any introns, an RNA control reaction was included in every real time run to demonstrate the absence of genomic DNA and subsequently confirm that any detected luc mRNA was not a product of genomic DNA contamination but rather of the cDNA template. In all of the real time runs, no luc mRNA was detected as a product of genomic DNA. The same result was obtained for the reference gene. No products were detected in the no template control reactions as well. As with the analysis of luciferase activity in intact leaves, promoter analysis was determined in only one plant by measuring luc mRNA transcripts at each time point. A consequence is that a full analysis of the data was not possible. However, qRT-PCR was used as a tool to assess the promoter activity in T1 plants and not to determine absolute activity. The overall trend of each promoter thus was assessed. As no repeats were included in the study, standard deviation between readings was determined across leaves in a single plant. Overall, the luc mRNA transcripts increased over the dehydration period for plants transformed with XvPSap1D, E and G and all of resulted in similar levels of induction (FIGS. 17B, C and D, respectively). In plants that remained hydrated over the six day period, the luc mRNA transcripts remained constant (FIG. 17A). For XvPSap1E, induction began early (day 2 and 3) and was maintained over the rest of the dehydration period. For XvPSap1D and G, induction also began early (day 1) but transcript levels decreased on day 3 and 2, respectively, before increasing again towards the end of the dehydration period. As expected, no induction was observed in wild type plants. Although analysis was only determined in one biological plant at each time point, an overall trend was clearly observed. All of the promoter fragments were able to drive expression of the luc mRNA transcripts. Over the dehydration period, the levels of those transcripts increased to a similar level. EXAMPLE 11 To verify the promoter expression results obtained in T1 transgenic plants the methodologies used in Examples 9 and 10 were repeated with minor modifications as described below. T3 transgenic plants transformed with either the XvPSap1D or XvPSap1G derivative promoter constructs were used. In this example, four biological plants were used per derivative promoter construct. For each of the biologicals five technical repeats were included. Dehydration treatments were carried out as described in Example 8 of the specification with the following minor modifications. For each treatment, 24 plants for each promoter fragment (XvPSap1D and XvPSap1G) were exposed to dehydration treatment for analysis of promoter activity. Additionally, 24 plants (XvPSap1D) were included in the dehydration treatment for determination of relative water content (RWC). Further, live imaging of luciferase expression was carried out as described in Example 9 with the following modifications. T3 transgenic plants transformed with either the XvPSap1D or XvPSap1G derivative promoter constructs were used. Further, four biological plants were used per promoter construct as compared to one in Example 9. Accordingly, in FIG. 18 a single data point is reflective of data obtained from the mean of expression results accumulated from a total of 16 leaves. Similarly, an analysis of luciferase expression by quantitative real-time PCR was performed as described in Example 10 using T3 transgenic plants. Four biological plants were used per promoter construct and five technical repeats were performed per plant. The results of this analysis are shown in FIG. 19. REFERENCES Audran, C., et al.
