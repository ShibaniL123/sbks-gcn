Example 13
Synthesis of tert-butyl (R)-4-(6-(6-(benzoyloxy)ethyl-8-(1-methoxy-2-methylpropan-2-ylamino)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-2-ylamino)pyridin-3-yl)piperazine-1-carboxylate
The (R)-1-(8-(1-methoxy-2-methylpropan-2-ylamino)-2-(methylsulfinyl)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-6-yl) ethyl benzoate synthesized in Example 9 (1.9 g, 4.3 mmol) and the tert-butyl 4-(6-aminopyridin-3-yl)piperazine-1-carboxylate synthesized in Reference Example 5 (3.59 g, 12.9 mmol) were suspended in toluene (30 mL) and the reaction mixture was stirred at 120Â°C overnight. The reaction was monitored by LC/MS. The resultant reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the solvent was removed through evaporation under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography to yield the title compound (850 mg, 30%).
