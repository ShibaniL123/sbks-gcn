0.400 g (1.26 mmol) of the white solid F6a was dissolved in 30 mL DMF then 0.500 g phenol and 0.694 g (5.02 mmol) potassium carbonate were added. The mixture was heated to 145° C. and stirred for 1.5 hours at this temperature. After the cooling to room temperature, the solvent was removed on the rotary evaporator and the brownish residue was taken up in 100 mL chloroform. The organic phase was washed with 50 mL each of 5% sodium hydroxide solution (2 times), water (2 times) and saturated sodium chloride solution (1 time) and dried over MgSO4. The yellow residue was chromatographed on silica gel 60. It was possible to elute the product with an 8:1 mixture of dichloromethane and ethyl acetate. After removal of the solvent mixture, it was possible to obtain 94% (0.392 g) F6. The quantum yield of F6 (10−5 M) in Momentive RTV 655 was λeX (371)=0.75.
