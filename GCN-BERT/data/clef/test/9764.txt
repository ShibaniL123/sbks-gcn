In addition, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; an anti-HIV agent, an HIV integrase inhibitor and the like, comprising the derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an active ingredient; an anti-HIV agent comprising a combination of the derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and one or more kinds of other anti-HIV active substances; and the like. BACKGROUND ART HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus (type 1)) belonging to retrovirus is a causative virus of AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome). HIV targets CD4 positive cell groups such as helper T cell, macrophage and dendritic cell and destroys these immunocompetent cells to cause immunodeficiency. Accordingly, a medicament that eradicates HIV in a living organism or suppresses its growth is effective for the prophylaxis or treatment of AIDS. HIV possesses a bimolecular RNA gene in a shell, which is covered with an envelope protein. The RNA codes for several enzymes (protease, reverse transcriptase, integrase) characteristic of the virus and the like. Translated reverse transcriptase and integrase are present in the shell, and protease is present inside and outside the shell. HIV contacts and invades a host cell, causes uncoating, and releases a complex of RNA and integrase and the like into the cytoplasm. From the RNA, DNA is transcribed by reverse transcriptase, and a full length double stranded DNA is produced. The DNA moves into the nucleus of the host cell and is incorporated by integrase into the DNA of the host cell. The incorporated DNA is converted to an mRNA by polymerase of the host cell, from which mRNA various proteins necessary for forming a virus are synthesized by HIV protease and the like, and a virus particle is finally formed, which then undergoes budding and its release. These virus specific enzymes are considered to be essential for the growth of HIV. These enzymes are drawing attention as the target of the development of antiviral agents, and several anti-HIV agents have been already developed. For example, tenofovir, abacavir, emtricitabine, lamivudine and the like have been already on the market as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, efavirenze, nevirapine and the like as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, and atazanavir, darunavir and the like as protease inhibitors. In addition, a multiple drug combination therapy using these medicaments in combination (to be also referred to as cART (combination antiretroviral therapy)) is also used. For example, 3 agent combination therapy using two agents from nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (tenofovir and emtricitabine, or abacavir and lamivudine), and a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (efavirenz), or a protease inhibitor (atazanavir or darunavir) in combination with ritonavir, and the like is used in clinical practice, and such cART is becoming the mainstream of the AIDS treatment. However, some of these medicaments are known to cause side effects such as liver function failure, central nervous disorders (e.g., vertigo), and the like. In addition, acquisition of resistance to a medicament causes a problem. Even worse, emergence of an HIV that shows multiple drug resistance in a cART has been known. Under the circumstances, a further development of a novel medicament, particularly a development of an anti-HIV agent based on a new mechanism, has been desired, wherein a development of an anti-HIV agent having an integrase inhibitory activity is expected, because the integrase that is a feature of retrovirus is an essential enzyme for the growth of HIV. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Problems to be Solved by the Invention From the findings obtained from pharmacological studies and clinical results heretofore, an anti-HIV agent is effective for the prophylaxis or treatment of AIDS, and particularly a compound having an integrase inhibitory activity can be an effective anti-HIV agent. Therefore, the present invention aims at provision of a compound having an anti-HIV activity, particularly a compound having an integrase inhibitory activity.

Experimental Example 2: Evaluation of anti-integrase activity The following explains evaluation methods of the HIV integrase inhibitory activity of the compound of the present invention. (i) Construction of recombinant integrase gene expression system A full-length gene sequence (Accession No.: M19921) of HIV-1 pNL4-3 integrase is inserted into restriction enzyme Nde I and Xho I sites of plasmid pET21a(+) (manufactured by Novagen) to construct an integrase expression vector pET21a-IN-Wild type. (ii) Production and purification of integrase protein Escherichia coli recombinant BL21(DE3) transformed with plasmid pET21a-IN-Wild type obtained in (i) is shake cultured at 30°C in a liquid medium containing ampicillin. When the culture reached the logarithmic growth phase, isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside is added to promote expression of integrase gene. The culture is continued for 5 hr to promote accumulation of the integrase protein. The recombinant E. coli is collected in pellets by centrifugal separation and preserved at -80°C. This Escherichia coli is suspended in Lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mM MgCl2, 5 mM DTT), and disrupted by repeating treatments of pressurization and depressurization, and insoluble fraction is collected by centrifugation at 4°C, 18,000 rpm for 60 min. This is suspended in Lysis buffer containing a protease inhibitor, 1.25 mM sodium chloride and 10 mM CHAPS are added, and the mixture is stirred at 4°C for 30 min. Watersoluble fraction is collected by centrifugation at 4°C, 9,000 rpm for 30 min. The obtained fraction is diluted with a column buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mM DTT, 10% Glycerol, 10 mM CHAPS) to 5-fold, and the mixture is applied to heparin column (HiPrep 16/10 Heparin FF column: manufactured by GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). Using a column buffer containing 1M NaCl, a protein is eluted with 0-1M NaCl concentration gradient, and an eluted fraction containing an integrase protein is collected. The obtained fraction is diluted 5-fold with a column buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mM DTT, 10% Glycerol, 10 mM CHAPS), and the mixture is applied to cation exchange column (Mono-S column: manufactured by GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). Using a column buffer containing 1M NaCl, a protein is eluted with 0-1M NaCl concentration gradient, and an eluted fraction containing an integrase protein is collected. The obtained fractions of the integrase protein are collected, and preserved at -80°C. (iii) Preparation of DNA solution The following DNA synthesized by FASMAC is dissolved in TE buffer (10 mM Tris-hydrochloric acid (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA) and mixed with donor DNA, target DNA, and each complementary strand (+ and - strands) to 1 µM. The mixture is heated at 95°C for 5 min, 80°C for 10 min, 70°C for 10 min, 60°C for 10 min, 50°C for 10 min and 40°C for 10 min and kept at 25°C to give a double stranded DNA, which is used for the test.

The plate is washed with phosphate buffer (Dulbecco's PBS, Takara) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and phosphate buffer. Then, an enzyme reaction mixture (70 µL), a test substance (10 µL) diluted with the enzyme reaction mixture and 0.75 µM integrase protein (10 µL) are added to each well and the mixture is reacted at 37°C for 60 min. composition of enzyme reaction mixture: 30 mM MOPS (3-morpholinopropanesulfonic acid), 5 mM magnesium chloride, 3 mM DTT (dithiothreitol), 0.1 mg/mL BSA (bovine serum albumin), 5% glycerol, 10% DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), 0.01% Tween 20. Then, 25 nM target DNA (10 µL) is added, and the mixture is reacted at 37°C for 20 min and washed with phosphate buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 to stop the reaction. Then, 100 mU/mL peroxidase labeled anti-digoxigenin antibody solution (Roche, 100 µL) is added, and the mixture is reacted at 37°C for 60 min, followed by washing with phosphate buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20. Then, peroxidase fluorescence substrate solution (manufactured by PIAS Corporation, 100 µL) is added, and the mixture is reacted at room temperature for 20 min to 30 min. A reaction quenching liquid (manufactured by PIAS Corporation, 100 µL) is added to discontinue the reaction, and fluorescence intensity at excitation wavelength 325 nm/fluorescence wavelength 420 nm is measured. The HIV integrase inhibitory activity (IC50) of the compound of the present invention is calculated from the inhibition rate according to the following formula: inhibition rate%=1-Object-Blank/Control-Blank×100 Object: fluorescence intensity of well in the presence of test compound Control: fluorescence intensity of well in the absence of test compound Blank: fluorescence intensity of well in the absence of test compound and integrase protein Experimental Example 3 in vitrocombined use test The effect of combined use of the compound of the present invention and existent anti-HIV agents can be determined in the following manner. For example, the effect of combined use of existent nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (zidovudine, lamivudine), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (efavirenz, etravirine) or protease inhibitors (atazanavir, darunavir) and test substance A and the like are evaluated using MT-2 cells infected with HIV-1 IIIB by CellTiter-Glo. Prior to the combined use test, EC50 and CC50 of each medicament alone are measured. 5 concentrates of medicament A and 7 concentrates of medicament B, determined based on these results, are combined to evaluate the effect of combined use of two agents. The test results of the test substance and concomitant drug alone or in combination thereof are analyzed based on the programs of Prichard and Shipman MacSynergy II. A three-dimensional plot is drawn from % inhibition at the concentrations of each combined medicament, the obtained from 3 times of tests, with 95% confidence limits, and the effect of the combined use is evaluated based on the numerical values of µM2% calculated therefrom. The criteria of evaluation are shown in the following.
