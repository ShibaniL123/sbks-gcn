This application claims priority from UK provisional application No. 0819296.5 entitled “Coating II” filed on 21 October 2008, which is herein incorporated in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to a coating composition for an implantable medical device, a method of coating a medical device and a device coated with the composition. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION Stents are small expandable metal tubes that are implanted in arteries to keep them open in patients whose vessels have become narrowed due to coronary artery disease, the most common cause of death in the Western World. Bare metal stents sometimes become re-narrowed again (restenosis) requiring a re-intervention procedure to re-open them. A drug-eluting stent, sometimes referred to as a “coated” or “medicated” stent, is a normal bare metal stent that has been coated with a polymer containing a pharmacologic (drug) that is known to interfere with the process of restenosis (renarrowing). Restenosis has a number of causes; it is a very complex process and the solution to its prevention is equally complex. However, in the data gathered so far, the drug-eluting stent has been extremely successful in reducing restenosis from the 20-30% range to single digits. After stent implantation, in addition to aspirin, the patient must take an anti-clotting or anti-platelet drug, such as clopidogrel or ticlopidine (brand names Plavix and Ticlid) for six or more months after stenting, to prevent the blood from reacting to the new device by thickening and clogging up the newly expanded artery (thrombosis). Ideally a smooth, thin layer of endothelial cells (the inner lining of the blood vessel) grows over the stent during this period and the device is incorporated into the artery, reducing the tendency for clotting. Despite the clinical and commercial success of drug-eluting stents, recent evidence has suggested that they result in higher rates of late stage thrombosis, a clot formation at the end of the stent, which, in over 50% of cases, results in either an acute heart attack or death. Many physicians believe that the clot formations are due to the delayed healing of the vessel caused by the cytotoxic drugs that coat the stent or by some biostable polymers that are used to deliver the drug. In response to these concerns some physicians are defaulting to using bare metal stents, where late stent thrombosis is not seen as much of a problem. Recently, industry has been working on replacing the biostable polymer coatings used in first generation drug-eluting stents with bioresorbable polymers. Most of the current bioresorbable coatings used for the drug-eluting stents are based on poly(lactide), poly(glycolide) or co-polymers of the two (poly(lactide-co-glycolide)). It is difficult to control the drug-elution profile with these polymers, one problem being a “burst release” of the drug that gives a high initial release of drug followed by a slow release, whereas what is desired is a more steady and sustained release. Another problem with coatings on stents is the adhesion of the polymer to the metal surface. Most polymer coatings will not adhere strongly to a normal metal surface and the coating may delaminate when the stent is deployed inside the vessel. As a result, there is a requirement for a new generation of drug-eluting stents which have bioresorbable coatings in place of the current stable (non-resorbable) coatings. In this way the stent can deliver its payload of a drug from the coating but once the drug has been delivered the coating resorbs so that the stent effectively reverts to a bare metal stent, with lower chance of late stent thrombosis. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The coating composition of the invention is a drug-eluting bioresorbable coating. The composition of the coating allows control of the elution profile of the drug as well as allowing strong adhesion of the coating to a metal surface and resistance to damage.

In embodiments of the invention the composition comprises a blend of co-polymers. For example the second co-polymer of the blend is also a co-polymer of a lactide, a glycolide and e-caprolactone. In a specific embodiment of the invention the bioresorbable coating composition comprises a blend of a first co-polymer comprising 47.5% D,L-lactide, 40% glycolide and 12.5% s-caprolactone and a second co-polymer comprising 57.5% D,L-lactide, 30% glycolide and 12.5% s-caprolactone. A “bioactive agent” or “drug” is herein defined as any biological and/or chemical substance used in the treatment, cure, prevention, or diagnosis of disease or used to otherwise enhance physical or mental well-being. Examples of a suitable drug type for incorporation into the coating composition of the present invention include, an anti-inflammatory agent, a cytotoxic agent, an angiogenic agent, an osteogenic agent, an immunosuppressant, an anti-clotting agent, an anti-platelet agent, an antimicrobial or an antibiotic. Suitable anti-platelet agents include clopidogrel, sold as Plavix™ by Bristol Myers-Squibb and ticlopidine, sold as Ticlid™ by Sanofi-Aventis. Suitable anti-clotting agents include heparin. Suitable immunosuppressants include rapamycin, also known as Sirolimus available from A.G Scientific Inc. Suitable antibiotics include gentamicin and vancamycin. In embodiments of the invention the composition comprises rapamycin at about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% by weight of the composition. In a specific embodiment of the invention the composition comprises rapamycin at between about 20- 30% by weight of the composition. In a further specific embodiment of the invention the composition comprises rapamycin at about 25% by weight of the composition. A bioactive agent is herein defined as any agent that has an effect on, interaction with, or response from living tissue. For example, an antibody or a cell (e.g a stem cell). The composition can further comprise at least one additive which is an acid or a derivative thereof selected from the group consisting of hexanoic acid, octanoic acid, decanoic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid, crotonic acid, 4-pentenoic acid, 2-hexenoic acid, undecylenic acid, petroselenic acid, oleic acid, erucic acid, 2,4-hexadienoic acid, linoleic acid, linolenicacid, benzoic acid, hydrocinnamicacid, 4-isopropylbenzoic acid, ibuprofen, ricinoleic acid, adipic acid, suberic acid, phthalic acid, 2-bromolauric acid, 2,4-hydroxydodecanoic acid, butyric acid, monobutyrin, 2-hexyldecanoic acid, 2-butyloctanoic acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, 2-methylvaleric acid, 3-methylvaleric acid, 4-methylvaleric acid, 2-ethylbutyric acid, trans-betahydromuconic acid, isovaleric anhydride, hexanoic anhydride, decanoic anhydride, lauric anhydride, myristic anhydride, 4-pentenoic anhydride, oleic anhydride, linoleic anhydride, benzoic anhydride, poly(azelaicanhydride),. 2-octen-1-yl succinic anhydride and phthalic anhydride. Aptly the composition contains the additive in an amount which is not more than 10%, typically not more than 5%, and even more typically not more than 2% by weight of the composition. The amount of the additive chosen will also depend upon the rate of degradation desired. In vivo degradation occurs firstly by hydrolytic scission of the polymer chains resulting in the formation of units of increasingly smaller molecular weight until only substantially monomers remain. Thereafter, the monomers are metabolized and absorbed into the body. It is only in the last stages of degradation that mass loss occurs. It has been found that a particularly suitable additive for use in the invention is lauric acid. This may be employed as the acid per se or, if desired, as a derivative, for example as the anhydride. Advantageously compositions will contain lauric acid a derivative thereof in an amount not more than 10%, more typically not more than 5%, and even more typically not more than 2% by weight of the composition. The bioresorbable coating composition of the invention may be applied directly to the implantable medical device. However, most polymeric coatings will not adhere strongly to a normal metal surface and the coating has a tendency to de-laminate. In embodiments of the invention the bioresorbable coating of the invention is chemically and/or physically coupled to the surface of the device. In embodiments of the invention “functionalisation” of the metal surface improves the adhesion of the polymeric coating to the surface of the medical device and minimises the risk of delamination. This functionalisation provides a “chemical bridge” between the metal surface and the polymeric coating. In the first stage of the functionalisation process a chemical is chosen that reacts well with the inherent functionality of the metai surface. The chemical preferably reacts with the oxides, hydroxides, epoxide or any other surface oxide on metallic surfaces to form strong bonds whilst leaving the rest of the molecule free to react with other species. Suitable chemicals for use in the first reaction step include alkoxysilanes of the formula (RO)3Si(R1X) wherein R represents methyl or ethyl and R1 represents C2-C10 alkyl in which one or more methylene groups may be replaced by -ΝΗ- or -0-, C2-C-io cycloalkyl or cycloaIkylalkyl, C2-Ci0 aralkyl or monocylic or bicyclic aryl and X represents amino, hydroxyl, carboxylic acid or acid anhydride. Preferably R1 represents C2-C10 alkyl in which one or more methylene groups is optionally replaced by -ΝΗ- and X represents ~NH2, and an example of a suitable priming agent is N-[3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl]ethylenediamine. In the second stage, another chemical is chosen which reacts readily with the functional/reactive groups of the first chemical and which also has a functional group which can react with oxygen containing groups in the polymer, for example, hydroxyl, methoxy and ethoxy groups. A strong bond is therefore formed between the two molecules and the polymer is coupled to the functionalised surface. In this way a strong chemical bond is achieved between the functionalised surface and the polymer, improving the adhesion of the polymer to the metal surface. Any chemical with an alkoxysilyl group on one end and an isocyanate on the other end is suitable for use in the second reaction step. An example of an appropriate chemical is 3-(triethoxysiiyl)propylisocyanate. Figures 1 and 2 illustrate the functionalisation process. In embodiments of the invention the bioresorbable coating composition of the first aspect of the invention contains -OH groups to react with the triethoxy groups from the second functionalisation step. In further embodiments of the invention an intermediate coating composition is provided between at least part of the surface of the device and the bioresorbable coating composition of the first aspect of the invention to physically “tie” the coating composition in place. This intermediate coating composition can be referred to as a “primer coat” or a “tie coat”. This composition comprises a lower molecular weight polymer of similar or identical chemical composition to the polymeric component of the bioresorbable coating composition of the first aspect of the invention. The polymeric composition of the “tie coat” can be any polymer which is capable of forming a strong adhesion with the polymeric component of the bioresorbable coating composition of the first aspect of the invention. In embodiments of the invention the primer coat comprises a co-polymer of a lactide and a glycolide, for example poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide), specifically in which the ratio of D,L-lactide to glycolide is 50:50 and the molecular weight of the copolymer is between about 5 -15k. The primer coat may be applied directly to at least part of the surface of the device and then the bioresorbable coating composition according to' the first aspect of the invention is applied so as to overlay at least part of the primer coat. In alternative embodiments of the invention the surface of the device may be chemically functionalised as described above, with the primer coat being applied to this'functionalised surface and then the bioresorbable coating composition of the first aspect of the invention being applied so as to overlay at least part of the primer coat The elution profile of the drug can be further controlled by the use of undrugged top-coat covering, wholly or partially the bioactive/drug-containing layer (i.e the bioresorbable coating composition according to the first aspect of the invention). This composition can comprise a polymer of similar or identical chemical composition to the bioresorbable coating composition according to the first aspect of the invention. For example, the top coat may be a copolymer of lactide, glycolide and εcaprolactone or it may be a copolymer of D,L-lactide and glycolide. The top coat can form between about 1%-50%, or about 1%-45%, or about 1%-40%, or about 1%-35%, or about 1%-30%, or about 1%-25%, or about 1%-20%, or about 1%-15%, or about 1℅-10℅, or about 1%-5%, or about 5%-10%, or about 5%-15%, or about 5%-20%, or about 10%-20%, or about 15%-20% of the total coating weight (e.g: (i) bioresorbable coating composition according to the first aspect of the invention + top coat or (ii) primer coat + bioresorbable coating composition according to the first aspect of the invention + top coat) In further embodiments of the invention the polymer component of all of the polymeric coatings may comprise a blend of two or more polymers that themselves comprise copolymers of lactide, glycolide and s-caprolactone, for example in the ratios outlined above. Medical devices for which this coating technology may be advantageous, include but are not limited to stents, orthopaedic implants, dental implants and maxillo-facial implants. Examples of stents to which the drug-eluting bioresorbable coating of the invention can be applied include coronary stents, carotid stents, aortic stents, renal stents and venous stents. Other examples of stents include peripheral stents. Examples of orthopaedic implants to which the drug-eluting bioresorbable coating can be applied include reconstructive and trauma products, for example, components of hip replacement, components of knee replacements, fracture plates, screws, pins, external fixation plates, intramedullary nails, interference screws, suture anchors. Examples of maxillo-facial implants to which the drug-eluting bioresorbable coating of the invention can be applied include plates, screws and meshes.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION EXAMPLE 1 Polymerisation i) Materials DL-lactide (Purac) Glycolide (Purac) s-Caprolactone (Aldrich) Tin(ll) chloride dihydrate (Aldrich) Diethylene glycol (Aldrich) Dichloromethane (Fisher) ii) Initiator-catalyst system Tin(ll) chloride dihydrate (0.5g) was added to diethylene glycol (1.46g) and heated gently to dissolve the tin chloride iii) Polymer production D,L-lactide, glycolide and s-caprolactone were weighed into a Wheaton vial, total weight of 40g. 10 microlitres of tin chloride in diethylene glycol was added to each vial together with 100 microlitres of diethylene glycol. The vials were placed in an oil bath set at 150°C and stirred until the viscosity became so great that the magnetic follower wouldn’t go round after which time the vials were placed in the oven at 150°C and left for ~ 16 hours. To remove the polymer from the vials dichloromethane was added and the vials rolled until the polymer dissolved. The polymer solution was poured onto siiiconised paper and the dichloromethane evaporated off. To remove residual monomer the polymers were melted under vacuum to boil the monomer off.

The samples were then dried at 100°C for 16 hours, followed by drying at 50°C for 30 minutes. Stage 2: Functionalisation 2.5 ml glacial acetic acid solution in toluene (1.0% w/w, 0.4mmol) was added to 200 ml toluene followed by 1.6 ml TMSPEA and mixed. The samples were removed from the 50°C oven and immersed in the solution for 5 minutes. The., samples were removed and kept at 50°C for 20 hours. The samples were rinsed in a series of solvents by rotating sequentially for 15 minutes in ,each of toluene, methanol, deionised water, methanol and deionised water. Finally, the samples were rinsed for 5 minutes in methanol and then dried at 50°C for 2 hours. Anhydrous toluene was added, under nitrogen, into a measuring cylinder being purged with nitrogen. Enough TESPI was added to give a 4% ν/ν solution in toluene. The samples (dried at 50°C for 15 minutes and allowed to cool for two minutes before use) were immersed in the solution on a holder and rotated under nitrogen for 15 minutes. The samples were then rinsed in anhydrous toluene under nitrogen and dried under vacuum for 16 hours. Stage 3: Applying a primer coat The stents were attached to a mandrel and coated with a primer solution containing 0.5% w/w PLGA1 in CHCI3 on a Sonotek MediCoat Benchtop Coater. The parameters used were: 0.075ml/min flow rate, 0.8W ultrasonic power, 2 passes, 40rpm rotation, 0.13cm/s horizontal travel and 25mm from stent to spray head. After priming, the stents were left for 16 hours at 100°C. Stage 4: Preparing the drug-containing biresorbable coating Solutions were prepared by dissolving the polymers listed in Table 1 in CHCI3with 25% (by weight of the solid polymer) rapamycin. Stage 5: Coating After cooling for 5 minutes, the stents were attached to a mandrel and coated on the Sonotek MediCoat Benchtop Coater with a 0.5% w/w solution in CHCI3 of polymer/drug (75/25). The parameters used were: 0.09ml/min flow rate, 1.0W ultrasonic power, 16 passes, 40rpm rotation, 0.13cm/s horizontal travel and 25mm from stent to spray head. After coating, the stents were dried under vacuum for 16 hours at 40°C. Stage 6: Elution Testing The stents were released into phosphate buffered saline solution (PBS) at 37°C and the elution monitored by UV/vis spectroscopy. Fresh buffer solution was added after each reading and the cumulative absorbance at 279nm was recorded. Results Figure 3 shows the effect of varying the proportion of s-caprolactone in the polymer on the release of rapamycin; increasing the fraction of s-caprolactone increases the rate at which rapamycin is released. Figure 4 shows the effect of changing the ratio of D,L-lactide:glycolide with a fixed amount of s-caprolactone (12.5%) on release of rapamycin; increasing the amount of glycolide increases the rate at which rapamycin is released. EXAMPLE 3 Commercially available stainless steel stents were functionalised, a primer coat applied and overlaid with polymer PLGC1 containing 25% rapamycin in an identical manner to Example 2 Stages 1-5. An “undrugged top coat” of poly(D,L-lactide-coglycolide) 50:50 (PLGA2) was then applied in the following manner. The stents were attached to a mandrel and coated on the Sonotek MediCoat Benchtop Coater with a 0.5% w/w solution in CHCI3 of PLGA2. The parameters used were: 0.09ml/min flow rate, 1.0W ultrasonic power, 2 passes, 40rpm rotation, 0.13cm/s horizontal travel and 25mm from stent to spray head. After coating, the stents were dried under vacuum for 16 hours at 40°C. The top-coat made up 10% of the total coating weight. The elution of rapamycin from the stents was tested in an identical manner to that described in Example 2 Stage 6. The results, shown in Figure 5, show that the use of an undrugged top coat can control and slow the release of rapamycin from the coating. EXAMPLE 4 Polymers PLGC4 and PLGC8 were blended together in CHCI3 in the ratio 60% PLGC4:40% PLGC8 (60/40 PLGC4/8). To this blend was added 25% rapamycin (based on dry weight of polymer i.e. 75% polymer:25% rapamycin). Commercially available stainless steel stents were functionalised, primed and coated with polymer 60/40 PLGC4/8 containing 25% rapamycin in an identical manner to Example 2 Stages 1-5. An undrugged top-coat of 60/40 PLGC4/8 was applied in an identical manner to that described in Example 3. The top-coats made up zero, 10 or 20% of the total coating weight. The elution of rapamycin from the stents was tested in an identical manner to that described in Example 2 Stage 6. The results, shown in Figure 6, show how top-coats of different weights can further control drug release, with greater coating weight reducing the rate of elution of rapamycin. EXAMPLE 5 Polymers PLGC4 and PLGC8 were blended together in CHCI3 with the ratio of PLGC4:PLGC8 varying as follows: 100:0, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, 50:50. To these blends were added 25% rapamycin (based on dry weight of polymer i.e. 75% polymer:25% rapamycin). Commercially available stainless steel stents were functionalised, primed and coated with polymer blends containing 25% rapamycin in an identical manner to Example 2 Stages 1-5. An undrugged top-coat of PLGC4 and PLGC8 blended in the same ratios as their respective main coats was applied in an identical manner to that described in Example 3. The top-coats made up 10% of the total coating weight. The elution of rapamycin from the stents was tested in an identical manner to that described in Example 2 Stage 6. The results, shown in Figure 7, show how blending of the polymers can be used to control the elution profile of the drug. Specifically, in this case, increasing the ratio of PLGC4 in the blend increases the rate of elution of rapamycin. EXAMPLE 6 Polymers PLGC4 and PLGC8 were blended together in CHCI3 with the ratio of PLGC4:PLGC8 varying as follows: 90:0, 80:20. To these blends were added 25% rapamycin (based on dry weight of polymer i.e. 75% polymer:25% rapamycin). Commercially available stainless steel stents were functionalised, primed and coated with polymer blends containing 25% rapamycin in an identical manner to Example 2 Stages 1-5. An undrugged top-coat of PLGC4 was applied in an identical manner to that described in Example 3. The top-coats made up 10% of the total coating weight. The elution of rapamycin from the stents was tested in an identical manner to that described in Example 2 Stage 6. The results, shown in Figure 8, show again how drug release can be controlled by blending of the polymers. EXAMPLE 7 Polymers PLGC1 and PLGC4 were blended with 25% rapamycin and either 0, 0.75, 1.5 or 3% lauric acid (LA) to produce the following compositions: PLGC4 (%) Rapamycin (%) Lauric acid (%) 75 25 0 74.25 25 0.75 73.5 25 1.5 PLGC1 (%) Rapamycin (%) Lauric acid (%) 75 25 0 73.5 25 1.5 72 25 3 Commercially available stainless steel stents were functionalised, primed and coated with the above polymer the blends in an identical manner to Example 2 Stages 1-5. The elution of rapamycin from the stents was tested in an identical manner to that described in Example 2 Stage 6. The results, shown in Figure 9, show that lauric acid can be added to the polymer coatings as a degradation accelerant but has a minimal affect on the rate of release of rapamycin. EXAMPLE 8 Stage 1: Cleaning Stainless steel samples (50mm χ 50mm χ 0.25mm annealed finish) were cleaned by sonication for 15 minutes in a 7.5% w/w solution of aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, rinsing in deionised water, sonication for 15 minutes in 2-propanol and sonication for 15 minutes in deionised water. The samples were then dried at 100°C for 16 hours, followed by drying at 50°C for 30 minutes. Stage 2: Functionalisation 2.5 ml glacial acetic acid solution in toluene (1.0% w/w, 0.4mmol) was added to 200 ml toluene followed by 1.6 ml TMSPEA and mixed. The samples were removed from the 50°C oven and immersed in the solution for 5 minutes. The samples were removed and kept at 50°C for 20 hours. The samples were rinsed in a series of solvents by rotating sequentially for 15 minutes in each of toluene, methanol, deionised water, methanol and deionised water. Finally, the samples were rinsed for 5 minutes in methanol and then dried at 50°C for 2 hours. Anhydrous toluene was added, under nitrogen, into a measuring cylinder being purged with nitrogen. Enough TESPI was added to give a 4% ν/ν solution in toluene. The samples (dried at 50°C for 15 minutes and allowed to cool for two minutes before use) were immersed in the solution on a holder and rotated under nitrogen for 15 minutes. The samples were then rinsed in anhydrous toluene under nitrogen and dried under vacuum for 16 hours. This stage was omitted in half the samples in order to create unfunctionalised control samples for comparison. Stage 3: Applying a primer coat The samples were placed at an angle of approximately 45° and primed with 0.5% w/w PLGA1 solutions in CHCl3. The priming was performed using a handheld'spray gun working at 10 psi from a distance of approximately 15 cm. Between 4 and 8 passes were needed, depending on the speed of movement, to achieve a primer coat weight of between 50 and 100 pg per cm2. The samples were then cured for 16 hours at 100°C. Stage 4: Coating After curing at 100°C, the samples were cooled for 5 minutes and then placed at an angle of approximately 45° and coated with a 0.5% w/w PLGC4 solution in CHCI3. The coating was performed using a handheld spray gun working at 10 psi from a distance of approximately 15 cm. Between 30 and 60 passes were needed, depending on the speed of movement, to achieve a coat weight of 600-700 pg per cm2. The samples were then dried under vacuum at 50°C for 16 hours. Stage 5: Testing The adhesion tests were performed using the Eicometer 110 PATTI (Pneumatic Adhesion Tensile Test Instrument). Prior to testing all samples were glued to a fixed surface to prevent moving during the procedure. An aluminium pull stub is glued to the test surface using acrylic based super glue. The glue is applied to the stub then placed quickly onto the sample. Taking care to keep the stub still, an activator is sprayed directly onto the interface, whilst simultaneously maintaining pressure on the stub. A pulling piston is attached and a pressurised control module applies increasing pressure to the pull stub until it becomes detached from the test surface. The control module registers the maximum pressure (psig) attained which can be converted into MPa or bond strength (POTS). The results, shown in Figure 10, show that functionalising the surface significantly improves the adhesion of the PLGC to the plates'. EXAMPLE 9 Cleaning A commercially available stainless steel stent was cleaned by sonication for 15 minutes in a 7.5% w/w solution of aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, rinsing in deionised water, sonication for 15 minutes in 2-propanol and sonication for 15 minutes in deionised water. The stent was then dried at 100°C for 16 hours, followed by drying at 50°C for 30 minutes. Functionalisation 2.5 ml glacial acetic acid solution in toluene (1.0% w/w, 0.4mmol) was added to 200 ml toluene followed by 1.6 ml TMSPEA and mixed. The stent was removed from the 50°C oven and immersed in the solution for 5 minutes. The stent was removed and kept at 50°C for 20 hours. The stent was rinsed in a series of solvents by rotating sequentially for 15 minutes in each of toluene, methanol, deionised water, methanol and deionised water. Finally, the stent was rinsed for 5 minutes in methanol and then dried at 50°C for 2-hours. Anhydrous toluene was added, under nitrogen, into a measuring cylinder being purged with nitrogen. Enough TESPI was added to give a 4% ν/ν solution in toluene. The stent (dried at 50°C for 15 minutes and allowed to cool for two minutes before use) was immersed in the solution on a holder and rotated under nitrogen for 15 minutes. The stent was then rinsed in anhydrous toluene under nitrogen and dried under vacuum for 16 hours. PLGA coupling The stent was attached to a mandrel and coated with a primer solution containing 0.5% w/w PLGA1 in CHCI3 on a Sonotek MediCoat Benchtop Coater. The parameters used were: 0.075ml/min flow rate, 0.8W ultrasonic power, 4 passes, 40rpm rotation, 0.13cm/s horizontal travel and 25mm from stent to spray head. After priming, the stent was left for 16 hours at 100°C. Coating After cooling for 5 minutes, the stent was attached to a mandrel and coated on the Sonotek MediCoat Benchtop Coater with a 0.5% w/w solution in CHCI3 of PLGC4, PLGC8 and rapamycin (45:30:25). The parameters used were: 0.09ml/min flow rate, 1.0W ultrasonic power, 16 passes, 40rpm rotation, 0.13cm/s horizontal travel and 25mm from stent to spray head. After.coating, the stent was dried under vacuum for 16 hours at 40°C. Top coat After cooling for 5 minutes, the stent was attached to a mandrel and coated on the Sonotek MediCoat Benchtop Coater with a 0.5% w/w solution in CHCI3 of PLGC4 and PLGC8 (60:40). The parameters used were: 0.09ml/min flow rate, 1.0W ultrasonic power, 2 passes, 40rpm rotation, 0.13cm/s horizontal travel and 25mm from stent to spray head. After coating, the stent was dried under vacuum for 16 hours at 40°C. Tracking and deployment The stent was placed onto the balloon section of a suitably sized commercially available PTCA catheter and crimped by hand. The catheter was fed down a tortuous path in PBS solution at 37°C to mimic the passage of the stent and catheter in the human arteries. This was repeated five times. Finally, the stent was expanded at the nominal pressure of the device (10 bar). The expanded stent was rinsed in deionised water, dried and observed' under an optical microscope. No pitting, cracking or delamination of the coating was observed (see Figure 11), including at the expansion points of the stent struts. EXAMPLE 10 Polymers were prepared following the same methods as described in Example 1 using the ratios of lactide, glycolide and s-caprolactone shown below: Ref Code Composition (%) Lactide Glycolide Caprolactone PLGC21 77.5 10 12.5 PLGC22 75 10 15 PLGC23 76.75 10 13.25 Stents were cleaned, functionalised and a primer coat of PLGA1 applied as described in Example 2 Stages 1-3. The stents were then coated with polymers PLGC21, PLGC22 and PLGC23 containing 25% rapamycin as described in Example 2, Stages 4 and 5. The elution of rapamycin from the stents was tested in an identical manner to that described in Example 2, Stage 6. The results, shown in Figure 12, show that the upturn in release caused by the onset of degradation can be delayed, and drug can be released over a longer timescale, with a lower glycolide content. Furthermore for a constant glycolide content, drug release can be extended by lowering the caprolactone content. In this example drug release can be extended to around 1000 hours (42 days). Overall, the system described can be designed to tailor drug release profiles between about 100 and 1000 hours with a reasonably consistent rate of drug release. 1.
