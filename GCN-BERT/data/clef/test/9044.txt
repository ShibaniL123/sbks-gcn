FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to nutrition for infants, in particular infant formulae, comprising non-digestible oligosaccharides to improve intestinal health in infants or small children, in particular for improving the health of the small intestine. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Breast-feeding is the preferred method of feeding infants. However, there are circumstances that make breast-feeding impossible or less desirable. In those cases infant formulae are a good alternative. The composition of modern infant formulae is adapted in such a way that it meets many of the special nutritional requirements of the fast growing and developing infant. Still further improvements can be made. Human milk comprises non-digestible oligosaccharides which represent, after lactose and lipids, the third largest fraction, of which the concentration, dependent on the Lewis blood group of the mother and the stage of lactation, can range from about 7.5 to 15 g/liter for mature human milk. The human milk oligosaccharides remain undigested in the small intestine and enter the colon where they stimulate the formation of a microbiota rich in Bifidobacteria and influence the physiology of the colon, such as the formation of organic acids, the formation of mucins, decreasing the pH, and effecting the barrier function. Infant formulae with non-digestible oligosaccharides, in particular a mixture of short chain galacto-oligosaccharides and long chain fructo-oligosaccharides in a 9 to 1 weight ratio, are known to beneficially effect the colonic microbiota, formation of mucin the physiology of the colon and the immune system, including effects against food allergy and atopic dermatitis. However, little is known on the direct effect of such non-digestible oligosaccharides on the physiology of the small intestine and the health effects resulting thereof. Especially in young infants having an immature small intestine, if such effects are found, theses may be very relevant. EP2219672 discloses the use of galacto-oligosaccharides and polyfructose for the increase of the intestinal barrier functioning and/or mucus production of the large intetstine. EP1815755 discloses the use of long and short chain oligosaccharides for stimulating the mucus production in different parts of the ileum and the colon. WO 2010/008278 discloses the use of probiotic bacteria and preferably dietary fibers in patients with a motility disorder to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, and small bowel overgrowth. Barnes et al, 2012, JPEN, 36 :524-37 discloses that treatment with short chain fructo-oligosaccharide increased ileal mucosa weight, protein and villus height in piglets. However, Shim et al, 2005, Acta Agriculturae Scandinavica, 55 :91-97 found no such effects on villus height in the small intestine when two different fructo-oligosaccharides concentrations were tested in piglets. In Houdijk et al, 1999, J Animal Sci. 77 :148-158 the effect of a long term diet with non digestible oligosaccharides on apparent ileal and total tract nutrient digestion by pigs was disclosed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Employing an animal model with canulated piglets, the inventors found that the presence of non-digestible oligosaccharides (NDO) in the nutritional composition at a concentration of at least 2 wt. % based on dry weight of the nutritional composition and/or at least 0.4 g based on 100 ml of the nutritional composition increased the volume of the luminal fluid inside the small intestine. Below this concentration, such effect was not observed. It was found to be a direct effect of the NDO, since the role of microbiota or short chain fatty acids (SCFA) indicated by a change in pH, was found to be absent. It was also found to be an acute effect and not an effect on the development of the intestine such as increasing the villus height, or ileal mucosa tissue, as the piglets were exposed to the nutritional composition only for one day. This effect of non digestible oligosaccharides on the small intestine beneficially mimics the situation in breast fed infants and has an advantageous effect of the small intestinal health by diluting toxins, pathogenic micro-organisms and protease activity (e.g. trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase activity). Exposure of the small intestine to toxic compounds, pathogens or endogenous proteases (such as digestive proteases) can result in epithelial damage, infections, or increased pain perception and/or impaired barrier function via the activation of PAR2 receptors. This can have a negative effect on gastrointestinal health and the incidence of infections and inflammation. Hence beneficial effects on intestinal health comfort will occur, especially in young infants, since their small intestine is not yet fully developed, when non-digestible oligosaccharides are administered above the threshold concentration.

The amount of nutritional composition administered per day is preferably between 50 and 2000 ml, more preferably between 200 and 1500, most preferably between 400 and 1000 ml. Preferably the nutritional composition has an osmolality below 500 mOsmol/kg, more preferably below 450. Preferably the osmolality is above 150. A too high osmolality or too low osmolality will disadvantageously effect the volume of the fluid in the lumen inside the small intestine. Application The present nutritional composition for the present method or use is specifically intended for human subjects, preferably for infants and/or toddlers. Infants have an age of 0-12 months, toddlers have an age of 12-36 months. More preferably it is intended for infants with an age of 0 to 6 months. In such young subjects the small intestine is immature and under development. Therefore the present beneficial effects on the small intestine health are especially important in this target group. In one embodiment of the method or use or nutritional composition for use according to the present invention, the nutritional composition is for providing nutrition to infants and/or toddlers. The present nutritional composition is preferably enterally administered, more preferably orally. The present nutritional composition can advantageously be applied as a complete nutrition for infants. The present nutritional composition preferably comprises lipid, protein, and carbohydrate and is preferably administered in liquid form. The present nutritional composition is preferably a nutritional formula, preferably an infant formula or follow on formula. International directives are known regarding the composition of such infant formula or follow on formula. The present invention includes dry nutritional compositions, e.g. powders, which are accompanied with instructions as to admix said dry compositions, in particular nutritional formula, with a suitable liquid, e.g. water. Thus in one embodiment of the method or use or nutritional composition for use according to the present invention, the nutritional composition is in liquid form or in the form of a powder suitable to be reconstituted to a with water. Employing an animal model with canulated piglets, the inventors found that the presence of non-digestible oligosaccharides (NDO) in the nutritional composition at a concentration of at least 2 wt. % based on dry weight of the nutritional composition and/or at least 0.4 g based on 100 ml of the nutritional composition increased the volume of the luminal fluid inside the small intestine. Below this concentration, such effect was not observed. It was found to be a direct effect of the NDO, since the role of microbiota or SCFA indicated by a change in pH, was absent. It was also found to be an acute effects and not an effect on the development of the intestine such as increasing the villus height, or ileal mucosa tissue, as the piglets were exposed to the nutritional compositions only for one day. This effect of non digestible oligosaccharides on the small intestine beneficially mimics the situation in breast fed infants and has an advantageous effect of the small intestinal health by diluting toxins, pathogenic micro-organisms and protease activity (e.g. trypsin, chymotrypsin and elastase activity). Exposure of the small intestine to toxic compounds, pathogens or endogenous proteases (such as digestive proteases) can result in epithelial damage, infections, or increased pain perception and/or impaired barrier function via the activation of PAR2 receptors. This can have a negative effect on gastrointestinal health and the incidence of infections and inflammation. Hence beneficial effects on intestinal health comfort, preferably small intestinal health, will occur, especially in young infants, since their small intestine is not yet fully developed, when non-digestible oligosaccharides are administered above the threshold concentration. So the present nutritional compositions is preferably for use in increasing the luminal fluid volume inside the small intestine of a subject. With this effect intestinal health is improved, so in a preferred embodiment, the nutritional compositions is for use in improving intestinal health. Increasing the luminal fluid volume inside the small intestine of a subject has the further advantage that luminal protease activity or density in the intestine can be decreased, that small bowel bacterial overgrowth can be prevented, that gastro-intestinal transit time can be increased, and/or that the activity of toxins in the intestine can be decreased. So in one embodiment, the present nutritional compositions is preferably for use in decreasing luminal protease activity or density in the intestine of the subject, for use in treating and/or preventing small bowel bacterial overgrowth in the subject, for use in increasing gastro-intestinal transit time in the subject and/or for use in decreasing the activity of toxins in the intestine of the subject. In one embodiment, the use in increasing the luminal fluid volume inside the small intestine of a subject is a non-medical use. In a preferred embodiment the non-medical use, or non medical method according to the invention, is for decreasing luminal protease activity or density in the intestine of the subject and/or for increasing gastro-intestinal transit time in the subject. EXAMPLES Example 1 Infant Formula with Non Digestible Oligosaccharides Increases Intestinal Volume in Piglets Eighteen age- and weight-matched (Piétrain X (Large white X Landrace)) male piglets (mean BW 5.1±0.03 kg) were selected 14 days after birth from 8 different litters. The piglets were individually housed in a temperature-controlled room maintained at 28° C. At day 26 the piglets were operated on to receive a T-cannula at the distal end of the terminal ileum after overnight fasting. The piglets were allowed to recover for 7 days before the start of the experiment. Six diets were tested in the piglets. The diets were dissolved in demineralized water (37° C.) with a final dry matter content of 20% (w/v). Diet 1 was an infant formula comprising short chain trans-galacto-oligosaccharides GOS2 (beta linked, mainly beta 1,3 linked) in a concentration of 1.0 wt % based on dry weight of the total composition and 0.2 g per 100 ml. The osmolality of the formula was 453±2.4 mOsm/kg. Diet 2 was a infant formula without non-digestible oligosaccharides. The osmolality of the formula was 421±23.1 mOsm/kg. Diet 3 was an infant formula comprising non-digestible oligosaccharides in a concentration of 5.7 wt % based on dry weight of the total composition and 1.14 g per 100 ml, in form of a mixture of 9:1 wt/wt short chain transgalacto-oligosaccharide GOS1 (source Vivinal GOS, FrieslandCampina DOMO, beta linked, which has mainly beta 1,4 and beta 1,6 linkages) and long chain fructo-oligosaccharides (RaftilinHP, Orafti). The osmolality of the formula was 467±4.3 mOsm/kg. Diet 4 was an infant formula comprising the same non-digestible oligosaccharides as in diet 1, but at a concentration of 0.5 wt % based on dry weight of the total composition and 0.1 g per 100 ml. The osmolality of the formula was 427±1.5 mOsm/kg. Diet 5 was an infant formula comprising non-digestible oligosaccharides of diet 3 and 4, at a total concentration of 6.2 wt % based on dry weight of the total composition and 1.24 g per 100 ml. The osmolality of the formula was 481±3.6 mOsm/kg. The osmolality of the diets was not significantly different. It should be noted that due to the EU directives the non-digestible disaccharides in the GOS1 or GOS2 do not qualify as dietary fiber. Hence the fiber content on an infant formula may be labeled lower. For further details see Table 1. From birth until day 14 the piglets remained with the sow and received sow's milk only. From day 14 until the start of the cannula experiment (day 33), the piglets received a mixture of the diets ad-libitum via an automatic computer-controlled feeding system. For proper growth, the piglets started with 8 feedings a day after which the number of meals was progressively decreased to 4 meals a day from day 21 onwards at 7.00 am, 10.00 am, 13.00 pm and 16.00 pm. During the cannula experiment (day 33 to 44), twelve piglets received the individual diets for 2 days according to a Latin Square design at 7.00 am, 10.00 am, 13.00 pm and 16.00 pm. The piglets received 1400 kJ per kg body weight (metabolic weight). Piglets were weighed before changing diets at day 33, 35, 37, 39, 41 and 43. Chromium oxide (0.25 g/kg) was added to the IF powder as an indigestible, internal standard to measure the amount of digesta flowed into the ileal collection bags.

The digesta was collected 2-hourly in small bags that were emptied immediately when filled and stored on ice. All samples were stored at −80° C. until further processing. Dry matter (DM) (gravimetry at 80° C.), chromium oxide (Cr) (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry), and crude protein (CP) (Kjeldahl method, N×6.25) were analyzed in freeze-dried digesta samples and diet powders. Total proteolytic activity in the ileal digesta was determined using the EnzCheck protease 25 fluorescence based assay kit (E6638, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., USA) for detecting metallo-, serine and sulfhydryl proteases. Porcine pancreatin (Sigma, P1750) was used to prepare a calibration curve. Activity is expressed as arbitrary unit (AU) (based on pancreatin activity in USP). Trypsin activity was measured by using N-Benzoyl-L-Arginne Ethyl Ester (BAEE, Sigma B4500) as substrate and measuring the absorbance change at 25 oC 253 nm (according to the 5 manufacturer's instructions). Bovine trypsin (Sigma, T9201) was used to prepare a calibration curve. Activity is expressed as arbitrary unit (AU) (based on trypsin activity in U). Chymotrypsin was measured by using N-Benzoyl-L-Tyrosine Ethyl Ester (BTEE, Sigma B6125) as substrate and measuring the absorbance change at 25 oC at 256 nm. Bovine 10 chymotrypsin (Sigma, C3142) was used to prepare a calibration curve. Activity is expressed as arbitrary unit (AU) (based on chymotrypsin activity in U). Elastase activity was measured by using SucAla3-PNA (S4760, Sigma) as substrate and porcine elastase (E7885, Sigma) was used to prepare a calibration curve. Activity is expressed as arbitrary unit (AU) (based on elastase activity in U). The results were analyzed using Univariate Analysis of Variance (GLM procedure). Differences between diets were considered significant with p<0.05 according to the LSD test. The results in Table 2 show that ileal digesta volume is significantly increased after ingesting diet 3 or 5 containing a higher concentration of NDO, when compared with the control diets (diet 2). Strikingly only above a certain threshold amount of NDO this effect was observed, since with diet 1 and 4 no significant difference in intestinal volume was observed compared with diet 2 comprising no NDO. No effect was observed on the pH of the terminal ileum. This is indicative for the absence of a role of fermentation of the non-digestible oligosaccharides by the intestinal microbiota (located in the colon) and therefore a direct effect of the non-digestible oligosaccharides in the colon. The osmolality was lower in diet 3 and 5 compared to the diet 2 without NDO. The values of diet 1, and 4 were intermediate, but not statistically significantly different from diet 3, 5 and 2. The concentration of proteins was lower, i.e. more diluted, in the digesta of piglets fed a diet 3 and 5 containing NDO when compared to diet 2. Diet 1 showed an intermediate and statistically significant effect in this respect. Most interestingly, the density of protease activity was lower, i.e. more diluted, in the digesta of piglets fed a diet 3 and 5 containing NDO when compared to diet 2. Diet land 4 showed an intermediate effect, but were not statistically significantly different from the diet without NDO (diet 2) in this respect. Looking at the major digestive enzymes of the intestine chymotrypsin and trypsin, diet 3 and 5 showed a more diluted activity versus diet 2, whereas the diluted activity in diet 1 and 4 was not statistically different from diet 2.
