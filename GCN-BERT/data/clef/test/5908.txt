Modified J-Chain Cross-Reference to Related Applications This application claims priority and the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/974,738, filed April 3, 2014, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Field of the Invention The present invention concerns modified recombinant J-chain polypeptides and binding molecules, such as antibodies comprising the same. Background of the Invention J-chain is an acidic 15-kDa polypeptide, which is associated with pentameric IgM and dimeric IgA via disulfide bonds involving the penultimate cysteine residue in the 18-amino acid secretory tail-piece (tp) at the C-terminus of the IgM μ or IgA a heavy chain. The three disulfide bridges are formed between Cys 12 and 100, Cys 71 and 91, and Cys 108 and 133, respectively. See, e.g. Frutiger et al. 1992, Biochemistry 31, 12643-12647. Structural requirements for incorporation of the J-chain into human IgM and IgA and for polymeric immunoglobulin assembly and association with the J-chain are reported by Sorensen et al. 2000, Int. Immunol. 12(1): 19-27 and Yoo et al. 1999, J. Biol. Chem. 274(47):33771-33777, respectively. Recombinant production of soluble J-chain in E coli is reported by Redwan et al. 2006, Human Antibodies 15:95-102. Methods for making hybrid IgA/IgG and IgM/IgG antibodies are known in the art. Thus, recombinant production of hybrid IgA2/IgGl antibodies is reported in Chintalacharuvu et al. 2001, Clin Immunol 101(1):21-31. It has been reported that addition of atp or μίρ at the end of IgG γ heavy chain facilitates polymerization and enhances effector function such as complement activation (Smith et al, J Immunol 1995, 154:2226-2236). The IgA/IgG hybrid antibodies possess properties of both IgA and IgG. Despite the advances made in the design of antibodies, there remains a need for modified antibodies with improved properties, such as improved affinity, specificity and/or avidity. As the field has progressed, antibody function has been enhanced through creative means of protein engineering, such as to provide higher affinity, longer half-life, and/or better tissue distribution, as well as combination of small and large molecule technologies for increased focus of cell destruction via toxic payload delivery (e.g. antibody-drug conjugates). Another approach to improving antibody function takes advantage of the bivalent binding of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) structure which allows one IgG molecule to bind two antigens. Indeed, in certain applications, there exists good potential for asymmetric antibodies to exert useful functions by simultaneously binding two different target antigens. To address this need, a variety of constructs have been produced to yield a single molecule that can bind two different antigens, allowing for functions never before seen in nature. An example of this bispecific approach is "blinatumomab" (MT103 or AMG103) which binds the CD3 and CD 19 receptors, on T- and B-cells, respectively. This tethering of a cytotoxic T-cell to a cancerous B-cell, allows for effective treatment of B-cell leukemia. However, there remain significant technical difficulties in construction, expression and production of bispecific antibodies. Although bispecific antibodies are regarded as promising therapeutic agents due to their ability to simultaneously bind two different antigens, their utility is limited due to problems with stability and manufacturing complexity. Various forms of protein engineering have been used to match heterologous heavy chains, plus appropriate pair- wise matching of heavy and light chains to efficiently yield a bispecific IgG. In addition, various bispecific antibody formats, including quadromas, chemical heteroconjugates, recombinant constructs using selected heterodimerization domains and recombinant constructs of minimal size consisting of two minimal antigen-binding sites. However, all of these efforts have been fraught with difficulty. Thus, despite efforts directed toward the development of engineered, such as bispecific, antibodies, there remains a great need for developing more efficient platforms. This is particularly true in the case of therapeutic antibodies, where the design and production of new, modified, antibodies and antibody-like molecules with multiple specificities can shorten the timeline between discovery and clinical introduction of such therapeutics. Summary of the Invention The present invention is based, at least in part, on the recognition that the J-chain of an IgM or IgA antibody can be modified by introducing one or more binding moieties into a native J-chain sequence, and the modified J-chain can be introduced into IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM or IgG/lgA antibodies without compromising the functionality of the recipient antibody or the binding of the modified J-chain to its target. This allows the modified J-chain with binding moiety to interact with one set of target antigens, while the IgA, IgM, IgG/IgM or IgG/ IgA antibody can react with a different set of target antigens. The invention is further based on the recognition that by directing the modified J-chain to an effector cell, such as a T-cell, NK-cell, macrophage or neutrophil, the immune response of the body can be activated, and the antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) response can be improved. In one aspect, the present invention concerns a modified J-chain comprising an extraneous binding moiety introduced into a native sequence J-chain. In one embodiment, the native sequence J-chain is the native human J-chain sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a functional fragment thereof. In another embodiment, the extraneous binding moiety is introduced into the native human J-chain sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 by direct or indirect fusion. In yet another embodiment, binding moiety is introduced by indirect fusion through a peptide linker. In one embodiment, the indirect fusion is accomplished through a peptide linker at or around the C- and/or N-terminus of the binding moiety. In another embodiment, the extraneous binding moiety is introduced into the native human J-chain sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 at or around the C-terminus and/or the N-terminus, such as within about 10 residues from the C-terminus and/or the N-terminus. In a further embodiment, the extraneous binding moiety is introduced into the native human J-chain sequence in between cysteine residues 92 and 101 of SEQ ID NO: 1. In a still further embodiment, the extraneous binding moiety is introduced into the native human J-chain sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 at or near a glycosylation site. The peptide linker, if present, may, for example, be about 10 to 20 amino acids long, or about 15 to 20 amino acids long, or 15 amino acids long. In a further embodiment, the extraneous binding moiety is introduced into the native human J-chain sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 by chemical or chemo-enzymatic derivatization. The chemical linker may be a cleavable or a non-cleavable linker, where the cleavable linker may, for example, be a chemically labile linker or an enzyme-labile linker.

In a different embodiment, the J-chain is modified by insertion of an enzyme recognition site, and by post-translationally attaching an extraneous binding moiety at the enzyme recognition site through a peptide or non-peptide linker. In all embodiments, the extraneous binding moiety may, for example, be selected from the group consisting of antibodies, antigen-binding fragments of antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, antibody-like molecules, antigen-binding fragments of antibody-like molecules, soluble and membrane-bound proteins, ligands, receptors, virus-like particles, protein toxins, enzymes, and alternative scaffolds.

Typical antigen-binding fragments include F(ab')2, F(ab)2, Fab', Fab, Fv, scFv, and single domain antibodies. In a preferred embodiment, the antigen-binding fragment is scFv. In one embodiment, the extraneous binding moiety of the modified J-chain binds to an effector cell, where the effector cell may, for example, be selected from the group consisting of T-cells, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and neutrophils. In one embodiment, the effector cell is a T-cell, where the extraneous binding moiety may, for example, bind to CD3s on the T-cell. In another embodiment, the effector cell is an NK cell, where the target for the extraneous binding moiety of the modified J-chain may, for example be selected from the group consisting of CD 16, CD64 and NKG2D on the NK cell. Iln a yet another embodiment, the effector cell is a macrophage, where the extraneous binding moiety of the modified J-chain may, for example, bind to CD 14 on the macrophage.

FIG. 6: An IgM antibody lacking its J-chain (negative control) and IgM comprising a J-chain were separated on reducing SDS PAGE and detected by Western Blot using an anti-J- chain antibody. The anti- J-chain antibody only reacted with the IgM comprising a J-chain. FIG. 7: Harvested supernatant from transfected CHO cells were divided equally for immunoprecipitation with either anti-mu or anti-myc affinity matrix. These CHO cells were expressing an IgM with anti-B cells specificity known as CDIM (for cell death inducing molecule). This IgM antibody is known as IGM-55.5. The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on reducing SDS PAGE and detected by Western Blot by anti-J or anti-myc antibodies. Both N-terminal tagged anti-CD3scFvJ and C-terminal tagged J-antiCD3scFv transfected cells displayed a positive band around 51 kD, which reacted to both anti-J and anti-myc antibodies. FIG. 8 illustrates two different orientations of a bis-specific IgM pentamer comprising a modified J-chain with binding specificity for a T-cell (the T-cell antigen CD3).

FIG. 10: Sequence (SEQ ID NO: 47) and structure an anti-CD3 single-chain Fv comprising a J-chain at the N-terminus (J-antiCD3scFv). SP=signal peptide. FIG. 11 is a schematic illustration of an asymmetric bi-specific IgM pentamer with binding-specificity for a target antigen, comprising a binding domain covalently attached to the J-chain with binding specificity for an effector cell. FIG. 12 shows Western blots of an anti-CD20 IgM pentamer with a J-chain covalently modified with an CD3 scFv binding domain. Non-reducing PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue observes the full size of IgM: approximately 1 million daltons MW. The modified J-chain incorporates into the IgM pentamers in both orientations: CD3-J and J-CD3. FIG. 13 shows the results of transient co-transfections of the heavy chain (HC), light chain (LC), and modified J-chain of a bispecific anti-CD20 IgM (CD20igM) with a modified J- chain providing binding specificity to CD3 (CD3j). FIG. 14 shows that incorporation of a modified J-chain into an anti-CD20 IgM has no negative effect on CDC activity. In addition, the data show that an IgM molecule comprising a modified J-chain in either orientation (V15J or J15V, where "15" designates the length of the linker) is significantly more potent than an anti-CD20 IgG antibody. FIG. 15 shows that a bispecific CD20igM x CD3j_chain molecule is highly potent at B- cell depletion as a result of active T-cell killing of B-cells due to the CD3 -specificity of the modified J-chain. Raji, a CD19+CD20+ B cell line, was co-cultured with T-ALL, a CD8+ Cytolytic T cell line) with CD20 IgM x J-wild-type or CD20 IgM x CD3-J chain for 24 hours at 37 degrees, 5% C02. Cell were harvested and stained with fluorescent antibodies to CD3 and CD 19 and analyzed by flow cytometry to assess viable B cells. FIG. 16 shows that a bispecific anti-CD20 IgM molecule with a modified J-chain providing binding specificity to CD3 has significantly improved cytotoxic activity over an anti-CD20 IgM pentamer with wild-type J-chain. The T-cell engaging bispecific IgM pentamer is effective at a concentration of 1 ng/ml, and is 300-times more potent compared to anti-CD20 IgM with wild-type J-chain. FIG. 17 shows in vivo B-cell depletion with anti-CD20 IgG, IgM and bispecific IgM. Humanized NSG mice reconstituted with human CD34+ stem cells (Jackson Laboratory; Stock Number: 007799) were purchased and whole blood was analyzed for pre-dose levels of CD 19+ B cells. CD20 IgM x CD3-J chain was prepared for intravenous dosing animals at 0.5mg/kg. Following 6 hours after dosing, whole blood was obtained from animals and analyzed by flow cytometry for circulating levels of human B cells using a fluorescently labeled CD 19+ antibody. FIG. 18 is a Western blot of a CD 16 specific Vhh came lid- J-chain. FIG. 19 lists IgM antibody targets and effector cell targets for a modified J-chain. Any of the IgM antibody targets listed in the left column of the table can be combined with any of the modified J-chain targets listed in the right column. Detailed Description of the Invention I. Definitions Before the present invention is described in greater detail, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular embodiments described, as such may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present invention will be limited only by the appended claims. Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that each intervening value, to the tenth of the unit of the lower limit unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, between the upper and lower limit of that range and any other stated or intervening value in that stated range is encompassed within the invention. The upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges may independently be included in the smaller ranges encompassed within the invention, subject to any specifically excluded limit in the stated range. Unless defined otherwise, technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Singleton et al., Dictionary of Microbiology and Molecular Biology 2nd ed., J. Wiley & Sons (New York, NY 1994), provides one skilled in the art with a general guide to many of the terms used in the present application. All publications mentioned herein are expressly incorporated herein by reference to disclose and describe the methods and/or materials in connection with which the publications are cited. The term "antibody" includes monoclonal antibodies (including full length antibodies which have an immunoglobulin Fc region), single-chain molecules, as well as antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, F(ab')2, and Fv). The term "immunoglobulin" (Ig) is used interchangeably with "antibody" herein. The basic 4-chain antibody unit is a heterotetrameric glycoprotein composed of two identical light (L) chains and two identical heavy (H) chains. Unless noted otherwise, the term "antibody" is used herein in the broadest sense and specifically includes all isotypes, sub-classes and forms of antibodies, including IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD, and IgE antibodies and their fragments, preferably antigen-binding fragments. Preferred antibodies herein include IgM and IgA antibodies and their antigen-binding fragments, which may be modified to include sequences from other isotypes, such as IgG to produce chimeric antibodies. In the case of IgGs, the 4-chain unit is generally about 150,000 daltons. Each L chain is linked to an H chain by one covalent disulfide bond, while the two H chains are linked to each other by one or more disulfide bonds depending on the H chain isotype. Each H and L chain also has regularly spaced intrachain disulfide bridges. Each H chain has at the N- terminus, a variable domain (VH) followed by three constant domains (CH) for each of the a and γ chains and four CH domains for μ and ε isotypes. Each L chain has at the N-terminus, a variable domain (VL) followed by a constant domain at its other end. The VL is aligned with the VH and the CL is aligned with the first constant domain of the heavy chain (CHI). Particular amino acid residues are believed to form an interface between the light chain and heavy chain variable domains. The pairing of a VH and VL together forms a single antigen-binding site. IgM is a glycoprotein which forms polymers where multiple immunoglobulins are covalently linked together with disufide bonds. IgM mostly exists as a pentamer but also as a hexamer and therefore contains 10 or 12 antigen binding sites. The pentameric form typically contains an additional polypeptide, called the J-chain, but can also be made in the absence of J-chain. The pentameric IgM molecule has a molecular weight of approximately 970 kDa. Due to its polymeric nature, IgM possesses high avidity and is particularly effective in complement activation. Unlike in IgG, the heavy chain in IgM monomers is composed of one variable and four constant domains. The IgM constant domains are designated herein as CM1 or Ομΐ, CM2 or Cμ2, CM3 or Cμ3, and CM4 or Cμ4, wherein the "CM" and Cμ" designations are used interchangeably. The structure of an IgM pentamer is illustrated in FIG. 1. The term "IgM" is used herein in the broadest sense and specifically includes mono-, and multi-specific (including bispecific) IgM molecules, such as, for example, the multi- specific IgM binding molecules disclosed in PCT Application No. PCT/US2014/054079, the entire disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein. The term "IgM binding unit" or "IgM antibody binding unit" is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers an IgM antibody heavy chain constant region polypeptide, comprising at least a CM4 constant domain, fused to a variable domain sequence (VH) binding to a target (e.g. antigen), with or without an associated antibody light chain variable domain (VL) sequence. The term "bispecific IgM binding unit" or "bispecific IgM antibody binding unit" is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers a pair of IgM antibody heavy chain constant region polypeptides, comprising at least a CM4 constant domain, fused to a variable domain sequence (VH), each variable domain sequence binding to a different target, with or without associated antibody light chain variable domain (VL) sequences. In one embodiment, the bispecific IgM antibody comprises two VHVL antigen binding regions, each capable of binding to a different epitope on one antigen or epitopes on two different antigens. The bispecific IgM antibody binding units can be full length from a single species, or be chimerized or humanized. The bispecific IgM antibodies of the present invention have a penta- or hexameric ring structure comprising five or six bispecific IgM binding units. The term "multi-specific IgM" is used herein in the broadest sense to refer to IgM antibodies with two or more binding specificities. Thus, the term "multi-specific" includes "bispecific", e.g. bispecific antibodies or bispecific binding units, including IgM pentamers comprising at least two monospecific subunits, each binding to a different antigen (AA, BB), or five or six bispecific subunits, each binding to two different antigens (AB, AB). Thus, the bispecific and multi-specific IgM pentamers may include five identical bispecific binding units, monospecific IgM binding units, at least two of them have different binding specificities, or any combination thereof. A "full length IgM antibody heavy chain" is a polypeptide consisting in N-terminal to C-terminal direction of an antibody heavy chain variable domain (VH), an antibody constant heavy chain constant domain 1 (CM1 or Cμl), an antibody heavy chain constant domain 2 (CM2 or Cμ2), an antibody heavy chain constant domain 3 (CM3 or Cμ3), and an antibody heavy chain constant domain 4 (CM4 or Cμ4). The bispecific full length IgM antibodies as defined herein comprise five or six monomers (binding units), each with two antigen binding sites, which specifically bind to two different binding targets (epitopes). The C-terminus of the heavy or light chain of the full length antibody denotes the last amino acid at the C-terminus of the heavy or light chain. The N-terminus of the heavy or light chain of the full length antibody denotes the first amino acid at the N-terminus of the heavy or light chain. Native IgA is a tetrameric protein comprising two identical light chains (κ or λ) and two identical heavy chains (a). In the human, there are two IgA isotypes, IgAl and IgA2. IgA, similarly to IgG, contains three constant domains (CA1-CA3 or Cal-Ca3), with a hinge region between the Cal and Ca2 domains, wherein the "CA" and "Ca" designations are used interchangeably. All IgA isotypes have an 18 amino acid "tailpiece", which is located C- terminal to the Ca3 domain, which enables polymeric Ig formation (see, e.g. Garcia-Pardo et al, 1981, J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11734-11738 and Davis et al, 1988, Eur. J. Immunol. 18, 1001- 1008). Serum IgA is a monomer but can also polymerize. In its secretory form IgA comprises from 2-5 of the basic 4-chain units, linked by a j-chain, which may include a tail- piece, and may be associated by a secretory component. The structures of tail-piece, dimeric IgA and secretory IgA, associated with a secretory component (slgA) are illustrated in FIG. 2. IgA antibodies can be further divided into IgAl and IgA2 sub-classes. The term "IgA" antibody is used herein to specifically include all sub-classes, i.e. IgAl and IgA2 antibodies, including dimeric and multimeric forms, with and without a secretory component, as well as fragments, preferably antigen-binding fragments, of such antibodies. For the purposes of the present invention, the IgA antibody preferably is a dimer, where two tail-pieces are connected by a J-chain (see, FIG. 2). The term "IgA" is used herein in the broadest sense and specifically includes mono-, and multi-specific IgA molecules, such as, for example, the multi-specific IgA binding molecules disclosed in PCT Application No. PCT/US2015/015268, the entire disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein. The term "multi-specific IgA" is used herein in the broadest sense to refer to IgA antibodies with two or more binding specificities. Thus, the term "multi-specific" includes "bispecific", e.g. bispecific antibodies or bispecific binding units, including IgA dimers comprising two monospecific subunits, each binding to a different antigen (AA, BB), or two bispecific subunits, each binding to two different antigens (AB, AB). In one embodiment, the dimeric multi-specific IgA molecules consist of two monospecific binding units, each binding unit having binding specificity to a different binding target (AA, BB). In another embodiment, in the dimeric IgA molecules at least one of the two binding units has two different binding specificities (i.e. is a bispecific, e.g. AA, A,B or AA, BC). In another embodiment, each of the two binding units has two specificities, which may be the same (AB, AB) or different (AC, CD or AB, AC, for example). The term "bispecific IgA antibody binding unit" is used in the broadest sense and specifically covers a pair of IgA antibody heavy chain constant region polypeptides, comprising at least a CA3 constant domain, fused to a variable domain sequence (VH), each variable domain sequence binding to a different target, with or without associated antibody light chain variable domain (VL) sequences. In one embodiment, the bispecific IgA antibody comprises two VHVL antigen binding regions, each capable of binding to a different epitope on one antigen or epitopes on two different antigens. The bispecific IgA antibody binding units can be full length from a single species, or be chimerized or humanized. A "full length IgA antibody heavy chain" is a polypeptide consisting in N-terminal to C-terminal direction of an antibody heavy chain variable domain (VH), an antibody constant heavy chain constant domain 1 (CA1 or Cal), an antibody constant heavy chain constant domain 2 (CA2 or Ca2), and an antibody heavy chain constant domain 3 (CA3 or Ca3). The bi- or multi-specific full length IgA antibodies according to the invention comprise two monomers (binding units), each of which may be mono- or bispecific, with or without a secretory component. Thus, the multi-specific IgA antibodies of the present invention may include monospecific and bispecific binding units, provided that the resultant IgA antibody has at least two binding specificities. The C-terminus of the heavy or light chain of the full length antibody denotes the last amino acid at the C-terminus of the heavy or light chain. The N-terminus of the heavy or light chain of the full length antibody denotes the first amino acid at the N-terminus of the heavy or light chain. For further details of the structure and properties of the different classes of antibodies, see e.g., Basic and Clinical Immunology, 8th Edition, Daniel P. Stites, Abba I. Terr and Tristram G. Parslow (eds), Appleton & Lange, Norwalk, Conn., 1994, page 71 and Chapter 6. The term "interface", as used herein, is used to refer to a region, which comprises those "contact" amino acid residues (or other non-amino acid groups such as, for example, carbohydrate groups,) in a first IgM heavy chain constant region which interact with one or more "contact" amino acid residues (or other non-amino acid groups) in a second IgM heavy chain constant region. The term "asymmetric interface" is used to refer to an interface (as hereinabove defined) formed between two antibody chains, such as a first and a second IgM heavy chain constant region and/or between an IgM heavy chain constant region and its matching light chain, wherein the contact residues in the first and the second chains are different by design, comprising complementary contact residues. The asymmetric interface can be created by knobs/holes interactions and/or salt bridges coupling (charge swaps) and/or other techniques known in the art, such as for example, by the CrossMab approach for coupling a μ heavy chain to its matching light chain. A "cavity" or "hole" refers to at least one amino acid side chain which is recessed from the interface of the second polypeptide and therefore accommodates a corresponding protuberance ("knob") on the adjacent interface of the first polypeptide. The cavity (hole) may exist in the original interface or may be introduced synthetically (e.g. by altering nucleic acid encoding the interface). Normally, nucleic acid encoding the interface of the second polypeptide is altered to encode the cavity. To achieve this, the nucleic acid encoding at least one "original" amino acid residue in the interface of the second polypeptide is replaced with DNA encoding at least one "import" amino acid residue which has a smaller side chain volume than the original amino acid residue. It will be appreciated that there can be more than one original and corresponding import residue. The upper limit for the number of original residues which are replaced is the total number of residues in the interface of the second polypeptide. The preferred import residues for the formation of a cavity are usually naturally occurring amino acid residues and are preferably selected from alanine (A), serine (S), threonine (T), valine (V) and glycine (G). Most preferred amino acid residues are serine, alanine or threonine, most preferably alanine. In the preferred embodiment, the original residue for the formation of the protuberance has a large side chain volume, such as tyrosine (Y), arginine (R), phenylalanine (F) or tryptophan (W). An "original" amino acid residue is one which is replaced by an "import" residue which can have a smaller or larger side chain volume than the original residue. The import amino acid residue can be a naturally occurring or non-naturally occurring amino acid residue, but preferably is the former. By "non-naturally occurring" amino acid residue is meant a residue which is not encoded by the genetic code, but which is able to covalently bind adjacent amino acid residue(s) in the polypeptide chain. Examples of non-naturally occurring amino acid residues are norleucine, ornithine, norvaline, homoserine and other amino acid residue analogues such as those described in Ellman et al, Meth. Enzym. 202:301-336 (1991), for example. To generate such non-naturally occurring amino acid residues, the procedures of Noren et al. Science 244: 182 (1989) and Ellman et al, supra can be used. Briefly, this involves chemically activating a suppressor tRNA with a non-naturally occurring amino acid residue followed by in vitro transcription and translation of the RNA. The methods of the current invention, in certain embodiments, involve replacing at least one original amino acid residue in an IgM heavy chain, but more than one original residue can be replaced. Normally, no more than the total residues in the interface of the first or second polypeptide will comprise original amino acid residues which are replaced. The preferred original residues for replacement are "buried". By "buried" is meant that the residue is essentially inaccessible to solvent. The preferred import residue is not cysteine to prevent possible oxidation or mispairing of disulfide bonds. The protuberance is "positionable" in the cavity which means that the spatial location of the protuberance and cavity on the interface of the first polypeptide and second polypeptide respectively and the sizes of the protuberance and cavity are such that the protuberance can be located in the cavity without significantly perturbing the normal association of the first and second polypeptides at the interface. Since protuberances such as Tyr, Phe and Trp do not typically extend perpendicularly from the axis of the interface and have preferred conformations, the alignment of a protuberance with a corresponding cavity relies on modeling the protuberance/cavity pair based upon a three-dimensional structure such as that obtained by X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). This can be achieved using widely accepted techniques in the art, including techniques of molecular modeling. By "original nucleic acid" is meant the nucleic acid encoding a polypeptide of interest which can be "altered" (i.e. genetically engineered or mutated) to encode a protuberance or cavity. The original or starting nucleic acid may be a naturally occurring nucleic acid or may comprise a nucleic acid which has been subjected to prior alteration (e.g. a humanized antibody fragment). By "altering" the nucleic acid is meant that the original nucleic acid is mutated by inserting, deleting or replacing at least one codon encoding an amino acid residue of interest. Normally, a codon encoding an original residue is replaced by a codon encoding an import residue. Techniques for genetically modifying a DNA in this manner have been reviewed in Mutagenesis: a Practical Approach, M. J. McPherson, Ed., (IRL Press, Oxford, UK. (1991), and include site-directed mutagenesis, cassette mutagenesis and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mutagenesis, for example. The protuberance or cavity can be "introduced" into the interface of the first or second polypeptide by synthetic means, e.g. by recombinant techniques, in vitro peptide synthesis, those techniques for introducing non-naturally occurring amino acid residues previously described, by enzymatic or chemical coupling of peptides or some combination of these techniques. According, the protuberance or cavity which is "introduced" is "non-naturally occurring" or "non-native", which means that it does not exist in nature or in the original polypeptide (e.g. a humanized monoclonal antibody). Preferably the import amino acid residue for forming the protuberance has a relatively small number of "rotamers" (e.g. about 3-6). A "rotamer" is an energetically favorable conformation of an amino acid side chain. The number of rotamers for the various amino acid residues are reviewed in Ponders and Richards, J. Mol. Biol. 193: 775-791 (1987). Unless stated otherwise, the term "antibody" specifically includes native human and non- human IgGl, IgG2, IgG3, IgG4, IgE, IgA, IgD and IgM antibodies, including naturally occurring variants. Thus, for example, the human IgM sequence is available under GenBank Accession Number X14940.1 , while variants have been reported as GenBank CAB37838.1 , CAC20458.1, AFM37312.1, X57331.1, and J00260.1. The term "native" with reference to a polypeptide (e.g. an antibody or a J-chain) is used herein to refer to a polypeptide having a sequence that occurs in nature, regardless of its mode of preparation. Thus, the terms "native" and "native sequence" are used herein interchangeably, and expressly encompass recombinant polypeptides with a sequence that is found in nature. The term "native sequence J-chain" or "native J-chain" as used herein refers to J-chain of native sequence IgM or IgA antibodies of any animal species, including mature human J- chain, the amino acid sequence of which is shown in FIG. 3 (SEQ ID NO: 1) and the J-chains of non-human animal species, including, without limitation, the native sequence J-chain polypeptides of SEQ ID NOs: 2 to 44 shown in FIG. 4 or the bat J-chain polypeptide (SEQ ID NO: 45) shown in FIG. 5. The term "modified J-chain" is used herein to refer to variants of native sequence J- chain polypeptides comprising an extraneous binding moiety introduced into the native sequence. The introduction can be achieved by any means, including direct or indirect fusion of an extraneous binding moiety or by attachment through a chemical linker. The term "modified human J-chain" specifically encompasses, without limitation, a native sequence human J-chain of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 modified by the introduction of a binding moiety. The term specifically encompasses, without limitation, a native sequence human J-chain of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 modified by the introduction of an extraneous binding moiety which does not interfere with efficient polymerization (dimerization) of IgM or IgA and binding of such polymers (dimers) to a target The term "binding moiety" is used herein in the broadest sense to encompass any chemical entity capable of specific binding to a target, such as an antigen. Examples of binding moieties include, without limitation, antibodies, antigen-binding fragments of antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, antibody-like molecules, antigen-binding fragments of antibody-like molecules, soluble and membrane-bound proteins, ligands, receptors, virus-like particles, protein toxins, enzymes, and alternative scaffolds. Preferred binding moieties are polypeptides (including peptides), preferably with a biological function. An exemplary biological function is the ability of a binding moiety to bind to and activate an effector cell, such as a B-cell, a T-cell, or a natural killer (NK)-cell. The term "polypeptide" is used herein in the broadest sense and includes peptide sequences. The term "peptide" generally describes linear molecular chains of amino acids containing up to about 60, preferably up to about 30 amino acids covalently linked by peptide bonds. The term "extraneous" with reference to a "binding moiety" is used herein to refer to a binding moiety not present in a reference native polypeptide sequence at the same location. Thus, an extraneous polypeptide sequence (including peptide sequences), might be comprised within the corresponding native sequence but at a different location. In a preferred embodiment, the "extraneous" sequence is not present in the corresponding native sequence in any location. The term "monoclonal antibody" as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical except for possible naturally occurring mutations that may be present in minor amounts. Monoclonal antibodies are highly specific, being directed against a single antigenic site. Furthermore, in contrast to conventional (polyclonal) antibody preparations which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody is directed against a single determinant on the antigen. The modifier "monoclonal" indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. (1975) Nature 256:495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567). The "monoclonal antibodies" may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clackson et al. (1991) Nature 352:624-628 and Marks et al. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222:581- 597, for example. The monoclonal antibodies herein specifically include "chimeric" antibodies (immunoglobulins) in which a portion of the heavy and/or light chain is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from a particular species, while the remainder of the chain(s) is identical with or homologous to corresponding sequences in antibodies derived from another species, as well as fragments of such antibodies, so long as they exhibit the desired biological activity (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; and Morrison et al. (1984) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81 :6851-6855). "Humanized" forms of non-human {e.g., murine) antibodies are antibodies which contain minimal sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. For the most part, humanized antibodies are human immunoglobulins (recipient antibody) in which residues from a hypervariable region of the recipient are replaced by residues from a hypervariable region of a non-human species (donor antibody) such as mouse, rat, rabbit or nonhuman primate having the desired specificity, affinity, and capacity. In some instances, Fv framework region (FR) residues of the human immunoglobulin are also replaced by corresponding non-human residues. Furthermore, humanized antibodies may comprise residues which are not found in the recipient antibody or in the donor antibody. These modifications are made to further refine antibody performance. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all of at least one, and typically two, variable domains, in which all or substantially all of the hypervariable loops correspond to those of a non-human immunoglobulin and all or substantially all of the FR regions are those of a human immunoglobulin sequence. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. For further details, see Jones et al. (1986) Nature 321 :522-525; Riechmann et al. (1988) Nature 332:323-329; and Presta (1992) Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596. An "isolated" antibody herein is one which has been identified and separated and/or recovered from a component of its natural environment in a recombinant host cell. Contaminant components of its natural environment are materials which would interfere with diagnostic or therapeutic uses for the antibody, and may include enzymes, hormones, and other proteinaceous or nonproteinaceous solutes, as well as undesired byproducts of the production. In a preferred embodiment, an isolated antibody herein will be purified (1) to greater than 95% by weight, or greater than 98%> by weight, or greater than 99%> by weight, as determined by SDS-PAGE or SEC-HPLC methods, (2) to a degree sufficient to obtain at least 15 residues of N-terminal or internal amino acid sequence by use of a amino acid sequencer, or (3) to homogeneity by SDS-PAGE under reducing or non-reducing conditions using Coomassie blue or, preferably, silver stain. Ordinarily, an isolated antibody will be prepare by at least one purification step. The term "specific binding" or "specifically binds to" or is "specific for" refers to the binding of a binding moiety to a binding target, such as the binding of an antibody to a target antigen, e.g., an epitope on a particular polypeptide, peptide, or other target (e.g. a glycoprotein target), and means binding that is measurably different from a non-specific interaction (e.g., a non-specific interaction may be binding to bovine serum albumin or casein). Specific binding can be measured, for example, by determining binding of a binding moiety, or an antibody, or an antibody modified by introduction of a binding moiety, to a target molecule compared to binding to a control molecule. For example, specific binding can be determined by competition with a control molecule that is similar to the target, for example, an excess of non-labeled target. In this case, specific binding is indicated if the binding of the labeled target to a probe is competitively inhibited by excess unlabeled target. The term "specific binding" or "specifically binds to" or is "specific for" a particular polypeptide or an epitope on a particular polypeptide target as used herein can be exhibited, for example, by a molecule having a Kd for the target of at least about 200 nM, alternatively at least about 150 nM, alternatively at least about 100 nM, alternatively at least about 60 nM, alternatively at least about 50 nM, alternatively at least about 40 nM, alternatively at least about 30 nM, alternatively at least about 20 nM, alternatively at least about 10 nM, alternatively at least about 8 nM, alternatively at least about 6 nM, alternatively at least about 4 nM, alternatively at least about 2 nM, alternatively at least about 1 nM, or greater. In certain instances, the term "specific binding" refers to binding where a molecule binds to a particular polypeptide or epitope on a particular polypeptide without substantially binding to any other polypeptide or polypeptide epitope. "Binding affinity" refers to the strength of the sum total of noncovalent interactions between a single binding site of a molecule (e.g., an antibody) and its binding partner (e.g., an antigen). Unless indicated otherwise, as used herein, "binding affinity" refers to intrinsic binding affinity which reflects a 1 : 1 interaction between members of a binding pair (e.g., antibody and antigen). The affinity of a molecule X for its partner Y can generally be represented by the dissociation constant (Kd). For example, the Kd can be about 200 nM, 150 nM, 100 nM, 60 nM, 50 nM, 40 nM, 30 nM, 20 nM, 10 nM, 8 nM, 6 nM, 4 nM, 2 nM, 1 nM, or stronger. Affinity can be measured by common methods known in the art, including those described herein. Low-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen slowly and tend to dissociate readily, whereas high-affinity antibodies generally bind antigen faster and tend to remain bound longer. A variety of methods of measuring binding affinity are known in the art. As used herein, the "Kd" or "Kd value" refers to a dissociation constant measured by a technique appropriate for the antibody and target pair, for example using surface plasmon resonance assays, for example, using a BIAcore™-2000 or a BIAcore™-3000 (BIAcore, Inc., Piscataway, N.J.) at 25°C. with immobilized antigen CM5 chips at about 10 response units (RU). The terms "conjugate," "conjugated," and "conjugation" refer to any and all forms of covalent or non-covalent linkage, and include, without limitation, direct genetic or chemical fusion, coupling through a linker or a cross-linking agent, and non-covalent association. The term "fusion" is used herein to refer to the combination of amino acid sequences of different origin in one polypeptide chain by in-frame combination of their coding nucleotide sequences. The term "fusion" explicitly encompasses internal fusions, i.e., insertion of sequences of different origin within a polypeptide chain, in addition to fusion to one of its termini. The term "fusion" is used herein to refer to the combination of amino acid sequences of different origin The term "valent" as used herein denotes the presence of a specified number of binding sites in an antibody. As such, the terms "bivalent", "tetravalent", and "hexavalent" denote the presence of two binding sites, four binding sites, and six binding sites, respectively. Thus, if in a bispecific IgA antibody according to the present invention each binding unit is bivalent, the bispecific IgA antibody will have 4 valencies. The term "epitope" includes any molecular determinant capable of specific binding to an antibody. In certain embodiments, epitope determinant include chemically active surface groupings of molecules such as amino acids, sugar side chains, phosphoryl, or sulfonyl, and, in certain embodiments, may have specific three dimensional structural characteristics, and or specific charge characteristics. An epitope is a region of an antigen that is bound by an antibody. A "binding region" is a region on a binding target bound by a binding molecule. "Polyepitopic specificity" refers to the ability to specifically bind to two or more different epitopes on the same or different target(s). "Monospecific" refers to the ability to bind only one epitope. According to one embodiment the bispecific IgM antibody binds to each epitope with an affinity of at least 10~7M, or 10~8 M or better. The term "target" or "binding target" is used in the broadest sense and specifically includes polypeptides, without limitation, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, lipids, cells, and other molecules with or without biological function as they exist in nature. The term "antigen" refers to an entity or fragment thereof, which can bind to an antibody or trigger a cellular immune response. An immunogen refers to an antigen, which can elicit an immune response in an organism, particularly an animal, more particularly a mammal including a human. The term antigen includes regions known as antigenic determinants or epitopes, as defined above. As used herein, the term "immunogenic" refers to substances, which elicit the production of antibodies, and/or activate T-cells and/or other reactive immune cells directed against an antigen of the immunogen. An "antigen-binding site" or "antigen-binding region" of an antibody of the present invention typically contains six complementarity determining regions (CDRs) which contribute in varying degrees to the affinity of the binding site for antigen. There are three heavy chain variable domain CDRs (CDRHl, CDRH2 and CDRH3) and three light chain variable domain CDRs (CDRL1, CDRL2 and CDRL3). The extent of CDR and framework regions (FRs) is determined by comparison to a compiled database of amino acid sequences in which those regions have been defined according to variability among the sequences and/or structural information from antibody/antigen complexes. Also included within the scope of the invention are functional antigen binding sites comprised of fewer CDRs (i.e., where binding specificity is determined by three, four or five CDRs). Less than a complete set of 6 CDRs may be sufficient for binding to some binding targets. Thus, in some instances, the CDRs of a VH or a VL domain alone will be sufficient. Furthermore, certain antibodies might have non- CDR-associated binding sites for an antigen. Such binding sites are specifically included within the present definition. The term "host cell" as used in the current application denotes any kind of cellular system which can be engineered to generate the antibodies according to the current invention. In one embodiment Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are used as host cells. As used herein, the expressions "cell," "cell line," and "cell culture" are used interchangeably and all such designations include progeny. Thus, the words "transformants" and "transformed cells" include the primary subject cell and cultures derived therefrom without regard for the number of transfers. It is also understood that all progeny may not be precisely identical in DNA content, due to deliberate or inadvertent mutations. Variant progeny that have the same function or biological activity as screened for in the originally transformed cell are included. A nucleic acid is "operably linked" when it is placed in a functional relationship with another nucleic acid sequence. For example, DNA for a pre-sequence or secretory leader is operably linked to DNA for a polypeptide if it is expressed as a pre-protein that participates in the secretion of the polypeptide; a promoter or enhancer is operably linked to a coding sequence if it affects the transcription of the sequence; or a ribosome binding site is operably linked to a coding sequence if it is positioned so as to facilitate translation. Generally, "operably linked" means that the DNA sequences being linked are contiguous, and, in the case of a secretory leader, contiguous and in reading frame. However, enhancers do not have to be contiguous. Linking is accomplished by ligation at convenient restriction sites. If such sites do not exist, the synthetic oligonucleotide adaptors or linkers are used in accordance with conventional practice. Detailed Description Design and Production of Antibodies with Modified J-Chain IgM is the first immunoglobulin produced by B cells in response to stimulation by antigen, and is present at around 1.5 mg/ml in serum with a half-life of 5 days. IgM is a pentameric or hexameric molecule. Just as IgG, IgM monomers consist of two light and two heavy chains. However, while IgG contains three heavy chain constant domains (CHI, CH2 and CH3), the heavy (μ) chain of IgM additionally contains a fourth constant domain (CH4), similarly to the ε heavy chains in IgE. This extra constant domain is located in place of the IgG and IgA proline-rich hinge region that is responsible for the rotational flexibility of the antigen-binding Fab domains relative to the Fc domain of IgG and IgA antibodies. Five IgM monomers form a complex with an additional small polypeptide chain (the J- chain) to form a native IgM molecule. The J-chain is considered to facilitate polymerization of μ chains before IgM is secreted from antibody-producing cells. While crystallization of IgM has proved to be notoriously challenging, Czajkowsky and Shao (PNAS 106(35): 14960- 14965, 2009) recently published a homo logy-based structural model of IgM, based on the structure of the IgE Fc domain and the known disulfide pairings. The authors report that the human IgM pentamer is a mushroom-shaped molecule with a flexural bias. The IgM heavy (μ) chain contains five N-linked glycosylation sites: Asn-171, Asn-332, Asn-395, Asn-402 and Asn-563. Immunoglobulin A (IgA), as the major class of antibody present in the mucosal secretions of most mammals, represents a key first line of defense against invasion by inhaled and ingested pathogens. IgA is also found at significant concentrations in the serum of many species, where it functions as a second line of defense mediating elimination of pathogens that have breached the mucosal surface. Receptors specific for the Fc region of IgA, FcaR, are key mediators of IgA effector function. Human IgA may have two different IgA heavy constant region (Ca) genes which give rise to the two subclasses, IgAl and IgA2. The main difference between IgAl and IgA2 resides in the hinge region that lies between the two Fab arms and the Fc region. IgAl has an extended hinge region due to the insertion of a duplicated stretch of amino acids, which is absent in IgA2. IgA has the capacity to form dimers, in which two monomer units, each comprising two heavy chains and light chains, are postulated to be arranged in an end-to-end configuration stabilized by disulfide bridges and incorporation of a J-chain. Dimeric IgA, produced locally at mucosal sites, is transported across the epithelial cell boundary and out into the secretions by interaction with the polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (plgR). During this process the plgR is cleaved and the major fragment, termed secretory component (SC), becomes covalently attached to the IgA dimer. Both IgA and IgM possess an 18-amino acid extension in the C terminus called the "tail-piece" (tp). The IgM (μίρ) and IgA (atp) tail-pieces differ at seven amino acid positions. The IgM and IgA tail-piece is highly conserved among various animal species. The conserved penultimate cysteine residue in the IgA and IgM tail-pieces has been demonstrated to be involved in polymerization. Both tail-pieces contain an N-linked carbohydrate addition site, the presence of which is required for dimer formation in IgA and J-chain incorporation and pentamer formation in IgM. However, the structure and composition of the N-linked carbohydrates in the tail-pieces differ, suggesting differences in the accessibility of the glycans to processing by glycosyltransferases. The nucleotide and/or protein sequences of J-chains of human, and various vertebrate animal species, such as cow, mouse, avian, amphibian, and rabbit, have been reported. The human J-chain contains eight cysteine residues, two (Cysl3 and Cys69) are involved in disulfide bridges with the a or //-chains (in IgA and IgM, respectively), and six are involved in intrachain disulfide bridges (Cysl3: CyslOl, Cys72: Cys92, Cysl09: Cysl34). The three- dimensional crystal structure of the J-chain has not been reported. The present invention is based, at least in part, on the recognition that the J-chain of IgM and IgA antibodies can be modified by introduction of a binding specificity (binding moiety), without interfering with the ability of the IgM or IgA antibody to bind to its binding target(s). Accordingly, the present invention concerns modified J-chains comprising a binding moiety introduced into a native sequence J-chain, such as a native sequence human J-chain of SEQ ID NO: 1. The invention further concerns binding molecules comprising a modified J- chain. The binding molecule can, for example, be an IgM antibody, an IgA antibody, or an IgG/IgM or IgG/IgA hybrid antibody, which may contain an IgM or IgA tail-piece at the IgG heavy chain and thus combine the properties of IgG and IgA or IgA, including the ability to incorporate and form polymers with a modified J-chain of the present invention. For further details on IgG/IgM and IgG/IgA hybrid antibodies see, e.g. Koteswara et al, Clinical Immunology 2001, 101(1):21-31. The modified J-chain comprises an extraneous binding moiety, which includes, but is not limited to, a polypeptide (including peptides) capable of specifically binding to a binding target, or catalytic components, such as enzyme-like proteases. As discussed earlier, the binding moieties include, without limitation, antibodies, antigen-binding fragments of antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, antigen-binding fragments of antibody-drug conjugate, antibody-like molecules, antigen-binding fragments of antibody-like molecules, soluble and membrane-bound proteins, ligands, receptors, virus-like particles, protein toxins, catalytic components, such as enzymes and enzyme-like proteases, and alternative scaffolds. It is emphasized that any type of binding moiety can be introduced into a J-chain, following the teaching of the present disclosure, by appropriately selecting the location, type of addition (e.g. direct or indirect fusion, chemical tethering, etc.). In a preferred embodiment, the binding moiety is an antibody or an antigen-binding fragment of an antibody (also referred to as an "antibody fragment"), including monospecific, bispecific, and multi-specific antibodies and antibody fragments. The term "antibody fragment" is used in the broadest sense and includes, without limitation, Fab, Fab', F(ab')2, scFv, and (scFv)2 fragments, complementarity determining region (CDR) fragments, linear antibodies, single-chain antibody molecules, minibodies, and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. In a preferred embodiment, the antibody fragment is a scFv. In another preferred embodiment, the binding moiety is an antibody- like molecule, such as, for example, a human domain antibody (dAb), Dual- Affinity Re-Targeting (DART) molecule, a diabody, a di-diabody, dual-variable domain antibody, a Stacked Variable Domain antibody, a Small Modular ImmunoPharmaceutical (SMIP), a Surrobody, a strand-exchange engineered domain (SEED)-body, or TandAb. The binding moiety may be a ligand, such as a neurotrophin, an interleukin, a soluble molecular factor or a growth factor. Receptors, as binding molecules, include ion-channel-linked, G-protein- linked, and enzyme-linked cell surface receptors. Specific examples, include, without limitation, ErbBl, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, TNFR, PDL1, and CTLA-4. In a further preferred embodiment, the binding moiety is an alternative scaffold. In this context, the term "scaffold" is meant to describe a protein framework that can carry altered amino acids or sequence insertions that confer on protein variants the ability to bind specific targets. Protein alternative scaffolds include, without limitation, CTLA-4. tendamistat, fibronectin, nco carzino statin, lipocalins, T-cell receptor, CBM4-2, protein A domain, lm9, designed AR proteins, designed TPR proteins, zinc finger, pVIII, avian pancreatic polypeptide, GCN4, WW domain, SRC homology domains 2 and 3, PDZ domains, TEM-1, β-lactamase, GFP, thioredoxin, Staphylococcal nuclease, PHD-finger, cl-2, BPTI, APPI, HPSTI, ecotin, LACI-D1, LDTI, MTI-II, scorpion toxins, knottins, insect defensin A peptide, EETI-II, Min-23, CBD, PBP, cytochrome b562, LDLreceptor domain A, γ-crystallin, ubiquitin, transferrin, C-type lectin-like domain. Preferred alternative scaffolds are darpins, fibronectin domains and adnectins. For further details see, Binz HK et al, 2005 Nature Biotechnology 23(10): 1257-1268. The binding moiety may be introduced into the native J-chain sequence at any location that allows the binding of the binding moiety to its binding target without interfering with the binding of the recipient IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM or IgG/IgA molecule to its binding target or binding targets. Preferred locations include at or near the C-terminus, at or near the N- terminus or at an internal location that, based on the three-dimensional structure of the J-chain is accessible. In preferred embodiments, the binding moiety is introduced into the native sequence J-chain without about 10 residues from the C-terminus or without about 10 amino acid residues from the N-terminus, where the native sequence J-chain preferably is human J- chain of SEQ ID NO: 1. In another embodiment, the binding moiety is introduced into the native sequence human J-chain of SEQ ID NO: 1 in between cysteine residues 92 and 101 of SEQ ID NO: 1, or at an equivalent location of another native sequence J-chain. In a further embodiment, the binding moiety is introduced into a native sequence J-chain, such as a J- chain of SEQ ID NO: 1, at or near a glycosylation site. Most preferably, the binding moiety is introduced into the native sequence human J-chain of SEQ ID NO: within about 10 amino acid residues from the C-terminus. Introduction can be accomplished by direct or indirect fusion, i.e. by the combination of the J-chain and binding moiety amino acid sequences in one polypeptide chain by in- frame combination of their coding nucleotide sequences, with or without a peptide linker. The peptide linker (indirect fusion), if used, may, for example, be about 1 to 50, or about 1 to 40, or about 1 to 30, or about 1 to 20, or about 1 to 10, or about 10 to 20 amino acid residues, and may be present at one or both ends of the binding moiety to be introduced into the J-chain sequence. In a preferred embodiment, the peptide linker is about 10 to 20, or 10 to 15 amino acids long. In another preferred embodiment, the peptide linker is 15 amino acids long. The binding moiety may also be appended to the native J-chain sequence by chemical linkage using heterobifunctional protein crosslinkers contain two different functional groups, which have their own reactivity and selectivity. These crosslinkers can be used in a one step process or can be used to create activated proteins, which can often be preserved and reacted with the second biomolecule in a separate step. Thus, for example, a heterobifunctional crosslinking reagent can be used to form conjugates between a J-chain and a binding moiety. The reactive groups include, without limitation imine reactive groups (such as NHS or Sulfo- NHS), maleimide groups, and the like. Such crosslinkers, which can be cleavable or non- cleavable, have been used, for example, in the formation of hapten carrier proteins and in preparing enzyme-antibody conjugates. Chemically, the cleavable crosslinkers specifically include, without limitation, disulfide-based, hydrazone, and peptide linkers. A well known and much studied enzyme-labile linker is a valine- citrulline linker but other peptide linkers are also known and suitable. Typical representatives of non-cleavable linkers include thioethers, such as SMCC (N-5uccinimidyl-4-(N-maleimidomethyl)-cyclohexane-l-carboxylate). For further details see, e.g. Ducry L and Stump B, Bioconjugate Chem. 2010, 21 :5-13, the entire disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein. For listing of further suitable linkers see, e.g. Klein et al, Protein Engineering, Design & Selection; 2014, 27(10): 325-330, the entire disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein. While the modified J-chain usually contains one extraneous binding moiety, it is also possible to introduce more than one binding moiety into a J-chain. The modified J-chain may be produced by well known techniques of recombinant DNA technology, by expressing nucleic acid encoding the modified J-chain in a suitable prokaryotic or eukaryotic host organism, such as CHO cells or E. coli. Thus, the modified J- chain may, for example, be expressed in E. coli, as described by Symersky et al, Mol Immunol 2000, 37: 133-140. In one embodiment, the J-chain can be initially modified by insertion of an enzyme recognition site, and post-translationally modified by a peptide or non-peptide linker, which can tether any extraneous binding moiety to the J-chain, such as, for example, cytotoxic small molecule to make an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC). The modified J-chain can also be co-expressed with the heavy and light chains of the recipient IgM, IgA, IgG/lgM or IgG/lgA antibody. Although due to its complex structure, the large scale production of recombinant IgM has been difficult, several recombinant production systems for IgM using non-lymphoid cells have been reported, including co-expression of the IgM heavy (H) and light (L) chains in C6 glioma cells, CHO cells, and HeLa cells (see, e.g.W089/01975 and Wood et al, J. Immunol. 145, 301 1-3016 (1990) for expression in CHO cells). Expression of an IgM monoclonal antibody in E. coli, with or without a J-chain, is described, e.g. in Azuma et al, Clin Cancer Res 2007, 13(9):2745-2750. Production of IgM in an immortalized human retina cell line expressing EIA and EIB proteins of an adenovirus is described in U. S. Application Publication No. 20060063234. The recipient antibody may be monospecific, bispecific or multi-specific. Bispecific and multi-specific IgM and IgA binding molecules, including antibodies, are described, for example, in U.S. Application Serial Nos. 61/874,277 and 61/937,984, the entire contents of which are hereby expressly incorporated by reference. Applications of Antibodies with Modified J-Chain Antibodies comprising a modified J-chain of the present invention have widespread therapeutic and diagnostic applications. In one embodiment, antibodies comprising a modified J-chain bind to two or more sites on the same soluble target, such as, for example, VEGF, TNFa, or IL6. The purpose may, for example, be antagonizing multiple sites on the protein and/or increasing the avidity to a given target. In another embodiment, the antibodies comprising a modified J-chain herein bind two or more sites on the same cell surface (receptor) target, such as EGFR or HER2 (ErbB2). Thus, for example, such antibodies might target both the 4D5 and the 2C4 epitopes on a HER2 molecule. This approach may increase bio -potency and/or avidity to a given target. In yet another embodiment, the antibodies comprising the modified J-chains of the present invention bind two or more different soluble targets (globular proteins or peptides), e.g. TNFa and IL6, VEGFa and Ang2, or two cytokines. This approach might result, for example, in more complete blocking a specific pathway; blocking of the so called "cytokine storm," i.e. undesirable T cell activation resulting from certain multivalent bispecific antibodies, such as bispecific antibodies for the CD3 antigen, or coordinate an enzyme and its substrate, e.g. Factor IXa and Factor X. Specific examples include, without limitation, bispecific antibodies with modified J-chain, where a first specificity is directed to VEGF and a second specificity is directed to Ang2 or DLL4 (anti-angiogenesis), or a first specificity is directed to TNF and a second specificity is directed to Ang2 or IL-17 (anti- inflammatory properties), where either specificity may be introduced into the J-chain of an IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM or IgG/IgA antibody, or an antigen-binding fragment thereof. In a further embodiment, antibodies comprising a modified J-chain may bind one or more soluble targets and one or more cell surface receptor targets, such as an angiogenic factor and neo-vascular specific receptor. The purpose of this approach may also be increased delivery and blockade at specific sites or tissues. In a still further embodiment, antibodies comprising a modified J-chain are designed to bind two or more different cell surface receptor targets, such as, for example, HER1, HER2 (ErbB2) and HER3 (ErbB3), inhibiting multiple targets through the same or different pathways. This may result in enhancing specificity and selectivity and/or in more complete blocking of a given pathway. Specific examples of such antibodies include, without limitation, bispecific antibodies with a modified J-chain where one specificity is directed to HER2 and another specificity is directed to HER3; or one specificity is directed to EGFR (HER1) and another specificity is directed to HER2. Other bispecific IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM or IgG/IgA antibodies with a modified J-chain may, for example, bind to EGFR and HER3, IL-l and IL- 1β, IL-4 and IL-13, Ang-2 and VEGF-A, Factor IXA and Factor X, or IL-17A and IL-17F. Antibodies comprising a modified J-chain of the present invention may also be designed to bind one or more soluble targets or cell surface receptor targets and one or more long residence time targets, such as, for example, TNFa and/or VEGF and serum albumin. These molecules are expected to have longer circulating half-life than binding molecules without the albumin specificity. In a further embodiment, antibodies comprising a modified J-chain herein may bind one or more soluble targets and one or more matrix proteins and/or substrates, such as, for example, VEGFa and hyaluronic acid. The resultant multi-specific binding molecules may find utility, for example, in anti-angiogenic therapy of ocular conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), due to their increased residence time in the intraocular space. Antibodies comprising a modified J-chain and binding one or more soluble or receptor target, plus one or more transporter receptor (ie transferrin receptor), e.g. anti-EGFRvIII (mutant form with exon III deleted) found glioblastoma combined with anti-transferrin specificity, can find utility in antibody delivery across blood brain barrier. In a preferred embodiment, the IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM and IgG/IgA antibodies herein comprise a modified J-chain with binding specificity for an immune cell, such as a T-cell, NK-cell, a macrophage, or a neutrophil, and bind to an antigen expressed on a disease cell or pathogen. Since an IgM molecule comprises 5 binding units, and an IgA molecule is a dimer comprising two binding units, such molecules are significantly more potent due to their greater avidity than bispecific IgG antibodies. In addition, by activating and redirecting effector cells, e.g. effector T cells, to targeted disease cells, tissues or pathogens the IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM and IgG/IgA antibodies herein induce an immune response against the target, thereby further increasing potency and efficacy. Due to these beneficial properties, the IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM and IgG/IgA antibodies herein, comprising a modified J-chain, are especially advantageous in situations where IgG antibodies bind to their target with low affinity. Thus, in one embodiment, the IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM and IgG/IgA antibodies herein may comprise the binding domain of a therapeutic IgG antibody. In certain embodiments, the IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM and IgG/IgA antibodies herein comprising a modified J-chain may be used for the treatment of cancer. It is anticipated that any type of tumor and any type of tumor-associated antigen may be targeted. Exemplary types of cancers include, without limitation, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, biliary cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, esophageal, gastric, head and neck cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, lung cancer, medullary thyroid cancer, non- Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, renal cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioma, melanoma, liver cancer, prostate cancer, and urinary bladder cancer. However, the skilled artisan will realize that tumor-associated antigens are known in the art for virtually any type of cancer. Tumor-associated antigens that may be targeted by the IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM, or IgG/IgA antibodies of the presence invention include, without limitation, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), associated antigens, Ba 733, BAGE, BrE3-antigen, CA125, CAMEL, CAP-1, carbonic anhydrase IX, CASP-8/m, CCCL19, CCCL21, CD1, CDla, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD11A, CD14, CD15, CD16, CD18, CD19, CD20, CD21, CD22, CD23, CD25, CD29, CD30, CD32b, CD33, CD37, CD38, CD40, CD40L, CD44, CD45, CD46, CD52, CD54, CD55, CD59, CD64, CD66a-e, CD67, CD70, CD70L, CD74, CD79a, CD80, CD83, CD95, CD126, CD132, CD133, CD138, CD147, CD154, CDC27, CDK-4/m, CDKN2A, CTLA-4, CXCR4, CXCR7, CXCL12, HIF-la, colon-specific antigen-p (CSAp), CEA (CEACAM5), CEACAM6, c-Met, DAM, EGFR (HERl, ErbBl), ErbB2 (HER2), ErbB4 (HER3), EGFRvlll, EGP-1 (TROP-2), EGP-2, ELF2-M, Ep-CAM, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), Flt-1, Flt-3, folate receptor, G250 antigen, GAGE, gplOO, GRO-.beta., HLA-DR, HM1.24, human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and its subunits, HER2/neu, HMGB-1, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1), HSP70-2M, HST-2, la, IGF-1R, IFN-γ IFN-a, IFN-β, IFN-λ, IL-4R, IL-6R, IL-13R, IL-15R, IL-17R, IL-18R, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-15, IL-17, IL-18, IL-23, IL-25, insulin- like growth factor- 1 (IGF-1), KC4-antigen, KS-1 -antigen, KS1-4, Le-Y, LDR/FUT, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), MAGE, MAGE-3 , MART- 1 , MART-2, NY- ESO-1, TRAG-3, mCRP, MCP-1, MIP-1A, MIP-1B, MIF, MUC1, MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, MUC5ac, MUC13, MUC16, MUM- 1/2, MUM-3, NCA66, NCA95, NCA90, PAM4 antigen, pancreatic cancer mucin, PD-1 receptor, placental growth factor, p53, PLAGL2, prostatic acid phosphatase, PSA, PRAME, PSMA, P1GF, ILGF, ILGF-1R, IL-6, IL-25, RS5, RANTES, T 101 , SAGE, S 100, survivin, survivin-2B, TAC, TAG-72, tenascin, TRAIL receptors, TNF- . alpha., Tn antigen, Thomson-Friedenreich antigens, tumor necrosis antigens, VEGFR, ED-B fibronectin, WT-1, 17-lA-antigen, complement factors C3, C3a, C3b, C5a, C5, an angiogenesis marker, bcl-2, bcl-6, Kras. As discussed above, for oncological applications, antibodies comprising a modified J- chain can be designed to trigger the killing function of immune cells against targeted cancer cells. Thus, for example, the J-chain of IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM or IgG/IgA antibodies, or antigen- binding fragments thereof, can be modified by introducing into a native J-chain a binding specificity for an immune cell, such as a T-cell or a Natural Killer (NK) cell, while the IgA, IgG/IgM or IgG/IgA antibody provides binding specificity to a target cell, e.g. a tumor marker, such as an oncogene, on the surface of a tumor cell, including, for example, any or more of the tumor-associated antigens listed above. In the case of T-cells, cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) is a multimeric protein complex, known historically as the T3 complex, and is composed of four distinct polypeptide chains (ε, γ, δ, ζ) that assemble and function as three pairs of dimers (εγ, εδ, ζζ). The CD3 complex serves as a T cell co-receptor that associates non-covalently with the T cell receptor (TCR). Components of this CD3 complex, especially CD3s, are targets for a modified J-chain of an IgM antibody specifically binding to a tumor-associated antigen. Although the modified J-chain specific for effector T cells preferably binds to the CD3 (CD3s) antigen, other antigens expressed on effector T cells are known and may be targeted by the modified J-chain. Exemplary T-cell antigens include, but are not limited to, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD6, CD8, CD25, CD28, CD30, CD40, CD40L, CD44, CD45, CD69 and CD90. Exemplary IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM, or IgG/IgA antibodies including a modified J-chain with CD3 binding specificity, may include the binding regions of known IgG antibodies to tumor-associated antigens, such as, for example, blinatumomab (also known as MT103) (anti- CD19), CD19hA19 (anti-CD19, U.S. Pat. No. 7,109,304), hPAM4 (anti-mucin, U.S. Pat. No. 7,282,567), hA20 (anti-CD20, U.S. Pat. No. 7,251,164), hIMMU31 (anti- AFP, U.S. Pat. No. 7,300,655), hLLl (anti-CD74, U.S. Pat. No. 7,312,318), hLL2 (anti-CD22, U.S. Pat. No. 7,074,403), hMu-9 (anti-CSAp, U.S. Pat. No. 7,387,773), hL243 (anti-HLA-DR, U.S. Pat. No. 7,612,180), hMN-14 (anti-CEACAM5, U.S. Pat. No. 6,676,924), hMN-15 (anti-CEACAM6, U.S. Pat. No. 7,541,440), hRS7 (anti-EGP-1, U.S. Pat. No. 7,238,785), hMN-3 (anti- CEACAM6, U.S. Pat. No. 7,541,440), AM 24 and AM 25 (anti-CXCR4, U.S. Pat. No. 7,138,496), the disclosures of which are expressly incorporated by reference herein. In a specific embodiment, an IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM, or IgG/IgA antibody comprising the CD 19 binding region of blinatumomab comprises a modified J-chain comprising the CD3 binding region of blinatumomab. This antibody can be used, e.g. for the treatment of non- Hodgkin lymphoma, or acute lymphoblast leukemia of the B cell series (B-ALL). In another specific embodiment, an IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM, or IgG/IgA antibody comprising the CD20 binding region of rituximab comprises a modified J-chain with CD3 specificity, such as a modified J-chain comprising the CD3 binding region of blinatumomab. In yet another specific embodiment, an IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM, or IgG/IgA antibody comprising the EpCAM binding region of MT110 comprises a modified J-chain with CD3 specificity, such as a modified J-chain comprising the CD3 binding region of MT110. Such bispecific antibodies can be used for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancer. Alternative antibodies that can provide binding regions for use in combination with a modified J-chain with CD3 binding specificity include, for example, abciximab (anti- glycoprotein Ilb/IIIa), alemtuzumab (anti-CD52), bevacizumab (anti-VEGF), cetuximab (anti- EGFR), gemtuzumab (anti-CD33), ibritumomab (anti-CD20), panitumumab (anti-EGFR), tositumomab (anti-CD20), trastuzumab (anti-ErbB2), lambrolizumab (anti-PD-1 receptor), nivolumab (anti-PD-1 receptor), ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4), abagovomab (anti-CA-125), adecatumumab (anti-EpCAM), atlizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor), benralizumab (anti-CD 125), obinutuzumab (GA101, anti-CD20), CC49 (anti-TAG-72), AB-PG1-XG 1-026 (anti-PSMA, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/983,372, deposited as ATCC PTA-4405 and PTA-4406), D2/B (anti-PSMA, WO 2009/130575), tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor), basiliximab (anti- CD25), daclizumab (anti-CD25), efalizumab (anti-CD 1 la), GA101 (anti-CD20; Glycart Roche), atalizumab (anti-.alpha.4 integrin), omalizumab (anti-IgE); anti-TNF-.alpha. antibodies such as CDP571 (Ofei et al, 2011, Diabetes 45:881-85), MTNFAI, M2TNFAI, M3TNFAI, M3TNFABI, M302B, M303 (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, III), infliximab (Centocor, Malvern, Pa.), certolizumab pegol (UCB, Brussels, Belgium), anti-CD40L (UCB, Brussels, Belgium), adalimumab (Abbott, Abbott Park, III), BENLYSTA.RTM. (Human Genome Sciences); antibodies for therapy of Alzheimer's disease such as Alz 50 (Ksiezak- Reding et al, 1987, J Biol Chem 263:7943-47), gantenerumab, solanezumab and infliximab; anti-fibrin antibodies like 59D8, T2Gls, MH1; anti-CD38 antibodies such as MOR03087 (MorphoSys AG), MOR202 (Celgene), HuMax-CD38 (Genmab) or daratumumab (Johnson & Johnson); anti-HIV antibodies such as P4/D10 (U.S. Pat. No. 8,333,971), Ab 75, Ab 76, Ab 77 (Paulik et al, 1999, Biochem Pharmacol 58: 1781-90), as well as the anti-HIV antibodies described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,831,034, U.S. Pat. No. 5,911,989, and Vcelar et al, AIDS 2007; 21(16):2161-2170 and Joos et al, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2006; 50(5): 1773-9. FIG. 19 lists exemplary target antigens for the treatment of hematologic cancer, epithelial tumor, and glycosyl-rich tumors, and exemplary antigens on T-cells, NK-cells, macrophages and neutrophils for targeting with a modified J-chain. It is to be understood that an IgM molecule binding to any of the listed tumor antigens can be combined with a modified J-chain with any of the listed binding specificities. Thus, any antibody target listed in the left column of the table can be combined with any modified J-chain target listed in the right column. In a preferred embodiment, an IgM pentamer provides binding specificity to target cells, such as B-cells, while a binding domain to an effector cell, e.g. a T cell can be covalently attached to the J-chain of the IgM antibody. Thus, the J-chain can be modified by covalent attachment of a CD3 (CD3s) binding domain. In this configuration, the IgM pentamer (comprising 10 copies of heavy chain and 10 copies of light chain) provides binding specificity to the target B-cells, while the T-cell tethering of the J-chain delivers cytotoxic potency. In other words, the IgM antibody binding to a tumor target additionally acquires a T- cell binding function. The CD3 binding domain covalently attached to a native J-chain, or a variant of a native J-chain, can, for example be a single-chain Fv (scFv) of an anti-CD3 antibody, or a naturally occurring heavy chain only antibody, e.g. a camelid (camels, llamas, alpacas) or single-chain antibody of cartilaginous fish (sharks, rays), a scaffold, e.g. fibronectin (e.g. fibronectin III) with CD3 binding specificity. While certain preferred embodiments are specifically referred to herein, it is to be understood that IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM and IgG/IgA antibodies with binding specificity to any target, such as any tumor antigen, comprising a modified J-chain binding to any T-cell marker are contemplated and are within the scope of the present invention. In one embodiment, a multi-specific IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM or IgG/IgA antibody binds to one or more of the tumor targets listed above, while the J-chain is modified to bind to CD3s. In a preferred embodiment, the multi-specific IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM or IgG/IgA antibody binds to one or more of the tumor targets listed in FIG. 19, while the J-chain is modified to bind to CD38. Natural killer (NK) cells are important components of the innate immunity and play a key role in host defense by virtue of their ability to release cytokines and to mediate cytolytic activity against tumor cells and virus-infected cells. NK cell antigens include, without limitation, CD 16, CD32a, CD56, CD57, CD64, CD117 (or c-kit), adhesion molecules including lymphocyte-associated molecule-2 (LFA-2 or CD2), LFA-3 (CD58), and LFA-1 (CD 11 a/CD 18). Examples of NK cell engaging bispecific antibodies with modified J-chain include IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM and IgG/IgA antibodies with binding specificity to any of the tumor antigens listed above comprising a modified J-chain binding to an NK cell. In a particular embodiment, a bispecific IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM and IgG/IgA antibody with HER2 binding specificity comprises a J-chain modified to bind CD 16, CD32a, CD56, or CD64. In another preferred embodiment, a multi-specific IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM or IgG/IgA antibody binds to any of the tumor targets listed in the left column of the table in Figure 19, and the J-chain is modified to bind CD 16, CD64 or NKG2D on NK cells. Macrophage engagement in the J-chain modified antibodies of the present invention can be provided, for example, by introducing a CD 14 specificity into the J-chain. In one embodiment, a multi-specific IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM or IgG/IgA antibody binds to one or more of the tumor targets listed above, while the J-chain is modified to bind to CD14. In a preferred embodiment, the multi-specific IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM or IgG/IgA antibody binds to one or more of the tumor targets listed in FIG. 19, while the J-chain is modified to bind to CD14. The IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM and IgG/IgA antibodies with modified J-chain can target carbohydrate-based antigens, see, e.g. a review article by Cazet et al, Breast Cancer Research; 2010, 12:204. Carbohydrate-based tumor antigens have been shown to have good tumor association, with alternative forma of glycosylation that allow the production of IgG antibodies binding to such antigens with reasonable specificity but not necessarily high affinity. Using IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM, or IgG/IgA antibodies with associated increased avidity against this class of antigens represents great opportunities for new therapeutic antibodies, especially coupled with effector cell mobilization achieved by J-chain modification. In one preferred embodiment, the IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM and IgG/IgA antibody binds to one or more carbohydrate based tumor antigen, while the J-chain is modified to bind any of the effector cells listed in FIG. 19. In another preferred embodiment, the IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM and IgG/IgA antibodies with modified J-chain can be used as part of IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM or IgG/IgA antibodies directed against pathogens. In a preferred embodiment, the pathogens are selected from the group consisting of HIV virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptococcus agalactiae, methicillin- resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella pneumophilia, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, Pneumococcus, Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, Hemophilis influenzae B, Treponema pallidum, Lyme disease spirochetes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium leprae, Brucella abortus, rabies virus, influenza virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus I, herpes simplex virus II, human serum parvo-like virus, respiratory syncytial virus, varicella-zoster virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, measles virus, adenovirus, human T-cell leukemia viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, murine leukemia virus, mumps virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, sindbis virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, wart virus, blue tongue virus, Sendai virus, feline leukemia virus, reovirus, polio virus, simian virus 40, mouse mammary tumor virus, dengue virus, rubella virus, West Nile virus, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Toxoplasma gondii, Trypanosoma rangeli, Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma rhodesiensei, Trypanosoma brucei, Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma japonicum, Babesia bovis, Elmeria tenella, Onchocerca volvulus, Leishmania tropica, Trichinella spiralis, Theileria parva, Taenia hydatigena, Taenia ovis, Taenia saginata, Echinococcus granulosus, Mesocestoides corti, Mycoplasma arthritidis, M. hyorhinis, M. orale, M. arginini, Acholeplasma laidlawii, M. salivarium and M. pneumoniae, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,440,416. In this embodiment, the immune effector cell may, for example, be a neutrophil. Figure 19 specifically lists viral antigens as targets for the IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM and IgG/IgA antibodies herein, in combination with neutrophil markers which can be targeted by the modified J-chain of such antibodies. It is noted that the IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM and IgG/IgA antibodies herein may also target carbohydrate antigens on carbohydrate rich cancers. Such antigens include CEA, CA-125, TADG78, Sialyl Lewis-X (CD 15), for example. In all embodiments, the binding moiety (binding unit) used to modify a native J-chain may be introduced before or after the J-chain. Thus, a modified J-chain with CD3 binding specificity may have an anti-CD3SCFV-J or a J-anti-CD3SCFV configuration. The sequence (SEQ ID NO: 46) and structure of an anti-CD3 single chain Fv comprising the J-chain at the C- terminus (anti-CD3SCFV-J) is shown in Figure 8. The sequence (SEQ ID NO: 47) and structure of an anti-CD3 single chain Fv comprising the J-chain at the N-terminus (J-anti-CD3SCFV) is shown in Figure 9. Due to their increased avidity such antibodies are superior relative to bispecific IgG antibodies. For example, as a result, they are suitable for targeting low copy- number targets, such as Rituxan resistant Burkitt lymphoma cells characterized by low level of CD20 expression. In addition, the IgM, IgA, IgG/IgM and IgG/IgA antibodies herein comprising a modified J-chain have greatly enhanced potency relative to bispecific IgG antibodies. Pharmaceutical Compositions of Antibodies with Modified J-Chain For therapeutic uses, antibodies comprising a modified J-chain may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions. A pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be administered by a variety of methods known in the art. As will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, the route and/or mode of administration will vary depending upon the target disease or condition and the desired results. To administer a compound of the invention by certain routes of administration, it may be necessary to coat the compound with, or co-administer the compound with, a material to prevent its inactivation. For example, the compound may be administered to a subject in an appropriate carrier, for example, liposomes, or a diluent. Pharmaceutically acceptable diluents include saline and aqueous buffer solutions. Pharmaceutical carriers include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is known in the art. The compositions may also contain adjuvants such as preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifying agents and/or dispersing agents. Prevention of presence of microorganisms may be ensured both by sterilization procedures and by the inclusion of various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, paraben, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, such as sugars, sodium chloride, and the like into the compositions. In addition, prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form may be brought about by the inclusion of agents which delay absorption such as aluminum monostearate and gelatin.

Generation of DNA constructs with designed mutations a. DNA construct synthesis. All the DNA constructs with designed mutations are synthesized by the commercial vendors (Genescript), with compatible restriction sites at both ends for subcloning into respective expression vectors. b. Constructing expression vectors. The synthesized DNA constructs are re- suspended in Tris-EDTA buffer at 1 μg/ml. DNA (1 μg) is subjected to enzyme digestion and the synthesized gene is separated from the carrier plasmid DNA by electrophoresisThe digested DNA is ligated to pre-digested plasmid DNA (pCAGGS for J-chain, Gene 108 (1991) 193-200) by standard molecular biology techniques. The ligated DNA is transformed into competent bacteria and plated on LB plates with multiple selective antibiotics. Several bacterial colonies are picked and DNA preparations are made by standard molecular biology techniques. The prepared DNA are verified by sequencing. Only the bacterial clones with 100% match of DNA sequence with the designed DNA sequence are used for plasmid DNA preparation and subsequently for cell transfection. c. Different J-chains.

Capture Select IgM (BAC, Thermo Fisher). IgM proteins from transfected CHO cell supernatants are partially purified by immuno-precipitation with Capture Select IgM affinity matrix according to manufacturers' protocol (GE Life Sciences). After incubation at room temperature for 2 hours, the affinity matrix is separated from the supernatant by centrifugation. The matrix is further washed with PBS for 3 times before the PBS is carefully removed. The captured protein is eluted from the matrix by incubating with NuPage LDS protein buffer (Life Technology) for 5 minutes. ii. Anti-myc agarose affinity matrix (Sigma). IgM proteins from transfected CHO cell supernatants are partially purified by immunoprecipitation with anti-myc affinity matrix according to manufacturers' protocol. After incubation at room temperature for 2 hours, the affinity matrix is separated from the supernatant by centrifugation. The matrix is further washed with PBS for 3 times before the PBS is carefully removed after the final wash. The captured protein is eluted from the matrix by incubating with NuPage LDS protein buffer (Life Technology) for 5 minutes. Gel electrophoresis i. Non-reducing SDS PAGE ii. . Non-reducing SDS PAGE separates native IgM and its mutant forms according to size. Pentameric IgM, composed of homodimeric heavy and light chains, produces a protein band of approximately 1,000,000 molecular weight. NuPage LDS Sample Buffer (Life Technologies) is added to IgM protein samples at 25 C for 30 minutes before loading onto the gel. NativePage Novex 3-12% Bis-Tris Gel (Life Technologies) is used with Novex Tris- Acetate SDS Running Buffer (Life Technologies). Run gel until the dye front reaches the bottom of the gel. iii. Reducing SDS-PAGE. NuPage LDS sample buffer ( Life Technologies) and NuPage reducing agent dithiothreitol (Life Technologies) are added to IgM protein samples and heated to 80°C for 10 minutes before loading on NuPage Novex 4- 12% Bis-Tris Gel (Life Technologies). NuPage MES SDS Running Buffer (Life Technologies) is used for gel electrophoresis. Gels are run until the dye front reaches the bottom of the gel. After electrophoresis is complete, remove gel from apparatus and stain the gel using Colloidal Blue Staining (Life Technologies). iv. Western Blot Detection. After electrophoresis is complete, remove gel from XCell SureLock Mini-Cell. Transfer to PVDF membrane at 30 volts for 1 hour (refer to Life Technologies' manual). Block with 20 ml 3% BSA in PBST at 25 C for 1 hour. For anti-J-chain Western blot, add anti-J (SP105, Thermo Fisher) at 1 :500 in 3% BSA in PBST overnight at 4C. Wash with PBST four times at room temperature. Add HRP-Goat anti rabbit IgG ( Jackson Immunology) at 1 :5,000 in 3% BSA in PBST for 1 hour at room temperature. Wash with PBST 4 times at room temperature. Add 10 ml of HRP chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher) for 10 minutes before exposing the blot to film. Anti-J-chain antibody only reacts with IgM which is co-expressed with either unmodified J-chain (Figure 6) or modified J-chain (Figure 7). For anti-myc western blot, add anti-myc (4A6, Millipore) at 1 :200 in 3%BSA in PBST for overnight at 4C. Wash with PBST four times at room temperature. Add HRP-Goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunology) at 1 :5,000 in 3% BSA in PBST for 1 hour at room temperature. Wash with PBST 4 times at room temperature. Add 10 ml of HRP chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher) for 10 minutes before exposing the blot to film. Anti-myc antibody only reacts with modified J- chain with myc tag (Figure 2). ecific functional analysis a. FACS analysis of target binding IGM-55.5 with CD3scFv-J or IGM-55.5 with J-CD3scFv binding to T cells is confirmed by binding of antibody to T cell line (Jurkat, CD3 positive cell line) and B cell line (Nalm6, negative control cell line). After washing, rhodamine labeled 4A6 is added to the cell suspension. The cell target binding is detected by MFI of both positive and negative control cells with or without CD3 antigen. IGM-55.5 with CD3scFv-J or IGM-55.5 with J-CD3scFv binding to CDIM expressing cells is confirmed by binding of antibody to positive cell line (Daudi, positive cell line) and negative cell line (Peer). After washing, rhodamine labeled 4A6 is added to the cell suspension. The cell target binding is detected by MFI of both positive and negative control cells with or without CDIM antigen. b. FACS analysis of T-cell mediated B-cell killing in co-culture Raji, a CD19+CD20+ B cell line, was co-cultured with T-ALL, a CD8+ Cytolytic T cell line with CD20 IgM x J- wild-type or CD20 IgM x CD3-J chain for 24 hours at 37 degrees, 5% C02. Cell were harvested and stained with fluorescent antibodies to CD3 (552852/BD Biosciences) and CD 19 (555413/BD Biosciences) and analyzed by flow cytometry to assess viable B cells. c. Complement dependent cytotoxicity of B-cells Ramos, a CD20+ cell line was seeded in 96 well half area white plates at 25,000 cells/well. Antibody and human complement (5% final, Quidel) were added to initiate complement dependent cytotoxicity and the number of viable cells were measured using Cell Titer Glo and manufacturer's protocol. Luminescence was measured on an Envision multimode reader (Perkin Elmer) using 0.1 s integration time per well. Percent viable cells was calculated by normalizing the luminescence values (Relative luminescence units - RLU) versus wells with no added drug. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism and a four parameter fit with top and bottom values fixed at 100 and 0% viability respectively. Multi-specific binding and multi-specific functional analysis can be performed in a similar maimer using techniques known in the art, such as those described above. Example 2: Molecular cloning, expression and purification of a bispecific anti-CD20 IgM antibody with a modified J-chain carrying an anti-CD3 binding scFv This example describes the preparation of the molecular cloning, expression and purification of a further IgM antibody targeting a different B-cell antigen (CD20) and a modified J-chain binding to CD3. The DNA corresponding to the heavy and light chain sequences below was prepared using the methods as described in Example 1.

As shown in Figure 13, all four proteins express well. The anti- CD20 IgM hexamer without J-chain is clearly resolved from the J-chain containing pentamers for the IgM pentamer with the wild type J-chain as well as for the bispecific IgM's where the anti-CD3 scFv is linked to the J-chain in either orientation (015 J or J150). Example 3: Molecular cloning, expression and purification of bispecific anti-CD20 IgM antibody comprising a modified J-chain carrying a different anti-CD3 binding scFv To establish that assembly of bispecific IgM is feasible with a modified J-chain carrying an anti-CD3 scFv of a different sequence than that used Examples 1 and 2, a J-chain carrying the variable regions from the antibody Visilizumab (Nuvion) was performed. Shown below are the sequences for two J-chains with the scFv corresponding to Visilizumab (V) fused to the J-chain through a linker containing 15 aa's in two different orientations - V15J and J15V.

As shown in Figure 13, J-chains fused to the new anti-CD3 scFv with the 15 aa linker are able to incorporate into the IgM and the pentameric form of bi- specific IgM with the corresponding J-chain is clearly distinguishable from the hexameric form without a J-chain. Example 4: Molecular cloning, expression and purification of an IgM comprising an anti-CD 16 camelid modified J-chain versions of a second effector cell binding domain - anti-CD 16 camelid This example demonstrates that it is possible to link a binding moiety different from an scFv to a J-chain, which is directed to a different target on a different effector cell population. A camelid Vhh sequence shown below was used, that was selected for binding to the CD 16 antigen on natural killer cells (NK cells). Once again, this sequence was linked to a J-chain using a flexible 15 aa linker to produce C15J. The bispecific IgM was expressed and purified as described in Example 1 and analyzed on hybrid gels. Formation of a pentameric species is clearly seen. Further, incorporation of the CI 5 J J-chain into the pentameric IgM was established using western blot (Figure 18).

IgM antibodies are known to have enhanced complement dependent cell killing (CDC) due to their multimeric form. A key aspect of this invention was to test if incorporation of modified J-chains, which carry scFv or camelid Vhh binders of effector cells at either their C- or N~ termini, causes interference with binding of Clq - the key component of the complement pathway, and therefore may inhibit CDC. We measured the CDC activity of each of the IgM and bispecific IgM constructs. As shown in Figure 14, we find that incorporation of the modified J-chain has, unexpectedly, no deleterious effect on the CDC activity of our bispecific IgM's, Moreover, with the linker lengths we tested, we find that the bispecific IgM's have CDC activity between 60-100 fold enhanced over the corresponding IgG on a molar basis (Figure 14). Example 6: Analysis of T-cell dependent B-cell killing by bispecific IgM in in vitro co-culture Engagement of effector T-cells by bispecific IgM antibodies with a modified J-chain is expected to greatly enhance killing of the target B-cell populations compared to the IgM carrying no J-chain or the wild type J-chain. To test cell killing in co-culture, we performed a cell killing assay as described in Example 1. Antibody at a single high concentration (100 ng/mL) incubated with CD20+ Raji ceils and CD3+ effector T-ALL cells. As shown in Figure 15, the bispecific IgM carrying a CDS binding scFv on its J-chain is able to cause complete killing of B-cells. The same experiment done as a dose response shows that there is a greater than 300 fold improvement in B-cell killing compared to the IgM that carries no scFv capable of engaging T-cells. Complete killing of B-cells by bispecific IgM is observed at concentrations as low as 10 ng/mL. Example 7s Demonstration of T-cell dependent B-cell killing in vivo in NSG mouse model In order to test the bispecific IgM's we made in an in vivo context, we performed experiments with humanized non-obese diabetic severe combined immune-deficient gamma null (NSG) mice. These mice have severely impaired immune function and lack mouse T- and B- lymphocytes. They are reconstituted with human CD34+ stem cells to create mice with essentially human lymphocyte populations. When CD20 IgM x CD3-J chain was dosed intravenously in these animals at 0.5mg kg and whole blood was obtained and analyzed by flow cytometry for circulating levels of human B ceils, we observed a complete depletion of the B-cell population even with treatments as short as 6 hours (Figure 17).
