Example 236
3-(2-Methoxy-2-methylpropyl)-5-methyl-6-[(2-oxoimidazolidin-1-yl)methyl]-1-(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione
310 mg (0.575 mmol) of the compound from Example 322A were dissolved in 30 ml of dioxane, and 144 mg (0.863 mmol) of CDI were added. The mixture was stirred at RT for 19 h. The reaction solution was then concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residue was dissolved in 6 ml of DMSO and this solution was purified by means of preparative HPLC (Method 14). Combination of the product fractions and freeze-drying gave 172 mg (62% of theory) of the title compound
