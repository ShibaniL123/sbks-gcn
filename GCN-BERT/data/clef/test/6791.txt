Method B:
To a solution of 440 g (2.37 mol) of ethyl 2-amino-4-methylthiophene-3-carboxylate in 4.4 litres of THF were added, at RT, 1.32 litres (9.50 mol) of triethylamine and 770 g (4.75 mol) of N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI). After 4 days, 4.75 litres (9.50 mol) of a 2 M solution of ethylamine in THF were added to the reaction mixture. After a reaction time of 2 h, the mixture was stirred into about 27 litres of water. The product which precipitated out was filtered off with suction, washed with a little water and dried under high vacuum. 578 g (95% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
