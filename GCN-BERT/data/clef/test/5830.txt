This application is a divisional of U.S. Ser. No. 13/575,458, filed Jul. 26, 2012, which is a ยง371 National Stage Application of PCT/US2011/000153, filed Jan. 27, 2011, which claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Application 61/336,835, filed Jan. 27, 2010, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to processes and intermediates useful in the preparation of (R)-2-(7-(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetic acid of Formula (Ia) or salts thereof, an S1P1 receptor modulator that is useful in the treatment of S1P1 receptor-associated disorders, for example, diseases and disorders mediated by lymphocytes, transplant rejection, autoimmune diseases and disorders, inflammatory diseases and disorders (e.g., acute and chronic inflammatory conditions), cancer, and conditions characterized by an underlying defect in vascular integrity or that are associated with angiogenesis such as may be pathologic (e.g., as may occur in inflammation, tumor development and atherosclerosis). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION S1P1 receptor agonists have been shown to possess at least immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory, and/or hemostatic activities, e.g. by virtue of modulating leukocyte trafficking, sequestering lymphocytes in secondary lymphoid tissues, and/or enhancing vascular integrity. Accordingly, S1P1 receptor agonists can be useful as immunosuppressive agents for at least autoimmune diseases and disorders; inflammatory diseases and disorders (e.g., acute and chronic inflammatory conditions), transplant rejection, cancer, and/or conditions that have an underlying defect in vascular integrity or that are associated with angiogenesis such as may be pathologic (e.g., as may occur in inflammation, tumor development, and atherosclerosis) with fewer side effects such as the impairment of immune responses to systemic infection. The sphingosine-1-phosphate (SIP) receptors 1-5 constitute a family of G protein-coupled receptors containing a seven-transmembrane domain. These receptors, referred to as S1P1 to S1P5 (formerly termed endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) receptor-1, -5, -3, -6, and -8, respectively; Chun et al., Pharmacological Reviews, 54:265-269, 2002), are activated via binding by sphingosine-1-phosphate, which is produced by the sphingosine kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of sphingosine. S1P1, S1P4, and S1P5 receptors activate Gi but not Gq, whereas S1P2 and S1P3 receptors activate both Gi and Gq. The S1P3 receptor, but not the S1P1 receptor, responds to an agonist with an increase in intracellular calcium. In view of the growing demand for S1P1 agonists useful in the treatment of S1P1 receptor-associated disorders, the compound (R)-2-(7-(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetic acid of Formula (Ia): has emerged as an important new compound, see PCT patent application, Serial No. PCT/US2009/004265 hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The processes and compounds described herein help meet these and other needs.

One aspect of the present invention pertains to the L-arginine salt of (R)-2-(7-(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetic acid of Formula (Ia) or a salt thereof, prepared according to any of the processes described herein, for use in a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition for treating an S1P1 receptor-associated disorder in an individual. Indications S1P1 receptor agonists having agonist activity on the S1P1 receptor have been shown to rapidly and reversibly induce lymphopenia (also referred to as peripheral lymphocyte lowering (PLL); Hale et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 14:3351-3355, 2004). This is attended by clinically useful immunosuppression by virtue of sequestering T- and B-cells in secondary lymphoid tissue (lymph nodes and Peyer's patches) and thus apart from sites of inflammation and organ grafts (Rosen et al., Immunol. Rev., 195:160-177, 2003; Schwab et al., Nature Immunol., 8:1295-1301, 2007). This lymphocyte sequestration, for example in lymph nodes, is thought to be a consequence of concurrent agonist-driven functional antagonism of the S1P1 receptor on T-cells (whereby the ability of S1P1 to mobilize T-cell egress from lymph nodes is reduced) and persistent agonism of the S1P1 receptor on lymph node endothelium (such that barrier function opposing transmigration of lymphocytes is increased) (Matloubian et al., Nature, 427:355-360, 2004; Baumruker et al, Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs, 16:283-289, 2007). It has been reported that agonism of the S1P receptor alone is sufficient to achieve lymphocyte sequestration (Sanna et al., J Biol. Chem., 279:13839-13848, 2004) and that this occurs without impairment of immune responses to systemic infection (Brinkmann et al., Transplantation, 72:764-769, 2001; Brinkmann et al., Transplant Proc., 33:530-531, 2001). That agonism of endothelial S1P1 receptors has a broader role in promoting vascular integrity is supported by work implicating the S1P1 receptor in capillary integrity in mouse skin and lung (Sanna et al., Nat Chem. Biol., 2:434-441, 2006). Vascular integrity can be compromised by inflammatory processes, for example as may derive from sepsis, major trauma and surgery so as to lead to acute lung injury or respiratory distress syndrome (Johan Groeneveld, Vascul. Pharmacol., 39:247-256, 2003). An exemplary S1P receptor agonist having agonist activity on the S1P1 receptor is FTY720 (fingolimod), an immunosuppressive agent currently in clinical trials (Martini et al., Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs, 16:505-518, 2007). FTY720 acts as a prodrug which is phosphorylated in vivo; the phosphorylated derivative is an agonist for S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5 receptors (but not the S1P2 receptor) (Chiba, Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 108:308-319, 2005). FTY720 has been shown to rapidly and reversibly induce lymphopenia (also referred to as peripheral lymphocyte lowering (PLL); Hale et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 14:3351-3355, 2004). This is attended by clinically useful immunosuppression by virtue of sequestering T- and B-cells in secondary lymphoid tissue (lymph nodes and Peyer's patches) and thus apart from sites of inflammation and organ grafts (Rosen et al., Immunol. Rev., 195:160-177, 2003; Schwab et al., Nature Immunol., 8:1295-1301, 2007). In clinical trials, FTY720 elicited an adverse event (i.e., transient asymptomatic bradycardia) due to its agonism of the S1P3 receptor (Budde et al., J. Am. Soc. Nephrol., 13:1073-1083, 2002; Sanna et al., J. Biol. Chem., 279:13839-13848, 2004; Ogawa et al., BBRC, 361:621-628, 2007). FTY720 has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy in at least: a rat model for autoimmune myocarditis and a mouse model for acute viral myocarditis (Kiyabayashi et al., J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol., 35:410-416, 2000; Miyamoto et al, J. Am. Coll. Cardiol., 37:1713-1718, 2001); mouse models for inflammatory bowel disease including colitis (Mizushina et al., Inflamm. Bowel Dis., 10:182-192, 2004; Deguchi et al., Oncology Reports, 16:699-703, 2006; Fujii et al, Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol., 291:G267-G274, 2006; Daniel et al., J. Immunol., 178:2458-2468, 2007); a rat model for progressive mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis (Martini et al., Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol., 292:F1761-F1770, 2007); a mouse model for asthma, suggested to be primarily through the S1P1 receptor on the basis of work using the S1P1 receptor agonist SEW2871 (Idzko et al, J. Clin. Invest., 116:2935-2944, 2006); a mouse model for airway inflammation and induction of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (Sawicka et al., J. Immunol., 171; 6206-6214, 2003); a mouse model for atopic dermatitis (Kohno et al., Biol. Pharm. Bull., 27:1392-1396, 2004); a mouse model for ischemia-reperfusion injury (Kaudel et al., Transplant. Proc, 39:499-502, 2007); a mouse model for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (Okazaki et al., J. Rheumatol., 29:707-716, 2002; Herzinger et al., Am. J. Clin. Dermatol., 8:329-336, 2007); rat models for rheumatoid arthritis (Matsuura et al., Int. J. Immunopharmacol., 22:323-331, 2000; Matsuura et al, Inflamm. Res., 49:404-410, 2000); a rat model for autoimmune uveitis (Kurose et al., Exp. Eye Res., 70:7-15, 2000); mouse models for type I diabetes (Fu et al., Transplantation, 73:1425-1430, 2002; Maid et al., Transplantation, 74:1684-1686, 2002; Yang et al., Clinical Immunology, 107:30-35, 2003; Maki et al., Transplantation, 79:1051-1055, 2005); mouse models for atherosclerosis (Nofer et al., Circulation, 115:501-508, 2007; Keul et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., 27:607-613, 2007); a rat model for brain inflammatory reaction following traumatic brain injury (TBI) (Zhang et al., J. Cell. Mol. Med., 11:307-314, 2007); and mouse models for graft coronary artery disease and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (Hwang et al., Circulation, 100:1322-1329, 1999; Taylor et al., Blood, 110:3480-3488, 2007). In vitro results suggest that FTY720 may have therapeutic efficacy for ฮฒ-amyloid-related inflammatory diseases including Alzheimer's disease (Kaneider et al., FASEB J, 18:309-311, 2004). KRP-203, an S1P1 receptor agonist having agonist activity on the S1P1 receptor, has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy in a rat model for autoimmune myocarditis (Ogawa et al., BBRC, 361:621-628, 2007). Using the S1P1 receptor agonist SEW2871, it has been shown that agonism of endothelial SIP I receptors prevents proinflammatory monocyte/endothelial interactions in type I diabetic vascular endothelium (Whetzel et al., Circ. Res., 99:731-739, 2006) and protects the vasculature against TNFฮฑ-mediated monocyte/endothelial interactions (Bolick et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol., 25:976-981, 2005). Additionally, FTY720 has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in rats and mice, a model for human multiple sclerosis (Brinkmann et al., J. Biol. Chem., 277:21453-21457, 2002; Fujino et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 305:70-77, 2003; Webb et al., J. Neuroimmunol., 153:108-121, 2004; Rausch et al., J. Magn. Reson. Imaging, 20:16-24, 2004; Kataoka et al., Cellular & Molecular Immunology, 2:439-448, 2005; Brinkmann et al., Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 115:84-105, 2007; Baumruker et al., Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs, 16:283-289, 2007; Balatoni et al., Brain Research Bulletin, 74:307-316, 2007). Furthermore, FTY720 has been found to have therapeutic efficacy for multiple sclerosis in clinical trials. In Phase II clinical trials for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, FTY720 was found to reduce the number of lesions detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis (Kappos et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 355:1124-1140, 2006; Martini et al., Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs, 16:505-518, 2007; Zhang et al., Mini-Reviews in Medicinal Chemistry, 7:845-850, 2007; Brinkmann, Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 115:84-105, 2007). FTY720 is currently in Phase III studies of remitting-relapsing multiple sclerosis (Brinkmann, Pharmacology & Therapeutics, 115:84-105, 2007; Baumruker et al., Expert. Opin. Investig. Drugs, 16:283-289, 2007; Dev et al., Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 117:77-93, 2008). Recently, FTY720 has been reported to have anti-viral activity. Specific data has been presented in the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) mouse model, wherein the mice were infected with either the Armstrong or the clone 13 strain of LCMV (Premenko-Lanier et al., Nature, 454, 894, 2008). FTY720 has been reported to impair migration of dendritic cells infected with Francisella tularensis to the mediastinal lymph node, thereby reducing the bacterial colonization of it. Francisella tularensis is associated with tularemia, ulceroglandular infection, respiratory infection and a typhoidal disease (E. Bar-Haim et al., PLoS Pathog 4(11): e1000211. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000211, 2008). It has also been recently reported that a short-term high dose of FTY720 rapidly reduced ocular infiltrates in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis. When given in the early stages of ocular inflammation, FTY720 rapidly prevented retinal damage. It was reported to not only prevent infiltration of target organs, but also reduce existing infiltration (Raveney et al., Arch. Ophthalmol. 126(10), 1390, 2008). It has been reported that treatment with FTY720 relieved ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in mice by reducing the number of mature osteoclasts attached to the bone surface. The data provided evidence that S1P1 controlled the migratory behaviour of osteoclast precursors, dynamically regulating bone mineral homeostasis (Ishii et al., Nature, 458(7237), 524-528, 2009). Agonism of the S1P1 receptor has been implicated in enhancement of survival of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Survival of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells is a required component of the remyelination process. Remyelination of multiple sclerosis lesions is considered to promote recovery from clinical relapses. (Miron et al., Ann. Neurol., 63:61-71, 2008; Coelho et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 323:626-635, 2007; Dev et al., Pharmacology and Therapeutics, 117:77-93, 2008). It also has been shown that the S1P1 receptor plays a role in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced oligodendrocyte progenitor cell mitogenesis (Jung et al., Glia, 55:1656-1667, 2007). Agonism of the S1P1 receptor has also been reported to mediate migration of neural stem cells toward injured areas of the central nervous system (CNS), including in a rat model of spinal cord injury (Kimura et al., Stem Cells, 25:115-124, 2007). Agonism of the S1P1 receptor has been implicated in the inhibition of keratinocyte proliferation (Sauer et al, J. Biol. Chem., 279:38471-38479, 2004), consistent with reports that S1P1 inhibits keratinocyte proliferation (Kim et al., Cell Signal, 16:89-95, 2004). The hyperproliferation of keratinocytes at the entrance to the hair follicle, which can then become blocked, and an associated inflammation are significant pathogenetic factors of acne (Koreck et al., Dermatology, 206:96-105, 2003; Webster, Cutis, 76:4-7, 2005). FTY720 has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy in inhibiting pathologic angiogenesis, such as that as may occur in tumor development. Inhibition of angiogenesis by FTY720 is thought to involve agonism of the S1P1 receptor (Oo et al., J. Biol. Chem., 282; 9082-9089, 2007; Schmid et al., J. Cell Biochem., 101:259-270, 2007). FTY720 has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy for inhibiting primary and metastatic tumor growth in a mouse model of melanoma (LaMontagne et al., Cancer Res., 66:221-231, 2006). FTY720 has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy in a mouse model for metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (Lee et al., Clin. Cancer Res., 11:84588466, 2005). It has been reported that oral administration of FTY720 to mice potently blocked VEGF-induced vascular permeability, an important process associated with angiogenesis, inflammation, and pathological conditions such as sepsis, hypoxia, and solid tumor growth (T Sanchez et al., J. Biol. Chem., 278(47), 47281-47290, 2003). Cyclosporin A and FK506 (calcineurin inhibitors) are drugs used to prevent rejection of transplanted organs. Although they are effective in delaying or suppressing transplant rejection, classical immunosuppressants such as cyclosporin A and FK506 are known to cause several undesirable side effects including nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, ฮฒ-cell toxicity and gastrointestinal discomfort. There is an unmet need in organ transplantation for an immunosuppressant without these side effects which is effective as a monotherapy or in combination with a classical immunosuppressant for inhibiting migration of, e.g., alloantigen-reactive T-cells to the grafted tissue, thereby prolonging graft survival. FTY720 has been shown to have therapeutic efficacy in transplant rejection both as a monotherapy and in synergistic combination with a classical immunosuppressant, including cyclosporin A, FK506 and RAD (an mTOR inhibitor). It has been shown that, unlike the classical immunosuppressants cyclosporin A, FK506 and RAD, FTY720 has efficacy for prolonging graft survival without inducing general immunosuppression, and this difference in drug action is believed to be relevant to the synergism observed for the combination (Brinkmann et al., Transplant Proc., 33:530-531, 2001; Brinkmann et al, Transplantation, 72:764-769, 2001). Agonism of the S1P1 receptor has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy for prolonging allograft survival in mouse and rat skin allograft models (Lima et al., Transplant Proc., 36:1015-1017, 2004; Yan et al., Bioorg. & Med. Chem. Lett., 16:3679-3683, 2006). FTY720 has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy for prolonging allograft survival in a rat cardiac allograft model (Suzuki et al., Transpl. Immunol., 4:252-255, 1996). FTY720 has been reported to act synergistically with cyclosporin A to prolong rat skin allograft survival (Yanagawa et al., J. Immunol., 160:5493-5499, 1998), to act synergistically with cyclosporin A and with FK506 to prolong rat cardiac allograft survival, and to act synergistically with cyclosporin A to prolong canine renal allograft survival and monkey renal allograft survival (Chiba et al., Cell Mol. Biol., 3:11-19, 2006). KRP-203, an S1P receptor agonist has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy for prolonging allograft survival in a rat skin allograft model and both as monotherapy and in synergistic combination with cyclosporin A in a rat cardiac allograft model (Shimizu et al., Circulation, 111:222-229, 2005). KRP-203 also has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF; a prodrug for which the active metabolite is mycophenolic acid, an inhibitor of purine biosynthesis) for prolonging allograft survival both in a rat renal allograft model and in a rat cardiac allograft model (Suzuki et al., J. Heart Lung Transplant, 25:302-209, 2006; Fujishiro et al., J. Heart Lung Transplant, 25:825-833, 2006). It has been reported that an agonist of the S1P1 receptor, AUY954, in combination with a subtherapeutic dose of RAD001 (Certican/Everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor) can prolong rat cardiac allograft survival (Pan et al., Chemistry & Biology, 13:1227-1234, 2006). In a rat small bowel allograft model, FTY720 has been reported to act synergistically with cyclosporin A to prolong small bowel allograft survival (Sakagawa et al., Transpl. Immunol., 13:161-168, 2004). FTY720 has been reported to have therapeutic efficacy in a mouse islet graft model (Fu et al., Transplantation, 73:1425-1430, 2002; Liu et al., Microsurgery, 27:300-304; 2007) and in a study using human islet cells to evidence no detrimental effects on human islet function (Truong et al., American Journal of Transplantation, 7:2031-2038, 2007). FTY720 has been reported to reduce the nociceptive behavior in the spared nerve injury model for neuropathic pain which does not depend on prostaglandin synthesis (O. Costu et al., Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine 12(3), 995-1004, 2008). FTY720 has been reported to impair initiation of murine contact hypersensitivity (CHS). Adoptive transfer of immunized lymph node cells from mice treated with FTY720 during the sensitization phase was virtually incapable of inducing CHS response in recipients (D. Nakashima et al., J. Investigative Dermatology (128(12), 2833-2841, 2008). It has been reported that prophylactic oral administration of FTY720 (1 mg/kg, three times a week), completely prevented the development of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) in C57BL/6 mice (T. Kohono et al., Biological & Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 28(4), 736-739, 2005). In one embodiment, the present invention encompasses compounds which are agonists of the S1P1 receptor having selectivity over the S1P3 receptor. The S1P3 receptor, and not the S1P1 receptor, has been directly implicated in bradycardia (Sanna et al., J. Biol. Chem., 279:13839-13848, 2004). An S1P1 receptor agonist selective over at least the S1P3 receptor has advantages over current therapies by virtue of an enhanced therapeutic window, allowing better tolerability with higher dosing and thus improving efficacy as therapy. The present invention encompasses compounds which are agonists of the S1P1 receptor and which exhibit no or substantially no activity for bradycardia. S1P1 receptor agonists are useful for treating or preventing conditions where suppression of the immune system or agonism of the S1P1 receptor is in order, such as diseases and disorders mediated by lymphocytes, transplant rejection, autoimmune diseases and disorders, inflammatory diseases and disorders, and conditions that have an underlying defect in vascular integrity or that relate to angiogenesis such as may be pathologic. S1P1 receptor agonists are useful for treating or preventing conditions where suppression of the immune system or agonism of the S1P1 receptor is in order, such as diseases and disorders mediated by lymphocytes, transplant rejection, autoimmune diseases and disorders, inflammatory diseases and disorders (e.g., acute and chronic inflammatory conditions), cancer, and conditions that have an underlying defect in vascular integrity or that are associated with angiogenesis such as may be pathologic (e.g., as may occur in inflammation, tumor development and atherosclerosis). Such conditions where suppression of the immune system or agonism of the S1P1 receptor is in order include diseases and disorders mediated by lymphocytes; conditions that have an underlying defect in vascular integrity; autoimmune diseases and disorders; inflammatory diseases and disorders (e.g., acute and chronic inflammatory conditions); acute or chronic rejection of cells; tissue or solid organ grafts; arthritis, including psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis; diabetes, including type I diabetes; demyelinating disease, including multiple sclerosis; ischemia-reperfusion injury, including renal and cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury; inflammatory skin disease, including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and acne; hyperproliferative skin disease, including acne; inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis; systemic lupus erythematosis; asthma; uveitis; myocarditis; allergy; atherosclerosis; brain inflammation, including Alzheimer's disease, and brain inflammatory reaction following traumatic brain injury; central nervous system disease, including spinal cord injury, or cerebral infarction; pathologic angiogenesis, including as may occur in primary and metastatic tumor growth; rheumatoid arthritis; diabetic retinopathy, atherosclerosis; cancer; chronic pulmonary disease; acute lung injury; acute respiratory disease syndrome; sepsis; and the like. In addition, S1P1 receptor agonists are useful for treating microbial infections, and viral infections or diseases.

Pharmaceutical Compositions One aspect of the present invention pertains to compounds represented by any of the formulae described herein used in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions. A further aspect of the present invention pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. Some embodiments pertain to pharmaceutical compositions comprising Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Some embodiments of the present invention include a method of producing a pharmaceutical composition comprising admixing Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Formulations may be prepared by any suitable method, typically by uniformly mixing Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof with liquids or finely divided solid carriers, or both, in the required proportions and then, if necessary, forming the resulting mixture into a desired shape. Conventional excipients, such as binding agents, fillers, acceptable wetting agents, tabletting lubricants and disintegrants may be used in tablets and capsules for oral administration. Liquid preparations for oral administration may be in the form of solutions, emulsions, aqueous or oily suspensions and syrups. Alternatively, the oral preparations may be in the form of a dry powder that can be reconstituted with water or another suitable liquid vehicle before use. Additional additives such as suspending or emulsifying agents, non-aqueous vehicles (including edible oils), preservatives and flavorings and colorants may be added to the liquid preparations. Parenteral dosage forms may be prepared by dissolving Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in a suitable liquid vehicle and filter sterilizing the solution before filling and sealing an appropriate vial or ampule. These are just a few examples of the many appropriate methods well known in the art for preparing dosage forms. Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions using techniques well known to those in the art. Suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, outside those mentioned herein, are known in the art; for example, see Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition, 2000, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, (Editors: Gennaro et all) While it is possible that, for use in treatment, Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may, in an alternative use, be administered as a raw or pure chemical, it is preferable however to present the active ingredient as a pharmaceutical formulation or composition further comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The invention thus further relates to pharmaceutical formulations comprising Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof and/or prophylactic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be โacceptableโ in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not overly deleterious to the recipient thereof. Typical procedures for making and identifying suitable hydrates and solvates, outside those mentioned herein, are well known to those in the art; see for example, pages 202-209 of K. J. Guillory, โGeneration of Polymorphs, Hydrates, Solvates, and Amorphous Solids,โ in: Polymorphism in Pharmaceutical Solids, ed. Harry G. Brittain, Vol. 95, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1999. Pharmaceutical formulations include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sub-lingual), vaginal or parenteral (including intramuscular, sub-cutaneous and intravenous) administration or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation, insufflation or by a transdermal patch. Transdermal patches dispense a drug at a controlled rate by presenting the drug for absorption in an efficient manner with a minimum of degradation of the drug. Typically, transdermal patches comprise an impermeable backing layer, a single pressure sensitive adhesive and a removable protective layer with a release liner. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand and appreciate the techniques appropriate for manufacturing a desired efficacious transdermal patch based upon the needs of the artisan. Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a conventional adjuvant, carrier, or diluent, may thus be placed into the form of pharmaceutical formulations and unit dosages thereof and in such form may be employed as solids, such as tablets or filled capsules, or liquids such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, gels or capsules filled with the same, all for oral use, in the form of suppositories for rectal administration; or in the form of sterile injectable solutions for parenteral (including subcutaneous) use. Such pharmaceutical compositions and unit dosage forms thereof may comprise conventional ingredients in conventional proportions, with or without additional active ingredients and such unit dosage forms may contain any suitable effective amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended daily dosage range to be employed. For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of, for example, a tablet, capsule, suspension or liquid. The pharmaceutical composition is preferably made in the form of a dosage unit containing a particular amount of the active ingredient. Examples of such dosage units are capsules, tablets, powders, granules or suspensions, with conventional additives such as lactose, mannitol, corn starch or potato starch; with binders such as crystalline cellulose, cellulose derivatives, acacia, corn starch or gelatins; with disintegrators such as corn starch, potato starch or sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose; and with lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate. The active ingredient may also be administered by injection as a composition wherein, for example, saline, dextrose or water may be used as a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Compound of Formula (Ia) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as active ingredients in pharmaceutical compositions, specifically as S1P1 receptor modulators. The term โactive ingredientโ in the context of a โpharmaceutical compositionโ is intended to mean a component of a pharmaceutical composition that provides the primary pharmacological effect, as opposed to an โinactive ingredientโ which would generally be recognized as providing no pharmaceutical benefit. The dose when using Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can vary within wide limits and as is customary and as is known to the physician, it is to be tailored to the individual conditions in each individual case. It depends, for example, on the nature and severity of the illness to be treated; on the condition of the patient; on the formulation employed; on whether an acute or chronic disease state is treated, or prophylaxis is conducted; or on whether further active ingredients are administered in addition to Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Representative doses of the present invention include, but are not limited to, about 0.001 mg to about 5000 mg, about 0.001 mg to about 2500 mg, about 0.001 mg to about 1000 mg, 0.001 mg to about 500 mg, 0.001 mg to about 250 mg, about 0.001 mg to 100 mg, about 0.001 mg to about 50 mg and about 0.001 mg to about 25 mg. Multiple doses may be administered during the day, especially when relatively large amounts are deemed to be needed, for example two, three or four doses. Depending on the individual and as deemed appropriate from the patient's physician or caregiver it may be necessary to deviate upward or downward from the doses described herein. The amount of active ingredient required for use in treatment will vary not only with the particular ingredient selected but also with the route of administration, the nature of the condition being treated and the age and condition of the patient and will ultimately be at the discretion of the attendant physician or clinician. In general, one skilled in the art understands how to extrapolate in vivo data obtained in a model system, typically an animal model, to another, such as a human. In some circumstances, these extrapolations may merely be based on the weight of the animal model in comparison to another, such as a mammal, preferably a human, however, more often, these extrapolations are not simply based on weights, but rather incorporate a variety of factors. Representative factors include the type, age, weight, sex, diet and medical condition of the patient, the severity of the disease, the route of administration, pharmacological considerations such as the activity, efficacy, pharmacokinetic and toxicology profiles of the particular active ingredient employed, whether a drug delivery system is utilized, on whether an acute or chronic disease state is being treated or prophylaxis is conducted or on whether further active ingredients are administered in addition to Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as part of a drug combination. The dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is selected in accordance with a variety factors as cited above. Thus, the actual dosage regimen employed may vary widely and therefore may deviate from a preferred dosage regimen and one skilled in the art will recognize that dosages and dosage regimens outside these typical ranges can be tested and, where appropriate, may be used in the methods described herein. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example, as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. The sub-dose itself may be further divided, for example, into a number of discrete loosely spaced administrations. The daily dose can be divided, especially when relatively large amounts are administered as deemed appropriate, into several, for example, two, three or four part administrations. If appropriate, depending on individual behavior, it may be necessary to deviate upward or downward from the daily dose indicated. Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be administrated in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the following dosage forms may comprise, as the active component, either Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. For preparing pharmaceutical compositions from Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier can be either solid, liquid or a mixture of both. Solid form preparations include powders, tablets, pills, capsules, cachets, suppositories and dispersible granules. A solid carrier can be one or more substances which may also act as diluents, flavoring agents, solubilizers, lubricants, suspending agents, binders, preservatives, tablet disintegrating agents, or an encapsulating material. In powders, the carrier is a finely divided solid which is in a mixture with the finely divided active component. In tablets, the active component is mixed with the carrier having the necessary binding capacity in suitable proportions and compacted to the desired shape and size. The powders and tablets may contain varying percentages of the active ingredient. A representative amount in a powder or tablet may contain from 0.5 to about 90 percent of the active ingredient; however, an artisan would know when amounts outside of this range are necessary. Suitable carriers for powders and tablets are magnesium carbonate, magnesium stearate, talc, sugar, lactose, pectin, dextrin, starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, a low melting wax, cocoa butter and the like. The term โpreparationโ is intended to include the formulation of the active ingredient with encapsulating material as a carrier providing a capsule in which the active component, with or without carriers, is surrounded by a carrier, and which is thus in association with it. Similarly, cachets and lozenges are included. Tablets, powders, capsules, pills, cachets and lozenges can be used as solid forms suitable for oral administration. For preparing suppositories, a low melting wax, such as an admixture of fatty acid glycerides or cocoa butter, is first melted and the active component is dispersed homogeneously therein, as by stirring. The molten homogenous mixture is then poured into convenient sized molds, allowed to cool and thereby to solidify. Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams or sprays containing, in addition to the active ingredient, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. Liquid form preparations include solutions, suspensions and emulsions, for example, water or water-propylene glycol solutions. For example, parenteral injection liquid preparations can be formulated as solutions in aqueous polyethylene glycol solution. Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may thus be formulated for parenteral administration (e.g. by injection, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion) and may be presented in unit dose form in ampoules, pre-filled syringes, small volume infusion or in multi-dose containers with an added preservative. The pharmaceutical compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form, obtained by aseptic isolation of sterile solid or by lyophilization from solution, for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use. Aqueous formulations suitable for oral use can be prepared by dissolving or suspending the active component in water and adding suitable colorants, flavors, stabilizing and thickening agents, as desired. Aqueous suspensions suitable for oral use can be made by dispersing the finely divided active component in water with viscous material, such as natural or synthetic gums, resins, methylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or other well-known suspending agents. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations for oral administration. Such liquid forms include solutions, suspensions and emulsions. These preparations may contain, in addition to the active component, colorants, flavors, stabilizers, buffers, artificial and natural sweeteners, dispersants, thickeners, solubilizing agents and the like. For topical administration to the epidermis Compound of Formula (a) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be formulated as ointments, creams or lotions, or as a transdermal patch. Ointments and creams may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilizing agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, thickening agents, or coloring agents. Formulations suitable for topical administration in the mouth include lozenges comprising active agent in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier. Solutions or suspensions are applied directly to the nasal cavity by conventional means, for example with a dropper, pipette or spray. The formulations may be provided in single or multi-dose form. In the latter case of a dropper or pipette, this may be achieved by the patient administering an appropriate, predetermined volume of the solution or suspension. In the case of a spray, this may be achieved for example by means of a metering atomizing spray pump. Administration to the respiratory tract may also be achieved by means of an aerosol formulation in which the active ingredient is provided in a pressurized pack with a suitable propellant. If Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or pharmaceutical compositions comprising them are administered as aerosols, for example as nasal aerosols or by inhalation, this can be carried out, for example, using a spray, a nebulizer, a pump nebulizer, an inhalation apparatus, a metered inhaler or a dry powder inhaler. Pharmaceutical forms for administration of Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof as an aerosol can be prepared by processes well known to the person skilled in the art. For their preparation, for example, solutions or dispersions of Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in water, water/alcohol mixtures or suitable saline solutions can be employed using customary additives, for example benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption enhancers for increasing the bioavailability, solubilizers, dispersants and others and, if appropriate, customary propellants, for example include carbon dioxide, CFCs, such as, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane; and the like. The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug may be controlled by provision of a metered valve. In formulations intended for administration to the respiratory tract, including intranasal formulations, the pharmaceutical composition will generally have a small particle size for example of the order of 10 microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in the art, for example by micronization. When desired, formulations adapted to give sustained release of the active ingredient may be employed. Alternatively the active ingredients may be provided in the form of a dry powder, for example, a powder mix of the salt in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Conveniently the powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition may be presented in unit dose form for example in capsules or cartridges of, e.g., gelatin, or blister packs from which the powder may be administered by means of an inhaler. The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form. Tablets or capsules for oral administration and liquids for intravenous administration are preferred compositions. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts including pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts may be prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids including inorganic and organic acids. Representative acids include, but are not limited to, acetic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethenesulfonic, dichloroacetic, formic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hippuric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, oxalic, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric, oxalic, p-toluenesulfonic and the like, such as those pharmaceutically acceptable salts listed in Berge, et al., Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences, 66:1-19 (1977). The acid addition salts may be obtained as the direct products of compound synthesis. In the alternative, the free base may be dissolved in a suitable solvent containing the appropriate acid and the salt isolated by evaporating the solvent or otherwise separating the salt and solvent. Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may form solvates with standard low molecular weight solvents using methods known to the skilled artisan. Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be converted to โpro-drugs.โ The term โpro-drugsโ refers to compounds that have been modified with specific chemical groups known in the art and when administered into an individual these groups undergo biotransformation to give the parent compound. Pro-drugs can thus be viewed as compounds containing one or more specialized non-toxic protective groups used in a transient manner to alter or to eliminate a property of the compound. In one general aspect, the โpro-drugโ approach is utilized to facilitate oral absorption. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series; and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987. Some embodiments of the present invention include a method of producing a pharmaceutical composition for โcombination-therapyโ comprising admixing Compound of Formula (Ia) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with at least one known pharmaceutical agent as described herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. It is noted that when S1P1 modulators are utilized as active ingredients in pharmaceutical compositions, these are not intended for use only in humans, but in other non-human mammals as well. Indeed, recent advances in the area of animal health-care mandate that consideration be given for the use of active agents, such as S1P1 modulators, for the treatment of an S1P1-associated disease or disorder in companionship animals (e.g., cats, dogs, etc.) and in livestock animals (e.g., cows, chickens, fish, etc.) Those of ordinary skill in the art are readily credited with understanding the utility of such salts in such settings. Hydrates and Solvates It is understood that when the phrase โpharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and hydratesโ is used in reference to a particular compound herein, it is intended to embrace solvates and/or hydrates of the particular compound, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the particular compound as well as solvates and/or hydrates of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the particular compound. It is also understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art that hydrates are a subgenus of solvates. Compound of Formula (Ia) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and hydrates thereof can be administrated in a wide variety of oral and parenteral dosage forms. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the dosage forms may comprise, as the active component, either Compound of Formula (Ia) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and hydrates thereof. Moreover, various hydrates and solvates of Compound of Formula (Ia) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof will find use as intermediates in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. Typical procedures for making and identifying suitable hydrates and solvates, outside those mentioned herein, are well known to those in the art; see for example, pages 202-209 of K. J. Guillory, โGeneration of Polymorphs, Hydrates, Solvates, and Amorphous Solids,โ in: Polymorphism in Pharmaceutical Solids, ed. Harry G. Brittan, Vol. 95, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1999. Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention relates to processes for preparing hydrates and solvates of Compound of Formula (Ia) and/or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, as described herein, that can be isolated and characterized by methods known in the art, such as, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), TGA-mass spectroscopy, TGA-Infrared spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Karl Fisher titration, high resolution X-ray diffraction, and the like. There are several commercial entities that provide quick and efficient services for identifying solvates and hydrates on a routine basis. Example companies offering these services include Wilmington PharmaTech (Wilmington, Del.), Avantium Technologies (Amsterdam) and Aptuit (Greenwich, Conn.). The invention will be described in greater detail by way of specific examples. The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the invention in any manner. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of noncritical parameters which can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results. EXAMPLES Illustrated syntheses of the present invention are shown in the following examples. The following examples are provided to further define the invention without, however, limiting the invention to the particulars of these examples. The compounds and salts thereof described herein, supra and infra, are named according to the CS ChemDraw Ultra Version 7.0.1, AutoNom version 2.2, or CS ChemDraw Ultra Version 9.0.7. In certain instances common names are used and it is understood that these common names would be recognized by those skilled in the art.

Example 1 Preparation of 1-Cyclopentyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (Compound of Formula (IIb)) Method 1 Preparation of 1-Cyclopentyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (Compound of Formula (IIb)), 500 g Scale Reaction To a 10 L jacketed reactor was added dry THF (2.4 L) and magnesium turnings (81.0 g, 3.33 mol, 1.5 eq.) under N2. In a separate flask FeCl3 (36 g, 0.22 mol, 0.1 eq.) was dissolved in THF (150 mL) (caution, exothermic) under N2. This dark brown solution was allowed to cool to ambient temperature and then added over 10 min to the reactor content under N2 at an internal temperature of about 10ยฐ C. TMEDA (402 mL) was added to this yellow/green mixture keeping the internal temperature below about 20ยฐ C. (slightly exothermic). The resulting rust brown mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 1 h under N2 then 1 h at 45ยฐ C. The reactor contents were allowed to cool below about 20ยฐ C. and a mixture of 1-bromo-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (500 g, 2.22 mol) and bromocyclopentane (397 g, 2.66 mol, 1.2 eq.) added dropwise under N2 at a rate as to maintain the internal temperature between about 25-30ยฐ C. After the addition, the reaction mixture was stirred at about 25ยฐ C. under N2 overnight, allowed to cool to an internal temperature of about 0ยฐ C. and quenched with 6 N HCl (2 L) at a rate as to maintain the internal temperature below about 15ยฐ C. (caution, exothermic). [Note: IPC's after completing the addition and stirring overnight were similar indicating that the reaction may have been completed much sooner.] After the quench, hexane (3 L) was added and the reactor contents were stirred at ambient temperature for 1 h. The phases were separated and the aqueous layer back extracted with hexane (1 L). The combined organic layers were dried (Na2SO4), slurried with silica (750 g) and filtered washing the solids with hexane (1 L). The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure (100 torr at 37ยฐ C.) to give an amber oil (317 g, 97.3 Area % by HPLC, 87.7 wt % by HPLC (contained residual hexane by NMR), corrected yield 58%) which was used in the next step without further purification. Method 2 Preparation of 1-Cyclopentyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (Compound of Formula (Ib)), 1.5 kg Scale Reaction To a 30 L jacketed reactor, dry THF (6 L) and magnesium turnings (243.0 g, 10 mol, 1.5 eq.) were added under N2. In a separate flask, FeCl3 (162 g, 1.0 mol, 0.15 eq.) was dissolved in THF (800 mL) (caution, exothermic) under N2. This dark brown solution was cooled to ambient temperature using an ice bath and then added over 35 min to the 30 L reactor contents under N2 at an internal temperature of 10ยฐ C. To this yellow/green mixture, TMEDA (1.2 L) was added keeping the internal temperature below 20ยฐ C. (slightly exothermic). The resulting rust brown mixture was stirred at 45ยฐ C. for 1 h under N2. The reactor content was allowed to cool below 20ยฐ C. and a mixture of 1-bromo-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (1500 g, 6.67 mol) and bromocyclopentane (1192 g, 8.00 mol, 1.2 eq.) added dropwise under N2 at such a rate as to maintain the internal temperature between 25-30ยฐ C. (caution, exothermic). After the addition (3.33 h) and the exotherm subsided, the reaction mixture was stirred at 25ยฐ C. under N2 overnight, allowed to cool to an internal temperature of 0ยฐ C. and quenched with 6 NHCL (3 L, 1.5 h) at such a rate as to maintain the internal temperature below 15ยฐ C. (caution, very exothermic). After the quench, ethyl acetate (4 L) was added and the reactor content stirred at ambient temperature for 1 h. The phases were separated and the aqueous layer back extracted with ethyl acetate (2.5 L). The combined organic layers were washed with H2O (1 L), brine (1.5 L) and dried (Na2SO4). The solvent was rotary evaporated at 35ยฐ C. and the residue fraction distilled under high vacuum (65-70ยฐ C., 0.15 Torr) to give 823 g of product (58%, not wt % corrected) as a clear colorless liquid. 1H NMR (Bruker, 400 MHz, DMSO-d6) ฮด ppm 7.58-7.64 (m, 3H, ArH), 7.34-7.4 (m, 1H, ArH), 3.21-3.29 (m, 1H, โCH), 1.95-2.04 (m, 2H, โCH2), 1.76-1.88 (m, 2H, โCH2), 1.49-1.71 (m, 4H, โCH2). Method 3 Preparation of 1-Cyclopentyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (Compound of Formula (IIb)), Two Step Process Using 1-bromo-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene Step A: Preparation of 1-(2-(Trifluoromethyl)phenyl)cyclopentanol A solution of 1-bromo-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (0.5 g, 2.222 mmol) in anhydrous THF (10 mL) was cooled to โ78ยฐ C. (dry ice IPA bath) under argon atmosphere. BuLi (2.5 M in hexanes, 1.068 mL, 2.67 mmol) was added in drops with efficient stirring. The reaction mixture was stirred at โ78ยฐ C. for 40 min. A solution of cyclopentanone (0.243 g, 2.89 mmol) in anhydrous THF (1.5 mL) was added slowly (in drops) at โ78ยฐ C. The reaction mixture was stirred at โ78ยฐ C. for 30 min, gradually brought to room temperature, and stirred for 1 h. The reaction mixture was cooled by an ice bath, quenched with water, and acidified to pH 4-5 by addition of concentrated HCl. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in methylene chloride, washed with water (2 times), dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography to give the title compound as an oil (250 mg). LCMS m/z=213.1 [MโH2O+H]+. Step B: Preparation of 1-Cyclopentyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene To a solution of 1-(2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)cyclopentanol (5.1 g, 22.15 mmol) in ethanol (32 mL) was added 10% PdโC (500 mg; Degussa; wet) and the mixture was hydrogenated overnight with a hydrogen balloon. The reaction mixture was filtered through Celiteยฎ. The filtrate was poured into ice-water (100 mL) and extracted with CH2Cl2 (2ร70 mL). The combined CH2Cl2 layer was washed with water (1ร75 mL), dried over Na2SO4, filtered and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to give the title compound (4.3 g). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) ฮด ppm 1.58-1.67 (m, 4H), 1.81-1.90 (m, 2H), 2.06-2.15 (m, 2H), 3.32-3.43 (m, 1H), 7.22-7.26 (m, 1H), 7.45-7.51 (m, 2H), 7.58 (d, J=8 Hz, 1H). Example 2 Preparation of 4-(Chloromethyl)-1-cyclopentyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (Compound of Formula (IIc)) Method 1 Preparation of 4-(Chloromethyl)-1-cyclopentyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (Compound of Formula (IIc)), Use of 1,3,5-trioxane and chlorosulfonic acid To a 5 L jacketed reactor concentrated sulphuric acid (718 mL) was added and cooled to an internal temperature of about โ10ยฐ C. under N2. 1-Cyclopentyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (405 g, 89 wt %, 1.68 mol) was added to the reactor content at once. To the resulting dark brown solution chlorosulfonic acid (225 mL, 3.37 mol, 2 eq.) was added under N2 while maintaining the internal temperature below about โ10ยฐ C. (caution, HCl evolution). Then, 1,3,5-trioxane (606 g, 6.73 mol, 4 eq.) was added at such a rate as to maintain the temperature below about โ10ยฐ C. (caution, delayed exotherm: temperature rose to 17ยฐ C. over 30 min, HCl evolution. Controlling the exotherm minimizes the formation of the dimer (i.e., bis(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl)methane). After the addition and stirring at 0ยฐ C. for 1 h (IPC showed no more starting material) under N2, the reaction mixture was slowly poured over ice water (5 L) with stirring while maintaining the internal temperature below 25ยฐ C. The reactor was rinsed with ice water (1.5 L) and the combined aqueous layers extracted with hexane (3.6 L). The phases were separated and the aqueous layer back extracted with hexane (3.6 L). The combined organic layers were filtered through a pad of Celiteยฎ and washed with saturated NaHCO3 (1.44 L) then water (1.44 L). The organics were concentrated (30 torr at 30ยฐ C.) and the resulting dark brown oil passed through a plug of silica eluting and washing with hexane. The solvent was rotary evaporated (30 torr at 30ยฐ C.) to afford the product (314 g, 81 wt % by NMR, corrected yield 58%) as a yellow oil. A sample of the crude product was further purified by distillation at 72ยฐ C. and 0.12 atm (91 torr) to yield the title compound (98 wt % by HPLC) as a clear colorless oil. The distillation residue contained mostly the dimer species and nearly all of the title compound is recovered in the distillate. Method 2 Preparation of 4-(Chloromethyl)-1-cyclopentyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (Compound of Formula (IIc)), Use of 1,3,5-trioxane and thionyl chloride Sulfuric acid (1.606 L, 3.01 mol) was transferred into the 30 L jacketed reaction vessel, fitted with a temperature probe, a mechanical stirrer, nitrogen inlet and connected to a chiller/heater. The acid was cooled to โ4.5ยฐ C. and thionyl chloride (547 mL, 7.49 mol) was added at โ4.5ยฐ C. via an addition funnel. The reaction temperature was maintained between โ5 to โ3.5ยฐ C. during addition. The mixture was cooled to โ6.5ยฐ C. and 1,3,5-trioxane (506 g, 5.621 mol) added in four batches (126.5 g each batch) maintaining the reaction temperature between โ6.5 to โ2ยฐ C. (addition of trioxane was exothermic). The mixture was cooled to โ5ยฐ C. and 1-cyclopentyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (802.8 g, 3.747 mol) was added slowly via an addition funnel (controlled addition), the addition was exothermic and the temperature was maintained exotherm between โ5 to โ2:5ยฐ C. The reaction was held between โ2.5 to +3.5ยฐ C. for 1.5 and at 5ยฐ C. for 30 min. The reaction mixture was gradually warmed up to 15ยฐ C. and stirred overnight. Analysis of the reaction sample by TLC (5% EtOAc-hexane)) showed only product. Analysis by LC/MS showed the product and the slight presence of the dimer (i.e., bis(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl)methane). The reaction mixture was cooled to โ2ยฐ C. and quenched with controlled addition of water (11 L) and the temperature was maintained below 15ยฐ C. during the aqueous quench (caution: very exothermic).

The solids were washed with 14% water in IPA to give the L-arginine salt of (R)-2-(7-(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetic acid (130 mg). Method 2 Example 8 Preparation of L-Arginine Salt of (R)-2-(7-(4-Cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetic acid Step A: Preparation of 1-Cyclopentyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (Compound of Formula (IIb)) To a 50 L three-neck round-bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermocouple, and nitrogen inlet, was added dry THF (35 L) and cooled to 0-5ยฐ C. To the flask was added Iron (III) chloride (2.7 kg, 0.15 eq) portion wise over 30-60 min. and stirred for 15-30 min. resulting in a clear greenish solution. Under a nitrogen atmosphere in a dry 100 gallon glass lined reactor was added THF (87.5 L) and magnesium turnings (4.05 kg, 1.5 eq), and cooled to 0-5ยฐ C. To the THF and magnesium mixture was added the solution of FeCl3 in THF at a rate to maintain the internal temperature below 10ยฐ C. To the resulting yellow/green mixture was added TMEDA (15.5 kg, 1.2 eq) at a rate to maintain the internal temperature below 20ยฐ C. The resulting reaction mixture was heated to 40-45ยฐ C. for 1 hour and a mixture of 1 bromo-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (25 kg, 1.0 eq) and bromocyclopentane (19.9 kg, 1.2 eq) was added to the reaction mixture at a rate to maintain an internal temperature below 25ยฐ C. The resulting reaction mixture was allowed to stir at room temperature overnight and subsequently cooled to an internal temperature of 0-5ยฐ C. To the resulting mixture was added 6 N HCl (100 L, 1.5 h) at such a rate as to maintain the internal temperature below 15ยฐ C. (caution, very exothermic). After the quench, MTBE (200 L) was added and the reactor contents was stirred for 30 min. The phases were separated and the aqueous layer back extracted with MTBE (75 L). The combined organic layers were washed with H2O (50 L), brine (50 L) and dried (MgSO4). The mixture was filtered through an in-line (1 micron) filter cartridge followed by an additional in-line (0.45 micron) filter cartridge into a clean dry reactor. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum (jacketโฆ30ยฐ C.) and co-evaporated with heptanes (2ร25 L) to provide a viscous liquid. The viscous liquid was dissolved in heptanes (100 L) and passed through a silica plug (25 kg). The silica plug was eluted with heptanes (TLC, Rfห0:8, silica gel, heptanes) and the fractions containing the product were evaporated to provide the title compound as a yellow liquid, 11.7 kg (49.2%), purity as determined by HPLC was 94.1%. 1H NMR conforms to reference standard. Step B: Preparation of 4-(Chloromethyl)-1-cyclopentyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (Compound of Formula (IIc)) To a 100 gallon glass lined reactor equipped with a stirrer was added concentrated sulphuric acid (48.6 L) and cooled to an internal temperature between about โ5 to โ10ยฐ C. under an atmosphere of N2. TO the sulfuric acid was added thionyl chloride (26.99 kg, 2 eq) at a rate to maintain the internal temperature below โ5ยฐ C. To the resulting mixture 1,3,5-trioxane (15.3 kg, 1.5 eq) was added portion wise at a rate to maintain the internal temperature below โ5ยฐ C. After the addition of 1,3,5-trioxane, 1-cyclopentyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (24.0 kg) was added drop wise over a period of approximately 2-3 hours. The reaction mixture was stirred at 0ยฐ C. for approximately 3-4 hours, allowed to warm to room temperature overnight and subsequently cooled to an internal temperature of 0-5ยฐ C. To the resulting mixture was added water (316 L) drop wise over a period of approximately 5-6 hours (Note: Very exothermic). After the quench with water, the resulting aqueous mixture was extracted with MTBE (243 L and 123 L). The combined organics were washed with saturated NaHCO3 (100 L), brine (100 L), water (100 L), brine (100 L), and dried (MgSO4). The mixture was filtered through an in-line (1 micron) filter cartridge followed by an additional in-line (0.45 micron) filter cartridge into a clean dry reactor. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum (jacketโฆ30ยฐ C.) and further evaporated under vacuum at 35-40ยฐ C. The resulting oil was distilled under high vacuum to provide the title compound as a yellow liquid, 24.8 kg (83%), purity as determined by HPLC was 99.47%. 1H NMR conforms to reference standard. Step C: Preparation of Ethyl 2-(2-Morpholinocyclopent-2-enylidene)acetate (Compound of Formula (IIg), Wherein R3 is Ethyl) Cyclopentanone (22.00 kg), morpholine (22.88 kg) and cyclohexane (43.78 kg) were charged to a 400 L glass-lined reactor equipped with overhead agitation, jacket temperature control, a nitrogen inlet, and a Dean-Stark trap. The reactor contents were heated to about 85ยฐ C. to 95ยฐ C. for approximately 26 h while removing water using the Dean-Stark trap. The reaction to form the enamine (i.e., 4-cyclopentenylmorpholine, Compound of Formula (IIe) wherein R1 and R2 together with the nitrogen atom form a morpholine ring) is deemed complete when the morpholine amount is verified to be โฆ3% by GC peak area. The reactor contents were cooled to about 60ยฐ C. and ethyl glyoxalate (Compound of Formula (IIf) wherein R3 is ethyl; 58.74 kg, 50% solution in toluene) was added to the mixture slowly so as to maintain an internal temperature of โฆ80ยฐ C. The reactor contents were heated to about 85ยฐ C. to 95ยฐ C. for at least 25 hours while removing water using the Dean-Stark trap. The reaction was deemed complete when the eneamine (i.e., 4-cyclopentenylmorpholine) amount by GC was verified to be less than 0.5% by GC peak area. The cyclohexane/toluene mixture was distilled under vacuum, ethanol.(261.80 kg) was charged to the reactor, and the resulting solution was again distilled under vacuum. Ethanol (34.76 kg) and water 44.00 kg) were charged to the reactor and the reactor contents stirred at 25ยฐ C. The mixture was stirred further for 6 h at about 0-5ยฐ C. The resulting product slurry was collected by filtration, washed with aqueous ethanol (34.76 kg ethanol dissolved in 176.00 kg water). The filter-cake was further washed with water (110.00 kg), dried initially at approximately 36ยฐ C. for 1 hour under vacuum and subsequently at approximately 50ยฐ C. under vacuum for 17 h. The title compound was obtained as a tan solid (23.48 kg, 37.8% yield). Step D: Preparation of E/Z Ethyl 2-(7-(Benzyloxy)-1,2-dihydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3(4H)-ylidene)acetate To a 400 L glass-lined reactor equipped with overhead agitation, jacket temperature control, and a nitrogen inlet was added (4-(benzyloxy)phenyl)hydrazine hydrochloride (21.08 kg, 1.000 mole equiv.), ethyl 2-(2-morpholinocyclopent-2-enylidene)acetate (22.02 kg, 1.104 mole equiv.), ethanol (51.2 kg, 2.429 mass equiv.), and acetic acid (36.8 kg, 1.746 mass eq.). After the reactor contents are allowed to stand for 10 minutes, agitation and then heating to 60ยฐ C. to 65ยฐ C. (60ยฐ C. target) was started. While stirring at that temperature, samples of the reaction mixture were taken over intervals of approximately 30 minutes and analyzed by HPLC for (4-(benzyloxy)phenyl)hydrazine, ethyl 2-(2-morpholinocyclopent-2-enylidene)acetate, and hydrazone content. When (4-(benzyloxy)phenyl)hydrazine HPLC % area was <1, TFA (11.6 kg, 101.7 mol, 1.200 mole equiv., 0.550 mass equiv.) was charged over approximately 1 hour while the stirred reaction mixture was maintained at 60ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. with reactor jacket cooling. As stirring at 60ยฐ C. to 65ยฐ C. was continued, the hydrazone and imine content of the reaction mixture was monitored by HPLC. After stirring at 60ยฐ C. to 65ยฐ C. for at least 12 hours the imine content of the reaction mixture was <5% area by HPLC, and the stirred reaction mixture was cooled to 20ยฐ C. to 25ยฐ C. over approximately 3 hours. Stirring was maintained at that temperature to allow isomerization of the Z isomer to the desired E isomer. The E isomer crystallizes from the reaction mixture. The Z isomer and E isomer % area content of the reaction mixture was monitored by HPLC during this period of stirring at 20ยฐ C. to 25ยฐ C., which was continued until the Z-isomer content of the reaction mixture was <15% area by HPLC. The stirred reaction mixture was cooled (0ยฐ C. to 5ยฐ C.) over at least 2 hours and then filtered. The reactor was charged with ethanol (27.4 kg, 1.300 mass equiv.), which was stirred and chilled to 0ยฐ C. to 5ยฐ C. and then used in two approximately equal portions to slurry-wash the product filter cake twice. The reactor was charged with ethanol (13.8 kg, 0.655 mass equiv.), which was stirred and chilled to 0ยฐ C. to 5ยฐ C. and then used to wash the product filter cake by displacement. The reactor was charged with USP purified water (100 kg, 4.744 mass equiv.), and the temperature was adjusted to 20ยฐ C. to 25ยฐ C. The USP purified water was then used in three approximately equal portions to wash the product filter cake three times, the first two by reslurrying and the third by displacement. The reactor was charged with ethanol (16.4 kg, 0.778 mass equiv.), stirred and chilled to 0ยฐ C. to 5ยฐ C., and then used to wash the product filter cake by displacement. The washed product filter cake was dried under full vacuum first with a jacket temperature of 35ยฐ C. for 1 hour and then with a jacket temperature of 50ยฐ C. While drying continues with a jacket temperature of 50ยฐ C., the product solids are turned over every 1 hour to 3 hours, and product samples are analyzed for loss on drying (LOD) every โง4 hours. When LOD was <1%, the product was cooled to <30ยฐ C. The yield of the title compound was 13.06 kg (37.59 mol, 44.7%). Step E: Preparation of Ethyl 2-(7-Hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetate To a 200 liter Hastelloy reactor was added ethyl 2-(7-(benzyloxy)-1,2-dihydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3(4H)-ylidene)acetate (E/Z mixture, 12 kg), 10% Pd/C (50% wet with H2O; 1.80 kg) and ethyl acetate (108 kg). The suspension was degassed 3ร with N2 and triethylamine (1.76 kg) was added. To the resulting mixture was added formic acid (3.34 kg) while maintaining the internal temperature at below 35ยฐ C. The reaction progression was followed by HPLC to monitor the complete consumption of starting material (i.e., E/Z mixture of ethyl 2-(7-(benzyloxy)-1,2-dihydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3(4H)-ylidene)acetate) and the debenzylated intermediate. After approximately 30 minutes an additional amount of formic acid (0.50 kg) was added and the combined peak area of ethyl 2-(7-(benzyloxy)-1,2-dihydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3(4H)-ylidene)acetate and the related debenzylated intermediate was determined to be <1% area by HPLC. The reactor contents were filtered through a 1.2 ฮผm cartridge filter followed by an m-line 0.2 ฮผm inline polishing filter. To the filtrate was added water (60 kg) and the biphasic mixture was partitioned. The organics were separated and concentrated under vacuum at approximately 60ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. to a minimum stir volume, ethyl acetate (21.6 kg) was added and the mixture was further concentrated under vacuum to a minimum stir volume. Once again ethyl acetate (16.8 kg) was charged to the crude mixture and the resulting solution was heated to approximately 60ยฐ C. Heptanes (37.2 kg) were charged maintaining the internal temperature at 60ยฐ C. The solution was slowly cooled to approximately 0 to 5ยฐ C. and approximately 2-3 hr to facilitate crystallization. The slurry was filtered, the filter cake was reslurried in heptanes (27.12 kg) and ethyl acetate (7.08 kg). The resulting suspension was filtered and the solids dried under vacuum at approximately 40ยฑ5ยฐ C. (until the loss on drying (LOD) is <1%) to afford the title compound (6.23 kg, 70.3% yield) as a solid. Step F: Preparation of (R/S)-Ethyl 2-(7-(4-Cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetate (Compound of Formula (IIk), Wherein R3 is Ethyl) To a 50 liter glass reactor containing ethyl 2-(7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetate (2.000 kg, 1.000 equiv.) was added cesium carbonate (3.266 kg, 1.300 equiv.) and acetonitrile (15.720 kg) under nitrogen. To the resulting mixture was added 4-(chloromethyl)-1-cyclopentyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene (2.228 kg, 1.100 equiv.) over approximately one hour while maintaining the stirred reactor contents at 40ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. After the addition of 4-(chloromethyl)-1-cyclopentyl-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzene the reactor contents were heated to 65ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. with stirring until the concentration of ethyl 2-(7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetate in the reaction mixture was less than 2.0% area by HPLC. The reaction mixture was cooled to 50ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. and filtered under nitrogen through a fine filter cloth with suction to remove cesium salts (Note: ethyl 2-(7-(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetate may precipitate below 30ยฐ C.). The filter cake was washed with fresh hot (50ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C.) acetonitrile (5.658 kg divided in approximately three equal portions). The filtrates were returned to the reactor. The combined filtrates were concentrated by vacuum distillation with a jacket temperature of 60ยฐ C.ยฑ10ยฐ C. To the reactor was added ethyl alcohol (3.156 kg) and once again concentrated with stirring by vacuum distillation with a jacket temperature of 60ยฐ C.ยฑ10ยฐ C. Once again, ethyl alcohol (3.156 kg) was added to the reactor and the contents were concentrated by vacuum distillation with a jacket temperature of 60ยฐ C.ยฑ10ยฐ C. to a reactor volume of approximately 14 L. The stirred reactor contents were cooled to 0ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. and the temperature maintained for 4 hours to facilitate the crystallization of the product. The resulting slurry was filtered. The filter cake was washed with cold 0ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. ethyl alcohol (2ร3.156 kg). The filter cake was dried under vacuum at 35ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. until the weight loss over โง1 hour was โฆ2% to provide 3.0943 kg (81.0% yield) of the title compound as a solid. Step G: Preparation of (R)-2-(7-(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetic acid A 1.0M buffer solution was prepared containing potassium phosphate monobasic (29.1 g, 0.0335 equiv.) in USP purified water (213 g) and potassium phosphate dibasic (368.2 g, 0.331 equiv.) in USP purified water (2.107 g). To a 50 liter glass reactor was added ethyl 2-(7-(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetate (3.094 kg, 1.000 equiv.), Lipase B, Candida antarctica, immobilized (88.18 g, 293250 units/kg of ethyl ester starting material) and acetonitrile (22.32 kg). To the stirred contents of the reactor was added the previously prepared 1.0M potassium phosphate buffer. The resulting mixture was stirred under nitrogen at a temperature of 40ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. until the (R)-2-(7-(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetic acid concentration was โง35% area as determined by HPLC (Note: although the reaction usually is complete after about 10 hours, the reaction mixture may be held at 40ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. overnight). The stirred reactor contents were cooled to 25ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. and the pH was adjusted to between 4 and 5 by addition of a solution of citric acid (278.5 g, 0.228 equiv.) dissolved in USP purified water (1.454 kg). The reactor contents were filtered to remove immobilized lipase and phosphate and citrate salts. The reactor and solids were washed with acetonitrile (4.827 kg) and the combined filtrates were added backed into the reactor. The stirred reactor contents were concentrated to a volume of 1.0 L to 2.0 L by vacuum distillation at a jacket temperature of 55ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. To the reactor was added ethyl acetate (5.582 kg) and USP purified water (6.188 kg). The contents were stirred at 20ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. for at least 10 minutes and a solution of sodium chloride (1 kg) in USP purified water (1 kg) was added to facilitate phase separation. After phase separation was complete, the lower aqueous layer was drained. A solution of sodium chloride (5.569 kg) in USP purified water (12.38 kg) was divided in two approximately equal portions and the ethyl acetate phase was washed (2ร). The ethyl acetate phase was transferred into a carboy and the reactor was rinsed with ethyl acetate (838.5 g) and added to the carboy containing the ethyl acetate phase. The reactor was washed sequentially with USP purified water (12.38 kg), acetone (4.907 kg), and ethyl acetate (838.5 g) and the ethyl acetate mixture from the carboy was transferred back to the reactor and concentrated with stirring to a volume of 1 L to 2 L by vacuum distillation at a jacket temperature of 55ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. To the reactor was added 2-propanol (14.67 kg) and after stirring the resulting mixture was concentrated to a volume of 1 L to 2 L by vacuum distillation at a jacket temperature of 55ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. To the reactor was added 2-propanol (7.333 kg) and heated with stirring at 60ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. until the contents dissolved. The stirred reactor contents were cooled to 20ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. and filtered through a medium-porosity fritted-glass filter to remove any inorganic solids to provide a 2-propanol solution containing 1.3188 kg of the title compound. Step H: Preparation of L-Arginine Salt of (R)-2-(7-(4-Cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetic acid (Compound of Formula (Ia)) To a 50 liter glass reactor containing the 2-propanol solution prepared in Step G of (R)-2-(7-(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetic acid (1.3188 kg, 1.000 equiv.) was added an additional amount of 2-propanol (6.3389 kg) to adjust the total volume to approximately 16.7 L/kg of (R)-2-(7-(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetic acid. The reactor contents were stirred and heated to 60ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. To the reactor was added seed material (L-arginine salt of (R)-2-(7-(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetic acid, 26.4 g, 0.0145 equiv.). The reactor contents were stirred for approximately 5 minutes at 60ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. and a solution of L-arginine (502.5 g, 1.000 equiv.) in USP purified water (1.27 kg) preheated to 60ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C. was added over approximately 1 hour while maintaining the stirred reactor contents at 60ยฐ C.ยฑ5ยฐ C.

Animals: Female C57BL/6 mice (8 to 10 weeks of age at start of study) (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me.) were housed four per cage and maintained in a humidity-controlled (40-60%) and temperature-controlled (68-72ยฐ F.) facility on a 12 h: 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 6:30 am) with free access to food (Harlan Teklad, Orange, Calif., Rodent Diet 8604) and water. Mice were allowed one week of habituation to the animal facility before testing. Induction of EAE: Mice were immunized subcutaneously, 50 ฮผL per hind flank, with a total of 100 ฮผg MOG35-55 peptide emulsified 1:1 with Complete Freund's adjuvant containing 4 mg/mL heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mice also received 200 ng pertussis toxin intraperitoneally on the day of immunization and 48 h later. Clinical scoring: Severity of disease symptoms was scored as follows (in increasing order of severity): 0=normal; 1=limp tail OR hind limb weakness; 2=limp tail AND limb weakness/weakness of 2 or more limbs; 3-severe limb weakness or single limb paralysis; 4=paralysis of 2 or more limbs; 5=death. Drug treatment: Mice were dosed orally, with vehicle or (R)-2-(7-(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetic acid, once a day from day 3 until day 21.

Example 13 Effects of Compounds on Cardiac Telemetry in the Rat Animals: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g at time of surgery) were implanted by Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, Mass.) with cardiac transmitting devices (Data Sciences PhysioTel C50-PXT) into the peritoneal space, with a pressure-sensing catheter inserted into the descending aorta. Rats are allowed at least one week to recover. Rats were housed in individual cages and maintained in a humidity-controlled (30-70%) and temperature-controlled (20-22ยฐ C.) facility on a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 am) with free access to food (Harlan-Teklad, Orange, Calif., Rodent Diet 8604) and water. Rats were allowed one week of habituation to the animal facility before testing. Measurement of cardiovascular parameters: The implanted transmitting devices transmitted continuous measurements of blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, mean arterial, pulse), heart rate, body temperature, and motor activity in freely moving conscious animals. These data were transmitted via radiofrequency to a computer which binned the data into P min averages using DataSciences ART software. Telemetry recording occurred over a 21-h period, starting at noon and continuing until 9:00 am the following day. A maximum of eight rats were tested at a time, and the same eight rats were utilized for all treatment groups in a within-subject design. Drug treatment: Rats were injected orally with vehicle (PEG400) and (R)-2-(7-(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetic acid at 1:00 pm. A full study (vehicle+3 doses) required four separate testing sessions, which occur on Mondays-Tuesdays and Thursdays-Fridays. During each of the testing sessions, the eight rats were divided into four treatment groups such that each group comprised N=2 for any given session: Rats were re-tested in subsequent testing sessions in a crossover design such that by the end of the four sessions, all animals had received all treatments in a pseudo-random order, and each group comprised N=8. Exemplary bradycardia assay: It was expressly contemplated that the rats could be used to show that a compound of the invention had no or substantially no activity for bradycardia. By way of illustration and not limitation, the rats were administered vehicle (PEG 400) and (R)-2-(7-(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetic acid and heart rate was then measured over a 120 min period. Results are presented in FIG. 5. It is apparent from inspection of FIG. 5 that no or substantially no reduction of heart rate was exhibited in response to the treatment of rats with (R)-2-(7-(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetic acid in comparison with vehicle. No or substantially no reduction of heart rate was indicative for (R)-2-(7-(4-cyclopentyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzyloxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocyclopenta[b]indol-3-yl)acetic acid, thus exhibiting no or substantially no activity for bradycardia.

CHO-K1 cells were obtained from ATCCยฎ (Manassas, Va.; Catalog #CCL-61). The compound was determined to be an agonist of the S1P1 receptor and was detected in the HTRFยฎ assay for direct cAMP measurement as a compound which decreased cAMP concentration. The HTRFยฎ assay has been used to determine EC50 values for S1P1 receptor agonists. Principle of the assay: HTRFยฎ assay kit was purchased from Cisbio-US, Inc. (Bedford, Mass.; Catalog #62AM4PEC). The HTRFยฎ assay supported by the kit is a competitive immunoassay between endogenous cAMP produced by the CHO-K1 cells and tracer cAMP labeled with the dye d2. The tracer binding is visualized by a monoclonal anti-cAMP antibody labeled with Cryptate.

Standard curve: The fluorescence ratio (665 nm/620 nm) of the standards (0.17 to 712 nM cAMP) included in the assay was calculated and used to generate a cAMP standard curve according to the kit manufacturer's instructions. The fluorescence ratio of the samples (test compound or compound buffer) was calculated and used to deduce respective cAMP concentrations by reference to the cAMP standard curve. Setup of the assay: The HTRFยฎ assay was carried out using a two-step protocol essentially according to the kit manufacturer's instructions, in 20 ฮผL total volume per well in 384-well plate format (ProxiPlates; PerkinElmer, Fremont, Calif.; catalog #6008280).

The plate was then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. To each well was then added 5 ฮผL cAMP-d2 conjugate in lysis buffer and 5 ฮผL Cryptate conjugate in lysis buffer according to the kit manufacturer's instructions. The plate was then further incubated at room temperature for 1 hour, after which the assay plate was read. Assay readout: HTRFยฎ readout was accomplished using a PHERAstar (BMG LABTECH Inc., Durham, N.C.) or EnVisionโข (PerkinElmer, Fremont Calif.) microplate reader.
