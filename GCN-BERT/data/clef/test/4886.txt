STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT This invention was made with government support under grant number K99/R00CA131503 awarded by the National Cancer Institute. The government has certain rights in the invention. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Throughout this application various publications are referred to.

The disclosures of these publications, and of all patents, patent application publications and books referred to herein, are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety into the subject application to more fully describe the art to which the subject invention pertains. Transcription factors are critical for the regulation of normal hematopoiesis as well as leukemogenesis. Several members of the Hox (Class I homeobox genes) family of transcription factors, which contain a conserved homeobox domain and are organized into 4 major gene clusters in humans, have been implicated in the functioning of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells as well as for leukemic transformation and the generation of leukemia-initiating cells. Much less is known about the role of non-clustered (class II) homeobox genes in hematopoiesis and leukemia. The transcriptional analysis of purified stem and progenitor populations has recently been utilized as a powerful tool to identify critical regulators of stem and progenitor cell function and transformation to leukemia-initiating cells. Analyzing hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) in a murine model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), this laboratory found the non-clustered H2.0-like homeobox (Hlx) gene to be 4-fold upregulated compared to wildtype HSPC (Steidl, 2006). Hlx is the highly conserved human/murine homologue of the homeobox gene H2.0, which was found to show tissue-specific expression throughout development in Drosophila melanogaster. Additional studies two decades ago detected Hlx expression in hematopoietic progenitors and in leukemic blasts of patients with AML, and a study of Hlx-deficient fetal liver cells suggested a decrease of colony-formation capacity. However, the function, if any, of Hlx in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and its role, if any, in leukemia have not been studied. The present invention addresses the need for novel anti-leukemia treatments and novel myelodysplastic syndrome treatments by providing, inter alia, treatments based on inhibition of HLX expression or of HLX expression products.

Patients with high expression of HLX show inferior clinical outcome in each individual dataset. (15A) GSE12417(U133A). (15B) GSE12417(U133plus2.0). (15C) GSE10358. (15D) GSE14468. P values (log-rank test) are indicated. (15E) Kaplan-Meier plot of overall survival (irrespective of HLX status) in datasets GSE12417 (U133plus2.0), GSE14468 and GSE10358. The graph shows superimposable survival curves (p=0.4636, log-rank test), indicating very similar overall survival in each of these three datasets. (15F) Kaplan-Meier plot of overall survival (irrespective of HLX status) of the combined patients from datasets GSE12417(U133plus2.0) and GSE14468 and GSE10358, in comparison to patients from dataset GSE12417(U133A).

Kaplan-Meier plots comparing overall survival of AML patients with low versus high overall score of the Hlx core signature (“Hlx core signature LOW” (black line) and “Hlx core signature HIGH” (gray line)). Patients with an Hlx core signature score above the median (“Hlx core signature HIGH”) have a significantly inferior overall survival (p<0.0001). FIG. 17. Replating data showing “immortalization” of myeloid progenitors and unlimited clonogenicity with Hlx expression. FIG. 18. Inhibitory effect of HLX in several human AML cell lines. FIG. 19A-19B. 19A: This figure shows data indicating that Btg1 and Pak1 are functionally critical downstream genes of Hlx and, (19B) mediate the anti-leukemic effect of Hlx inhibition. As such, Btg1 and Pak1 are therapeutic targets. FIG. 20A-20B. 20A: HLX regulates an entire signature of gene expression (17 genes), and this is signature is strongly prognostic in terms of overall survival (as is Hlx expression itself). 20B: The lower panel shows the signature being tested and validated in an additional independent patient cohorts. FIG. 21. PAK1 expression levels are of prognostic relevance in AML, but only in combination with high HLX levels, indicating functional cooperativity. FIG. 22. PAK1 levels are correlated with HLX expression in AML patients, and overexpression of Hlx leads to increased Pak1 levels in myeloid stem and progenitor cells. FIG. 23. HLX is specifically elevated in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in a subset of patients classified as RAEB-2 (refractory anemia with excess of blasts 2). This subgroup has the most aggressive type of disease and is most likely to progress to overt AML. HLX elevation can be used to identify patients who are most likely to progress to AML and thus require treatment and can be a therapeutic target in MDS patients in general, too.

In an embodiment, the siRNA comprises a double-stranded portion (duplex). In an embodiment, the siRNA is 20-25 nucleotides in length. In an embodiment the siRNA comprises a 19-21 core RNA duplex with a one or 2 nucleotide 3′ overhang on, independently, either one or both strands. In an embodiment, the overhang is UU. The siRNA can be 5′ phosphorylated or not and may be modified with any of the known modifications in the art to improve efficacy and/or resistance to nuclease degradation. In a non-limiting embodiment, the siRNA can be administered such that it is transfected into one or more cells. In one embodiment, a siRNA of the invention comprises a double-stranded RNA comprising a first and second strand, wherein one strand of the RNA is 80, 85, 90, 95 or 100% complementary to a portion of an RNA transcript of a gene encoding Homo sapiens H2.0-like homeobox (HLX) (or of PAK1 or BTG1 as appropriate, mutatis mutandis). Thus, in an embodiment, the invention encompasses an siRNA comprising a 19, 20 or 21 nucleotide first RNA strand which is 80, 85, 90, 95 or 100% complementary to a 19, 20 or 21 nucleotide portion, respectively, of an RNA transcript of an HLX gene. In embodiment, the second RNA strand of the double-stranded RNA is also 19, 20 or 21 nucleotides, respectively, a 100% complementary to the first strand. In another embodiment, a siRNA of the invention comprises a double-stranded RNA wherein one strand of the RNA comprises a portion having a sequence the same as a portion of 18-25 consecutive nucleotides of an RNA transcript of a gene encoding Homo sapiens H2.0-like homeobox (HLX).

In another embodiment, an siRNA of the invention comprises at least one 2′-sugar modification. In another embodiment, an siRNA of the invention comprises at least one nucleic acid base modification. In another embodiment, an siRNA of the invention comprises at least one phosphate backbone modification. In one embodiment, RNAi inhibition of HLX is effected by an agent which is a short hairpin RNA (“shRNA”). The shRNA is introduced into the cell by transduction with a vector. In an embodiment, the vector is a lentiviral vector. In an embodiment, the vector comprises a promoter. In an embodiment, the promoter is a U6 or H1 promoter. In an embodiment the shRNA encoded by the vector is a first nucleotide sequence ranging from 19-29 nucleotides complementary to the target gene, in the present case HLX. In an embodiment the shRNA encoded by the vector also comprises a short spacer of 4-15 nucleotides (a loop, which does not hybridize) and a 19-29 nucleotide sequence that is a reverse complement of the first nucleotide sequence. In an embodiment the siRNA resulting from intracellular processing of the shRNA has overhangs of 1 or 2 nucleotides. In an embodiment the siRNA resulting from intracellular processing of the shRNA overhangs has two 3′ overhangs. In an embodiment the overhangs are UU. In one embodiment, inhibition of HLX is effected by an agent which is an antibody or by a fragment of an antibody. As used herein, the term “antibody” refers to complete, intact antibodies, “fragment of an antibody” refers to Fab, Fab′, F(ab)2, and other fragments thereof, or an ScFv, which bind the antigen of interest, in this case an HLX gene, or which bind Hlx. Complete, intact antibodies include, but are not limited to, monoclonal antibodies such as murine monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, chimeric antibodies, human antibodies, and humanized antibodies. Various forms of antibodies may be produced using standard recombinant DNA techniques (Winter and Milstein, Nature 349: 293-99, 1991). For example, “chimeric” antibodies may be constructed, in which the antigen binding domain from an animal antibody is linked to a human constant domain (an antibody derived initially from a nonhuman mammal in which recombinant DNA technology has been used to replace all or part of the hinge and constant regions of the heavy chain and/or the constant region of the light chain, with corresponding regions from a human immunoglobulin light chain or heavy chain) (see, e.g., Cabilly et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Morrison et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 81: 6851-55, 1984). Chimeric antibodies reduce the immunogenic responses elicited by animal antibodies when used in human clinical treatments. In addition, recombinant “humanized” antibodies may be synthesized. Humanized antibodies are antibodies initially derived from a nonhuman mammal in which recombinant DNA technology has been used to substitute some or all of the amino acids not required for antigen binding with amino acids from corresponding regions of a human immunoglobulin light or heavy chain. That is, they are chimeras comprising mostly human immunoglobulin sequences into which the regions responsible for specific antigen-binding have been inserted (see, e.g., PCT patent application WO 94/04679). Animals are immunized with the desired antigen, the corresponding antibodies are isolated and the portion of the variable region sequences responsible for specific antigen binding are removed. The animal-derived antigen binding regions are then cloned into the appropriate position of the human antibody genes in which the antigen binding regions have been deleted. Humanized antibodies minimize the use of heterologous (inter-species) sequences in antibodies for use in human therapies, and are less likely to elicit unwanted immune responses. Primatized antibodies can be produced similarly. Another embodiment of the antibodies employed in the compositions and methods of the invention is a human antibody directed against HLX, or a fragment of such antibody, which can be produced in nonhuman animals, such as transgenic animals harboring one or more human immunoglobulin transgenes. Such animals may be used as a source for splenocytes for producing hybridomas, for example as is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,569,825. Fragments of the antibodies described herein and univalent antibodies may also be used in the methods and compositions of this invention. Univalent antibodies comprise a heavy chain/light chain dimer bound to the Fc (or stem) region of a second heavy chain. “Fab region” refers to those portions of the chains which are roughly equivalent, or analogous, to the sequences which comprise the Y branch portions of the heavy chain and to the light chain in its entirety, and which collectively (in aggregates) have been shown to exhibit antibody activity. A Fab protein includes aggregates of one heavy and one light chain (commonly known as Fab′), as well as tetramers which correspond to the two branch segments of the antibody Y, (commonly known as F(ab)2), whether any of the above are covalently or non-covalently aggregated, so long as the aggregation is capable of specifically reacting with a particular antigen or antigen family. In an embodiment, the agents of the invention as described herein are administered in the form of a composition comprising the agent and a carrier. The term “carrier” is used in accordance with its art-understood meaning, to refer to a material that is included in a pharmaceutical composition but does not abrogate the biological activity of pharmaceutically active agent(s) that are also included within the composition. Typically, carriers have very low toxicity to the animal to which such compositions are to be administered. In some embodiments, carriers are inert. In one embodiment of the methods, the HLX expression level or activity level of the gene product thereof (or of PAK1 or BTG1 protein, mutatis mutandis) is detected using a detectable agent. As used herein, a “detectable agent” is any agent that binds to HLX gene or to Hlx and which can be detected or observed, when bound, by methods known in the art. In non-limiting examples, the detectable agent can be an antibody or a fragment of an antibody, which is itself detectable, e.g. by a secondary antibody, or which is labeled with a detectable marker such as a radioisotope, a fluorophore, a dye etc. permitting detection of the presence of the bound agent by the appropriate machine, or optionally in the case of visually detectable agents, with the human eye. In an embodiment, the amount of detectable agent can be quantified. As used herein, a “cancer” is a disease state characterized by the presence in a subject of cells demonstrating abnormal uncontrolled replication. In a preferred embodiment, the cancer is a leukemia. In a most preferred embodiment, the cancer is acute myeloid leukemia. As used herein, “treating” a cancer, or a grammatical equivalent thereof, means effecting a reduction of, amelioration of, or prevention of further development of one or more symptoms of the disease, or placing the cancer in a state of remission, or maintaining it in a state of remission. As used herein a “leukemia” is an art-recognized cancer of the blood or bone marrow characterized by an abnormal increase of immature white blood cells called “blasts”. The specific condition of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid line of blood cells, characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the bone marrow and interfere with the production of normal blood cells. The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS, formerly known as preleukemia) are a collection of hematological conditions that involve ineffective production (or dysplasia) of the myeloid class of blood cells. Patients with MDS often develop severe anemia and require frequent blood transfusions. In most cases, the disease worsens and the patient develops cytopenias (low blood counts) due to progressive bone marrow failure. In about one third of patients with MDS, the disease transforms into acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), usually within months to a few years. The myelodysplastic syndromes are all disorders of the stem cell in the bone marrow. RAEB II is indicated by the presence of 10-19% blasts, and has a poorer prognosis than RAEB I (5-9% blasts). In an embodiment, the stem cell obtained from the subject is obtained by obtaining a sample from the subject. As used herein, a “sample” of a cancer or of a tumor is a portion of the cancer or of the tumor, respectively, for example as obtained by a biopsy. In the case of a leukemia, or AML, the preferred sample is bone marrow, or is derived from bone marrow, or is blood or is derived from blood. In an embodiment, the sample is, or comprises, a stem cell. As used herein a “sample derived from blood” or a “sample derived from bone marrow” is a sample which has been treated chemically and/or mechanically, but in such a manner not to alter HLX expression levels or activity levels which might be contained therein. In an embodiment, the microarray comprises probes attached via surface engineering to a solid surface by a covalent bond to a chemical matrix (via, in non-limiting examples, epoxy-silane, amino-silane, lysine, polyacrylamide). Suitable solid surface can be, in non-limiting examples, glass or a silicon chip, a solid bead forms of, for example, polystyrene. As used herein, unless otherwise specified, a microarray includes both solid-phase microarrays and bead microarrays. In an embodiment, the microarray is a solid-phase microarray. In an embodiment, the microarray is a plurality of beads microarray. In an embodiment, the microarray is a spotted microarray. In an embodiment, the microarray is an oligonucleotide microarray. The nucleic acid probes (e.g. oligonucleotide probes) of the microarray may be of any convenient length necessary for unique discrimination (is specific for) of target gene transcripts. In non-limiting examples, the probes are 20 to 30 nucleotides in length, 31 to 40 nucleotides in length, 41 to 50 nucleotides in length, 51 to 60 nucleotides in length, 61 to 70 nucleotides in length, or 71 to 80 nucleotides in length. In an embodiment, the target sample (e.g. gene mRNA transcripts), or nucleic acids derived from the target sample, such as cDNA, are contacted with a detectable marker, such as one or more fluorophores, under conditions permitting the detectable marker to attach to the target sample or nucleic acids derived from the target sample. Such fluorophores are well known in the art, for example cyanine 3, cyanine 5. In an embodiment, the target hybridized to the probe can be detected by conductance, mass spectrometry (including MALDI-TOF), or electrophoresis. The microarray can be manufactured by any method known in the art including by photolithography, pipette, drop-touch, piezoelectric (ink-jet), and electric techniques. If desired, mRNA in the sample can be enriched with respect to other cellular RNAs, such as transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Most mRNAs contain a poly(A) tail at their 3′ end. This allows them to be enriched by affinity chromatography, for example, using oligo(dT) or poly(U) coupled to a solid support, such as cellulose or Sephadex™ (see Ausubel et al., CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, vol. 2, Current Protocols Publishing, New York (1994), hereby incorporated by reference). In a non-limiting example, once bound, poly(A)+mRNA is eluted from the affinity column using 2 mM EDTA/0.1% SDS. Methods for preparing total and poly(A)+RNA are well known and are described generally in Sambrook et al., MOLECULAR CLONING—A LABORATORY MANUAL (2ND ED.), Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989)) and Ausubel et al., CURRENT PROTOCOLS IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, vol. 2, Current Protocols Publishing, New York (1994)), the contents of both of which are incorporated herein. RNA may be isolated from samples of eukaryotic cells by procedures that involve lysis of the cells and denaturation of the proteins contained therein. Additional steps may be employed to remove DNA. Cell lysis may be accomplished with a nonionic detergent, followed by microcentrifugation to remove the nuclei and hence the bulk of the cellular DNA. In one embodiment, RNA is extracted from cells of the various types of interest using guanidinium thiocyanate lysis followed by CsCl centrifugation to separate the RNA from DNA (Chirgwin et al., Biochemistry 18:5294-5299 (1979) hereby incorporated by reference). Poly(A)+RNA can be selected by selection with oligo-dT cellulose (see Sambrook et al, MOLECULAR CLONING—A LABORATORY MANUAL (2ND ED.), Vols. 1-3, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989). Alternatively, separation of RNA from DNA can be accomplished by organic extraction, for example, with hot phenol or phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. If desired, RNase inhibitors may be added to the lysis buffer. Likewise, for certain cell types, it may be desirable to add a protein denaturation/digestion step to the protocol. As used herein “likely” in describing an occurrence means more likely than not. As used herein, “susceptible to” in describing a condition means more likely to develop the condition in a situation than a majority of the population from which the subject is drawn. As used herein a “predetermined level” with regard to a quantity is the level of the quantity determined from one or more suitable control(s). In an embodiment the suitable control is a subject who does not have the relevant cancer and/or is not susceptible to the relevant cancer, or is a tissue or cell of such a subject. In an embodiment, the cancer that the subject does not have and/or is not susceptible to is acute myeloid leukemia. All combinations of the various elements described herein are within the scope of the invention unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. This invention will be better understood from the Experimental Details, which follow. However, one skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the specific methods and results discussed are merely illustrative of the invention as described more fully in the claims that follow thereafter. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS It is disclosed herein that HLX is overexpressed in the majority of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) and is associated with poor clinical outcome. It is also disclosed herein that HLX increases clonogenicity and inhibits differentiation, and that the inhibition of HLX has an anti-leukemic effect. This study identifies Hlx as a novel class II homeobox gene which is critically involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia, and suggests that HLX is a prognostic and therapeutic target. Example 1 Hlx Overexpression Impairs Hematopoietic Reconstitution, Eliminates Functional Long-Term Hematopoietic Stem Cells, and Leads to Persistence of a Small Progenitor Population To examine the functional consequences of elevated Hlx levels on hematopoiesis, a lentiviral overexpression system was utilized (FIG. 1A+B). Lineage-negative (Lin−), c-Kit+ cells were sorted from the bone marrow of wildtype mice and transduced cells with either a lentivirus expressing GFP as a control or lentivirus expressing Hlx and GFP, and then transplanted cells into lethally irradiated congenic recipient mice. At the time of transplantation, transduction efficiency of control lentivirus and Hlx lentivirus was comparable, with both at approximately 50% (FIG. 6). Twenty-four hours post-transplantation, both control GFP-positive cells and Hlx-overexpressing GFP-positive Ly5.2 donor cells were detected in the bone marrow at similar frequencies (42.3% and 40.3%, respectively), indicating homing of the transplanted cells. Eight weeks and twelve weeks after transplantation, hematopoietic multilineage reconstitution was evaluated in the peripheral blood. Both groups engrafted robustly with an average donor chimerism of Ly5.2 cells of 80% (SD: 10%) and 85% (SD: 9%) in the control and Hlx group, respectively. However, while mice transplanted with control cells showed on average a percentage of 35% (SD: 17%) GFP-positive donor cells in the peripheral blood, mice transplanted with Hlx-transduced cells displayed drastically less GFP-positive donor cells (average: 0.07%, SD: 0.06%), demonstrating a severe defect of Hlx-overexpressing cells in hematopoietic reconstitution (FIG. 1C). To determine the cellular compartments in which Hlx was effective stem and progenitor cells in the recipient bone marrow (BM) were analyzed. Strikingly, in the mice transplanted with Hlx-expressing cells, GFP-positive long-term HSC (LT-HSC; Thy1loFLk2-LSK (Lin−Sca1+Kit+)) could not be detected, while an average of 42% (SD:20%) GFP-positive LT-HSC was found in the control mice (FIG. 1D). Furthermore, in contrast to control animals, GFP-positive Hlx-expressing short-term HSC (ST-HSCs; Thy1loFLk2+LSK), multipotent progenitors (MPP; Thy1−FLk2+LSK), common myeloid progenitors (CMP; Lin−kit+Sca−1−FcγRloCD341o), granulocyte/monocyte progenitors (GMP; Lin−kit+Sca−1−FcγRhiCD341o) and megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitors (MEP; Lin−kit+Sca−1−FcγR−CD34−) were not found, indicating that Hlx acts at the level of the earliest hematopoietic stem cells. (FIG. 7). Given the lack of LT-HSC as well as more committed progenitors, HLX-GFP-positive transduced KL cells were analyzed by AnnexinV/DAPI staining to determine if Hlx overexpression might act by induction of apoptosis or necrosis in the transplanted KL cells. Both the control as well as Hlx-overexpressing cells displayed the same low percentage of apoptotic/necrotic cells (FIG. 9), indicating that Hlx acts by a mechanism other than induction of apoptosis or necrosis. Consequently, total bone marrow of recipient animals was we searched for alternative donor-derived GFP-positive cell populations persisting upon Hlx overexpression. Strikingly, a small population of GFP-positive, CD45.2(Ly.5.2)-positive cells was detected, which were still present 12 weeks after transplantation and were lineage-negative, CD34-negative, and c-Kit-negative (FIG. 1E). To characterize this cell population further, a series of experiments testing their cell biological properties, including clonogenic and differentiation capacities were performed. Hlx Confers Increased Serial Clonogenicity to CD34−Kit− Hematopoietic Cells. To test the effect of Hlx overexpression on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, in vitro colony formation assays of transduced LSK cells were performed. Hlx-transduced LSK cells formed slightly fewer colonies than control-transduced LSK cells (FIG. 2A). Colonies derived from Hlx-transduced LSK cells were also smaller (FIG. 10). To evaluate long-term clonogenicity of Hlx-overexpressing cells, serial-replating assays were performed. Strikingly, Hlx overexpressing cells showed greater clonogenic capacity in the 2nd and 3rd plating in comparison to control-transduced cells, and maintained serial clonogenicity in the 4th and 5th plating (FIG. 2A). Colonies were not only more numerous than control but noticeably larger in size after five platings (FIG. 2B). Cell surface marker expression of cells was analyzed from the initial plating and it was noticed that Hlx overexpression led to a decrease of c-kit+ cells, similar to the in vivo phenotype, and an increased proportion of phenotypically more mature CD34−Kit− cells in comparison to control-transduced cells (FIG. 2C+D). To determine which cellular subpopulation(s) conferred the increased clonogenic capacity, equal numbers of CD34+kit+ cells, CD34+kit− cells, CD34−kit+ cells, and CD34−kit− cells were sorted from the first plating, and subjected each individual population to colony formation assays. Only CD34−Kit− cells derived from Hlx-overexpressing cells formed a larger number of colonies in comparison to control cells, while all other populations did not display significant clonogenicity (FIG. 2E). Furthermore, the Hlx-overexpressing GFP+CD34−Kit− cells showed serial replating capacity through 4 rounds, while all other populations exhausted significantly earlier (FIG. 2F). Finally, when the serially-replating, Hlx-overexpressing GFP+CD34−kit− cells were injected after the fourth plating into irradiated NOD-SCID-IL2Rgamma null (NSG) mice, GFP-positive cells could still be detected after 7 weeks in the peripheral blood (FIG. 11). These data indicate that increased levels of Hlx confer long-term clonogenicity to a population of CD34−kit− cells. Hlx Induces a Partial Myelo-Monocytic Differentiation Block To investigate the effect of Hlx overexpression with regards to differentiation capacity, the clonogenic GFP+CD34−Kit− cells from the primary colonies were analyzed for the expression of additional cell surface markers. Strikingly, the proportions of Gr1+Mac1+ and Gr1−Mac1+, as well as F4/80+Mac1+ expressing cells were significantly reduced, indicative of a defect in myelo-monocytic differentiation (FIG. 3A). At the same time, expression of erythroid, B-lymphoid, or T-lymphoid markers was unchanged (FIG. 3A). Interestingly, almost half of the Hlx-overexpressing GFP+CD34−kit− population was lineage (Gr−1, Ter119, F4/80, CD19, B220, CD3)-negative, whereas only 16% of GFP+CD34−Kit− cells from control-transduced cells were lineage-negative (FIG. 3A). When Hlx-overexpressing GFP+Lin−CD34−kit− cells were sorted and tested in colony formation assays, they also showed a significant increase in clonogenicity (FIG. 12), indicating that Hlx acts at the level of Lin−CD34−kit− cells. To specifically test myelo-monocytic differentiation, colony-formation assays were conducted with GM-CSF or M-CSF stimulation, respectively. Hlx-transduced cells gave rise to significantly lower numbers of Gr1−Mac1+ and F4/80+Mac1+ cells compared to control-transduced cells, upon either GM-CSF or M-CSF stimulation (FIG. 3B, D). Cytomorphological evaluation of cells after stimulation showed an increased percentage of Hlx-transduced cells with immature progenitor morphology, in stark contrast to control-transduced cells which predominantly displayed mature monocytic morphology (FIG. 3C, E). Taken together, these findings show that Hlx not only enhances clonogenicity of an increased population of Lin−CD34−Kit− cells, but also confers a partial myelo-monocytic differentiation block. Hlx Downregulation Inhibits Acute Myeloid Leukemia To test the hypothesis presented herein that Hlx overexpression is functionally important for acute myeloid leukemia cells a series of inhibition experiments were carried out utilizing RNA interference targeting Hlx. Leukemia cells derived from the PU.1 UREΔ/Δ AML model (URE cells; which express high levels of Hlx) were transduced with lentiviral constructs expressing either an Hlx-directed (sh Hlx) or a control shRNA (sh control). Strikingly, knockdown of Hlx by 80% led to significantly reduced formation of colonies of leukemic cells in methylcellulose assays in comparison to control-treated cells (median: 208 [SD; 30] colonies in sh control versus 85 [SD; 19] colonies in sh Hlx; p<0.00001) formation of leukemic colonies in methylcellulose assays in comparison to control-treated cells (FIG. 4A, B). Likewise, reduction of Hlx levels significantly reduced cell proliferation in suspension culture, as determined by MTS assays and manual cell counts (FIG. 4C, D). Examining the differentiation of the cells by cell surface markers, it was found that reduction of Hlx leads to an increased population of cells expressing lower levels of c-Kit and higher levels of Mac1, indicative of myeloid differentiation (FIG. 4E, F). Stimulation with GM-CSF further increased the number of Mac1 and Gr−1 expressing cells and cytomorphologically led to partial differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia cells in sh Hlx treated cells in comparison to control-treated cells, which retained an immature, leukemic morphology (FIG. 4G). Viability staining with Annexin V/DAPI indicated that Hlx downregulation in URE cells led to a statistically significant decrease in viable cells, and an increase in necrotic cells (FIG. 4H). This was also accompanied by a lower number of cells in S phase, and a higher number of cells in G1 phase of cell cycle (FIG. 4I). To test the anti-leukemic effect of Hlx downregulation in vivo, murine transplantation assays of cells transduced with either Hlx-directed or control shRNAs were performed. Strikingly, it was found that reduction of Hlx levels in transplanted URE cells prolonged recipient animal survival in comparison to mice transplanted with control shRNA-transduced cells (p=0.0012) (FIG. 4J). Taken together, the findings demonstrate that targeting Hlx can rescue the myeloid differentiation block in acute myeloid leukemia, inhibit growth and decrease clonogenicity, and lead to improved survival in a murine transplantation model. To gain insight into the molecular effects caused by Hlx inhibition gene expression profiles of shHlx-transduced URE cells and control shRNA-transduced cells were measured. Leukemia cells treated with Hlx-directed shRNAs displayed markedly different gene expression patterns with 392 genes being significantly differentially expressed (FIG. 4K). Gene set enrichment analysis showed that “cell lineage commitment”, “cell differentiation”, “cell activation”, and “cell proliferation” were among the most significantly affected cellular functions (FIG. 4L). These gene expression changes are highly consistent with the leukemia-inhibitory effect of Hlx reduction in URE cells. Several key genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle and proliferation, cell death, and myeloid differentiation, were significantly changed upon Hlx downregulation (FIG. 4M). Differential expression of several genes, namely Btg1, FoxO4, Gadd45a, Tp63, Hdac7, Pak1, and Satb1 was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (FIG. 13). Enrichment of genes involved in pathways of other cellular functions was also found including leukocyte migration, plasma membrane composition, and inflammatory response (FIG. 14). Further, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) software was utilized to compare the Hlx knockdown data with the molecular signatures database (MSigDB) [Ref. Subramanian, Tamayo, et al. (2005, PNAS 102, 15545-15550) and Mootha, Lindgren, et al. (2003, Nat Genet 34, 267-273)]. Significant negative enrichment of several known leukemia- and stem cell-related gene signatures was found in a gene set enrichment analysis of gene signatures from experimental models with altered Hlx expression. The data showed correlation of Hlx levels with several leukemia and stem cell gene signatures. Hlx knock-down in URE cell line and Hlx overexpression in sorted murine c−kit+ Sca−1+ lineage− (CD4− CD8− Ter119− B220− CD19− Gr1−) cells was investigated. Enrichment and normalized enrichment scores were determined Taken together, these data are consistent with a model that Hlx overexpression leads to activation of a specific transcriptional program in leukemia cells which affects processes critical for leukemogenesis such as cell differentiation and proliferation, and which can at least partially be reversed by inhibition of Hlx for therapeutic purposes. HLX is Overexpressed in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia To examine whether HLX overexpression plays a role in human leukemia, gene expression data of 344[U1] patients with acute myeloid leukemia (Figueroa et al., Cancer Cell, January 2010) was analyzed. Strikingly, HLX was overexpressed in the majority of patients with AML in comparison to CD34+ cells of healthy donors (FIG. 5A). Overall, the average of HLX expression was 2.03-fold higher in AML patients (FIG. 5B), and this was statistically highly significant (p=1.9×10-9). 54% (185 out 344) of patients with AML overexpressed HLX more than 2-fold, and 25% of patients displayed higher than 2.73-fold overexpression with the range extending up 6.8-fold overexpression. These results demonstrate that HLX overexpression is a common feature in patients with AML. Increased HLX Expression Correlates with Inferior Survival Whether HLX expression levels in patients were associated with any known clinical or molecular parameters was examined. For that purpose 4 published datasets of patients with AML, of whom gene expression and time-to-event data were available (GSE10358, GSE12417 (U113A), GSE12417 (U133plus2), GSE14468), were analyzed. As the lower 25% of patients had HLX expression levels very similar to CD34+ cells of healthy donors (FIG. 5B), the 25th percentile was used to dichotomize patients into “HLX high” and “HLX low” expressers. The overall survival of AML patients was compared with low versus high HLX, and it was observed that in each of the 4 different data sets, high levels of HLX expression were associated with inferior overall survival (FIG. 15A-D). Overall survival (irrespective of HLX status) in datasets GSE12417 (U133plus2.0), GSE14468 and GSE10358 was very similar, with superimposable survival curves (p=0.4636, log-rank test; FIG. 15E, 15F), suggesting that the patient populations in these datasets and their clinical outcomes were comparable and could be combined for further analyses. Consistent with the analyses of the individual datasets, the evaluation of the combined set of patients from the GSE10358, GSE12417 (U133plus2.0) and GSE14468 datasets (N=601 total) confirmed that high HLX levels are associated with inferior overall survival (p=2.336×10-6 (log-rank); hazard ratio (HR)=0.57 (95% confidence interval: 0.046-0.71); median survival: 17.05 months for HLX high, not reached for HLX low; 5-yr survival rate: 32.95% for HLX high, 55.85% for HLX low) (FIG. 5C). To assess whether the impact of HLX expression on overall survival is independent of known prognostic factors for AML, multivariate analysis was performed based on the data of the initial 344[U2] patients (Figueroa et al. Cancer Cell, January 2010), using a Cox regression model. In this analysis, high HLX status remained an independent prognostic factor (p=0.0416, HR 1.521) along with FLT3 mutation status (p=0.0003, HR 1.925), NPM1 mutation status (p=0.0006, HR 0.518), CEBPA mutation status (p=0.0371, HR 0.693), and cytogenetic risk group (p=0.0109, HR 1.382). The independent prognostic role of HLX status indicated that it may provide additional prognostic information for patients who belong to previously established, but prognostically heterogeneous, molecularly defined subtypes of AML. Indeed, it was observed that among patients in certain molecularly defined subtypes which are considered prognostically favorable, namely FLT3 wild-type status, NPM1 mutation, or CEBPα mutation, high HLX expression is associated with inferior overall survival (p=0.0175, p=0.0407 and p=0.0306, respectively) (FIG. 5B-D). To gain insight into the molecular consequences of elevated Hlx levels, Hlx was overexpressed in sorted LSK cells and genome-wide transcriptional analysis was performed. It was found that 195 genes were significantly changed, resulting in a clearly distinguishable expression signature induced by Hlx overexpression. Data were analyzed as hierarchical clustering of genes differentially expressed upon Hlx overexpression in sorted LSK cells. Genes with −log 10 (p) value <0.1 and a group mean difference >0.5 (log 2 scale) were considered differentially expressed. After filtering out unannotated and duplicate genes, genes were clustered by hierarchical, Euclidean distance, complete linkage clustering. Using GSEA enrichment of known leukemia- and stem cell-related gene signatures was found, which is consistent with this laboratory's findings. Next, human “Hlx high” signatures were generated from each of the 3 gene expression data sets of patients with AML. Genes differentially expressed in patients with low versus high HLX were identified (lower bound of fold-change<1.0, p<0.05, FDR<10%[U3]) and a common signature across different AML datasets was generated by cross-comparison of individual signatures. This “Hlx high” signature in human AML was then overlaid with the signature obtained from the Hlx overexpression experiment. The resultant consensus “Hlx core signature” comprised a total of 25 genes, each of which were commonly changed in all AML data sets and upon Hlx overexpression in LSK cells (Table 1). To test if the Hlx core signature was clinically relevant, patients were dichotomized based on their overall score into “Hlx core signature LOW” and “Hlx core signature HIGH”. When the overall survival of AML patients was compared, it was observed that patients of the “Hlx core signature HIGH” group showed strikingly inferior overall survival (FIG. 16) (p<0.0001 (log-rank), HR=XX), with a median survival of 15.5 months (versus “not reached”, in HLX core signature LOW patients), 5 year overall survival of 23% (versus 53%).

This list of genes was subsequently intersected with the human orthologs of the genes that were differentially expressed in the mouse overexpression or knockdown models, and which showed the same directionality of expression differences relative to Hlx levels between data from the Hlx knockdown or overexpression experiments with murine cells and human data. This list of 45 genes was subsequently used as covariates for Hlx expression and for overall survival in the R/Bioconductor globaltest function (Goeman, van de Geer, et al, 2004), and the most significantly correlated genes (17) were selected to define an Hlx-associated signature (“Hlx signature”). [C4] To calculate a signature score, expression of each gene was median-centered to give equal weight to each component of the signature, and the mean of the positively associated minus the mean of the negatively associated genes was calculated for each patient sample. The samples from GSE14468 (test set) and GSE10358 (validation set) were then ranked and dichotomized according to this normalized signature score.[C5] A score can be calculated and preferably the directionality is factored in. The negatively associated genes should be factored in with a “minus”, so that they further enhance the score. In an embodiment of the methods described herein, the subject is assessed by determining the signature score and confirming if the signature score is above a predetermined signature score (e.g. from a control). The individual genes included in the HLX signature are as follows (3 negatively associated; 14 positively associated): ZNF451 (negative) AIG1 (negative) GALC (negative) PGD (positive) RASGRP4 (positive) ITGAM (positive) PAK1 (positive) CD53 (positive) GCH1 (positive) GADD45B (positive) NCOR2 (positive) SFXN3 (positive) PDLIM2 (positive) AIF1 (positive) PARVG (positive) ZAK (positive) IBRDC1 (positive) DISCUSSION Utilizing both mouse and human systems it has been shown that the class II homeobox protein Hlx affects hematopoietic stem cell function, as well as clonogenicity and differentiation of immature hematopoietic progenitor cells. Furthermore, it was found that Hlx is significantly overexpressed in the majority of patients with acute myeloid leukemias, and that high Hlx expression levels are associated with inferior clinical outcome. Thereby, this study identifies Hlx as a novel class II homeobox gene which is critically involved in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. The finding that increased Hlx expression correlates with more aggressive disease, combined with the observation that Hlx knockdown results in an inhibition of growth and clonogenicity of leukemia cells further shows that Hlx is a novel prognostic and therapeutic target. Many clustered (class I, or HOX) homeobox genes have been implicated in normal hematopoiesis as well as leukemia, but much less is known about the role of non-clustered (class II) homeobox transcription factors (for review see Argiropoulos, Humphries, Oncogene 2007). Several HOX genes are expressed at high levels in subtypes of AML (Alcalay M, Blood 2005; Ayton, Cleary, Genes Dev 2003; Horton S J, Cancer Res 2005, Bullinger, NEJM 2004). Important roles in leukemic transformation have been demonstrated specifically for several members of the HOX-A and the HOX-B cluster (Sauvageau G, Immunity 1997; Thorsteinsdottir U, MCB 1997; Kroon, EMBO J 1998; Fischbach NA, Blood 2005; Krivtsov et al., Nature 2006; Somervaille, Cleary, Cancer Cell 2006). Also, the non-clustered homeobox gene CDX2 was recently reported to be implicated in leukemogenesis (Scholl C et al., J Clin Invest 2007). However, the clinical significance of these known HOX genes is largely unclear. Here, it is reported for the first time that levels of a homeobox gene is strongly associated with inferior overall survival in several large, independent cohorts of patients with AML. Furthermore, the prognostic value of HLX is a broad phenomenon across several molecular subsets of patients, and HLX holds up as an independent prognostic factor in a multivariate model. Gene expression analyses demonstrated that Hlx regulates the expression of a specific subset of genes and that this “Hlx signature” is also able to discriminate between patients with poor and favorable clinical outcome. Taken together, these observations suggest that HLX is a key regulator of a gene subset critical for AML pathogenesis, and that it defines a previously unrecognized molecular subtype of AML with distinct biological features and clinical outcome. Several HOX genes such as Hoxb4 have been reported to be stimulators of HSC function and expansion (Savageau G, Genes Dev 1995; Antonchuk, Humphries, Cell 2002). Our data show that Hlx actually suppresses the function of normal immature HSC and progenitors, but leads to an increase of clonogenicity and a differentiation block at the level of phenotypically more mature progenitors. As the loss of HSC does not seem to be mediated by induction of apoptosis or necrosis, one may speculate that Hlx exerts this dual role by triggering initial differentiation of HSC and suppression of terminal differentiation at a more committed progenitor level. Further studies will be required to understand the molecular basis of this effect. Like other homeobox genes, Hlx may possibly function in concert with co-factors (Pineault N, MCB 2004; Moens and Selleri, Dev Biol 2006). Such co-factors could confer cell type specificity to the effects of Hlx overexpression, and also contribute to leukemic transformation. Several transcription factors that govern normal hematopoietic differentiation have been implicated in leukemogenesis by blocking differentiation and promoting self-renewal and clonogenicity (for review see Tenen D G, Nat Rev Cancer 2003). Hlx may act similar to those factors by establishing a specific gene expression program in committed progenitors, which results in increased long-term clonogenicity and a differentiation arrest, and also contributes to poor clinical outcome. Thus, Hlx expression levels may be utilized to predict clinical outcome and improve risk stratification. Furthermore, inhibition of Hlx may be a novel promising strategy for treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Methods and Materials Mice and Cells FVB/nJ mice (Ly5.1), C57BL/6J (Ly5.2) mice, and B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/BoyJ (Pep boy, Ly5.1) mice were used for in vitro assays and in vivo transplantation assays. NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wj1/SzJ (NSG) mice were used for in-vivo transplantation assays using leukemia cells. PU.1-knockdown mice with targeted disruption of the distal enhancer (URE) −14 kb upstream of the PU.1 gene have been previously described (Rosenbauer 2004). All animal experiments were performed in compliance with institutional guidelines and approved by the Animal Institute Committee of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (protocol #20080109). URE cells were established as described previously and maintained in M5300 media (Stem Cell Technologies) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 15% supernatant of WEHI-3B culture medium, 15% supernatant of BHK culture medium and penicillin/streptomycin [Steidl 2006]. Flow Cytometric Analysis and Sorting Mononuclear cells were purified by lysis of erythrocytes before analyzing BM or PB. For analysis and sorting antibodies we used directed against CD4[GK1.5], CD8a[53-6.7], CD19[eBio1D3], Gr-1[RB6-8C5], B220[RA3-6B2], F4/80[BM8], c-kit[ACK2], Sca-1[D7], CD34[RAM34], CD16/32[93], CD150[TC15-12F12.2], CD48[HM48-1], Flk-2[A2F10], Mac1[M1/70], Ter119[TER-119], and Thy-1.2[53-2-1]. To distinguish donor from host cells in transplanted mice, cells were additionally stained with anti-CD45.1[A20] and CD45.2[104]. Analysis and sorting were performed using a FACSAria II Special Order System (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). For sorting Lin−Kit+ cells for in vivo assay, TRI-color or PE-Cy5-conjugated CD4, CD8a, CD19, B220, Ter119, and Gr-1 anti-lineage antibodies were used, and APC-conjugated c-kit antibody. For analyzing hematopoietic stem and early progenitor cells, PE-conjugated Ly5.2 antibody, PE-Cy5-conjugated CD4, CD8a, CD19, B220 and Gr-1 anti-lineage antibodies, APC-conjugated c-kit antibody, pacific blue-conjugated Sca-1 antibody, PE-Cy7-conjugated Thy1.2 antibody, and biotin-conjugated Flk-2 antibody followed by APC-AlexaFluor 750 conjugated streptavidin was used. For analyzing committed progenitors APC conjugated Ly5.2 antibody, PE-Cy5-conjugated CD4, CD8a, CD19, B220 and Gr-1 anti-lineage antibodies, APC-AlexaFluor 780-conjugated c-kit antibody, pacific blue-conjugated Sca-1 antibody, PE-conjugated FcγRII/III antibody, and biotin-conjugated CD34 antibody followed by PE-Cy7-conjugated streptavidin was used. For differentiation studies, PE conjugated GR-1 antibody, APC conjugated Mac1 antibody, eFluorTM450 conjugated F4/80 antibody and APC-AlexaFluor 780-conjugated c-kit antibody were used. Lentiviral Vectors and Transduction For overexpression studies, an Hlx-expressing lentivirus was created by introducing the mouse Hlx coding sequence into the EcoRI site of a pCAD-IRES-GFP lentiviral construct (Steidl 2007). For knockdown studies, shRNA template oligonucleotides (target sense strand-loop-target antisense strand-TTTTT, luciferase target (gtgcgttgttagtactaatcctattt) were inserted as a control or mouse Hlx target (ggcgcagaaggacaaggacaaggaagcgg) for Hlx knockdown into the pSIH1-H1-copGFP shRNA vector (System Biosciences, Mountain View, Calif.). For production of lentiviral particles, lentiviral constructs were transfected with packaging vectors into 293T producer cells, harvested supernatant after 48 and 72 hours, and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. For overexpression studies, sorted Lin−Kit+ cells from wild-type C57BL/6J (Ly5.2) bone marrow (for in vivo assay) or Lin−Kit+Sca-1+ cells from wild-type FVB/nJ bone marrow (for in-vitro assay) were treated with control virus (IRES-GFP) or Hlx virus (IRES-GFP-Hlx). Briefly, sorted cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) containing heat-inactivated FBS, mIL-3, mIL-6 and mSCF with lentiviral supernatants in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene. 24 hours after transduction, cells were washed with PBS and then used for experiments. 40 hours after transduction, the efficiency of transduction was analyzed by checking the frequency of GFP-positive cells by flow-cytometry. For knockdown studies, cells were incubated with short-hairpin-containing lentivirus for 24 hours. After culture with fresh medium, GFP-positive cells were sorted using a FACS Aria II sorter (BD Biosciences) and used for experiments. Quantitative Real-Time PCR Total RNA was extracted from FACS-sorted cells or cultured cells using RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.) and then synthesized cDNA by Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). Real-time PCR was performed using an iQ5 real-time PCR detection system (BIO-RAD, Hercules, Calif.) with 1 cycle of 50° C. (2 min) and 95° C. (10 min) followed by 40 cycles of 95° C. (15 sec) and 60° C. (1 min) using Power SYBR Green PCR master mix (AB, Carlsbad, Calif.) (for primer sequences, see Table 2). Measurements were quantified using the ΔΔCT method, normalized to Gapdh, and expressed relative to the expression in indicated calibrators.

Anti-Hlx polyclonal rabbit antibody (SantaCruz, clone H-130, sc-135014) and anti-actin polyclonal goat antibody (Santa Cruz, clone C-11, sc1615) were used as primary antibodies, HPRT-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-goat antibody (Santa Cruz) were used as secondary antibodies. ECL solution (Pierce) was used for detection of bands. Cell Proliferation Assays For MTS assays, 1×104 cells per well were plated into 96-well plates with 100 μL culture medium. After incubation with 20 ul of MTS reagent (CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit, Promega), OD490 and OD650 were detected by a microplate reader (Versa max, Molecular probe). Raw values were compensated by subtraction of background, defined as [OD490-OD650] of a well with cells minus [OD490-OD650] of a well with medium only. Manual cell counts were performed culturing 1×105 cells per well in 24-well plates with 1 ml medium. Viable cells were counted using trypan blue exclusion and re-adjusted to 1×105 cells per well every 4 days. Cell Cycle Assays The Click-iTTM EdU Flow Cytometry Assay system (Invitrogen, Life Technologies) was used following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after culture of cells with EdU (10 μM) for 2 hours, cells were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde, treated with saponin containing buffer, and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 647 dye azide. DAPI was added directly before flow cytometric analysis. Apoptosis Assays Apoptotic and necrotic cells were analyzed by use of Annexin V/DAPI staining as previously described (Kawahara Blood 2008). Briefly, cells were treated with PE-AnnexinV (BD Pharmingen) and DAPI in Ca2+ containing buffer. Then cells were analyzed by flow-cytometry. Colony Formation Assays and Serial Replating Assays To investigate clonogenic capacity of lentivirus-transduced cells, these assays were performed in MethoCult M3434 (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, BC) containing IL-3, IL-6, SCF, and EPO or in MethoCult M3234 supplemented with M-CSF or GM-CSF as previously described [Cozzio, Huntly, Steidl]. GFP-positive colonies were scored 8-10 days after plating lentivirus-transduced cells using an AXIOVERT 200M microscope (Zeiss, Maple Grove, Minn.). After the first plating/scoring, we re-sorted GFP-positive cells and then proceeded with serial replating assays. Cells were replated in M3434 MethoCult and GFP-positive colonies were again scored after 10-14 days. Transplantation Assays For Hlx overexpression studies, 5×104 lentivirus-transduced Lin−Kit+ cells (Ly5.2) together with 2.5×105 spleen cells from congenic wild-type recipients (Ly5.1) were transplanted into lethally irradiated age-matched congenic wild-type recipients (Ly5.1) by retroorbital vein injection. Peripheral blood was analyzed 8 weeks and 12 weeks after transplantation. At 12 weeks, recipient mice were sacrificed and bone marrow was analyzed. Total body irradiation was delivered in a single dose of 950 cGy using a Shepherd 6810 sealed-source 137Cs irradiator. Micorarray Experiments and Analysis RNA was extracted from sorted GFP-positive cells utilizing the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). After evaluation of the quality of RNA with an Agilent2100 Bioanalyzer, total RNA was used for amplification utilizing the Nugen Ovation pico WTA system according to the manufacturer's instructions. After labeling with the GeneChip WT terminal labeling kit (Affymetrix), labelled cRNA of each individual sample was hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0ST microarrays (Affymetrix), stained, and scanned by GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G system (Affymetrix) according to standard protocols. The complete array data is deposited in the gene expression omnibus (Edgar et al., 2002) and are accessible through GEO series accession number GSE27947 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE27947). Raw data was normalized with the RMA algorithm of Affymetrix Power Tools v. 1.178 using the following parameters: apt-probeset-summarize −a rma −b MoGene-1—0-st-v1.r4.bgp −c MoGene-1—0-st-v1.r4.clf −m MoGene-1—0-st-v1.r4.mps—qc-probesets MoGene-1—0-st-v1.r4.qcc −p MoGene-1—0-st-v 1.r4.pgf −o APT—summaries—cel-files cel_list.txt. A t-test with Welch approximation for unequal group variances with p-values based on t-distribution was performed with a cutoff of p<0.05 (Hlx knockdown experiment) or p<0.1 (Hlx overexpression experiment) in Multiple Experiment Viewer v.4 pilot2 (www.tm4.org/mev/) [Ref PMID: 16939790]. Subsequently, probes with −log 10(p) value <0.05 (or <0.1 for overexpression experiments) and a group mean difference >0.5 (log 2 scale) were considered differentially expressed and used for further analysis. After filtering out unannotated and duplicate genes, the remaining genes were clustered by hierarchical clustering, with optimization of sample and gene leaf order, using Euclidean distance, complete linkage clustering. For enrichment map analysis, gene enrichment table files were generated using the DAVID bioinformatics tool, filtered for significance with p-value and FDR thresholds set at <0.05 and <0.25, respectively, and visualized using the Enrichment Map Cytoscape plugin. The gene lists were also analyzed by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis v2.0 (GSEA) (Subramanian, Tamayo, et al. (2005, PNAS 102, 15545-15550) and Mootha, Lindgren, et al. (2003, Nat Genet 34, 267-273)), using gene set size filters of min=8, max=500, the permutation type set to gene_set, MSigDB v3.0 gene sets (c2.cgp.v3.0.symbols.gmt) and a cutoff at p<0.05. Statistical Analysis The publicly available gene expression data sets with accession numbers GSE12417 (training set in U133A and U133B; test set in U133plus2.0), GSE14468, and GSE10358 (available at Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Database, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) were analyzed. Clinical outcome and mutational data for the GSE10358 dataset were obtained from a recent study of the same group (Ley, NEJM 2010). Analyses of the gene expression profiles from GSE14468, GSE12417 training set and GSE10258 were performed based on published (Gentles A J, JAMA 2010) and publicly available MASS files (available in GEO entry GSE24006) with reanalyzed data. For analysis of the test set of the GSE12417 dataset, CEL files were downloaded from GEO, and processed using GenePattern (Broad Institute, Cambridge Mass.) for normalization (ExpressionFileCreator algorithm) according to the preset parameters of the software (RMA method, with quintile normalization, background correction, median scale normalization method). All aforementioned datasets were then analyzed separately to dichotomize the population of patients of each dataset into subsets with high versus low expression of HLX transcript, using the 25th percentile of normalized HLX expression in each data set as the cutoff point. Publicly available clinical annotation accompanying each one of these data sets was then used to perform Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (GraphPad Prism 5.0) comparing clinical outcome of patients with high versus low HLX expression. Results were re-run using different methods of normalization and using different methods of calculation of the 25th percentile of HLX expression (e.g. for those datasets without available time-to-event data for some patients, repeat analysis were performed based on recalculation of the 25th percentile of HLX expression among only patients for who, overall survival information was available) and results were qualitatively consistent. Multivariate analyses using Cox regression models were performed (with Forward Conditional and Backward Conditional methods in the SPSS 18.0 statistical package) using the cytogenetic risk data and mutational status information available for patients from the GSE14468 dataset (including parameters such as age (< or >60 years old), gender, cytogenetic risk group, mutational status for FLT3ITD, FLT3D835 (TKD), NPM1, CEBPA, IDH1, IDH2, N-Ras, K-Ras, EVI1 expression and HLX status (low vs. high expression according to the 25th percentile cutoff point). Confirmatory multivariate analysis was performed in the data of the GSE10358 dataset for the clinical and molecular parameters available for that dataset. Signature Generation CEL files for publicly available gene expression datasets GSE12417 U133A, GSE12417 U133plus2, GSE10358 and GSE14468 were downloaded from the GEO database and processed separately for each dataset in dChip (biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/dchip/) for generation of DCP files. Data were then normalized and modeled according to the preset normalization parameters of the software (probe selection method: invariant set; smoothing method: running median). Patients in each dataset were characterized as having low or high HLX levels, using the 25th percentile of normalized signal for the HLX probe in each dataset as the dichotomization point. Genes differentially expressed in patients with low versus high HLX were identified using in dChip according the following criteria: ratio of average expression of >1.2 or <1.2 in patients with high vs low HLX; absolute difference in average signal in the 2 groups of >100; p-value <0.05; permutation testing (100 times) to asses false discovery rate (FDR) in each dataset. The 90th percentile of the number of probes with false discovery as part of this permutation testing was used as a cutoff to exclude from further analysis the probes with the highest p-value among those that satisfied the other comparison criteria. A common signature across different AML datasets was generated by cross-comparison of individual signatures, and this signature was then overlayed with signatures obtained from the Hlx overexpression experiment. Example 2 Further replating data was obtained showing “immortalization” of myeloid progenitors and unlimited clonogenicity with Hlx expression (see FIG. 17), and the inhibitory effect of HLX was demonstrated in several human AML cell lines (see FIG. 18). It was later discovered that Btg1 and Pak1 are functionally critical downstream genes of Hlx and mediate the anti-leukemic effect of Hlx inhibition (see FIG. 19). As such, Btg1 and Pak1 are therapeutic targets. To obtain insight into the molecular consequences of elevated Hlx levels, Hlx was overexpressed Hlx in sorted murine LSK cells and a genome-wide transcriptional analysis performed. It was found that 195 genes were significantly changed, resulting in a clearly distinguishable expression signature induced by Hlx overexpression (data not shown). Next, it was tested if this mouse LSK Hlx overexpression gene set correlated with HLX expression in the human AML patient cohorts. Specifically, the human orthologs of the mouse gene set were compared to HLX expression levels of AML patients in the different cohorts using the globaltest package in R/Bioconductor (Goeman, van de Geer, et al, 2004). A highly significant correlation was found between the mouse gene signature and HLX expression in the human AML samples (p=7.43×10-23 for GSE14468, p=2.13×10-08 for GSE10358, p=2.31×10-06 for GSE12417 (U133plus2.0), and p=5.01×10-10 for GSE12417 (U133A)). Further, differentially expressed genes were intersected from the Hlx overexpression or inhibition studies with analogously differentially expressed genes in “HLX high” versus “HLX low” patients of the GSE14468 data set, and analyzed these genes for association with survival. Thereby, an HLX-dependent core set of 17 genes (referred to as “HLX signature”) was defined correlating with HLX expression status in patients with AML (FIG. 20, upper left panel). When patients were dichotomized into “HLX signature high” versus “HLX signature low” patients (defined by the genes of the signature, excluding HLX), it was found that “HLX signature high” patients had significantly inferior overall survival (p=0.0089 (log-rank); hazard ratio (HR)=0.66 (95% confidence interval: 0.48 to 0.90); median survival: 17.22 months for HLX signature high, not reached for HLX signature low; 5-yr survival rate: 34.5% for HLX signature high, 53.9% for HLX signature low) (FIG. 20, upper right panel). To validate in an independent cohort of patients, the HLX signature was tested in the GSE10358 data set. It was found that the signature correlated strongly (p=7.8×10-11) with “HLX high” versus “HLX low” expression status in AML patients of that cohort (FIG. 20, lower left panel). Furthermore, “HLX signature high” patients showed a strikingly inferior overall survival (p=1.89×10-05 (log-rank); hazard ratio (HR)=0.42 (95% confidence interval: 0.28 to 0.62); median survival: 18.3 months for HLX signature high, not reached for HLX signature low; 5-yr survival rate: 29.0% for HLX signature high, 67.0% for HLX signature low) (FIG. 20, lower right panel). Taken together, these data suggest that elevated HLX levels cause a specific functionally critical gene expression signature in human AML and define a disease subgroup with distinct biological properties. Interestingly, PAK1 was part of the HLX-induced prognostic signature in AML patients. Given the finding that PAK1 mediates the leukemia-inhibitory effects of HLX knockdown in AML cells ex vivo (FIG. 19), it was investigated whether PAK1 expression levels alone may be functionally relevant in AML patients. AML patients were dichotomized into “PAK1 high” and “PAK1 low” expressers and the clinical outcome analyzed. The “PAK1 high” patients showed significantly inferior overall survival (p=0.00014 (log-rank)) than the “PAK1 low” patients (median: 17.7 months (PAK1 high) vs. 109.1 months (PAK1 low); 5-yr survival rate: 34.0% (PAK1 high) vs. 50.5% (PAK1 low)) (FIG. 21, upper panel). Notably, high PAK1 expression was associated with inferior overall survival only in patients of the “HLX high” group (p=0.0005 (log-rank); hazard ratio (HR)=0.62 (95% confidence interval: 0.48-0.81)); median survival: 15.8 months for PAK1 high, 42.0 months for PAK1 low; 5-yr survival rate: 29.7% for PAK1 high, 48.1% for PAK1 low), but not in the “HLX low” patients (p=0.77 (log-rank); hazard ratio (HR)=1.08 (95% confidence interval: 0.65-1.78)); 5-yr survival rate: 55.0% for PAK1 high, 55.0% for PAK1 low) (FIG. 21, lower panels). In addition, PAK1 expression levels were on average 1.5-fold higher (p=2.2×10-16) in patients of the “HLX high” group compared to “HLX low” patients (FIG. 22, upper left panel). When HLX and PAK1 gene expression was analyzed in individual patients, it was also found that a significant positive correlation of HLX and PAK1 expression existed (p=8.8×10-15, R=0.31; slide 6, upper right panel). In line with this observation, experimental overexpression of Hlx in LSK cells led to a significant increase in Pak1 mRNA expression as determined by qRT-PCR (1.9-fold, p=0.017; FIG. 22 lower panel), providing further evidence that Pak1 is a functionally critical gene downstream of Hlx. HLX was also found to be specifically elevated in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in a subset of patients classified as RAEB-2 (refractory anemia with excess of blasts 2) (FIG. 23). This subgroup has the most aggressive type of disease and is most likely to progress to overt AML. HLX elevation can be used to identify patients who are most likely to progress to AML and thus require treatment and can be a therapeutic target in MDS patients in general, too.
