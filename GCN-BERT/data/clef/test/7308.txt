No. 9,023,112, which was issued on May 5, 2015, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. RELATED ART 1. Field of the Invention The present disclosure relates to orthopedic hip implants, components thereof, and methods of preparing native tissue for implantation of a foreign object, as well as methods of implanting foreign objects such as orthopedic hips and components thereof. 2. Brief Discussion of Related Art A common problem in artificial hips is dislocation resulting from the ball of the femoral head no longer being fully seated within the acetabular cup. Dislocation is particularly problematic immediately after artificial hip replacement or revision surgery. As those skilled in the art are aware, soft tissues surrounding the natural joint are damaged or removed during surgery in order to make way for the replacement orthopedic implant. Even in circumstances of artificial joint revision surgery, soft tissues are damaged to gain access to the artificial joint. Dislocation is problematic in numerous respects. First, dislocation creates obvious kinematic problems as the joint components are not aligned to function as designed or intended. Second, dislocation usually results in joint pain from the unintended loads placed on surrounding tissues. Third, dislocation usually results in swelling of tissues surrounding the joint. Fourth, dislocation can create “popping” sounds that correlate with the ball entering and exiting the cup repetitively. Fifth, dislocation causes moments to be created in the joint. Sixth, dislocation leads to premature wear of the cup and/or femoral head, thereby increasing the likelihood of joint failure or loosening of the joint. Many hypothesizes exist as to the cause of dislocation as well as methods and devices to reduce or inhibit dislocation. For example, certain orthopedic hip joints include permanent retention rings to lock the femoral head into the acetabular cup. But these retention rings come at a price-decreased range of motion. As the age of patients undergoing joint replacement and revision surgeries drops and activity level of older adults increases, decreased range of motion is not a trade-off most patients are willing to make to inhibit dislocation. Another problem with existing THA is the incidence of femoral head separation within the acetabular cup, leading to the femoral head sliding out in the superior-lateral direction and then back in the inferior-medial direction. This incidence of sliding of the femoral head within the acetabular cup leads to the observation that present day THA do not function as a revolute joint, but rather have induced undesirable shear forces that do not exist in the native hip joint. This inducement of femoral head separation may be a main reason for the occurrence of hip dislocation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure are described and illustrated below to encompass orthopedic hip implants, components thereof, and methods of preparing native tissue for implantation of a foreign object, as well as methods of implanting foreign objects such as orthopedic hips and components thereof. Of course, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that the preferred embodiments discussed below are exemplary in nature and may be reconfigured without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. However, for clarity and precision, the exemplary embodiments as discussed below may include optional steps, methods, and features that one of ordinary skill should recognize as not being a requisite to fall within the scope of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 1, a first exemplary prosthetic hip joint 100 includes a femoral component 102 cooperating with an acetabular component 104. In exemplary form, the femoral component 102 includes a femoral stem 106 for implantation into the proximal intramedullary canal 110 of a femur 112 in order to secure the femoral component to the femur. The femoral stem 106 may be fabricated from any feasible material, including metals such as, without limitation, titanium, cobalt chromium, and stainless steel. In this exemplary embodiment, the femoral stem 106 includes a stem damper 120 to reduce vibrations transmitted between the femoral stem and the femur 112 that might contribute to loosening of the femoral stem within the intramedullary canal. More specifically, the exemplary stem damper 120 is wrapped around the femoral stem 106 so that the damper interposes the stem and femur when implanted. In exemplary form, the damper 120 comprises a sleeve that may be fabricated from one or more materials that are biologically compatible and reduce vibrations transmitted between the femoral stem 106 and the femur 112 including, without limitation, silicone rubber, elastic silicone rubber, gutta percha, saline rubber, gore-tex, polystyrene, polytetrafluoroethylene, nylon, polyethylene, polyester, silk, polyethylene teraphthalate, polyvinyl alcohol-hydrogel. But this is not the only damper used as part of the first exemplary hip joint 100. The stem damper 120 may also be inserted between a metal sleeve that is fixated with cement and/or a bone in-growth material, and the femoral stem 106. Therefore, the femoral stem 106 is locked into the metal sleeve and the damper 120 is inserted therebetween. Referencing FIG. 2, the femoral component 102 (shown without the stem damper 120) also includes a neck 130 coupled to the femoral stem 106. In this exemplary embodiment, the neck 130 includes a frustoconical end (not shown) that engages a corresponding frustoconical cavity (not shown) formed within a ball 136. In this exemplary embodiment, the ball 136 may be fabricated from any feasible material, including metals and ceramics such as, without limitation, titanium, cobalt chromium, stainless steel, and alumina. In order to reduce vibrations transmitted between the neck 130 and the ball 136, the frustoconical end includes a damper 140 that interposes the neck and ball. The exemplary damper 140 comprises a cap that conforms to the shape of the frustoconical end. Alternatively, the damper 140 may be in the shape of a ring that circumscribes the neck 130 of the femoral component 102. It should be noted that when the damper 140 is used, the frustoconical cavity formed within the ball 136 is large enough to accommodate both the cap and the frustoconical end. As with the foregoing damper, this exemplary damper 140 may be fabricated from one or more materials that are biologically compatible and reduce vibrations transmitted between the neck 130 and the ball 136 including, without limitation, silicone rubber, elastic silicone rubber, gutta percha, saline rubber, gore-tex, polystyrene, polytetrafluoroethylene, nylon, polyethylene, polyester, silk, polyethylene teraphthalate, polyvinyl alcohol-hydrogel. In addition to the dampers 120, 140 associated with the femoral component 102, the acetabular component 104 may also include its own dampers. Referring to FIG. 3, the acetabular component 104 includes an acetabular cup 150 and an acetabular insert 152. The interior of the acetabular cup 150 includes a semispherical cavity that receives a semispherical aspect of the acetabular insert 152. The acetabular cup 150 includes a damper 160 that interposes the cup and a patient's pelvis 170. In this exemplary embodiment, the acetabular cup 150 may be fabricated from any feasible material, including metals such as, without limitation, titanium, cobalt chromium, and stainless steel. In exemplary form, the damper 160 is semicircular and is mounted to the rear of the acetabular cup 150. The overall area of this damper 150 can be very small, less than 1.0 mm2 or can cover the full surface area of the acetabular cup. One or more dampers 150 may be used. By interposing the acetabular cup 150 and the pelvis 170, vibrations transmitted between the cup and pelvis are reduced. It is believed that vibrations transmitted between the cup 150 and pelvis 170 contribute to loosening of the cup and joint failure. The exemplary damper 160 may be fabricated from one or more materials that are biologically compatible and reduce vibrations transmitted between the cup 150 and the pelvis 170 including, without limitation, silicone rubber, elastic silicone rubber, gutta percha, saline rubber, gore-tex, polystyrene, polytetrafluoroethylene, nylon, polyethylene, polyester, silk, polyethylene teraphthalate, polyvinyl alcohol-hydrogel. Referencing FIG. 4, in order to reduce vibrations transmitted between the acetabular component 104 and adjacent structures, a damper 180 interposes the acetabular insert 152 and the acetabular cup 150 (shown without the damper 160). In this exemplary embodiment, the acetabular insert 152 may be fabricated from any feasible material, including metals and ceramics such as, without limitation, titanium, cobalt chromium, stainless steel, and alumina. In exemplary form, the damper 180 is semicircular and is mounted to the backside of the acetabular insert 152. The overall area of this damper 180 may be very small, for example less than 1.0 mm2, or can cover the full surface area of the acetabular cup. Either one or more dampers can be used. By interposing the acetabular cup 150 and the acetabular insert 152, vibrations transmitted between the cup and insert are reduced. It is believed that vibrations transmitted between the cup 150 and insert 152 contribute to loosening of the cup and joint failure. The exemplary damper 180 may be fabricated from one or more materials that are biologically compatible and reduce vibrations transmitted between the cup 150 and the insert 152 including, without limitation, silicone rubber, elastic silicone rubber, gutta percha, saline rubber, gore-tex, polystyrene, polytetrafluoroethylene, nylon, polyethylene, polyester, silk, polyethylene teraphthalate, polyvinyl alcohol-hydrogel. The exemplary vibrational dampers 120, 140, 160, 180 may be utilized when the resonant frequencies of adjacent components are not the same. Due to the presence of hip separation and sliding of the femoral head within the acetabular cup, impulse loads and vibrational energy are transmitted and propagated throughout the hip joint. The natural or resonant frequency of an object is the frequency at which that object will vibrate freely. If a varying force with a frequency equal to the natural frequency is applied to an object, the vibrations can become violent, a phenomenon known as resonance. Resonance is the buildup of large vibration amplitude that occurs when a structure or an object is excited at its natural frequency. Resonance can be either desirable or undesirable. In the context of acoustic resonance, a desirable resonance is exhibited by musical instruments. Conversely, undesirable resonance can lead to mechanical failures resulting in bridges collapsing and fracturing of aircraft wings. The quality of the vibration and propagation of the vibration produced by a vibrating object is dependent upon the natural frequencies of the vibrational waves produced by the object. Some objects tend to vibrate at a single frequency, while other objects vibrate and produce more complex waves with a set of frequencies. If converted to a sound, these objects create sounds that could be described as noise. The actual frequency at which an object will vibrate at is determined by the following relationship: frequency=speed/wavelength. The inventor has found it beneficial to determine the natural frequency of THA implantable components and secondary structures (e.g., bone cement) to mitigate undesirable resonance. A first exemplary method for determining resonant frequency of a component or tissue includes excitation of the component or tissue using, for example a speaker, amplifying different frequencies. For example, an accelerometer may be used on bones, attaching one tri-axial accelerometer rigidly to the bone and then when excited, the acceleration signal, once filtered, is used to determine the natural frequency of the bone. Also, a Fourier Series may be used to determine the frequency of an object in question. The Fourier Series reveals how a mathematical series of sine and cosine terms can be used to analyze a waveform. Once the Fourier Series is written for a waveform then the components of the series completely describe the frequency content of the waveform. There are four conditions that must be met in order for the Fourier Series to be useful. 1. The waveform must be periodic. This waveform must repeat time for a Fourier Series to exist. 2. If the function has discontinuities, their number must be finite in any period. 3. The function must contain a finite number of maxima and minima during any period. 4. The function must be absolutely integrable in any period; that is, [in-line-formulae]∫0T|x(t)|dt|∞[/in-line-formulae] Where x(t) describes that function. The Fourier Series, in general is: [in-line-formulae]x(t)=α0+α1cos ω0τ+α2cos 2ω0τ+. . . α0cos πω0τ+ . . . b0 sin ω0τ+b1 sin 2ω0τ+ . . . b2 sin πω0τ . . .[/in-line-formulae] where the quantity ω0 is generally measured in radians per second, and is referred to as the circular frequency. Since the motion repeats itself in 2 π it radians, then ω o = 2  π τ = 2  π  0 , where τ and are the period and frequency of the harmonic motion, usually measured in second and cycles per second, respectively. The Fourier Series can also be written in a more general form as: x  ( t ) = α n + ∑ n = 1 ∞   [ ( a n ]  cos   n   ω o  t + b n  sin   n   ω o  t ) . First, ω0 is found from the period of x (t) and is equal to [in-line-formulae]2 π/T(also, 0=1/T).[/in-line-formulae] The α0 coefficient is the DC (direct current) term and is equal to the average value of x(t) over one period. This is determined by α 0 = 1 T  ∫ 0 T  x  ( t )   t . The remaining coefficients, αn and bn, are evaluated for n—1, 2, 3, . . . by α n = 2 T  ∫ 0 T  x  ( t )  cos   n   ω o  t /  t ,  and b n = 2 T  ∫ 0 T  x  ( t )  sin   n   ω o  t /  t . Those skilled in the art may be familiar with numerous other methods that may be used to determine resonant frequencies for bodily tissue, implantable components, and secondary structures. When a patient experiences hip separation, once the femoral head slides back into the acetabular cup, an impulse load is been generated, which results in vibration being propagated throughout the hip joint. If these vibrations are at or near resonant frequencies of bone, the implanted components, and/or secondary structures, detrimental resonance can lead to premature failure. To reduce this premature failure and wear, vibrational dampers are positioned to absorb vibrations between adjacent components. In order to determine whether vibrational dampers 120, 140, 160, 180 may be preferred, the exemplary orthopedic hip joint components may be tested to determine their respective resonant frequencies. When two or more hip joint components have the same or similar resonant frequencies, one or more vibrational dampers 120, 140, 160, 180 may be utilized. It is to be understood that testing of orthopedic components is not required as a prerequisite for including vibrational dampers 120, 140, 160, 180 as part of an orthopedic hip joint. Referring to FIG. 5, an exemplary hip implant assembly 200 includes a femoral component 202, an acetabular cup 204, and an acetabular insert 206. Due to the presence of high bearing surface forces in total hip arthroplasty, the femoral component 202 may be totally or partially fabricated using highly magnetic materials that work in conjunction with highly magnetic materials that may be used to fabricate the acetabular cup 204 and/or acetabular insert 206 to reduce lower hip joint forces and/or hip separation. In this exemplary embodiment, the femoral component 202 includes a femoral stem 208 that is adapted to be implanted into the femoral intramedullary canal after the femoral bone has been properly resected. Extending proximally from the femoral stem 208 is an integral neck 210 that includes a threaded or conical end (not shown) adapted to receive a femoral ball 214. The femoral ball 214 is fabricated to include a biologically compatible metallic coating (e.g., stainless steel, titanium, titanium alloy), which surrounds a neodymium magnetic core or other ferrous core. Alternatively, the femoral ball 214 may be fabricated to include one or more permanent magnets (e.g., neodymium magnet) embedded within a biologically compatible metal substrate (e.g., stainless steel, titanium, titanium alloy). In either circumstance, the magnetic field generated by the femoral ball 214 represents a magnetic North Pole, which is pulled toward any magnetic South Pole. In order to retard dislocation of the femoral ball 214 from the acetabular insert 206, the acetabular cup 204 includes a biologically compatible metallic coating 220 (e.g., stainless steel, titanium, titanium alloy), which surrounds a ferrous core. Alternatively, the acetabular cup 204 may be fabricated to include one or more magnets embedded within a biologically compatible metal substrate (e.g., stainless steel, titanium, titanium alloy). In either circumstance, the magnetic field generated by the acetabular cup 204 represents a magnetic South Pole. Because the force between the North Pole and the South Pole is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the magnetized surfaces, it is important to reduce the distances between the Poles. In order to reduce the distances between the poles, the acetabular insert 206 may be fabricated using two considerations. First, the acetabular insert 206 may be fabricated to have a minimal thickness, thereby reducing the distance between the femoral ball 214 and the acetabular cup 204. Alternatively, or in addition, the acetabular insert 206 may itself house one or more magnets oriented so that the North Pole faces toward the acetabular cup 204 and the South Pole faces toward the femoral ball 214. In exemplary form, an acetabular insert 206 includes a bowl-shaped neodymium magnetic core or other ferrous magnetic core. This core is then overmolded or encapsulated in a biologically compatible polymer or ceramic to form a capsule 226 comprising the bearing surface of the cup 204. In exemplary form, the mean thickness of the capsule 226 is between 0.1 mm to 20 mm. Referring to FIG. 6, an alternate exemplary hip implant assembly 240 includes a femoral component 242, an acetabular cup 244, and an acetabular insert 246. The femoral component 242 includes a femoral stem 248 having an integral neck 250 that includes a threaded or conical end (not shown) adapted to receive a femoral ball 254. The femoral ball 254 is fabricated to include a biologically compatible metallic coating (e.g., stainless steel, titanium, titanium alloy), which surrounds a neodymium magnetic core or other ferrous core. Alternatively, the femoral ball 254 may be fabricated to include one or more permanent magnets (e.g., neodymium magnet) embedded within a biologically compatible metal substrate (e.g., stainless steel, titanium, titanium alloy). In either circumstance, the magnetic field generated by the femoral ball 254 represents a magnetic North Pole. In order to decrease impact forces between the femoral component 242 and the acetabular components 244, 246, the magnetic field of the femoral component and the acetabular components may be the same. Specifically, at least one of the acetabular insert 246 and the acetabular cup 244 includes a biologically compatible metallic coating 260 (e.g., stainless steel, titanium, titanium alloy), which surrounds a ferrous core. Alternatively, the acetabular cup 244 and acetabular insert 246 may be fabricated to include one or more magnets embedded within a biologically compatible metal substrate (e.g., stainless steel, titanium, titanium alloy). In either circumstance, the magnetic field generated by the acetabular cup 244 and acetabular insert 246 represents a magnetic North Pole. Because the North Poles of the femoral component 242 and the acetabular components 244, 246 operate to repel one another, the impact forces between the femoral component and the acetabular components may be reduced. Turning to FIG. 7, another alternate exemplary hip implant assembly 270 includes a femoral component 272, an acetabular cup 274, and an acetabular insert 276. The femoral component 272 includes a femoral stem 278 having an integral neck 280 that includes a threaded or conical end (not shown) adapted to receive a femoral ball 284. In this embodiment, the femoral ball 284 and the most proximal aspect 286 of the acetabular cup 274 (farthest from the femoral shaft) both have a positive polarity (i.e., North Pole), but a distal medial 288 and distal lateral aspect 290 of the acetabular cup 274 have a negative polarity (i.e., South Pole). In exemplary form, the positive-positive polarity interaction operates to decrease the compressive forces during weight-bearing activity, while the positive-negative polarity interaction resists dislocation and femoral ball separation. Referencing FIGS. 8 and 9, an additional exemplary orthopedic hip joint 300 comprises a cup component 302 and a femoral component 304 having concentric spheres. More specifically, the patient's anatomy is prepared to ensure both the cup component 302 and a femoral component 304 have a common spherical center with respect to the acetabulum. Referring to FIGS. 10-13, although it has been stated in numerous publications that the human hip is a revolute joint, whereas only three sequential rotations are present, the actual shapes of the acetabulum and femoral head of the femur are not pure spheres. In fact, the position of numerous exterior points on the acetabulum and the femoral head can be recorded and computer algorithms applied to these points to create spheres whose surface best correlates with the recorded points. In a study conducted by the inventor, it was determined that numerous spheres can be derived using sets of points on the surface of the acetabulum and the femoral head. Therefore, in a conservative sense, using sets of points on the acetabulum and on the femoral head, one could easily derive at least fifty spheres for each of the acetabulum and the femoral head that at least partially correlated with the recorded points (i.e., at least some of the recorded points would comprise an exterior point on a sphere). Therefore, if fifty spheres for the acetabulum and fifty spheres for the femoral head were chosen, this would result in twenty-five hundred combinations of spheres. But the inventor has determined that the correct combination of spheres is a concentric combination derived from the bearing surface interfaces of the acetabulum and femoral head during walking, and is derived from the cartilage surface within the acetabulum and the cartilage surface on the femoral head. Referring back to FIGS. 8 and 9, in order to design the cup component 302 and the femoral component 304, a kinematic analysis is conducted for the intended recipient of the orthopedic hip joint 300. This kinematic analysis defines points on recipient's natural femoral head in contact with the acetabulum and corresponding points on the acetabulum in contact with the femoral head. An exemplary kinematic analysis is performed to determine these spheres while the joint is under dynamic, weight-bearing, in vivo conditions. During normal gait motion, these spheres maintain concentricity. Therefore, with present imaging technology, fluoroscopy is an exemplary method of use. But other imaging modalities, like ultrasound could be used to perform the kinematic analysis. Under fluoroscopic surveillance, the patient performs normal walking. Then, the patient undergoes a second clinical imaging test using CT, MRI, or ultrasound (other technologies could also be used). In the context of a CT scan, the scanned slices of the joint are used to create a three dimensional (3D) model of the patient's pelvis and femoral bones. Then, these 3D bones are overlaid onto the two dimensional fluoroscopic images. Once all of the fluoroscopic images, or a selected chosen few fluoroscopic images are converted to 3D, the patient's hip motion may be viewed in any chosen plane. Using a collision detection analysis, the point of the femoral head in contact with the pelvis and the points of the pelvis in contact with the femoral head are determined and mapped sequentially. If one does not have the capability to determine the correct points on the acetabulum and the femoral head using the above mentioned kinematic analysis, one may alternatively use trial and error to derive the location of the concentric spheres by placing different sizes of spheres in different locations relative to the acetabulum and the femoral head for each patient until the spheres are concentric in multiple planes. Once the anatomical concentricity is established for that particular patient, the location can be mapped and relocated during surgery to ensure that the spherical centers of the implanted components are matched to the anatomical spherical centers. Referring to FIGS. 14-17, spheres are superimposed onto the points that best conform to the mapped points on the pelvis and femoral head to create individual spheres. It is important to note that these spheres may be derived using the boney anatomy or on the cartilage. The correct sphere for each patient may be dependent on the quality of cartilage and/or the concentricity of the two spheres. After the spheres are defined, the location of the center of these spheres is defined and used a target origin (or center) for the spheres of the implanted femoral head and the acetabular cup. The center of two derived spheres can be defined quite easily using numerous software packages and/or using a mathematical approach. It is important to then map out the location of the patient's anatomical sphere centers with respect to boney landmarks. The center of the chosen pelvis sphere needs to be tracked with respect to boney landmarks on the pelvis and the center of the femoral head sphere needs to be tracked with respect to boney landmarks on the femur bone. Preparation of the bones to receive prosthetic components should be done with respect to maintaining the patient's anatomical spheres. Therefore, after the bones have been prepared for the implanted components, the implanted components are implanted to maintain these spherical centers. Alternatively, a surgical navigation system or an imaging modality may be used to locate the patient's spherical center(s) and ensure that the implanted components are implanted to maintain the spherical center(s). Unlike the foregoing exemplary embodiment that is patient-specific, cost considerations may require a finite set of implant components that differ in size from one another. This finite set of implant components may include gender and ethnicity considerations, depending upon the population utilized to model the implant components. By doing so, it is anticipated that there will be more than three acetabulum spheres (presently, patients normally received a femoral head having either a 28 or 32 or 36 mm sizing) needed to fit everyone requiring a TKA. Then, knowing the proper acetabulum sphere sizes, the center of these spheres is defined and used to develop proper sizing for the acetabular cup, cup insert, and femoral ball/head components. Proper sizes for the acetabular cup, cup insert, and femoral ball/head are designed to maintain spherical concentricity throughout normal gait. Maintaining proper spherical centers also leads to the femoral stem being implanted properly so that the center of femoral head sphere is located at the origin of the acetabular cup sphere. The centers for both of these spheres (head and cup) are thus coincident with the anatomical center of the acetabulum sphere taking into account the cartilage surface. It is understood that in most sizing analysis of implants, if a bell curve is used, there is a set number of sizes that will include 90% of the subjects requiring that type of implant. Unfortunately, in a total hip arthroplasty (THA), unlike other prosthesis, such as a total knee arthroplasty (TKA), all patients receive one of three sizes. Therefore, in a perfect world, the best outcome would be that 30% of the patients receive a THA implant that may maintain concentric spheres. Unfortunately, this is not the case because a slight misalignment of the implanted components will lead to the pelvis and femoral head spheres not being concentric. Therefore, it is important to understand and derive proper spheres that allow at least 90% of the population to receive a THA with the ability to maintain their anatomic sphere concentricity. Using an exemplary kinematic analysis as discussed previously herein, one determines spherical sizes for the pelvis and spherical sizes for the femoral head that fit a predetermined percentage of patients. Although present day sizes are only 28, 32 and 36 mm femoral heads that are then mated with the acetabular cup liner, this analysis may reveal that 10 to 12 sizes of femoral heads and acetabular cup liners should be produced so that 90% of the subjects under the bell curve could receive proper femoral head and acetabular cup sizes that maintain their spherical concentricity. These sizes may not be whole numbers, but rather decimal numbers. Again, it is important that each patient receive a femoral head and acetabular component that maintains spherical concentricity after THA implantation. Using the wrong femoral head and/or acetabular cup insert size leads to these implanted spheres not being concentric with the patient's anatomical spherical concentricity. This improper sizing may lead to the inducement of shear forces, further leading to femoral head separation and/or dislocation. The shape of present day femoral stems is not able to accommodate spherical concentricity due to limited options. Therefore, it is understood that multiple neck lengths and neck angles with respect to the femoral stem may be available to the surgeon. Therefore, once the anatomical spherical center is found, it may be relocated using the spherical centers of the implanted components by utilizing various stem neck options. This may be of particular concern in case where a surgeon removes too much or not enough bone and/or the femoral cut and/or the stem is fixated into the femoral bone at an offset angle. Referring to FIGS. 18 and 19, femoral head separation in present-day THA is induced by the acetabular cup and the femoral head being implanted in a position and/or orientation that does not coincide with the proper spherical center of patient. Thus, this misplacement of these components induce shear forces so that the patient's muscular structure attempts to realign the prosthetic components to the patient's proper anatomical spherical center. FIGS. 18 and 19 show examples of present-day implants that were implanted and how these implants have not maintained the patient's proper anatomical spherical center. The dotted circle represents the implanted femoral head sphere for this patient. The half dot represents the center of this implanted femoral head sphere. The solid circle represents the anatomical acetabulum sphere derived from the weight-bearing contact points, on the cartilage, for this subject during normal walking The solid dot represents the center of this anatomical based acetabulum sphere. Unfortunately, after implantation, the femoral head is no longer rotating around this patient's anatomical spherical center. But the patient's muscular structure around the hip joint is wed to this anatomical spherical center and attempts to rotate the hip implant around this patient's anatomical spherical center. Because the patient's anatomical sphere center and prosthetic sphere centers (for ball and socket) are not coincident, shear forces are created in the implanted hip joint that lead to hip separation and/or hip dislocation. As shown in FIGS. 20 and 21, the patient's native anatomy includes an acetabulum 510 in the pelvis 512 that is adapted to receive femoral head 514 at the proximal end of the femur 516, so the femoral head is received within a cavity defined by the acetabulum to form a ball and socket joint. In a patient's native hip joint, the acetabulum 510 defines a cavity having a spherical center that is concentric with the spherical center of the femoral head 514. As the femoral head 514 pivots with respect to the acetabulum 510, this common spherical center orientation is maintained. But preexisting orthopedic hip joints do not maintain this common spherical center orientation between the cavity of the acetabulum and the femoral head. An exemplary approach for determining and maintaining this common spherical center orientation uses human anatomical landmarks, such as the femoral head ligament 520. The femoral head ligament 520 is a major constraint that is currently removed without any attempt by the surgeon to utilize its location to define cup orientation. In contrast, this exemplary technique includes retention of certain features of the acetabulum before an instrument may be used to define the location of the femoral head ligament. Referring to FIG. 22, a landmark cup or jig 530 includes an orifice 532 sized accommodate a portion of the femoral head ligament 520 that remains attached to the acetabulum 510. In this exemplary embodiment, the landmark cup 530 is bowl-shaped and includes a plurality of tabs 534. Each tab 534 includes a through hole 536 that corresponds to the location of a fastener used to secure an acetabular cup to the pelvis 512. Referencing FIG. 23, the landmark cup 530 is positioned over the acetabulum 510 so that the orifice 532 overlies the location of the femoral head ligament 520. The orifice 532 may take on various sizes and various positions within the cup 530 to mark the location of the femoral head ligament and may be used on multiple patients having variable femoral head ligament locations in the acetabulum. More specifically, after the orifice 532 is positioned to overlie the femoral head ligament 520, the cup 530 is pushed against the acetabulum 510, with the femoral head ligament extending through the orifice. Thereafter, holes are drilled into the pelvis 512 using the tab holes 536 as guides. It should be noted, however, that while the landmark cup 530 is generally in the shape of an acetabular cup, this shape is not critical. The cup 530 may be any shape, such as circular, elliptical, square, rectangular, etc., and could be of any size. What is critical is retention of at least one of the anatomical reference points associated with the acetabulum 510 so that mounting locations and/or acetabular cup orientation can be established prior to reaming of the acetabulum. Referring to FIG. 24, after the holes in the pelvis 512 are drilled, pins 560 are inserted into the holes. The landmark cup 530 is also removed, which allows for this same orientation to be utilized later in the surgery for reaming and permanent acetabular cup 570 positioning (see FIG. 29). Referencing FIG. 25, the pins 560 remain in the pelvis 512 after the landmark 530 is removed. Thereafter, as shown in FIG. 26, the acetabulum 510 is prepared to receive the permanent acetabular cup 570 (see FIG. 29). Referring to FIGS. 26 and 27, it is currently difficult for the surgeon to properly ream out the acetabulum so the acetabular cup and cup insert are positioned correctly. To help the surgeon properly ream out the acetabulum, after the landmark cup 530 has been removed, a guide pin cup 580 is secured to the acetabulum using the pins 560 that extend through corresponding openings in the guide pin cup. The guide pin cup 580 includes an opening exposing a portion of the acetabulum where the femoral head ligament is located. After the guide pin cup 580 is in position, a guide pin 582 is secured to the acetabulum at the center of the socket, referenced with respect to the femoral head ligament, and/or other bone or soft-tissue landmarks. This guide pin 582 may be 1.0 cm to 20 cm in length and have diameter from 0.1 cm to 3.0 cm, for example. The guide pin 582 may be fabricated from numerous materials such as, without limitation, cobalt chrome, steel, titanium, tantalum, and ceramics. Thereafter, the guide pin cup 580 is removed from over top of the guide pin 582 and the ancillary pins 560, which leaves the guide pin 582 mounted to the acetabulum. Using the guide pin 582 and the ancillary pins 560 on the pelvic bone, a reamer (not shown) is inserted in the socket and the acetabulum is reamed uniformly and in the correct direction to create a revised acetabulum 510′ (see FIG. 27). After reaming, the reamer and guide pin 560 are both removed, while the ancillary pins 560 are retained to guide the implanted cup into the socket. Referring to FIG. 28, the permanent acetabular cup 570 is inserted into the revised acetabulum 510′ using the guide pins 560 so as to maintain the proper orientation necessary to produce concentricity with the femoral head. Referring to FIG. 29, after the acetabular cup 570 is securely in place within the revised acetabulum 510′, the guide pins 560 are removed and the corresponding holes filled. Referring back to FIG. 20, during weight-bearing gait, the femoral head ligament 520 remains taught so that the ligament distance throughout the weight-bearing portion of the gait cycle remains constant. The location of the femoral head ligament 520 attachment site in the acetabulum 510 is identified as point A. The location of the femoral head ligament attachment 520 site on the femoral head 514 is identified as point B, Therefore, if the line constructed from point A to point B is constant throughout the weight-bearing portion of the gait cycle, then one may use this line to define the location of the proper acetabulum sphere. Since points B and C are on the same bone, a fixed body, then the distance from points B to C is always constant. Therefore, by knowing the distances from points A to B and B to C, one may construct a line from point A to point C, which is also a constant. Although this analysis is planar in nature, a fourth out-of-plane point may be used to align the longitudinal direction of the cup. By identifying the location of the femoral head ligament 520 in the acetabulum 510, prior to the acetabulum being prepared during surgery, the distance from the femoral head ligament 520 to the spherical center of the acetabular cup 570 (see FIG. 29) and the femoral head 514 is measured to ensure that the proper spherical center has been maintained. The femoral head ligament 520 is the only landmark within the acetabulum 510 that can be used to define the location of the proper spherical center. Knowing the distance from the femoral head ligament 520 attachment site, within the acetabulum 510 to the proper spherical center is crucial to the surgical alignment and implantation of the acetabular cup 570 and femoral head 514. Although the example just described may be used to define concentric spheres during surgery, one could use a number of methodologies to located and/or maintain concentric spheres post THA. In an exemplary simplistic methodology, one could attempt to define and maintain concentricity using static x-rays, but this method would be in two-dimensions and may not properly define concentricity in three-dimensions. This method may only allow one to define similar circular centers. One could also use pre-operative planning and/or imaging, such as MRI, CT scans, ultrasound and/or any other imaging modality. Most of the imaging modalities that can presently be used are static and may subject the patient to radiation exposure. One could also use intra-operative surgical navigation and/or imaging modalities to locate and/or maintain concentric spheres. Most importantly, it is important to ensure that proper cup and femoral stem orientation is chosen to ensure concentric spheres post THA surgery. Referring to FIG, 30, all present-day THA surgeries require removal of the femoral head ligament 602. But this exemplary embodiment of a prosthetic hip joint retains the femoral head ligament 602 if it is healthy. As stated previously, the femoral head ligament 602 is a stabilizing mechanism in the hip joint that couples the pelvis 603 to the femur 605. If the femoral head ligament 602 is not healthy, an artificial structure may be used to reinforce the femoral head ligament. This artificial structure may be comprised of any number of materials such as, without limitation, twine, silicone rubber, elastic silicone rubber, gutta percha, saline rubber, gore-tex, polystyrene, polytetrafluoroethylene, nylon, polyethylene, polyester, silk, polyethylene teraphthalate, and polyvinyl alcohol-hydrogel. This material may be wrapped around the femoral head ligament 602, attached to the base of the femoral head ligament attachment site in the acetabulum, inter twined within the femoral head ligament, or used in another manner to reinforce the strength of the femoral head ligament. Referencing FIGS. 30 and 31, initially, the femoral head 604 is severed from the remainder of the femur 605. A cutting instrument (not shown) is then used to shape a bone segment 610 from the femoral head 604, where the bone segment remains attached to the femoral head ligament 602. In exemplary form, the bone segment 610 is cut into a cylindrical shape having the same length as the native femoral head 604, with one end of the cylinder being mounted to the femoral head ligament 602. It should be noted that the cylindrical shape is not critical and other shapes and sizes such as, without limitation, rectangular, triangular, and rounded may be utilized as part retaining the bone segment. Referring to FIGS. 32-34, the exemplary prosthetic hip joint 600 comprises an acetabular cup 620 and an acetabular cup liner 622 each having a through orifice (not shown) that is sized to allow throughput of the femoral head ligament 602 and the bone segment 610. The exemplary prosthetic hip joint 600 also comprises a femoral ball 628, a femoral neck 630, and a femoral stem 632, where the femoral neck is integrally formed with the femoral stem. The femoral ball 628 includes a through hole (not shown) that is sized to allow insertion of the bone segment 610 so the portion of the bone segment to which the femoral head ligament is mounted is substantially flush with the exterior arcuate surface of the ball. The neck 630 includes a cavity 636 axially aligned with the through hole in order to receive a portion of the bone segment 610. In this exemplary embodiment, the cavity 636 is cylindrical. Referring to FIGS. 32-34, implantation of the exemplary prosthetic hip joint 600 includes utilizing a cutting instrument to create a bone segment 610 that is mounted at one end to the femoral head ligament 602 and free at an opposing end. The femoral head ligament 602 during this process remains attached to the pelvis 603. After the bone segment 610 is cut, the bone segment and a portion of the femoral head ligament 602 are thread through the through orifice of the acetabular cup 620. The acetabular cup 620 is then mounted to the pelvis 603. The bone segment 610 and a portion of the femoral head ligament 602 are next thread through the through orifice of the acetabular cup liner 622. The acetabular cup liner 622 is then mounted to the acetabular cup 620. Then, the bone segment 610 is thread through the through hole of the femoral ball 628 so that the end of the bone segment mounted to the femoral head ligament 602 is substantially flush with the bearing surface of the femoral ball. And at least a portion of the remaining bone segment 610 not received within the femoral ball 628 is received within the femoral neck cavity 636. The bone segment 610 may be attached to the femoral neck 630 using numerous methodologies and techniques. An exemplary method for use with the instant exemplary embodiment 600 includes applying bone cement in between the bone segment 610 and the wall(s) of the femoral neck 630 that delineate the cavity 636. Another exemplary method includes interposing bone ingrowth material between the bone segment 610 and the wall(s) of the femoral neck 630 that delineate the cavity 636. The femoral ball 628 may alternatively be tapered to create a cap-like indentation at the site where femoral head bone is received. The location on the femoral ball 628, where the femoral head bone is received thus does not have to be tapered and does not have be a cylindrical hole. In other words, the cavity on the femoral ball 628 to receive the modified femoral head bone may be any of a number of shapes. The amount of bone retained from the femoral head bone may be of any size and shape. The length of this retained femoral head bone may be long enough to be fixated within only the femoral ball 628, or it can be longer to insert through the femoral ball and into the femoral neck 630 of the femoral prosthesis. Alternatively, the retained femoral head bone may be long enough so that the distal end of the bone can pass through the femoral ball 628, through the femoral neck 630, through a portion of the femoral stem and into or through the femoral shaft 632. This technique may allow the blood supply to be maintained within the retained femoral head bone and the femoral head ligament, thus allowing the retained femoral head bone to grow into the femur. Referring to FIG. 35, an alternate exemplary embodiment 700 is the same as the foregoing prosthetic hip joint 600, except for the addition of sutures or other retention lines 702 extending between at least two of the acetabular cup, acetabular cup liner, the femur, the femoral neck and the pelvis. These sutures or retention lines 702 may be utilized like suspenders, wrapping around the acetabular cup, between the cup and the bone and then either attaching to the femoral implant component or to the femoral bone. The acetabular cup may include grooves 704 to allow the sutures or other retention lines 702 to fit between the cup and the bone and then be securely cemented to the implant and the bone or allow for the bone to grow into the cup and/or the artificial structure. Referencing FIGS. 36-38, an exemplary mobile bearing acetabular component 800 comprises an acetabular cup 802 and a repositionable cup insert 804. The repositionable cup insert 804 includes a semicircular rib 806 having a dove tail cross-section that extends circumferentially on the cup insert's exterior surface. This rib 806 is adapted to be at least partially received within a corresponding semicircular groove 808 formed on the interior of the cup 802. In this exemplary embodiment, the groove 808 takes on a dove tail shape. It should be noted, however, that other rib 806 and groove 808 shapes may be utilized such as, without limitation, the rib 806 having a T-shape and the groove 808 having a corresponding cavity to receive and retain the rib. Moreover, it is within the scope of the disclosure for the rib 806 to be located on the interior of the acetabular cup 802, while the groove 808 is located circumferentially on the cup insert 804. In this exemplary embodiment, during weight-bearing activities, the cup insert 804 is locked and cannot slide and/or extend and remains in a fixed orientation with respect to the cup 802. During non weight-bearing activities, especially those that contribute to dislocation, the cup insert 804 is allowed to translate along one axis. Specifically, the rib 806 is repositionable within the groove 808, thereby allowing the cup insert 804 to translate along one axis with respect to the cup 802. Therefore, pre-operatively, if preferred, one may determine the correct cup 802 orientation so that the cup insert 804 will perfectly translate along an axis that the patient normally uses to perform the activities that cause femoral head dislocation. The cup insert 804 slides and/or extends in both directions along that chosen axis. Thus, when the patient performs non-weight bearing tasks, the cup insert 804 extends outside of the acetabular cup 802, ensuring that the femoral head does not dislocate. This cup insert 804 may have full freedom to translate and/or rotate along one axis within the cup 802 or the cup insert 804 may be constrained with some stopping and/or locking mechanism. This stopping and/or locking mechanism may constrain the translation in either direction and allow differing amounts of translation for each patient, depending on the amount of translation needed for each patient. Referring to FIGS. 39 and 40, a second exemplary mobile bearing acetabular component 840 comprises an acetabular cup 842 and a repositionable cup insert 844. The repositionable cup insert 844 includes a semicircular rib 846 having a dove tail cross-section that extends circumferentially on the cup insert's exterior surface. This rib 846 is adapted to be at least partially received within a corresponding semicircular groove 848 formed on the interior of a semicircular track (not shown). In this exemplary embodiment, the groove 848 takes on a dove tail shape. It should be noted, however, that other rib 846 and groove 848 shapes may be utilized such as, without limitation, the rib 846 having a T-shape and the groove 848 having a corresponding cavity to receive and retain the rib. Moreover, it is within the scope of the disclosure for the rib 846 to be part of the track, while the groove 848 is located circumferentially on the cup insert 844. Another way for this implant to achieve translation in two directions is to include an intermediate liner 851 (see FIG. 39) that fits between the acetabular cup 842 and the insert liner 844. This intermediate liner 851 can be polyethylene, metal, ceramic or any other bearing surface material. The intermediate liner 851 allows for the insert liner 844 to translate along one direction with respect to the intermediate liner, while the intermediate liner 844 translates along a second direction (e.g. perpendicular to the first direction) within the acetabular cup 842. In this exemplary embodiment, the liner 851 includes a projection 852 formed on its circumferential exterior that is received within a corresponding semicircular groove 854 formed on the interior of the cup 842. In this exemplary embodiment, the groove 854 takes on a dove tail shape. It should be noted, however, that other projection 852 and groove 854 shapes may be utilized such as, without limitation, the projection 852 having a T-shape and the groove 854 having a corresponding cavity to receive and retain the projection. Moreover, it is within the scope of the disclosure for the projection 852 to be located on the interior of the acetabular cup 842, while the groove 854 is located on the circumferential exterior of the track 850. The semicircular track 850 in FIG. 39 is rotationally offset ninety degrees from the groove 854 on the interior of the circumferential cup 842. It should be noted, however, that the track 850 need not be offset to precisely ninety degrees and may be offset at a variety of angles. In the manner shown in FIG. 39, the cup insert 844 may slide toward an east or west direction with respect to the semicircular track 850 and with respect to the acetabular cup 842, thereby sliding the cup insert in an east or west arcuate direction. At the same time, the track 850 may slide toward a north or south direction with respect to the acetabular cup 842, thereby sliding the cup insert 844 in a north or south arcuate direction. In other words, the net result is that there are two degrees of freedom for net movement of the cup insert 844 with respect to the cup 842. A first degree of freedom is an arcuate motion in a north or south direction, and the second degree of freedom is an arcuate motion in an east or west direction, where the degrees of freedom are independent of one another any may be exercised individually or in tandem. Referring to FIG. 41, a third exemplary mobile bearing acetabular component 870 comprises an acetabular cup 872 and a repositionable cup insert 874. The repositionable cup insert 874 includes a semicircular rib 876 having a dove tail cross-section that extends circumferentially on the cup insert's exterior surface. This rib 876 is adapted to be at least partially received within a corresponding semicircular groove 878 formed on the interior of a semicircular track 880. In this exemplary embodiment, the groove 878 takes on a dove tail shape. It should be noted, however, that other rib 876 and groove 878 shapes may be utilized such as, without limitation, the rib 876 having a T-shape and the groove 878 having a corresponding cavity to receive and retain the rib. Moreover, it is within the scope of the disclosure for the rib 876 to be part of the track 880, while the groove 878 is located circumferentially on the cup insert 874. In this exemplary embodiment, the semicircular track 880 includes a projection 882 formed on its circumferential exterior that is received within a corresponding semicircular groove 884 formed on the interior of the cup 872. In this exemplary embodiment, the groove 884 takes on a dove tail shape. It should be noted, however, that other projection 882 and groove 884 shapes may be utilized such as, without limitation, the projection 882 having a T-shape and the groove 884 having a corresponding cavity to receive and retain the projection. Moreover, it is within the scope of the disclosure for the projection 882 to be located on the interior of the acetabular cup 872, while the groove 854 is located on the circumferential exterior of the track 850. The semicircular track 880 is rotationally repositionable with respect to the groove 884 on the interior of the circumferential cup 872. In this manner, the cup insert 874 may slide toward an east or west direction with respect to the semicircular track 880 and with respect to the acetabular cup 872, thereby sliding the cup insert in an east or west arcuate direction. In addition, the cup insert 874 is rotatable with respect to the acetabular cup 872 in 360 degrees. At the same time, the track 880 may slide toward a north or south direction with respect to the acetabular cup 872, thereby sliding the cup insert 874 in a north or south arcuate direction. In other words, the net result is that there are three degrees of freedom for net movement of the cup insert 874 with respect to the cup 872. A first degree of freedom is an arcuate motion in a north or south direction, a second degree of freedom is an arcuate motion in an east or west direction, and a third degree of freedom is axial rotation, where the degrees of freedom are independent of one another any may be exercised individually, at once, or in tandem. Another manner for this implant 870 to achieve translation and rotation could be through the use of an intermediate liner 890 that rotates freely with respect to the acetabular cup 872, but includes a groove 892 that allows the cup insert 874 to freely translate along one direction. Since the intermediate liner 890 can freely rotate, the direction of the insert liner translation may be in any direction with respect to the acetabular cup 872 and/or the patient's natural anatomy. Although most THA acetabular cups are designed to be a sphere, the cup may alternatively be elliptical allowing for the insert to translate and/or rotate to a greater amount, if deemed necessary. Referring to FIG. 42, an exemplary process for use with hip joint surgery includes removing the native femoral head 900 of a patient to reshape the neck of the femoral neck bone. After the femoral head is removed, an implanted femoral head is inserted into and/or around the reshaped femoral neck bone, resembling an implanted hip stem and femoral head. While the shaped femoral head 900′ is shown as having a cylindrical shape, it should be understood that the femoral head may be shaped in a rectangular, spherical, cylindrical, trapezoidal, or another other shape that could be beneficial for attaching a femoral ball 902 to the native bone. Although not shown in this figure, the femoral head may have a stem that inserts into the femoral neck bone. Also, the full femoral head bone anatomy does not have to be removed and the implanted femoral head may be attached onto the femoral head bone. Referencing FIG. 43, another exemplary process for use with hip joint surgery includes removing or reshaping the native femoral head 900 of a patient to resemble the neck of a prosthetic femoral component. Thereafter, a metal, ceramic or any other implantable material cylindrical sleeve 910 is positioned to circumscribe the reshaped bone 900′ (see FIG. 42) for stabilization. After the sleeve 910 is mounted to the reshaped femoral head 900′, a prosthetic femoral ball 902 is mounted to the reshaped femoral head and/or femoral neck. Referring to FIG. 44, a further exemplary process for use with hip joint surgery includes removing and/or reshaping the native femoral head and/or neck 900 of a patient to resemble the neck of a prosthetic femoral component. In this exemplary process, the femoral head 900 is reshaped and a trapezoidal sleeve 920 is positioned to circumscribe the reshaped bone for stabilization. After the sleeve 920 is mounted to the reshaped femoral head, a prosthetic femoral ball 922 is mounted to the reshaped femoral head. In the foregoing exemplary processes of FIGS. 42 and 43, it is also within the scope of the disclosure that the sleeve 910, 920 and the femoral ball 902, 922 comprise a single, integral component. Likewise, the femoral head can slide over the bone and/or the femoral sleeve, or it can also have an internal like stem that could go into the bone of the femur. It should also be noted that while the femoral head and femoral sleeve are shown as two separate pieces, the femoral head and femoral sleeve may also be one piece and/or modular to allow for these aspects to be attached creating one secure piece. Referring to FIGS. 45-49, a surgeon improperly reaming out the acetabulum may lead to the placement of the acetabular cup at a location not allowing for concentricity with the femoral head of the femoral implant. Since concentricity of these components is essential to minimize or eliminate both hip dislocation and/or femoral head separation, an irregular acetabular cup or cup insert may be required to accommodate for the improper reaming. Specifically, the exemplary irregular acetabular cup or cup insert 1000 does not have uniformity in wall thickness, radius and/or shape. This non-uniformity of either the acetabular cup and/or cup insert allows for spherical center realignment to ensure concentricity between the acetabular cup and femoral head centers. Referring to FIG. 45, present day acetabular cups 1100 all have a uniform wall thickness. Referencing FIGS. 46-48, if a surgeon reams out too much bone from one or more regions (e.g., points A-E in FIG. 46) of the acetabulum, then the surgeon can use a non-uniform acetabular cup and/or cup insert 1000, 1002, 1004. The non-uniform acetabular cup and/or cup insert 1000, 1002, 1004 has a non-uniform shape and wall thickness. The non-uniformity is used to shift the spherical center in various directions, such as, without limitation, proximal, distal, medial, and lateral. In this manner, the spherical center of the femoral component is aligned with the spherical center of the acetabular component. Referring to FIG. 49, the surgeon who reams out too much bone from the acetabulum may need a spacer 1010 that allows for the center of the acetabular cup or cup insert 1100 to be repositioned into alignment. This spacer 1010 may be mounted to the front side or back side of the acetabular cup and/or cup insert 1100. And the spacer 1010 may have a uniform of non-uniform wall thickness and shape. The spacer 1010 may be of any shape necessary to shift the spherical center in the proper direction. Exemplary materials for fabricating the spacer 1010 include, without limitation, titanium, cobalt chromium, high density polyethylene, and stainless steel. Referencing FIGS. 46-49, if the surgeon reams away too much bone in the region between points A and B, B and C, C and D or A and D of FIG. 46, the surgeon may use either a non-uniform acetabular cup or cup insert 1000, 1002, 1004 or a spacer 1010 to shift the acetabular cup spherical center to the desired direction. It is also within the scope of the disclosure to use spacers 1010 with one or more of the non-uniform acetabular cup or cup insert 1000, 1002, 1004 to further shift the acetabular cup spherical center to the desired direction. Though the above exemplary embodiments have all been discussed with respect to the hip joint, it is also within the scope of the disclosure to apply these same principles to other joints of the body including, without limitation, shoulder joint, elbow joint, and ankle joint. In other words, the shoulder joint, elbow joint, and ankle joint may be inserted wherever the foregoing describes a hip joint. And those skilled in the art should thus understand that the teachings and embodiments are equally applicable to shoulder joints, elbow joints, ankle joints, and hip joints. Following from the above description and invention summaries, it should be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that, while the methods and apparatuses herein described constitute exemplary embodiments of the present invention, the invention contained herein is not limited to this precise embodiment and that changes may be made to such embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the claims.
