Example 73. Synthesis of 3-(1-(3,5-Dimethyl-4-(4-(phenoxymethyl)benzamido)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)ethyl)-N-methylbenzamide (F2)
Step 1. Synthesis of Methyl 3-(1-Hydroxyethyl)benzoate (IF3a)
To a solution of compound IF2a (440 mg, 2.5 mmol) in MeOH (25 mL) was slowly added NaBH4 (211 mg, 5.6 mmol) and the mixture was allowed to stir at rt for 2 h. The reaction was quenched with saturated NH4Cl (50 mL) and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc. The organic phase was washed with water and brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (0-80% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford compound IF3a as a white solid (400 mg, 90%).
