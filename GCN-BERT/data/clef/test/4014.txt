CROSS-REFERENCE TO A RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application Ser. No. 61/636,184, filed Apr. 20, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Viral infections are responsible for many acute and chronic life-threatening diseases. It is estimated that about 33.4 million people are living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) worldwide. In addition, an estimated 2 billion people have been infected with hepatitis B virus, and 600,000 people die each year due to the acute or chronic consequences of the infection. Influenza is one of the most widely spread viral infections worldwide. Major influenza A pandemics include the Asian flu pandemic in 1957 (H2N2), the Hong Kong flu pandemic in 1968 (H3N2), the re-emergence of H1N1 (Russian flu) in 1970, the H5N1 bird flu in 1997 and 2003, and the outbreak of the swine flu (H1N1) in April 2009. Despite extensive efforts, the development of effective anti-viral drugs has largely been empirical. Further, as virus strains change over time, the emergence of resistant mutants further diminishes the efficacy of existing anti-viral agents. Therefore, the development of additional novel anti-viral therapeutics is needed.

In one embodiment, the compounds and compositions of the present invention are useful for treating fever in a subject. The present invention also provides for a therapeutic method by administering therapeutic or pharmaceutical compositions in a form that can be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In this context, the compound may be, for example, isolated or substantially pure. The term “carrier” refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the compound is administered. Such pharmaceutical carriers can be sterile liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum oil such as mineral oil, vegetable oil such as peanut oil, soybean oil, and sesame oil, animal oil, or oil of synthetic origin. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable methods of administration include, but are not limited to, oral, inhalation, or parenteral administration including intravenous, subcutaneous, topical, transdermal, intradermal, transmucosal, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, intracapsular, intraorbital, intracardiac, transtracheal, subcutaneous, subcuticular, intraarticular, subcapsular, subarachnoid, intraspinal, epidural and intrasternal injection, infusion, and electroporation, as well as co-administration as a component of any medical device or object to be inserted (temporarily or permanently) into a subject. In one embodiment, the subject method further comprises administering to a subject a second anti-viral agent, including but not limited to, compounds such as adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors, zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir, and seltamivir; interferons; nucleotides; siRNAs; or any of the combination thereof; and wherein the second antiviral agent can be administered prior to, subsequent to, or simultaneous with the compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the subject invention. In a specific embodiment, the subject method further comprises administering to a subject a second anti-viral agent, selected from the group consisting of zanamivir, oseltamivir, peramivir, seltamivir, and any of the combination thereof; wherein the second antiviral agent can be administered prior to, subsequent to, or simultaneous with the compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the subject invention. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The therapeutic composition, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. These compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, capsules, powders, sustained-release formulations and the like. The composition can be formulated with traditional binders and carriers such as triglycerides. Examples of suitable pharmaceutical carriers are described in “Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences” by E. W. Martin. Such compositions contain a therapeutically effective amount of the therapeutic composition, together with a suitable amount of carrier so as to provide the form for proper administration to the patient. The formulation should suit the mode of administration. In one embodiment, the composition is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a pharmaceutical composition adapted for local injection administration to human beings. Typically, compositions for local injection administration are solutions in sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the composition may also include a solubilizing agent and a local anesthetic such as lidocaine to ease pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the composition is administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients may be mixed prior to administration. The therapeutic or pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be formulated as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, sodium, potassium, magnesium, ammonium, calcium, ferric hydroxides, isopropylamine, triethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine, procaine, acetate, aspartate, citrate, fumarate, hippurate, hydrochloride, lactate salt, malate salt, phosphate, sulfate, hemi-sulfate, tartrate, gluconate, maleate, and succinate salt. The present invention also provides for the modification of the compound such that it is more stable once administered to a subject, i.e., once administered it has a longer time period of effectiveness as compared to the unmodified compound. Such modifications are well known to those of skill in the art, e.g., microencapsulation, etc. The amount of the therapeutic or pharmaceutical composition of the invention which is effective in the treatment of a particular disease, condition or disorder will depend on the nature of the disease, condition or disorder and can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In general, the dosage ranges from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 2 mg/kg. In addition, in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the disease, condition or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. For example, in order to obtain an effective mg/kg dose for humans based on data generated from rat studies, the effective mg/kg dosage in rats is divided by six. The invention also provides a pharmaceutical pack or kit comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients, e.g., compound, carrier suitable for administration.
