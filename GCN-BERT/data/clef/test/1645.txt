Example 24: Diethylamine Formylation Reaction Catalyzed by Using One of Ten Thousand of Molar Equivalent of Ruthenium Complex 1a
Under a nitrogen atmosphere in a glove box, Ruthenium complex 1a (1.2 mg, 0.002 mmol), tetrahydrofuran (2 ml) and diethylamine (1.342 g, 20 mmol) were added to a 125-mL Parr autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and taken out from the glove box, carbon dioxide and hydrogen were added at 35 atm separately. After a few minutes the total pressure was stably maintained at 60 atm. The mixture in reactor was heated and stirred in an oil bath at 120° C. for 16 hours and then cooled to room temperature in a water bath, and the remaining gas was slowly released in a fume hood to obtain a clear solution. The resulting mixture was filtered through a short silica gel column (ca. 2 cm) and washed with ethyl acetate (5 mL×3). The resulting filtrate was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the solvent was removed by distillation in vacuo to give N, N-diethylamide as a colorless liquid (0.860 g) in 54% yield.
