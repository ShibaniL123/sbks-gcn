EP 1 072 253 (Sunstar KK) discloses an oral composition comprising palatinit which exerts a synergistic effect when combined with a fluorine or zinc compound. US 5 188 820 (Cummins et al) discloses oral compositions such as dentifrices comprising a mixture of a stannous salt such as stannous fluoride or stannous pyrophosphate and a zinc salt such as zinc citrate. In a first aspect of the present invention there is provided a toothpaste according to claim 1. In comprising water-solubilised zinc citrate the toothpaste does not form zinc hydroxide upon storage in a closed container such as a toothpaste tube and hence no gassing on the resulting formation of carbon dioxide. The molar ratio between the zinc ions and the citrate ligand is from 1:1.3 to 1:1.7. Preferably, zinc citrate is present at from 0.01 to 5% by weight of the toothpaste composition, preferably from 0.5 to 3.0% by weight of the composition. This ratio between the zinc and the citrate salt provides, in this type of formulation, an optimal balance between making enough zinc ions bioavailable, and capable of interacting with bacteria, without forming a deleterious amount of water-insoluble zinc hydroxide. Preferably, the excess citrate is incorporated into the composition as an alkali metal citric acid salt such as potassium citrate or sodium citrate. The toothpaste composition also comprises water. Preferably, it comprises from 5 to 50% by weight and most preferably from 15 to 35% by weight water. The abrasive system employed in the present invention is calcium carbonate based. This does not prevent the use of non-calcium carbonate abrasives in addition, such as silicas, tungsten carbide and silicon carbide. The abrasive system is present at from 10 to 70% by weight of the composition comprising 45 to 60% by weight calcium carbonate. Preferred calcium carbonates include fine ground natural chalk since it has a surprising stability with regard to its interactivity with zinc salts. The term fine ground natural chalk (FGNC) is a known term in the art and suitable examples of such are disclosed in US 2003/0072721 A1 (Riley) the contents of which with regards to the definition, types and grades of FGNC are incorporated herein by reference. Nevertheless, by FGNC is meant chalk which is obtained by milling limestone or marble deposits. Preferably, the FGNC comprises particulate matter of weight-based median particle size ranging from 1 to 15 µm and BET surface area ranging from 0.5 to 3 m2/g. The toothpaste composition according to the invention also preferably comprises a fluoride ion source such as an alkali metal salt of monofluorophosphate, preferably sodium monofluorophosphate. Such fluoride ion source will be present at such an amount to provide free fluoride ion at from 100 to 2000 ppm, preferably from 900 to 1500 ppm. Preferably, the toothpaste according to the invention comprises an agent selected from the group consisting of anti-caries agents, anti-tartar agents, anti-malodour agents, whitening teeth agents, anti-gingivitis agents and mixtures thereof. The toothpaste according to the invention comprise further ingredients which are common in the art, such as: antimicrobial agents, e.g. chlorhexidine, sanguinarine extract, metronidazole, quaternary ammonium compounds, such as cetylpyridinium chloride; bis-guanides, such as chlorhexidine digluconate, hexetidine, octenidine, alexidine; and halogenated bisphenolic compounds, such as 2,2' methylenebis-(4-chloro-6-bromophenol);anti-inflammatory agents such as ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, aspirin, indomethacin etc.;anti-caries agents such as sodium- and stannous fluoride, aminefluorides, sodium monofluorophosphate, sodium trimeta phosphate and casein;plaque buffers such as urea, calcium lactate, calcium glycerophosphate and strontium polyacrylates;vitamins such as Vitamins A, C and E;plant extracts;desensitising agents, e.g. potassium citrate, potassium chloride, potassium tartrate, potassium bicarbonate, potassium oxalate, potassium nitrate and strontium salts;anti-calculus agents, e.g. alkali-metal pyrophosphates, hypophosphite-containing polymers, organic phosphonates and phosphocitrates etc.;biomolecules, e.g. bacteriocins, antibodies, enzymes, etc.;flavours, e.g. peppermint and spearmint oils;proteinaceous materials such as collagen;preservatives;opacifying agents;colouring agents;pH-adjusting agents;sweetening agents;pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, e.g. starch, sucrose, water or water/alcohol systems etc.;surfactants, such as anionic, nonionic, cationic and zwitterionic or amphoteric surfactants;particulate abrasive materials such as silicas, aluminas, calcium carbonates, dicalciumphosphates, calcium pyrophosphates, hydroxyapatites, trimetaphosphates, insoluble hexametaphosphates and so on, including agglomerated particulate abrasive materials, usually in amounts between 3 and 60% by weight of the oral care composition. Preferred abrasives are chalk and silica, more preferably fine ground natural chalk. Humectants such as glycerol, sorbitol, propyleneglycol, xylitol, lactitol etc.; binders and thickeners such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose (Natrosol®), xanthan gum, gum arabic etc. as well as synthetic polymers such as polyacrylates and carboxyvinyl polymers such as Carbopol®;polymeric compounds which can enhance the delivery of active ingredients such as antimicrobial agents can also be included;buffers and salts to buffer the pH and ionic strength of the oral care composition; andother optional ingredients that may be included are e.g. bleaching agents such as peroxy compounds e.g. potassium peroxydiphosphate, effervescing systems such as sodium bicarbonate/citric acid systems, colour change systems, and so on. Liposomes may also be used to improve delivery or stability of active ingredients. In a second aspect the invention presents a method of making an oral composition according to the first aspect the method comprising the steps: solubilising the zinc citrate in water;add a buffering agent until the pH reaches at least 8.5 or the natural pH of the chalk base if higher;add the remaining oral care ingredients, including the calcium carbonate abrasive. Preferably, the solubilising step comprises mixing water, zinc citrate trihydrate and alakali-metal citrate salt and mixing until the zinc citrate is fully solubilised, i.e. the composition is clear. Preferably, the buffering agent is sodium hydroxide. Preferably, humectants and preservatives are added after the mixture has been buffered to 8.5 or higher if needed. Suitable humectants include sorbitol. Preferably, the chalk is added after the humectants and is mixed until the formulation is homogenous. More preferably, the calcium carbonate is added together with the foaming agent which is preferably sodium lauryl sulphate. More preferably, these materials are added stepwise to ensure proper mixing. Preferably, the thickeners are added after the calcium carbonate and are mixed until homogenous and air-free. Preferably, a fluoride ion source, such as sodium monofluorophosphate is added before flavours are also added.

Two grammes (3.18x10-3 mole) of ZCT was placed into 100g of de-ionised water and stirred to suspend the ZCT. Independently, 20.63g (6.36x10-2 mole) of tripotassium citrate monohydrate was dissolved in 100g of de-ionised water (to form a 0.636 Molar solution) and then placed in a burette. The solution of tripotassium citrate was then titrated into the ZCT suspension until the point when the solution just clarifies. At this point, no residual sparingly soluble ZCT remains in suspension.

Therefore 2g of ZCT reacts completely with 2.5g of potassium citrate monohydrate giving, in solution, a total zinc:citrate ratio of 1:1.46 (rounded to 2:3) The original ratio of zinc:citrate in ZCT prior to stepwise addition of further citrate was 3:2. At a zinc:citrate ratio of 1:1 some of the zinc citrate remains unreacted leaving a cloudy solution, however at a zinc:citrate ratio of 2:3 all of the ZCT is reacted and is fully solubilised, i.e. there is no suspended zinc citrate left for the formation of zinc hydroxide and thus carbon dioxide in the tube.
