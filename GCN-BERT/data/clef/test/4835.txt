This patent application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional No. 61/513,865, filed 1 Aug. 2011, the disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference. The present invention relates to a process for preparing pharmaceutical compositions of fingolimod or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. In particular, the present invention relates to the preparation of stable compositions which can be incorporated into a solid dosage form. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Fingolimod is a sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P) agonist, having immunosuppressive activity. Fingolimod, in the form of its hydrochloride salt has the following formula: Fingolimod is currently marketed as an immediate release capsule for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. This formulation contains 0.5 mg equivalent of fingolimod base in the form of the hydrochloride salt. WO2010/055028, US 20100040678, US 20060275357, US20090203798, US20080311188, WO2009/48993 disclose formulations containing inter alia fingolimod. WO2010/055028 discloses crystalline forms and hydrates of fingolimod hydrochloride and pharmaceutical formulations thereof. The solid pharmaceutical formulations comprise the crystalline fingolimod hydrochloride and a sugar alcohol. The sugar alcohol can be, e.g. mannitol, maltitol, inositol, xylitol or lactitol. US 20100040678 discloses rapidly disintegrating dosage forms of S1P agonists including FTY720 (fingolimod). The compositions comprise a coating, wherein the coating comprises one or more polymer resins and one or more metal oxides. US 20060275357, US20080311188 and US20090203798 disclose pharmaceutical compositions of S1P agonists comprising a sugar alcohol, such as mannitol. WO2009/048993 discloses dosage forms containing S1P modulators and one or more excipients selected from fillers, binders, disintegrants, lubricants, flow regulators, matrix formers, plasticizers, flavouring agents and sweeteners. The applicant has discovered that certain S1P agonist compounds, and in particular, fingolimod, possess properties that can cause processing problems when preparing pharmaceutical formulations. In particular, it has been found that fingolimod particles have a strong tendency to stick to surfaces and to each other. Moreover, the applicant has found that there is a significant problem with achieving a desirable content uniformity in pharmaceutical formulations containing fingolimod. Further, fingolimod can react with certain excipients to produce degradation products in the final formulation. The present invention addresses the need to provide stable formulations of fingolimod that additionally have a desirable content uniformity by a simplified process. The applicant has found that the stability and uniformity of pharmaceutical compositions containing fingolimod is heavily dependent on the choice of excipients used in the formulation, and the process by which the formulation is prepared. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition of fingolimod comprising: (i) obtaining a intimate admixture comprising fingolimod or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and at least one surfactant (wetting agent) e.g., an intimate admixture of the fingolimod and the at least one surfactant, and (ii) optionally combining the intimate admixture from step (i) with one or more excipients. Also provided are pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms obtainable by the process. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As used herein, unless indicated otherwise, references to fingolimod include fingolimod in its free base form, or as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or solvates and hydrates of the free base or salt forms. Preferably the fingolimod is in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt, and more preferably, the fingolimod is in the form of its hydrochloride salt. As used herein, unless indicated otherwise, references to weight ratios of fingolimod are based on the equivalent free base weight of fingolimod. As used herein, unless indicated otherwise, references to total weight of the pharmaceutical composition refers to the total weight of the active agent(s) and excipient(s) and excludes any capsule shell. Unless indicated otherwise, the total weight of the pharmaceutical composition refers to the weight of the pharmaceutical composition excluding any capsule shell. As used herein the term “surfactant” is intended to mean a compound capable of changing the interface between liquid and solid, to reduce the surface tension of liquid. Thus the term “surfactants” includes those compounds known as surfactants and wetting agents. As used herein the term “excipient” is intended to mean a pharmaceutically acceptable additive mixed with the active agent(s) in a pharmaceutical composition, wherein the term “excipient” excludes the at least one surfactant in the intimate admixture. The term “intimate mixture” as used herein refers to a mixture of two or more solid components that are intimately mixed so as to comprise a mixture of closely packed components. An intimate admixture according to the present invention may be formed by any procedure that enables thorough blending of the particles of fingolimod and the at least one surfactant (wetting agent) so that the particles are in intimate contact or close association with each other. Examples of suitable processes for achieving an intimate admixture include co-blending, co-screening, co-compacting, co-compressing or a combination thereof. For example, the fingolimod and the excipient(s) can be mixed in high shear mixer, or pre-blended or triturated with a surfactant and screened using a manual or electrical screen. The resulting mixture does not require milling but can be subjected to a conical mill, ball mill, attrition mill, vibratory mill or oscillating granulator to effect deagglomeration without any significant particle size reduction of the drug particles, for example, when using Quadro Comil, by choosing a screen with a screen openings larger than the drug or the admixture particles. The present invention is based on the findings that pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising fingolimod having improved stability and/or content uniformity and which can be easily manufactured by first preparing an intimate admixture comprising fingolimod and at least one surfactant, e.g., an intimate admixture of the fingolimod with one. surfactant. The intimate admixture can then be used as a premix for the preparation of a pharmaceutical preparation or dosage forms, for example by being combined with one or more additional pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that the at least one surfactant in step (i), when present in the intimate admixture with the fingolimod prevents the fingolimod particles from adhering to each other (and thus preventing the formation of agglomerates) or to the surface of the processing equipment, and further protects the drug from exposure to other excipients which can interact with the fingolimod to cause degradation. Preferably, the intimate admixture consists essentially of fingolimod and at least one surfactant. In particular, the intimate admixture is substantially free of excipients other than the surfactant (wetting agent). For example, the intimate admixture is prepared in the absence of fillers, binders or diluents. Preferably, the intimate admixture is prepared in the absence of fillers, binders, lubricants, glidants, disintegrants or diluents. More preferably, the intimate admixture is a homogeneous mixture of the fingolimod or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and the at least one surfactant. When the intimate admixture comprises excipients (e.g., fillers, binders, lubricants, glidants disintegrants or diluents) other than the at least one surfactant, each excipient is preferably in a lower amount than the at least one surfactant, e.g., in an amount of less than about 0.2 to about 5 mg, preferably less than about 0.25 to about 1 mg, and more preferably less than about 0.5 mg, wherein the amount of the at least one surfactant is the combined amount of all the surfactant(s) used if more than one surfactant is used. In a preferred embodiment, the intimate admixture in step (i) can be prepared by a process comprising co-blending, co-screening, co-compacting, co-compressing or a combination thereof. For example, the fingolimod and the at least one surfactant can be mixed in high shear mixer, or the fingolimod can be pre-blended or triturated with the at least one surfactant and screened using a manual or electrical screen. The present invention enables the production of fingolimod compositions having good stability and content uniformity without the need to employ high ratios of the at least one surfactant. For example, the process of the invention preferably employs a weight ratio of the at least one surfactant to fingolimod (based on the free base weight) in step (i) of less than about 100:1, less than about 50:1, less than about 20:1, or less than about 10:1, wherein to determine the weight ratio the Weight of the at least one surfactant is the combined weight of all the surfactant(s) used if more than one surfactant is present in the intimate admixture. More preferably, the weight ratio of the at least one surfactant to fingolimod (based on the free base weight) is significantly less than 100:1, e.g. less than about 5:1, particularly less than about 2:1 and most preferably less than about 1.5:1. In preferred embodiments, the weight ratio of the at least one surfactant to fingolimod (based on the free base weight) in the intimate admixture of step (i) is in the range of about 10:1 to about 0.2:1, about 9:1 to 0.2:1, about 8:1 to about 0.3:1, about 5:1 to about 0.4:1, about 2.5:1 to about 0.5:1, about 2:1 to about 0.5:1, about 1.5:1 to about 0.8:1, about 1.2:1 to about 0.8:1, or most preferably about 1:1. In a preferred process according to the invention, the at least one surfactant in step (i) is preferably selected from sodium lauryl sulfate, docusate sodium, polysorbate, poloxamer, hypromellose, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, meglumine and mixtures thereof.

In an especially preferred embodiment, the intimate admixture in step (i) consists essentially of fingolimod (preferably in the form of fingolimod hydrochloride) and sodium lauryl sulfate. The fingolimod can be employed in any suitable form, for example, as the free base, or solvates, or hydrates thereof. Preferably, however, the fingolimod is in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, preferably wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable salt is an acid addition salt, and more preferably wherein the acid addition salt is selected from hydrochloride, hydrobromide, ascorbate, malate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, oxalate, phosphate, mandelate, adipate, L-aspartate, glutarate, DL-lactate, laurate, salicylate, tartrate, mesylate, citrate, benzoate, or solvates or hydrates thereof, or mixtures of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts or their solvates or hydrates. Preferably, the fingolimod is in the form of the hydrochloride salt. The intimate admixture from step (i) can be further processed into a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form by adding one or more excipients in addition to the surfactant. By ensuring that the fingolimod is first intimately mixed with a surfactant, the applicant has found that subsequent processing to form a pharmaceutical composition or dosage form is improved. In particular, the problem with fingolimod particles sticking to the processing equipment and to each other, and thus causing stability and blend uniformity problems is significantly reduced.

The method according to claim 42 wherein the intimate admixture is prepared by at least one of co-blending, co-screening, co-compacting or co-compressing a mixture of fingolimod and the surfactant. 47. The method according to claim 46 wherein the intimate admixture is prepared by co-blending a mixture of fingolimod and the surfactant, followed by screening. 48. The process of claim 18, wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable salt is an acid addition salt. 49. The process of claim 48, wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable salt is selected from hydrochloride, hydrobromide, ascorbate, malate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, oxalate, phosphate, mandelate, adipate, L-aspartate, glutarate, DL-lactate, laurate, salicylate, tartrate, mesylate, citrate, benzoate, or solvates or hydrates thereof. 50. A method of improving the stability, blend uniformity, or both of composition that includes fingolimod, comprising: preparing an intimate admixture of fingolimod and a solid surfactant, wherein when the intimate admixture comprises one or more excipients other than said solid surfactant, each of said excipients is present in said intimate admixture in an amount that is less than the amount of the solid surfactant,and,subsequently combining the intimate admixture with one or more excipients to form said composition, wherein said composition has increased stability or blend uniformity as compared to the same fingolimod composition not including said preformed intimate admixture of surfactant and fingolimod. 51. A process according to claim 32, wherein the polyethylene glycol has a molecular weight of 6000 or more.
