Neosoraphens Field of the Invention The present invention relates to compounds according to general formula (I) ; to compositions, including a pharmaceutical formulation and a combination preparation comprising one or more of the compound (s); to a process for their preparation; to uses thereof, including the use in the treatment or prevention of a viral infection or a Thl7- associated inflammatory and/or autoimmune disease. Background of the Invention T cells T cells (or thymocytes) are a class of lymphocytes, which play a key role in the defense against foreign pathogens and autoimmunity in mammals. T-cells originate from hematopoietic stem cells formed in the bone marrow and are released into blood and lymph. Different types of T cells having diverse roles in the function of the immune system are recognized; broadly speaking, T cells can be divided into the following types: T helper (Th) cells, cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) , memory T cells (TMs) , regulatory T cells (Treg cells) , and natural killer T cells (NKT cells) . T-helper cells (Th cells) are a subset of αβΤ-cells that usually express the CD4 co-receptor and have a major role in controlling and regulating the immune system by providing 'help' to other white blood cells. Accordingly, CD4 Th cells play a central role in initiating and maintaining immune responses. They have a crucial influence on the nature of an ongoing immune response, which can be either regulatory or inflammatory. Upon stimulation of the T-cell receptor, naive CD4+ T helper cells have the potential to differentiate into functionally different T helper cell lineages. Classically, Thl cells express Interferon-γ and play an important role in regulation of cellular immunity, while Th2 cells express Interleukin 4, 5 and 13 and are involved in regulation of humoral immunity and the response against extracellular parasites. Recently, a third T helper cell lineage, Thl7 cells, which produce the highly inflammatory cytokines IL17A and IL17F and other pro-inflammatory cytokines, was identified. The pro- inflammatory cytokines and chemokines expressed by Thl7 cells target both immune and non- immune cell types and Thl7 cells have been shown to play an important role in a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, e.g. psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and asthma (reviewed, e.g. in Korn, T. et al., Annu Rev Immunol 27, 485-517 (2009) ; Tesmer, L. A. et al., Immunol Rev 223, 87-113 (2008); Crome, S. et al., Clin Exp Immunol 159 (2), 109-19 (2009); and Annunziato, F. et al . , Trends Immunol, PMID : 22682163 (2012)) . Regulatory T cells, or 'Tregs' are fundamental in controlling various immune responses in that Tregs can rapidly suppress the activity of other immune cells. In particular, Tregs are crucial for the induction and maintenance of self -tolerance and for the prevention of autoimmunity (see, e.g. Sakaguchi, S., Annu Rev Immunol 22, 531-62 (2004)) . For instance, Treg defects have been discovered in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) , type I diabetes (T1D) , psoriasis, myasthenia gravis (MG) and other autoimmune diseases (Baecher-Allan, C. & Hafler, D. A., Immunol Rev 212, 203-16 (2006)). Similar links may also exist for atopy and allergic diseases (Robinson, D. S., Larche, M. & Durham, S. R., J Clin Invest 114, 1389-97 (2004) ) . For all these diseases reports exist pointing to a reduced immune suppression of the patient's Treg cells. This has led to an increasing interest in the possibility of using Tregs in immunotherapy to treat or prevent chronic infections, autoimmune diseases, allergies and transplantation-related complications, such as graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) (for a review, see Roncarolo, M. G. & Battaglia, M. , Nat Rev Immunol 7, 585-98 (2007)) . The characteristic marker of Tregs is Foxp3. Acetyl -coenzyme A carboxylase (ACQ Acetyl -coenzyme A carboxylases (ACCs) (EC 6.4.1.2) catalyze the first rate limiting step in fatty acid synthesis - the ATP dependent carboxylation of acetyl -CoA to produce malonyl-CoA. As a result, ACCs are important regulators of fat metabolism. Eukaryotic ACCs are large, multi -domain enzymes that exist in humans and other animals in two isoforms, ACC1 and ACC2. ACC1 is expressed in lipogenic tissues (e.g. liver, adipose, lactating mammary gland and others) . In these tissues the malonyl-CoA produced by ACC is used in the biosynthesis of long-chain fatty acids by the fatty acid synthase complex (FAS) . The long-chain fatty acids can then be incorporated into triacylglycerides and phospholipids. In contrast, ACC2 is expressed mostly in the heart and skeletal muscle, and in these tissues malonyl-CoA functions mainly as a potent inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation. Due to their important role in fat metabolism, ACCs have been suggested as targets for drugs (for a review, see, e.g. Tong L., Cell Mol Life Sci 62, 1784-1803 (2005) ) . Potent and selective inhibitors of acetyl -coenzyme A carboxylase, including ACC1 and ACC2 , (herein also referred to as ACC inhibitors) have been developed and reported as agents for the treatment of a variety of diseases, including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. Generally speaking, ACC inhibitors are known in the art and have been reported in the literature. For instance, ACC inhibitors and uses thereof are described in US 7956049, US2006/765530, US 2007/671150, US 2009/466639A, US 2009/466639, US 7652023, US 2005/739344, US 2006/560388, US 7553836, US 2006/765530, US 2007/671150, US 7371759, US 2003/505893, US 2004/946055, US 2012/0108619, US 2010/408127, US 2011/531744, US 2011/0230461, US 2010/315522, US 2011/444401, US 2011/0003759, US 2011/0003767, US 2010/0009982, US 2007/948213, US 2008/141228, US 2010/881234, US 2010/0280067, US 2009/174152, US 2009/247620, US 2010/771019, US 2010/0113473, US 2008/109746, US 2009/582325, US 2010/0035892, US 2007/902594, US 2009/543792, US 2006/765530, US 2007/671150, US 2009/466639, EP 2189458, US 2008/109746, WO 2012/056372, US 2010/408127, US 2011/0531744, WO 2012/090219, WO 2010/127212, WO 2010/127208, WO 2008/103382, EP 0 359 706; Tong and Harwood, J Cell Biochem 99, 1476-1488 (2006); and Corbett J.

Some of these ACC inhibitors have also been reported to have an antiviral effect on certain viruses. For instance,' Gaunt et al. (J Gen Virol, 94, 1310-1317 (2013); DOI 10.1099/ vir.0.050146-0) found that TOFA reduces the infectivity of progeny rotavirus (RV) 31-fold and viral RNA production 6- fold. The effect of TOFA on RV infectivity and RNA replication was dose-dependent , and infectivity was reduced by administering TOFA up to 4 h post-infection. For human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) a similar effect of TOFA has been demonstrated (Spencer et al . , J Virol 85(12), 5814-5824 (2011) ; doi : 10.1128/JVI .02630-10) . Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) RA has long been classified as a Thl-mediated disease, but is now also thought to be a primarily Thl7 -driven disease. Initial evidence for a pathogenic role of IL-17 in RA came from reports that IL-17 was increased in the sera and synovial fluids of RA patients. As with psoriasis, there is also increased IL-22 and IL-23 in the synovium of RA patients. Notably, the increase in IL-17 and IL-23 appears to be specific for RA, because a similar increase was not found in patients with osteoarthritis (Crome et al . , loc . cit. (2009)). Multiple sclerosis (MS) There is also a strong association between IL-17 and MS (Tesmer et al . , loc. cit. (2008)) . Studies in mice have shown that Thl7 cells play a critical role in both the induction and progression of EAE, the murine model of MS. In humans with MS it is not clear whether IL-17 mediates its potentially pathogenic effects directly or via recruitment of other immune cells. Human blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells from MS patients express the receptors for IL-17 and IL-22, and exposure of these cells to IL-17, but not IL-22, results in low expression of tight junction proteins and increased transmigration of CD4+ T cells. Moreover, IL-17 elevates expression of matrix metalloproteinase expression, leading to BBB dysfunction and neuronal apoptosis. Thus, a major pathological mechanism in MS could be IL-17 -mediated destruction of the BBB allowing easier access of myelin- specific T cells to this usually immune privileged site (from Crome et al . , loc. cit. (2009)). Psoriasis Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that results in epidermal hyper- plasia, dermal angiogenesis and infiltration of monocytes, DCs and T cells. Both Thl and Thl7 cells are implicated in the pathogenesis, as there are elevated levels of both Thl- and Thl7-associated cytokines in serum and lesional skin. The most powerful evidence for the pathogenic role of Thl7 cells in psoriasis comes from a clinical study which found that antibody-mediated blockade of the shared IL-23/IL-12 p40 subunit is an effective treatment: 81% of patients had at least a 75% improvement compared to only 2% of patients who received placebo. Targeting TNF-a is also an effective treatment for this disease, and improved clinical outcomes in this context are also associated with down-regulation of many Thl7-associated cytokines including IL-17, IL-22, IL-6, ILlb and IL-23, in addition to CCL20 and anti-microbial peptides (from Crome et al . , loc . cit. (2009)) . Inflammatory bowel disease (IBP), Ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease There is also evidence for the pathological role of Thl7 cells in inflammatory bowel disease. In this disease there are genetic, correlative and therapeutic data which all support the hypothesis that Thl7 cells drive intestinal inflammation. A large study of Europeans of different ethnicities found that a single nucleotide polymorphism in a non-coding region of the IL-23R was significantly associated with both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood and tissues of Crohn's disease patients express high levels of IL- 17, with up to 40% co-expressing IFN-g and clustering in the lamina propria. Additionally, high IL-17 is found in sera and colonic biopsies of Crohn's disease patients (from Crome et al. , loc. cit. (2009) ) . Asthma In those patients with asthma in which inflammation is nonatopic, non-IgE-dependent, and noneosinophilic , airway neutrophilia is correlated with asthma severity, suggesting a major role for neutrophils, at least in this subset of patients with asthma. Neutrophilic inflammation has also been described in sudden-onset fatal asthma and neutrophil numbers are highly elevated in status asthmaticus, thus suggesting a possible role for these cells in severe and fatal asthma. As the role of IL-17 in neutrophil recruitment to the airways is well known, in the last years several studies tried to find an association between Thl7 lymphocytes and asthma. Animal models of asthma suggest that Thl7 cells promote neutrophilic inflammation, and, in concert with Th2 cells, are important in the development of airway hyper-responsiveness. Moreover, allergic sensitization through the airway promotes Thl7 responses, and IL-17F-deficient mice have an impaired neutrophilic response to allergen. More importantly, in humans increased expression of IL-17A and IL-17F has been shown in bronchial submucosa of moderate to severe asthma, and the evaluation of induced sputum in patients with asthma revealed that neutrophilic inflammation was frequently present, particularly in the severe forms of disease. Furthermore, it has been reported that increased AHR in response to methacholine in patients with asthma positively correlates with IL-17A levels in the sputum. Finally, a polymorphism in IL-17F that results in a loss-of-function mutation is inversely related to asthma risk, (from Cosmi et a.1. , Allergy 66 (8) , 989-98 (2011) ) . Type I diabetes (not type II diabetes) Reports have shown the upregulation of Thl7 immunity (IL-17, RORC, and IL-22) and Tregs related marker FOXP3 in ex vivo derived peripheral blood memory CD4+ cells and as response to anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 stimulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes (Honkanen et al., J" Immunol 185 (3), 1959-67 (2010)) . Moreover, it was found that IL-17 contributes to apoptosis in human pancreatic islets and mouse insulinoma cells in vitro, as measured by up-regulated gene expression of stress related genes iNOS, SOD2 , COX-2 and down regulated gene expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2. The role of IL-17 as a cytokine mediating beta-cell death was further supported by a recent report, which also demonstrated IL-17 pathway activation as response to islet cell derived antigens (Arif efc al . , Diabetes 60(8), 2112-9 (2011) . Marhawa et al . showed that children with new-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D) have an increased proportion of CD45RA-CD25intFOXP31ow cells that are not suppressive and secrete significantly more IL-17 than other FOXP3+ subsets ( Marwaha et al., J Immunol 185(7), 3814-8 (2010)), which supported the plasticity of Thl7 cells in human type 1 diabetes. Moreover, these diabetic subjects had a higher proportion of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that secrete IL-17. Several studies suggest that IL-17 cells in human type 1 diabetes secrete combinations of cytokines, such as IL-17, IFN-gamma and IL-9 (Beriou et al . , J Immunol 185(1), 46-54 (2010) ) . Currently treatment of Thl7 -associated inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, asthma, atopic dermatitis, contact hypersensitivity, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune myocarditis, type I diabetes, autoimmune thyroiditis, inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, transplant rejection, is often not effective, as there is no therapy that stops or prevents the development of Thl7-associated inflammatory and autoimmune diseases directly. Similar considerations apply to the treatment of many viral infections, where treatment is often limited to the treatment of the symptoms such as fever, pain, runny nose or diarrhea, since viruses have no metabolism of their own, and accordingly are difficult to control without simultaneously damaging the body's cells. Against some viral infections, e.g. influenza (flu), herpes, and HIV, antivirals that directly target the viral pathogen are known. As a result, a need remains to provide easily applicable methods and compounds or compositions that may be used to effectively treat Thl7 -associated inflammatory and autoimmune diseases or viral infections. It is, therefore, an aim of the present invention to provide novel compounds according to general formula (I) ; a pharmaceutical formulation comprising at least one of said compounds; a combination preparation comprising at least one of said compounds; a process for their preparation as well as their use in the treatment or prevention of Thl7 -associated inflammatory and autoimmune diseases or viral infections. Preferably, such treatment is more effective and not as burdensome as current treatments and improves the lives of the patients . Summary and Description of the Invention The present invention was made in view of the prior art and the needs described above, and, therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide a novel alternative compound for treating and/or preventing a viral infection, a Thl7- associated inflammatory disease, and/or a Thl7 -associated autoimmune disease. Other objects of the present invention are to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one compound of the invention, a combination preparation comprising at least one compound of the invention and at least one further active pharmaceutical ingredient, and a compound of the invention for use as a medicament. Further objects of the present invention are to provide the use of a compound, a pharmaceutical composition or a combination preparation according to the invention in the treatment or prevention of a viral infection, a Thl7 -associated inflammatory disease, and/or a Thl7- associated autoimmune disease, and a method for the preparation of a compound according to the invention. These objects are solved by the subject matter of the attached claims. These and other aspects of the present invention will become apparent upon reference to the following detailed description and definitions. The present invention relates to a compound of the general formula (I) : (I) or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, wherein A represents a group of the formula : R1, R2 and R3, in each case, independently represents a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, CN, CF3, N02, NH2, -NHC ( =0) R4 , -NHS02R4, - (CHa -I^-W, -0 (CH2) m-L2- , -C (O) (CH2) m-L3-W, -0C(0) (CH2)m-L3-W, OC(O) 2 (CH2)m-L3-W, - (C5.6 heterocyclyl ) -L4-W, S0CH3, SOCN, SOCF3, S02CH3, S02CN, S02CF3/ S02NR5R6 , C(=0)NR5R6, COCH3, COCF3, or C(CN)3; R4, in each case, independently represents a hydrogen atom; an alkyl; alkenyl ; alkynyl ; heteroalkyl; cycloalkyl; heterocycloalkyl ; aryl ; heteroaryl; aralkyl ; or heteroaralkyl group ; R5 and R6 each independently represents a hydrogen atom; or - (CH2)m-L5; or R5 and R6 are taken together to form a 5- to 8-membered saturated, unsaturated or aromatic heterocyclic ring containing 1 to 4 N atoms or 1 to 3 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, which heterocyclic ring may be unsubstituted or mono-, di or trisubstituted by halogen atom or L5; or R5 and R6 are taken together to form a 5- to 8-membered saturated, unsaturated or aromatic heterocyclic ring containing 1 to 3 heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur, which is fused to one or two rings selected from the group consisting of cycloalkyl; heterocycloalkyl; alkylcycloalkyl ; heteroalkylcycloalkyl ; aryl; heteroaryl; aralkyl ; and heteroaralkyl ; L1, L2, L3 and L4, in each case, independently represents a single bond, O, S, NH, SO, S02, -O (CH2CH20) n- , - (OCH2CH2 ) n- , or [C(O) CH2- (OCH2CH2)2-NH]n-; L5 represents H; -(CH2)P-L6; - (CH2) p-OL6; a Ci-6 heteroalkyl ; a cycloalkyl; a heterocycloalkyl; an alkylcycloalkyl; a heteroalkylcycloalkyl; an aryl; a heteroaryl; an aralkyl; or a heteroaralkyl group ; L6 represents a Ci-6 alkyl, C3_6 alkenyl, or C3.6 alkynyl group, i which 1 to 5 H atoms may, independently of each other, be replaced by halogen atom, CN, CF3, N02, OR or NHR, and/or in which one or two non-adjacent CH2 group (s) may be replaced by O, NH, S, SO, S02i or C3_7 cycloalkyl; W represents a hydrogen atom; a Ci-6 alkyl, C3-6 alkenyl, or C3-6 alkynyl group, in which 1 to 5 H atoms may, independently of each other, be replaced by halogen atom, CN, CF3, N02, OR or NHR, and/or in which one or two non-adjacent CH2 group (s) may be replaced by O, NH, S, SO, S02, or C3-7 cycloalkyl; NR5R6 , - NHC(=0)R4, -NHS02R4, -C(0)R5, - (CH) [ (CH2) mC (O) OR4] 2 ; or a 5, 6, or 7-membered saturated, unsaturated or aromatic carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring, which carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring may be substituted by 1, 2, or 3 R7; R7, in each case, independently represents a halogen atom, an oxygen atom, a sulphur atom, CN, CF3, NH2, or N02; X1, X2, and X3 each independently represents H or CH3 ; m each independently is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 ; n each independently is an integer from 1 to 40; and p each independently is 0, 1, 2 or 3. Compounds are usually described herein using standard nomenclature or the definitions presented below. For compounds having asymmetric centers, it should be understood that (unless otherwise specified) all of the optical isomers and mixtures thereof are encompassed. Compounds with two or more asymmetric elements can also be present as mixtures of diastereomers . In addition, compounds with carbon-carbon double bonds may occur in Z- and E- forms, with all isomeric forms of the compounds being included in the present invention unless otherwise specified. Where a compound exists in various tautomeric forms, a recited compound is not limited to any one specific tautomer, but rather is intended to encompass all tautomeric forms . Recited compounds are further intended to encompass compounds in which one or more atoms are replaced with an isotope (i.e., an atom having the same atomic number but a different mass number) . By way of general example, and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include tritium and deuterium and isotopes of carbon include X1C, 13C, and 14C. Compounds according to the formulas provided herein, which have one or more stereogenic centers, have an enantiomeric excess of at least 50%. For example, such compounds may have an enantiomeric excess of at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or 98%. Some embodiments of the compounds have an enantiomeric excess of at least 99%. It will be apparent that single enantiomers (optically active forms) can be obtained by asymmetric synthesis, synthesis from optically pure precursors or by resolution of the racemates . Resolution of the racemates can be accomplished, for example, by conventional methods such as crystallization in the presence of a resolving agent, or chromatography, using, for example a chiral HPLC column. Certain compounds are described herein using a general formula that includes variables, e.g. A, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, W, X1, X2, X3, m, n, p, etc. Unless otherwise specified, each variable within such a formula is defined independently of any other variable, and any variable that occurs more than one time in a formula is defined independently at each occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-3 R3, the group may be unsubstituted or substituted with 1, 2 or 3 R3 groups, and R3 at each occurrence is selected independently from the definition of R3. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds, e. g., compounds that can be isolated, characterized and tested for biological activity. As used herein a wording defining the limits of a range of length such as, e. g., "from 1 to 5" means any integer from 1 to 5, i. e. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. In other words, any range defined by two integers explicitly mentioned is meant to comprise and disclose any integer defining said limits and any integer comprised in said range. For example, the term " Ci-6 " (or " Ci-C6") refers to 1 to 6, i.e. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, carbon atoms . A "pharmacologically acceptable salt" of a compound disclosed herein is an acid or base salt that is generally considered in the art to be suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings or animals without excessive toxicity or carcinogenicity, and preferably without irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication. Such pharmaceutical salts include mineral and organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines, as well as alkali or organic salts of acidic residues such as carboxylic acids. Suitable pharmaceutical salts include, but are not limited to, salts of acids such as hydrochloric, phosphoric, hydrobromic, malic, glycolic, fumaric, sulfuric, sulfamic, sulfanilic, formic, toluenesulfonic , methanesulfonic , benzene sulfonic, ethane disulfonic, 2 -hydroxyethylsulfonic , nitric, benzoic, 2- acetoxybenzoic , citric, tartaric, lactic, stearic, salicylic, glutamic, ascorbic, pamoic, succinic, fumaric, maleic, propionic, hydroxymaleic , hydroiodic, phenylacetic , alkanoic such as acetic, HOOC- (CH2) n-COOH where n is any integer from 0 to -4 (i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, or ) and the like. Similarly, pharmaceutically acceptable cations include, but are not limited to sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, lithium and ammonium. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize further pharmacologically acceptable salts for the compounds provided herein. In general, a pharmacologically acceptable acid or base salt can be synthesized from a parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by any conventional chemical method. Briefly, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two. Generally, the use of nonaqueous media, such as ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol or acetonitrile, is preferred. It will be apparent that each compound of formula (I) may, but need not, be present as a hydrate, solvate or non-covalent complex. In addition, the various crystal forms and polymorphs are within the scope of the present invention, as are prodrugs of the compounds of formula (I) provided herein. A "prodrug" is a compound that may not fully satisfy the structural requirements of the compounds provided herein, but is modified in vivo, following administration to a subject or patient, to produce a compound of formula I provided herein. For example, a prodrug may be an acylated derivative of a compound as provided herein. Prodrugs include compounds wherein hydroxy, carboxy, amine or sulfhydryl groups are bonded to any group that, when administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, carboxy, amino, or sulfhydryl group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate, phosphate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol and amine functional groups within the compounds provided herein. Prodrugs of the compounds provided herein may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the compounds in such a way that the modifications are cleaved in vivo to generate the parent compounds . A "substituent , " as used herein, refers to a molecular moiety that is covalently bonded to an atom within a molecule of interest. For example, a "ring substituent" may be a moiety such as a halogen, alkyl group, haloalkyl group, hydroxy, cyano, amino, nitro, mercapto, or other substituent described herein that is covalently bonded to an atom (preferably a carbon or nitrogen atom) that is a ring member. The term "substituted, " as used herein, means that any one or more hydrogens on the designated atom is replaced with a selection from the indicated substituents , provided that the designated atom's normal valence is not exceeded, and that the substitution results in a stable compound, i.e. a compound that can be isolated, characterized and tested for biological activity. When a substituent is oxo (i.e., =0) , then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. An oxo group that is a substituent of an aromatic carbon atom results in a conversion of -CH- to -C(=0)- and a loss of aromaticity. For example a pyridyl group substituted by oxo is a pyridone . As used herein, "comprising", "including", "containing", "characterized by", and grammatical equivalents thereof are inclusive or open-ended terms that do not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps. "Comprising", etc. is to be interpreted as including the more restrictive term "consisting of". As used herein, "consisting of" excludes any element, step, or ingredient not specified in the claim.

Example 1 Biosynthesis of Neosoraphens Cultivation of Sorangium cellulosum strain MSrl424 (DS 28093) : 2 ml of cryo stock culture of strain MSrl424 (DSM28093) was carefully defrosted at room temperature and subsequently cultivated for 7 days at 30 °C in a 100 mL shake flask containing 20 mL of medium S supplemented with 5 mL medium P, vitamin solution (Schlegel) and vitamin B12. After 7 days of cultivation, the 20 mL seed culture was transferred in a 250 mL shake flask containing the same medium. A 70L fermentation of strain MSrl424 (DSM 28093) was performed in the presence of 0.7L adsorber resin (Amberlite XAD-16) . At the end of the fermentation (after 14 days) the adsorber resin was harvested by sieving with a process filter. Isolation of Neosoraphenes : After sieving the adsorber resin (Amberlite XAD-16) from the culture broth, the adsorber resin was washed in an open glass column with 3L methanol/water 2:8 to remove polar substances. Subsequently the adsorber resin was extracted with 6L of methanol to yield raw Neosoraphens . After evaporation of the methanol, the residual waterphase was extracted three times with ethylacetate . The organic layer was dried, filtrated and concentrated in vacuo to give a crude extract of 9.8 g. Initial separation was achieved in two steps by silica gel column chromatography on a Reveleris Flash chromatography System. Column: Reveleris Silica 80g, Grace; Elution solvent A: dichloromethane , solvent B: acetone, gradient: 11%B 3 min. isocratic, in 12 min. up to 20%B, in 6 min. to 29%B, isocratic for 13 min. at 29%B, in 2 min. to 100%B. Flow rate: 60 mL/min. Detection at 254 nm. Based on TLC analyses the chromatography gave 8 fractions. To separate the Neosoraphenes the fractions were further chromatographed on Nucleosil SilOO, 7μτη, 250x16 mm column (Macherey+Nagel) ; Solvent: t-Butylmethylether : n- Heptane 25:75 + 1% Methanol; Flow rate: 20 mL/min; Detection: 217 nm. In some cases a additional separation on Phenomenex Gemini column C18, 10 μπι,, 250x21 mm was used. Solvent A: acetonitrile : water = 2:8 + 0.1% acetic acid; Solvent B : acetonitrile : water = 4:6 + 0.1% acetic acid, Gradient: 80%B in 30 min. up to 100%B than 20 min. 100%B; Flow rate: 20 mL/min; Detection. 215 nm. Using this procedure, 95 mg Neosoraphen M462, 340 mg Neosoraphen M464, 600 mg Neosoraphen M476, 200 mg Neosoraphen M478, and 19 mg Neosoraphen M480 were obtained .

After this time 0.2 eq DMAP and after five min 0.11 eq of Neosoraphen M476 were added. After ca. 12 h 0.1 additional eq of EDCI*HC1 and DMAP were added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for eight additional hours before NH4C1 solution was added for hydrolysis (2x volume of DMF) and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc . The organic phase was dried with MgS04, filtered and dried in vacuo. The crude product was purified by HPLC using a Waters auto purifier system equipped with a Waters XBridge column (prep C18, 5 m, 19 x 150 mm) applying a H2O+0.1% HC02H(A) /MeOH+0.1% HC02H(B) gradient from 10 %B to 90 %B in 30 min to thereby yield 31 % of the 5 -substituted Neosoraphen M476. Example 3: Chemical synthesis of a Neosoraphen M476- epoxide derivative A Neosoraphen M476 -epoxide derivative has been synthezised according to Reaction Scheme 2 shown below. Reaction Scheme 2 Example 4 : Inhibition of Thl7 and induction of Treg differentiation (in vitro) Naive mouse CD4+ T cells were cultured for 4 days under Thl7 conditions in the presence of varying concentrations of the compounds of the invention. As control, cells were cultured in the presence of DMSO only (negative control) or ACC inhibitor Soraphen A (positive control) . After 4 days, cells were restimulated with PMA/Ionomycin for 4 h and Brefeldin A for 2h and further analysed by flow cytometry. The results are shown in Fig. 1A and IB. These results show that addition of Soraphen A as well as of the compounds of the invention decreases the percentage of IL-17A producing T- cells in a dose dependent manner (Pig. 1A; EC50= 40nM) and induces the reciprocal differentiation of Foxp3+ Treg cells (Fig. IB) . Thus, the results indicate that inhibition of ACC significantly lowers formation of pro- inflammatory Thl7 cells and favours formation of Foxp3+ Tregs that are crucial for the induction and maintenance of self -tolerance and for the prevention of autoimmunity. Example 5: Inhibition of HCV infection (in vitro) To assess the inhibitory effects of Neosoraphens on HCV infection, a HCV cell-culture (HCVcc) system[1"31 was used. Unless otherwise stated, Huh7/Scr cells (provided by F. Chisari, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA) which are highly permissive for HCV propagation in vitro were employed. The experiments were performed in the context of genotype 2a (Jcl chimera141) HCVcc virus. To facilitate the quantification of infection, the bicistronic Jcl luciferase reporter construct, designated Luc-Jclt5], was used. The commercial ACC inhibitor 5- (Tetradecyloxy) -2-furoic acid (TOFA) , which has been previously described to inhibit HCV replication161 , was chosen for comparison of the antiviral activities of the Neosoraphens . The NS3-4A serine protease inhibitor VX-950[ ], a known HCV replication inhibitor, was used as positive control. Briefly, Huh7/Scr cells were seeded at a density of 1.2 x 104 cells/well in 96-well plates. One day later cells were pre-incubated for lh at 37 °C with the compounds and then inoculated with the virus and the compounds for 4h at 37 °C. Finally, virus-containing media was replaced by a fresh media-compounds mix. Firefly luciferase activities were assayed 72h post infection with the Dual-Glo® Luciferase Assay System while cytotoxicity (viability) assays were carried out with the CytoTox-Glo™ Cytotoxicity Assay (both purchased from Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) , according to manufacturer's instructions, using a plate luminometer FLUOstar OPTIMA (BMG LABTECH, Ortenberg, Germany) . Mean relative light units (RLU) were plotted as percentage relative to control infections (solvent without compounds) for both infectivity and cell viability. Infections were carried out in triplicates and measured in duplicates (mean ± SEM; n=6) . Half maximal effective concentration (EC50) and half maximal cytotoxic concentration 50 (CC50) were estimated by non- linear regression of log inhibitor vs. normalized response and used to calculate the Selectivity Index (SI) value. The results of the experiments are summarized in Table 6 below. Table 6. In vitro antiviral activity (EC50, CC50 ,SI) . References [1] Zhong J et al . , PNAS 2005;102:9294-9299.
