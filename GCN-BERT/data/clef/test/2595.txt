TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a pod disposal system for a coffee machine. BACKGROUND Coffee machines for use with coffee pods have been available for a long time. A conventional coffee machine includes a holder with numerous outlets which are capable of piercing through one side of the coffee pod. Above the coffee pod holder is a brewing chamber which can be moved upwards and downwards by using by using a handle. The brewing chamber includes one or more steam nozzles, which, when the brewing chamber is put in contact with the pod holder, penetrates the top side of the coffee pod and eject steam through the coffee pod into the outlets. The outlets are connected to a major outlet in the form of a tube, such that steam passing through the coffee pod maybe collected as coffee at the major outlet. At the end of round of brewing, the user removes the coffee pod from the steam nozzle, such that the coffee machine is ready for another round of brewing. A major drawback of the conventional coffee machine is that a user has to manually remove the coffee pod from the steam nozzle, which is non-hygienic and inconvenient. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a pod disposal system for a coffee machine where the aforementioned shortcoming is mitigated, or to at least provide a useful alternative to the trade and public.

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT According a present invention, there is provided a pod disposal system for a coffee machine. The pod disposal system includes a pod holder 2 with a recess 4, onto which a coffee pod 3 maybe placed (see FIG. 1). The recess contains numerous outlets 6, capable of piecing through the side of a coffee pod facing the recess 4. A brewing chamber 8 is provided above the coffee pod holder 2, and is moveable towards and away from the coffee pod holder 2. The brewing chamber 8 includes a brewing cylinder 10, an engaging member 12, and an ejector 14. In a preferred embodiment, the engaging member contains a plate 12 with a number of steam nozzles 16. The plate 12 is positioned directly above the brewing cylinder 10, which surrounds the steam nozzles 16. In a preferred embodiment, the steam nozzle 16 is in the form of a pin, which is capable of penetrating the top side 18 of the coffee pod, thereby engaging it. An ejector 14 is provided within the brewing cylinder 10 and is positioned beneath the steam nozzles 16 for disengaging the coffee pod 3 from the steam nozzles 16. In an embodiment of the present invention, the ejector 14 is a in the form of an ejector ring 14. The ejector ring 14 is connected to the engaging member 12 by two side panels 22, and is moveable relative to the engaging member along a central axis p (see FIG. 3). In an embodiment of the invention, the brewing chamber 8 is connected to a handle 24. In a preferred embodiment, the handle 24 contains an actuating portion 28, and an attachment portion 26, which is connected to the brewing chamber 8. The actuating portion 28 of the handle 24 is pivotally moveable (via a pivot 27) relative to the attachment portion 26, such that when a user presses the free end of the actuating portion 28 downwards, the brewing chamber is lifted up by the attachment portion 26, and when a user pulls the free end of the actuating portion 28 upwards, the attachment portion 26 pushes the brewing chamber 8 downwards onto the coffee pod holder 2. In an embodiment, the brewing chamber 8 is connected to the attachment portion 26 of the handle 24 via a pair of connectors 30. The connectors 30 are attached to the plate 12 of the engaging member via an axle 32, which penetrates the side panels 22, thereby engaging the side panels 22. According to an embodiment of the present invention, the pod disposal system 1 further includes two side walls 34, which are fixed on two opposing sides of the coffee pod holder 2 by screws 36. Each side wall 34 has a first guiding track 38 that is centrally positioned on each side wall 34 and is parallel to the height of the side wall 34. The axle 32 is slidably engaged to the first guiding track 38, such that when a user actuates the actuating portion 28 of the handle 24, the actuation causes the axle 32 to slide along the first guiding track 38, thereby moving the brewing chamber 8 upwards and downwards along the height of the side wall 34. Referring now to FIGS. 3 and 4, according to an embodiment of the invention, each side panel 22 includes a guiding track 40, which adopts an inverted “L” shape, having a vertical portion 44, and a horizontal portion 46. The ejector 14 includes a side arm 42 on two opposite sides. Each side arm 42 is slidably engaged with the guiding tack 40 on each side panels 22, such that sliding movements of the side arm 42 along the vertical portion 44 of the guiding track 40 effect movement of the ejector 14 towards and away from the engaging member 12. Accordingly, when the side arm 42 is in position X along the vertical portion 44 of the guiding track 40, that is proximal to the coffee pod holder 2 relative to the intersecting point between the vertical 44 and the horizontal portion 46, the ejector 14 is separated from the engaging member 12; and when the side arm 42 slides from position X to the intersecting point, the ejector 14 is in contact with the engaging member 12. When the side arm 42 slides from the intersecting point to the end of the horizontal portion 46 of the guiding track 40, the ejector 14 is locked in a position in which it is in contact with the engaging member 12 (i.e. the engaged configuration). In an embodiment of the present invention, the ejector 14 is a ring. In an alternative embodiment, the ejector 14 can be in the form of a plate with openings to allow penetration of the steam nozzles 16, or it could be in any other suitable form. In the engaged configuration, the side arm 42 of the ejector 14 is either at the intersecting point or position Y of the guiding track 40, the steam nozzles 16 protrudes from the ejector, allowing them to engage with the coffee pod 3, and the ejector is sandwiched between the coffee pod 3 and the engaging member 12. It can therefore be understood that, after the engagement, as the side arms 42 slide into position X of the guiding track 40, the ejector 14 separates from the engaging member 12, thereby, pushing the coffee pod 3 out of the steam nozzles 16. Turning back to FIGS. 1 and 2, according to an embodiment of the present invention, each side wall 34 of the pod disposal system 1 includes a second guiding track 48, having a vertical portion 50 and an inclined portion 52. As can be seen from FIGS. 1 and 2, the vertical portion 50 of the second guiding track 48 is substantially parallel to the height of the side wall 34, and is aligned with the first guiding track 38 along the height of the side wall 34. According to an embodiment of the invention, the side arm 42 of the ejector 14 penetrates through the guiding track 40 of the side panel 22, and slidably engages with the second guiding track 48. In an engaging position, the user presses the actuating portion 26 of the handle 24 downwards to move brewing chamber 8 downwards, such that it presses against the coffee pod holder 2. In the engaging position, the axle 32 is at the bottom end of the first guiding track 38, and the side arm 42 is at the bottom end (i.e. position A) of the vertical portion 44 of the second guiding track 48 and at position Y of the guiding track 40, the ejector 14 is in contact with the engaging member 12, the steam nozzles 16 protrudes from the ejector 14 and penetrates the coffee pod 1 thereby engaging it. In a preferred embodiment, the engaging position is also the brewing position. As the user pulls the actuating portion 26 of the handle 24 upwards, the brewing chamber 8 moves to an intermediate position, in which the axle 32 is slight above the bottom end of the first guiding track 38, and the side arm 42 is at the intersecting point between the vertical portion 44 and the inclined portion 46 of the second guiding track 48. In this position, the brewing chamber 8 is moved upwards slightly but the side arm 42 remains in position Y of the guiding track 40, such that the ejector 14 remains in the engaged configuration. It is therefore conceivable that in the intermediate position, the steam nozzles 16 remains engaged to the coffee pod 1, thereby removing it from the coffee pod holder 2 as the brewing chamber 8 moves upwards. As the user pulls the handle of the actuating portion 28 of the handle 24 further, the axle 32 moves further upwards along the first guiding track 38, and the side arm 42 enters the inclined portion 52 of the second guiding track 48. As the side arm 42 enters the inclined portion 52 of the second guiding track 48, the brewing chamber 8 is tilted at an angle (see FIG. 1). As the axle 32 reaches the top end of the first guiding track 38, and the side arm 42 reaches position B of the second guiding track 48 (i.e. the disengaging position), the side arm 42 slides from position Y to position X of the guiding track 40 on the side panel. The sliding movement of the side arm 42 from position Y to position X separates the ejector 14 from the engaging member 12, thereby disengaging the coffee pod 1 from the steam nozzles 16. As the brewing chamber 18 is tilted at an angle, it is conceivable that the coffee pod will fall into an area adjacent to the coffee pod holder 2 (as shown in FIG. 5). In a preferred embodiment, a bin may be provided adjacent to the coffee pod holder 2 to receive the used coffee pods. It can be seen that, after disposing the used coffee pod by the pod disposal system 1, the coffee machine is ready for the next round of brewing. The advantage of this invention is that the user will not have to manually remove the used coffee pod from the machine between each round of brewing.
