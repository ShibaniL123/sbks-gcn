The second step
To a solution of Compound 73 (19.1g, 130mmol) in chloroform (200 mL) was added N-bromosuccinimide (23.2 g, 130 mmol) under ice-cooling, and the mixture was stirred for 25 minutes at room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, the resulting solid was collected by filtration and washed with water to yield Compound 74 (25.4 g, yield 87%).
