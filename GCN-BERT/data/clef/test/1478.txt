[Step 3] Synthesis of compound 11419
1-ethyl-N-(3-fluorophenyl)-N-((5-(hydrazinecarbonyl)pyridin-2-yl)methyl)piperidine-4-carboxamide (0.200 g, 0.501 mmol), synthesized in step 2, and triethylamine (0.140 mL, 1.001 mmol) were dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (13 mL), and 2,2-difluoroacetic anhydride (0.082 mL, 0.751 mmol) was added to the solution at room temperature. The reaction solution was heated under reflux for 12 hours, and then cooled to room temperature to terminate the reaction. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with dichloromethane. The extract was filtered through a plastic filter to remove the solid residue and the aqueous layer, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 12 g cartridge; methanol/dichloromethane = from 0% to 15%) and concentrated, and then the obtained material was further purified by chromatography (SiO2 plate, 20 x 20 x 1 mm; methanol/dichloromethane = 10%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.015 g, 6.5%) as a white solid.
