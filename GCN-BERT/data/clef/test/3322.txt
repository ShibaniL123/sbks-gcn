TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a halogen-free flame retardant resin composition and the use thereof, in particular, the present invention relates to a halogen-free flame retardant resin composition and a prepreg, a laminate and a printed circuit board laminate made by using the same. BACKGROUND In recent years, a voice is becoming higher and higher on environmentally friendly electronic products, resulting in great developments of halogen-free technology. On the other hand, with the advent of the lead-free era, besides halogen-free and flame retardant performance for printed circuit board, the property of matching with lead-free soft solder thereof becomes important. Therefore, printed circuit laminates are required on higher thermal resistance and reliability than before. At present the main technique focuses on phosphorus-modified epoxy resin and benzoxazine resin. As is known to all, compared with ordinary epoxy resin, using phosphorus-modified epoxy resin will increase the water absorption of printed circuit laminate, and lower its thermal and moisture resistance. In order to solve the problem mentioned above, CN101691449A reports that, through synergistic flame retardancy of phenoxyphosphazene compounds and compounds having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring, the flame retardancy was greatly improved. The cured product has high glass transition temperature (Tg), good thermal resistance, high elastic rate, low dielectric dissipation as well as great flame retardancy and processability. However, the thermal resistance of this solution is limited, and its processability is not entirely satisfactory. In addition, CN 101643570A has put forward a halogen-free flame retardant resin composition, and a prepreg, a laminate and a printed circuit laminate made by using the same. The halogen-free flame retardant resin composition comprises: (A) a mixture of phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) and compound (A2) having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring, 40-80 parts by weight, and the weight ratio of the phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) and the compound (A2) having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring is 1:10-1:2; (B) a poly epoxy compound, 15-45 parts by weight; (C) a phenolic resin curing agent, 5-25 parts by weight; and (D) an imidazole compound used as curing accelerator, 0.1-1 parts by weight. However, in the technical solution, a lot of compounds having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring are added, the brittleness of the cured product is greater resulting from more addition of the compounds, therefore, the amount of the compounds cannot be too much. In addition, the action of auxiliary curing agent is ignored in the technical solution, making the performance of resin cured product obtained by the solution difficult to be further improved. Accordingly, it becomes a difficult point in the art that how to add a large amount of compounds having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring and make the resin composition achieve better comprehensive properties. DETAILED DESCRIPTION One object of the present invention lies in providing a halogen-free flame retardant resin composition. The resin composition can meet the requirements of halogen-free and flame retardant performance and excellent thermal resistance. The resin composition can also improve the brittleness of the resin by adding a large amount of dihydrobenzoxazine ring cured product which greatly improves the processability of the cured product, thereby making mass production possible.

Preferably, the present technology is a halogen-free flame retardant resin composition, according to parts by weight, comprising: (A) a mixture of phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) and compound (A2) having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring, 60-90 parts by weight, and the weight ratio of the phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) and the compound (A2) having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring is 1:15-1:5; (B) an epoxy resin with epoxy equivalent of 500-2000: 10-35 parts by weight; (C) a phenolic resin: 15-25 parts by weight; and (D) an amine curing agent: 2-7 parts by weight. The mixture of phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) and compound (A2) having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring is 45-90 parts by weight, such as 53 parts by weight, 57 parts by weight, 62 parts by weight, 68 parts by weight, 72 parts by weight, 78 parts by weight, 82 parts by weight, 87 parts by weight, or 89 parts by weight. The weight ratio of the phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) and the compound (A2) having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring is 1:25-1:2, such as 1:24, 1:22, 1:20, 1:18, 1:16, 1:14, 1:12, 1:10, 1:8, 1:6, 1:4, or 1:3. The appropriate amount of component (A) is 45-90 parts by weight, besides, to ensure that phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) and compound (A2) having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring have good flame-retardant synergistic effect and avoid negative effect of phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1), the appropriate weight ratio of the phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) and the compound (A2) having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring is 1:25-1:2. The amount of (B) epoxy resin with epoxy equivalent of 500-2000 is 10-45 parts by weight, such as 13 parts by weight, 16 parts by weight, 19 parts by weight, 22 parts by weight, 28 parts by weight, 32 parts by weight, 38 parts by weight, or 43 parts by weight. The amount of (C) phenolic resin is 10-25 parts by weight, such as 12 parts by weight, 14 parts by weight, 16 parts by weight, 18 parts by weight, 20 parts by weight, 22 parts by weight, 23 parts by weight. The appropriate amount of component (C) is 10-25 parts by weight, when less than 10 parts by weight, the glass transition temperature of the cured product is improved little, while more than 25 parts by weight, the thermal resistance of the cured product deteriorates. The amount of (D) amine curing agent is 0.5-10 parts by weight, such as 1.2 parts by weight, 2.5 parts by weight, 4 parts by weight, 6 parts by weight, 7 parts by weight, or 9 parts by weight. The present invention employs phenolic resin and an amine curing agent for synergistic curing, uses phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) and compound (A2) having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring for synergistic flame retardancy, and adds epoxy resin with epoxy equivalent of 500-2000, improving Tg, thermal resistance and processability of the resin cured product while satisfying halogen-free flame retardancy. The followings are principle explanations of the present invention: The phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) in the present invention is a nitrogen containing, phosphorus containing flame retardant, the mechanism of flame retardancy includes gas phase and solid phase flame retardancy, but if used alone, its flame retardant material is released relatively slowly, and the flame retardant efficiency is not high. Meanwhile, using too little phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) prevents achieving a flame retardant effect, and using too much can affect other properties of cured product: e.g., when a cured product is exposed to high temperature, the phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) may migrate or bleed out and the flexural modulus and other physical properties may drop dramatically. However, combining the compound (A2) having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring with flame retardancy and the phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) can synergistically accelerate the release of flame retardant from phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1), resulting in great improvement of its own flame retardancy. The present invention employs the synergistic flame retardancy between phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) and compound (A2) having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring, and adjusts the weight ratio of the phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) and the compound (A2) having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring between 1:25 and 1:2. The amount of the compound (A2) having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring is much more than the weight ratio of 1:10-1:2 disclosed in CN 101643570A. Increasing the amount of the compound (A2) having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring can reduce the cost of resin compounds, improve flame retardant efficiency of phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1), and further, the migration even bleeding out of phenoxyphosphazene compounds (A1), as well as a sharp decline in physical properties such as flexural strength and other issues could be resolved. In order to improve the brittleness of the dihydrobenzoxazine ring cured product and improve the processability of resin cured product, the epoxy resin with epoxy equivalent of 500-2000 is added in resin composition. In addition to improving its brittleness, the epoxy resin with epoxy equivalent of 500-2000 will reduce Tg and thermal resistance of resin cured product. The present invention employs synergistic curing between phenolic resin and amine curing agent. Amine curing agents cure resin depending on —NH2, —NH, and a small amount of free amine groups. If the amine value is low, activity is low, and thus the curing reaction is very slow. However, if the phenolic resin contains a large number of phenolic hydroxyl groups, the activity of which is high, that can promote curing reaction, and thus curing time is very short. Accordingly, synergistic curing between the phenolic resin and the amine curing agent can effectively overcome the migration of phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) resulting from increasing the amount of the compound (A2) having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring. The reduction of Tg and thermal resistance of the resin cured product caused by the addition of epoxy resin with epoxy equivalent of 500-2000 satisfies the halogen-free flame retardancy, and it improves the Tg, thermal resistance, and processability of the resin cured product. Phenolic resin and amine curing agent in the above proportions can play a role of synergistic curing resin, maximizing both Tg and the thermal resistance of resin cured product. In the present invention, the softening point of the phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) in the (A) component is 60-150° C. The phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) is selected from cyclic phenoxyphosphazene compound shown in structural formula (α) and chain-like phenoxyphosphazene compound shown in structural formula (β): In the formula, m is an integer of 3-25. In the formula, X is —N═P(OC6H5)3 or —N═P(O)C6H5, Y is —P(OC6H5)4 or —P(O)(C6H5)2; n is an integer of 3-100. As a preferred technical solution, the softening point of the phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) in the (A) component in the present invention is 60-150° C. The phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) is selected from a mixture of cyclic phenoxyphosphazene compound shown in structural formula (α) and chain-like phenoxyphosphazene compound shown in structural formula (β), the specific composition is shown as follows: {circle around (1)} The weight percentage of hexaphenoxycyclotriphosphazene compound (in this case, m=3) is 70-90%; {circle around (2)} The weight percentage of octaphenoxycyclotetraphosphazene compound (in this case, m=4) is 3-20%; and {circle around (3)} The weight percentage of cyclic phenoxyphosphazene compound with m≧5 and chain-like phenoxyphosphazene compound is 1-10%. The weight percentages above take the sum of {circle around (1)}, {circle around (2)} and {circle around (3)} as a benchmark, and wherein m is an integer of 3-25. wherein X is —N═P(OC6H5)3 or —N═P(O)C6H5, Y is —P(OC6H5)4 or —P(O)(C6H5)2; and n is an integer of 3-100. Compared with conventional condensed phosphate flame retardants, phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) can be dissolved in an organic solvent. Further, it is easily uniformly-dispersed in the resin composition, and has the advantage of high thermal decomposition temperature, low water absorption, high resistance to hydrolysis, etc. If using the entire cyclic phenoxyphosphazene compound, its solubility in an organic solvent is poor, and therefore, a chain-like phenoxyphosphazene compound is needed to promote its dissolution. An appropriate amount of the chain-like phenoxyphosphazene compound is required, otherwise the softening point of the phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) will turn out to be low. Furthermore, when the softening point of the phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) is lower than 60° C., it will reduce the glass transition temperature of the cured product. When the softening point is higher than 150° C., the intermiscibility of phenoxyphosphazene compound (A1) with other components will be deteriorated. The compound (A2) having a dihydrobenzoxazine ring in (A) component of the present invention can be prepared by using a compound having a phenolic hydroxyl group, methylamine, and formaldehyde. The preparation method is existing technology.

In the formula, R is any one of —C(CH3)2-, —CH2-, or R1 is 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl methane-type benzoxazine resin is MDA-type benzoxazine resin. Because the bisphenol-F benzoxazine resin mentioned above contains a methylene group in its molecular structure, it has certain rigidity to its structure as well as relatively good toughness. However, phenolphthalein benzoxazine resin and MDA-type benzoxazine resin have better thermal resistance than the bisphenol-F benzoxazine resin.

Therefore, in the case of greatly reducing the amount of phenoxyphosphazene compound, the composition also can achieve flame retardancy, i.e., the flame retardant efficiency is greatly improved and the migration even bleeding out of the phenoxyphosphazene compound. Further, a sharp decline in physical properties such as flexural strength and other issues will not appear when the board material is exposed to high temperature. (2) The flame retardant used in the halogen-free flame retardant resin composition of the present invention is a phenoxyphosphazene compound which has excellent chemical resistance and high resistance to hydrolysis. Therefore, the printed circuit metal-clad laminate made from the composition has great chemical resistance and Anti-CAF performance, i.e., high reliability. (3) The halogen-free flame retardant resin composition involved in the present invention employs benzoxazine resin as the main resin, and thus the prepreg, laminate and printed circuit using the same have the advantages of high glass transition temperature (Tg), high thermal resistance, low dielectric dissipation factor, low water absorption and low C.T.E., etc. (4) The halogen-free flame retardant resin composition involved in the present invention employs epoxy modified resin with epoxy equivalent of 500-2000.
