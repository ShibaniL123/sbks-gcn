Preparation Example 6-2 : Preparation of tert-butyl-4-(methoxy(methyl)carbamoyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate
1-(1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)piperidine-4-carboxylic acid (6.51 g, 0.022 mol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (50 ml). To the resulting solution were added 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) (6.31 g, 0.033 mol) and N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (9.62 g, 0.67 mol) and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 18 hrs. After completion of the reaction by addition of water, the solution was extracted with dichloromethane, washed with distilled water, and dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane/methanol = 10/1) to give the white title compound (5.36 g, 95.0 %).
