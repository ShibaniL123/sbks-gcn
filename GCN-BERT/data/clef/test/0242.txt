Step 1: 8-Chloro-1-(2,6-dichloro-4-fluorophenyl)-5-((2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methoxy)-2-methyl-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one
A mixture of 5,8-dichloro-1-(2,6-dichloro-4-fluorophenyl)-2-methyl-1,6-naphthyridin-4(1H)-one (intermediate 2, 0.4 g, 1.02 mmol), (2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methanol (0.674 g, 5.10 mmol), K2CO3 (0.423 g, 3.06 mmol) and DMAP (0.037 g, 0.306 mmol) in acetonitrile (10 mL) was stirred at 80Â° C. for 2 days. The solid was filtered out and the reaction mixture was then purified with silica-gel chromatography (10-50% EtOAc/heptane) to afford white solid as the title compound (0.436 g, 88%).
