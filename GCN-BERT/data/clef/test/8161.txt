CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0121967, filed on Dec. 2, 2010, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a low-temperature sintered conductive metal film and a preparation method thereof. 2. Description of the Related Art Generally, technology developments for forming fine patterns for wiring formation is receiving attention as demands increase for high reliability and high conductivity for forming an electrode or a circuit of display, FPCB, RFID, etc.; for a larger screen, high efficiency, and high resolution for display; and for using a flexible substrate. In the mean time, competitions for various flat-panel display types such as PDP and LCD have been intensified that the efforts have been made to reduce the cost of raw materials including electrode materials and the cost of processing these. Also, with various portable electronic devices getting smaller, chips used for the devices are required to have a higher density and a higher integrity. One of the general methods for forming a conductive layer such as wiring pattern, etc. on a substrate embedded in various electronic devices is the metal plating. Another methods include the heat curing of a resin after forming a wiring on a substrate by applying and printing a conductive paste, which is a liquefied thermosetting resin material, with electro-conductive powder dispersed therein, or a thin film forming method which applies a ultra-fine metal particle dispersion liquid, which is dispersed uniformly into an organic dispersion medium, onto a semiconductor substrate and then heats the liquid to eliminate an organic solvent and fuse the ultra-fine metal particles. However, the plating method has a shortcoming of a low productivity, because a growth speed of a plated film from a metal ion is slow and accordingly considerable time is required to form a thick (more than about 10 μm of thickness) conductive film, conductive layer, or layer short. And the methods of forming a conductive layer by applying or printing the conductive paste or the ultra-fine metal dispersion liquid also have a shortcoming in precisely controlling the thickness and the forming position of the conductive layer. In particular, the conductive paste comprising a resin and electro-conductive powder has a difficulty in forming the conductive layer with a high precision in terms of the forming position and shape, because the conductive layer has a relatively higher viscosity (approximately 100 mpa·s at 25° C.). But if resin element is not included in order to reduce the viscosity of the ultra-fine metal particle dispersion liquid, cracks may be created in a conductive layer and the adhesion of the conductive layer to the substrate may deteriorate for forming a thick conductive layer. Meanwhile, an inkjet technology is a new type preparation process, which has been developed amid the pursuits of productivity, cost reduction, and creation of new industrial fields with the display industry becoming larger and the process simplified. An inkjet printing is a contactless technology, which prints a pattern by means of a jetting ink ejected from a nozzle of a print head. For the inkjet printing technology, a print head technology has been developed a lot, but designing an ink has still remained as a challenge. The ink is required to meet sophisticated physiochemical characteristics to obtain optimum driving conditions and gain durability of a printing system and a desirable printing pattern. In the case of a metal ink, a preparation for homogeneous and stable nanoparticles is preferred of all things. A metal ink for inkjet, as a material mainly forming a fine conductor or a thin conductive film, uses metal nanoparticles with the particle size of a few or a few dozens of nanometers. Recently, researches to form, for example, fine conductors by means of the inkjet technology after preparing the metal ink by using silver nanoparticles are in progress, but due to a high-cost of production involved in using silver particles, there are many limitations to the industrial applications. Therefore, a need for copper nanoparticles, as a low-cost material replacement with a relatively high conductivity, has been discussed continuously, but preparing stable copper nanoparticles may be challenging due to a low stability, i.e., a high oxidativity and developing a preparation of stable copper nanoparticles in a uniform particle size is still insignificant because the growth of the particles is too fast during the preparation of the nanoparticles. Korean Patent No. 10-0911439 discloses a waterborne conductive ink for inject added with a dispersion agent and dispersion solvent of a nano silver colloid solution comprising nano silver particles with the size of 20 nm or less. Using the silver nanoparticles may make the handling easy in terms of safety and environment and is desirable for storage and dispersion stability, and may make the preparation of a conductive ink possible for printing by the inkjet method. Still, the production cost may be high due to the use of the expensive silver. Korean Patent No. 10-0833869 discloses an ink composition comprising a metal nanoparticle mixture of copper nanoparticles and silver nanoparticles and an organic solvent. The ink composition comprising the metal nanoparticle mixture of the copper nanoparticles and silver nanoparticles and the organic solvent may control an ion migration phenomenon effectively on the conductive wiring comprising silver as a material without a decline in conductivity. But, using the copper nanoparticles may pose problems of securing the stability of the copper particles and of performing a heat treatment at a high temperature after printing an ink due to a high sintering temperature of copper. Accordingly, the inventors of the present invention completed the present invention by developing a conductive metal film presenting a low sintering temperature after mixing metal nanocolloids, metal salts, and polymers, preparing a metal ink whose nanoparticles are stable, and printing the metal ink. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The objective of the present invention is to provide a low-temperature sintered conductive metal film and a method for preparing the same. In order to achieve the aforementioned objective, the present invention provides a conductive metal film or pattern prepared by printing a conductive metal ink comprising metal nanocolloids, metal salts, and polymers reacted with the metal salts, and also provides a method for preparing the conductive metal film or pattern including the following steps of: preparing metal nanocolloids (step 1); preparing a mixture by mixing metal salts and polymers (step 2); preparing a metal ink by stirring the metal nanocolloids and the metal salt/polymer mixture prepared at steps 1 and 2 (step 3); printing the metal ink prepared at step 3 (step 4); and thermally treating a product printed at step 4 (step 5). According to the present invention, the conductive metal film or pattern may have advantageous effects of a reduced production cost by using copper nanoparticles instead of conventional silver nanoparticles and of a lower sintering temperature. Due to these effects, the conventional problem of a high sintering temperature in the use of the conventional copper nanoparticles may be overcome and thus the conductive metal film or pattern according to the present invention may be applied to substrates of flexible plastic material.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Hereinafter, the present invention is described in detail. The present invention provides a conductive metal film or pattern prepared by printing a conductive metal ink comprising metal nanocolloids, metal salts, and polymers reacted with the metal salts. FIG. 1 shows the images of the conductive metal ink used for the conductive metal film or pattern according to the present invention. The conductive metal ink used for the present invention ensures a stability of metal nanoparticles by comprising metal nanocolloids, and the conductive metal film or pattern presenting a low sintering temperature, according to the present invention, may be prepared by printing the conductive metal ink. According to the present invention, the metal nanocolloids, a component of the conductive mental ink, comprise conductive mental particles selected from the group consisting of copper or aluminum. The conductive metal particles may have a high electric conductivity, existing in the form of a nanocolloid and in a stable form notwithstanding the problems associated with coagulation. The size of the conductive metal particles may desirably range between 1 and 500 nm. If the size of the metal particles is less than 1 nm, preparing the metal nanocolloids may be challenging; and if the size of the conductive metal particles exceeds 500 nm, dispersibility may deteriorate and a high sintering temperature may be required for sintering. According to the present invention, the metal nanocolloids may desirably include a conductive metal with 0.1 or 80 wt %. If the metal nanocolloids include a conductive metal with less than 0.1 wt %, the electric conductivity of the conductive metal film or pattern according to the present invention may deteriorate due to a shortage of metal particles in the ink; and if metal nanocolloids include a conductive metal with over 80 wt %, printability may deteriorate due to a degraded fluidity. According to the present invention, the metal salts, a component of the metal ink, may desirably be selected from the group consisting of metal organics, metal nitrides, and metal chlorides. Due to the inclusion of the metal compounds, conductive metal atoms may be precipitated from the metal compounds and the electric conductivity of the conductive metal film or pattern according to the present invention may improve as the conductive metal atoms fill the gaps between the metal nanoparticles. According to the present invention, the polymers reacted with the metal salts in the metal ink may desirably be selected from the group consisting of polyvinyl pyrrolidone, ethylene diamine, and diethyleneamine. The polymers may overcome a problem of a high sintering temperature of copper particles to prepare a conductive metal ink presenting a low sintering temperature. According to the present invention, the metal ink may additionally include a viscosity controlling agent. Due to the inclusion of the viscosity controlling agent, a viscosity of the conductive metal ink used for the present invention may be controlled and thus the adhesion to a substrate may be desirable for printing the conductive metal film or pattern according to the present invention. Printing the conductive pattern or conductive metal film according to the present invention may be performed by a method selected from the group consisting of gravure printing, offset printing, inkjet printing, screen printing, imprint, and spin coating. Those printing methods, unlike a conventional method for preparing a pattern or film, prepare a pattern or film through one process of printing an ink. Therefore, printing the conductive pattern or conductive metal film according to the present invention may be performed by means of one-step process. Furthermore, the present invention provides a method for preparing the conductive metal film or pattern including the following steps of: preparing metal nanocolloids (step 1); preparing a mixture by mixing metal salts and polymers (step 2); preparing a metal ink by stirring the metal nanocolloids and the metal salt/polymer mixture prepared at steps 1 and 2 (step 3); printing the metal ink prepared at step 3 (step 4); and heating the product printed at step 4 (step 5). FIG. 2 schematically illustrates the procedure of the preparation method. According to one embodiment, step 1 prepares metal nanocolloids. The metal nanocolloids at step 1 may be desirable for dispersibility as the conductive metal particles are dispersed in the form of a colloid and for storage stability with stable nanoparticles. The metal nanocolloids may desirably be prepared by means of an electrical wire explosion method, but not limited thereto. The most important things in the preparation of the metal nanoparticles include preparing unpolluted high-purity particles in an economical way and taking a follow-up measure for treating the prepared particles without pollution. The electrical wire explosion method may prepare the metal nanoparticles without pollution and accordingly the nanocolloids may comprise the conductive metal nanoparticles with a high purity. According to one embodiment, step 2 prepares a mixture by mixing the metal salts and polymers. The metal salts at step 2 may desirably be selected from the group consisting of metal organics, metal nitrides, and metal chlorides and, due to the inclusion of metal compounds, conductive metal atoms can be precipitated from the metal compounds and the precipitated conductive metal atoms fill the gaps between the metal nanoparticles to improve the electric conductivity of the conductive metal film or pattern prepared according to the present invention. The polymers at step 2, as polymers reacted with the metal salts, may desirably be selected from the group consisting of polyvinyl pyrrolidone, ethylene diamine, and diethyleneamine, but not limited thereto. At step 2, a concentration for mixing the metal salts and the polymers may desirably range between 0.01 and 1 mol, and the metal salts and the polymers with the concentration are desired to be added individually to de-mineralized water for mixing. If the metal salts and the polymers are mixed at a concentration less than 0.01 mol, copper atoms may not be precipitated sufficiently and may not fill the gaps between the conductive metal particles included in the nanocolloids, which may decrease the electric conductivity. And if the metal salts and the polymers are mixed at a concentration exceeding 1 mol, a viscosity of the conductive metal ink used for the preparation method according to the present invention may increase, which may not be desirable for printing the conductive metal film or pattern. According to one embodiment, step 3 prepares a metal ink by stirring the metal nanocolloids and the metal salt/polymer mixture prepared at steps 1 and 2. The stirring at step 3 is performed with a device or by a method to disperse completely the metal nanaocolloids and the metal salt/polymer mixture. By stirring at step 3, the conductive metal ink, which may print the conductive film or pattern of the present invention, may be prepared. According to one embodiment, step 4 prints the metal ink prepared at step 3. By printing at step 4, a shape of the conductive metal film or pattern may be formed. Printing at step 4 may be performed by a method selected from the group consisting of gravure printing, offset printing, inkjet printing, screen printing, imprint, and spin coating. Those printing methods, unlike a conventional method for preparing a pattern or film, may prepare a pattern or film through one process for printing an ink. Therefore, the conductive pattern or conductive metal film according to the present invention may be formed by means of one-step process. The printing at step 4 may desirably be performed in a gas atmosphere selected from the group consisting of argon, hydrogen, and air. By printing in the gaseous atmosphere at step 4, the metal film may have an anti-oxidant effect and the processing cost may be reduced by controlling such variables as a sintering temperature and sintering time. According to one embodiment, step 5 treats thermally the conductive metal ink printed at step 4. The thermal treatment may desirably be performed at a temperature of 100 to 500° C. If the thermal treatment is performed at a temperature less than 100° C., residues may remain inside a pattern or film and the adhesion to a substrate may deteriorate. And if the thermal treatment is performed at a temperature exceeding 500° C., the substrate may be damaged or the printed pattern may be shrunk, and economic losses may be incurred due to an excessively high temperature. By means of the thermal treatment within the temperature range, a contact force with the substrate may be desirable and the metal film or pattern whose conductive metal is highly dense may be prepared. Therefore, the metal film or pattern prepared by the methods for preparing the conductive metal film or pattern according to the present invention may be applied to electronic devices used in various fields.
