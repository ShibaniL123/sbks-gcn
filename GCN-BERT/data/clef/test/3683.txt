Example 19: Synthesis of (S)-3-aminoquinuclidine.mono-p-toluenesulfonate
2-propanol solution (22.68 g) containing p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (4.55 g: 23.9 mmol) was charged into a 50 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and 2-propanol solution (10.52 g) containing (S)-3-aminoquinuclidine (3.00 g: 23.8 mmol) was added thereto while stirring at room temperature. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60° C., to obtain (S)-3-aminoquinuclidine.mono-p-toluenesulfonate (6.87 g: 23.0 mmol, yield=97%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 220° C.
