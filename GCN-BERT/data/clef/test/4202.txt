ROLL UP TABLE TENNIS TABLE BACKGROUND TO THE PRESENT INVENTION The present invention relates to a roll up table tennis table and methods of manufacturing the same. Table tennis tables are conventionally made of a rigid material such as wood or concrete. These materials are used as a hard surface is required to allow e.g. a ball to bounce off the surface upon impact. Such table tennis tables are generally too big to be put in an average family home or small social venues, for example a standard table tennis table measures 9 feet (274cm) by 5 feet (152.5cm). In view of the foregoing, it is desirable to provide a table tennis table, and a method of manufacturing the same, with improved convenience. SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a game table comprising a plurality of modules each having a substantially flat top surface, the plurality of modules being coupled together so as to allow one or more of the plurality of modules to be overlapped such that the game table is arranged in a compact form when the game table is not in use, and to allow the plurality of modules to be positioned side by side to form a flat playing surface when the game table is in use. Another aspect of the present invention provides a method of manufacturing a game table comprising providing a plurality of modules each having a substantially flat fop surface, the plurality of modules being coupled together so as to allow one or more of the plurality of modules to be overlapped such that the game table is arranged in a compact form when the game table is not in use, and to allow the plurality of modules to be positioned side by side to form a flat playing surface when the game table is in use. According to preferred embodiments, the plurality of modules of the game table are coupled together such that the game table can be folded up, rolled up or otherwise packed into a compact form for storage. The coupling of the plurality of modules is such that the game table can be easily unfolded, unrolled or unpacked into a predetermined shape and size to form a flat playing surface when the game table is to be used. Preferably the playing surface that is formed of the plurality of modules is configured into a predetermined shape and size that corresponds to the game, for example 9 feet by 5 feet for table tennis. Thus, according to the preferred embodiments, it is possible to provide a game table that can be used on a flat surface such as a kitchen table to convert the flat surface into a playing surface for the game, e.g. table tennis. Moreover, it is possible to reduce the space requirement for storing such a game table when not in use. Preferably, each module of the plurality of modules of the game table comprises a flexible underside. The flexible underside provides additional rigidity to the game table as well as shock absorption, and can moreover prevent sliding between the game table and the surface on which the game table is placed. The flexible underside may be made of any suitable material such as foam, silicone, rubber, etc. The flexible underside may be formed into any desirable shape. For example it may simply be a sheet of material with a predetermined thickness, but in preferred embodiments, the flexible underside of each module extends from one end of the module to the opposite end of the module and has a shaped profile. Preferably the flexible underside has a triangular profile, but other shaped profiles are also possible such as a semi-circular or a rectangular profile. In preferred embodiments, the top surface of each module is formed in a rectangular shape. The plurality of modules may be coupled together in any suitable or desirable way. For example, the plurality of modules may be coupled together by adhering each module to a sheet of flexible material of the predetermined shape and size (e.g. vinyl), or by joining an edge of one module with an edge of an adjacent module using one or more hinges. Preferably, the top surface of each module is formed with the long side of the rectangle equals to the width of the game table, such that each module is positioned alongside an adjacent module and joined, attached, adhered or otherwise coupled along the length of the rectangular top surface. In some embodiments, the plurality of modules are coupled together by one or more cables extending through each module (e.g. through the centre). In an embodiment, each module is provided with a protrusion or tongue along one edge and a corresponding groove along the opposite edge, such that each module is coupled to an adjacent module along the length of the rectangular top surface in a tongue and groove configuration. The tongues and grooves may be in another suitable or desirable corresponding shapes, but in preferred embodiment, the tongues and grooves have a rectangular profile. Optionally, the top surface of each module may be laminated to give the playing surface additional hardness and smoothness. In some embodiments, the game table may further comprise one or more holders provided along a side of the game table for receiving an elongated rod when the game table in use. The one or more holders may be in any suitable or desirable shape and/or sizes. For example a holder may be in the form of a semi-circular open ring on which the elongated rod sits, or a resilient clamp that allows the elongated rod to snap into. In preferred embodiments, a holder is in the form of a ring into which the elongated rod is inserted. Thus, a series of one or more rings may be provided along, for example, the length of the game table, preferably on both sides, through which an elongated rod may be inserted so as to increase the rigidity of the game table when in use. Optionally, the game table comprises the elongated rod. It is however not essential as a user may use any suitable rod, for example a broom handle. Where the elongated rod is provided with the game table, in preferred embodiments, the elongated rod is configured to be foldable at one or more positions along its length, such that when the game table is to be stored away, the elongated rod may be shortened for storage. Optionally, the game table may further comprise a binding means provided at a side of the game table for binding the plurality of overlapping modules so as to retain the game table in the compact form when the game table not in use. Preferably, the binding means is a flexible wrapper made e.g. of fabric, and preferably provided at a short edge of the game table, such that, for example, when the game table is rolled up from the opposite edge, the flexible wrapper may wrap around the rolled up game table to retain the game table in the rolled up form. In preferred embodiments, the binding means, e.g. a flexible wrapper, may be provided with means for securing the binding, e.g. means for attaching to itself such as a Velcro.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT A first embodiment of a game table according to the present invention is shown in Fig. 1, in which a table tennis table configuration is used as an example. According to the present embodiment, when in use, the game table is unrolled or unfolded to provide a playing surface 10 for the game. According to the present embodiment, the playing surface is configured to have a predetermined shape and size suitable for the game. Thus, for example, for table tennis, the length of the playing surface is 9 feet while the width is 5 feet. Other games are also contemplated, in which case the playing surface is configured to a shape and size suitable for the game accordingly. Fig. 2 shows a side view of the game table of the first embodiment along the length of the game table. According to the present embodiment, the game table comprises a plurality of modules 20 arranged side by side. In the present embodiment, each module 20 comprises a rectangular top surface 21 and an underside 22, for example formed of a flexible material such as foam, silicone or rubber. In the present embodiment, the flexible underside 22 has a triangular profile. The plurality of modules are coupled together such that when the game table is in use, the plurality of modules extends into the predetermined shape and size to form the playing surface 10. For example, the plurality of modules may be coupled together by being attached or adhered to a sheet of flexible material of the same shape and size of the playing surface 10. According to the present embodiment, for additional rigidity of the playing surface, the game table is provided with a plurality of holders 24, in this example in the form of a plurality of rings, through which an elongated rod 23 can be inserted to retain the shape of the game table. An under view of the game table of the present embodiment is shown in Fig. 3. As can be seen, the plurality of rings 24 are preferably provided along the length of the game table, and can be provided along each of the two long edges of the game table for receiving the elongated rod 23. An end view from the short edge of the game table is shown in Fig. 4, showing the position of the elongated rods 23 as inserted into the rings 24. An example of an elongated rod 23 suitable for use with the game table of the present embodiment is shown in Figs. 5Α and 5Β. Fig. 5Α shows an extended configuration of the elongated rod 23 which is preferably the same length as the length of the game table. Fig. 5Β shows a folded configuration of the elongated rod 23. In this example, the elongated rod 23 comprises two portions 23-1 and 23-2, coupled together by a cable 52. In use, the two portions 23-1 and 23-2 are held in place together by a holder or cap 51 provided to an end of the portion 23-1 for receiving an end of the portion 23-2. Fig. 6 shows a perspective view of the game table of the present embodiment when in use. In this example of a table tennis table, a net 62 may be mounted to the game table on the playing surface 10. The net may be provided as part of the game table and may be configured to be e.g. collapsible for storage. According to the present embodiment, the game table is further provided with a binding means 61, for example in the form of an outer wrapper, for binding the game table in a compact form when not in use. Fig. 7 shows the game table of the present embodiment being arranged into the compact form. According to the present embodiment, the coupling of the plurality of modules 20 is configured to allow the modules 20 to overlap, such that the game table can be rolled up into the compact form. As can be seen here, the triangular profile of the flexible underside 22 enables the modules to overlap more efficiently and thus result in a more compact rolled up game table. Once rolled up, the binding means 61, e.g. an outer wrapper, can be used to retain the game table in its compact form. In the present example, a Velcro 71 and 72 is provided such that one end of the outer wrapper 61 can be attached to the other end once the outer wrapper 61 is wrapped around the rolled up game table to secure the outer wrapper 61 in place. The game table of the present embodiment in a rolled up configuration is shown in Fig. 8, bound or wrapped up by the binding means 61. A second embodiment of a game table according to the present invention is shown in Fig. 9, which shows a top side of the game table. Again, the game table of the present embodiment comprises a plurality of modules 91. An under view of the game table of the present embodiment is shown in Fig. 10. In the present embodiment, the game table is provided with one or more reinforce wire 101 to give additional rigidity to the game table. A side view along the length of the game table of the present embodiment is shown in Fig. 11. The plurality of modules 91 forms a playing surface 111. The plurality of modules 91 according to the present embodiment are coupled together by a cable 113 that extends through the centre of the plurality of modules to the opposite (short) edges of the game table. The cable 113 is tightened and released by a lever lock 112, such that when the lever lock 112 is in a locked position, the cable 113 is tightened to secure the plurality of modules 91 to provide a rigid playing surface 111, and when the lever lock 112 is released, the cable 113 is relaxed to allow the plurality of modules to overlap (and thus the game table rolled up). Fig. 12 shows an end view along the width of the game table of the present embodiment. In this example, two cables 113 are provided spaced apart from each other along the length of the game table, and each cable is provided with a respective pair of lever lock 112. Fig. 13 shows the coupling of the modules 91 in more detail. In the present embodiment, each module 91 is provided with a through hole 130 through which the cable 113 is threaded. According to the present embodiment, one of the two long edges of a module 91 is shaped with a groove along its length while the other one of the two long edges is shaped with a protrusion or tongue to be fitted within the groove of an adjacent module 91, such that the plurality of module, when the game table is in use, are locked into position by corresponding tongues and grooves, secured by putting the lever lock 112 in the lock position. Although the tongue and groove configuration is shown with a rectangular profile in the present embodiment, it is contemplated that other corresponding shapes may be used, such as curved or triangular shapes. Although the present invention has been described with reference to a table tennis table, other types of game tables have been contemplated.
