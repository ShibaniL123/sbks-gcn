Step 6-1-1: Preparation of tert-butyl (S)-2-((3-chloro-2-(phenylcarbamoyl)-1H-pyrrole-1-yl)carbamoyl)pyrrolidine-1- carboxylate(7a)
1-amino-3-chloro-N-phenyl-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxamide(6a) (150 mg, 0.64 mmol), N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-L-proline (192 mg, 0.89 mmol), and EDC.HCl (171 mg, 0.89 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous THF (1 ml), followed by reaction at room temperature for 20 hours. The reaction mixture was extracted by using ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated brine, separated, dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate, 5/1) to give 193 mg of the target compound tert-butyl (S)-2-((3-chloro-2-(phenylcarbamoyl)-1H-pyrrole-1-yl)carbamoyl)pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate(7a) as a white solid (0.45 mmol, yield: 70%).
