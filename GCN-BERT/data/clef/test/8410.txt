Example 4
Synthesis of (R)-1-(2-(methylthio)-8-(((S)-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl)amino)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)ethyl benzoate
A mixture of (R)-1-(8-chloro-2-(methylthio)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)ethyl benzoate synthesized by the process described in Example 3 (360 mg, 1.0 mmol), (S)-tetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-amine hydrochloride (206 mg, 1.5 mmol), and potassium carbonate (415 mg, 3.0 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (4.0 mL) was stirred at 100Â°C overnight. The reaction was monitored by TLC. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. The reaction mixture was diluted with water, and the mixture was extracted twice with ethyl acetate (10 mL). The resultant organic phase was washed with brine and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solid was separated by filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resultant crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography to yield the title compound (232 mg, 55%).
