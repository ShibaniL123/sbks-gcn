BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The invention concerns recombinant antibodies binding to prostate-specific stem cell antigen (PSCA) and their use in diagnostics and therapy. The antibodies are suitable for use in the field of medicine, pharmacy and biomedical research. Prostate carcinoma is one of the most frequent cancer-related causes of death in Germany. The standard therapy for a primary, organ-limited prostate carcinoma is currently radical prostatectomy, i.e. the complete removal of the prostate, seminal vesicles, and lymph nodes. An alternative to this is radiotherapy which is done by spiking the prostate with radioactive material (brachytherapy). Most patients with primary, local prostate carcinoma can be treated successfully by radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy. A relapse occurs in about 20-40% of the affected persons [Roehl 2004]. Presently, different antibody-based therapy procedures are being developed. In this context, it is of essential importance to identify target structures on the cancer cells which can serve as sites of attack for the antibody-based therapeutics. A suitable target structure as an attack site for the treatment of prostate cancer are surface proteins which are present primarily in the prostate tissue and which exhibit overexpression in malignant cells in comparison to healthy cells. The prostate-specific stem cell antigen (PSCA) is such a surface molecule which is present specifically on prostate cells and is expressed at a higher rate in prostate carcinoma cells in comparison to healthy tissue (tumor-associated antigen). Human PSCA comprises 123 amino acids and has an N-terminal signal sequence, a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchoring sequence and several N-glycosylation sites. PSCA is included in the Thy-1/Ly-6 family of the GPI-anchored cell surface molecules because, inter alia, it has the characteristic preserved cysteine residues of this family [Reiter 1998]. On account of the increased expression in prostate tumors, PSCA is a suitable target molecule for the therapy of prostate cancer and, up to now, different therapy strategies which are aimed at PSCA as a target have been developed. Evidence of the efficacy of PSCA as a therapeutic target in cancer therapy on human subjects has been produced, inter alia, by vaccination with dendritic cells which were loaded before with a PSCA peptide. Clinical studies (phase 1 and 2) with 12 hormone-refractory and chemotherapy-refractory prostate cancer patients have demonstrated that a vaccination with PSCA peptide-loaded dendritic cells caused a T-cell response against PSCA which correlated on average with an extended survival rate in five of the patients. In one patient even a reduction of the tumor mass was observed [Thomas-Kaskel 2006]. WO 2009/032949 A2 discloses monoclonal anti-PSCA antibodies (1G8) which are used for targeting tumors and for their detection. The CDR regions of the antibodies have the following amino acid sequences: variable region of the light chain variable region of the (1G8) heavy chain (1G8) CDR1 SASSSVRFIHW SEQ ID DYYIHW SEQ ID No. 69 No. 72 CDR2 DTSKLAS SEQ ID WIDPENGDTEFVPKFQG SEQ ID No. 70 No. 73 CDR3 QQWSSSPFT SEQ ID TGGF SEQ ID No. 71 No. 74 On account of the cytotoxic properties of the 1G8 antibody, the latter is unsuited for targeting strategies which are based on the recruitment of effector cells (Gu 2005). The antibodies disclosed in WO 2009/032949 A2 are used diagnostically preferably in the form of functional murine and humanized monoclonal antibodies as well as PSCA-specific minibodies and diabodies marked with radionuclides. [Feldmann 2010] have developed bispecific recombinant antibodies with a PSCA-binding paratope and a CD3-binding paratope. The PSCA-binding paratope of the bispecific antibodies is derived from the PSCA antibody 7F5 [Morgenroth 2007] and comprises CDR regions with the following amino acid sequences: variable region of the light chain variable region of the (7F5) heavy chain (7F5) CDR1 RTSQDISNYLN SEQ ID SYTMS SEQ ID No. 27 No. 30 CDR2 YTLKLNS SEQ ID YIHNGGGHTYYPDTIKG SEQ ID No. 28 No. 31 CDR3 QQSKTLPWT SEQ ID RMYYGNSHWYFDV SEQ ID No. 29 No. 32 The bispecific antibodies disclosed in [Feldmann 2010] in vitro successfully caused the specific T-cell mediated lysis of PSCA-positive tumor cells. For a specific lysis of about 40% of the employed PSCA-positive tumor cells, for a ratio of effector cells to PSCA-positive tumor cells of 20:1 at least 5 ng of the bispecific antibody disclosed in [Feldmann 2010] is to be used. In vitro, a specific lysis of maximally about 60% of the employed PSCA-positive tumor cells (in the presence of 50-100 ng of the antibody) has been achieved with the antibodies disclosed in [Feldmann 2010]. A further increase of the effectiveness could not be proved. Even in the presence of 1,000 ng of the bispecific antibody, a higher proportion of PSCA-positive tumor cells could not be lysed. The known in vitro and in vivo data show that PSCA has a great potential as a target antigen for the immunotherapy of prostate carcinomas and is suitable as a diagnostic target. The object of the invention is to provide improved antibodies against PSCA which are therapeutically effective in particular in the form of bispecific recombinant antibodies in low concentration and are able to lyse PSCA-positive tumor cells effectively. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object is solved according to the invention by an antibody binding to prostate-specific stem cell antigen (PSCA) (herein also referred to as anti-PSCA antibody) which contains complementarity determining regions (CDR) with the following amino acid sequences: CDR of the variable region of the light chain: CDR1 SEQ ID No. 1, CDR2 SEQ ID No. 2, CDR3 SEQ ID No. 3, andCDR of the variable region of the heavy chain: CDR1 SEQ ID No. 4, CDR2 SEQ ID No. 5, CDR3 SEQ ID No. 6. The antibody according to the invention which is characterized by the aforementioned CDRs is also referred to herein simply as MB1. The inventors have unexpectedly found within the scope of extensive research that the antibody according to the invention in the form of recombinant bispecific antibodies can mediate even in very small quantities the specific lysis of PSCA-positive tumor cells. Further, it was found unexpectedly that the specific lysis of PSCA-positive tumor cells mediated by the new antibodies is more effective. Thus, in in vitro tests with bispecific antibodies containing an anti-PSCA antibody according to the invention, more than 90% of the employed PSCA-positive tumor cells were lysed. With the new anti-PSCA antibody the employed antibody amount can thus be reduced significantly. At the same time, the therapeutic efficacy is raised because with the antibody according to the invention PSCA-positive tumor cells can be more effectively lysed. On account of the low concentration with which an efficacy can be achieved with the antibody according to the invention, an improved killing of metastasized PSCA-positive cells is also possible with the antibody according to the invention. Comparative tests with prior art anti-PSCA 7F5 in a comparable bispecific construct clearly confirmed the superiority of the antibody according to the invention in in vitro (FIG. 3) as well as in vivo studies (FIG. 4). Preferred anti-PSCA antibodies according to the invention contain CDR regions as defined above wherein the amino acid sequence of the variable regions of the light and heavy chain have amino acid sequence identity of at least 80%, preferably at least 90%, particularly preferred at least 95%, relative to the following amino acid sequence: variable region of the light chain SEQ ID No. 24, variable region of the heavy chain SEQ ID No. 26, orvariable region of the light chain SEQ ID No. 20, variable region of the heavy chain SEQ ID No. 22. Of these, anti-PSCA antibodies with the CDR regions as defined above whose variable regions have a humanized structure are preferred. Particularly preferred are anti-PSCA antibodies whose variable region of the light chain contains the amino acid sequence according to SEQ ID No. 24 and whose variable region of the heavy chain contains the amino acid sequence according to SEQ ID No. 26. The term “antibody” in the meaning of the invention encompasses all antibodies or antibody fragments which are able to bind specifically to an antigen. In case of recombinant antibodies, these are antibodies which are produced with the aid of genetically modified organisms. The term antibody encompasses the complete monoclonal antibodies as well as their epitope-binding fragments. In this context, the epitope-binding fragments (herein also referred to as antibody fragments) comprise those parts of the antibody which are able to bind to the antigen. Antibody fragments in the meaning of the invention encompass Fab, Fab′, fa(ab′)2, Fd, single chains (single-chain) variable fragments (scFv), single chain antibodies, disulfide-linked variable fragments (sdFv), and fragments that contain either a variable region of the light chain (VL) or a variable region of the heavy chain (VH). Antibody fragments contain the variable regions either alone or in combination with other regions which are selected from the hinge region and the first, second, and third region of the constant region (CH1, CH2, CH3). Furthermore, the term antibody encompasses recombinant antibodies, like diabodies, triabodies, and tetrabodies. Also encompassed by the term antibody are chimeric antibodies in which different parts of the antibody originate from different species, for example, antibodies with a murine variable region which is combined with a human constant region. Humanized antibodies are also encompassed by the term antibody. The goal of humanization of antibodies is the reduction of the immunogenity of a xenogeneic antibody, for example murine antibodies, for use in the human system wherein the full binding affinity and the antigen specificity are preserved. Humanized antibodies can be produced by different known ways, for example, by resurfacing and CDR grafting. In resurfacing, all non-CDR regions on the surface of the antibody are modified by a combination of molecular modelling, statistical analyses, and mutagenesis so that they resemble the surface of antibodies of the target organism. With CDR grafting the CDR regions of the antibody to be humanized are introduced into human variable regions. Antibody fragments are linked together if necessary by a linker. The linker comprises a short peptide sequence (preferably with a length of 10 to 50 amino acid residues) which is selected such that the antibody fragment has such a three-dimensional folding structure of the VL and VH that it has the antigen specificity of the complete antibody. Glycine serine linkers or linker peptides with an amino acid sequence according to SEQ ID No. 75 or SEQ ID No. 76 are preferred. The term “variable region” means herein the parts of the heavy and light chains of the antibodies which differ between antibodies in their sequence and determine the specificity of the antibody and binding to its antigen. In this context, the variability is not distributed evenly in the variable region but is usually concentrated within three defined segments of the variable region, the complementarity determining regions (CDRs, also referred to as hypervariable regions) which are contained in the variable regions of the light chain as well as the heavy chain. The antigen binding site of an antibody, the so-called paratope, is characterized by the hypervariable regions (CDR) of the light and heavy chains of the antibody. For describing antibodies the simplified name anti-“antigen” antibody is also used herein to show that this is an antibody which binds specifically to the antigen defined in the name. For example, an “anti-PSCA” antibody in the meaning of the invention is to be understood as an antibody which binds specifically to the antigen PSCA. A specific binding of an antibody to a specific antigen is to be understood herein such that an antibody with a high affinity binds to the specific antigen and binds with a distinctly lower affinity, and preferably does not bind, to other antigens. Preferred antibodies are present in the form of a scFv fragment or a F(ab′)2 fragment. Further preferred antibodies are bispecific antibodies which are produced recombinantly and which contain two different paratopes with one directed against PSCA and the other not directed against PSCA. The other paratope of the bispecific antibody is preferably directed against a surface structure on an effector cell or against a peptide of a length of 10 to 50 amino acids (preferably a sequence of the human La protein of a length of 10 to 50 amino acids, particularly preferred against a peptide with one of the amino acid sequences according to SEQ ID No. 75 or SEQ ID No. 76). Anti-PSCA antibodies according to the invention (naive or recombinant antibodies) with a conjugated effector group are preferred. Conjugation means, in this context, coupling of a substance, here the effector group, to the antibody. The bond of the antibody with the effector group is produced preferably by recombinant expression in the form of a fusion protein or by in vitro methods wherein the effector group is preferably bonded by chemical linker groups to the antibody (for example, by thioether bonds or disulfide bonds). They can be bonded to the antibody also by an intermediary carrier molecule, for example, serum albumin. If necessary, an antibody according to the invention contains several effector groups. In this context, effector groups are preferably selected from active ingredients, peptides (with a length of 10 to 100 amino acids), proteins (with a length of more than 100 amino acids), co-stimulating molecules, dyes or contrast media. Preferred anti-PSCA antibodies according to the invention are conjugated with active ingredients, i.e., with pharmaceutically effective substances. Preferred active ingredients encompass toxins, preferably cytostatic agents; of these, preferably selected are: maytansinoids and maytansinoid analogs, taxoids, CC-1065 and CC-1065 analogs, dolastatin and dolastatin analogs, methotrexate, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, vincristine, vinblastin, melphalan, mitomycin C, chlorambucil and calicheamicin. Further preferred anti-PSCA antibodies according to the invention are conjugated with contrast media. Preferred contrast media are radionuclides; of these, preferred are the radioactive isotopes of technetium, rhenium, yttrium, copper, gallium, indium, bismuth and platinum, in particular 99mTc, 90Y, 186Re, 188Re, 68Ga, and 111In.

Further preferred anti-PSCA antibodies according to the invention are conjugated with a dye, preferably a fluorescent dye. Further preferred antibodies according to the invention are conjugated with a peptide which contains a binding region to which an antibody specific for the peptide binds specifically. Preferably, the peptide comprises a peptide sequence of a length of 10 to 50 amino acids of an alpha-helical region of the human La protein (the amino acid sequence of the human La protein corresponds to SEQ ID No. 77). Particularly preferred are peptides with an amino acid sequence identity of at least 90%, preferably at least 95%, particularly preferred at least 99%, relative to one of the amino acid sequences according to SEQ ID No. 75 or SEQ ID No. 76. It is particularly preferred to produce anti-PSCA antibodies according to the invention by recombination. Preferably, recombinant anti-PSCA antibodies according to the invention contain at least two different binding units, wherein at least one of the binding units specifically binds to PSCA and contains the paratope of the anti-PSCA antibody according to the invention, andat least one other one of the binding units binds specifically to an antigen other than PSCA, preferably to a surface structure on an effector cell. The PSCA-binding binding unit comprises therefore an anti-PSCA antibody according to the invention and contains therefore at least the following CDR regions: CDR of the variable region of the light chain comprising the following amino acid sequences: CDR1 SEQ ID No. 1, CDR2 SEQ ID No. 2, CDR3 SEQ ID No. 3, andCDR of the variable region of the heavy chain comprising the following, amino acid sequences: CDR1 SEQ ID No. 4, CDR2 SEQ ID No. 5, CDR3 SEQ ID No. 6 The term “binding unit” in the meaning of the invention refers to any molecular structure which specifically binds defined substances or structures. Depending on the substance or structure to be bonded, the binding unit has different structures. Hence, the term “binding unit” in the meaning of the invention encompasses therefore antibodies (in this case the binding unit contains at least the functional paratope of the antibody) as well as other molecules, preferably proteins which form a specific binding with an antigen. Such molecules are preferably ligands which bind specifically to a surface structure (for example, a surface receptor) on a cell, in particular on an effector cell. Preferred binding units which are included in antibodies according to the invention bind specifically to an effector cell. The definition of effector cells in the meaning of the invention encompasses all cells of the native and adaptive immune system which provide immune responses or are involved actively therein. Preferably, the effector cell is selected from T lymphocytes, NK cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and granulocytes. Particularly preferred are binding units which bind against surface structures on T lymphocytes. When a recombinant antibody according to the invention contains at least two different antibodies (at least one anti-PSCA antibody according to the invention and at least one other antibody which does not bind specifically to PSCA), it is preferably in the form of a diabody, triabody or tetrabody. Preferred are bispecific antibodies from single chain antibodies (single chain bispecific diabody, scBsDb) or bispecific tandem antibodies from single chain antibodies (single chain bispecific tandem antibody, scBsTaFv). It is particularly preferred that a recombinant antibody according to the invention is present in the form of an scBsTaFv. Preferred antibodies that do not bind to PSCA-binding antibodies which are contained in a recombinant antibody according to the invention (in this case the recombinant antibody is a bispecific antibody) are antibodies which bind specifically to a surface structure of an effector cell. In this case the binding unit that does not bind to PSCA contains at least the paratope of the antibody which binds to a surface structure of an effector cell. It is particularly preferred that the antibodies are directed against the following surface structures on effector cells: CD3, CD8, CD4, CD25, CD28, CD16, NKG2D, NKp46, NKp44, activating KIR receptors (activating killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors). Particularly preferred are antibodies which are directed against CD3 (anti-CD3 antibody), wherein the anti-CD3 antibody contains CDR regions with the following amino acid sequences: CDR of the variable region of the heavy chain: CDR1 SEQ ID No. 66, CDR2 SEQ ID No. 67, CDR3 SEQ ID No. 68, andCDR of the variable region of the light chain: CDR1 SEQ ID No. 58, CDR2 SEQ ID No. 59, CDR3 SEQ ID No. 60. Further preferred are recombinant anti-PSCA antibodies which contain at least two different binding units wherein at least one other one of the binding units is a ligand (preferably a protein or a glycan) which binds specifically to a surface structure on an effector cell. Preferred ligands influence the activity of the effector cells by their binding to the (effector) cell surface. In this context, the ligand is selected such that that it binds specifically to surface structures of effector cells and, by the binding action, triggers signal cascades for activation of the effector cells. Preferred as a ligand is a protein structure or a glycan which binds specifically to a receptor which is expressed specifically on the surface of effector cells, wherein the ligand causes, due to its binding action, at the receptors an activation of the effector cell. It is particularly preferred that the protein structures are selected from ULB-Ps (e.g. ULB-P2), MICA, MICB, and cytokines (for example IL2 and IL15). Antibodies according to the invention, in particular recombinant antibodies according to the invention, are suited for specifically binding to PSCA-positive cells in vivo and in vitro. Hence, the invention also encompasses the use of the anti-PSCA antibodies according to the invention as a medicament, in particular for the treatment of tumor diseases, prostate cancer, or as a diagnostic agent. The invention encompasses further the antibodies according to the invention for the therapy of tumor diseases, in particular prostate cancer.

The term “nucleic acids” in the meaning of the invention encompasses in addition to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acids (RNA) also all the other linear polymers in which the bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T) or uracil (U) are arranged in a suitable sequence (nucleic acid sequence). The invention thus also encompasses the corresponding RNA sequences (in which thymine is replaced with uracil), complementary sequences, and sequences with modified nucleic acid backbone or 3′ or 5′ terminus. In this context, the term “nucleic acid sequences with modified backbone” encompasses all other linear polymers in which the bases adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T) or uracil (U) are arranged in suitable sequence, such as e.g. sequences with phosphothioate, phosphoamidate or O-methyl-derivatized backbone, peptide nucleic acids (PNA), and locked nucleic acids (LNA), or mixed backbone. In this context, the term “modified 3′ or terminus” encompasses modifications which serve for stabilization as well as binding of markers. Examples of marker are enzymes, dyes or fluorescent dyes, radionucleotides, as well as haptenes, as e.g. digoxigenin or biotin. The invention also encompasses a vector (also: “expression vector”) which contains a nucleic acid according to the invention. In the meaning of the invention, an expression vector is understood as a plasmid, virus or other carrier containing a nucleic acid sequence according to the invention by recombination through insertion or incorporation. The expression vector contains typically a replication starting point, a promoter, as well as specific gene sequences which allow a phenotype selection of host cells containing the expression vector. The invention encompasses further a host cell or a non-human host organism containing a nucleotide sequence according to the invention or a vector according to the invention. In this context, the nucleotide sequence or the vector are contained recombinantly in the host cell or the non-human host organism. A host cell in the meaning of the invention is a naturally occurring cell or a transformed or genetically modified cell line which contains at least one vector according to the invention. The invention encompasses in this context transient transfectants (e.g., by mRNA injection) or host cells in which at least one expression vector according to the invention is included as a plasmid or artificial chromosome, as well as host cells in which an expression vector according to the invention is integrated stably into the genome of the host. The host cell is selected preferably from cells of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Human embryonic stem cells which were obtained by destroying embryos are no host cells in the meaning of the invention. Preferred prokaryote cells are selected from cells of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Preferred eukaryote cells are selected from yeast cells (preferably Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Pichia pastoris), insect cells, amphibious cells and mammalian cells (preferably CHO, HeLa, HEK293). Non-human host organisms contain a vector according to the invention which is integrated stably into the genome of the host organism or individual cells of the host organism. Preferred host organisms are plants, invertebrates or vertebrates, in particular Bovidae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Xenopus laevis, medaka, zebra fish or Mus musculus, or cells or embryos of the named organisms. The invention provides anti-PSCA antibodies and corresponding expression systems with which human PSCA can be bound more effectively. In this way, the anti-PSCA antibody according to the invention is suitable particularly for the application in therapy systems with which killing of tumor cells can be mediated by recruitment of effector cells. On account of the higher affinity of the antibodies according to the invention to PSCA, a substantially smaller quantity of antibodies is necessary for binding (for example, in therapeutic use). It has been demonstrated that the anti-PSCA antibody according to the invention can mediate the specific lysis of PSCA-positive tumor cells in clearly lower concentrations and with clearly higher efficiency. This has, on the one hand, cost advantages because the antibody consumption can be reduced. On the other hand, in the therapeutic use an improved targeting primarily also of metastasized cells is to be expected as well as fewer side effects due to lower administration quantities.

PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Example 1 Preparation of Bispecific Recombinant Antibodies (scBsTaFv) which Bind Specifically to PSCA (Direct Targeting) For use in targeting PSCA+ cells, a bispecific antibody (single chain bispecific diabody, scBsTaFv) was prepared which binds with one binding unit to PSCA and with the other binding unit to CD3. The bispecific antibody is called herein also simply CD3-PSCA(MB1) and is schematically shown in FIG. 1A. The PSCA-binding domain contains the variable region of the anti-PSCA MB1 antibody according to the invention (murine anti-PSCA antibody: heavy chain SEQ ID No. 22, light chain SEQ ID No. 20; humanized anti-PSCA antibody: heavy chain SEQ ID No. 26, light chain SEQ ID No. 24). It serves for binding to the PSCA-positive tumor cells. The other domain binds to CD3, a component of T cell receptor complex, and serves for activation of T cells. This enables the recruitment of T of cells to the PSCA-positive cells and mediates in this manner the specific lysis of the PSCA-positive cells by the T cells. For the generation of the monoclonal anti-PSCA MB1 antibodies, H-2d positive C3Hx Balb/C F1 mice were immunized with P815 cells, the PSCA recombinantly expressed on the surface. By fusion of spleen cells and myeloma cells, hybridoma cells were generated that secrete monoclonal anti-PSCA antibodies. After single cloning of these hybridoma cells, it was possible to select the clone MB1. For generating recombinant anti-PSCA MB1 antibodies the nucleic acid sequences of the variable domain of the heavy (VH) and light (VL) antibody chain were identified. For this purpose, first mRNA was isolated from the hybridoma cells secreting anti-PSCA MB1 and transcribed to cDNA. Afterwards the variable domain of the heavy chain of the isotype IgG1 was amplified with degenerated primers (primer pair SEQ ID No. 90 and 91) as well as the variable domain light κ chain with the aid of degenerated primers (primer pair SEQ ID No. 92 and 93). The PCR products were subcloned in the vector pGEM T-easy and sequenced. For cloning the murine single chain fragments (scFv) of the anti-PSCA MB1 antibody (herein simply referred to as “scFv MB1”), in which the variable region of the heavy chain is linked by three glycine-serine linkers (G4S, SEQ ID No. 131) with the variable region of the light chain, the nucleic acid sequence of the variable region of the heavy chain of the anti-PSCA MB1 antibody was amplified with the aid of the primer pair according to SEQ ID No. 94 and 95. The nucleic acid sequence of the variable region of the light chain of the anti-PSCA MB1 antibody was amplified with the aid of the primer pair according to SEQ ID No. 96 and 97. The amplified nucleic acids were fused by means of overlap PCR to scFv PSCA MB1 and were cloned via SfiI and NotI in the eukaryotic expression vector pSecTag2B (the expression vector is referred to herein also as “pSecTag2B_scFv MB1 murine”). For cloning the bispecific tandem antibody (scBsTaFv) which is directed against PSCA and CD3 and which contains the CDR regions of the murine MB1 antibody, the nucleic acid sequence of a murine anti-CD3 scFv was amplified with a primer pair according to SEQ ID No. 98 and 99 and via or ApaI 3′-terminally cloned from the murine scFv MB1 into the previously produced expression vector “pSecTag2B_scFv MB1 murine” so that the vector “pSecTag2B_scBsTaFv PSCA (MB1)-CD3 murine” was generated. For cloning the bispecific tandem antibody (scBsTaFv) which is directed against PSCA and CD3 and which contains the CDR regions of the humanized MB1 antibody, the framework regions (FWR) of the PSCA MB1 and CD3 antibodies were humanized. For this purpose, the FWR of the variable murine antibody domains were replaced with the human FWR sequences of highly homologous human IgG1. In addition, the humanized antibody sequences were optimized concerning their expression and secretion by human cell lines. For the humanization of the murine scFv CD3 or scFv MB1 first the humanized VH and VL sequences were amplified individually as described above and were joined afterwards by PCR. The humanization of the VH or VL sequence occurred through the agglomeration of overlapping oligonucleotides and subsequent amplification of the humanized VH or VL nucleic acid sequence. In order to be able to ascertain the sequences of the overlapping oligonucleotides, first the murine VH or VL sequence was compared against a human IgG database (NCBI IgBlast), the human IgG which provided the greatest homology was identified, and then finally the humanized VH or VL sequence was theoretically created, and the overlapping oligonucleotides synthesized. Different bispecific antibodies were constructed in which linker peptides of different length were used. Humanization of the Anti-CD3 Antibody For the humanization of the variable region of the heavy chain of the anti-CD3 antibody, oligonucleotides according to SEQ ID No. 100 to 105 were agglomerated. Afterwards the humanized nucleic acid sequence of the variable region of the heavy chain of the anti-CD3 antibody (with a G4S linker peptide, SEQ ID No. 132) was amplified with the aid of the primer pair according to SEQ ID No 105 and 106. For the humanization of the variable region of the light chain of the anti-CD3 antibody, oligonucleotides according to SEQ ID No. 107 to 112 were agglomerated. The humanized nucleic acid sequence of the variable region of the light chain of the anti-CD3 antibody was amplified with the primer pair according to SEQ ID No. 112 and 113. For generating the humanized scFv of the anti-CD3 antibody in which the variable region of the heavy chain is linked by one glycine-serine linker (G4S) with the variable region of the light chain, the humanized nucleic acid sequence of the variable region of the heavy chain of the anti-CD3 antibody was first cloned via SfiI and BamHI into the expression vector pSecTag2B and afterwards via. BamHI and NotI the humanized nucleic acid sequence of the variable region of the light chain of the anti-CD3 antibody was inserted downstream thereof into the same expression vector. For generating the humanized scFv of the anti-CD3 antibody in which the variable region of the heavy chain is linked by three glycine-serine linkers (G4S) with the variable region of the light chain, the humanized nucleic acid sequence of the variable region of the heavy chain of the anti-CD3 antibody was prepared with three glycine-serine linkers (G4S). For this purpose, the humanized nucleic acid sequence of the variable region of the heavy chain of the anti-CD3 antibody (with three G4S linker peptides) was amplified with the aid of the primer pair according to SEQ ID No. 105 and 114 and via SfiI and BamHI cloned into the expression vector pSecTag2B and afterwards via BamHI and NotI the humanized nucleic acid sequence of the variable region of the light chain of the anti-CD3 antibody was inserted downstream thereof into the same expression vector. Humanization of the Anti-PSCA MB1 Antibody For the humanization of the variable region of the light chain of the anti-PSCA MB1 antibody, oligonucleotides according to SEQ ID No. 115 to 118 were agglomerated. The humanized nucleic acid sequence of the variable region of the light chain of the anti-PSCA MB1 antibody was amplified with the primer pair according to SEQ ID No. 119 and 120. For humanization of the variable region of the heavy chain of the anti-PSCA MB1 antibody, oligonucleotides according to SEQ ID No. 121 to 125 were agglomerated. The humanized nucleic acid sequence of the variable region of the heavy chain of the anti-PSCA MB1 antibody was amplified with the primer pair according to SEQ ID No. 126 and 127. Preparation of the Bispecific Humanized Antibody scBsTaFv CD3-PSCA(MB1) Finally, the humanized nucleic acid sequences of the variable region of the heavy chain and the variable region of the light chain of the MB1 antibody were agglomerated and amplified by means of overlap PCR using the primers according to SEQ ID No. 128 and 129. The so generated nucleic acid sequence coding for the humanized scFv MB1 (in the organization VL-G4SG4SGASAAG4SG4S-VH, linker peptide according to SEQ ID No. 130) was cloned via XhoI and ApaI downstream from the afore described humanized scFv of the anti-CD3 antibody (with three G4S linker peptides) whereby the expression vector “pSecTag2B_scBsTaFv PSCA(MB1)-CD3 human” was generated. For expressing the bispecific humanized antibody according to FIG. 1 A, Hek293T cells were transfected with the expression vector and the secreted antibodies were purified from the cell culture supernatant by means of nickel-affinity chromatography, if necessary in combination with a fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation. FIG. 2, lane 5, shows SDS gel electrophoresis image of the purified bispecific antibody.

The paratope directed against CD3 comprises the following amino acid sequences of the variable regions: heavy chain SEQ ID No. 65, light chain SEQ ID No. 57. The paratope directed against the peptide according to SEQ ID No. 75 comprises the following amino acid sequences of the hypervariable regions of the variable regions: light chain CDR1 SEQ ID No. 78, CDR2 SEQ ID No. 79, CDR3 SEQ ID No. 80, heavy chain CDR1 SEQ ID No. 81, CDR2 SEQ ID No. 82, CDR3 SEQ ID No 83. This antibody is named in the following scBsTaFv CD3-5B9. Two different scBsTaFv CD3-5B9 were prepared which merely differ relative to each other in the linker peptide between VH and VL of the anti-CD3 antibody (see FIG. 1B). Cloning of the Humanized scFv PSCA(MB1)-E5B9: For generating the humanized scFv PSCA(MB1) with E5B9 epitope at the C terminus (MB1 [VL-G4SG4SGASAAG4SG4S-MB1 VH]-[G4S-E5B9], shown in FIG. 1B at the bottom), the humanized scFv PSCA (MB1 (VL-G4SG4SGASAAG4SG4S-MB1 MB1 VH-G4S, linker peptide according to SEQ ID No. 130 and 132) described in example 1 was amplified by means of the primers according to SEQ ID No. 134 and 135 and afterwards via SfiI and NotI cloned in pSecTag2B. After agglomeration of the oligonucleotides according to SEQ ID No. 136 and 137, the nucleic acid sequence for E5B9 was cloned via NotI and XhoI at the 3′ end of the humanized scFv PSCA (MB1), whereby the construct “pSecTag2B_scFv PSCA (MB1)-E5B9 humanized” was generated. Cloning of Two Effector Modules “scBsTaFv CD3 (G4S)-5B9” and “scBsTaFv CD3 (3×G4S)-5B9” that are Binding to T Cells and to the E5B9 Peptide As schematically shown in FIG. 1B, for building the modular targeting system I comprising scFv PSCA(MB1)-5B9 two so-called effector modules (bispecific antibodies scBsTaFv CD3-5B9) were produced which differ in the number of the glycine-serine (G4S) elements of the linker peptide between the VH and VL chains of the anti-CD3 domain and therefore were named “scBsTaFv CD3(G4S)-5B9” or, “scBsTaFv CD3(3×G4S)-5B9”. Cloning of “scBsTaFv CD3(G4S)-5B9” Humanized (See Schematic FIG. 1B at the Top): For the humanization of the variable region of the heavy chain of the 5B9 antibody (specifically directed against the peptide E5B9), oligonucleotides according to SEQ ID No. 138 to 142 were agglomerated. Afterwards the humanized nucleic acid sequence of the variable region of the heavy chain of the 5B9 antibody (with a G4S linker peptide, SEQ ID No. 132) was amplified with the aid of the primer pair according to SEQ ID No. 143 and 144. For the humanization of the variable region of the light chain of the 5B9 antibody oligonucleotides according to SEQ ID No. 145 to 149 were agglomerated. The humanized nucleic acid sequence of the variable region of the light chain of the 5B9 antibody was amplified with the primer pair according to SEQ ID No 150 and 151.Finally, the humanized nucleic acid sequences for 5B9 VH and 5B9 VL were agglomerated and amplified by means of overlap PCR using the primers according to SEQ ID No. 152 and 153. The thus generated nucleic acid sequence for the humanized scFv 5B9 (VH-3×G4S-VL) was cloned humanized via XhoI and ApaI downstream of the humanized scFv CD3 VH-G4S-VL in the “pSecTag2B_scFv CD3 VH-G4S-VL”, whereby the vector “pSecTag2B_scBsTaFv CD3(G4S)-5B9 humanized” was generated. Cloning of the “scBsTaFv CD3 (3×G4S)-5B9” Humanized (See Schematic FIG. 1B, at the Middle): The humanized sequence for scFv 5B9 (VH-3×G4S-VL) was cloned humanized via XhoI and ApaI downstream of humanized scFv CD3 (VH-3×G4S-VL) in “pSecTag2B_scFv CD3 VH-3×G4S-VL” whereby the vector “pSecTag2B_scBsTaFv CD3(3×G4S)-5B9 humanized” was generated. For providing a pharmaceutical composition according to the invention (“modular targeting system 2”, schematically shown in FIG. 1C), the following recombinant antibodies were produced: recombinant anti-PSCA antibody according to the invention containing a peptide according to SEQ ID No. 76 (herein also referred to as “E7B6”). This antibody is named in the following scFv PSCA(MB1)-E7B6.bispecific antibody (scBsTaFv) directed against CD3 and the peptide according to SEQ ID No. 76. The paratope directed against CD3 comprises the following amino acid sequences of the variable regions: heavy chain SEQ ID No. 65, light chain SEQ ID No. 57. The paratope directed against the peptide according to SEQ ID No. 76 comprises the following amino acid sequences of the hypervariable regions of the variable regions: light chain CDR1 SEQ ID No 84. CDR2 SEQ ID No. 85, CDR3 SEQ ID No. 86, heavy chain CDR1 SEQ ID No. 87, CDR2 SEQ ID No. 88, CDR3 SEQ ID No 89. This antibody is named in the following scBsTaFv CD3-7B6. Cloning of the Humanized scFv PSCA(MB1)-E7B6: For generating the humanized scFv PSCA(MB1) with E7B6 epitope at the C terminus MB1 [VL-G4SG4SGASAAG4SG4S-MB1 VH]-[G4S-E7B6], shown in FIG. 1C at the bottom), first the agglomeration of the oligonucleotides according to SEQ ID No. 154 and 155 and afterwards cloning of the E7B6 nucleic acid sequence via NotI and XhoI at the 3′ end in “pSecTag2B_scFv PSCA(MB1) humanized” (VL-G4SG4SGASAAG4SG4S-VH-G4S, in analogy to the described construct above with the E5B9 peptide) were carried out, whereby the vector “pSecTag2B_scFv PSCA(MB1)-E7B6 humanized” was generated. Cloning an Effector Module, “scBsTaFv CD3 (3×G4S)-7B6” Humanized that Binds to T Cells and to the E7B6 Peptide: For humanization of the variable region of the heavy chain of the 7B6 antibody (specifically directed against the peptide E7B6) overlapping oligonucleotides according to SEQ ID No. 156 to 160 were agglomerated. Afterwards the humanized nucleic acid sequence of the variable region of the heavy chain of the 7B6 antibody (with a G4S linker peptide, SEQ ID No. 132) was amplified with the aid of the primer pair according to SEQ ID No. 161 and 162. For humanization of the variable region of the light chain of the 7B6 antibody oligonucleotides according to SEQ ID No. 163 to 167 were agglomerated. The humanized nucleic acid sequence of the variable region of the light chain of the 7B6 antibody was amplified with the primer pair according to SEQ ID No. 168 and 169. Finally, the humanized nucleic acid sequences for 7B6 VH and 7B6 VL were agglomerated and amplified by means of overlap PCR using the primers according to SEQ ID No. 170 and 171. The thus generated nucleic acid sequence for humanized scFv 7B6 (VH-3×G4S-VL) was cloned humanized via XhoI and ApaI downstream of the humanized scFv CD3 VH-G4S-VL in “pSecTag2B_scFv CD3 VH-G4S-VL”, whereby the vector “pSecTag2B_scBsTafv CD3(G4S)-7B6 humanized” was generated. For the expression of the single fusion proteins of the modular targeting systems 1 and 2, Hek293T cells were transfected with the expression vectors, and the secreted recombinant scFv (scFv PSCA-E5B9 or scFv PSCA-E7B6) and the bispecific antibodies (scBsTaFv CD3 (G4S)-5B9 or scBsTaFv CD3 (3×G4S)-5B9 and scBsTaFv CD3-7B6) were purified from the cell culture supernatant with the aid of affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) (if necessary, in combination with a fractionated ammonium sulfate precipitation), By SDS PAGE and Immunoblot the purity and stability of the recombinant antibody derivatives were verified (FIG. 2). Example 3 Determination of the Dissociation Constant of Binding to PSCA The determination of the affinity constant for the respective anti-PSCA domain of the recombinant, bispecific antibodies with the anti-PSCA MB1 antibody (according to the invention) and the anti-PSCA 7F5 antibody (comparative example, antibody of [Feldmann 2010]) was based on a flow cytometric analysis of binding to PSCA-positive PC3 cells. For generating the binding curves of the recombinant anti-PSCA antibody domains, 2×105 PSCA-positive cells each were incubated with 100 μl of the bispecific antibodies (MB1 and 7F5) for 1 h at 4° C. The antibodies were used in the following concentrations, respectively: Antibody amount Antibody concentration per batch in ng in pmol/l 1,000 90,000 100 9,000 50 4,500 10 900 5 450 1 90 0.5 45 0.1 9 0.05 4.5 0.01 0.9 0.001 0.09 To verify the specific binding of the recombinant CD3-PSCA antibodies, a mouse-anti-c-myc IgG-FITC assay antibody (AbD Serotec, Düsseldorf, Germany) was used which after completion of the first staining step was incubated for 30 min at 4° C. with the anti-PSC antibody marked PSCA-positive cells. As a negative control, a sample was carried along in which PSCA-positive cells were stained only with the assay antibody mouse-anti-c-myc IgG-FITC. The cells were analyzed in a BD FACS Calibur Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, Heidelberg, Germany) and the data were evaluated with the aid of the software WinMDI 2.8 (Joseph Trotter, La Jolla, Calif. USA). For evaluation, the ascertained MFI values (mean fluorescence intensity values) were plotted against the tested antibody concentrations and in each case a trend line of the polynomic regression type of the second order was calculated. To determine the affinity constant, a trend line was calculated of the polynomic regression type of the second order and was inserted. The binding curve resulting therefrom served as a basis for calculating the affinity constant KD which is defined as that concentration which is reached at 50% value of the maximum MFI value and therefore is reached at half-maximum saturation of binding. To calculate this constant, the first derivative of the binding curve which follows a square function was formed first. To determine the maximum of the function based on this equation, the first derivative was set to “zero” and solved for x. The maximum of the function ymax and therefore ymax/2 which corresponds to the MFI value at half-maximum saturation of the binding sites was calculated by using the obtained value of x in the source equation. Because the KD value corresponds to the x value at ymax/2, it can be finally calculated by employing the ymax/2 value in the square function of the binding curve and transpose the equation for x. The following KD values were determined in this manner for binding to PSCA: KD scBsTaFv CD3xPSCA (MB1) 6.3 × 10−7 scBsTaFv CD3xPSCA (7F5) 2.3 × 10−6 It was possible to demonstrate in this way that the affinity of the anti-PSCA antibody according to the invention to the antigen PSCA is higher by an order of magnitude in comparison to the antibody 7F5 of the prior art. Example 4 Specific Lysis of PSCA+ Cells with Bispecific Anti-PSCA Antibodies In a chrome release test, preactivated PBMCs 5×104 were co-cultured with 5×103 51Cr-loaded PC3-PSCA tumor cells (effector target ratio=10:1) in presence and absence of the recombinant antibodies in RPMI medium in a total volume of 200 μl. For this purpose, the antibodies according to the invention of example 1 were used (in murine as well as in humanized form). As a comparative example the murine anti-PSCA(7F5) antibody known in the prior art was used in a bispecific antibody of the same configuration. The variable regions of the 7F5 antibody correspond to: heavy chain SEQ ID No. 48 light chain SEQ ID No. 50. Experiments with the following concrete antibody constructs were carried out: 1. humanized bispecific scBsTaFv CD3-PSCA(MB1) from example 12. murine bispecific scBsTaFv CD3-PSCA (MB1) from example 13. humanized bispecific scBsTaFv CD3-PSCA(7F5) (comparative example)4. murine bispecific scBsTaFv CD3-PSCA(7F5) (comparative example) After 20 h incubation at 37° C. in an incubator the chrome released into the medium was measured. The specific lysis was calculated as follows: [in-line-formulae]Specific lysis in %=[released 51Cr−spontaneously released 51Cr(minimum)]/[maximally released 51Cr(maximum)−minimum]×100%[/in-line-formulae] The results of the in vitro experiment are graphically shown in FIG. 3. The percentage proportion of lysed PC3 cells relative to the total of employed PC3 cells (Y axis) is shown. While the antibodies according to the invention of the experimental groups 1 and 2 already at amounts of less than 1 ng exhibit a strong lysis of the PSCA-positive cells, a detectable lysis can be found with the known 7F5 antibodies in a comparable construct (experimental groups 3 and 4) only upon use of several ng of the antibody. A maximum lysis of about 60% of the employed PC3 cells was determined. With the antibodies according to the invention, a lysis of about 80% of the employed PC3 cells was already observed when using a clearly lower antibody amount. Maximally, more than 90% of the employed PC3 cells were lysed with an antibody according to the invention (experimental group 1). Example 5 Inhibition of the Tumor Growth by scBsTaFv CD3-PSCA(MB1) Humanized in vivo As a proof of the efficacy of the anti-PSCA MB1 antibody according to the invention, the effect of a bispecific antibody scBsTaFv CD3-PSCA(MB1) derived from it and produced according to example 1 (schematically shown in FIG. 1A, at the top), was tested in the murine tumor model. As a model organism naked mice were used which form tumors after transfer of PSCA-positive PC3 tumor cells. In the experiment, PSCA-positive tumor cells in combination with T cells and an antibody were transferred. The following antibodies were used for this purpose wherein per mouse 10 μg of antibody were injected: (1) bispecific control antibody anti-CD3×anti-5B9 (control)(2) monospecific humanized scFv anti-PSCA(MB1) from example 1 control)(3) control without antibody (negative control)(4) humanized bispecific scBsTaFv CD3-PSCA(MB1) from example 1(5) humanized bispecific scBsTaFv CD3-PSCA(7F5) as described in example 3 (comparative example)(6) humanized bispecific scBsDb CD3×PSCA(7F5) which contains the PSCA-binding variable regions of the 7F5 antibody (comparative example) The effect of the bispecific antibodies is based on the recruitment of the CD3-positive T cells to the PSCA-positive tumor cells and the lysis of the tumor cells mediated thereby. In a first experiment 5×103 PSCA-positive tumor cells were transferred into 8 naked mice in each experimental group and 5×103 T cells (effector target ratio 1:1). In the control groups (1) and (3) rapid tumor growth was found in the absence of an anti-PSCA antibody. The control (2) in which monospecific scFv anti-PSCA(MB1) was injected also showed rapid tumor growth. A cytotoxic effect of the monospecific antibody can thereby be excluded and the efficacy can be assigned solely to the bispecific construct. The tumor surface area of the formed tumors was determined 25 days after cell transfer. The three control groups showed no significant difference in the tumor surface area (FIG. 4A). With transfer of the bispecific comparative antibodies which contain the variable regions of the anti-PSCA 7F5 antibody (comparative groups (5) in the form of a tandem antibody and (6) in the form of a diabody) also a rapid tumor growth was found (data not shown). In a second experiment in which the tumor cells in an effector target ratio of 10:1 (that is with a 10-fold amount of T cells; transfer of 5×103 PSCA-positive tumor cells and 5×104 T cells), a rapid tumor growth was also found that showed no statistically significant difference to the control group (1) (FIG. 4B). The tumor growth was not inhibited by the anti-PSCA 7F5 antibodies but was merely delayed somewhat. Even with T cell excess, no in vivo inhibition of the tumor growth by the anti-PSCA 7F5 antibody can be observed. The transfer of the bispecific antibody scBsTaFv CD3-PSCA(MB1) according to the invention from example 1 with an effector target ratio 1:1 was able to reduce the tumor growth significantly. During 25 days after cell transfer in 2 of the 8 test animal tumors with a clearly reduced surface area (diameter about 2 mm) appeared, 6 of the 8 test animals remained free of tumor (FIG. 4A). The anti-PSCA MB1 antibody according to the invention (experimental group (4)) is therefore clearly superior to the comparably built anti-PSCA 7F5 antibody (experiment group (5)) concerning in vivo efficacy under identical experimental conditions.
