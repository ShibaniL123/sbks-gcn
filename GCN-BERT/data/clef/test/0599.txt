Field of the Device The present device relates to a multifunctional golf tee, and more particularly, to a multifunctional golf tee which can show both functions of a long tee and a short tee. 2. Background of the Related Art Generally, a golf tee which is used for a tee shot is divided into a long tee for driver tee shot and a short tee for an iron tee shot, and there are tees called as a ‘middle tee’ and a ‘long long tee’ according to users' needs. Golfers usually have at least two tees out of the above-mentioned four tees for rounding, but the tees are inconvenient because they are not formed integrally but must be carried separately. Of course, in order to solve such a problem, there is a tee of the form that the long tee and the short tee are connected by a string. Moreover, the golfer holds a ball marker for putting, but it is also inconvenient because the ball marker is also carried individually from the ball marker. In the meantime, the conventional golf tee just provides the basic function that a golfer puts a ball on the tee and does not have a function to hold a shot direction. In general, when the golfer takes the shot direction using an additional thing, it is a penalty stroke, but it is not the penalty stroke to use the golf tee to take the shot direction. Furthermore, golfers usually stick the long tee or the short tee to a wanted height, but it is difficult to accurately adjust the depth that the tee is inserted into the ground and is not easy to keep a predetermined height all the time. SUMMARY OF THE DEVICE Accordingly, the present device has been made in view of the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, and it is an object of the present device to provide a multifunctional golf tee which can show both functions of a long tee and a short tee.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Hereinafter, an explanation on a multifunctional golf tee according to embodiments of the present device will be in detail given with reference to the attached drawing. However, it would be understood that the embodiments disclosed in the present device are to describe the present device in detail in such a manner that those skilled in the art can easily execute the present device but the technical scope of the present device are not limited by the preferred embodiments. In the drawings, the same components have the same reference numerals even though they are illustrated in different figures. Referring to FIGS. 1 to 4, the multifunctional golf tee according to a preferred embodiment of the present device will be described. As shown in the drawings, the multifunctional golf tee includes a first body 10, a second body 20, a third body 30 and a plate 40. The first body 10 and the second body 20 may be connected to each other or separated from each other. First, the first body 10 is separated from the second body 20 to be used as a short tee. Furthermore, the first body 10 may be used as a long tee in a state where it is joined to the second body 20. The first body 10 includes: a sharp-pointed lower end 12 to be stuck in the ground; a middle end 13 formed in a cylinder shape; and an upper end having a seating side (which has no reference numeral) expanded to allow a golfer to put a golf ball on the upper side. The first body 10 may be used as the short tee as it is or a short tee made of a wood material may be applied thereto. The first body 10 can be replaced with a new one when it is damaged. The second body 20 includes a sharp-pointed lower end to be stuck in the ground; and an upper end having a recess 22 to which the lower end of the first body 10 is fit and joined. The second body 20 has a protruding jaw 24 formed on the edge thereof to a predetermined height, and the protruding jaw 24 is disposed to prevent a downward separation of the plate 40. Moreover, the second body 20 has a first retaining part 26 formed on the edge of the upper side part in a concave-convex form, and the first retaining part 26 is disposed to be firmly connected with the third body 30. The second body 20 may be made of wood, metal or synthetic resin. The golfer can use this golf tee as a short tee by sticking only the first body 10 in the ground or as a long tee by connecting the first body 10 to the second body 20 and sticking the lower end of the second body 20 in the ground, and easily converts the golf tee into the short tee or the long tee as occasion demands. The third body 30 has a hollow part 32 and may have one of various outward appearances. The hollow part 32 of the third body 30 has an inner diameter of the size that the lower end 12 and the middle end 13 of the first body 10 are inserted into the hollow part 32 of the third body 30 to penetrate through the hollow part 32 of the third body 30 and the upper end 14 of the first body 10 is not inserted into the hollow part 32. Therefore, when the first body 10 is inserted into the hollow part 32 of the third body 30, the upper end 14 of the first body 10 is seated and supported on the upper end (which has no reference numeral) of the third body 30. Moreover, an upper side part of the second body 20 is fit and joined to the lower end of the third body 30, and in this instance, if the first retaining part 26 is formed on the edge of the upper side part of the second body 20, a second retaining part 36 of a concave-convex form corresponding to the first retaining part 26 of the second body 20 is formed on the inner surface of a lower end of the third body 30. The third body 30 surrounds a joined part between the first body 10 and the second body 20 and serves to join the first body 10 and the second body 20 stably. In the meantime, the third body 30 is arranged to be spaced apart from the upper end at a predetermined interval and includes: a seating part 34 on which the upper end of the first body is seated; and a connection rod 38 which connects the upper end of the third body 30 with the seating part 34. Here, the connection rod 38 is formed in an approximately ‘⊂’ shape and may be utilized as a tool to set a shot direction at the time of tee shot. For instance, when the second body 20 is stuck in the ground, if the golfer makes the connection rod 38 point to the direction to send the golf ball, it may help the golfer's shot, and it is not the penalty stroke because additional tool is not used. Furthermore, the connection rod 38 can provide the function as a hook, and for instance, the golfer can carry the golf tee by hanging the connection rod 38 on a hook of the golfer's belt. The third body 30 may be made of a silicon material, a synthetic resin material or a rubber material, but it is preferable that the third body 30 be made of a soft silicon material to prevent damage due to a blow of a golf club. In order to connect the third body 30 to the second body 20, the upper side part of the second body 20 is pushed into the lower end portion of the hollow part of the third body 30, and hence, the third body 30 can be always connected to the second body 20. Additionally, as occasion demands, when the golfer inserts the first body 10 into the hollow part of the third body 30, the first body 10 is joined to the recess 22 of the second body 20 such that the golf tee can be used as the long tee. After that, when the golfer separates the first body 10 from the second body 20, the golf tee can be used as the short tee. Meanwhile, means for uniformly keeping the depth that the second body 20 is stuck may be needed, and it can be achieved by the plate 40. The plate 40 is to make the second body 20 be stuck to a predetermined depth, and has a hollow part 42 to make the second body 20 be inserted and joined to a predetermined height. Therefore, because the golfer sticks the second body 20 in the ground till the plate 40 is settled on the ground, it can uniformly keep the depth that the second body 20 is stuck. The plate 40 may be press-fit to the edge of the second body 20, but the second body 20 may have the protruding jaw 24 formed on the edge thereof in order to prevent the downward separation of the plate 40. The plate 40 may be formed in a thin disc type, and can be used as a ball marker when it is separated from the second body 20. Therefore, the plate 40 can serve the function to uniformly keep the depth that the second body 20 is stuck and the function as the ball marker. Moreover, because the golf tee has the ball marker formed integrally, the golfer does not need to additionally carry the ball marker. Therefore, the golf tee is easy to be carried and minimizes a loss ratio. For reference, the plate 40 may be made of the silicon material for easy connection and separation, but the present device is not restricted to the above and various materials may be applied to the plate 40. The golf tee according to the embodiment of the present device can provide both functions, of the short tee and the long tee and the function of the ball marker and carry out the function to take the shot direction, thereby providing the golfer with convenience. Referring to FIG. 5, a multifunctional golf tee according to another preferred embodiment of the present device will be described. As shown in the drawing, the multifunctional golf tee includes a first body 10, a second body 20 and a plate 40. That is, in the second preferred embodiment of the present device, the third body 30 is omitted from the configuration of the multifunctional golf tee according to the first preferred embodiment of the present device. The first body 10 and the second body 20 can be connected with each other and separated from each other. That is, the first body 10 is separated from the second body 20 to be used as a short tee, and is connected to the second body 20 to be used as a long tee. As described above, the first body 10 includes a sharp-pointed lower end to be stuck in the ground and a seating side formed on an upper end thereof such that the golf ball is put on the seating side. That is, the first body 10 may be applied as the general short tee, for instance, a short tee made of a wood material. The lower end of the first body 10 is fit and connected to an upper end of the second body 20, and the second body 20 has a sharp-pointed lower end to be stuck in the ground. That is, the first body 10 may be fit and connected to the upper end of the second body 20 or separated from the upper end of the second body 20. Therefore, the golfer may use the golf tee as a short tee by sticking only the first body 10 in the ground or as a long tee by sticking the lower end of the second body 20 in the ground after connecting the first body 10 to the second body 20. As occasion demands, the golfer can easily convert the golf tee into the short tee or the long tee. In the meantime, the golf tee includes the plate 40 to make the second body 20 be uniformly kept to the depth that the second body 20 is stuck in the ground, and as described above, the plate 40 can serve the function as the ball marker.
