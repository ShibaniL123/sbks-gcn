[0019] Additional features and advantages are described herein, and will be apparent from, the following Detailed Description. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0020] The present disclosure relates to jelly confectionery products and methods for producing the jelly confectionery products. When making confectionery products, stabilizers are typically standardized using sugar (e.g., dextrose). It has surprisingly been found that the use of a fiber in combination with a stabilizer not only allows sugar to be replaced as a standardizing agent, but also provides a beneficial dietary element to a confectionery product. The stabilizer/fiber blend can be used to produce beneficial jelly confectionary products that can be free of added sugar or com syrup. [0021] As used herein, the term “jelly confectionery product” means that the jelly confectionery product comprises a hydrocolloid or gel-based confectionery as understood by the skilled artisan. [0022] As used herein, the term “stabilizer” means a processing aid that is used in food applications for various functional purposes such as (a) gelling (b) thickening and indirectly (c) emulsifying. Stabilizers maintain the physico-chemical state of food matrices enabling the maintenance of a homogenous dispersion of two or more immiscible substances. [0023] As used herein, the phrase “free of added sugar or com syrup” means being completely free of or having a substantially reduced amount (i.e., less than 1% by weight) of added sugar and/or com syrup. It should be noted, however, that the jelly confectionery product may contain sugar or other simple carbohydrates from the fruit juice and/or fruit puree, as natural components of the fmits. [0024] In a general embodiment, the present disclosure provides a jelly blend including a stabilizer and a fiber that can be standardized without sugar or com syrup. For example, the jelly blend can include from about 10% to about 90% by weight of a stabilizer and from about 10% to about 90% by weight of a fiber. [0025] In any embodiments of the jelly blends described herein, the amount of stabilizer in the jelly blend can range between about 10% to about 90% by weight including about 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85% by weight and the like. It should be appreciated that any two amounts of the stabilizer can further represent end points in a preferred range of the stabilizer in the jelly blend. For example, the amounts of 15% and 25% by weight can represent the individual amounts of the stabilizer in the jelly blend as well as a preferred range of the stabilizer between about 15% and about 25% by weight of the jelly blend. In an embodiment, the amount of stabilizer in the jelly blend can range between about 10% to about 30% by weight. [0026] In any embodiments of the jelly blends described herein, the amount of fiber in the jelly blend can range between about 10% to about 90% by weight including about 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85% by weight and the like. It should be appreciated that any two amounts of the fiber can further represent end points in a preferred range of the fiber in the jelly blend. For example, the amounts of 73% and 86% by weight can represent the individual amounts of the fiber in the jelly blend as well as a preferred range of the fiber between about 73% and about 86% by weight of the jelly blend. In an embodiment, the amount of fiber in the jelly blend can range between about 70% to about 90% by weight. [0027] In any embodiments of the jelly blend described herein, the stabilizer can be, for example, carrageenan, pectin, alginate, gelatin, agar, gellan gum, xanthan gum, cellulose gum, gum arabic, modified starch or a combination thereof. In preferred embodiments of the jelly blend described herein, the stabilizer can be, for example, carrageenan, pectin, alginate, gelatin, modified starch or a combination thereof. In any embodiments of the jelly blend described herein, the fiber can be, for example, cellulose, inulin, mannooligosaccharide, acacia gum, guar gum, microcrystalline cellulose, polydextrose, dextrin, fructooligosaccharide, carboxymethyl cellulose or a combination thereof. In preferred embodiments of the jelly blend described herein, the fiber can be, for example, cellulose, inulin, mannooligosaccharide, microcrystalline cellulose, fructooligosaccharide or a combination thereof. [0028] In another general embodiment, the present disclosure provides a jelly confectionery product having 1) an ingredient including fruit juice, fruit puree or a combination thereof, and 2) a jelly blend including a stabilizer ranging from about 10% to about 90% by weight of the blend and a fiber ranging from about 10% to about 90% by weight of the blend. It should be appreciated that the fruit juice can be provided as fruit juice concentrate. In any embodiments of the jelly confectionery product described herein, the jelly confectionery product can be free of added sugar or com syrup. [0029] In any embodiments of the jelly confectionery product described herein, the amount of fiber in the jelly confectionery product can range from about 1% to about 15% by weight of the jelly confectionery product. For instance, the amount of fiber in the jelly confectionery product can range between about 1% to about 15% by weight including about 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14% by weight and the like. It should be appreciated that any two amounts of the fiber can further represent end points in a preferred range of the fiber in the jelly confectionery product. For example, the amounts of 4% and 7% by weight can represent the individual amounts of the fiber in the jelly confectionery product as well as a preferred range of the fiber between about 4'% and about 7% by weight of the jelly confectionery product. It should be further appreciated that, depending on the fruit ingredient, fiber may also come from the fmit ingredient. However, this source of fibers is marginal over the fibers from the jelly blend. [0030] In any embodiments of the jelly confectionery product described herein, the stabilizer can be, for example, carrageenan, pectin, alginate, gelatin, agar, gellan gum, xanthan gum, cellulose gum, gum arabic, modified starch or a combination thereof.

[0032] It should be appreciated that the one or more ingredients such as flavors, colors, spices, acids (e.g., food grade acids such as ascorbic acid, citric acid) and/or actives (e.g., listed below) can go in the jelly confectionery product in a free form in any suitable amount. The ingredients can also be added in the form of encapsulation, compaction, granulation and agglomeration to provide, for example, protected and longer-lasting ingredient components such as flavors. It should also be appreciated that the jelly confectionery products can comprise any suitable number and combinations of the flavors, acids and/or actives. [0033] In addition to the fruit juice or fruit puree, any additional flavorants or flavors used in the jelly confectionery products may include any natural or synthetic oil and/or flavor as is commonly known in the art. Natural and artificial flavoring agents may be combined in any sensorially acceptable fashion. The flavor agents can be used in any suitable amount in the jelly confectionery products. [0034] Nonlimiting examples of suitable flavorants include natural and synthetic flavoring agents chosen from synthetic flavor oils and flavoring aromatics, and/or oils, oleo resins and extracts derived from plants, leaves, flowers, fruits, vegetables and so forth, and combinations thereof. Nonlimiting examples of flavor oils include spearmint oil, cinnamon oil, oil of wintergreen (methyl salicylate), peppermint oils, clove oil, bay oil, anise oil, eucalyptus oil, thyme oil, cedar leaf oil, oil of nutmeg, oil of sage, oil of bitter almonds, and cassia oil.

[0035] It is understood that these flavorants may be used alone or in combination with or without a sensate such as, for example, a cooling or heating agent as is commonly known in the art. The flavorant or flavor may be encapsulated or non-encapsulated. Encapsulated flavorant may be used to increase or decrease the flavor release rate as is commonly known in the art. [0036] Spices can be any one or more fresh, dried or extracted seeds, fruits, roots, barks, or vegetative substances used in nutritionally insignificant quantities as a jelly confectionery product additive to add flavor, color, or as a preservative that kills harmful bacteria or prevents their growth.
