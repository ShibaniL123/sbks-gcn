METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR DETECTING EXPRESSION OF TARGET GENES I. CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION In certain aspect, this application relates to Chinese patent application No. 201310032768.2, filed January 25, 2013, the content of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. II. TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to methods and compositions, and uses thereof, for simultaneously detecting expression of multiple target genes in a sample. The present invention further relates to certain isolated polynucleotides that can be used as primers or primer pairs in the present methods and compositions for simultaneously detecting expression of multiple target genes in a sample. III. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In recent years, pharmacogenetics/pharmacogenomics have made great progress in research on functional mechanisms of anti-tumor drugs. Scientists discovered that there was great relationship between tumor cell killing effect of some anti-tumor drugs and a certain kind (or group) of genes expression and/or polymorphism. It has been a reasonable choice to improve the curative effect and reduce invalid treatment by detecting related genes, predicating the effect of chemotherapy and targeting drugs, and choosing suitable drugs to personalize chemotherapy. A large number of clinical data indicated that the expression levels of 14 genes including ERCC1, RRM1, TYMS, TUBB3 etc. in tumor tissue could predicate patients' responses to commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs such as Platinum, Gemcitabine, 5-Fu, and other anti-microtubule drugs. To formulate a personalized treatment plan according to the gene expression levels in tumor tissue of patient is conducive to improve targeted therapy by using patient-specific chemotherapy drugs. Choosing chemotherapy drugs by target detection can avoid ineffective or harmful chemotherapy, save treatment time and cost, improve life quality of patients. So it is necessary to develop a multiple gene expression detection technique to detect the 14 gene expression levels so that doctors can quickly provide important information to patients for much safer and more efficient treatment. Currently, there are several traditional methods to detect gene expression (mRNA level). (1) PCR Commonly used PCR detection methods are fluorescence qPCR, immunity PCR and RT-PCR. Fluorescence qPCR detection method is the most mature. The advantages of qPCR are high sensitivity as well as quantitative, however, the disadvantages are low throughput and high cost. (2) Molecular hybridization— Northern blotting and RNA in situ hybridization Hybridization is the process of establishing a non-covalent, sequence-specific interaction between two or more complementary strands of nucleic acids into a single complex, which in the case of two strands is referred to as a duplex. Oligonucleotides, DNA, or RNA will bind to their complement under normal conditions. Hybridization is high sensitive and specific, so target sequence probes are used for the specific detection of known sequence. It is widely used in screening cloned gene, making restriction map, qualitative, quantitative detection of gene sequence and disease diagnosis. The disadvantages of molecular hybridization are complicated operation and low throughput. (3) Gene chip (DNA microarray) Gene chip is a collection of microscopic DNA spots attached to a solid surface. Scientists use DNA microarrays to measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously or to genotype multiple regions of a genome. Since an array can contain tens of thousands of probes, a microarray experiment can accomplish many genetic tests in parallel, however, high cost and the complexity of attaching probes limited its large-scale promotion. On the other hand, gene chip cannot be used to accurately quantify gene expression; scientists need large amount of nucleic acid in microarrays because of its low sensitivity. (4) Transcriptome sequencing Transcriptome sequencing refers to the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies to sequence cDNA in order to get information about a sample's RNA content. The technique has been adopted in studies of diseases like cancer. With deep coverage and base-level resolution, next-generation sequencing provides information on differential expression of genes, including gene alleles and differently spliced transcripts; non-coding RNAs; post-transcriptional mutations or editing; and gene fusions. Compared with the traditional DNA microarrays, transcriptome sequencing generates much more amount of digitized signal (data), but does not need to design probe oligos. However, the cost is 10-100 times high than microarrays, which might be the limitation for its application in clinical care. In brief, the four techniques mentioned above cannot meet the demand for rapid, accurate detection of multiple gene expression The present invention addresses this and other related needs in the field.

DEFINITIONS Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All patents, patent applications (published or unpublished), and other publications referred to herein are incorporated by reference in their entireties. If a definition set forth in this section is contrary to or otherwise inconsistent with a definition set forth in the patents, applications, published applications and other publications that are herein incorporated by reference, the definition set forth in this section prevails over the definition that is incorporated herein by reference. As used herein, "a" or "an" means "at least one" or "one or more." As used herein, "mammal" refers to any of the mammalian class of species. Frequently, the term "mammal," as used herein, refers to humans, human subjects or human patients. As used herein, the term "subject" is not limited to a specific species or sample type. For example, the term "subject" may refer to a patient, and frequently a human patient. However, this term is not limited to humans and thus encompasses a variety of mammalian species. As used herein the term "sample" refers to anything which may contain an analyte for which an analyte assay is desired. The sample may be a biological sample, such as a biological fluid or a biological tissue. Examples of biological fluids include urine, blood, plasma, serum, saliva, semen, stool, sputum, cerebral spinal fluid, tears, mucus, amniotic fluid or the like. Biological tissues are aggregate of cells, usually of a particular kind together with their intercellular substance that form one of the structural materials of a human, animal, plant, bacterial, fungal or viral structure, including connective, epithelium, muscle and nerve tissues. Examples of biological tissues also include organs, tumors, lymph nodes, arteries and individual cell(s). The terms "polynucleotide," "oligonucleotide," "nucleic acid" and "nucleic acid molecule" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymeric form of nucleotides of any length, e.g., at least 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1,000 or more nucleotides, and may comprise ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides, analogs thereof, or mixtures thereof. This term refers only to the primary structure of the molecule. Thus, the term includes triple-, double- and single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid ("DNA"), as well as triple-, double- and single-stranded ribonucleic acid ("RNA"). It also includes modified, for example by alkylation, and/or by capping, and unmodified forms of the polynucleotide. More particularly, the terms "polynucleotide," "oligonucleotide," "nucleic acid" and "nucleic acid molecule" include polydeoxyribonucleotides (containing 2-deoxy-D-ribose), polyribonucleotides (containing D-ribose), including tRNA, rRNA, hRNA, and mRNA, whether spliced or unspliced, any other type of polynucleotide which is an N- or C-glycoside of a purine or pyrimidine base, and other polymers containing normucleotidic backbones, for example, polyamide (e.g., peptide nucleic acids ("PNAs")) and polymorpholino (commercially available from the Anti-Virals, Inc., Corvallis, OR., as Neugene) polymers, and other synthetic sequence-specific nucleic acid polymers providing that the polymers contain nucleobases in a configuration which allows for base pairing and base stacking, such as is found in DNA and RNA. Thus, these terms include, for example, 3'-deoxy-2',5'-DNA, oligodeoxyribonucleotide N3' to P5' phosphoramidates, 2'-0-alkyl-substituted RNA, hybrids between DNA and RNA or between PNAs and DNA or RNA, and also include known types of modifications, for example, labels, alkylation, "caps," substitution of one or more of the nucleotides with an analog, intemucleotide modifications such as, for example, those with uncharged linkages (e.g., methyl phosphonates, phosphotriesters, phosphoramidates, carbamates, etc.), with negatively charged linkages (e.g., phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, etc.), and with positively charged linkages (e.g., aminoalkylphosphoramidates, aminoalkylphosphotriesters), those containing pendant moieties, such as, for example, proteins (including enzymes (e.g. nucleases), toxins, antibodies, signal peptides, poly- L-lysine, etc.), those with intercalators (e.g., acridine, psoralen, etc.), those containing chelates (of, e.g., metals, radioactive metals, boron, oxidative metals, etc.), those containing alkylators, those with modified linkages (e.g., alpha anomeric nucleic acids, etc.), as well as unmodified forms of the polynucleotide or oligonucleotide. It will be appreciated that, as used herein, the terms "nucleoside" and "nucleotide" will include those moieties which contain not only the known purine and pyrimidine bases, but also other heterocyclic bases which have been modified. Such modifications include methylated purines or pyrimidines, acylated purines or pyrimidines, or other heterocycles. Modified nucleosides or nucleotides can also include modifications on the sugar moiety, e.g., wherein one or more of the hydroxyl groups are replaced with halogen, aliphatic groups, or are functionalized as ethers, amines, or the like. The term "nucleotidic unit" is intended to encompass nucleosides and nucleotides. "Nucleic acid probe" and "probe" are used interchangeably and refer to a structure comprising a polynucleotide, as defined above, that contains a nucleic acid sequence that can bind to a corresponding target. The polynucleotide regions of probes may be composed of DNA, and/or RNA, and/or synthetic nucleotide analogs. As used herein, "complementary or matched" means that two nucleic acid sequences have at least 50% sequence identity. Preferably, the two nucleic acid sequences have at least 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% of sequence identity. "Complementary or matched" also means that two nucleic acid sequences can hybridize under low, middle and/or high stringency condition(s). As used herein, "substantially complementary or substantially matched" means that two nucleic acid sequences have at least 90% sequence identity. Preferably, the two nucleic acid sequences have at least 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% of sequence identity. Alternatively, "substantially complementary or substantially matched" means that two nucleic acid sequences can hybridize under high stringency condition(s). In general, the stability of a hybrid is a function of the ion concentration and temperature. Typically, a hybridization reaction is performed under conditions of lower stringency, followed by washes of varying, but higher, stringency. Moderately stringent hybridization refers to conditions that permit a nucleic acid molecule such as a probe to bind a complementary nucleic acid molecule. The hybridized nucleic acid molecules generally have at least 60% identity, including for example at least any of 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95% identity. Moderately stringent conditions are conditions equivalent to hybridization in 50% formamide, 5x Denhardt's solution, 5x SSPE, 0.2% SDS at 42°C, followed by washing in 0.2x SSPE, 0.2% SDS, at 42°C. High stringency conditions can be provided, for example, by hybridization in 50% formamide, 5x Denhardt's solution, 5x SSPE, 0.2% SDS at 42°C, followed by washing in O. lx SSPE, and 0.1% SDS at 65°C. Low stringency hybridization refers to conditions equivalent to hybridization in 10% formamide, 5x Denhardt's solution, 6x SSPE, 0.2% SDS at 22°C, followed by washing in lx SSPE, 0.2% SDS, at 37°C. Denhardt's solution contains 1% Ficoll, 1% polyvinylpyrolidone, and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). 20x SSPE (sodium chloride, sodium phosphate, ethylene diamide tetraacetic acid (EDTA)) contains 3M sodium chloride, 0.2M sodium phosphate, and 0.025 M EDTA. Other suitable moderate stringency and high stringency hybridization buffers and conditions are well known to those of skill in the art and are described, for example, in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor Press, Plainview, N.Y. (1989); and Ausubel et al., Short Protocols in Molecular Biology, 4th ed., John Wiley & Sons (1999). Alternatively, substantial complementarity exists when an RNA or DNA strand will hybridize under selective hybridization conditions to its complement. Typically, selective hybridization will occur when there is at least about 65% complementary over a stretch of at least 14 to 25 nucleotides, preferably at least about 75%, more preferably at least about 90% complementary.

As used herein, "biological sample" refers to any sample obtained from a living or viral source or other source of macromolecules and biomolecules, and includes any cell type or tissue of a subject from which nucleic acid or protein or other macromolecule can be obtained. The biological sample can be a sample obtained directly from a biological source or a sample that is processed. For example, isolated nucleic acids that are amplified constitute a biological sample. Biological samples include, but are not limited to, body fluids, such as blood, plasma, serum, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, urine and sweat, tissue and organ samples from animals and plants and processed samples derived therefrom.

METHODS FOR SIMUTANEOUSLY DETECTING EXPRESSION OF TARGET GENES IN A SAMPLE In one aspect, the present disclosure provides for a method for simultaneously detecting expression of multiple target genes in a sample, which method comprises: a) obtaining total RNA or mRNA from a sample, said total RNA or mRNA comprising target RNA encoded by multiple target genes in said sample; b) obtaining a target cDNA corresponding to each of said target RNA from said total RNA or mRNA via reverse transcription using said total RNA or mRNA obtained in step a) as a template and a reverse transcription primer for each of said target RNA; c) obtaining an amplicon from each of said cDNA obtained in step b) via multiplex PCR using said cDNA as a template and a pair of PCR primers for amplifying each of said cDNA; and d) analyzing said multiple amplicons using capillary electrophoresis, wherein the sizes of said multiple amplicons range from about 50 base pairs (bp) to about 300 bp, the difference of said sizes between at least two adjacent amplicons in sizes is 2 or more bp, and said 2 or more bp size difference is generated using at least one spacer nucleotide in said reverse transcription primer and/or PCR primer(s), said spacer nucleotide(s) may or may not be complementary to the nucleotide(s) at the corresponding positions(s) of the target RNA and/or target cDNA, provided that when at least one of said spacer nucleotide(s) is complementary to the nucleotide(s) at the corresponding positions(s) of the target RNA and/or target cDNA, the sizes of said multiple amplicons range from about 50 base pairs (bp) to about 150 bp. The reverse transcription primer and the PCR primers can be designed by any suitable methods in the art. Often, factors such as amplicon length, product position, melting temperature (Tm) of the product, optimum annealing temperature (Ta Opt), and primer pair Tm mismatch calculation, can be considered in designing the primers. In some embodiments, the primers can be designed using known primer design software, e.g., Primer Premier, AllelelD®, and Beacon Designer™. Often, spacer nucleotide(s) can be added to the reverse transcription primer and/or the PCR primers to control or increase amplicon length. In some embodiments, spacer nucleotide(s) are not added to the reverse transcription primer and/or the PCR primers for any factors that are not related to amplicon length.

In still other embodiments, the difference of the sizes between at least half of any adjacent amplicons can be 3 or more bp, e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 orlO bp. In yet other embodiments, the difference of the sizes between all of any adjacent amplicons in sizes can be 3 or more bp, e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 orlO bp. In some embodiments, the reverse transcription primer is used in the reverse transcription step to obtain cDNA only, but is not used in the subsequent multiplex PCR step to obtain the amplicons. In other embodiments, the reverse transcription primer is used in the reverse transcription step to obtain cDNA, and is also used as one of the PCR primers in the subsequent multiplex PCR step to obtain the amplicons. In some embodiments, the reverse transcription primer can further comprise a first tag sequence. In other embodiments, one or both members of the pair of PCR primers can comprise a sequence that is identical to the sequence of the first tag sequence. In still other embodiments, the other member of the pair of PCR primers can comprise a second tag sequence. In some embodiments, one member of the pair of PCR primers comprises the reverse transcription primer that further comprises a first tag sequence and the other member of the pair of PCR primers comprises a sequence that is substantially complementary to a portion of the target cDNA and a second tag sequence. Using the above pair of PCR primers, the first PCR cycle or first two PCR cycles can generate a double-stranded DNA that comprises a sequence that is substantially complementary to the first tag sequence and the second tag sequence at its 5' end and 3' end, respectively. In other embodiments, the third and subsequent PCR cycles can use a pair of PCR primers that comprises one PCR primer that comprises a sequence that is identical to the sequence of the first tag sequence and another PCR primer comprises a sequence that is identical to the sequence of the second tag sequence. In some embodiments, amplification of at least a quarter, half or all of the cDNA involves the use of two pairs of PCR primers: a) one member of the first pair of PCR primers comprising the reverse transcription primer that further comprises a first tag sequence, and the other member of the first pair of PCR primers comprising a sequence that is substantially complementary to a portion of the target cDNA and a second tag sequence; and b) one member of the second pair of PCR primers comprising a sequence that is identical to the sequence of the first tag sequence, and the other member of the second pair of PCR primers comprising a sequence that is identical to the sequence of the second tag sequence. In some embodiments, the present methods can further comprise assessing expression of an internal reference gene. The present methods can further comprise assessing expression of any suitable number of internal reference genes, e.g., at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 internal reference genes. In some embodiments, the present methods can further comprise analyzing an amplicon of a PCR control polynucleotide. Any suitable PCR control polynucleotide can be used, e.g., a plasmid DNA such as pcDNA. In some embodiments, relative expression levels of multiple target genes and/or the internal reference gene(s) can be assessed based on a standard curve of each of the target genes and/or the internal reference gene(s). The standard curve can be established by any suitable methods. For example, the standard curve can be established based on a plot between a peak ratio ("R") of each of the target genes and/or the internal reference gene(s) over the amplicon of PCR control polynucleotide, and a function of R (f(R)). The data points in the standard curve can be obtained or selected by any suitable methods. For example, the data points in the standard curve can be obtained or selected by curve fitting of multiple data points. In some embodiments, the relative expression levels "κ" of a target gene can be calculated using the following formulae: κ" s¾ *: ; f(¾) ¾ ¾ (n = 4), where Rg is peak ratio of a target gene and the amplicon of PCR control polynucleotide (e.g., pcDNA), Rg = Ag/ApoDNA, Ri is peak ratio of an internal reference gene and the amplicon of PCR control polynucleotide (e.g., pcDNA), The present methods can be used for simultaneously detecting expression of any suitable number of target genes in a sample. For example, the present methods can be used for simultaneously detecting expression of at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1 1, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 or 30 target genes in a sample. The present methods can be used for any suitable purpose. For example, the present methods can be used for simultaneously detecting expression of the target genes that is associated with a therapy, e.g., a tumor or cancer therapy. In some embodiments, the present methods can be used for simultaneously detecting expression of the target genes that relates to the toxicity, ADR, efficacy and/or dosage of an anti-tumor or anticancer drug.

The exemplary multiplex gene expression detection method enables simultaneous detecting up to multiple RNA expression levels with high level of specificity (e.g., >99.9%), sensitivity (e.g., l-5ng of total RNA) and reliability, high- throughput, low cost, and low or no false-negative results. The exemplary method is based on multiplex PCR and capillary electrophoresis fragment separation. The samples analyzed could be fresh and frozen tissues, or FFPE blocks. Exemplary, specific primers are designed to effectively amplify short nucleotide sequences in FFPE samples. While designing the primers, the amplicon size is ranging from 50 to 300 bp, e.g., 60 to 90bp, with at least 2bp difference between the adjacent fragments. However, to thoroughly separate the adjacent fragments on a capillary electrophoresis system, often >3nt difference between adjacent fragments is required, therefore, spacers are introduced into the primer design. The spacers are served to stretch the fragment size for later CE separation, which can be 1-20 nucleotides located at the 5 '-ends of the specific primers beyond 16-20 nucleotides of the primers. The spacer nucleotides can be evenly added to the 5' end of forward and reverse primers. The exemplary kit can synchronously detect the gene expression levels of 14 genes that are related to the toxicity/ ADR, efficacy and dosage of over 20 anti-tumor drugs. The kit is often comprised of DNase/RNase Free water, 5 χ RT buffer, reverse transcription primers, reverse transcriptase, solution X, 10x PCR buffer, PCR primers, 25mM magnesium chloride solution, Taq DNA Polymerase, and the positive control. The reverse transcription primers can include the reverse primers of 14 genes and 4 RNA internal reference genes. The PCR primers can include the forward primers of 14 genes, the forward primers of 4 RNA internal reference genes, and the reverse and forward primers of PCR reaction reference. The positive control in the kit can be a mixture of RNA samples extracted from different kinds of FFPE tumor tissues. The test process can include: (1) Extraction of total RNA from tumor tissues including fresh and frozen tissues, or FFPE blocks. (2) Reverse transcription using patient total RNAs as templates. The recommended RT reaction system can be RNA sample 5-20ng, 5 x RT buffer 4 μί, RT primer mix 2 μί, reverse transcriptase 1 μί, and DEPC water to total 20 μί,. The reaction condition can be 48°C for 1 min, 42°C for 60 min, 95°C for 5 min and 4°C incubation until PCR reaction started. (3) PCR amplification.

(4) Signal separation using CE. The recommended PCR reaction system can be PCR product 1 μ ί, sample loading solution (SLS) 38.75 \L, DNA marker 0.5 \L and a drop of mineral oil. (5) Standard Curve Serial Points The relative gene expression levels of unknown samples can be determined by calculation based on the standard curve serial points. The standard curve serial points can be generated by analysis of series of 2-fold diluted FFPE RNA sample mix, containing RNA of 80ng, 40ng, 20ng, lOng, 5ng, 2.5ng, 1.25ng and 0.625ng. Each target gene, including internal RNA reference genes, has its specific standard curve serial points (Figure 1). We defined "R" as peak ratio of each gene and pcDNA then f(R) is the function of R in the standard curve which is obtained by curve fitting of four data points which are selected in its standard curve serial points using the method like local southern according to R. Based on the standard curve of both candidate and internal reference genes, we calculated the relative expression levels "κ" of candidate genes in unknown samples as following: A. n * (n = 4) Where Rg is peak ratio of a candidate gene and pcDNA, Rg = Ag/AP0DNA, Ri is peak ratio of an internal reference gene and pcDNA, Compared with present technologies, the exemplary embodiment has several advantages: the exemplary embodiment enables an user to detect multiple gene expression levels (up to 30 genes) simultaneously, 1-10 internal RNA controls and reaction controls using FFPE samples as template.
