FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a composition comprising (a) cabazitaxel and (b) sulfobutyl ether beta cyclodextrin. Such composition exhibits unexpectedly desirable stability in aqueous media, thus permitting therapeutic dosages of the drug to be administered without need of ethanol and surfactants. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cabazitaxel, (1S ,2S ,3R,4S ,7R,9S,10S,12R,15S)-4-(Acetyloxy)-15-{[(2R,35)-3-{[(tert-butoxy)carbonyl]amino}-2-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoyl]oxy}-1-hydroxy-9,12-dimethoxy-10,14,17,17-tetramethyl-11-oxo-6-oxatetracyclo[11.3103,10.04,7]heptadec-13-ene-2-yl benzoate, is a microtubule inhibitor which is being investigated for a number of cancer treatments, including head and neck cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), glioma, bladder cancer, gastric and esophageal cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Cabazitaxel has been specifically designed to overcome multidrug resistance (MDR) associated with paclitaxel and docetaxel and with many other anticancer drugs. Due to its poor solubility in water, the commercial formulation of cabazitaxel (JEVTANA®) employs polysorbate 80 (a surfactant) as a solubilizer and ethanol as a diluent. Due to the presence of such surfactant and ethanol this formulation requires that a patient be premedicated with an antihistamine, a corticosteroid and an H2 antagonist. Such formulation further requires a two-step preparation process prior to infusion into a patient. In the first step a vial containing cabazitaxel and an excipient must be mixed with another vial containing ethanol; in the second step, this mixed solution is then diluted with saline or 5% dextrose. According to its label, the JEVTANA® dosing solution must be used within eight hours at room temperature, or within 24 hour if refrigerated. Both time limits include infusion time of approximately 1 hour. Accordingly, it would be desirable to possess a cabazitaxel formulation which exhibited increased stability; which did not require the presence of surfactant and/or ethanol; and which could be prepared in a more simple and convenient process. While the prior art has proposed the formulation of related compounds, such as docetaxel with substituted cyclodextrins, such formulations still contain ethanol. Thus, for example, Young et al (U.S. Pat. No. 8,481,511) disclose inclusion complexes of docetaxel and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin or sulfobutyl-beta-cyclodextrin in a ratio of 1:10-150. The complexes are prepared as follows: docetaxel dissolved in ethanol is added into water solution of cyclodextrin via stirring, until docetaxel is completely dissolved; said solution is filtered in 0.2-04 μm microporous membrane then ethanol is removed through reduced pressure to obtain the inclusion complex in a liquid form; or ethanol, followed by water is removed through reduced pressure, then dried to obtain the inclusion complex in a solid form. Young et al stress the benefits of the reduced ethanol concentration in their final compositions stating that the “low residual ethanol level provided a favorable guarantee for improving the docetaxel stability and reducing irritation and other side effects”. Consequently, it is unexpected that an improved formulation of cabazitaxel could be prepared using sulfobutyl ether beta cyclodexctrin which formulation did not contain any residual ethanol. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a composition comprising (a) cabazitaxel and (b) sulfobutyl ether beta cyclodextrin (“SBECD”). Typically, the weight ratio of cabazitaxel to SBECD is between 1:30 and 1:1000; preferably, such ratio is between 1:90 and 1:200. In one particularly preferred embodiment the composition of this invention comprises cabazitaxel and SBECD in weight ratio around 1:133. Such composition may optionally further comprise additional components added to improve its pharmaceutical properties. In particular, an acid, a base, and/or a salt can be added to the composition to adjust the pH and the tonicity of the composition. It is particularly preferred that HCl, NaOH, citric acid and NaCl are used to adjust the pH and the tonicity of the composition. In certain embodiments the composition is a sterile liquid aqueous solution suitable for administration by intravenous injection or infusion and comprises between 0.5% and 70% SBECD, preferably between 1% and 40% SBECD, and more preferably between 2% and 20% SBECD. In other embodiments the composition of this invention is in the form of sterile solid lyophilizate or in the form of an aqueous solution comprising between 2% and 70% SBECD, preferably between 20% and 60%; both of which forms are suitable for storage. The compositions of this invention may be prepared by mixing cabazitaxel with an aqueous solution of SBECD. Such compositions are typically mixed at room temperature, although higher or lower temperatures may be employed. The mixture is then typically filtered and stored. If desired the filtered solution may be freeze dried for storage. EXAMPLES Example 1 Cabazitaxel Solubility in Aqueous SBECD Excess of cabazitael was mixed with aqueous SBECD solutions for 16 hours at 23° C. The resulting suspension was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter, and the clear filtrate solution was analyzed by HPLC. The concentration of cabazitaxel in solutions is presented in the table below.

The solution was filtered through a 0.22 μm filter. Example 4 Preparation of Lyophilized Composition of Cabazitaxel and SBECD The solution of the Example 3 was frozen quickly using dry ice. The frozen material was freeze dried. Example 5 Reconstitution of Cabazitaxel Composition in Isotonic NaCl Solution 9.80 mL of 0.9% aqueous NaCl was added to 200 mg of the lyophilized composition of the Example 3. The mixture was gently mixed to produce clear a solution comprising 0.15 mg/mL cabazitaxel solution in 2% SBECD with 0.9% NaCl. Example 6 Pharmacokinetcs Female Sprague-Dawley rats, 8 animals per group, received 1 hour i.v. infusion of solution of the Example 3, or solution comprising cabazitaxel, polysorbate 80, ethanol and water, equivalent to the commercial composition of cabazitaxel. Both compositions were administered at the dose 8 mg/kg. Blood samples were collected at 0.5, 1, 1.08, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 hours post beginning of the infusion; three samples from each animal were taken during the sampling. Plasma levels of cabazitaxel in each sample were determined using HPLC. The results are presented in the table below. The results demonstrate that the solution of the Example 3 and the solution equivalent to the commercial composition of cabazitaxel provide equivalent exposure to cabazitaxel.
