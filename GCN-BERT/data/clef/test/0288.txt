No. 13/609,850, entitled Helmet, by James D. Wegener, filed on Sep. 11, 2012. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to safety devices, specifically to a helmet having a safety buckle system. 2. Description of the Related Art A helmet is a form of protective gear worn on the head to protect it from injuries. All helmets attempt to protect the user's head by absorbing mechanical energy and protecting against penetration. Their structure and protective capacity are altered in high-energy impacts. Beside their energy-absorption capability, their volume and weight are also important issues, since higher volume and weight increase the injury risk for the user's head and neck. Anatomical helmets adapted to the inner head structure were invented by neurosurgeons at the end of the 20th century. Helmets used for different purposes have different designs. For example, a bicycle helmet must protect against blunt impact forces from the wearer's head striking the road. A helmet designed for rock climbing must protect against heavy impact, and against objects such as small rocks and climbing equipment falling from above. Practical concerns also dictate helmet design: a bicycling helmet should be aerodynamic in shape and well ventilated, while a rock climbing helmet must be lightweight and small so that it does not interfere with climbing. In addition, a football helmet is a protective device used primarily in American football and Canadian football. It consists of a hard plastic top with thick padding on the inside, a face mask made of one or more rubber coated metal bars, and a chinstrap. Some players add polycarbonate visors to their helmets, which are used to protect eyes from glare and impacts. Helmets are a requirement at all levels of organized football, except for non-tackle variations such as flag football. Although they are protective, players can and do still suffer head injuries such as a concussion. Each position has a different type of face mask to balance protection and visibility. Some improvements have been made in the field. Examples of references related to the present invention are described below in their own words, and the supporting teachings of each reference are incorporated by reference herein: U.S. Pat. No. 6,003,156, issued to Anderson, discloses a Safety Helmet Lockout System comprised of a safety helmet with a uniquely keyed system contained within its cranial webbing and chinstrap that has the ability to sense when said helmet is securely strapped upon the wearers head. The chinstrap contains a locking buckle which releases a uniquely keyed enabling key and/or a signal upon sensing that said safety helmet is securely strapped upon the wearers head. Several means of sensing are possible, but the preferred embodiment employs physio sensors located within the cranial webbing and chinstrap of said safety helmet. The locking buckle which is located on the chinstrap, releases said enabling key or signal after receiving signals from all the physio sensors, and sensing tension in the chinstrap. The released enabling key, or emitted signal, can then be used to access vehicles, sporting goods, industrial equipment, tools, passage locks, and the like. The access locks can range from simple ignition locks and passage locks, to retracting pin or keyed brake systems, keyed clutch systems, and specialty lockout systems for certain applications (such as, but not limited to, skiis, snowboards, and snowmobiles). U.S. Pat. No. 5,946,735, issued to Bayes, discloses a quick-release football helmet chin strap that incorporates the use of a hook and loop fastener to tighten the strap and secure the helmet to the player's head. Intended for use on newly produced helmets and replacing the snap-type fasteners on existing helmets, the use of the hook and loop fasteners eliminates the burden associated with using the snap fasteners during the frequent between-play attachment and detachment. U.S. Pat. No. 4,279,037, issued to Morgan, discloses an adjustable suspension for protective headgear wherein a constantly uniform tension on all securing members of the suspension can be simultaneously increased or decreased uniformly through a one-step tension control device without removing the headgear from the wearer's head. A chin-strapless embodiment which anchors against vertical displacement on the forehead and skull base. Detachable chin strap with concealed dual locking fastener. A headgear wherein the protective elements are supported by an adjustable, detachable suspension. U.S. Patent Application Publication No.: 2010/0319701, by Connell, discloses a respirator assembly has a respirator mask and a separate bracing device. The bracing device has a pressure element mountable over a frontpiece of the respirator mask, which bears against that frontpiece to hold the respirator mask against the face of a user. The bracing device also has two connection portions, each having one end attached to the pressure element and the other end being for attaching the bracing device to a helmet worn by the user. The connection portions are extendable. Thus, shortening or distending the connection portions reduces the distance between the helmet and the respirator mask and thereby causes the pressure element to bear against the frontpiece of the respirator mask, compressing the user's head between the helmet and the mask and thereby holding the mask against the user's face. The inventions heretofore known suffer from a number of disadvantages which include being unsafe, being unable to securely couple a helmet to a wearer, being difficult to use, being uncomfortable, being unable to securely couple a chin strap to a helmet; being easily removed; being easily knocked off; coming unsnapped on impact; coming uncoupled when pressure is applied on the strap in a forward direction; being difficult to detach; and the like. What is needed is a helmet that solves one or more of the problems described herein and/or one or more problems that may come to the attention of one skilled in the art upon becoming familiar with this specification. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been developed in response to the present state of the art, and in particular, in response to the problems and needs in the art that have not yet been fully solved by currently available helmets. Accordingly, the present invention has been developed to provide a helmet including a safety buckle system configured to securely couple a helmet to a wearer. According to one embodiment of the invention, there is a helmet that may include a protective head covering. The protective head covering may have a first side region and a second side region. The first side region may be disposed opposite of second side region. The helmet may include a chin strap that may be coupled to the first side region of the protective head covering and may be extending across a front region of the protective head covering. The helmet may include an anchor that may be protruding from the second side region of the protective head covering and may include an enlarged anchor head. The helmet may include a buckle that may be coupled to the chin strap, and may be selectably coupleable to the anchor. The buckle may include a housing that may have a pair of strap slits. The pair of slits may each include a set of gripping teeth that may be disposed on a side of the slit. The set of gripping teeth of the pair of slits may be oriented so as to be facing oppositely from each other. The housing may includes a first end and a second end each may be extending from the housing at an angle and may be configured to assist in coupling and removing of the buckle from the anchor. The pair of slits may be disposed about the first end and the second end. The housing may include a cavity that may be disposed in the housing and may be sized to contain the enlarged anchor head. The housing may also include a retaining slot that may be disposed through the housing and may include a retaining region that may be sized to securely couple to the enlarged anchor head. The retaining slot may include a receiving region that may be in functional communication with the retaining region and may be sized larger than the enlarged anchor head. The receiving region may be disposed at a position closer to the front region of the helmet than the retaining region when the buckle is coupled to the anchor. The retaining region may be sized and shaped substantially smaller than the anchor. The helmet may include a securement member that may be disposed about the retaining slot and may be configured to be disposed over the anchor when the buckle is coupled thereto. The helmet may further include a second anchor and a second buckle that may be disposed on the first side region and may be configured to couple together.

There is shown a helmet 10 including a protective head covering 12 having a second side region 16 and a chin strap 18 coupled thereto bya buckle coupled to an anchor. The illustrated helmet 10 is configured to protect a head of a player or wearer during physical contact with other players or wearers. The illustrated helmet 10 is a football helmet configured to protect a head of a football player playing American football. The helmet 10 may vary in size, shape, design, configuration, length, height, width, etc. and still perform its intended function. The helmet 10 includes a protective head covering 12 configured to protect a head of a wearer. The protective head covering 12 is configured to completely cover a head of a wearer. The protective head covering 12 includes a first side region and a second side region 16. The helmet 10 includes a chin strap 18 coupled to a first side region of the protective head covering 12 extending across a front region 20 of the protective head covering 12. The chin strap 18 is selectably coupleable to the second side region 16 of the protective head covering 12. The helmet 10 includes a buckle 26 coupled to the chin strap 18, and is selectably coupleable to an anchor disposed on the second side region 16 of the protective head covering 12. The buckle 26 includes a housing coupled to the chin strap 18 and configured to securely couple the chin strap 18 to the protective head covering 12, and thereby securely coupling the helmet 10 to a wearer's head. In operation, a user pulls the chin strap across the front of their face while their head is disposed within the helmet. The buckle attached near and end of the chin strap is pulled so that its aperture may fit over the top of the anchor coupled to the helmet. Generally, this position will be slightly tighter for the user than desired during use of the helmet, but is quickly reduced because once the anchor is disposed through the aperture, the buckle then is able to slide forward to a locked position wherein the anchor is wedged in place within a slot that is sized smaller than the aperture. The buckle also includes structure that prevents the anchor and buckle from substantially moving in relation to each other (other than minor rotation of the buckle about the anchor, wherein the anchor and buckle are shaped to permit the same) while the anchor is locked/wedged in a locked configuration. In one non-limiting example, there is a buckle system of a helmet which operates by sliding a buckle onto an anchor coupled to a helmet which prevents the chin strap from being unbuckled during play. It also provides the ease of removal when the player is ready to take his/her helmet off. There is a strap that is connected to a helmet at one end and a sliding buckle at the other. The sliding buckle connects to an anchor placed generally where typical helmets would include a snap. The anchor is generally screwed to the helmet, or otherwise securely fastened thereto and/or extending therefrom. The snap has an extra lip that operates to hold the buckle in place by a grommet on the buckle. The buckle includes strap apertures that have two sets of teeth are pointed in the opposite direction in order to secure the buckle in both directions along the body of the strap. When the user desires to remove the helmet, the chin strap may be pulled tight again to cause the anchor and buckle to slide in relation to one another such that the anchor may exit the aperture. Once the anchor exits the aperture, the user may pull the chin strap away from the face and then remove the helmet. Advantageously, the helmet with the improved buckle helps to prevent head injuries that are caused when chin straps unsnap, thus allowing the helmet to be dislodged from the player while playing the game. However, it still allows for easy removal of the helmet and generates a self-tightening structure, such that the typical forces applied against the buckle/anchor during play will tend to enhance the coupling instead of tending to dislodge the coupling. In one non-limiting example, there may be two buckles on a chin strap that each couple to the helmet at opposite sides to opposite anchors, respectively coupled to and/or extending from opposite sides of the helmet. In such an example, FIGS. 1 and 2 would illustrate a helmet and the unseen side of each would simply be a mirror image of what is shown. FIG. 2 is a side elevational view of a helmet, according to one embodiment of the invention. There is shown a helmet 10 including a protective head covering 12 having a second side region 16, a chin strap 18, an anchor 22, and a buckle 26. In this illustration, the buckle and anchor are uncoupled. The helmet 10 includes a protective head covering 12 configured to protect a head of a wearer. The protective head covering 12 is configured to completely cover a head of a wearer. The protective head covering 12 includes a first side region and a second side region 16. The helmet 10 includes a chin strap 18 coupled to a first side region of the protective head covering 12 extending across a front region 20 of the protective head covering 12. The chin strap 18 is selectably coupleable to the second side region 16 of the protective head covering 12. The helmet 10 includes a buckle 26 coupled to the chin strap 18, and is selectably coupleable to an anchor 22 disposed on the second side region 16 of the protective head covering 12.

The scope of the invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be embraced within their scope. For example, although the anchor is illustrated as having a circular face and circular flange shape, other non-circular shapes are possible and may be used in combination with buckle apertures and slots of shapes that may be circular/rectangular as illustrated or may be otherwise shaped to match and provide the functionality described herein. Additionally, although the figures illustrate rivets, screws, and similar methods of securely fastening objects together, it is understood that there are a great variety of methods of securely coupling structures together and that such โpermanentโ coupling structures/devices and the like a plethoric and for purposes of this invention are all contemplated as being able to be used herein. It is expected that there could be numerous variations of the design of this invention. An example is that the exact illustrated buckle teeth may vary a great deal in shape, size, number and exact location while still falling within the bounds of the description of the various embodiments described herein. Finally, it is envisioned that the components of the device may be constructed of a variety of materials, including but not limited to metal, ceramic, rubber, plastic, Teflon, woven fibers, natural fibers, artificial fibers, resins, composites thereof and the like. Thus, while the present invention has been fully described above with particularity and detail in connection with what is presently deemed to be the most practical and preferred embodiment of the invention, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications, including, but not limited to, variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use may be made, without departing from the principles and concepts of the invention as set forth in the claims.
