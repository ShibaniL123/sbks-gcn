Step 3. 3-(8-Amino-6-bromoimidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-3-yl)-N-(trans-4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide
A mixture of 6-bromo-3-iodoimidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-8-amine (Example 16, Step 2, 0.20 g, 0.59 mmol), N-(trans-4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-4-methyl-3-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide (Example 1, Step 2, 0.26 g, 0.65 mmol), tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (45 mg, 0.039 mmol), ethanol (8 mL, 100 mmol), and 2.0 M Na2CO3 in water (0.59 mL, 1.2 mmol) was degassed for 5 min with N2. The reaction mixture was then heated at 130° C. for 20 min in a microwave. The reaction mixture was diluted with DCM and water. The biphasic mixture was filtered through a plug of Celite. The organic layer was removed from the filtrate, and the aqueous layer was extracted with DCM (2×). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated. Purification via silica gel chromatography (1-20% MeOH in DCM) afforded a white solid (0.12 g, 42%). LCMS for C19H22BrN5O3S (M+H)+: calculated m/z=480.1, 482.1; found 480.0, 482.0.
