NEW BACITRACIN ANTIBIOTICS Field of invention The present invention relates to new compounds with antibiotic activity. Background of invention A group of closely related peptide antibiotics naturally produced by Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis are called Bacitracins. Bacitracins are generally active against many Gram positive and a few Gram negative bacteria species. Several Bacitracins have been identified of which Bacitracin A is of primary importance and is highly active (Biochemistry, vol. 39 no 14, 2000, page 4037-45 by Epperson and Ming). Bacitracin A is a branched cyclic dodecapeptidolactam antibiotic that is synthesized via the thiotemplate mechanism of non-ribosomal peptide synthesis (J. Am Chem Soc. vol. 128, 2006, page 10513-10520 by Wagner et αℓ and Eur J Biochem, vol. 192 no. 1, 1990, page 1-15 by Kleinkauf and von Dohren). The primary structure of Bacitracin A is NH2-L-Ilei-L-thiazoline2-L-Leu3-D-Glu4-L-Ile5-L-Lys6-D-Orn7-L-Ile8-D-Phe9-L-Hisio-D-Aspii-L-Asni2-COOH which is cyclized between the c-amino group of L-Lyse and the R-carboxyl group of L-Asnn (J. Am Chem Soc. vol 128 page 10513-10520, 2006 by Wagner et at). Ming et αℓ (Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry, vol. 91, 2002) described Bacitracins as peptide compounds with the following formula: R-L-leu^D-Glu4-i^-L-Lysk-D-Orn7-L-Y^D-Phe9-L-His10-D-Asp11-L-Asn12 ο Υ is lie or Val RECTIFIED SHEET (RULE 91) ISA/EP Notably, Ri and R3 are the N-terminal moieties of active Bacitracins, while R4 and Rs are oxidized N-terminal moieties of less active Bacitracins. R2 is however an inactive stereoisomer. Prior art Ikai et al suggested that the activity of Bacitracins may depend on the hydrophobicity: "Comparison of the MICs and the proposed structures of the minor components suggest that the location of the valine affects the activity of each component in the following decreasing order: N-terminus, the seven membered peptide ring, and the side chain peptide moiety. Because this order is related to the elution order of the minor components on the HPLC, the activity may depend on the hydrophobicity of the respective component." (see Journal of Antibiotics, vol. 48 no. 3, 1995 page 233-242 by Ikai et al). Wagner et al suggested incorporating new heterocycles into Bacitracin A in order to overcome existing limitations for the application of Bacitracin (Journal of the American Chemical Society, vol. 128 no 32, 2006, page 10513-10520). Several non-ribosomally synthesized peptides comprise unusual amino acids. For example cyclosporin A comprises 2(S)-Amino-3(R)-Hydroxy-4(R)-Methyl-6(E)Octenoic acid which is crucial for binding to the intracellular receptor for cyclophilin, and thus for its immunosuppressive activity (Journal of Biological Chemistry, vol. 268 no 35, 1993 by Offenzeller et al). Several uncommon amino acids resembles the structure of Isoleucine: • 2-Amino-5-Methyl-5-Hexenoic acid, a new methionine analog, was isolated from a fermentation broth of Streptomyces (Journal of Antibiotics vol. 32 no. 11, page 1118-1124, 1979 by Takeuchi et al). · 4 methylene-norleucine and 2-aminohept-6-enoic acid are compounds with the formula: C7H13NO2. • 4 methyl-norleucine is an iso leucine derivative which can be incorporated into a recombinant protein. (J Pharm Biomed Anal, vol 31. no. 5, 2003, page 979-987 by Muramatsu et al). • 2-amino-3-methyl-4-pentenoic acid is an unsaturated isoleucine analogue which can be incorporated into proteins (Chembiochem vol. 7 no. 1, 2006, page 83-87 by Mock et al). • The unsaturated norleucines of Amanita solitaria. Chemical and pharmacological studies discloses a 2-Amino-Hex-5-enoic acid (Lloydia vol. 36 no.2, 1973, page 69-73 by Chilton et αΐ). • Beta-methylnorleucine, an antimetabolite produced by Serratia marcescens (J Antibiot, vol. 34 no. 10, 1981 page 1278-82 by Sugiura et al) Summary of the invention This invention concerns new Bacitracin compounds. More specifically it concerns new Bacitracin compounds comprising a hitherto unknown amino acid side chain. In one aspect, the invention provides an isolated compound represented by the formula Ν at least one of Ri, R2 and R3 is -CH=CH2, and wherein Ri, FA and R3 are independently -Η, -CH3, or -CH=CH2, or a salt or hydrate thereof. In another aspect, the invention provides a composition comprising the compound described above. A pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound described above is also provided. In yet another aspect, the invention provides use of the compound described above for the preparation of a medicament for treatment of a bacterial infection. Also provided is use of the compound described above for treatment of a bacterial infection, and a method for the treatment of a bacterial infection comprising administering an effective amount of the compound described above to a subject in need thereof. 688464(Μ (GHMatters) P89737.AU SONIAM 9/09/15 -3a- In a further aspect, the invention provides a method for production of the compound described above by substituting Isoleucine or Valine with 5-Methylene-Isoleucine during in vitro Bacitracin synthesis. In still a further aspect, the invention provides a method of obtaining the compound described above comprising producing the compound described above using a Bacitracin producing strain of Bacillus licheniformis and obtaining the compound by purification. In Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis, without being bound by theory, we speculate that this side chain is resulting from a chemical modification on Bacitracin or from incorporation of a hitherto unknown natural amino acid. The systematic name of an a-amino acid compound comprising the new side chain is 2-amino-3-methyl-5-hexenoic acid and its molecular formula is C7H13NO2. We propose and use the name 5-Methylene-Isoleucine for 2-amino-3-methyl-5-hexenoic acid. Accordingly, the 5-Methylene-Isoleucine side chain has the structure CH(CH3)CH2CH=CH2 Thus, the invention concerns new Bacitracin compounds with antibacterial activity comprising at least one 5 -Methylene-Isoleucine residue. Such Bacitracins comprise at least one side chain of 5-Methylene-Isoleucine. The side chain of 5-Methylene-Isoleucine could be represented: 688464(Μ (GHMatters) P89737.AU SONIAM 9/09/15 The invention concerns Bacitracin compounds with antibacterial activity comprising one or more side chains of 5-Methylene-Isoleucine. The Bacitracins according to the invention comprise at least one 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residue in position 1 and/or 5 and/or 8. Such compounds have the following structure: at least one of Ri, R2 and R3 is -CH=CH2, and wherein Ri, R2 and R3 are independently -Η, -CH3, or -CH=CH2 The structure above should be interpreted as covering Bacitracin A if Ri, R2 and R3 were all -CH3. Accordingly, Bacitracin A would be represented: We propose and use the name Bacitracin J1 for Bacitracins according to the invention comprising a 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residue in position 5. This nomenclature is based on elution order from a Cl 8-column. We propose and use the name Bacitracin J2 for Bacitracins according to the invention comprising a 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residue in position 8. This nomenclature is based on elution order from a Cl 8-column. We propose and use the name Bacitracin J3 for Bacitracins according to the invention comprising a 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residue in position 1. This nomenclature is based on elution order from a Cl 8-column. We propose and use the name Bacitracin Κ1 for Bacitracins according to the invention comprising 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residues in position 5 and 8.

This nomenclature is based on expected elution order from a Cl 8-column. We propose and use the name Bacitracin L for Bacitracins according to the invention comprising 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residues in position 1, 5 and 8. This nomenclature is based on expected elution order from a Cl 8-column. The aspects of the invention may be obtained by the features as set forth in the following description of the invention and/or the appended patent claims. Detailed description of the invention Definitions: "Bacitracins" are peptide compounds comprising the following structure (with amino acid residue numbering in superscript): and wherein R is the side chain of the amino acid residue of Isoleucine, Valine or 5-Methylene-Isoleucine; and wherein Υ and Ζ are independently the amino acid residue of Isoleucine, Valine or 5-Methylene-Isoleucine; and wherein Thz is a Thiazoline ring 2' coupled to X and 4' coupled to the a-carbon in Leu; and wherein Leu is a Leucine amino acid residue Glu is a Glutamine amino acid residue Lys is a Lysine amino acid residue forming peptide bonds with Υ and Orn while its e-amine is coupled to the a-carboxyl group of Asparagine by a peptide bond Orn is an Ornithine amino acid residue Phe is a Phenylalanine amino acid residue His is a Histidine amino acid residue Asp is an Aspartic acid amino acid residue Asn is an Asparagine amino acid residue forming peptide bond with Asp while its a-carboxyl group is coupled to the e-amine of Lysine by a peptide bond; When used in this application; "Bacitracins" is meant to embrace any compound having the structure above regardless of the production method. Thus, the term "Bacitracins" includes the antibiotic compounds naturally produced by Bacillus licheniformis but also in vitro produced compounds (synthetic) and semisynthetic compounds having the primary structure above. "Bacitracins" is also meant to embrace any compound having the structure above regardless of the charge which varies with pH. "Bacitracins" is also meant to embrace any compound having the primary structure above regardless of the stereochemistry. "Bacitracins" is also meant to embrace salts and hydrates of the compounds having the primary structure above. "Bacitracins comprising at least one 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residue" is meant to embrace any Bacitracin comprising the structure that would be generated if a Iso leucine or Valine residue(s) was substituted with 5-Methylene-Iso leucine residue(s) in position 1 and/or 5 and/or 8. "Bacitracins comprising a 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residue" is meant to embrace any Bacitracin displaying the structure that would be generated if an Isoleucine or Valine residue was substituted with 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residue position 1 or 5 or 8. "Bacitracins comprising the side chain of at least one 5-Methylene-Isoleucine" is meant to embrace "Bacitracins comprising at least one 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residue" When the N-terminal amino group and/or the Thiazoline ring of Bacitracins is oxidized, a substantial amount of the antibacterial activity is lost. For example the low activity compound Bacitracin F, comprises a keto-thiazole moiety instead of the amino-thiazoline moiety (J. Org. Chem, vol. 22, 1957, page 1345-1353 by Craig et αℓ). Amino acids in D-configuration are common in non-ribosomally synthesized bacterial peptides and less common in ribosomally synthesized proteins. For example in Bacitracins, the amino acid residues in position 4, 7, 9 and 11 are usually in D-configuration (Glu, Orn, Phe and Asp). 5-Methylene-Isoleucine comprises two chiral carbon atoms which independently could be in R or S configuration. An "Amino acid residue" is the unit in a peptide which comprises -NH-CHR-COOH (C-terminal residue) or NH2-CHR-CO- (N-terminal residue) or -NH-CHR-CO- (internal residue) wherein R is -Η in Glycine, -CH3 in Alanine, -OH in Serine, -CH2SH in Cysteine, -CH(CH3)CH2CH3 in Isoleucine, -CH2CH(CH3)2 in Leucine -CH(CH3)2 in Valine etc. An "Amino acid side chain" is the R-group of an "Amino acid residue". For example, the R-group is -CH(CH3)CH2CH=CH2 in 5-Methylene-Isoleucine -CH(CH3)CH2CH3 in Isoleucine, -CH2CH(CH3)2 in Leucine -CH(CH3)2 in Valine "Antibacterial activity" is any activity which • inhibits the growth, metabolism or reproduction of bacteria, or • increases the mortality of bacteria, or · reduces the pathogenicity of bacteria. Potency is the in vitro antibacterial activity. It can be measurered and expressed as IU/mg. The "positions" of the amino acid residues in Bacitracins are numbered from the Νterminal which can be Isoleucine, Valine or 5-Methylene-Isoleucine in position 1 (the left end in all figures showing Bacitracins in this application). Hence, Lys is in position number 6 and Asn is in position number 12. In Bacitracins, the "position 1" is special, because this amino acid residue is partly incorporated into the Thiazoline ring. Thus the amino acid residue in position 1 in Bacitracins does not comprise the usual N-terminal unit: R 0 I II NH2-C-C- I Η but comprises instead: R I NH2 -C- coupled to Thiazoline or oxidized derivatives thereof. I Η A "composition" is any mixture comprising more than two different compounds. For example, a mixture of two active pharmaceutical ingredients, or a mixture of an active pharmaceutical ingredient and one or more pharmaceutical excipients. The term "component" or "components" used in this application is referring to a specific compound in a composition. Accordingly, "Minor components" are compounds found in relatively small amounts in a composition. A "pharmaceutical composition" is any composition suitable for use in vivo. Such compositions can thus be administered cutaneously, subcutaneously, intravenously, parenterally, orally etc. The invention concerns new Bacitracin compounds comprising the side chain of at least one 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residue. More specifically, the invention concerns new Bacitracin compounds with antibacterial activity comprising at least one 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residue. Even more specifically it concerns new Bacitracin compounds with improved antibacterial activity comprising at least one 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residue(s) in position 1 or 5 or 8. Even more specifically, it concerns new Bacitracin compounds with antibacterial activity comprising one 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residue in position 1 or 5 or 8. The invention also concerns new Bacitracin compounds with antibacterial activity comprising two 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residues in position 1 and 5. The invention also concerns new Bacitracin compounds with antibacterial activity comprising two 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residues in position 1 and 8. The invention also concerns new Bacitracin compounds with antibacterial activity comprising two 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residues in position 5 and 8. The invention also concerns new Bacitracin compounds with antibacterial activity comprising three 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residues in position 1 and 5 and 8. The Bacitracins comprising at least one 5-Methylene-Isoleucine residue in position 1, 5 or 8 can be used for inhibiting unwanted bacterial growth both in vitro and in vivo. These compounds can thus have therapeutic effect if administered to an animal or a human with a bacterial infection. When 5-Methylene-Isoleucine is incorporated in Bacitracins at position 1, 5 or 8, the resulting amino acid side chain is unsaturated and comprises 5 carbon atoms. The side chains of Isoleucine and Valine residues comprise 4 or 3 carbon atoms, respectively. The elution order from a Cl 8-column is Bacitracin A, Bacitracin Jl, Bacitracin J2 and Bacitracin J3 (see Chromatograms in Figure 1). Thus it is reasonable that substitution of a Isoleucine side chain with the 5-Methylene-Isoleucine side chain results in more hydrophobic Bacitracins.

The samples were dissolved in water to concentration 2 mg/ml and were then filtered through 0.45 pm filters (VWR) before LC-MSn analysis. The Surveyor HPLC system (Thermo Fisher) consisted of a quarternary pump, degasser, thermostated autosampler (set to 5 °C), thermostated column compartment (set to 30 °C) and a diode-array detector (set to 254 nm). The HPLC conditions were the same as described in Govaerts et αℓ (Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry, vol. 17, no 12, page 1366-1379). An YMC-Pack Pro C18-column (5 pm, 250 χ 2.0 mm) was used. The mobile phase consisted of methanol/acetonitrile/0.1 Μ ammonium acetate pH 6.0/water 58:5:10:27, ν/ν/ν/ν. The 0.1 Μ ammonium acetate solution was adjusted to pH 6.0 by adding 0.1 Μ acetic acid. Isocratic conditions was used at the flow rate 0.2 ml/min. The injection volume was 10 pi. An LXQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) equipped with an ESI interface was connected to the HPLC system. Tuning was performed on the doubly protonated molecular ion ([M+2H]2+) of Bacitracin A. The ESI parameters were set as follows: sheath gas 35 (arbitrary units), auxiliary gas 10 (arbitrary units), spray voltage 5.0 kV, capillary temperature 320 °C, capillary voltage 9.0 V, tube lens voltage 95 V. The MS parameters were set as follows: RF lens offset -4.25 V, lens 0 voltage -3.0 V, multipole 0 offset -4.5 V, lens 1 voltage 8.0 V, gate lens voltage -56 V, multipole 1 offset -9.5 V, multipole RF amplitude 400 V, front lens voltage -6.5 V. LC-MS/MS- and LC-MS3-analyses were performed with isolation widths 3 and collision energies 16%. Results The UV- and MS-chromatograms of a typical lot (ΒΑΝΝ 211412) from Axellia Pharmaceuticals are shown in Figure 1Α-Β. The UV-chromatogram is very similar to the corresponding chromatogram of this lot using the LC-MS incompatible Ph.Eur. HPLC method. Except for Bacitracin A, three minor components denoted Bacitracin Jl, Bacitracin J2 and Bacitracin J3, all with molecular weights 12 Da more than Bacitracin A, are marked in Figure 1. The structural elucidation of these three components will be described in this application and their structure will give the rationale for their denotations. Bacitracin A The doubly protonated molecular ion ([M+2H]2+, m/z 712.0) was isolated and fragmented and the resulting product ion (MS/MS) spectrum is shown in Figure 2Β. The spectrum contains a full set of y” ions with m/z 1337.7/669.82+ (loss of lie), m/z 1224.7/613.12+ (loss oflleThz), m/z 1111.7 (loss of IleThzLeu), m/z 982.6/492.22+ (loss of IleThzLeuGlu) and m/z 869.6 (loss of IleThzLeuGluIle). These fragment assignments are visualized in Figure 2Α. In addition to the b ions with m/z 554.5 (IleThzLeuGluIle) and m/z 441.3 (IleThzLeuGlu), fragment ions resulting from pairs of bond cleavages can be seen at m/z 227.1 (ThzLeu), m/z 356.1 (ThzLeuGlu) and at m/z 469.2 (ThzLeuGluIle). Sequencing of the cyclic part of Bacitracin A was performed by further isolating and fragmenting the ring part fragment ion at m/z 869.6 in a MS3 experiment (712.0->869.6), see Figure 3Β. The preferential ring opening between Orn and lie results in two series of fragment ions shown in Figure 3Α. One series comprises the product ions at m/z 756.5 (loss of He), m/z 609.4 (loss of IlePhe), m/z 472.4 (loss of IlePheHis) and at m/z 357.4 (loss of IlePheHisAsp). In the other series, product ions at m/z 755.6 (loss of Orn), m/z 627.4 (loss of OrnLys), m/z 513.4 (loss of OrnLysAsn) and at m/z 398.4 (loss of OrnLysAsnAsp) are found. All these fragment ions thus confirms the well-established sequence of Bacitracin A and presents a possibility to elucidate the sequence of unknown Bacitracin analogues by fragmentation pattern comparisons. Bacitracin J1 Using the same methodology as for Bacitracin A, the location of a modification responsible for the +12 Da difference from Bacitracin A, could be determined. The doubly protonated molecular ion ([M+2H]2+, m/z 718.0) was isolated and fragmented and the resulting product ion (MS/MS) spectrum is shown in Figure 4Β. The spectrum contains a full set of y” ions with m/z 1349.7/675.82+ (loss of He), m/z 1236.7/619.12+ (loss oflleThz), m/z 1123.7 (loss of IleThzLeu), m/z 994.6/498.12+ (loss of IleThzLeuGlu) and m/z 869.6 (loss of IleThzLeuGluMil). These fragment assignments are visualized in Figure 4Α. In addition to the b ions with m/z 566.4 (IleThzLeuGluMil) and m/z 441.3 (IleThzLeuGlu), fragment ions resulting from pairs of bond cleavages can be seen at m/z 227.1 (ThzLeu), m/z 356.1 (ThzLeuGlu) and at m/z 481.2 (ThzLeuGluMil). An LC-MS3 experiment (718.0->869.6) gave the same characteristic fragment ions as for the corresponding experiment on the cyclic part of Bacitracin A. All these fragment ions are thus consistent with a residue weighing 12 Da more than He at position 5 in this component, while the rest of the sequence seems to be identical to Bacitracin A:s. Bacitracin J2 Using the same methodology as for Bacitracin A, the location of a modification responsible for the +12 Da difference from Bacitracin A, could be determined. The doubly protonated molecular ion ([M+2H]2+, m/z 718.0) was isolated and fragmented and the resulting product ion (MS/MS) spectrum is shown in Figure 5Β. The spectrum contains a full set of y” ions with m/z 1349.7/675.82+ (loss of lie), m/z 1236.7/619.22+ (loss oflleThz), m/z 1123.7 (loss of IleThzLeu), m/z 994.6/498.12+ (loss of IleThzLeuGlu) and m/z 881.6 (loss of IleThzLeuGluIle). These fragment assignments are visualized in Figure 5Α. In addition to the b ions with m/z 554.4 (IleThzLeuGluIle) and m/z 441.3 (IleThzLeuGlu), fragment ions resulting from pairs of bond cleavages can be seen at m/z 227.1 (ThzLeu), m/z 356.1 (ThzLeuGlu) and at m/z 469.2 (ThzLeuGluIle). From these fragments it is obvious that the +12 Da modification from Bacitracin A is located in the ring portion of the molecule. Sequencing of the cyclic part of Bacitracin J2 was performed by further isolating and fragmenting the ring part fragment ion at m/z 881.6 in a MS3 experiment (718.0->881.6), see Figure 6Β. The preferential ring opening between Orn and lie results in two series of fragment ions shown in Figure 6Α. One series comprises the product ions at m/z 756.4 (loss of Mil), m/z 609.5 (loss of MilPhe), m/z 472.4 (loss of MilPheHis) and at m/z 357.4 (loss of MilPheHisAsp). In the other series, product ions at m/z 767 A (loss of Orn), m/z 639.4 (loss of OrnLys), m/z 525.4 (loss of OrnLysAsn) and at m/z 410.4 (loss of OrnLysAsnAsp) are found. All these fragment ions are thus consistent with a residue weighing 12 Da more than He at position 8 in this component, while the rest of the sequence seems to be identical to Bacitracin A. Bacitracin J3 Using the same methodology as for Bacitracin A, the location of a modification responsible for the +12 Da difference from Bacitracin A, could be determined. The doubly protonated molecular ion ([M+2H]2+, m/z 718.0) was isolated and fragmented and the resulting product ion (MS/MS) spectrum is shown in Figure 7Β. The spectrum contains a full set of y” ions with m/z 1337.8/669.82+ (loss of Mil), m/z 1224.8/613.22+ (loss of (MilThz), m/z 1111.7 (loss of MilThzLeu), m/z 982.6/492.22+ (loss of MilThzLeuGlu) and m/z 869.6 (loss of MilThzLeuGluIle). These fragment assignments are visualized in Figure 7Α. In addition to the b ions with m/z 566.4 (MilThzLeuGluIle) and m/z 453.4 (MilThzLeuGlu), fragment ions resulting from pairs of bond cleavages can be seen at m/z 227.1 (ThzLeu), m/z 356.1 (ThzLeuGlu) and at m/z 469.2 (ThzLeuGluIle). An LC-MS3 experiment (718.0->869.6) gave the same characteristic fragment ions as for the corresponding experiment on the cyclic part of Bacitracin A. All these fragment ions are thus consistent with a residue weighing 12 Da more than He at position 1 in this component, while the rest of the sequence seems to be identical to Bacitracin A:s. Experiment 2: Isolating the components In order to elucidate the structures of the three components with NMR spectroscopy, enriched samples had to be prepared. Ideally, each of the three components should be isolated to about 90% purity to obtain “clean” NMR spectra, free from interfering signals from other components. The isolation was done in two steps. In the first step, a LiChroprep RP-18-column (25-40 pm, 35 χ 5 cm) was used to remove the components eluting before and after the three components. The mobile phase consisted of methanol/acetonitrile/0.03 Μ ammonium formate pH 6.0 3.5:31.5:65, ν/ν/ν. In this way, purified material with a total purity of about 25 % for the three components was obtained. In the second step, an YMC-Pack ODS-Acolumn (5 pm, 250 χ 10 mm) was used to separate the three components from each other. The mobile phase consisted of methanol/acetonitrile/0.025 Μ ammonium acetate pH 6.0 58:5:37, ν/ν/ν. The final result of this 2-step purification were 4 samples (denoted samples Β, B’, C and C’), where samples Β and B’ were similar and contained mainly Bacitracin J1 and Bacitracin A, and where samples C and C’ were similar and contained mainly Bacitracin J2 and Bacitracin J3 (Table 1). LC-MSn was performed on all samples in order to verify that the right components had been isolated. The purity of samples Β and C was much lower than what usually is thought to be necessary for full NMR elucidation. However, as the other main component in sample Β was Bacitracin A, it was decided to try an NMR investigation without further purification. By first performing NMR investigation on a sample with enriched content of Bacitracin A (denoted sample A, earlier prepared), it was hoped that in addition to serve as a reference compound, the signals from Bacitracin A could be omitted from the spectra of sample Β. As sample C contained a mixture of Bacitracin J2 and Bacitracin J3, full structural elucidation could not be expected due to an anticipated high degree of overlapping signals. However, as the modifications in these components were expected to be the same as in Bacitracin J1 (from LC-MSn trials, see Experiment 1), it was still hoped that the NMR experiments in combination with the results from LC-MSn, would give sufficient structural evidence.

The molecular weight difference between Bacitracin Jl/Bacitracin A was 11.9998. The molecular weight differences between both Bacitracin J2/Bacitracin A and Bacitracin J3/Bacitracin A were 12.0000, respectively. This gave further evidence that the components Bacitracin Jl, Bacitracin J2 and Bacitracin J3 had elemental compositions consisting of one more carbon atom (exact mass 12.0000) than Bacitracin A.

The experiments were obtained on a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer using standard pulse sequences for two-dimensional homonuclear proton chemical shift correlation (DQF-COSY, TOCSY, NOESY), heteronuclear 'H-^C correlation (HSQC, HMBC) and heteronuclear 'H-^N correlation (HSQC) experiments. Mixing times of 20 ms and 60 ms were used for TOCSY experiments and mixing times of 100 ms, 200 ms, 400 ms and 600 ms were used in the NOESY experiments. For sample C, a ϋΕΡΤ(135) experiment was obtained. Chemical shifts are reported in p.p.m., using internal 2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (0.5 mM) as reference. Results Sample A (Bacitracin A) Identification of the amino acid spin-systems were done by 2D 'H-'H chemical shift correlation experiments (DQF-COSY and TOCSY) and heteronuclear 'H-^C and 'H-^N chemical shift correlation (HSQC) in the 'H detected mode and the data are summarized in Table 3. The chemical shift data are consistent with the presence of residues lie, Thz, Leu, Glu, lie, Lys, Om, He, Phe, His, Asp and Asn both from comparisons of'H chemical shift data in Kobayashi et αℓ. (1992) (see Table 3) and chemical shift statistics found in the BMRB database (see Table 3). The sequence of the amino acid residues was established from 2D 'H-'H (NOESY, Table 4) and 'H-^C (HMBC, Table 5) correlation experiments. The dipolar coupling (through space, NOESY) and long-range scalar coupling (HMBC) were in accordance with the well-established sequence of Bacitracin A: Table 3. 1H, 13C and 1SN chemical shifts for Bacitracin A (in sample A) and Bacitracin J1 (in sample Β). Data was recorded in 95% phosphate buffer pH 6.5 / 5% D2O at 303 Κ. Chemical shifts are reported in p.p.m., using internal 2,2-Dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (0.5 mM) as reference.

The chemical shift data for residues lie, Thz, Leu, Glu, Lys, Orn, lie, Phe, His, Asp and Asn are nearly identical to the corresponding data for Bacitracin A, which indicates that the same residues are found unmodified in the main component of sample Β. Noticeably, the spin-system corresponding to He5 in Bacitracin A was significantly weaker in this sample compared to in sample A (recall that sample Β contained about 20% Bacitracin A). In addition to these signals, a 3Jh,h- coupled spin-system was found with resonances at δ 8.19 (backbone amide proton), 5.72, 5.06, 4.11, 2.10, 1.98, 1.90 and 0.82. HSQC cross-peaks at δ 5.72/138.2, δ 5.06/120.1, δ 4.11/60.8, δ 2.10/38.8, δ 1.90/38.8, δ 1.98/36.7 and at δ 0.82/17.9 indicated at least six CHx-groups. COSY cross-peaks at δ 8.19/4.11, δ 4.11/1.98, δ 1.98/0.82 and HMBC cross-peaks at δ 8.19/60.8, δ 4.11/175.7, δ 4.11/36.7, δ 4.11/17.9, δ 0.82/60.8 and at δ 0.82/36.7 evidenced the following element -NHCH(CO)CHCH3, which also was supported by the expected NOE correlations. COSY cross-peaks at δ 2.10/1.90 and HMBC cross-peaks at δ 4.11/38.8, δ 0.82/38.8, δ 1.90/36.7 and at δ 1.90/17.9 evidenced the following element NHCH(CO)CH(CH3)CH2, which also was supported by the expected NOE correlations. COSY cross-peaks at δ 5.72/2.10, δ 5.72/1.90, δ 5.72/5.06 and HMBC cross-peaks at δ 5.72/38.8, δ 1.90/138.2, δ 5.06/38.8 and at δ 1.90/120.1 evidenced the following novel element -NHCH(CO)CH(CH3)CH2CH=CH2, which also was supported by the expected NOE correlations. All chemical shift data for this unusual amino acid-analogue to He are similar to predicted data generated by ChemDraw (data not shown). The sequence of the amino acid residues was established from 2D 'H-'H (NOESY, Table 4) and 'H-^C (HMBC, Table 5) correlation experiments. The amino acid sequence was found to be the same as in Bacitracin A, where the unusual Ileanalogue (called 5-Methylene-Isoleucine) replaces He at position 5. NMR data are thus in accordance with the results from LC-MSn and accurate mass determination, where all data indicates the presence of the following Bacitracin A-analogue in sample A: Structure 2. Bacitracin Jl. Sample C (Bacitracin J2 and Bacitracin J3) NMR data evidenced the presence of two residues of the same unusual lie-analogue that was present in sample Β (see Table 6). In addition to the 2D experiments that were acquired for samples A and Β, a DEPT(135) experiment was also performed on sample C (Table 6). This experiment further verified the structure of the two unusual and identical amino acid-analogues to lie in sample C. One of these Ileanalogues was situated at the N-terminal (as indicated by its lack of visible backbone amide proton), and was correspondingly denoted 5-Methylene- Iso leucine1. The other lie-analogue was situated at position 8, as evidenced by NOESY and HMBC correlations, and was therefore denoted 5-Methylene-Isoleucine8. NMR data are thus in accordance with the results from LC-MSn and accurate mass determination. All the data indicates the presence of two Bacitracin A-analogues in sample C, where the unusual lie-analogue replaces lie at position 8 in one Bacitracin A-analogue, and where the unusual lie-analogue replaces lie at position 1 in the second Bacitracin A-analogue: Mil1- Thz 2-Leu3-Glu4-Ile5-Lys6-Orn7-Ile8-Phe9-His10-Asp11-Asn12 Table 6. 1H, 13C and 1SN chemical shifts and DEPT(135)-data for Bacitracin J2 and Bacitracin J3 (in sample C).

The specific antibacterial activity (listed here as IU/mg), often termed potency, was measured by comparing the antibacterial activity of the unknown sample with known (standard) samples. Specifically, a Bacitracin Zinc standard was dissolved and diluted to 2.0, 1.0, and 0.5 IU bacitracin/ml in 0,07 Μ phosphate buffer pH 6.0. These three standard solutions were added to agar plates inoculated with the test organism, Micrococcus luteus. The unknown samples were dissolved, diluted and added to the same plate as the standards. After 16-24 hours at 32-37 C, the inhibition zones were measured and the unknown samples were compared to the standards. The results (reported as IU/mg) of each sample is listed in Table 7. Table 7 Potency (specific antibacterial activity, IU/mg) of the isolated samples. Test organism: Micrococcus luteus. Sample Potency (JU/rog) A 72 : W υ c m The sample A contained, as listed in Table 1, 93% (measured with HPLC at 254 nm) Bacitracin A (and no Bacitracin Jl, J2 or J3). The specific antibacterial activity of Bacitracin A can then be calculated to 77.4 IU/mg. This is lower than earlier reported. Possible explanations could be water or salt content, as well as possible antagonistic effects of minor components. As samples B' and C' contain mixtures of several Bacitracins, it is not possible to report an exact specific antimicrobial activity (IU/mg) of the Bacitracin Jl, J2 or J3. However, the available data strongly indicates potencies of Bacitracin Jl, J2 and J3 being similar or above that of Bacitracin A. Also samples B' and C' could contain water, salt and/or components having synergistic or antagonostic effects.
