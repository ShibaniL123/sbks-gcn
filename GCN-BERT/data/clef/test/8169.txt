IMMUNOSUPPRESSANT FORMULATION Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a dosage form of siponimod (BAF312) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, wherein the dosage form is preferably obtainable by a specific blending process or comprises a specific amounts of compounds. Further, the present invention relates to a method for producing the dosage form and the use of agglomerates comprising siponimod and moisture protective agent for producing a storage -stable dosage form. Background Siponimod (BAF312) is a sphingosine-1 -phosphate (S IP) receptor modulator. S IP receptors belong to a family of closely related, lipid activated G-protein coupled receptors. S 1P1, S 1P3, S1P2, S 1P4, and S 1P5 (also respectively termed EDG-1, EDG- 3, EDG-5, EDG-6 and EDG-8) are identified as receptors specific for SIP. Certain S IP receptors are associated with diseases mediated by lymphocyte interactions, for example in transplantation rejection, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, infectious diseases and cancer. WO 2012/093161 Al discloses a solid phase pharmaceutical composition comprising 1- {4-[l-(4-cyclohexyl-3-trifluoromethyl-benzyloxyimino)-ethyl]-2-ethyl-benzyl}- azetidine-3-carboxylic acid (BAF312, siponimod) or a pharmacologically acceptable salt, solvate or hydrate thereof, wherein the API is not exposed to a basic compound. Due to the non-exposure to basic compounds, the stability of siponimod in the composition can be increased. However, there is still a need of further enhancing the stability of siponimod in pharmaceutical applications. Thus, it is an object of the present invention to provide a dosage form, preferably a tablet, which stabilizes the contained siponimod, so that the active pharmacological ingredient is provided even after a prolonged storage period. Further, a dosage form having an advantageous content uniformity should be provided. Summary of the Invention According to the present invention, the above objective is unexpectedly overcome by a dosage form, obtained by a process comprising the steps described in this invention. Furthermore, the above drawbacks can be overcome by a specific process for preparing a dosage form comprising siponimod by pre-blending the active pharmacological ingredient with a moisture-protective agent. Thus, the subject of the present invention is a dosage form, obtainable by a process comprising the steps providing siponimod, ii) pre-blending the compound of step i) with moisture protective agent and, optionally, pharmaceutical excipient, iii) blending the mixture of step ii) with pharmaceutical excipient(s), iv) processing the mixture of step iii) to a dosage form, v) optionally, film-coating the dosage form. It was unexpectedly found that in the dosage form of the present invention siponimod is stabilized. At the same time, the process of dosage form formation is facilitated due to the pre-blending of siponimod with a moisture-protective agent, as the compressibility of the mixture is surprisingly increased. Further, the invention relates to a dosage form containing 0.2 to 12% (w/w) siponimod, 1 to 8% (w/w) of moisture-protective agent and 80 to 98.8 % (w/w) of pharmaceutical excipient(s). Further, the invention relates to a process for producing a dosage form comprising the steps i) providing siponimod, ii) pre-blending the compound of step i) with moisture-protective agent and, optionally, pharmaceutical excipient, iii) blending the mixture of step ii) with pharmaceutical excipient(s), iv) processing the mixture of step iii) to a dosage form, v) optionally, film-coating the dosage form. Further, the invention relates to the use of agglomerates comprising siponimod and moisture protective agent for producing a solid oral dosage form having a shelf life of at least 2 years at room temperature, i.e. 25 °C. Preferably, the agglomerates can be prepared as described below, e.g. by blending of siponimod and moisture protective agent.

"Siponimod" as used herein is understood to comprise the compound of formula (I) as well as the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, polymorphs, solvates and/or hydrates thereof. Siponimod as used herein has the IUPAC-name l-{4-[l-((£)-4-cyclohexyl-3- trifluoromethyl-benzyloxyimino)-ethyl]-2-ethyl-benzyl}-azetidine-3-carboxylic acid (BAF312). In a preferred embodiment of the invention, siponimod is present in the form of crystalline siponimod or siponimod salt. In a most preferred embodiment of the invention siponimod is present as crystalline siponimod hemifumarate. The term "crystalline" can be used in the context of this invention to describe the state of a solid substance, whose constituent atoms, molecules, or ions are arranged in an ordered pattern extending in all three spatial dimensions. The siponimod in the pharmaceutical composition form of the invention may consist of purely crystalline siponimod. Alternatively, it may also contain small amounts of noncrystalline siponimod components. In an embodiment of the invention, the siponimod contained in the inventive dosage form can be 85 to 99.999 %, more preferably 90 to 99.99 %, most preferably 95 to 99.9 % by weight crystalline siponimod. In a preferred embodiment, the dosage form of the present invention is a solid oral dosage form, preferably a capsule or tablet, in particular, a tablet. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the dosage form of the invention comprises siponimod as the sole pharmaceutically active agent. In step i) according to the present invention, siponimod is provided. As described above, siponimod can be provided as a free base, as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, polymorph, as solvate or hydrate thereof. In a preferred embodiment it is provided as siponimod hemifumarate. Further, siponimod is preferably provided in particulate form. Siponimod is preferably provided in an amount of 0.2 to 12 wt.%, preferably 1.3 to 12 wt.%, more preferably 1.3 to 3.0 wt.%, especially 2.0 to 2.7 wt.% siponimod, based on the total weight of the dosage form. Generally, the amounts of the components of the dosage form of the present invention given in wt.% are preferably referred to the dosage form without film coating. Further, siponimod is preferably provided in an amount of 0.1 to 10 mg preferably 0.2 to 5 mg, in particular, 1 or 2 mg, based on the amount of siponimod in form of the free base. In particular, the dosage form of the present invention comprises 2 mg siponimod. Since the active agent can be present in the form of a salt, the amount of the respective acid has to be added accordingly. The siponimod comprised in the dosage form of the present invention can preferably have an average particle size X90 of 5 to 100 μιη, more preferably 15 to 80 μιη, even more preferably 30 to 70 μιη, most preferably 40 to 50 μιη. The particle size X90, which is also denoted as X90 value of the integral volume distribution, is defined in the context of this invention as the particle diameter at which 90 per cent by volume of the particles have a smaller diameter than the diameter which corresponds to the X90 value. Likewise, 10 per cent by volume of the particles have a larger diameter than the X90 value. The X10 and X50 values are defined accordingly. Further, the siponimod comprised in the dosage form of the present invention can preferably have an average particle size X50 of 1 to 25 μπι, more preferably 2 to 22 μπι, even more preferably 4 to 20 μπι, especially preferred 5 to 17 μπι. Yet further, the siponimod comprised in the dosage form of the present invention can preferably have a particle size X10 of 0.5 to 5 μπι, more preferably 1 to 4 μπι, even more preferably 1.2 to 3 μπι, especially preferably 1.5 to 2.7 μπι. In a preferred embodiment the ratio X90/X50 can be 1.0 to 100, preferably 1.2 to 10, more preferably 2.0 to 5.0, most preferably 2.5 to 4.0 In a preferred embodiment the ratio X50/X10 can be 1.1 to 10, preferably 1.2 to 5, more preferably 2.5 to 4.0. The particle size distribution by volume can be measured by using laser diffractrometry. In particular, it can be measured by using the Sympatec Helos device (from Sympatec GmbH, Germany), using the Cuvette dispersion device. To carry out the measurement, a stock dispersion was prepared by mixing the drug substance with a dispersing aid (Octastat® 5000 (Octel corp)), using a vortex until a smooth and homogeneous paste was formed. The paste was then diluted and mixed to a final volume of 3 to 6 ml using white spirit. The optical concentration of the final solution was kept below 5%. The percentage values were calculated from the mean cumulative volume size curve by the software of the Sympatec instrument. The particulate siponimod can be obtained by milling, such as wet-jet milling, pin- milling, wet-ball milling. Where the siponimod particles are derived from coarse siponimod particle crystals, the coarse crystals may be obtained e.g. by methodologies set out in WO2010/071794, WO2010/08045 or WO2010/080409. In step ii) of the present invention, siponimod is pre-blended with moisture protective agent and, optionally, pharmaceutical excipient, e.g. a filler. The feature "pre-blending" can refer to mixing solid and/or particulate siponimod with solid and/or particulate moisture protective agent, e.g. in devices as described below. Preferably, the pre- blending leads to agglomerates comprising siponimod and moisture protective agents. It has been unexpectedly found that these agglomerates provide advantageous storage properties, i.e. they can be used for providing storage-stable dosage forms of siponimod. In one embodiment, the pre-blending with a moisture protective agent does not lead to a controlled release-type formulation of siponimod. Generally, the moisture protective agent is a pharmaceutical excipient, capable of adhering to the siponimod particles and of protecting them from moisture during the subsequent process steps. "Adhering" as used herein has to be understood in a broad sense. The term may encompass the adsorption or agglomeration of particles. It also may encompass the agglomeration of particles of different size, i.e. larger particles of moisture protective agent and/or filler agglomerate with smaller particles of siponimod. In one embodiment of the invention, the moisture protective agent is a hydrophobic compound or a compound comprising a hydrophobic residue. In a preferred embodiment, the moisture protective agent is a compound, preferably a pharmaceutical excipient, having a n-octanol/water partition coefficient (log P) of 0.1 to 20, preferably 1 to 15, more preferably of 5 to 13, in particular, 6 to 12, especially 7 to 11. The preferred method of log P determination is the shake-flask method, which consists of adding 1 g of moisture protective agent to a volume of 10 ml n-octanol and 10 ml distilled water, respectively, at 25 °C. Subsequently, the dissolved concentration of the solute in each solvent is measured by UV/VIS spectroscopy. The partition coefficient is the ratio of concentrations of un-ionized solute (moisture protective agent) between the two solutions. The logarithm of the ratio of the concentrations in the solvents is called log P. Further, the moisture protective agent can be a waxy compound. Waxy compounds can be organic materials, e.g. with a molecular weight of 100 to 2000 g/mol. Waxy compounds are preferably solid at room temperature, i.e. 25 °C, more preferably having a melting point of 35° C to 120 °C, more preferably of 45 to 80 °C. Further, waxy compounds as used herein preferably consist of or comprise hydrophobic compounds that are malleable at 25 °C.

Examples of waxy compounds are natural waxes such as beeswax, lanolin, Carnauba wax containing myricyl cerotate, castor wax, candelilla wax, ouricury wax, sugar cane wax, retamo wax and tallow. Waxy compounds can also comprise mono-, di- and triesters of glycerin and fatty acids such as behenic, oleic, stearic, palmitoleic, arachidic, palmitic, lauric, myristic and ricinoleic acid, as well as phospholipids. Di- and triesters of glycerin and fatty acids can comprise up to two and three different fatty acids, respectively. In a preferred embodiment, the moisture protective agent has a saponification value of from 10 to 250, preferably from 50 to 220, more preferably from 100 to 200, still more preferably from 125 to 185. The saponification value can be measured according to ASTM D5558. In a preferred embodiment, the moisture protective agent is selected from the group consisting of hydrogenated vegetable oil, castor oil, palmitol stearate, glyceryl palmitostearate and glyceryl behenate. a most preferred embodiment, the moisture protective agent is glyceryl behenate. "Glyceryl behenate" usually is a mixture of glyceryl esters of behenic acid made from glycerin and behenic acid. Preferably, glyceryl behenate as used in the present invention comprises 10 to 20 percent monoglyceride, 47 to 59 percent diglyceride, 26 to 38 percent triglyceride, and not more than 2.5 percent free behenic acid.

In one embodiment of the invention, siponimod is pre-blended in step ii) with a moisture protective agent and a filler. Fillers, which are sometimes also called "bulking agents" or "diluents", add volume and/or mass to a drug substance, thereby facilitating precise metering and handling in the preparation of dosage forms. Fillers typically also fill out the size of a tablet or capsule, making it practical to produce and convenient for the consumer to use. A good filler should typically be inert, compatible with the other components of the formulation, non-hygroscopic, relatively cheap, compactible, and, preferably, tasteless or with a pleasant tasting. In a preferred embodiment, the filler is referred to as a single filler or to a mixture of several fillers. Examples of fillers are plant cellulose (pure plant filler), hydroxypropyl cellulose, dibasic calcium phosphate, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, sorbitol, calcium carbonate, and magnesium stearate.

In an alternative embodiment, the pre-blending can be conducted such that the siponimod ii) is mixed with a first part of the moisture-protective agent or a mixture of the moisture-protective agent and pharmaceutical excipient in a mixing device, for example in a high shear or diffusion mixer. After this first mixing step, a second part of the moisture-protective agent or a mixture of the moisture-protective agent and pharmaceutical excipient can be added, which is followed by a second mixing step. This procedure can be repeated until the last part of the moisture-protective agent or a mixture of the moisture-protective agent and pharmaceutical excipient is used, preferably one to five times.

It is noted that due to the nature of pharmaceutical excipients it cannot be excluded that a certain compound meets the requirements of more than one of the pharmaceutical excipients disclosed above. In the context of this invention, for the sake of clarity, a substance which is used as a particular excipient preferably is not simultaneously also used as a further pharmaceutical excipient. For example, microcrystalline cellulose - if used as filler - is not also used as, for example, disintegrant, even though microcrystalline cellulose also exhibits a certain disintegrating effect. To this general rule one exception applies: an excipient being used as moisture protective agent may also be used as lubricant (preferably in step iiia), see below. The blending of the one or more pharmaceutical excipient(s) with the mixture after step ii) can be carried out with conventional mixing devices, e.g. in a diffusion mixer like Turbula® T10B (Willy A. Bachofen AG Maschinenfabrik, Muttenz, Switzerland) or Bohle PM400S (L.B. Bohle Maschinen + Verfahren GmbH, Ennigerloh, Germany). Blending can be carried out e.g. for 1 minute to 40 minutes, preferably for 5 minutes to 25 minutes at e.g. 3 to 30 rpm, preferably 5 to 15 rpm.

Blending can be carried out e.g. for 1 minute to 30 minutes, preferably for 2 minutes to 10 minutes at e.g. 3 to 30 rpm, preferably 5 to 15 rpm. In an embodiment of the invention, after the blending in step iiia), the resulting mixture can be sieved. In a preferred embodiment, the sieve has a mesh size of 100 to 1000 μιη, preferably of 200 to 800 μιη. In step iv), the mixture from step iii) or iiia) can be further processed into a dosage form. In one preferred embodiment, the step iv) of processing the mixture from step iii) or iiia) in a dosage form can include compressing the respective mixture into tablets.

As described above, siponimod can be provided as a free base, as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, polymorph, solvate, hydrate or prodrug thereof. In a preferred embodiment it is provided as siponimod hemifumarate. In step ii) of the present invention, siponimod is pre-blended with moisture protective agent. The moisture protective agent has the objective to coat the siponimod particles and protect them from moisture during the dosage form formation process. In another embodiment, siponimod is pre-blended in step ii) with a moisture-protective agent and a pharmaceutical excipient as disclosed above, preferably a filler. Preferably, the pre-blending step ii) is carried out at room temperature, i The pre-blending can be carried out with conventional mixing devices, e.g. in a diffusion mixer like Turbula® T10B (Willy A. Bachofen AG Maschinenfabrik, Muttenz, Switzerland) or Bohle PM400S (L B. Bohle Maschinen + Verfahren GmbH, Ennigerloh, Germany). Blending can be carried out e.g. for 1 minute to 30 minutes, preferably for 2 minutes to less than 10 minutes at e.g. 15 to 50 rpm, preferably 15 to 30 rpm. In an alternative embodiment, the mixing can be conducted such that the siponimod in step ii) is mixed with a first part of the moisture-protective agent or a mixture of the moisture-protective agent and a pharmaceutical excipient in a mixing device, for example in a high shear or tumbler mixer. After this first mixing step, a second part of the moisture-protective agent or a mixture of the moisture-protective agent and a pharmaceutical excipient can be added, which is followed by a second mixing step. This procedure can be repeated until the last part of the moisture-protective agent or a mixture of the moisture-protective agent and a pharmaceutical excipient is used, preferably one to five times. After the pre-blending in step ii), the resulting mixture can be sieved before being blended with one or more pharmaceutical excipients in step iii).

After this first mixing step, a second part of the at least one pharmaceutical excipient can be added, which is followed by a second mixing step. This procedure can be repeated until the last part of the at least one pharmaceutical excipient is used, preferably one to five times. In a further alternative embodiment, the mixing can be conducted such that the mixture of step ii) is mixed with a first pharmaceutical excipient of the at least one pharmaceutical excipient in a mixing device, for example in a high shear or tumbler mixer. After this first mixing step, a second pharmaceutical excipient of the at least one pharmaceutical excipient is added, which is followed by a second mixing step. Hence, the number of mixing steps corresponds to the number of pharmaceutical excipients of step iii). If in step ii) siponimod is pre-blended with a moisture-protective agent and a pharmaceutical excipient, in step iii) the same excipient as in step ii) can be added again to the mixture resulting from step ii). Alternatively, if the at least one pharmaceutical excipient, e.g. the filler, is composed of a mixture of a first and a second compound, e.g. lactose and microcrystalline cellulose, the first compound of the mixture can be added in step ii), the second compound in step iii), eventually together with other pharmaceutical excipients. Yet further, if the at least one pharmaceutical excipient, e.g. the filler, is composed of a mixture of a first and a second compound, e.g. lactose and microcrystalline cellulose, a first part of the first compound of the mixture can be added in step ii), a second part of the first compound and the second compound can be added in step iii), optionally together with other pharmaceutical excipients. After the blending in step iii), the resulting mixture can be sieved. In a preferred embodiment, the sieve has a mesh size of 100 to 1000 μπι, preferably of 200 to 800 μπι. In an embodiment of the invention, the mixture obtained after step iii) is blended in an optional step iiia) with at least one further pharmaceutical excipients. The at least one pharmaceutical excipient is preferably selected from the group consisting of lubricants, binders, glidants, disintegrants and fillers, which are defined according to the above remarks regarding step iii). In a preferred embodiment, the at least one pharmaceutical excipient from optional step iiia) can be sieved by using a screening mill before being blended with the mixture obtained from step iii). In a preferred embodiment, the sieve has a mesh size of 100 to 1000 μιη, preferably of 200 to 800 μιη. The blending of the at least one pharmaceutical excipient in optional step iiia) with the mixture obtained after step iii) can be carried out with conventional mixing devices, e.g. in a diffusion mixer like Turbula® T10B (Willy A. Bachofen AG Maschinenfabrik, Muttenz, Switzerland) or Bohle PM400S (L B. Bohle Maschinen + Verfahren GmbH, Ennigerloh, Germany). Blending can be carried out e.g. for 1 minute to 30 minutes, preferably for 2 minutes to 10 minutes at e.g. 3 to 30 rpm, preferably 5 to 15 rpm. In an alternative embodiment, the mixing can be conducted such that the mixture of step iii) is mixed with a first part of the at least one pharmaceutical excipient in a mixing device, for example in a high shear or tumbler mixer. After this first mixing step, a second part of the at least one pharmaceutical excipient can be added, which is followed by a second mixing step. This procedure can be repeated until the last part of the at least one pharmaceutical excipient is used, preferably one to five times. In a further alternative embodiment, the mixing can be conducted such that the mixture of step iii) is mixed with a first pharmaceutical excipient of the at least one pharmaceutical excipient in a mixing device, for example in a high shear or tumbler mixer. After this first mixing step, a second pharmaceutical excipient of the at least one pharmaceutical excipient is added, which is followed by a second mixing step. Hence, the number of mixing steps corresponds to the number of pharmaceutical excipients of step iiia). In a preferred embodiment, one pharmaceutical excipient is mixed in step iiia). In an embodiment of the invention, after the blending in step iiia), the resulting mixture can be sieved. In a preferred embodiment, the sieve has a mesh size of 100 to 1000 μιη, preferably of 200 to 800 μιη. In step iv), the mixture from step iii) or iiia) can be further processed into a dosage form. In one preferred embodiment, the step iv) of processing the mixture from step iii) or iiia) in a dosage form can include compressing the respective mixture into tablets. The compression of the mixture from step iii) or iiia) can be preferably a direct compression. This direct compression step can preferably be carried out on a rotary press, for example on a Fette® 102i (Fette GmbH, Germany) or a Riva® piccola (Riva, Argentina). More preferably the tablets are formed on a Korsch PH250 or Korsch XL400. If a rotary press is applied, the main compaction force can range from 1 to 60 kN, preferably from 2 to 30 kN, more preferably form 3 to 15 kN. In optional step v), the dosage form, preferably the tablet, is film-coated. For this purpose, standard methods of film-coating tablets may be employed. The above- mentioned amounts of siponimod, moisture protective agent and excipients, however, relate to the uncoated tablet. For film-coating, macromolecular substances are preferably used, such as modified celluloses, polymethacrylates, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl acetate phthalate and/or shellack. Examples Example 1 - Process Blending In order to obtain a final mixture ready to be processed to a dosage form, e.g. a tablet, siponimod hemifumarate having a X90 value of 18 μιη is blended with different excipients according to the flow diagram of Figure 1. Therefore, siponimod hemifumarate is pre-blended in step 1 with a mixture of glyceryl behenate as moisture protective agent and spray-dried lactose as filler. The pre-blending is carried out in a diffusion mixer Bohle PM400S (L.B. Bohle Maschinen + Verfahren GmbH, Ennigerloh, Germany) for 10 min at 10 rpm. The mixture of step 1 is then sieved in step 2 using a screening mill having a mesh size of 800 μπι. The sieved mixture is then blended in step 3 with further spray-dried lactose as filler, Aerosil as glidant, polyvinylpolypyrrolidon XL (crospovidone) as disintegrant and microcrystalline cellulose GR as filler in a diffusion mixer Bohle PM400S for 5 min at 10 rpm. The resulting mixture is again sieved in step 4 using an oscillating screening mill Frewitt GLA ORV having a mesh size of 800 μπι and mixed in step 5 in a diffusion mixer Bohle PM400S for 25 min at 10 rpm. In step 6 glyceryl behenate as lubricant, which has been sieved using an oscillating screening mill Frewitt GLA ORV having a mesh size of 800 μπι, is added to the mixture of step 5 and mixed in step 7 in a diffusion mixer Bohle PM400S for 10 min at 10 rpm, resulting in the final dosage form mixture. The final dosage mixture resulted from the blending process is then processed into a dosage form, preferably a tablet. The tablets are formed using a rotary tablet press, a Korsch PH 250 or Korsch XL400 with a compression force of 6 kN. The tablets are then de-dusted with a Kramer deduster (Kramer AG, Switzerland) and finally coated by a perforated pan coater Glatt Coater GC 750 (Glatt GmbH, Germany).
