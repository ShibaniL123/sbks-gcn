FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel hydrate, anhydrous and solvate crystal forms of zolpidem hemitartrate and the preparation thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Zolpidem, as a hemitartrate salt, is currently approved for the short-term treatment of insomnia in the United States under the trademark ofAMBIEN. Zolpidem hemitartrate is classified as a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic of the imidazopyridine class. It has little effect on the stages of sleep in normal human subjects and is as effective as benzodiazepines in shortening sleep latency and prolonging total sleep time in patients with insomnia. The development of tolerance and physical dependence for patients using AMBIEN has been seen only very rarely and under unusual circumstances. (Goodman and Gilman's, The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics 371 (Joel G. Hardman et al., eds. 9th ed. 1996)). Zolpidem hemitartrate (CAS Registry No. 99294-93-6) has the chemical name imidazo[ 1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetamide, N,N,6-trimethyl-2-(4-methylphenyl)-,(2R,3R)-2,3-di hydroxy-butanedioate and is represented by the structural formula.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides new hydrate, anhydrous and solvate crystal forms of zolpidem hemitartrate. Crystal forms of a compound can be distinguished in a laboratory by X-ray diffraction spectroscopy and by other methods such as, infrared spectrometry. It is desirable to investigate all solid state forms of a drug, including all crystal/polymorphic forms, and to determine the stability, dissolution and flow properties of each crystal/polymorphic form. For a general review ofpolymorphs and the pharmaceutical applications of polymorphs see G.M. Wall, Pharm Manuf. 3, 33 (1986); J.K. Haleblian and W. McCrone, J Pharm. Sci., 58, 911 (1969); and J.K. Haleblian, J. Pharm. Sci., 64, 1269 (1975), all of which are incorporated herein by reference. As used herein, the term "zolpidem hemitartrate" includes hydrates and solvates of zolpidem hemitartrate. The term "water content" refers to the content of water based upon the Loss on Drying method (the "LOW' method) as described in Pharmacopeial Forum, Vol. 24, No. 1, p. 5438 (JanFeb 1998), the Karl Fisher assay for determining water content or thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The term "'equivalents of water" means molar equivalents of water. All percentages herein are by weight unless otherwise indicated. Those skilled in the art will also understand that the term "anhydrous" when used in reference to zolpidem hemitartrate describes zolpidem hemitartrate which is substantially free of water. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the term "monohydrate" when used in reference to zolpidem hemitartrate describes a crystalline material having a water content of about 2.3% w/w. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that the term "dihydmte" when used in reference to zolpidem hemitartrate describes a crystalline material having a water content of about 4.5% w/w. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that the term "trihydrate" when used in reference to zolpidem hemitartrate describes a crystalline material having a water content of about 6.6% w/w. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that the term "tetrahydrate" when used in reference to zolpidem hemitartrate describes a crystalline material having a water content of about 8.6% w/w. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that the term "methanolate","ethanolate", "solvates of isopropranor', "solvates ofbutanor' or "solvates ofethylacetate" refers to Zolpidem hemitartrate in which solvent is contained within the crystal lattice in quantities above 1%. One skilled in the art will also appreciate that the term "hemiethanolate" when used in reference to zolpidem hemitartrate describes a crystalline material having an ethanol content of about 2.9% w/w. Hydrate and solvate forms ofzolpidem hemitartrate are novel and distinct from each other in terms of their characteristic powder X-ray diffraction patterns and their thermal profiles. For the purposes of this specification, ambient temperature is fi'om about 20°C to about 25 °C. All powder X-ray diffraction patterns were obtained by methods known in the art using a Scintag X'TRA X-ray powder diffractometer, equipped with a solid stae Si(Li) detector thermoelectrically cooled, at scanning speed of 3 o min. scanning range 2-40 degrees two-theta. Copper radiation of k = 1.5418 was used. Measurement of thermal analysis are conducted for the purpose of evaluating the physical and chemical changes ffiat may take place in a heated sample. Thermal reactions can be endothermic (eg, melting, boiling, sublimation, vaporization, desolvation, solid- solid phase transitions, chemical degradation, etc.) or exothermic (eg, crystallization, oxidative decomposition, etc.) in nature. Such methodology has gained widespread use in the pharmaceutical industry in characterization ofpolymorphism. The quantitative applications of thermal applications of thermal analysis have proven to be useful in characterization of polymorphic systems. The most commonly applied techniques are thermogravimetry (TGA), differential thermal analysis (DTA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The DTA and TGA curves presented herein were obtained by methods known in the art using a DTG Shimadzu model DTG-50 (combined TGA and DTA). The weight of the samples was about 9 to about 13 rag. The samples were scanned up to about 300°C or above at a rate of 10°C/min. Samples were purged with nitrogen gas at a flow rate of ml/min. Standard alumina crucibles covered lids with one hole. Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) is a measure of the thermally induced weight loss of a material as a function of the applied temperature. TGA is restricted to transitions that involve either a gain or a loss of mass, and it is most commonly used to study desolvation processesand compound decomposition. Karl Fisher analysis, which is well known in the art, is also used to determine the quantity of water in a sample. As used herein a slurry refers to a suspension ofinsoluble particles or slightly soluble particles in an aqueous or organic (non-aqueous) liquid,without complete dissolution of the solid. SYNTHESIS OF ZOI PIDEM HEMITARTRATE The present invention provides a methods of synthesizing zolpidem hemitartrate. Zolpidem hemitartrate base may be synthesized as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,382,938. Therein, is disclosed that zolpidem base may be formed from zolpidic acid by reacting the acid with dimethyl amine, in the presence of carbonyldiimidazole. This method has several disadvantages such as low yield and formation of impurities which are difficult to remove. US Patent No. 4,382,938 also mentions the possibility of reacting zolpidic acid chloride with dimethyl amine. However no procedure for this preparation of zolpidiem is mentioned. The present patent present a procedure for the preparation of Zolpidem from zolpidic acid which has the following advantages: -High reaction yields -Improved purity profile of the prepared Zolpidem -Preparation of Zolpidem from zolpidic acid in a "one pot" procedure. Alternatively the base may be formed by reacting the zolpidic acid chloride withdimethyl "amine. U.S. Patent No. 4,794 185 discloses alternative methods for synthesizing zolpidem base. Once zolpidem base is formed, the zolpidem hemitartrate is prepared by dissolving the base in methanol and adding L(+)-tartric acid dissolved in methanol. The hemitartrate is then crystalized from methanol. Formation of the Acid Chloride Preferably, formation ofzolpidem base from the acid comprises a two-step reaction, in the first step, zolpidic acid chloride (II) is formed from zolpidic acid (I). z CH 3 0.3 pi H3C H3C di • HO.-- c ac id Zolpidic acid chloride I II The chlorination reaction can be performed using SOC1 2 , PCL 5 and POCL 3 . The most preferred chlorination agent is SOCI 2 because its excess can be removed smoothly after the reaction end by distillation from the reaction mass. Preferred solvents are aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated solvents and aprotic polar solvents and mixtures thereof. The most preferred reaction solvent is toluene containing traces of dimethyiformamide (DMF). The use of toluene as reaction solvent has the following advantages: 1. The intermediate zolpidic acid chloride (II) and the final zolpidem can be isolated at whish from this solvent in such a way that the procedure can be designed as a one step or two step process. : .......... : .................... 2. In the presence of toluene the excess of SOC1 2 is easy to remove as an azeotrop SOC1 2toluene. . 3. Zolpidic acid chloride (II) precipitate from the reaction mixture during the chlorination reaction. An overchlorination of the zolpidic acid is thus avoided. DMF can be regarded as a phase transfer catalyst of the chlorination reaction by facilitating the access of SOCI 2 to the Zo/pidic acid. Also in the precipitation of Zolpidem the presence of DMF contribute to a better purification effect of the reaction solvent. The preferred temperature range for forming the acid chloride is from about about 28°C. Most preferably the temperature is in the range of about 18 to about °C. After formation of the acid chloride, the thionyl chloride is distilled from the reaction mixture. The preferred temperature ofdistillation is in the range of about 30 to about Most preferably the temperature of distillation is in the range of about 35 to about The pressure of vacuum distillation is in the range of about 30 to about 100 mm Hg. Most preferably the pressure is in the range of about 30 to about 50 mm Hg. Formation of Zolpidem Base In the second step, zolpidic acid chloride (II) is used to form zolpidem base (the compound of formula III) in a reaction with dimethyl amine as shown. Zolpidic acid chloride Zolpidic base II III Preferred solvents are aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated solvents and ap ,- .... N CH rot ' CH 3 - ic H3 c ...... H 3 C - H3C..N 2 po CI_ H 3 £- \' ]at lvents and mixtures thereof. The most preferred solvent is toluene. The use of toluene as reaction solvent has the following advantages: 1. Zolpidic acid and coloured impurities formed during the chlorination reaction are effectively removed. 2. The crystallization process in toluene is optimal. 3. Essentially pure Zolpidem (98% area% by HPLC) is obtained Dimethylamine is preferably introduced as a gas until the pH is from about 8.5 and about 9.5. The preferred temperature range for forming the base is from about -5 to about +3 °C. Most preferably the temperature is in the range of about -5 to about 0 °C. After dimethylamine gas is introduced, the resulting zolpidem base forms a precipitate. After the solution is mixed for 1 hour, the solution is cooled to about -10 to about -12 °C. Typically the precipitate is then collected by filtration. However, the precipitate may be collected by any means known in the art. Th e zolpidem base is then dried and used to form the hemitartrate by dissolving the base in methanol and adding L(+)-tartric acid dissolved in methanol. The hemitartrate is then crystalized from methanol. NOVEL HYDRATE, ANHYDROUS AND SOLVATE FORMS OF ZOLPIDEM HEMITARTRATE The present invention provides novel crystal forms of zolpidem hemitartrate which will be designated as Forms B, C, D, E, F, G, H and L. These forms can be distinguished from the prior art form ofzolpidem hemitartrate and from each other by characteristic powder X-ray diffraction patterns and thermal profiles. The different crystal forms may also be characterized by their respective solvation state. The most commonly encountered solvates among pharmaceuticals are those of 1:1 stoiehiometry. Occasionally mixed solvate species are encountered. When water or solvent is incorporated into the crystal lattice of a compound in stoichiometric. • proportions, the molecular adduct or adducts formed are referred to as hydrates or solvates. Zolpidem hemitartrate Form A Zolpidem hemitartrate Form A ("Form A") is characterized by an X-ray diffraction pattern with peaks at about 6.5, 9.0, 16.1, 1616, 24.6 and 27.3 +0.2 degrees two-theta. The diffraction pattern is reproduced in Fig. 1. The above x-ray diffraction pattern was found in the prior art EP standard sample. When samples of From A containing substantially particles smaller than all 200 microns were examined the x-ray diffraction pattern showed a newpeaks at about 8.6 0.2 degrees two-theta. Other unexpected peaks were observed at 6.7, 11.2, 15.4 and 17.3 +0.2 degrees two-theta. The DTG thermal profile of Form A is shown in Fig. 2. The thermal profile shows an endotherm at about 110°C, followed by an exotherm; an additional exothermic/endothermic event at above about 150°C; a melting endotherm at about 188°C; and an endothermic event at about 200°C concomitant to decomposition. The hydration states of Form A is characterized by TGA and Karl Fisher analysis. Zolpidem hemitartrate described in the EP monograph (2001), herein identified as Form A, is reported as a hygroscopic solid. It was found by us, that Form A may contain about 1.0 % water or more, and readily absorbs up to 3.0 % water as measured by Karl Fischer analysis. The 110°C endotherm of the TGA is attributed to partial desorption of water with an overall water content of about 3%. Zolpidem hemitartrate Form B Zolpidem hemitartrate Form B is characterized by a powder X-ray diffraction pattern at about 8.2, 17.3, and 18.4 • 0.2 degrees two-theta. Zolpidem hemitartrate Form Zolpidem hemitartrate Form C ("Form C") is an anhydrous (i.e. non-solvated) form of crystalline zolpidem hemitartrate. Zolpidem hemitartrate Form C is characterized by an X-ray diffraction pattern with peaks at about 7.3, 9.5, 10.7, 12.4, 13.0, 13.8, 14.6, 16.2, 17.8, 18.9, 19.5, 20.3, 21.3, 23.5, 23.8, 25.0, and 27.0 + 0.2degrees two-theta. The most characteristic peaks of Form C are at about 7.3, 9.5, 17.8 and 23.8 ± 0.2degrees two-theta. The diffi'action pattern is reproduced in Fig. 3. " ..................... The DTG thermal profile of Form C is shown in Fig. 4. The thermal profile shows a melting endotherm at about 187°C and an endothermic event above 200°C concomitant to decomposition. The unsolvated states of Form C is characterized by TGA and Karl Fisher analysis. The weight loss up to about 150°C (prior to decomposition) and the level of water measured by Karl Fischer are insignificant. Thus, the TGA and Karl Fisher analysis indicate that Form C is an anhydrous form ofzoipidem hemitartrate. Zolpidem hemitartrate Form D Zolpidem hemitartrate Form D ("Form D") is a monohydrate or hemiethanolate crystalline form of zolpidem hemitartrate. Zolpidem hemitartrate Form D is characterized by an X-ray diffraction pattem with peaks at about 7.1, 8.4, 9.5, 10.2, 12.2, 12.9, 13.2, 14.1, 15.9, 16.3, 17.7, 18.8,19.6, 21.0, 21_7, 23.0, 23.6, 24.5, 25.9, 26.5, 30.0, and 30.6 +0.2 degrees two-theta. The most characteristic peaks of Form D are at about 7.1, 9.5, 14.1, 19.6 and 24.5 4-0.2 degrees two-theta. The diffraction pattern is reproduced in Fig. The DTG thermal profile of Form D is shown in Fig. 6. The DSC thermal profile shows an endotherrn at about 80°C. In addition, a melting endotherm at 188°C and an endothermic event at about 200°C concomitant to decomposition occur. The solvation states of Form D is characterized by TGA and Karl Fisher analysis. Form D has a weight loss of about 2.3 to about 2.7% by TGA (theoretical value of monohydrate: 2.3%, hemiethanolate: 2.9%) at about 80°C.
