The portion of the wristband including the hole 1302 is shown in FIG. 14 A. [0060] FIG. 14Β shows a cut view 1402 of a wristband according to various embodiments. The portion of the wristband including the hook 1202 is shown in FIG. 14Β. [0061] FIG. 15Α shows a section view 1500 of a closing mechanism (in other words: clasp mechanism) according to various embodiments. The portion of the section view 1500 included in a dashed box 1502 is shown in an enlarged view in FIG. 15Β. [0062] As illustrated in FIG. 12, FIG. 13, FIG. 14Α, FIG. 14Β, FIG. 15Α and FIG. 15Β, according to various embodiments, the locking mechanism may be split into a hook side 1200 and clasp side 1300 (in other words: hole side). Each side may include a magnet (which may be in block shape or cylinder shape). The magnetic force may allow the hook 1202 to self-align into the clasp (in other words: into the hole 1302) and keep it intact to prevent accidental dislodge on the wristband (for example smart band). [0063] FIG. 16Α shows an illustration 1600 of a clasp in which the clasp is secured by at least one spring-loaded bump 1610 (on a hook side 1604) that may engage with a matching recess 1610 (on a clasp side 1602). The spring 1606 in the spring-loaded mechanism may be made from any material that may provide consistent push force that maintains the position of the dome/bump 1608 (in the recess). The location of the bump/dome 1608 may also be shifted or placed on the clasp side 1602 (in other words: the spring-loaded bump may be provided on the clasp side 1602, and the recess 1610 may be provided in the hook side). According to various embodiments, instead of providing a spring-loaded mechanism for forcing the bump into the recess, a bump made from a flexible material may be provided. [0064] FIG. 16Β shows an illustration 1612 of the appearance of the hook. [0065] FIG. 16C shows an illustration 1614 of the clasp side. [0066] According to various embodiments, a one step motion may provide an almost effortless way of closing of a wristband. [0067] It will be understood that although a magnet is illustrated in some of the drawings, the closing mechanism according to various embodiments also works without a magnet. In that case, the closing mechanism is closed by elastic forces provided by the elastic portion to bring the hook and the hole into a position in which the hook is inserted into the hole. By having a direction of the hook entering the hole which may be at least substantially perpendicular to a length of the wristband, by pulling along the length of the wristband, the closing mechanism will not open, so that it is safe to wear the wristband once it is closed. Furthermore, by friction forces of the hook in the hole, the closing mechanism may be secured. Furthermore, once a user wears the wristband, there are further friction forces between the wristband and the skin of the user, so that a lateral motion of the hook with respect to the hole may be prevented, even without a magnet provided in the hole or on the hook. [0068] According to various embodiments, a magnet may be provided in the hole and/ or on the hook. In this case, the magnet may provide for an additional force to secure the closing mechanism in its closed position. Furthermore, the magnet may be used as a switch to determine whether the wristband is closed or on. Based on the information received by the switch, and for example if the wristband includes electronics, the wristband may carry energy saving measures, for example the wristband may activate radio communication to a smartphone or another device only if it is closed, or may enable acoustic or graphical output only if it is closed.
