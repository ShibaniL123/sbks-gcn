METHOD OF CLEANSING THE COLON The present invention relates to a method of cleansing the colon using colon cleansing solutions, and compositions and kits associated therewith. Colon cleansing compositions are also known as lavage solutions, bowel cleansers, purgatives or colonic evacuants. 1. Background Colon or bowel cleansing is important before numerous surgical or diagnostic procedures, including colonoscopy, barium enema examination, sigmoidoscopy and colon surgery. Such procedures are often carried out on an outpatient basis and thus it is desirable that the colon cleansing be carried out by the patient at home, prior to arrival at the hospital or surgery where the procedure is to take place. It is therefore important that patient compliance is good without medical supervision if satisfactory colon cleansing is to be achieved prior to the procedure. Intestinal lavage, in which a large volume of an aqueous electrolyte solution containing sodium sulphate and polyethylene glycol is ingested, is one of the most common methods for colon cleansing. These osmotically active agents are non-absorbable or only poorly absorbable and thus retain water in the bowel, resulting in copious diarrhoea and cleansing of the colon. For effective cleansing, many of these compositions must be ingested in quantities of between 2 to 4 litres. The unpleasant taste of these compositions combined with the large volumes required to be ingested often contributes to nausea or vomiting, resulting in poor patient compliance and failure to consume the full volume of solution. Poor patient compliance can lead to inadequate preparation of the colon which can, in turn, lead to cancellation or repetition of the colonoscopy or other procedure becoming necessary or, worse, non-detection of lesions or polyps indicative of cancer risk. Detection of polyps in the right-sided colon is particularly challenging (see for example Qumseya et al. Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology, 2012, doi: 10.1038/ctg.2012.14). A number of improved colon cleansing compositions are described in WO 2004/037292. A colon cleansing composition according to WO 2004/037292 that comprises polyethylene glycol 3350, sodium sulphate, an ascorbate component, electrolytes, sweetener and flavouring is commercialised as a powder for oral solution under the tradename MOVIPREP® (registered trademark of Velinor AG, a member of the Norgine group of companies). The MOVIPREP solution is effective despite being taken in a substantially lower volume than other colon cleansing solutions. Typically, only 2 litres of the solution need to be taken by an adult patient (along with additional clear fluid), a significant benefit when compared to taking 4 litres of previous solutions. A recent advance in colon cleansing agents is provided by the product marketed as SUPREP by Braintree Laboratories, Inc. SUPRPEP contains 17.5g sodium sulphate, 3.13g potassium sulphate and 1.6g magnesium sulphate and it is taken in a volume of 16 US fluid ounces (473ml). A treatment comprises two doses of that solution. Various regimens for the timing of ingestion of colon cleansing solutions are mentioned in the literature and in patient information leaflets that accompany colon cleansing products. For example, the MOVIPREP solution mentioned above may be taken (optionally with additional clear liquids also being taken) in the evening before the examination or procedure, or the MOVIPREP solution may be taken in a "split-dose" regimen, with approximately half of the cleansing solution being taken the evening before the examination or procedure ("first dose"), and the remainder being taken the following morning ("second dose"). Similarly, the SUPREP product mentioned above is recommended to be taken as first dose in the evening before the examination procedure, accompanied by an additional quart of water (946ml), followed by a second dose in the morning of the procedure. An alternative to the lavage solutions described above is provided by low volume hypertonic salt solutions. Examples include Fleet's phosphosoda product and sodium picosulphate solutions. These are very concentrated salt solutions and patients need ingest only a small volume of them (around 100ml). However, these products have been associated with a hypo-osmolar state and electrolyte imbalance in subjects, particularly hyponatremia. They are particularly contra-indicated in subjects with kidney problems. Despite the advances that have been made, all lavage-type colon cleansing products on the market continue to require a subject to ingest a large volume of solution (2 litres in the case of the MOVIPREP solution). Many subjects find the ingestion of a large volume unpleasant or difficult and poor patient compliance thus remains a problem. There remains a need for alternative colon cleansing solutions that are effective when ingested in small volumes, but do not cause electrolyte imbalances in subjects. There also remains a need for colon cleansing solutions that are more pleasant for subjects to ingest, whilst retaining good cleansing effectiveness. 2. Summary of the invention The invention provides, in a first aspect, a colon cleansing solution comprising: a) 300 to 800 mmol per litre ascorbate anion provided by a mixture of: (i) ascorbic acid and (ϋ) one or more salts of ascorbic acid the components (i) and (ii) being present in a molar ratio of from 1 :4.5 to 1 :7.0; and b) 10 to 200 g per litre polyethylene glycol. This is sometimes referred hereafter as "solution of the invention". The solution of the invention has a surprisingly palatable taste. The particular ratio of ascorbic acid to salt of ascorbic acid enables the salty taste of ascorbate salt to be balanced by sourness from acid to a palatable extent, whilst at the same time not reducing the osmotic effect of the ascorbate component or making the solution too sour. The solution of the invention is highly effective as a colon cleansing solution when ingested in a lower volume than many prior art solutions, and it has a good tolerability profile. 3. Detailed description a) Contents of solutions The solutions of the invention are aqueous solutions. The mixture of ascorbic acid and one or more salts of ascorbic acid will, for convenience, be referred to herein as the "ascorbate component". Suitable salts of ascorbic acid include alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts. For example, a salt may be selected from sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium salts. For example, preferred salts of ascorbic acid include sodium ascorbate, potassium ascorbate, magnesium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate. The molar ratio between (i) the ascorbic acid and (ii) the one or more salts of ascorbic acid is the molar ratio of the ascorbate moieties; for example, magnesium ascorbate comprises two moles of ascorbate per mole of salt; for the ratio purposes, it is the number of moles of ascorbate that is counted. Particularly preferred salts of ascorbic acid are magnesium ascorbate and sodium ascorbate, for example sodium ascorbate. In one embodiment, the solution of the invention comprises ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate (and preferably no further ascorbate). Preferably, the molar ratio of the components (i) and (ii) is from 1 :4.75 to 1 :6.75; more preferably from 1 :5.0 to 1 :6.0; for example from 1 :5.40 to 1 :5.80; for example 15:85. The solution of the invention preferably comprises ascorbate anion in a concentration of: 300- 700mmol per litre, for example 350-650mmol per litre, for example 450-600 mmol per litre. A solution of the invention may comprise 50 to 140g/litre of ascorbate component. For example, a solution of the invention comprises 60 to 140g/litre, for example 80 to 13 Og/litre, for example 80 to 120g/litre, for example 100 to 120g/litre of ascorbate component. Ascorbic acid has a molecular weight of 176g/mol. Sodium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 198g/mol. Accordingly, a mixture of ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate in a molar ratio of from 1 :4.5 to 1 :7.0 has ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate present in a weight ratio of 1 :5.063 to 1 :7.875. For example, the weight ratio can be 1 :5.344 to 1 :7.594; more preferably from 1 :5.625 to 1 :6.75; for example from 1 :6.075 to 1 :6.525, for example 1 :6.38. For example, a solution of the invention may comprise from 6 to 25 g/litre of ascorbic acid and 50 to 120 g/litre of sodium ascorbate, for example 12 to 20 g/litre of ascorbic acid and 80 to 120 g/litre of sodium ascorbate (with the ratio between them being as mentioned above). For example, a solution of the invention may comprise from 14 to 16g g/litre of ascorbic acid and 92 to 100 g/litre of sodium ascorbate. Potassium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 214g/mol. Accordingly, a mixture of ascorbic acid and potassium ascorbate in a molar ratio of from 1 :4.5 to 1 :7.0 has ascorbic acid and potassium ascorbate present in a weight ratio of 1 :5.471 to 1 :8.511. For example, the weight ratio can be 1 :5.776 to 1 :8.208; more preferably from 1 :6.080 to 1 :7.295; for example from 1 :6.565 to 1 :7.052, for example 1 :6.896. For example, a solution of the invention may comprise from 6 to 25 g/litre of ascorbic acid and 50 to 125 g/litre of potassium ascorbate, for example 6 to 12 g/litre of ascorbic acid and 80 to 120 g/litre of potassium ascorbate. Magnesium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 374.5g/mol and each mole of magnesium ascorbate provides two moles of ascorbate. Accordingly, a mixture of ascorbic acid and magnesium ascorbate in a molar ratio of from 1 :4.5 to 1 :7.0 (of ascorbate anion) has ascorbic acid and magnesium ascorbate present in a weight ratio of 1 :4.794 to 1 :7.457. For example, the weight ratio can be 1 :5.061 to 1 :7.191 ; more preferably from 1 :5.326 to 1 :6.397 for example from 1 :5.753 to 1 :6.179, for example 1 :6.042. For example, a solution of the invention may comprise from 6 to 25 g/litre of ascorbic acid and 45 to 120 g/litre of magnesium ascorbate, for example 6 to 12 g/litre of ascorbic acid and 75 to 115 g/litre of magnesium ascorbate. Depending on the pH of the solution of the invention, some ascorbate anion may be protonated and thus exist as free ascorbic acid in solution. At the pH of solutions that would typically be administered, only a very minor proportion of ascorbate is protonated. In calculations of concentrations of "ascorbate anion" herein, the concentration of "ascorbate anion" is taken as the total concentration of all ascorbate anion present, including the proportion that is protonated. The cleansing solution comprises polyethylene glycol. The polyethylene glycol (PEG) may, for example, have an average molecular weight of 2000 to 8000, for example 2500 to 4500 Da, for example 2680 to 4020 Da, for example 3000 to 4000 Da. For example, the PEG may be PEG 3350 or PEG 4000 as defined in national pharmacopeias. PEG8000 may also be used. Further examples of suitable PEGs recognized in some national pharmacopeias include Macrogols, for example Macrogol 3350 or Macrogol 4000. The cleansing solution comprises 10 to 200 g per litre of PEG. Preferably, the solution of the invention comprises 20 to 160g per litre of PEG, more preferably 40 to 120 g per litre, for example 60 to 100 g per litre, for example 75 to 85 g per litre, for example 80 g per litre. The cleansing solution may additionally comprise one or more of: c) one or more electrolytes; d) one or more alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphates; e) one or more flavouring agents; f) one or more sweeteners. The cleansing solution may comprise one or more electrolytes. Electrolytes include salts of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, particularly sodium and potassium; and salts of chloride, iodide, bicarbonate and carbonate, particularly chloride. Preferred electrolytes are sodium chloride and potassium chloride. In an embodiment, the solution is essentially free from sodium bicarbonate, for example essentially free from any bicarbonate. For example, the solution of the invention may comprise sodium chloride at a concentration of 1 to 10 g per litre. For example, sodium chloride may be present at a concentration of 3 to 8 g per litre, for example 4 to 7g per litre; for example 6.0 to 6.8g per litre; for example 5.6g per litre or 6.4g per litre. For example, the solution of the invention may comprise potassium chloride at a concentration of 1 to 10 g per litre. For example, potassium chloride may be present at a concentration of 1 to 7 g per litre, for example 1.5 to 5g per litre, for example 1.5 to 3g per litre, for example 2.0 to 2.8 g per litre; for example 2.4g per litre or 2.6g per litre. In an embodiment, the solution of the invention comprises sodium chloride and potassium chloride. They can be present in the amounts mentioned immediately above. For example, sodium chloride may be present at a concentration of 4 to 7g per litre and potassium chloride may be present at a concentration of 1.5 to 3g per litre. The cleansing solution may comprise one or more alkali metal sulphates, alkaline earth metal sulphates or a mixture thereof (herein referred to as a "sulphate component"). An alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphate may, for example, be selected from sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate and magnesium sulphate. The solution of the invention may comprise more than one of sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate and magnesium sulphate, for example all three. Preferably, the sulphate component is or includes sodium sulphate. For example, the solution of the invention may comprise a sulphate component at a concentration of 2 to 20 g per litre, for example 5 to 15 g per litre, for example 8 to 15 g per litre, for example 10 to 14 g per litre, for example 12 g per litre. The one or more sulphate salts may be provided in any pharmaceutically acceptable form: they may each be anhydrous, or be in a hydrated form. The weights mentioned herein refer to the weight of the sulphate salt excluding any water of hydration. In an alternative preferred embodiment, the solution of the invention does not comprise a sulphate component; that is to say that the solution is essentially free from alkali metal sulphates and alkaline earth metal sulphates; in particular essentially free from sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate and magnesium sulphate. Herein, the term "essentially free from" a component means that the named component is present at a level that is below the level that has any functional effect in the solution of the invention in its use; for example, the named component may be at a level that is below the level at which it has a measurable clinical effect. For example, it may mean that the component is present at a level of less than 0. lg per litre; for example less than 0.03g per litre; for example less than O.Olg per litre, for example less than 0.003g per litre, for example less than O.OOlg per litre. In the solutions of the invention described herein, the quantities of the individual components recited do not include any solutes that may be present in the water used to prepare the solutions, for example, in hard water areas there may be significant amounts of Ca2+ and Mg2+ carbonates, bicarbonates or sulphates present in tap water. The cleansing solution preferably includes a flavouring agent. A flavouring agent for use in compositions of the invention should preferably mask saltiness, be relatively sweet but not excessively so, and be stable in the composition. A flavouring agent makes the solutions more palatable and thus aids patient compliance. Preferred flavourings include lemon e.g. Ungerer Lemon (available from Ungerer Limited, Sealand Road, Chester, England CHI 4LP), strawberry e.g. Ungerer Strawberry, grapefruit e.g. Ungerer Grapefruit flavouring powder, blackcurrant e.g. Ungerer Blackcurrant, pineapple e.g. IFF (International Flavours and Fragrances) Pineapple flavouring powder, orange eg Firmenich Orange, vanilla/lemon and lime e.g. IFF Vanilla and Givaudin Roure Lemon and Lime Flav-o-lok, fruit punch eg Ungerer fruit punch, citrus punch, mango, and berry. Those and further suitable flavourings are available from International Flavours and Fragrances Inc. (Duddery Hill, Haverhill, Suffolk, CB9 8LG, England), Ungerer & Company (Sealand Road, Chester, England CHI 4LP) or Firmenich (Firmenich UK Ltd., Hayes Road, Southall, Middlesex UB2 5NN). More preferred flavourings are lemon, kiwi, strawberry, grapefruit, orange, fruit punch and mango. Citrus flavour, orange grapefruit flavour, mango, fruit punch and orange flavour are particularly preferred. It is preferred that the flavouring agent is alcohol-free. The amount of flavouring agent required depends on the nature and strength of the flavouring in question. Typically, it is 0.05 to 4.5 g per litre, for example 0.05 to 2.0 g per litre, for example 0.2 to 1.8g per litre, for example 1.0 to 1.8g per litre, for example 3.0 to 4.5g per litre, for example 0.3g per litre or 1.2g per litre, for example 3.2 or 4.2g per litre. The cleansing solution preferably includes a sweetener. Sugar-based sweeteners are generally not suited for colon cleansing compositions because the delivery of unabsorbed sugars to the colon provides a substrate for bacteria. Such sugars may be metabolised by the bacteria to form explosive gases such as hydrogen and methane. The presence of explosive gases in the colon can be highly dangerous when electrical apparatus is to be used during colonoscopy or other procedures. Preferred sweeteners include aspartame, acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K), sucralose and saccharine, and/ or combinations thereof. For example, compositions of the invention may comprise one or both of aspartame and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K). For example, compositions of the invention may comprise one or both of sucralose and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K). In a preferred embodiment, the solution comprises aspartame or sucralose, for example aspartame. Alternatively, compositions of the invention can be essentially free from added sweeteners, for example to minimize the number of different components in the compositions. A souring agent (for example citric acid) may be present as a taste enhancer. A souring agent is a component that imparts a sourness to a composition. Other souring agents include malic acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, gluconodeltalactone, phosphoric acid, succinic acid, phytic acid, lactic acid or salts thereof. The souring agent (for example citric acid) may be provided in an encapsulated form. The encapsulation provides a coating that isolates the souring agent from other components and from air and moisture prior to its use. Several encapsulated forms of citric acid, or other souring agents, are commercially available. For example, the encapsulation may be with a water-soluble coating. The amount of sweetener required depends on the nature and strength of the sweetener being considered. Typically, it is 0.10 to 4 g per litre. For example, the sweetener may be aspartame at 0.5 to 4g per litre, for example 2.5 to 4.0 g per litre, for example 3.0g per litre, for example 3.86g per litre. Those quantities of aspartame are particularly suitable when used with orange flavouring, for example orange flavouring at 0.2 to 1.8g per litre, for example 1.0 to 1.8g per litre, for example 0.3g per litre, 0.875g per litre or 1.2g per litre. For example, the sweetener may be aspartame at 1.0 to 2.5g per litre, for example 1.5 to 2.0g per litre, for example 1.75g per litre. The invention thus provides a colon cleansing solution comprising: a) 300 to 800 mmol per litre ascorbate anion provided by a mixture of (i) ascorbic acid and (ii) one or more salts of ascorbic acid the components (i) and (ii) being present in a molar ratio of from 1 :4.5 to 1 :7.0; b) 10 to 200 g per litre PEG. c) one or more electrolytes; d) optionally one or more alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphates; e) optionally one or more flavouring agents; and f) optionally one or more sweeteners. It will be apparent to the reader of this specification, that the term "comprising" and grammatical variations thereof, in relation to embodiments of the invention described, may be substituted in all cases (unless the context dictates otherwise) with the term "consisting essentially of or "consisting of. In the case of a solution that "consists of or "consists essentially of the stated components, the balance is in each case made up of water. In particular, the invention provides a colon cleansing solution comprising: a) 300 to 800 mmol per litre ascorbate anion provided by a mixture of (i) ascorbic acid and (ii) one or more salts of ascorbic acid the components (i) and (ii) being present in a molar ratio of from 1 :4.5 to 1 :7.0; b) 10 to 200 g per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da; c) sodium chloride and potassium chloride; d) optionally sodium sulphate; e) optionally one or more flavouring agents; and f) optionally one or more sweeteners. Each of c) and d) may be present in the concentrations described above. Each of e) and f) may be as described above and/or be in the concentrations described above. In particular, the invention provides a colon cleansing solution comprising: a) 300 to 800 mmol per litre ascorbate anion provided by a mixture of (i) ascorbic acid and (ii) one or more salts of ascorbic acid the components (i) and (ii) being present in a molar ratio of from 1 :4.5 to 1 :7.0; b) 10 to 200 g per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da; c) sodium chloride and potassium chloride; e) one or more flavouring agents; and f) one or more sweeteners. In one embodiment, one or more components of c), d) (when present), e) and f) are present in the solution of the invention. In an alternative presentation, some or all of components c), d) (when present), e) and f) may be provided separately from the solution of the invention, for example in a tablet or capsule. For example, components c) and d) may be provided in tablet form. In an embodiment, the solution of the invention may comprise a) the ascorbate component and b) PEG, and optional flavouring and sweetener (e) and f)), and a tablet or capsule may comprise c) the one or more electrolytes (optionally with d), the one or more alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphates), again with optional flavouring and sweetener (e) and f). The flavouring and sweeteners need not be the same in the tablet or capsule as in the solution. In one embodiment, the invention provides a colon cleansing solution comprising: a) (i) 12 to 20g per litre ascorbic acid and (ii) 80 to 120g per litre sodium ascorbate the components (i) and (ii) being present in a weight ratio of from 1 :5063 to 1 :7.875; b) 60 to lOOg per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da; c) 3 to 8g per litre sodium chloride and 1 to 7g per litre potassium chloride; e) one or more flavouring agents; and f) one or more sweeteners. In an embodiment, the solution of the invention consists essentially of those components; that is to say that it does not contain any further components in significant quantities. The solution of the invention may, for example, not contain any sulphate. For example, the invention provides a colon cleansing solution consisting essentially of: a) (i) 14 to 16g per litre ascorbic acid and (ii) 92 to lOOg per litre sodium ascorbate b) 75 to 85 per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da; c) 6.0 to 6.8g per litre sodium chloride and 2.0 to 2.8g per litre potassium chloride; e) one or more flavouring agents; and f) one or more sweeteners. For example, the invention provides a colon cleansing solution consisting essentially of: a) (i) 15.08g per litre ascorbic acid and (ii) 96.22g per litre sodium ascorbate b) 80g per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da; c) 6.4g per litre sodium chloride and 2.4g per litre potassium chloride; e) one or more flavouring agents; and f) one or more sweeteners. For example, the flavouring and sweetener may be 1.20g per litre orange flavour and 3.86g per litre aspartame. For example, the flavouring and sweetener may be 3.20g per litre citrus flavour and 1.75g per litre aspartame. For example, the flavouring and sweetener may be 4.20g per litre orange grapefruit flavour and 1.75g per litre aspartame. Preferably, the colon cleansing solution is hyper-osmotic. That is to say that it has a higher osmotic strength than blood in the human body. It may, for example have a measured osmolality in the range 500 to 2000 mOsmol/kg. For example, the osmolality may be in the range 700 to 1800 mOsmol/kg. For example, the solutes in 500ml of the solution of the invention may have a measured V(350) value of from 1000 to 2000ml, for example from 1300 to 2000ml, for example from 1400 to 1900ml, and be in a volume of 400 to 600ml, for example 500ml. The V(350) value is the volume of water that is required to provide a solution with an osmolality of 350mOsmol/kg, the total volume being the final volume after a volume water has been added to a solution having an initial volume. Osmolality can be measured in various ways. In general, either freezing point depression or vapour- pressure alteration is used. For example, an Advanced Instruments, Inc Model 3250 osmometer (a freezing point depression device) can be used. Vapour pressure measurement can also be used, for example using an ELITech Group Vapro 5600 device. Osmolality values cited herein are preferably taken to be values measured using a freezing point depression osmometer, for example using an Advanced Instruments, Inc Model 3250 osmometer following standard operating procedure. The invention provides a colon cleansing solution comprising: a) 300 to 800 mmol per litre ascorbate anion provided by a mixture of (i) ascorbic acid and (ii) one or more salts of ascorbic acid the components (i) and (ii) being present in a molar ratio of from 1 :4.5 to 1 :7.0; and b) 10 to 200 g per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da; and 500ml of the solution having a V(350) osmolality value of from 1300 to 2300ml. For example, 500ml of the solution may have a V(350) osmolality value of from 1500 to 2100ml, for example from 1700 to 2000ml, for example from 1800 to 1900ml. b) Additional optional contents of solutions Unless it is stated otherwise, the solutions of the invention may include one or more additional optional components: (i) antioxidants In general it is not necessary for the solutions of the invention to include preservatives or antioxidants. Nevertheless, low levels of anti-oxidants or preservatives may be used if required. (ii) laxatives In general, the solutions of the invention are effective without the need for any additional active ingredients. Nevertheless, a further active ingredient may be included if required. For example, a laxative may be present, for example a stimulant laxative. For example, bisacodyl, castor oil, senna or bisoxatin may be used. An example of a colon cleansing solution containing bisoxatin is known from WO2013001315. (iii) Contrast media For certain uses, one or more contrast media can be included in a solution of the invention. Examples of contrast media include barium or iodine products, diatrizoate (marketed, for example, as HYPAQUE 50), metrizoate (marketed, for example, as ISOPAQUE 370), ioxalgate (marketed, for example, as HEXABRIX), iopamidol (marketed, for example, as ISOVUE 370), iohexol (marketed, for example, as OMNIPAQUE 350), ioxilan (marketed, for example, as OXILAN 350), iopramide (marketed, for example, as ULTRA VIST 370), iodixanol (marketed, for example, as VISIPAQUE 320) and/or a diatrizoic acid or its anionic form diatrizoate (also known as amidotrizoic acid, or 3,5- diacetamido-2,4,6-triiodobenzoic acid; marketed, for example, as HYPAQUE).

A compound that disrupts biofilms may assist in separating an adherent polysaccharide DNA - containing layer, the so- called "biofilm" from the colonic mucosa. Removal of that layer may assist in achieving a cleaner and/or more easily visualized or stained mucosa. Biofilm-disrupting components or agents that may be mentioned include enzymes such as deoxyribonuclease (DNase), N-acetylcysteine, alginate lyase, glycoside hydrolase dispersin B; Quorum-sensing inhibitors e.g., ribonucleic acid III inhibiting peptide, Salvadora persica extracts, Competence-stimulating peptide, Patulin and penicillic acid; peptides - cathelicidin-derived peptides, small lytic peptide, PTP-7 (a small lytic peptide, see e.g., haridia (201 1) J. Microbiol. 49(4):663-8, Epub 201 1 Sep 2), Nitric oxide, neo- emulsions; ozone, lytic bacteriophages, lactoferrin, xylitol hydrogel, synthetic iron chelators, cranberry components, curcumin, silver nanoparticles, Acetyl- 1 1 - keto-P-boswellic acid (AKBA), barley coffee components, probiotics, sinefungin, S- adenosylmethionine, S- adenosyl-homocysteine, Delisea furanones, N-sulfonyl homoserine lactones and/or macro lide antibiotics or any combination thereof. Alternatively, the solution of the invention may be used in conjunction with (e.g., simultaneously, before or after) administration of a biofilm-disrupting compound. A biofilm-disrupting compound may be administered towards the end of ingestion of the solution of the invention, or shortly after completion of ingestion of the solution of the invention, so as to disrupt the biofilm most just before the colonoscopy. (viii) Organic acids Some of the osmotic load of the solution of the invention may be provided by an organic acid or salts of an organic acid other than ascorbic acid. For example, citric acid and/or salts thereof may replace some or all of the ascorbate in solutions of the invention. Throughout this description, ascorbic acid may be replaced with citric acid. A salt of ascorbate may be replaced with the salt of citrate. Sodium citrate, potassium citrate and magnesium citrate are particularly preferred. c Uses of solutions of the invention The solutions of the invention find use in cleansing the colon or bowel. They are also useful in the treatment of faecal impaction or constipation. When carrying out a colon or bowel cleansing treatment, a subject typically takes a single dose or a split dose of cleansing solution. In a split-dose treatment, typically two doses are taken separated by a time interval, for example an overnight interval. Alternatively, in a split-dose treatment two doses may be taken on the same day, for example during the day before a diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedure, or during the day of a diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedure. Each dose in a split dose treatment is smaller than the dose in the single dose treatment. In a split dose treatment, the two doses may each have the same composition, or they may be different. For a single dose treatment, the solution of the invention may be ingested in a volume of 700 to 1500ml. For example, the subject may ingest from 750ml to 1300ml of the solution, for example 800 to 1200ml, for example 900 to 1100 ml, for example 1000ml. For example 33 or 34 US fluid ounces may be ingested. In an embodiment, the subject may ingest some additional clear fluid. The additional clear fluid may be ingested after ingesting the solution of the invention. Alternatively, the additional clear fluid may be co-administered with the intake of the solution of the invention. By "coadministered" is meant the coordinated ingestion of a solution of the invention with additional clear fluid; that is to say that the subject ingests some of the solution of the invention but not necessarily the whole dose, then some additional clear fluid and then more solution of the invention. For a split dose treatment, the solution of the invention may be taken as one or both of the doses, each dose having a volume of 200 to 1000ml. For example, the subject may ingest (as one of the doses) 300ml to 1000ml of the solution, for example 300ml to 900ml, for example 300ml to 800ml, for example 400ml to 700ml, for example 400 to 600ml, for example 450 to 550 ml, for example 500ml. For example 16 or 17 US fluid ounces may be ingested. The combined volume of the first and second doses is preferably less than 2 litres. Preferably, it is 1750ml or less, for example 1500ml or less, for example 1250ml or less. For most adult subjects, a combined volume of more than 500ml is used, for example more than 750ml. For example, a combined volume of from 500ml to 1750ml is used, for example from 750ml to 1500ml, for example from 1000ml to 1500ml, for example 1000ml or 1250ml. For example the first dose may have a volume of 500ml (for example a volume of 16 or 17 US fluid ounces) or 750ml (for example a volume of 25 or 26 US fluid ounces) and the second dose may have a volume of 500ml (for example a volume of 16 or 17 US fluid ounces). In an embodiment, the subject may ingest some additional clear fluid with each or either dose of colon cleansing solution. The additional clear fluid may be taken after ingesting a dose of the solution. Alternatively, the additional clear fluid may be co-administered with the intake of a dose of the solution of the invention; that is to say that the subject ingests some of the solution of the invention but not necessarily the whole dose, then some clear fluid and then more solution of the invention. In the method, there is typically a time interval between ingesting the first dose and ingesting the second dose. Generally, the time interval is at least 4 hours, for example 6 hours or more, for example 8 hours or more. Typically, the time interval is less than 15 hours. The time interval between starting to take the first dose and starting to take the second dose may be, for example, the time between an evening and the following morning, for example 12 to 16 hours, for example 14 hours. For example, the subject may sleep (for example overnight) between taking the first and second doses. Alternatively, the time interval between ingesting the first dose and ingesting the second dose can be at least 10 minutes, for example from 10 minutes to 4 hours, for example from 30 minutes to 4 hours, for example from 30 minutes to two hours. For example, the subject may ingest the first and second colon cleansing doses the evening before a surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic procedure (hereinafter "procedure"). For example, the subject may ingest the first and second colon cleansing doses on the day of a procedure. The time interval between ingesting the first solution and ingesting the second solution can be determined by the time it takes for the subject to experience a bowel movement. For example the subject takes the second dose when the first bowel movement has occurred after completing ingestion of the first solution. Alternatively, the subject ingests the second dose when the first bowel movement has occurred even if ingestion of the first dose is not complete. As mentioned above, in a split-dose treatment two doses may be taken on the same day, for example during the day before a procedure, or during the day of a procedure. The overall process is thus typically the sequence: t=0: the subject takes a first dose of cleansing solution over a time t(dl), optionally followed by additional clear fluid over a time t(cfl ); t=ti: the subject takes a second dose of cleansing solution over a time t(d2), optionally followed by additional clear fluid over a time t*(cf2); t= t2: the subject undergoes the surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic procedure. Each dose of cleansing solution is generally taken over a period of from 10 minutes to 90 minutes, for example froml5 minutes to 1 hour, for example from 20 minutes to 45 minutes, typically 30 minutes. Thus t(dl) is for example 10 to 90 minutes, for example 15 minutes to 1 hour, for example 20 to 45 minutes, typically 30 minutes. Similarly, t(d2) is for example 10 to 90 minutes, for example 15 minutes to 1 hour, for example 20 to 45 minutes, typically 30 minutes. Each drink of additional clear fluid is generally taken over a period of from 10 minutes to 90 minutes, for example froml5 minutes to 1 hour, for example from 20 minutes to 45 minutes, typically 30 minutes. Thus t(cfl) is for example 10 to 90 minutes, for example 15 minutes to 1 hour, for example 20 to 45 minutes, typically 30 minutes. Similarly, t(cf2) is for example 10 to 90 minutes, for example 15 minutes to 1 hour, for example 20 to 45 minutes, typically 30 minutes. On some occasions, a subject may take some of the additional clear fluid before completing the ingestion of the cleansing solution (for example the two solutions might be interspersed). In that situation, t(dl) and t(cfl) may not be distinct. t(dl) + t(cfl) is thus for example 20 minutes to 3 hours, for example 30 minutes to 2 hours, for example 40 to 90 minutes, typically 1 hour. In general, the surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic procedure is carried out within 36 hours (for example within 24 hours) of the start of the colon cleansing. That is to say that t2 is generally less than 36 hours, for example less than 24 hours, for example less than 20 hours, for example less than 19, less than 18, less than 17, less than 16, less than 15, less than 14, less than 13, less than 12, less than 11, less than 10, less than 9, less than 8, less than 7, less than 6, less than 5, less than 4 or less than 3 hours. Where the colon cleansing procedure is started on the day before the surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic procedure, t2 is in the range of from 10 to 36 hours; for example from 12 to 24 hours; for example from 12 to 18 hours; for example from 12 to 16 hours. Where the colon cleansing procedure is started (and completed) on the day of the surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic procedure, t2 is in the range of from 3 to 14 hours; for example from 3 to 12 hours, for example from 4 to 10 hours, for example from 4 to 8 hours. The second dose of cleansing solution is generally taken after an interval after the completion of the first additional clear fluid. The length of the interval t(dose interval) may be expressed as: t(dose interval) = ti - (t(dl) + t(cfl)). As mentioned above, the subject may ingest the first and second doses the evening before a surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic procedure; or the subject may ingest the first and second doses on the day of a surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic procedure. In either of those circumstances, t(dose interval) is in the range of from 0 minutes to 8 hours, for example from 10 minutes to 4 hours, for example from 30 minutes to 4 hours, for example from 30 minutes to two hours, for example one hour or two hours. That is to say that both doses are taken on the same day. As mentioned above, alternatively, the subject may ingest the first dose in the evening on the day before a surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic procedure, and may ingest the second dose in the morning on the day of the surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic procedure. In that circumstance, t(dose interval) is in the range of from 8 to 20 hours, for example 10 to 16 hours, for example 10 to 14 hours, for example 12 hours. The t(dose interval) may, for example, be selected from 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 hours. The surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic procedure is generally carried out after an interval after the completion of the second additional clear fluid. The length of the interval t(procedure interval) may be expressed as: t(procedure interval) = t2 - (ti + t(d2) + t(cf2)). t(procedure interval) should be long enough for sufficient fluid to have passed through the colon to cleanse it satisfactorily for a colonoscopy examination or other diagnostic procedure, or a therapeutic or surgical procedure to be carried out. For example, it should be long enough for colonic effluent to be clear. For a regimen in which both doses are taken on the day of the surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic procedure, or for a regimen in which the second dose is taken on the day of the surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic procedure, t(procedure interval) is from 30 minutes to 10 hours, for example from 1 to 8 hours, for example from 1 to 6 hours. For a regimen in which both doses are taken on the day before the surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic procedure, t(procedure interval) is from 8 to 20 hours, for example from 9 to 18 hours, for example from 10 to 16 hours. The t(procedure interval) may, for example, be selected from 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1 hours. The invention thus provides a method of cleaning the colon of a subject before a surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic procedure, in which the subject takes two doses of colon cleansing solution whereby the first colon cleansing solution is taken over a time period t(dl) followed by optional additional clear fluid over a time period t(cfl), and then following a time interval t(dose interval), the second colon cleansing solution is taken over a time period t(d2) followed by optional additional clear fluid over a time period t(cf2), whereby the subject undergoes the surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic procedure at a time t2 after the beginning of the colon cleansing method, and whereby the time interval after the completion of the second additional clear fluid and the start of the surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic procedure is t(procedure interval). In particular, the invention provides a method in which: A) t2 is in the range of from 10 to 36 hours (for example from 12 to 24 hours, for example from 12 to 16 hours); t(dose interval) is in the range of from 0 minutes to 8 hours (for example from 30 minutes to 4 hours, for example one hour or two hours); and t(procedure interval) is from 8 to 20 hours (for example from 10 to 16 hours). B) t2 is in the range of from 10 to 36 hours (for example from 12 to 24 hours, for example from 12 to 16 hours); t(dose interval) is in the range of 8 to 20 hours (for example 10 to 14 hours); and t(procedure interval) is from 30 minutes to 10 hours (for example from 1 to 6 hours). C) t2 is in the range of from 3 to 14 hours (for example from 4 to 10 hours); t(dose interval) is in the range of from 0 minutes to 8 hours (for example from 30 minutes to 4 hours, for example one hour or two hours); and t(procedure interval) is from 30 minutes to 10 hours (for example from 1 to 6 hours). In each of regimens A), B) and C), t(dl) is 15 minutes to 1 hour (for example 30 minutes), t(cfl) is 15 minutes to 1 hour (for example 30 minutes), t(d2) is 15 minutes to 1 hour (for example 30 minutes) and t(cf2) is 15 minutes to 1 hour (for example 30 minutes). Preferably, the second colon cleansing solution is a solution of the invention described above in section 2, or as described below in section 4. The first colon cleansing solution may be the same as the second solution, or it may be different, as set out herein. During the ingestion of the first or second dose, or during the time interval between the ingestion of the first dose and the second dose, the subject may additionally take a stimulant laxative (also known as a prokinetic agent). A stimulant laxative can assist in bringing about good cleansing. Examples of stimulant laxatives include contact laxatives, for example bisacodyl, castor oil, senna or bisoxatin. Examples of stimulant laxatives also include additional osmotic agents for example magnesium salts, for example magnesium citrate. If a stimulant laxative is included in the regimen, the length of the time interval can be shortened. For example, it may be 10 minutes to 15 hours, for example 1 to 15 hours, for example 1 to 12 hours, for example 2 to 10 hours. During the time interval between the administration of the first dose and the second dose, it is very likely that the subject will experience a bowel movement. Advantageously, the subject waits until the bowel movement has occurred before taking the second dose. In a split dose treatment, the solution of the invention may be taken for one or for both of the doses. Preferably, the solution of the invention is taken as the second dose. For example, the subject may ingest 300ml to 1000ml of the solution of the invention as the second dose, for example 300ml to 900ml, for example 300ml to 800ml, for example 400ml to 700ml, for example 400 to 600ml, for example 450 to 550 ml, for example 500ml. For example 16 or 17 US fluid ounces may be ingested. The first dose of a split dose treatment may be a solution of different constitution from the second dose. Thus, in a preferred embodiment of a split dose colon cleansing treatment, a subject takes a dose of an initial cleansing solution, optionally followed by some additional clear fluid. After an interval, the subject then takes a dose of the solution of the invention, optionally followed by some additional clear fluid. The volume of additional clear fluid that a subject ingests after the first or second dose may be in a range with a lower limit of 100ml, 200ml, 300ml, 400ml or 500ml. Preferably, the lower limit is 300ml, 400ml or 500ml. The volume may be in a range with an upper limit of 1200ml, 1100ml, 1000ml, 900ml or 800ml. For example the volume may be in the range 100ml to 1200ml, for example 200ml to 1100ml, for example 300ml to 1000ml, for example 500ml to 900ml, for example 1000ml, for example 875ml, for example 500ml to 800ml. For example the volume may be in the range 300 ml to 900 ml, for example 400 ml to 800 ml, for example 500 ml to 800 ml. The additional clear fluid may be ingested in a volume of at least 500 ml. For example it may be at least 16 or 17 US fluid ounces. The instructions provided to the subject may suggest that the additional clear fluid is ingested over a period of approximately one hour, for example in 150 to 200ml fractions every 15 to 20 minutes. The additional clear fluid may be taken after taking a dose of the solution. Alternatively, the additional clear fluid may be co-administered with the intake of a dose of the solution of the invention; for example, the subject may ingest clear fluid between fractions of the solution of the invention; for example the subject may ingest a cup of the solution of the invention, followed by a cup of additional clear fluid, followed by further cups of the solution of the invention. A clear fluid for taking as the additional clear fluid, or for use as the clear fluid when making up a solution, may be any fluid that allows inspection of colonic output. The clear fluid should also not impede inspection of the colon during the colonoscopy. Typically the clear fluid is a water-based beverage, including, for example, water, lemonade, cola drinks, cordial drinks, clear fruit juices and even clear alcohol-containing beverages, for example beer. It is desirable that the clear fluid does not contain substantial amounts of or essentially any dietary fibre, as such fibre interferes with the cleansing of the colon according to the present invention. Accordingly, fruit juices, for example orange juice and kiwi juice, and fruit "squashes" should be strained before use. Clear fruit cordials, for example lime cordial or tea (for example green tea), are generally suitable. In view of the desirability of avoiding drinks containing glucose, so as to reduce the risk of explosive concentrations of hydrogen or methane building up in the gut, "diet" drinks containing no or low sugar are especially suitable, for example liquid drinks for diabetics, diet Coke (RTM), diet lemonade, dietary carbonated drinks or dietary cordials. The most preferred clear fluid is water. Generally subjects are advised not to eat heavy meals before starting the colon cleansing treatment. A subject may be advised to fast for 12 hours (for example 10 hours, for example 8 hours, for example 6 hours) before starting the colon cleansing treatment. Alternatively, a subject may, for example, be advised to follow a "white diet" for a day before, or the day of the start of the colon cleansing procedure. In a "white diet", a subject is instructed to restrict food intake to white and cream- coloured foods. Foods that are allowed include chicken breast (without skin), fish fillets (without skin), eggs, cheeses, rice crackers, white bread, plain pasta, white rice, rice noodle, peeled potato, ice cream, butter, custard, mayonnaise, milk and white chocolate. White foods that are not allowed include coconut, onion, cauliflower, pears, parsnip, semolina, banana and popcorn. As a further alternative, a subject may be advised to consume only a light meal, for example plain yoghurt, during that period. The method of the invention may be used to cleanse the colon prior to carrying out a diagnostic, therapeutic or surgical procedure on the colon, rectum or anus or elsewhere in the abdomen in a subject. The subject is most preferably a human. The diagnostic or surgical procedure may, for example, be colonoscopy (such as cap-assisted colonoscopy and/or narrow-band colonoscopy), barium enema examination, sigmoidoscopy (for example flexible sigmoidoscopy) or colon surgery. The method of the invention may be a method of cleansing the colon prior to a surgical or diagnostic procedure comprising administering the first solution and then after a time interval administering the second solution prior to said procedure. The solutions, compositions and kits described herein also find use in the treatment of constipation and faecal impaction. They also find use in the treatment of severe bacterial infections of the bowel. The invention thus provides solutions, compositions and kits as described herein for use in the treatment of constipation or faecal impaction, or in the treatment of severe bacterial infections of the bowel. The invention also provides methods of treating constipation or faecal impaction, or in the treating severe bacterial infections of the bowel comprising administration of solutions as described herein. As mentioned above, the solutions of the invention find use in cleansing the colon. The invention provides, in a further aspect, a solution in water of: a) 300 to 800 mmol per litre ascorbate anion provided by a mixture of (i) ascorbic acid and (ii) one or more salts of ascorbic acid the components (i) and (ii) being present in a molar ratio of from 1 :4.5 to 1 :7.0; and b) optionally 10 to 200 g per litre polyethylene glycol, for use in cleansing the colon of a mammal. The solution for use in cleansing the colon of a mammal preferably comprises ascorbate anion in a concentration of: 300-700mmol per litre, for example 350-650mmol per litre, for example 450-600 mmol per litre. As set out above, the ascorbate anion is provided by a mixture of ascorbic acid and one or more salts of ascorbic acid. Preferred forms of the ascorbate component are as set out above in section 3a). In a preferred embodiment, PEG is present. Preferred forms of the PEG and preferred amounts thereof are as set out above in section 3a). The solution for use in cleansing the colon of a mammal may additionally comprise one or more of: c) one or more electrolytes; d) one or more alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphates; e) one or more flavouring agents; f) one or more sweeteners. For example, the solution for use in cleansing the colon of a mammal additionally comprises elements c), e) and f) from that list. Preferred electrolytes and preferred amounts thereof are as set out above in section 3a). Preferred alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphates and preferred amounts thereof are as set out above in section 3a).

For example, the solution in water comprises: a) 150 to 400 mmol ascorbate anion, provided by a mixture of (i) ascorbic acid and (ϋ) one or more salts of ascorbic acid the components (i) and (ii) being present in a molar ratio of from 1 :4.5 to 1 :7.0; and b) optionally 5 to 100 g PEG. In particular, the invention provides a solution comprising: a) 150 to 400 mmol ascorbate anion, provided by a mixture of (i) ascorbic acid and (ii) one or more salts of ascorbic acid the components (i) and (ii) being present in a molar ratio of from 1 :4.5 to 1 :7.0; b) 5 to 100 g PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da; c) sodium chloride and potassium chloride; d) optionally sodium sulphate; e) optionally one or more flavouring agents; and f) optionally one or more sweeteners for use in cleansing the colon of a mammal. Each of c) and d) may be as described above and/or be present in the amounts described above in section 3a). Each of e) and f) may be as described above and/or be in the amounts described above section 3a). In particular, the invention provides a solution consisting essentially of: a) (i) 14 to 16g per litre ascorbic acid and (ϋ) 92 to lOOg per litre sodium ascorbate b) 75 to 85 per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da; c) 6.0 to 6.8g per litre sodium chloride and 2.0 to 2.8g per litre potassium chloride; e) one or more flavouring agents; and f) one or more sweeteners, for use in cleansing the colon of a mammal. Each of c) and d) may be as described above and/or be present in the amounts described above in section 3a). Each of e) and f) may be as described above and/or be in the amounts described above section 3a). For example, the invention provides a solution consisting essentially of: a) (i) 15.08g per litre ascorbic acid and (ii) 96.22g per litre sodium ascorbate b) 80g per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da; c) 6.4g per litre sodium chloride and 2.4g per litre potassium chloride; e) one or more flavouring agents; and f) one or more sweeteners, for use in cleansing the colon of a mammal.

For example, the flavouring and sweetener may be 3.20g per litre citrus flavour and 1.75g per litre aspartame. For example, the flavouring and sweetener may be 4.20g per litre orange grapefruit flavour and 1.75g per litre aspartame. As mentioned above, a colon cleansing treatment typically involves a subject taking a single dose or a split dose of cleansing solution. The volume of solution that a subject takes in a single dose treatment is described hereinabove. The subject may take some additional clear fluid after taking the solution as described hereinabove. The volume of solution that a subject takes in a split dose treatment is described hereinabove. The subject may take some additional clear fluid after each or either dose the solution as described hereinabove. d) Compositions for preparing doses of solutions The invention further provides a composition (for example a dry composition, for example a powder) for the preparation of a solution of the invention. A composition can be in a quantity for the preparation of a dose of the solution, for example a 500ml dose (for example a 16 or 17 US fluid ounce dose). The invention provides a composition for admixture with water, wherein the composition is optionally presented in two or more parts and comprises: a) 150 to 400 mmol ascorbate anion provided by a mixture of: (i) ascorbic acid and (ϋ) one or more salts of ascorbic acid the components (i) and (ii) being present in a molar ratio of from 1 :4.5 to 1 :7.0; and b) 5 to 100 g polyethylene glycol. For example, the components may be in dry powder, granular or other dry form. They may alternatively be in the form of concentrates or slurries. Components may be in the same or different physical forms. For example, the composition is a dry composition, for example a dry powder composition. For example, one or both of components a) and b) are dry powders. In a dry powder, it is possible for one or more components to be a salt hydrate. As set out above in section 3 a), the ascorbate anion is provided by a mixture of ascorbic acid and one or more salts of ascorbic acid. Preferred forms of the ascorbate component are as set out above in relation to solutions of the invention. The composition of the invention preferably comprises ascorbate anion in an amount of 150 to 350mmol, for example 175-325mmol, for example 225-300 mmol. Ascorbic acid has a molecular weight of 176g/mol and sodium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 198g/mol. Accordingly, the 150 to 400 mmol ascorbate anion can be provided by 3.3 to 12.8g ascorbic acid and 24.3 to 69g sodium ascorbate, for example 5.0 to lOg ascorbic acid and 40 to 60g sodium ascorbate; for example 6.0 to lOg ascorbic acid and 40 to 60g sodium ascorbate; for example 7.0 to 8.0g ascorbic acid and 44 to 52g sodium ascorbate; for example 7.0 to 8.0g ascorbic acid and 46 to 50g sodium ascorbate. Potassium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 214g/mol. Accordingly, the 150 to 400 mmol ascorbate anion can be provided by 3.3 to 12.8g ascorbic acid and 26 to 75g potassium ascorbate, for example 5.0 to lOg ascorbic acid and 45 to 65g potassium ascorbate; for example 7.0 to 8.0g ascorbic acid and 47 to 56g sodium ascorbate. Magnesium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 374.5g/mol and each mole of magnesium ascorbate provides two moles of ascorbate. Accordingly, the 150 to 400 mmol ascorbate anion can be provided by 3.3 to 12.8g ascorbic acid and 23 to 65g magnesium ascorbate, for example 5.0 to lOg ascorbic acid and 38 to 57g magnesium ascorbate; for example 7.0 to 8.0g ascorbic acid and 42 to 49g magnesium ascorbate. In solid form, ascorbic acid is typically made up of protonated free ascorbic acid. In calculations of concentrations of "ascorbate anion" herein, the number of moles of "ascorbate anion" is taken as the total concentration of all ascorbate anion present, including the proportion that is protonated. The weight of the ascorbate component may be 20 to 85g, for example 25 to 75g, for example 20 to 60g, for example 50 to 60g. In an embodiment, the ascorbate component comprises (or consists essentially of) sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid.

Detailed description II This section describes in further detail the solutions set out in section 4 immediately above. a) Contents of solutions The solutions of the invention are aqueous solutions. Suitable salts of ascorbic acid include alkali metal salts and alkaline earth metal salts. For example a salt may be selected from sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium salts. For example, preferred salts of ascorbic acid include sodium ascorbate, potassium ascorbate, magnesium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate. Particularly preferred salts of ascorbic acid are magnesium ascorbate and sodium ascorbate, for example sodium ascorbate. In one embodiment, the solution comprises sodium ascorbate and no further ascorbate. The solution of the invention preferably comprises ascorbate anion in a concentration of: 370- 430mmol per litre, for example 380-420mmol per litre, for example 400-410 mmol per litre. A solution of the invention may comprise 72 to 88g/litre of ascorbate salt. For example, a solution of the invention comprises 75 to 85g/litre, for example 78 to 82g/litre, for example 80g/litre. Sodium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 198g/mol. Accordingly, a solution of the invention may comprise sodium ascorbate at 71.3 - 87. lg per litre, for example 73.3-85. lg per litre for example 75.2-83.2g per litre, for example 79.2-80.2g per litre. Potassium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 214g/mol. Accordingly, a solution of the invention may comprise potassium ascorbate at 77.0-94.2g per litre, 79.2-92. Og per litre, for example 81.3-89.9g per litre, for example 85.6-86.7g per litre. Magnesium ascorbate has a molecular weight of 374.5g/mol and each mole of magnesium ascorbate provides two moles of ascorbate. Accordingly, a solution of the invention may comprise magnesium ascorbate at 67.4-82.4g per litre, for example 69.3-80.5g per litre, for example 71.2-78.6g per litre, for example 74.9-75.8g per litre. Depending on the pH of the solution, some ascorbate anion may be protonated and thus exist as free ascorbic acid in solution. At the pH of solutions that would typically be administered, only a minor proportion of ascorbate is protonated. In calculations of concentrations of "ascorbate anion" herein, the concentration of "ascorbate anion" is taken as the total concentration of all ascorbate anion present, including the proportion that is protonated. The cleansing solution comprises polyethylene glycol. The polyethylene glycol (PEG) may be as described above in section 3a). The cleansing solution comprises 10 to 200 g per litre of PEG. Preferably, the solution comprises 20 to 160g per litre of PEG, more preferably 40 to 120 g per litre, for example 60 to 100 g per litre, for example 75 to 85 g per litre, for example 80 g per litre. The cleansing solution may additionally comprise one or more of: c) one or more electrolytes; d) one or more alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphates; e) one or more flavouring agents; f) one or more sweeteners. The cleansing solution may comprise one or more electrolytes. Electrolytes include salts of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, particularly sodium and potassium; and salts of chloride, iodide, bicarbonate and carbonate, particularly chloride. Preferred electrolytes are sodium chloride and potassium chloride. In an embodiment, the solution is essentially free from sodium bicarbonate, for example essentially free from any bicarbonate. For example, the solution may comprise sodium chloride at a concentration of 1 to 10 g per litre. For example, sodium chloride may be present at a concentration of 3 to 8 g per litre, for example 4 to 7g per litre; for example 4.5 to 5.5g per litre; for example 5.0g per litre or 5.6g per litre. For example, the solution may comprise potassium chloride at a concentration of 1 to 10 g per litre. For example, potassium chloride may be present at a concentration of 1 to 7 g per litre, for example 1.5 to 5g per litre, for example 1.5 to 3g per litre, for example 1.7 to 2.8 g per litre; for example 1.8g per litre or 2.6g per litre. In an embodiment, the solution comprises sodium chloride and potassium chloride. They can be present in the amounts mentioned immediately above. For example, sodium chloride may be present at a concentration of 4 to 7g per litre and potassium chloride may be present at a concentration of 1.5 to 3g per litre. The cleansing solution may comprise one or more alkali metal sulphates, alkaline earth metal sulphates or a mixture thereof (herein referred to as a "sulphate component"). The sulphate component and the quantity thereof may be as described above in section 3a). In an alternative preferred embodiment, the solution does not comprise a sulphate component; that is to say that the solution is essentially free from alkali metal sulphates and alkaline earth metal sulphates; in particular essentially free from sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate and magnesium sulphate. In the solutions of the invention described herein, the quantities of the individual components recited do not include any solutes that may be present in the water used to prepare the solutions, for example, in hard water areas there may be significant amounts of Ca2+ and Mg2+ carbonates, bicarbonates or sulphates present in tap water. The cleansing solution preferably includes a flavouring agent. The flavouring may be as described above in section 3a). Lemon/lime flavour and orange flavour are particularly preferred. The amount of flavouring required depends on the nature and strength of the flavouring in question. Typically, it is 0.05 to 4.5 g per litre, for example 0.05 to 2.0 g per litre, for example 0.5 to 1.8g per litre, for example 2.5 to 4.5g per litre, for example 0.6g per litre or 1.6g per litre, for example 3.2 or 4.3g per litre. The cleansing solution preferably includes a sweetener. The sweetener may be as described above in section 3a). Alternatively, compositions of the invention can be essentially free from added sweeteners, for example to minimize the number of different components in the compositions. A souring agent (for example citric acid) may be present as a taste enhancer. A souring agent is a component that imparts a sourness to a composition. Other souring agents include malic acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, gluconodeltalactone, phosphoric acid, succinic acid, phytic acid, lactic acid or salts thereof. The souring agent (for example citric acid) may be provided in an encapsulated form. The encapsulation provides a coating that isolates the souring agent from other components and from air and moisture prior to its use. Several encapsulated forms of citric acid, or other souring agents, are commercially available. For example, the encapsulation may be with a water-soluble coating. The amount of sweetener required depends on the nature and strength of the sweetener being considered. Typically, it is 0.10 to 4 g per litre. For example, the sweetener may be aspartame at 0.5 to 4g per litre, for example 2.5 to 4.0 g per litre, for example 2.0g per litre, for example 2.2g per litre or 3.25g per litre. Those quantities of aspartame are particularly suitable when used with orange flavouring, for example orange flavouring at 0.2 to 1.8g per litre, for example 0.5 to 1.8g per litre, for example 0.6g per litre or 1.6g per litre or 3.25g per litre. The invention thus provides a colon cleansing solution comprising: a) 360 to 440 mmol per litre ascorbate anion provided by one or more salts of ascorbic acid; b) 10 to 200 g per litre PEG; c) one or more electrolytes; d) optionally one or more alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphates; e) optionally one or more flavouring agents; and f) optionally one or more sweeteners; the solution being essentially free from ascorbic acid.

In an embodiment, the first colon cleansing solution may be a solution as commercialised under the tradename MOVIPREP® or a solution as commercialised under the tradename SUCLEAR®. The first colon cleansing solution preferably includes a flavouring agent. The first colon cleansing solution preferably includes a sweetener. Flavouring agents and sweeteners may be as described hereinabove. For example, a flavouring for use in in the first colon cleansing solution should preferably mask saltiness, be relatively sweet but not excessively so, and be stable in the composition. A flavouring makes the solutions more palatable and thus aids patient compliance. Preferred flavourings include lemon e.g. Ungerer Lemon (available from Ungerer Limited, Sealand Road, Chester, England CHI 4LP) strawberry e.g. Ungerer Strawberry, grapefruit e.g. Ungerer Grapefruit flavouring powder, blackcurrant e.g. Ungerer Blackcurrant, pineapple e.g. IFF (International Flavours and Fragrances) Pineapple flavouring powder, orange eg Firmenich Orange, and vanilla/lemon and lime e.g. IFF Vanilla and Givaudin Roure Lemon and Lime Flav-o-lok, fruit punch eg Ungerer fruit punch, citrus punch, mango, and berry. Those and further suitable flavourings are available from International Flavours and Fragrances Inc. (Duddery Hill, Haverhill, Suffolk, CB9 8LG, England), Ungerer & Company (Sealand Road, Chester, England CHI 4LP) or Firmenich (Firmenich UK Ltd., Hayes Road, Southall, Middlesex UB2 5NN). More preferred flavourings are lemon, kiwi, strawberry grapefruit, fruit punch and mango. Fruit punch and mango are especially preferred flavours. A particularly preferred flavouring is fruit punch flavour, for example at a level of 0.4 to 3.5g per litre, for example 0.4 to 1.2g per litre, for example 0.938, 1.0 or 3.18g per litre. The first cleansing solution preferably includes a sweetener. Preferred sweeteners include aspartame, acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K), sucralose and saccharine, and/ or combinations thereof. For example, the solution may comprise one or both of aspartame and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K). For example, it may comprise one or both of sucralose and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K). In a preferred embodiment, the solution comprises aspartame or sucralose, for example sucralose. Preferred sweeteners include aspartame, acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K), sucralose and saccharine, and/ or combinations thereof. For example, compositions of the invention may comprise one or both of aspartame and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K). For example, compositions of the invention may comprise one or both of sucralose and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K). In a preferred embodiment, the solution comprises aspartame or sucralose, for example aspartame. Alternatively, compositions of the invention can be essentially free from added sweeteners, for example to minimize the number of different components in the compositions. A souring agent (for example citric acid) may be present as a taste enhancer. A souring agent is a component that imparts a sourness to a composition. Other souring agents include malic acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, gluconodeltalactone, phosphoric acid, succinic acid, phytic acid, lactic acid or salts thereof. It may be present at a level of from 0.1 to 3.0 g per litre, for example 0.3 to 2.0 g per litre, for example 0.5 to 2.0g per litre, for example 0.75g, l.Og, 1.06g, 1.25g or 1.5g per litre. The souring agent (for example citric acid) may be provided in an encapsulated form. The encapsulation provides a coating that isolates the souring agent from other components and from air and moisture prior to its use. Several encapsulated forms of citric acid, or other souring agents, are commercially available. For example, the encapsulation may be with a water-soluble coating. The amount of sweetener required depends on the nature and strength of the sweetener being considered. Typically, it is 0.10 to 4 g per litre. For example, the sweetener may be sucralose at 0.1 to 3.0g per litre, for example 0.3 to 2.0 g per litre, for example 0.5 to 2.0g per litre, for example 0.5 to 1.3g per litre for example 0.63g, 0.80g, l .Og or 1.58g per litre. The first cleansing solution may include one or more further optional components. Such components may be as set out above in section 3b). In an embodiment, the first colon cleansing solution has a volume of from 400 to 600ml (for example 500ml), and contains the quantities of solutes described in the section immediately above. For example the volume may be 16 or 17 US fluid ounces. For example, the invention provides colon cleansing solution comprising : (i) 175 to 220 g per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 2500 to 4500 Da. (ii) 15 to 20 g per litre of one or more alkali metal sulphates, alkaline earth metal sulphates or a mixture thereof (iii) 3.0 to 5.0 g per litre sodium chloride, and 1.5 to 2.5 g per litre potassium chloride; (iv) optionally one or more flavouring agents; and (v) optionally one or more sweeteners. Such a solution has a smaller volume than cleansing solutions that are generally used. In an embodiment, the first colon cleansing solution is provided in a volume of from 300ml up to 1200ml. For example, the first solution may have a volume in a range with a lower limit of 300ml, 400ml, 500ml, 600ml or 700ml. Preferably, the lower limit is 500ml, 600ml or 700ml. The volume may be in a range with an upper limit of 1200ml, 1100ml, 1000ml, 900ml or 800ml. For example the volume may be in the range 400ml to 1100ml, for example 500ml to 1000ml, for example 600ml to 900ml, for example 700ml to 800ml. For example, the first colon cleansing solution is provided in a volume of 750ml. For example the volume may be in the range 400ml to 600ml. For example, the first colon cleansing solution is provided in a volume of 500ml. For example it may be in a volume of 16 or 17 US fluid ounces. The most appropriate volume will depend on the exact components of the solution and the amounts in which they are present. In general, for a solution of higher osmotic strength, a smaller volume will be required. The first cleansing solution may, for example, have a measured osmolality in the range 200 to 2000 mOsmol/kg, 200 to 1500 mOsmol/kg. In a preferred embodiment, it is hyper-osmotic. It may, for example have a measured osmolality in the range 320 to 1500 mOsmol. For example, the measured osmolality of the first cleansing solution is in the range 330 to 1200 mOsmol/kg, for example 340 to 1000 mOsmol/kg, for example 350 to 800 mOsmol/kg, for example 350 to 700 mOsmol/kg. For example, the solutes in the solution may have a V(350) value of from 800 to 1600ml, for example from 1000 to 1400ml, for example from 1150 to 1250ml, and be in a volume of 400 to 600ml, for example 500ml. The invention further provides a composition optionally presented in two or more parts for the preparation of a first colon cleansing solution. For example the composition may comprise: (i) 87.5 to 110 g PEG having an average molecular weight of 2500 to 4500 Da. (ii) 7.5 to 10 g of one or more alkali metal sulphates, alkaline earth metal sulphates or a mixture thereof (iii) 1.5 to 2.5g sodium chloride and 0.75 to 1.25g potassium chloride; (iv) optionally one or more flavouring agents; and (v) optionally one or more sweeteners. For example the composition may comprise: (i) 100 g PEG having an average molecular weight of 3000 to 4000 Da. (ii) 9.0 g sodium sulphate (iii) 2.0g sodium chloride and 1.0g potassium chloride; (iv) optionally one or more flavouring agents; and (v) optionally one or more sweeteners. For example, the flavouring and sweetener may be 0.469g fruit punch flavouring, 0.476g sucralose and 0.792g citric acid. For example, the flavouring and sweetener may be 0.500g fruit punch flavouring, 0.40g sucralose and 0.75g citric acid. For example, the flavouring and sweetener may be 1.43g mango flavouring, 0.79g sucralose and 1.74g citric acid. For example, the flavouring and sweetener may be 1.59g fruit punch flavouring, 0.79g sucralose and 1.74g citric acid. Citric acid may optionally be packaged separately from the other components. Particular first solutions SI and S2, and particular second solutions Tl and T2 are described in the examples section below. In a preferred aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of cleansing the colon of a subject comprising (or consisting essentially of): administering to the subject a cleansing solution of S2 as set forth herein; administering to the subject a cleansing solution of Tl as set forth herein. In preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention, the cleansing solution of S2 is administered to the subject before the cleansing solution of Tl is administered. It is particularly preferred that S2 is administered to the subject and then, following a time interval (such as disclosed herein), Tl is administered to the subject. In further preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention, additional fluid (such as clear fluid) is administered to the subject in conjunction with S2 and/or Tl . For example, additional clear fluid (such as 500ml or thereabout, or 1000ml or thereabout) is administered to the subject following administration of S2 and/or Tl . Alternatively, additional clear fluid is administered to the subject during administration of S2 and/or Tl. In typical embodiments, the cleansing solution of S2 and/or Tl is self-administered. 7. Use of sweetener in colon cleansing solution It has been found by the current inventors that a sulphate-containing colon cleansing solution that contains a souring agent (for example citric acid) and sucralose is particularly palatable. The invention further provides, according to a fourth aspect, a colon cleansing solution comprising: (i) 70 to 250 g per litre PEG having an average molecular weight of 2500 to 4500 Da; (ii) 2.0 to 20 g per litre of one or more alkali metal sulphates, alkaline earth metal sulphates or a mixture thereof; (iii 1) optionally 1.0 to 5.0 g per litre sodium chloride; (iii 2) optionally 0.5 to 1.5 (for example 0.5 to 1.1) g per litre potassium chloride; (iv) optionally one or more flavouring agents; (v) sucralose; and (vi) one or more souring agents. Further, the invention provides a method for improving the palatability of a sulphate-containing colon cleansing solution comprising including in the solution 0.1 to 3.0g per litre sucralose and 0.1 to 4.0g per litre of souring agent, for example 0.1 to 3.0 g per litre of souring agent, for example citric acid. The invention provides a method for diminishing the poor taste of a sulphate-containing colon cleansing solution comprising including in the solution 0.1 to 3.0g per litre sucralose and 0.1 to 4.0gof souring agent, for example 0.1 to 3.0 g per litre of souring agent, for example citric acid. It is postulated that the improved palatability is associated with a reduced perceived saltiness of the solutions. The invention thus provides a method for reducing the perceived saltiness of a sulphate- containing colon cleansing solution comprising including in the solution 0.1 to 3.0g per litre sucralose and 0.1 to 4.0g per litre of souring agent, for example 0.1 to 3.0 g per litre of souring agent, for example citric acid. "Reduction" here is taken to mean as compared with an equivalent solution without the sucralose and souring agent. A souring agent may be selected from citric acid, malic acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, gluconodeltalactone, phosphoric acid, succinic acid, phytic acid, lactic acid or salts thereof. For example, the souring agent may be citric acid. It may be present at a level of from 0.1 to 4.0g per litre, for example 0.1 to 3.0 g per litre, for example 0.3 to 2.0 g per litre, for example 0.5 to 2.0g per litre, for example 0.75g, l.Og, 1.06g, 1.25g or 1.5g per litre. For example, it may be at a level of 3.0 to 4.0g per litre, for example 3.48g per litre. Citric acid, or another souring agent, may be provided in an encapsulated form. The encapsulation provides a coating that isolates the souring agent from other components and from air and moisture prior to its use. Several encapsulated forms of citric acid, or other souring agents, are commercially available. For example, the encapsulation may be with a water-soluble coating. The sucralose may, for example be present at a level of 0.1 to 3.0g per litre, for example 0.3 to 2.0 g per litre, for example 0.5 to 2.0g per litre, for example 0.5 to 1.3g per litre for example 0.63g, 0.80g, or 1.0g per litre. For example, it may be at a level of 1.58g per litre. When sucralose and citric acid are used, a particularly preferred flavouring is fruit punch flavour, for example at a level of 0.4 to 1.2g per litre, for example 0.625g per litre or l .Og per litre. There is also provided a composition for the preparation of such a solution, for example by admixture with water. Preferred amounts of each of components (i) to (iv) in the solutions and compositions of the fourth aspect of the invention are as set out for the first colon cleansing solutions and first colon cleansing compositions hereinabove in section 6b). A colon cleansing solution according to the fourth aspect of the invention may contain PEG, sulphate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride and flavouring in amounts and types as described hereinabove in relation to the first colon cleansing solution in section 6b). A colon cleansing solution according to the fourth aspect of the invention may be used together with a solution of the first or second aspect of the invention as set out in sections 2 to 5. Alternatively, it may be used in combination with a different other colon cleansing solution, or used in a suitable volume on its own. If used on its own, it may be used in a single dose or in a split dose administration. The invention provides a method of cleansing the colon of a subject comprising administering a solution of the fourth aspect of the invention. The solution may be administered on its own or in combination with a further, different, solution. 8.

In addition, in a container of the type disclosed in WO2012/105524, a powdered medicine, which has been stored in a separated state, can be simply and readily mixed at the time of use to provide an aqueous solution. For example, a multi-chambered container comprises a substantially flat pouch formed from a flexible film, a partition wall configured as a detachable seal detachably welding opposing inner surfaces of the pouch, and a pour port for infusion and discharge of a liquid, that is attached to the periphery of the pouch so as to open into one of the plurality of partitioned chambers. For example, the partition wall comprises a horizontal section which extends along a gusseted bottom section of the pouch and a perpendicular section which is curved from the horizontal section to a pouch upper section. The partition wall may, for example, be frangible. For example, a first partitioned chamber having a large capacity is formed on one side of the partition wall close to the bottom section of the pouch, a second partitioned chamber having a small capacity is formed on the other side of the partition wall, and the pour port opens into the first partitioned chamber. b) kits providing treatments according to the invention As set out above in section 6), the invention provides various split-dose treatments for colon cleansing in which the subject takes two different agents.

Preferably, the kit further comprises instructions for use. In an embodiment, a kit of the invention has instructions that instruct the user of the volume to which each component is to be made up with water. For example, the specified volume of water for each solution is less than one litre. For example, the specified volume for the first component may be 300ml to 1200ml, for example 600ml to 900ml, for example 750ml; for example it may be a volume of 25 or 26 US fluid ounces, for example 400 to 600ml, for example 500ml.

For example it may be a volume of 16 or 17 US fluid ounces. Further volumes that may be specified in the instructions are the volumes set out hereinabove in relation to the methods of the invention. In general, the instructions specify that the first and second solutions are to be ingested in succession with a time interval between them. In an embodiment, the instructions specify that the first cleansing solution is ingested first followed, after a time interval (for example the time between an evening and the following morning) by ingestion of the second cleansing solution. The time interval is preferably as described above in relation to the methods of the invention. The instructions may specify that the components in the kit be made up into solutions and then taken in accordance with the description set out above in section 6 for the first solution and sections 3c) and 5c) for the second solution. For example, components A) and B) may be in dry powder, granular or other dry form. They may alternatively be in the form of concentrates or slurries. Components A) and B) may be in the same or different physical forms. Components within A) and B) may be in the same or different physical forms. For example, one or both of components A) and B) are dry powders. A portion of either or each of components A) and B) may be in the form of one or more solid tablets or capsules. It is convenient for the patient for a kit of the invention to be provided in the form of, for example, a box. In a kit of the invention the first and/or second components may each contained in one or more containers. In particular, the second component may be contained in more than one container. For example, if the second component comprises both ascorbic acid and PEG then the ascorbic acid and PEG may be contained in separate containers. The other constituents of the second component (for example one or more of sodium chloride, potassium chloride and sodium sulphate) may be in either of the separate containers. For example, they may be in the container containing the PEG. If a flavouring component is present in the first or second solution, then in a kit of the invention, the flavouring component for the relevant solution may be provided in a separate container from the other constituents of that solution. Examples of suitable containers include tubs, bags and sachets. A preferred container is a sachet. In one embodiment, the composition of the invention can be provided in a multi-chambered container, for example of the type disclosed in WO2012/105524, as described above in section 8a). In one embodiment, a kit comprises: A) a first sachet comprising a first composition for the preparation of the first cleansing solution; Bl) a second sachet; B2) a third sachet; wherein the second and third sachets together provide a composition for the preparation of the second cleansing solution. For example, in a kit of the invention as mentioned immediately above: A) the first sachet comprises polyethylene glycol and/or sodium sulphate; Bl) the second sachet comprises one or more components selected from polyethylene glycol, one or more alkali metal sulphates, alkaline earth metal sulphates or a mixture thereof and electrolytes; and B2) the third sachet comprises one or more salts of ascorbic acid and, if appropriate, ascorbic acid; the contents of sachets (Bl) and (B2) together providing the components for the second cleansing solution. For example, in a further embodiment of a kit of the invention, rather than being provided within a first sachet (A) with the PEG, some or all of the sulphate(s), electrolytes, flavouring agents and sweeteners are provided in the form of a tablet or capsule. In a further embodiment of a kit of the invention, rather than being provided within a second or third sachet (B 1 or B2) with the PEG, ascorbic acid or ascorbate component, some or all of the sulphate(s), electrolytes, flavouring agents and sweeteners are provided in the form of a tablet or capsule. A kit may contain one treatment, for example a cleansing treatment, or several treatments. A treatment generally comprises one dose of the first cleansing solution (or components for preparing the first cleansing solution) and one dose of the second cleansing solution (or components for preparing the first cleansing solution). In a kit of the invention, preferably the first component comprises one dose of the first cleansing solution, and the second component comprises one dose of the second cleansing solution. A kit of the invention may be for use in a method of cleansing the colon comprising: - the subject taking an effective amount of a first colon cleansing solution as described herein; and then - the subject taking an effective amount of a second colon cleansing solution as described herein. 9. Alternative colon cleansing regimens a) general The solutions and compositions of the first and second aspects of the invention described above in sections 2 to 5 find further use in split dose colon cleansing treatments in which the subject takes two different solutions (a first colon cleansing solution, followed by a second colon cleansing solution) in which the solution of the first or second aspect of the invention is the first colon cleansing solution. In a fifth aspect, the invention thus provides a method of cleansing the colon of a mammal comprising: - the subject taking an effective amount of a first colon cleansing solution; and then - the subject taking an effective amount of a second colon cleansing solution, the first colon cleansing solution being a solution of the first or second aspect of the invention described above in sections 2 to 5. The invention also provides a method of cleansing the colon of a mammal comprising: - the subject taking an effective amount of a first colon cleansing solution; and then - the subject taking an effective amount of a second colon cleansing solution, the first colon cleansing solution being a solution comprising a) 300 to 800 mmol per litre ascorbate anion provided by a mixture of: (i) ascorbic acid and (ii) one or more salts of ascorbic acid the components (i) and (ii) being present in a molar ratio of from 1 :4.5 to 1 :7.0; and b) optionally 10 to 200 g per litre polyethylene glycol. The invention also provides a method of cleansing the colon of a mammal comprising: - the subject taking an effective amount of a first colon cleansing solution; and then - the subject taking an effective amount of a second colon cleansing solution, the first colon cleansing solution being a solution comprising a) 360 to 440 mmol per litre ascorbate anion provided by one or more salts of ascorbic acid; and b) optionally 10 to 200 g per litre polyethylene glycol; the solution being essentially free from ascorbic acid. The solutions and methods of the fifth aspect of the invention may have the features described above in relation to the solutions and methods of the third aspect of the invention as set out in section 6 above. b) alternative: The invention also provides a method of cleansing the colon of a subject comprising: - administering to the subject an effective amount of a first cleansing solution; and then after a time interval - administering to the subject an effective amount of a second cleansing solution, wherein the first cleansing solution is hyper-osmotic and contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof (for example ascorbic acid and sodium ascorbate, for example sodium ascorbate); and wherein the second cleansing solution is either substantially free from ascorbic acid and salts thereof, or contains ascorbic acid, one or more salts of ascorbic acid, or a mixture thereof, in an amount providing a lower concentration of ascorbate anion than is present in the first cleansing solution. The first cleansing solution may comprise PEG and electrolytes (for example sodium chloride and potassium chloride). The second solution may comprise PEG; it may comprise an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphate (for example sodium sulphate); it may comprise electrolytes (for example sodium chloride and potassium chloride). There are also provided kits comprising a first and a second solution according to the invention, and kits comprising compositions for preparing the first and second solutions. The first cleansing solution contains a higher concentration of ascorbate anion than is present in the second cleansing solution. For example, the first cleansing solution contains twice the concentration of the ascorbate anion than the second cleansing solution or more. For example, the first solution contains three times or more, four times or more, or five times or more the concentration of the ascorbate anion than the second cleansing solution. For example, the first cleansing solution contains a concentration of the ascorbate anion that is at least 50mmol per litre greater than that of the second cleansing solution. That is to say that the first solution contains a concentration of ascorbate anion that is at least 50mmol per litre greater than that of the second solution. For example, the first solution contains a concentration of the ascorbate anion that is greater by at least 1 OOmmol per litre, for example at least 200mmol per litre, at least 3 OOmmol per litre. For example, the second cleansing solution may be substantially free from an ascorbate component. For example, the first cleansing solution may comprise: - 56.6g sodium ascorbate, or - 33.9g sodium ascorbate and 20. lg ascorbic acid, or - 33.9g sodium ascorbate, or - 33.9g sodium ascorbate and 21.4 g magnesium ascorbate. The first cleansing solution may further comprise polyethylene glycol. The polyethylene glycol (PEG) may, for example, have an average molecular weight of 2500 to 4500 Da, for example 3000 to 4000 Da. For example, the PEG may be PEG 3350 or PEG 4000 as defined in national pharmacopeias. Further examples of suitable PEGs recognized in some national pharmacopeias include Macrogols, for example Macrogol 4000. For example, the first cleansing solution may comprise 20g or 40g PEG 3350. For example, the first cleansing solution may have a volume of 500ml. For example it may have a volume of 16 or 17 US fluid ounces. The second cleansing solution may comprise polyethylene glycol and/or an alkali metal sulphate, an alkaline earth metal sulphate, or a mixture thereof. The polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the second cleansing solution may be as described immediately above for the first cleansing solution. The PEG in the second cleansing solution can be a different PEG from the PEG in the second cleansing solution. For example, one PEG may be PEG3350 and the other PEG may be PEG4000. For example, the second cleansing solution may comprise lOOg PEG 3350. For example, the second cleansing solution may have a volume of 750ml. For example it may have a volume of 25 or 26 US fluid ounces. The second cleansing solution preferably comprises an alkali metal sulphate, an alkaline earth metal sulphate or a mixture thereof. An alkali metal or alkaline earth metal sulphate may, for example, be selected from sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate and magnesium sulphate. The solution may comprise more than one of sodium sulphate, potassium sulphate and magnesium sulphate, for example all three. Preferably, the alkali metal sulphate, an alkaline earth metal sulphate or the mixture thereof is or includes sodium sulphate. Preferably, an alkali metal sulphate or alkaline earth metal sulphate (for example sodium sulphate) is anhydrous. For example, the second cleansing solution may have a volume of 750ml and comprise 3g, 6g or 9g of sodium sulphate. The first and/or second cleansing solution(s) may further comprise one or more of: a) one or more electrolytes; b) one or more flavouring agents; c) one or more sweeteners. Electrolytes include salts of sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium, particularly sodium and potassium; and salts of chloride, iodide, bicarbonate and carbonate, particularly chloride. Preferred electrolytes are sodium chloride and potassium chloride. In an embodiment, the first and/or second solution is substantially free from sodium bicarbonate. For example, the second cleansing solution may have a volume of 750ml and comprise 1.4g sodium chloride and 0.3g potassium chloride; or 1.6g sodium chloride and 0.7g potassium chloride; or 2.0g sodium chloride and l .Og potassium chloride. For example, the first cleansing solution may have a volume of 500ml and comprise 3.5g sodium chloride and 2.2g potassium chloride; or 2.7g sodium chloride and 1.3g potassium chloride; or 2.8g sodium chloride and 1.3g potassium chloride; or 2.8g sodium chloride and 2.0g potassium chloride; or 3.1g sodium chloride and 1.3g potassium chloride. For example the first cleansing solution is substantially free from sodium bicarbonate. The first and/or second cleansing solution(s) preferably include a flavouring agent. Flavouring for use in compositions of the invention should preferably mask saltiness, be relatively sweet but not excessively so, and be stable in the composition. Flavouring makes the solutions more palatable and thus aids patient compliance. Preferred flavourings include lemon e.g. Ungerer Lemon (available from Ungerer Limited, Sealand Road, Chester, England CHI 4LP) strawberry e.g. Ungerer Strawberry, grapefruit e.g. Ungerer Grapefruit flavouring powder, blackcurrant e.g. Ungerer Blackcurrant, pineapple e.g. IFF (International Flavours and Fragrances) Pineapple flavouring powder, orange eg Firmenich Orange, vanilla/lemon and lime e.g. IFF Vanilla and Givaudin Roure Lemon and Lime Flav-o-lok, fruit punch eg Ungerer fruit punch, citrus punch, mango, and berry. Those and further suitable flavourings are available from International Flavours and Fragrances Inc. (Duddery Hill, Haverhill, Suffolk, CB9 8LG, England), Ungerer & Company (Sealand Road, Chester, England CHI 4LP) or Firmenich (Firmenich UK Ltd., Hayes Road, Southall, Middlesex UB2 5NN). More preferred flavourings are lemon, kiwi, strawberry, grapefruit, orange, fruit punch and mango. Fruit punch and mango are especially preferred flavourings for the first solution. The most preferred flavourings for the second solution are lemon flavour and orange flavour. The first and/or second cleansing solution(s) preferably include a sweetener. Sugar-based sweeteners are generally not suited for colon cleansing compositions because the delivery of unabsorbed sugars to the colon provides a substrate for bacteria. Such sugars may be metabolised by the bacteria to form explosive gases such as hydrogen and methane. The presence of explosive gases in the colon can be highly dangerous when electrical apparatus is to be used during colonoscopy or other procedures. Preferred sweeteners include aspartame, acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K), sucralose and saccharine, and/ or combinations thereof. For example, compositions of the invention may comprise one or both of aspartame and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K). For example, compositions of the invention may comprise one or both of sucralose and acesulfame potassium (acesulfame K). Alternatively, compositions of the invention can be substantially free from added sweeteners, for example to minimize the number of different components in the compositions. Citric acid may also be present as a taste enhancer. Examples General description of sample evaluation protocol The same sample evaluation protocol was used for the taste tests of all of the solutions described below that were taste tested. The protocol was as follows: 1. The solution was sipped from 1 oz cups, swished in the mouth, and expectorated. 2. Initial flavour was immediately evaluated (t=0). 3. The aftertaste was evaluated at periodic time intervals: 1, 3 and 5 minutes. 4. Upon completing the evaluation, the panellists cleansed their palates using spring water and unsalted crackers. The Panelists were asked to provide a score of their perception of the intensity of the saltiness of the solutions, using the scale: Intensity Scale: 0 = None 1 = Slight 2 = Moderate 3 = Strong In general the panel consisted of from 2 to 8 tasters. The average saltiness intensity score was plotted against time. Example 1: Sodium ascorbate/Ascorbic acid solutions In an initial set of solutions containing PEG3350 (40g), sodium chloride (2.8g), potassium chloride (1.3g) and sodium ascorbate (56.6g), it was found that the sweeteners sucralose and aspartame were most effective in reducing the perceived saltiness of the solution. Acesulfame-K and sodium saccharin were less effective. The solutions in Tables 1 and 2 were prepared and taste tested. The results of the taste testing are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Table 1 : Aspartame-containing solutions Table 2: Sucralose-containing solutions In Figures 1 and 2, it is seen that the saltiness intensity is reduced most in the solution containing sodium ascorbate and ascorbic acid in the ratio 85: 15, ie solutions F5 and G5. Example 2: Sodium ascorbate solutions and taste testing The solutions in Table 3 were prepared and taste tested. The results of the taste testing are shown in Figure 3. Table 3 : Sodium ascorbate solutions In Figure 3, it is seen that the saltiness intensity is reduced by decreasing the amount of sodium ascorbate in the solution (compare HI vs H2). It is further seen that the saltiness is reduced most by 1.25g/500ml of aspartame. Example 3: PEG-electrolyte solutions and taste testing In an initial set of solutions containing PEG3350 (100g), sodium sulphate (9.0g), sodium chloride (1.4g), potassium chloride (0.3g), it was found that the sweeteners sucralose (0.1%), aspartame (0.4%>) or a mixture of the two (sucralose 0.07%> / aspartame 0.12%) were most effective in reducing the perceived saltiness of the solution. Acesulfame-K, sodium saccharin and other mixtures were less effective. The solutions in Table 4 were prepared and taste tested. The results of the taste testing are shown in Figure 4. Table 4: PEG-electrolyte solutions The results of the taste testing are shown in Figure 4. It is seen that the solutions containing citric acid were perceived as less salty than the solutions without citric acid. Example 4: Bowel Cleansing Solutions The following bowel cleansing solutions of the invention were prepared. For solution S 1 , the components shown in Table 5 were combined in dry powder form and sealed in respective sachets A and B as indicated in the table. The solution was then prepared by dissolving the contents in water to the volume stated in the penultimate column. Solution S2 was prepared in an analogous manner. Table 5 For solution Tl, the components shown in Table 6 were combined in dry powder form and sealed in respective sachets C and D as indicated in the table. The solution was then prepared by mixing the contents of the two sachets together and then dissolving them in water to the volume stated in the penultimate column. Solution T2 was prepared in an analogous manner. Table 6 Example 4a - V(350) Osmolality measurements: In order to assess the osmotic strength of the solutions, it was determined how much water was required to provide a solution with measured osmolality of 350mOsmol/kg from the amounts of the components in Tables 5 and 6. To each solution prepared by dissolving the components in Tables 5 and 6 above in 500ml of deionised water was added further deionised water until it reached an osmolality of 350mOsmol/kg. The total volumes (including the initial 500ml) required to reach an osmolality of 350 mOsmol/kg are recorded in Tables 5 and 6 in the final columns. Osmolalities were measured using an Advanced Instruments, Inc Model 3250 osmometer. The osmometer was operated following standard instructions: after the device passes a calibration check, the "Low Range" osmolality range (0 to 2000 mOsmol/kg) is selected, and a sample tube containing 250μ1 of sample solution is placed in the freezing chamber. The "start" button is then pressed. When the measurement is completed, the device displays the measurement result and that is recorded. Example 4b - Bowel Cleansing In a bowel cleansing study, subjects are given solutions SI or S2 in an evening followed by Tl or T2 the following morning. In a variant, subjects are given solution Tl or T2 in an evening followed by SI or S2 the following morning. Each subject receives the solution regimen in the split dose intake: • Evening dose: Day 1 ; start intake between 17:00 and 18:00 for an intake period of up to 2 hours after fasting from 14:00 hours. • Morning dose: Day 2; start intake between 07:00 and 08:00 for an intake period of 2 hours. Following each dose additional clear liquid will be consumed to make the total dose and additional clear fluid ingested equal to at least 3L in the case of Arms 1 to 6, 8 and 9, and at least 2L in the case of Arm 7. Each dose of cleansing solution is reconstituted with water from the appropriate pair of sachets containing powder for oral solution. The cleansing solution can be cooled in the fridge based on subject preference. Evening cleansing solution dose is drunk within 2 hours after the start of the intake on the evening of Day 1. At least the indicated additional clear fluid is also consumed, preferably within 1 hour after the end of intake of cleansing solution in the evening. In the morning of Day 2, the second dose is drunk within 2 hours after the start of intake. At least the indicated additional clear fluid is also consumed, preferably within 1 hour after the end of intake of cleansing solution in the morning. The total duration of each intake of cleansing solution and clear fluid intake should normally not exceed 3 hours. Each subject is instructed to drink the assigned cleansing solutions as 100 niL fractions every 10 minutes. The mandatory additional clear liquid intake (water) after the cleansing solution intake can be taken by the subject as prefers, usually within 1 hour after completion of each cleansing solution intake. The start time and finish time of intake is recorded. The volume of any cleansing solution or additional clear fluid left in the respective containers is measured. In arms 6 to 9 the volume of fluid consumed ad libitum is monitored and recorded. Table 7: Table 8: Stool output is measured from the start of the intake on the evening of Day 1 and over the following 24 hours. "Stool" is the term used to refer to all bowel effluent. Mostly, it is liquid. The following are also assessed - Tolerability (vomiting rate). - Time and volume of cleansing solution to reach a clear effluent. In certain subjects, the following are also assessed: - Colon cleansing success. - The segmental cleansing scores for each of the five colon segments. - Pharmacokinetic evaluation of key active ingredients: Ascorbate components and their metabolite (oxalic acid) in blood, urine and faeces and PEG3350 and electrolytes in faeces at defined time points, to demonstrate biological activities. Electrolytes in blood and urine are quantified using standard clinical chemistry methods. The study described above was carried out in two parts: Parts A and B. Part A: In the part A, 120 subjects (70 male, 50 female) were allocated to the four study Arms, Arms 1 to 4. They were given the solutions as set out in Table 7. At the time of filing, the full statistical analysis of the results is not complete. The interim results based on a preliminary analysis of the data and available at the time of filing are shown in Table 9. Table 9: Overall, the compliance level was good. However, in each of Arms 2 and 4, 30 subjects began the study, but one subject left the study after consuming the first solution, and before any stool sample could be collected (thus 29 subjects are indicated (*)). The stool weight data are based on the set of 30 subjects for Arms 1 and 3, and on the set of 29 subjects for Arms 2 and 4. Both of those subjects who left the study had the symptom of vomiting. They are included in the vomiting rate results. It is seen that in each of Arms 1, 2 and 3 the subjects achieved a higher mean stool output weight than in Arm 4, which represents a prior art colon cleansing solution. This was achieved with the subjects in each of Arms 1, 2 and 3 consuming a lower total volume of bowel cleansing solution (investigational medicinal product "IMP") than in Arm 4. The vomiting rate for Arm 2 was higher than for the other arms. The vomiting rate for each of the solutions was within expected limits for a bowel cleansing solution. Part B: In part B, 120 subjects (54 male, 66 female) were allocated to the four study Arms, Arms 6 to 9. They were given the solutions as set out in Table 8. Mean stool output was highest in Arm 7 and slightly lower in Arm 6. Arm 8 gave a lower mean stool output, but all of Arms 6, 7 and 8 gave a higher mean stool output than Arm 9, which represents a prior art colon cleansing solution. Mean stool output exceeded 2400g in all arms. Mean stool output in Arms 6 and 7 exceeded 3000g. The subjects in part B underwent colonoscopy and the quality of cleansing was graded by the colonoscopist, who was not aware of which cleansing treatment had been administered. Grading used the Harefield Cleansing Scale. For details of the Harefield Cleansing Scale, see Halphen et al. , Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, 2013, 78, 121-131. The Harefield Cleansing Scale grades colon cleansing as Grade A, B, C or D, A being the best. Grades A and B are considered a successful cleansing; Grades C and D are considered an unsuccessful cleansing. At the time of filing, the full statistical analysis of the results is not complete. The interim results based on a preliminary analysis of the data and available at the time of filing are shown in Table 10. Table 10: It is seen in Table 10 that there was a higher proportion of Grade A cleansing in each of Arms 6, 7 and 8 than in Arm 9. This was achieved with the subjects in each of Arms 6, 7 and 8 consuming a lower total volume of bowel cleansing solution (investigational medicinal product "IMP") than in Arm 9. Example 5: Bowel Cleansing Solutions The following bowel cleansing solutions of the invention are prepared. For solution S3, the components shown in Table 11 are combined in dry powder form and sealed in respective sachets A and B as indicated in the table. The solution is then prepared by dissolving the contents in water to the volume stated in the far right-hand column. Solution S4 is prepared in an analogous manner Table 11 # citric acid encapsulated with water soluble coating For solution T3, the components shown in Table 12 are combined in dry powder form and sealed in respective sachets C and D as indicated in the table. The solution is then prepared by mixing the contents of the two sachets together and then dissolving them in water to the volume stated in the far right-hand column. Solutions T4, T5 and T6 are prepared in an analogous manner.
