Step C: 8-Chloro-7-iodo-2-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine
To a suspension of 1,2-diamino-3-chloro-4-iodopyridin-1-ium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate (2 g, 4.26 mmol) in MeOH (16.5 mL) at 0° C. was added Et3N (1.78 mL, 12.8 mmol), followed by trifluoroacetic anhydride (0.90 mL, 6.51 mmol) dropwise via syringe. The reaction mixture was maintained at 0° C. for 10 minutes, then allowed to warm to rt and stirred overnight. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo, and purified (FCC, SiO2, 0-100% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford the title compound as a white solid (1.26 g, 85% yield).
