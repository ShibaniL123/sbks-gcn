FIELD OF THE INVENTION [002] The present invention relates generally to compositions comprising plant material and methods for using the same.

The methods also include inhibiting the growth of a bacterium or fungus. Methods of using the composition for purifying a mixture comprising an alcohol, inhibiting agglomeration of a granulated product, inducing plant growth, and preventing erosion is also provided. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [003] World petroleum supplies are finite. Thus, as world petroleum demand has increased (84,337 Μ bpd worldwide in 2009; US Energy Information Administration), easily accessible reserves have been depleted. Furthermore, much of the world’s proven conventional petroleum reserves are located in regions which are politically unstable. Accordingly, supplies of petroleum from such regions might be uncertain since production of petroleum or the transportation of petroleum products from such regions might be interrupted. [004] Bituminous sands, colloquially known as oil sands or tar sands, are a type of unconventional petroleum deposit. The sands typically comprise naturally occurring mixtures of sand, clay, water, and a dense and viscous form of petroleum known as bitumen. Oil sands reserves have only recently been considered to be part of the world's oil reserves, as higher oil prices and new technology enable oil sands to be profitably extracted and refined. Thus, oil sands are now a viable alternative to conventional crude oil. Oil sands might represent as much as two-thirds of the world's total "liquid" hydrocarbon resources, with at least 1.7 trillion recoverable ΒΟΕ (barrel of oil equivalent) in the Canadian Athabasca oil sands alone. [005] Extra-heavy oil and bitumen flow very slowly, if at all, toward oil-producing wells under normal reservoir conditions. Accordingly, in certain oil recovery operations from oil sands, the oil is made to flow into wells by using in situ techniques that reduce its viscosity by injecting steam, solvents, or hot air into the sands. These processes typically use large amounts of water and require large amounts of energy relative to conventional oil extraction. Further, typical extraction processes applied to oil sands generate significantly higher amounts of greenhouse gases per barrel relative to the production of conventional oils due to the increased energy requirements for recovery of oil from oil sands. [006] In other oil sand mining operations, where oil sands are relatively close to the earth’s surface, surface mining has been used to extract the oil contained therein. After removing the overburden (the soil covering the oil sands), the sands are mechanically excavated and transported to a refining facility. [007] In one surface-mining method, after excavation, hot water and caustic soda (NaOH) are added to the sand. The resultant slurry is piped to the extraction plant where it is agitated and oil is skimmed off the mixture. The combination of hot water, sodium hydroxide, a flocculant and agitation generally releases bitumen from the oil sand, and the oil floats to the top of separation vessels where it is separated. Then, the separated oil is further treated to remove residual water and fine solids before subsequent processing to convert the heavy oil to usable products. [008] Such conventional processes to extract oil from oil sands also employ mixing the oil sand with high pH water, and then aerating the resultant mixture with air to produce froth (see, e.g., Masliyah, J.; Zhou, Ζ. J.; Xu, Ζ.; Czarnecki, J.; Hamza, Η.: “Understanding water-based bitumen extraction from Athabasca oil sands.” The Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering2004, 82, (4), 628-654). A slurry of high pH water and oil sand is placed in a primary separation cell (PSC). Agitation and introduction of air assists in separating oil from the oil sand, and creates a froth in which the oil is entrained. The froth is removed, deaerated, and sent to feed tanks for further treatment. The remaining sand, comprising residual oil not removed in the PSC, is treated as “middlings” or as bottoms using the same process for extracting oil from oil sands in the PSC (i.e., high pH water and aeration). The froth from these subsequent processes is recycled to the PSC. The overall enhancement of oil from the oil in the froth is approximately 60% by mass over the iterative removal steps. [009] About two tons of oil sands are required to produce one barrel (roughly 1/8 of a ton) of oil. After oil extraction, the spent sand and other materials are typically transported back to the mine for disposal. However, even with improved extraction processes, up to 10% of the oil in the oil sands can be left in the resultant tailings. Thus, the process is inefficient. The tailings can contain significant amounts of oil and other pollutants which must be disposed of in an environmentally sound manner. In conventional oil sand mining operations, this has resulted in large lagoons containing high levels of oil and other pollutants. Accordingly, there is a need for improved compositions and methods for extraction of oil from oil sands that are more efficient (e.g., can remove higher amounts of oil), use less energy, and produce tailings that are environmentally benign. [0010] In addition, in conventional oil production processes, methods of enhancing oil recovery are known. These include, but are not limited to hydraulic fracturing of rock formations containing hydrocarbon deposits. In hydraulic fracturing operations, a fluid (e.g., water) which can comprise various additives (e.g., acids, rheology modifiers, detergents, gels, gas, proppant, etc.) is introduced into a rock formation under high pressure to fracture the rock formation. Such fracturing of a hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation effectively increases the surface area of rock exposed to a wellbore (i.e., along the fracture faces), and accordingly, allows more hydrocarbon to flow into the well bore. However, the viscosity of the oils contained in the formation can limit the utility of hydraulically fracturing rock formations which contain heavy oils. That is, if the viscosity of the oil is too high, increasing the surface area of the formation exposed to the well bore along the fracture might not significantly increase production rates. Accordingly, there is a need for hydraulic fracturing fluids which can enhance total oil recovery or increase oil production rates. [0011] In addition, remediation of environmentally compromised sites (e.g., hazardous waste sites) is an ongoing challenge. For example, there are many sites where hydrocarbons (e.g., crude oil, coal tar, creosote, refined oil products) have been spilled or discharged into the environment. Such discharges can result in contamination of soil or water, and can contaminate groundwater supplies. Accordingly, such contaminated sites or waters (e.g., rivers, streams, ponds and harbors) require remediation to extract contaminants. [0012] There are several known remediation technologies. One method comprises excavation of contaminated soil. However, remediation by excavation has traditionally been a “dig and haul” process, wherein contaminated soils are excavated and disposed of in landfills or destroyed by thermal treatments such as incineration. In the case of landfill disposal of contaminated soil, the problem of soil contamination is not resolved as the soil is relocated and moved to another location. In the case of thermal desorption, the hydrocarbon or other pollutants can be destroyed, but typically produces a large carbon footprint, which, in and of itself, is not an environmentally friendly process, since energy is required and greenhouse gases are produced. [0013] Chemical treatment (e.g., oxidation) has also been utilized in the remediation of contaminated soil. This process comprises excavation of the contaminated soil, followed by chemical treatment to chemically modify or degrade the pollutants to potentially less toxic or hazardous forms. However, such methods can require large quantities of specialized chemicals to oxidize the contaminants, and can be ineffective at oxidizing certain pollutants. [0014] Another remediation method comprises injection of a material into the soil to sequester contaminants, with a goal of immobilizing them and preventing them from migrating. For example, stabilization/solidification (S/S) is a remediation or treatment technology that relies on the reaction between a binder and soil to stop, prevent or reduce the mobility of contaminants. Stabilization comprises the addition of liquid or solid materials to contaminated soil to produce more chemically stable constituents. Solidification comprises the addition of liquid or solid reagents to a contaminated material to impart physical, for example, dimensional stability, so that they are constrained in a solid product and to reduce mobility of the contaminants. However, such methods might not be desirable since over time, the solids can break down or degrade, releasing the hydrocarbons or other pollutants back into the environment. [0015] Accordingly, there is a need for cost-effective methods for extracting contaminants (e.g., hydrocarbons) from soils and other substrates at environmentally compromised or contaminated sites and for sequestering contaminants in situ in a cost effective manner. [0016] There is also a need for improved compositions and methods for extracting or removing other undesirable substances from substrates, such as the removal of a protein, lipid, wax, fatty acid or fatty alcohol from a substrate such as fabric, skin or hair. For example, skin sebum contains bulky oils such as long chain fatty esters and triglycerides and can be difficult to remove. Sebum generally comprises a complex mixture of triglycerides, wax esters, squalene, sterol esters and free sterols produced by sebocytes (cells of the sebaceous glands in the skin) and secreted to the skin surface. An excessive amount of sebum on the skin can lead to undesirable skin effects. Similarly, an excessive amount of oils or grease in hair can lead to an undesirable appearance. Thus, there is a need for novel compositions and methods to remove excessive oils from the skin and hair. [0017] There is also a need for improved compositions and methods that are useful for extracting or removing from substrates such as metal, ceramic and plastic, other undesirable substances, such as fats, oil and grease, derived from plants or animals. For example, triglycerides present in grease, e.g., from cooking or in wastewater , can be difficult to remove from a substrate, and may coalesce, blocking pipes. Thus, there is a need for novel compositions and methods that are useful for removing from substrates such as metal, ceramic and plastic, fats, oil and grease derived from plants or animals. [0018] There is also a need for improved compositions that are useful for inhibiting the growth of a bacterium, fungus (e.g., mold) or a virus from a substrate such as metal, ceramic, plastic, and cement. For example, contact with a substrate having bacteria or a virus thereon can result in illness. In addition, fungi growing on a substrate can be difficult to remove, and can also result in illness when contacted. Thus, there is a need for novel compositions and methods for inhibiting the growth of a bacterium or fungus. [0019] The present invention meets these needs and provides related advantages.

[00165] The plant material mixture can then be admixed with one or more additives described herein. The plant material mixture can be added to the one or more additives, or vice versa. Typically the plant material mixture and one or more additives are admixed with agitation (e.g., stirring, mixing).

In certain embodiments, the resultant mixture is agitated at ambient temperature (e.g., about 23 °C). [00166] The resultant mixture is then allowed to stand without agitation to allow any undissolved or unsuspended solids to precipitate. The resultant mixture can be allowed to stand at a temperature of from about 5 °C to about 100 °C (e.g., about 5 °C to about 10 °C, about 10 °C to about 15 °C, about 15 °C to about 20 °C, about 20 °C to about 25 °C, about 25 °C to about 30 °C, about 30 °C to about 35 °C, about 35 °C to about 40 °C, about 40 °C to about 45 °C, about 45 °C to about 50 °C, about 50 °C to about 55 °C, about 55 °C to about 60 °C, about 60 °C to about 65 °C, about 65 °C to about 70 °C, about 70 °C to about 75 °C, about 75 °C to about 80 °C, about 80 °C to about 85 °C, about 85 °C to about 90 °C, about 90 °C to about 95 °C, about 95 °C to about 100 °C, or any other value or range of values therein) for a period of about 10 minutes, about 20 minutes, about 30 minutes, about 40 minutes, about 50 minutes, about 1 hour, about 2 hours, about 3 hours, about 4 hours, about 8 hours, or any other value or range of values therein or thereabove). In certain embodiments, after admixture with an additive, the resultant mixture is allowed to stand at ambient temperature (e.g., about 23 °C), until any undissolved or unsuspended solids present have precipitated. The resultant mixture can then be decanted or filtered to remove the solids therefrom, and the solids are discarded, to provide the present aqueous composition in the form of a solvent mixture. The solvent mixture generally has a final pH ranging from about 5 to about 14 (e.g., from about 5 to about 6, from about 6 to about 7, from about 7 to about 8, from about 8 to about 9, from about 9 to about 10, from about 10 to about 11, from about 11 to about 12, from about 12 to about 13, from about 13 to about 14, or any other value or range of values therein).

[00167] In certain embodiments, the resultant mixture can be further purified via the application of gravity or another force that can effect separation of one or more unwanted by-products (e.g., solids, gels, suspensions and the like) from the present aqueous compositions. For example, in some embodiments, the resultant mixture is subject to centrifugal force effected by a centrifuge to remove one or more unwanted by-products.

Pharmaceutical Compositions [00241] In another aspect of the present invention, a Composition of the Invention is useful as a pharmaceutical composition and optionally comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, vehicle or excipient. [00242] The pharmaceutically acceptable excipient can provide the form for proper administration to the subject. Such pharmaceutically acceptable excipients can be liquids, such as water and oil, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable excipients can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening, lubricating, and coloring agents can be used. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are sterile when administered to a subject. Water is a useful excipient when a Composition of the Invention is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid excipients, specifically for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients also include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The present pharmaceutical compositions, if desired, can also comprise minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or pH buffering agents. [00243] The present pharmaceutical compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, pellets, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition is in the form of a capsule (see e.g. U.S. Patent No. 5,698,155). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical excipients are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences 1447-1676 (Alfonso R. Gennaro eds., 19th ed. 1995), incorporated herein by reference. [00244] In one embodiment, a pharmaceutical Composition of the Invention is formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a composition adapted for oral administration to human beings. Compositions for oral delivery can be in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups, or elixirs for example. Orally administered compositions can comprise one or more agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or saccharin; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen, or cherry; coloring agents; and preserving agents, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions can be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended period of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving a pharmaceutical Composition of the Invention are also suitable for orally administered compositions. In these latter platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A timedelay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate can also be useful. Oral compositions can include standard excipients such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, cellulose, and magnesium carbonate. In one embodiment, the excipients are of pharmaceutical grade. [00245] In another embodiment, the pharmaceutical Compositions of the Invention can be formulated for intravenous administration. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration comprise sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions can also include a solubilizing agent. Compositions for intravenous administration can optionally include a local anesthetic such as lignocaine to lessen pain at the site of the injection. [00246] Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized-powder or water- free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where a pharmaceutical Composition of the Invention is to be administered by infusion, it can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the pharmaceutical Composition of the Invention is administered by injection, an ampule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed prior to administration. [00247] Pharmaceutical Compositions of the Invention can be administered by controlledrelease or sustained-release means or by delivery devices that are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Patent by reference in its entirety. Such dosage forms can be useful for providing controlled- or sustained-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled- or sustained-release formulations known to those skilled in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with a Composition of the Invention. The present invention thus provides single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled- or sustained-release. [00248] Controlled- or sustained-release of an active ingredient can be induced by various conditions, including but not limited to, changes in pH, changes in temperature, concentration or availability of enzymes, concentration or availability of water, or other physiological conditions or compounds. The amount of the Composition of the Invention that is effective in the treatment or prevention of a disease can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed can also depend on the route of administration, and the seriousness of the condition being treated and can be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each subject's circumstances in view of, e.g., published clinical studies.

[00283] The present methods of extracting a hydrocarbon-containing substance can be performed at less-than elevated temperature (e.g., at about 23 °C). However, in certain embodiments, it can be advantageous to heat a mixture of a Composition of the Invention and a substrate to improve or accelerate extraction or remediation. Thus, the present methods can be performed at a temperature of from about 5 °C to about 100 °C (e.g., about 5 °C to about 10 °C, about 10 °C to about 15 °C, about 15 °C to about 20 °C, about 20 °C to about 25 °C, about 25 °C to about 30 °C, about 30 °C to about 35 °C, about 35 °C to about 40 °C, about 40 °C to about 45 °C, about 45 °C to about 50 °C, about 50 °C to about 55 °C, about 55 °C to about 60 °C, about 60 °C to about 65 °C, about 65 °C to about 70 °C, about 70 °C to about 75 °C, about 75 °C to about 80 °C, about 80 °C to about 85 °C, about 85 °C to about 90 °C, about 90 °C to about 95 °C, about 95 °C to about 100 °C, or any other value or range of values therein).

Thus, in certain embodiments, the animal is a living animal. In other embodiments, the animal is a dead animal, which might be cleaned or decontaminated. [00285] According to the present invention, extracting a hydrocarbon-containing substance comprises contacting the substrate with a Composition of the Invention under conditions that are effective for extracting at least some of the hydrocarbon-containing substance from the substrate. A hydrocarbon-containing substance comprises one or more hydrocarbons. In some embodiments, the hydrocarbon is aromatic, such as benzene, toluene, naphthalene, xylene and a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH).

In some embodiments, the hydrocarbon comprises an ester, an amide, an amine, an imine, a carboxylic acid, a sulfide, a sulfoxide, a sulfone, a nitroxide or a nitrone moiety. In other embodiments, the hydrocarbon comprises a halogen. In some embodiments, the hydrocarbon-containing substance is an oil. Such oils include light oils having an API (American Petroleum Institute) gravity higher than 31.1 °API (i.e., a density of less than 870 kg/m3), medium oils having an API gravity between 22.3 °API and 31.1 °API (i.e., a density of from 870 kg/m3 to 920 kg/m3), heavy oils having an API gravity below 22.3 °API to 10.0 °API (i.e., a density of from 920 kg/m3 to 1000 kg/m3), or extra heavy oil having an API gravity below 10.0 °API (i.e., a density of greater than 1000 kg/m3). Thus, light, medium and heavy oils are less dense than water, whereas extra heavy oil is more dense than water. In some embodiments, the oil is a light tar oil. A light tar oil is an oil having an API gravity of 22.3 °API to 10.0 °API. [00287] In other embodiments, the hydrocarbon-containing substance is coal tar. “Coal tar” as used herein refers to a dense non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) which comprises mixture of highly aromatic hydrocarbons, where the mixture optionally comprises aliphatic hydrocarbons. Coal tar is typically a brown or black liquid having a very high viscosity, and is generally not pourable from a vessel at ambient temperatures. Coal tar is one by-product of the manufacture of coke from coal, or from gasification of coal. Coal tar can be complex or variable mixtures and can comprise one of more phenols, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and heterocyclic compounds. “Coal tar sand” as used herein is a mixture of sand and coal tar, e.g., sand coated with coal tar, or coal tar with sand mixed or embedded therein. [00288] In other embodiments, the hydrocarbon-containing substance is sludge, e.g., from a storage tank employed for storing industrial sewage or other waste materials. Such sludge can comprise any hydrocarbon-containing substance as described herein, including light oils, medium oils, heavy oils, extra-heavy oils, bitumen, or coal tar as described herein, in addition to sediment such as sand, silt or clay, metals or waxes. An oil-contaminated sludge is a sludge as which comprises an oil. [00289] In certain embodiments, the oil is crude oil. In some embodiments, the crude oil is a sweet crude oil (oil having relatively low sulfur content, e.g., less than about 0.42% sulfur). In other embodiments, the crude oil is a sour crude oil (oil having relatively high sulfur content e.g., about 0.42% or more sulfur).

In other embodiments, the hydrocarbon-containing substance is heating oil. In other embodiments, the hydrocarbon-containing substance is jet fuel. In other embodiments, the hydrocarbon-containing substance is aviation gasoline. In other embodiments, the hydrocarbon-containing substance is kerosene. [00290] In some embodiments, the methods for extracting a hydrocarbon-containing substance from a substrate further comprise recovering the hydrocarbon-containing substance and optionally purifying it. For example, where the hydrocarbon-containing substance is crude oil, the extracted crude oil can be recovered and optionally refined to provide one or more conventional oil-derived products. [00291] In some embodiments, the hydrocarbon-containing substance is removed from the substrate’s surface. In other embodiments, hydrocarbon-containing substance is extracted from the substrate. In some embodiments the present methods for extracting the hydrocarbon-containing substance result in the formation of a biphasic or multiphasic mixture in which one of the phases is agglomerated hydrocarbon-containing substance (e.g., in the form of an “oil ball”), which can be easily removed from the aqueous composition or extractant by, for example, skimming, decantation, centrifugation or filtration. In certain embodiments, the hydrocarbon-containing substance extracted or removed from the substrate forms one or more agglomerations that can be spherical or spheroid in shape. In some embodiments, the agglomerations of hydrocarbon-containing material may range in diameter from about 0.1 mm to about 1 cm. The size of the present agglomerations can depend on the amount of hydrocarbon-containing substance present. Thus, where a large amount of hydrocarbon-containing substance is present, the agglomerations may be relatively larger in diameter, ranging from about 1 mm to about 10 cm or larger. In other embodiments, the hydrocarbon-containing substance does not agglomerate, but forms a layer on the top of the present aqueous compositions or extractants. [00292] In still other embodiments, the hydrocarbon-containing substance can form “stringers,” e.g., thread-like or filamentous masses of the hydrocarbon substance that can be extracted or removed from a substrate. For example, such stringers can have a width or diameter of from about 0.1 mm to about 1 cm or larger. The size of the present stringers can depend on the amount of hydrocarbon-containing substance present. Thus, where a large amount of hydrocarbon-containing substance is present, the stringers may be relatively larger in width or diameter, ranging from about 1 mm to about 10 cm or larger. Similarly, the stringers may have a length ranging from, e.g., about 5 mm to about 5 cm when employed in bench-scale experiments. As described with respect to width or diameter of the present stringers, that the length of the present stringers can depend on the amount of hydrocarbon-containing substance present. [00293] In certain embodiments, the present methods further comprise subjecting the aqueous composition, extractant or substrate comprising a hydrocarbon-containing substance to agitation. Thus, a substrate can be contacted with the aqueous composition or extractant, and subjected to mixing, stirring, fluid circulation, or any technique known in the art for agitating a mixture. [00294] In some embodiments, the present methods can further comprise aerating the present aqueous compositions or extractants when admixed or combined with a substrate comprising a hydrocarbon-containing substance. Aeration can be effected by introducing a gas into a mixture comprising one or more of the present aqueous compositions or extractants and a substrate containing a hydrocarbon-containing substance. In some embodiments the gas is air. In other embodiments, the gas is an inert gas such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen or argon. Aeration can be conducted before stirring or agitation of the mixture, concurrent with stirring or agitation, after stirring or agitation, or any combination of before, during and after stirring or agitation. Such aeration of the present aqueous compositions or extractants can be effected by employing a suitable device for introducing a gas into a fluid, e.g., a fritted glass bubble, a gas manifold, solid or pliable tubes, etc. Gas may be introduced into the mixture at a rate ranging from 0.01 L/min to about 10 L/min per liter of aqueous composition or extractant (e.g., from about 0.01 L/min to about 0.1 L/min, from about 0. 1 L/min to about 0.2 L/min, from about 0.2 L/min to about 0.3 L/min, from about 0.3 L/min to about 0.4 L/min, from about 0.4 L/min to about 0.5 L/min, from about 0.5 L/min to about 0.6 L/min, from about 0.6 L/min to about 0.7 L/min, from about 0.7 L/min to about 0.8 L/min, from about 0.8 L/min to about 0.9 L/min, from about 0.9 L/min to about 1 L/min, from about 1 L/min to about 2 L/min, from about 2 L/min to about 3 L/min, from about 3 L/min to about 4 L/min, from about 4 L/min to about 5 L/min, from about 5 L/min to about 6 L/min, from about 6 L/min to about 7 L/min, from about 7 L/min to about 8 L/min, from about 8 L/min to about 9 L/min, from about 9 L/min to about 10 L/min, or any other value or range of values therein). The amount of gas introduced per liter of aqueous composition or extractant can depend on the total amount of solution present and the size of the container in which the aqueous composition or extractant is combined with the substrate containing the hydrocarbon-containing substance to be extracted. Extracted hydrocarbon-containing material in the produced froth may be separated from the froth by skimming or centrifugation. In such processes, hydrocarbon-containing material may be recovered from an extractant or aqueous composition after an extraction and frothing process, and then the extractant or aqueous composition can be recycled for reuse in an extraction process. [00295] Aeration of the present aqueous compositions or extractants can create foam from the aqueous compositions or extractants. Such foams can have sufficient mechanical strength and/or stability to entrain or carry hydrocarbon-containing substance which has been removed or extracted from a substrate. Thus, aeration may provide a foam which entrains and transports an extracted hydrocarbon-containing substance out of the vessel in which such a substrate was combined with the present aqueous compositions or extractants. [00296] In some embodiments, the present methods for extracting a hydrocarbon-containing substance from a substrate comprise hydraulically fracturing the substrate with a fracturing fluid that comprises a present aqueous composition or extractant. The method can comprise injecting a fracturing fluid comprising a present composition or extractant into a substrate (e.g., a rock formation) at a pressure effective to fracture the substrate. Surface pumping pressures can range from about 500 psi (pounds-per-square-inch, lb/in2) to about 15.000 psi (e.g., about 500 psi, about 1,000 psi, about 1,500 psi, about 2,000 psi, about 2,500 psi, about 3,000 psi, about 3,500 psi, about 4,000 psi, about 4,500 psi, about 5,000 psi, about 5,500 psi, about 6,000 psi, about 6,500 psi, about 7,000 psi, about 7,500 psi, about 8,000 psi, about 8,500 psi, about 9,000 psi, about 9,500 psi, about 10,000 psi, about 10,500 psi, about 11,000 psi, about 11,500 psi, about 12,000 psi, about 12,500 psi, about 13,000 psi, about 13,500 psi, about 14.000 psi, about 14,500 psi, about 15,000 psi). The surface pumping pressure can vary depending on fluid injection rates, well depth and orientation (e.g., vertical, horizontal, inclined, etc.), formation type (e.g., sandstone, limestone, etc.), perforation size and number of perforations in the production casing across the production zone being fractured, etc. Furthermore, fluid pumping pressures typically vary over the course of the fracturing operation, and can increase, decrease, or both during the course of a fracturing operation. [00297] The fracturing fluid can further comprise one or more additives such as a proppant, viscosity modifier, radioactive tracer, gel, alcohol, detergent, acid, fluid-loss additive, gas (e.g., nitrogen or carbon dioxide) dispersant or flocculant. The fracturing fluid can then be recovered or produced from the substrate (e.g., via a wellbore), extracting the hydrocarbon-containing substance from the substrate as the fracturing fluid is recovered or produced. The resultant mixture of the fracturing fluid and extracted hydrocarbon-containing substance can be further processed to separate the hydrocarbon-containing substance from the fracturing fluid. [00298] Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the present invention provides a hydraulic fracturing fluid comprising an aqueous composition of the present invention. In certain embodiments, the hydraulic fracturing fluid further comprises an additive. In some embodiments, the additive is one or more of a proppant, a viscosity modifier, a radioactive tracer, a gel, an alcohol, a detergent, an acid, a fluid loss additive, a gas, a dispersant or a flocculant. In other embodiments, the present invention provides a hydraulic fracturing fluid comprising an extractant of the present invention. In certain embodiments, the hydraulic fracturing fluid further comprises an additive. In certain embodiments, the additive is one or more of a proppant, a viscosity modifier, a radioactive tracer, a gel, an alcohol, a detergent, an acid, a fluid loss additive, a gas, a dispersant or a flocculant. In certain embodiments, the invention further provides a method for extracting a hydrocarbon-containing substance from a substrate, comprising hydraulically fracturing the substrate with a hydraulic fracturing fluid comprising an aqueous composition of the present invention. In other embodiments, the present invention provides a method for extracting a hydrocarbon-containing substance from a substrate, comprising hydraulically fracturing the substrate with a hydraulic fracturing fluid comprising an extractant of the present invention. [00299] The extraction efficiency, i.e., amount of hydrocarbon-containing substance that can be extracted from a substrate, ranges from about 5 wt% of the substrate’s hydrocarbon-containing substance to 100 wt% of the substrate’s hydrocarbon-containing substance; in one embodiment from about 10 wt% of the substrate’s hydrocarbon-containing substance to about 90 wt% of the substrate’s hydrocarbon-containing substance; in other embodiments, at least about 5 wt%, at least about 10 wt%, at least about 15 wt%, at least about 20 wt%, at least about 25 wt%, at least about 30 wt%, at least about 35 wt%, at least about 40 wt%, at least about 45 wt%, at least about 50 wt%, at least about 55 wt%, at least about 60 wt%, at least about 65 wt%, at least about 70 wt%, at least about 75 wt%, at least about 80 wt%, at least about 85 wt%, at least about 90 wt%, at least about 95 wt%, at least about 96 wt%, at least about 97 wt%, at least about 98 wt%, at least about 99 wt%, about 99.5 wt%, or greater than about 99.5 wt%, (or any other value or range of values therein or thereabove) of the total amount of hydrocarbon-containing substance present in or on the substrate. [00300] In some embodiments, the present methods may be performed at ambient pressure. In other embodiments, the present methods may be conducted at a reduced pressure from about 100 mm Hg to about 760 mm Hg (e.g., from about 100 mm Hg to about 200 mm Hg, from about 200 mm Hg to about 300 mm Hg, from about 300 mm Hg to about 400 mm Hg, from about 400 mm Hg to about 500 mm Hg, from about 500 mm Hg to about 600 mm Hg, from about 600 mm Hg to about 700 mm Hg, from about 700 mm Hg to about 760 mm Hg, or any other value or range of values therein). In other embodiments, the present methods may be performed at an elevated pressure from about 760 mm Hg to about 7600 mm Hg (e.g., from about 760 mm Hg to about 1520 mm Hg, from about 1520 mm Hg to about 2280 mm Hg, from about 2280 mm Hg to about 3040 mm Hg, from about 3040 mm Hg to about 3800 mm Hg, from about 3800 mm Hg to about 4560 mm Hg, from about 4560 mm Hg to about 5320 mm Hg, from about 5320 mm Hg to about 6080 mm Hg, from about 6080 mm Hg to about 6840 mm Hg, from about 6840 mm Hg to about 7600 mm Hg, or any other value or range of values therein). [00301] The present invention further provides methods for remediating a substrate by removing a hydrocarbon-containing substance comprising contacting the substrate with a Composition of the Invention of the invention under conditions effective for remediating the substrate. Remediating can include purifying water by removing a hydrocarbon-containing substance such that it becomes potable, suitable for swimming or non-toxic to aquatic species; converting soil contaminated with a hydrocarbon-containing substance to that which is useful as farm and or for real estate; converting hydrocarbon-containing oil sand to sand that is suitable for commercial or recreational use, etc. Thus, remediating a substrate can substantially improve the quality of a substrate, for example, rendering it non-toxic. In some embodiments, remediating the substrate includes removing a hydrocarbon-containing substance from the surface of a substrate, or extracting the hydrocarbon-containing substance from pores, fractures, cracks, fissures or crevices in a substrate. The present methods are useful for remediating environmentally contaminated sites, soils or animals. [00302] Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the present invention provides methods for remediating a substrate, comprising contacting the substrate with an aqueous composition of the present invention under conditions effective for remediating the substrate. In some embodiments, the substrate is plastic, rock, mineral, bone, teeth, soil, sand, wood, paper, skin, a water body, gravel, mud, clay, plant, hair, fabric, glass, porcelain, concrete, metal or an animal. In certain embodiments, the substrate is a water body. In other embodiments, the substrate is soil. In some embodiments, the substrate is an animal. In some embodiments, the animal is a living animal. In other embodiments, the animal is a dead animal. In certain embodiments, remediating comprises extracting a hydrocarbon-containing substance from the substrate. In other embodiments, the contacting occurs at an aqueous composition or a substrate temperature of about 5°C to about 90°C (e.g., about 5 °C, about 10 °C, about 15 °C, about 20 °C, about 25 °C, about 30 °C, about 35 °C, about 40 °C, about 45 °C, about 50 °C, about 55 °C, about 60 °C, about 65 °C, about 70 °C, about 75 °C, about 80 °C, about 85 °C, about 90 °C, or any other value or range of values therein).

In some embodiments, the method further comprises subjecting the aqueous composition or substrate to agitation. In some embodiments, the agitation is mixing. In some embodiments, the hydrocarbon-containing substance is petrolatum, grease, oil, coal tar, bitumen, coal tar sand, sludge, oil-contaminated sludge, light tar oil or creosote.

In other embodiments, the hydrocarbon-containing substance is aviation gasoline. In other embodiments, the hydrocarbon-containing substance is kerosene. [00303] In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for remediating a substrate, comprising contacting the substrate with an extractant of the present invention under conditions effective for remediating the substrate. In certain embodiments, the substrate is soil, sand, wood, paper, skin, a water body, gravel, mud, clay, plant, hair, fabric, metal or an animal. In other embodiments, the substrate is a water body. In some embodiments, the substrate is soil. In other embodiments, the substrate is an animal. In some embodiments, the animal is a living animal. In other embodiments, the animal is a dead animal. In some embodiments, remediating comprises extracting a hydrocarbon-containing substance from the substrate. In certain embodiments, contacting occurs at an extractant or substrate temperature of about 5° to about 90°C (e.g., about 5 °C, about 10 °C, about 15 °C, about 20 °C, about 25 °C, about 30 °C, about 35 °C, about 40 °C, about 45 °C, about 50 °C, about 55 °C, about 60 °C, about 65 °C, about 70 °C, about 75 °C, about 80 °C, about 85 °C, about 90 °C, or any other value or range of values therein).

In certain embodiments, agitation comprises sonication. In other embodiments, agitation is effected by microwave.

In other embodiments, the hydrocarbon-containing substance is aviation gasoline. In other embodiments, the hydrocarbon-containing substance is kerosene. [00304] In another aspect, the present methods result in the sequestration of hydrocarbon-containing substance present in or on the substrate. Such methods can comprise introducing a present aqueous composition or extractant into the soil, e.g., the soil’s subsurface, via, e.g., groundwater monitoring or one or more remediation wells. Without being bound by any particular theory of the mechanism of such sequestration, introducing a present aqueous composition or extractant into the soil can effectively encapsulate or agglomerate hydrocarbon-containing substance therein, rendering it relatively immobile. Accordingly, such methods can also render the hydrocarbon-containing substance effectively inert via sequestration. [00305] The present methods can be performed by allowing a substrate and one or more of the present aqueous compositions or extractants to contact within a container, such as a tank, vessel, pool or pit. The contacting can be performed at atmospheric pressure or above in a batch, semi-batch or continuous mode, for example, where hydrocarbon-containing substance is continuously removed from the substrate. In some embodiments, the present aqueous compositions or extractants are reused after removing hydrocarbon-containing substance from a substrate or after remediating a substrate. In other embodiments, “fresh,” previously unused aqueous composition or extractant is continuously contacted with the substrate. [00306] Contacting is conducted under conditions that are effective for extracting at least some hydrocarbon-containing substance from the substrate or for remediating the substrate. Thus, in certain embodiments, the contacting time is about 10 minutes, about 20 minutes, about 30 minutes, about 40 minutes, about 50 minutes, about 60 minutes, about 2 hours, about 3 hours, about 4 hours, about 5 hours, about 6 hours, about 12 hours, about 18 hours, about 24 hours, about two or three days, about a week, about a month or about several months (or any other value or range of values therein or thereabove). In addition, contacting can be conducted at a temperature of from about 5 °C to about 90 °C (e.g., about 5 °C, about 10 °C, about 15 °C, about 20 °C, about 25 °C, about 30 °C, about 35 °C, about 40 °C, about 45 °C, about 50 °C, about 55 °C, about 60 °C, about 65 °C, about 70 °C, about 75 °C, about 80 °C, about 85 °C, about 90 °C, or any other value or range of values therein). In one embodiment, the contacting occurs at an aqueous composition or a substrate temperature of about 4°C to about 38°C. In one embodiment, the contacting is conducted at a temperature of from about 5 °C to about 50 °C; in other embodiments from about 20 °C to about 30 °C. In other embodiments the contacting occurs at about 20 °C, at about 30 °C, at about 40 °C, at about 50 °C, at about 60 °C, at about 70 °C, at about 80 °C, at about 90 °C, or any other value or range of values therein or thereabove). [00307] In certain embodiments, it can be advantageous to adjust the pH of the substrate or the aqueous compositions or extractants, for example, to effect a desired separation or to promote formation of aggregates of hydrocarbon-containing substance. Thus, in certain embodiments, the pH of the substrate or the present aqueous compositions or extractants can be adjusted to about 13, about 12, about 11, about 10, about 9, about 8, about 7, about 6, about 5, about 4, about 3 (or any other value or range of values therein or therebelow). Such pH adjustment can be performed by adding an acid or base as previously described herein. The acid or base can be added continuously, or in aliquots. The acid or base can be added undiluted or as a mixture in water or organic solvent. [00308] Industrial extraction of oil from the Athabasca oil sands produces wastewater comprising fines, or small particulates, in the oil extraction process. These fines can remain suspended in waste water and prevent recycling of water in an extraction process, or alternatively, prevent discharge of fines-laden wastewater into the environment. Accordingly, a method to promote rapid settling of fines, thereby allowing discharge of the wastewater from an extraction process, is desirable. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for precipitating fines contained in a vessel further containing a hydrocarbon-containing material and a aqueous composition or an extractant as described herein, comprising acidifying the contents of said vessel to a pH of about 4.6 or less. [00309] Any Composition of the Invention as described herein may be employed in an extraction process which produces fines-laden water. The resultant fines-laden water, which can further comprise hydrocarbon-containing material, can then be acidified to reduce the pH of the fines-laden water to less than about 4.6, and precipitate the fines suspended therein. Acids which may be suitable for reducing the pH of the fines-laden water may include organic or inorganic acids. For example, the inorganic acids may include hydrofluoric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfurous acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid and carbonic acid. Organic acids can alternatively be employed. Suitable organic acids include Ci to C20 organic acids such as formic acid, citric acid, malic acid, adipic acid, tannic acid, lactic acid, ascorbic acid, acetic acid, fumaric acid, and mixtures thereof. [00310] The acid can be added in concentrated form, or as an aqueous solution. The acid is generally added to the solution in which the fines are present, and can be added with concomitant agitation. Alternatively, the solution may be agitated after addition of the acid. Such agitation may include mechanical agitation, or hydraulic mixing provided by pumping and circulation of the fines-laden fluid in the vessel in which it is contained. [00311] The vessel may be a metal or polymer tank, or may be an earthen pit or excavated reservoir, which may be lined to prevent fluid communication of the wastewater with groundwater and/or subterranean water-nearing formations. After addition of the acid, and mixing to disperse the acid in solution, the solution is typically allowed to stand for a period of time to allow the fines to settle, and for any hydrocarbon-containing material released from the fines or present in the solution to float to the surface. Settling times may range from about 1 minute to about 1 week (e.g., from about 1 minute to about 2 minutes, from about 2 minutes to about 5 minutes, from about 5 minutes to about 10 minutes, from about 10 minutes to about 20 minutes, from about 20 minutes to about 30 minutes, from about 30 minutes to about 40 minutes, from about 40 minutes to about 50 minutes, from about 50 minutes to about 1 hour, from about 1 hour to about 2 hours, from about 2 hours to about 3 hours, from about 3 hours to about 4 hours, from about 4 hours to about 5 hours, from about 5 hours to about 6 hours, from about 6 hours to about 7 hours, from about 7 hours to about 8 hours, from about 8 hours to about 9 hours, from about 9 hours to about 10 hours, from about 10 hours to about 11 hours, from about 12 hours to about 12 hours, from about 12 hours to about 1 day, from about 1 day to about 2 days, from about 2 days to about 3 days, from about 3 days to about 4 days, from about 4 days to about 5 days, from about 5 days to about 6 days, from about 6 days to about 1 week, or any other value or range of values therein). Residual hydrocarbon-containing material released during or after acidification and/or settling can be recovered by, e.g., skimming. In other embodiments, remaining hydrocarbon-containing material may be separated by centrifugation. In such processes, hydrocarbon-containing material may be recovered from an extractant or aqueous composition after an extraction process; fines can be removed by lowering the pH; and then remaining hydrocarbon-containing material can be removed by centrifugation. The remaining extractant or aqueous composition can then be recycled for reuse in an extraction process. [00312] In other embodiments, the aqueous compositions or extractants further comprise a substrate, which can be present in the aqueous composition or extractant in a weight ratio of substrate:aqueous composition or extractant from about 0.01:1 to about 1:1, in one embodiment, from about 0.1:1 to about 1:1. However, the substrate:aqueous composition or extractant ratio is not limited, and can be selected according to a particular application and to minimize the amount of the aqueous composition or extractant employed.

[00405] Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their alkylated analogs are ubiquitous environmental pollutants. They are in fossil fuels, and their by-products can enter the environment from natural seeps or runoff from asphalt. Incomplete combustion of organic materials can result in transporting these compounds over long distances as gaseous molecules or organically-bound particulate matter. In addition, there are tens of thousands of coal-tar contaminated gas plants worldwide that are and will continue to contribute to PAH pollution. [00406] Some PAHs are toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic, and therefore pose risk to human health and the environment. Alkylated PAHs have been shown to contribute substantially to the toxicity of PAH mixtures, in some cases accounting for 80% of the toxic burden. Similarly, PASH bioaccumulates and can be toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic. [00407] The US ΕΡΑ provides guidelines for estimating the hazards posed by contaminated soils and sediments based on the concentration of 18 parent PAH and 16 Cl to C4 alkylated homologs. Thus, the removal and/or recovery of PAH is of importance in the remdiation of environmentally compromised sites and/or in the extraction of oil. The following Examples 11 and 12 demonstrate that illustrative Compositions of the Invention are effective for removing or extracting PAH from coal tar or from Athabasca oil sand. Example 11 [00408] In a glass vessel, the aqueous composition of Example 1 (2.5 g) was combined with water (47.5 g) to provide an extractant. Athabasca oil sand (5g) was added to the vessel. The resultant mixture was stirred using a magnetic stir bar for 4 hr at about 23 °C, and an oil ball was formed. The PAH content of the oil sand was measured by GC-MS before and after extraction, to determine the extractant’s extraction efficiency. PAHs whose concentration was detected include naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene, pyrene, chrysene, and C1-C4 homologs thereof. A Ci homolog of a PAH is a PAH having a methyl group. A C2 homolog of a PAH is a PAH having, for example, an ethyl group or two methyl groups. A C3 homolog of a PAH is a PAH having, for example, a methyl and an ethyl group, three methyl groups, an n-propyl group or an i-propyl group. A C4 homolog of a PAH is a PAH having, for example, two ethyl groups, four methyl groups, an ethyl group and two methyl groups, a methyl group and an n-propyl group, a methyl group and an i-propyl group, an n-butyl group, a sec-butyl group, and i-butyl group or a t-butyl group. The results of these analyses are shown in Table 1 below: Table 1 - PAH Concentrations in Oil Sand Before and After Extraction (pg PAH/g Sand) PAH Before Extraction (pg/g) After Extraction (pg/g) Naphthalene not detected not detected Ci homolog not detected not detected C2 homo log not detected not detected C3 homolog not detected not detected C4 homo log not detected not detected Fluorene not detected not detected Ci homolog 3.3 not detected C2 homo log not detected not detected C3 homolog not detected not detected C4 homo log not detected not detected Phenanthrene 3.6 not detected Ci homolog 24.1 0.4 C2 homo log 38.9 0.6 C3 homolog 47.2 0.7 C4 homo log 7.7 not detected Pyrene 5.6 not detected Ci homolog 2.1 not detected C2 homo log not detected not detected C3 homolog not detected not detected C4 homo log not detected not detected Chrysene 2.7 not detected Ci homolog 9.0 not detected C2 homo log 9.2 not detected C3 homolog not detected not detected C4 homo log not detected not detected [00409] This example demonstrates that an illustrative Composition of the Invention useful for extracting PAH-containing oil from a substrate. 118 [00410] Based on the low PAH content of the Athabasca oil sand, as shown in Example 11 above, relative to coal tar, as shown in Example 12, below, it was important to confirm for a larger group of PAH if the percent reduction in PAH content is characteristic of the present extraction methods employing Compositins of the Invention. Thus, a coal tar sand was extracted as described in Example 12, below. Example 12 [00411] In a glass vessel, the aqueous composition of Example 1 (2.5 g) was combined with water (47.5 g) to provide an extractant. Coal tar sand from a North Carolina gasification plant site (5g, 15 wt% coal tar) was added to the extractant. The resultant mixture was stirred using a magnetic stir bar for 90 minutes at about 23 °C. Extraction of the coal tar from the sand was observed after 10 minutes, and a ball of coal tar was observed at 90 minutes. The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content of the coal tar sand was measured by GC-MS before and after above-described extraction to determine the extractant’s extraction efficiency. The results of these analyses are shown in Table 2 below: Table 2 - PAH Concentrations in Coal Tar Sand Before and After Extraction (mg PAH/kg) Sand) PAH Before Extraction After Extraction % Extraction Acenaphthene 1.3 0.0 100 Acenaphthylene 392.4 7.4 98.1 Anthracene 418.8 8.5 98.0 benz[a]anthracene 299.9 6.7 97.8 benzo[a]pyrene 216.1 4.8 97.8 Benzo [b] fluoranthene 103.9 2.6 97.5 benzo [ghi]perylene 77.1 1.7 97.9 benzo [k] fluoranthene 126.6 2.6 98.0 Chrysene 299.3 6.8 97.7 dibenz [ah] anthracene 23.2 0.4 98.1 Fluoranthene 712.5 11.7 98.4 Fluorene 419.5 8.3 98.0 Indeno [ 1,2,3-cd]pyrene 79.9 1.5 98.1 Naphthalene 502.5 8.1 98.4 Phenanthrene 1444.5 31.4 97.8 Pyrene 853.2 15.1 98.2 [00412] This example demonstrates that an illustrative Composition of the Invention is useful for extracting PAH-containing coal tar from a substrate. [00413] The percent decrease in PAH content in the tar sand as shown in Example 12, above, was consistent from homolog to homolog. Since the concentration of the various PAHs measured decreases in similar amounts, these data indicate that the extractant removes PAH from the coal tar sand without selectivity. Example 13 [00414] Athabasca oil sand (5g) was added to a 100 mL glass beaker. An extractant of a mixture of the aqueous composition of Example 1 (2.5 g) in water (47.5 g) was added to the Athabasca oil sand (5g) at about 23 °C. FIGS. 9 and 10 are photographs showing a top-down (FIG. 9) and side (FIG. 10) view of the contents in the beaker before stirring (see also white magnetic stir bar in photograph). Evident in FIGS. 9 and 10 is the lumpiness of the oil sands, and that the sand is completely surrounded by oil. Also shown are air bubbles, produced upon addition of the extractant to the oil sands. In contrast, no bubbles appeared when pouring merely water over the oil sands or when pouring the extractant into an empty beaker. The extractant was yellow in color. [00415] The mixture of extractant and oil sand was then stirred. FIG. 11 is a photograph showing the contents of the beaker after stirring for 4 min, then allowing most of the solids to settle. FIG. 11 shows stringers of oil separating from sand. This result is consistent with conventional, elevated temperature, water-based oil sand extraction processes. FIG. 11 shows separation occurring at room temperature within the same 5 minute timeframe as in current conventional, elevated temperature, water-based oil sand extraction processes. Evident is the change in color of the solution and the appearance of loosely scattered “free” oil and sand particles from the lumpy oil sands. As particles settle, oil-containing sands sit on top of “cleaner” sand as it is beginning to separate from the lumpier oil sands. [00416] FIG. 12 is a photograph showing the contents of the beaker after stirring for 10 minutes. Evident are longer stringers of “free” oil separated from the sands. Conversely, FIG. 13 is a photograph showing sand “free” of oil that has settled to the bottom of the beaker a few minutes after stirring was stopped. FIG 14 is a photograph showing the agglomerating oil deposits sitting on top of the sand after decanting the solution into another beaker. [00417] FIGS. 15-16 are photographs showing the contents of the beaker after stirring 30 minutes and then decanting the solution into a second beaker. FIG. 15 is a photograph of “free” oil sticking to the glass of the beaker in which the oil sand and extractant were stirred, after decanting the extractant liquid comprising some extracted oil into a second beaker. FIG. 16 is a photograph showing the remaining sand and oil in the beaker in which the oil sand and extractant were stirred after decanting the extractant liquid comprising some extracted oil into the second beaker. As shown in FIG. 16, the remaining oil in the bottom of the beaker begins to pool as a dense, non-aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL), which, for the most part, has separated from the sand. [00418] FIG. 17 is a photograph showing the sand, oil and magnetic stir bar remaining in the beaker after stirring for 1 hour and decanting the resultant supernatant. FIG. 18 is a photograph showing the oil remaining on the glass of the first beaker after transferring the sand, oil and extractant to a second beaker. [00419] This example demonstrates that an illustrative Composition of the Invention is useful for extracting oil from Athabasca oil sands. Example 14 [00420] Athabasca oil sand (5 g comprising 15 ± 6 wt% oil and 83 ± 6% sand) was combined with 50 mL of toluene and stirred at about 23 °C. This toluene extraction was repeated seven times for each 5 g sample of Athabasca oil sand. The extractions were performed in triplicate (i.e., three different samples). A total of 2% of the mass of the oil sand was lost during separation of “free” oil from sand. As reported below, mass of oil (wt%) or mass of sand (wt%) are reported as the mass percent of each versus the total sample weight (i.e., mass of oil = oil extracted from Athabasca oil sand (g)/ total mass of original Athabasca oil sand sample (g) χ 100; mass of sand = mass of sand remaining after extraction (g)/mass of original Athabasca oil sand sample (g) χ 100). Variation among the three extractions is reported as RSD (relative standard deviation). A summary of these analyses is shown below in Table 3: Table 3 - Mass Percent Oil and Sand in Athabasca Oil Sand by Solvent Extraction Extraction 1 Extraction 2 Extraction 3 Mass of Oil (wt%) 16% 16% 14% Mass of Sand (wt%) 84% 82% 84% Average Mass of Oil Average Mass of Sand (wt%) 15% (wt%) 83% RSD 6% RSD 1% [00421] The Athabasca oil sand was also analyzed by Alberta Innovates - Technology Futures of Canada to determine its total oil, water and solids content, as shown below in Table 4: Table 4 - Mass Percent Oil, Water and Solids and Sand in Athabasca Oil Sand by Solvent Extraction Total Athabasca Oil Sand (grams) Total Mass Recovered (grams) Oil (grams) Water (grams) Solids (grams) Oil (wt %) Water (wt %) Solids (wt %) Total Recovery (%) 87.03 86.18 10.68 1.00 74.50 12.27 1.15 85.6 99.02 [00422] In a glass vessel, the aqueous composition of Example 1 (2.5 g) was combined with water (47.5 g) to provide an extractant. Athabasca oil sand (5g) was added to the extractant. The mixture of oil sand and extractant was stirred using a magnetic stir bar for 4 hr at about 23 °C. Oil recovery extraction efficiency after 4 hr stirring, based on total oil present in the Athabasca oil sand, was 84 ± 10 wt% based on the oil sand composition as shown in Table 3, above. However, if the oil sand composition data from the analyses performed by Alberta Innovates - Technology Futures of Canada in Table 4 above are used as the baseline for oil content in the oil sands, the extraction efficiency of an illustrative Composition of the Invention approaches 100%. These findings are impressive when contrasted with commercial recoveries of 80-95 wt% of oil from oil sands given that the present illustrative Composition of the Invention was employed at room temperature, whereas commercial extractions processes operate between 35 C and 80 C and need surfactants, steam, and air. [00423] The particle-size distribution of the solids in the Athabasca oil sands was also determined (FIG. 19). The values from the particle size distribution analysis FIG. 19 were as follows: Volume Statistics (Arithmetic) Calculations from 0.375 pm to 2000 μηΐ S.D.: Variance: C,v.: Skewness: i Kuriosis: I Oic: 24.59 pm dsa: 127.9 pm | <10% «25% <50% <75% } 24.59 μηπ 87.78 pm 127,9 pm 1β4.1 μοΐ volume: 100% Mean; 121,8 pm Median: 127.9 pm Mean/Metiian ratio: 0,953 Mode: 153,8 pm 59.13 μπΐ 349« μη^ 48.5% -0.365 Left skewed -0.462 Platykurfic <W 184.4 pm <90% 194.4 pm [00424] In summary, these findings show that an illustrative Composition of the Invention can provide at least as efficient extraction of oil from Athabasca oil sand relative to conventional, elevated temperature, water-based oil sand extraction processes. Example 15 [00425] Athabasca oil sand (5 g) was combined with water (50 g) and stirred 4 hr at room temperature. The resultant mixture did not comprise a Composition of the Invention. [00426] No extraction of oil from the oil sand was observed. Example 16 [00427] To quantify the amount of protein present in illustrative aqueous compositions of the invention, a Biuret assay was employed. Each aqueous composition described in Table 5, below, was assayed to determine total protein concentration in parts per thousand (ppt). In each experiment, a first solution was prepared by dissolving 3.46 g of cupric sulfate in 20 mL of 50 °C water. A second solution was prepared by dissolving 34.6 g of sodium citrate and 20.0 g of sodium carbonate in 80mL of 50 °C water. After allowing the first and second solutions to cool to 23 °C, the first and second solutions were combined and mixed, yielding the Biuret assay reagent. Commercially sourced zein was dissolved in 70% isopropanol, and a calibration curve using various concentrations of zein was constructed. To measure the concentration of protein in the various aqueous compositions listed in Table 5, comprising as defined in Example 24 below, one mL of the aqueous composition was admixed with 1 mL of a 6 parts: 100 (weight/weight) sodium hydroxide solution. To this mixture was added 0.4 mL of the Biuret assay reagent; providing a total volume was 2.4 mL. The test mixture’s absorbance was measured at 545 nm in a 1 cm polystyrene cuvette after approximately 90 minutes. The absorbance was correlated to the calibration curve to provide protein concentration in the test mixture in parts per thousand. The results of the Biuret assay experiments are shown below: Table 5. Protein concentration of Illustrative Aqueous Compositions as Determined via Biuret Assay.

The light tar oil, while less dense than water, adhered to the bottom of the glass beaker. To the first beaker was added approximately 50 mL of water (labeled “water”). To the second beaker was added approximately 50 mL of a solution comprising 5 parts of the composition of Example 1 and 95 parts water by weight (labeled “Example 1”). [00429] FIG. 20 is a series of photographs showing the effects of a solution comprising 5 parts of the composition of Example 1 and 95 parts water by weight versus water on light tar oil. The first photograph, on the far left, shows the light tar oil in the bottom of a glass beaker before the addition of either water or a Composition of the Invention. The top row of photographs is a time-lapse set of images showing the effects of adding water to light tar oil as described. Although the mechanical effect of pouring water spreads the light tar oil apart, it does not disperse the light tar oil in solution. As shown in FIG. 20, stirring with a glass pipette does not disperse the light tar oil; instead the light tar oil sticks to the beaker and the pipette. After vigorous stirring with the pipette, only small balls of light tar oil are formed, which eventually float to the surface. [00430] In contrast, the bottom row of photographs in FIG. 20 illustrates the effect of a solution comprising 5 parts of the composition of Example 1 and 95 parts water by weight on the light tar oil. Immediately upon addition, “stringers” of light tar oil begin to from the tar oil and are released from the mass of tar oil adhering to the bottom of the beaker. Stirring the mixture with a glass pipette, as shown, releases more stringers, and the mixture becomes dark with the amount of released light tar oil. After allowing the mixture to stand for approximately 20 seconds, the light tar oil begins to float to the top of the mixture. This experiment illustrates the ability of a Composition of the Invention to remove light tar oil from a substrate. Example 18 [00431] Approximately 5 mL of coal tar obtained from a utility plant in North Carolina was introduced into each of two glass beakers. The coal tar adhered to the bottom of the glass beaker. To the first beaker was added approximately 50 mL of water (labeled “water”). To the second beaker was added approximately 50 mL of a solution comprising 5 parts of the composition of Example 1 and 95 parts water by weight (labeled “Ex. 1”). [00432] FIG. 21 is a series of photographs showing the effects of a solution comprising 5 parts of the composition of Example 1 and 95 parts water by weight versus water on coal tar. The first photograph, on the far left, shows the coal tar in the bottom of a glass beaker before the addition of either water or a Composition of the Invention. The top row of photographs is a time-lapse set of images showing the effects of adding water to coal tar as described. The mechanical effect of pouring water on coal tar does not disperse any of the coal tar in solution. As shown, stirring with a glass pipette also does not disperse the coal tar; instead the coal tar sticks to the beaker and the pipette. After vigorous stirring with the pipette, no coal tar is released from the mass adhered to the bottom of the beaker. [00433] In contrast, the bottom row of photographs in FIG. 21 illustrates the effect of a solution comprising 5 parts of the composition of Example 1 and 95 parts water by weight on the coal tar. Upon stirring, the coal tar forms stringers in solution. The solution darkens with increased stirring, as more coal tar is liberated from the mass of coal tar adhered to the bottom of the beaker. Upon standing, the coal tar forms balls, which sink to the bottom of the beaker. This experiment illustrates the ability of a Composition of the Invention to remove coal tar from a substrate. Example 19 [00434] Approximately 10 mL of oil-contaminated sludge, comprising sediment and oil, was introduced into each of two glass beakers. To the first beaker was added approximately 50 ml. of water (labeled “water”). To the second beaker was added approximately 50 mL of a solution comprising 5 parts of the composition of Example 1 and 95 parts water by weight (labeled “Ex. 1”). [00435] FIG. 22 is a series of photographs showing the effects of a solution comprising 5 parts of the composition of Example 1 and 95 parts water by weight versus water on oil-contaminated sludge. The first photograph, on the far left, shows the oil-contaminated sludge in the bottom of a glass beaker before the addition of either water or a Composition of the Invention. The top row of photographs is a time-lapse set of images showing the effects of adding water to oil-contaminated sludge as described. The mechanical effect of pouring water on the oil-contaminated sludge breaks up the sludge slightly, but even with subsequent stirring, the majority of the oil-contaminated sludge remains adhered to the bottom of the beaker and the oil from the oil-contaminated sludge does not disperse in the solution. As shown, stirring with a glass pipette does not disperse the oil in the oil-contaminated sludge. [00436] In contrast, the bottom row of photographs in FIG. 22 illustrates the effect of a solution comprising 5 parts of the composition of Example 1 and 95 parts water by weight on the oil-contaminated sludge. Upon stirring, the solution darkens, and oil is liberated from the oil-contaminated sludge. This experiment illustrates the ability of a Composition of the Invention to remove oil from oil-contaminated sludge. Example 20 [00437] Athabasca oil sand (5g) was added to a 100 mL glass beaker. 50 mL of an extractant made by admixing the aqueous composition of Example 1 (2.5 g) and water (47.5 g) was added to the Athabasca oil sand at about 23 °C. The resultant mixture was stirred for 2 hrs. After stirring and allowing the solids to settle, the mixture was decanted and the extracted oil and sand were separated, then dried and weighed to determine recovery of oil. The supernatant recovered after stirring was reserved. A second sample of Athabasca oil sand and clean stir bar was added to a clean beaker, the reserved supernatant was added to the beaker, and the resultant mixture was stirred at 1000 rpm for 2 hours with a magnetic stir bar. This extraction, recovery, and re-use of the reserved supernatant was repeated for a total of 6 extraction iterations. Table 6, below, reports the percent of oil recovered, where the reserved supernatant is re-used for multiple sequential extractions of separate samples of Athabasca oil sands. Table 6. Recovery of oil when extractant is used iteratively. Trial 1 Trial 2 Trial 3 Trial 4 Trial 5 Trial 6 wt% of oil recovered | 90% 89% 86% 99% 93% 106% Average 94% RSD 8% [00438] As can be seen from the results presented in Table 6 above, the total recovery of oil from each 5 g sample of Athabasca oil sand does not change within error over successive extractions with the same extractant. This experiment illustrates the ability of a Composition of the Invention to be reused to remove oil from Athabasca oil sands. Example 21 [00439] Approximately 5 g of Athabasca oil sand (containing 15 wt % oil), 50 mL of a solution comprising 5 parts of the composition of Example 1 and 95 parts water by weight, and a stir bar were added to a small glass beaker and stirred for 10 minutes. The small beaker was placed inside a larger beaker, and the mixture in the small beaker was aerated by introducing air into the mixture via a fritted glass bubbler at 0.15L/min for 10 min. The aeration formed an oilentrained froth which spilled over the sides of the small beaker into the larger beaker. The froth and oil in the larger beaker, and the sand and oil remaining in the small beaker, were each separately collected, dried, and then extracted with a 50/50 (ν/ν) mixture of toluene and dichloromethane. After removal of the toluene/dichloromethane solvent mixture under vacuum, the percent mass of oil recovered from each of the small and larger beakers was calculated to determine the amount of oil carried from the small beaker to the larger beaker by the froth generated during aeration. FIG. 23 is a process flow diagram illustrating the process employed for frothing and extracting oil from Athabasca oils sands. Forty-three wt% of the oil present in the 5 g of Athabasca oil sand was found to have been transported from the small beaker to the larger beaker by the froth generated during aeration. This amount is significant. Unlike the industrial process described herein, wherein oil sands are treated (e.g., stirred with high pH water and aerated) multiple times to remove oil therefrom, the present 43 wt% recovery was effected in a single aeration step. This example illustrates the ability of a Composition of the Invention to remove oil from Athabasca oil sand using aeration. [00440] FIG. 24 is a series of photographs from three aeration experiments performed as described above, but without recovery and quantification of oil in the small and larger beakers, to qualitatively assess the frothing properties of the present Compositions of the Invention when aerated. The experiments employed (i) a solution comprising 5 parts of the composition of Example 1 and 95 parts water by weight (labeled “Ex. 1”), (ii) a solution comprising 5 parts of composition 2.2.8 (as described in Example 24 below) and 95 parts water by weight (labeled “2.2.8”), and (iii) a solution comprising 5 parts of composition 8.1 (as described in Example 24 below) and 95 parts water by weight (labeled “8.1”). All three photographs in FIG. 25 show froth with entrained oil being carried out of the small beaker and into the larger beaker. This example illustrates the ability of Compositions of the Invention to remove oil from Athabasca oil sand with aeration. Example 22 [00441] Approximately 5 g of coal tar sand was placed in a glass beaker. 50 mL of an extractant made by admixing the aqueous composition of Example 1 (2.5 g) and water (47.5 g) was added to the beaker at about 23 °C. The resultant mixture was stirred for 2 hours, then aerated for 10 minutes as described in Example 21. FIG. 25 is a series of two photographs illustrating the results. Coal tar from the coal tar sand is initially carried out with the froth, but its lower portion contains little or no coal tar (see photograph on the left in FIG. 25). After briefly agitating the sand and coal tar at the bottom of the beaker during aeration of the mixture, additional coal tar was carried out by the froth produced during aeration (see photograph on the right in FIG. 25). This example illustrates the ability of a Composition of the Invention to remove coal tar from coal tar sand with aeration. Example 23 [00442] FIG. 26 is a series of photographs showing the settling effect on suspended fines by reducing the pH of a solution comprising 5 parts of the composition of Example 1 and 95 parts water by weight, after extraction and removal of extracted oil from a 5 g sample of Athabasca oil sand. Athabasca oil sand (5g) was added to a 100 mL glass beaker. 50 mL of an extractant made by admixing the aqueous composition of Example 1 (2.5 g) and water (47.5 g) was added to the Athabasca oil sand at about 23 °C. The resultant mixture was stirred for 2 hrs. After stirring, the mixture was decanted, extracted oil and sand were removed from the decanted mixture, and the remaining mixture, comprising suspended fines, was placed in a 100 mL glass beaker, was then acidified from pH 13 to pH 4.7. The pH of the mixture was then adjusted to 4.6, and as shown in FIG. 26, the fines in the mixture were precipitated over a 160 second time period. In addition, residual oil in the mixture was observed to rise to the top of the mixture concurrent with the observed precipitation of fines. This example illustrates that acidification of a Composition of the Invention, after extraction and removal of oil from Athabasca oil sand, can effect precipitation of fines. Example 24 [00443] A series of Experiments was performed to evaluate illustrative compositions of the invention prepared using various plant sources, and to assess the effect of various components in Compositions of the Invention. Each composition was prepared by the method described in Experiment 1, then 5 parts by weight of it were admixed with 95 parts by weight of water to provide a solution of the composition to be tested. The contents of each composition are described in Tables 7-18, below. All experiments employed the method for extracting light tar oil as described in Example 17, using the light tar oil described therein. EXPERIMENT SERIES 1 [00444] Experiment series 1 was performed as shown in Table 7, employing corn gluten meal as the plant source.

These experiments illustrate that Compositions of the Invention are effective in removing oil from a substrate. Example 25 [00468] Compositions 10.2.1 and 12.2.6 as described in Example 24, above, were lyophilized, either before centrifugation, or after centrifugation to remove solids and gel formed during preparation. In addition, the Composition of Example 2 was lyophilized after its preparation by the method below. [00469] Lyophilization was performed by placing each composition in a 50 mL loosely covered plastic vial, immersing the vial in liquid nitrogen for 30 min, then placing the vial in a bench-top manifold freeze dryer and applying vacuum (approximately 10~2 torr) for 48 hours. The compositions were weighed before and after lyophilization. The amount of liquid removed was determined by the difference between the initial mass of the composition prior to lyophilization and its mass after lyophilization. The results are reported in Table 19, below. Table 19 - Mass of Solids Recovered and Liquid Removed in Centrifugation of Exemplary Compositions of the Invention Expt. # Mass of Solids (g) Mass of Liquid Removed (g) 10.2.1 - Centrifuged 2.704 20.921 10.2.1 -Non-centrifuged 2.723 21.307 12.2.6 - Centrifuged 2.723 11.395 12.2.6 - Non-centrifuged 5.497 21.647 Example 2 - Centrifuged 3.492 21.139 [00470] The recovered solids from each composition were reconstituted with water. Reconstitution was performed in each of two ways: 1) adding water to provide a solution having a concentration equal to 5 parts of the composition prior to lyophilization and 95 parts water; and 2) by reconstituting the solids to provide a mixture having the same mass as the composition prior to lyophilization, then admixing 5 parts of the reconstituted mixture and 95 parts water. No observable differences were observed in preparing the compositions using the two reconstitution methods. [00471] The efficacy of the reconstituted materials for extraction of light tar oil, extraction of coal tar, and frothing and extraction of Athabasca sand was assessed using methods described herein. The compositions were observed to perform essentially the same as comparable, ηοηlyophilized, non-reconstituted counterparts in each experiment. [00472] These experiments illustrate that lyophilized and reconstituted Compositions of the Invention are effective for removing oil from a substrate, for extracting coal tar from coal tar sands, and for removing oil from Athabasca oil sand using frothing. Example 26 [00473] An illustrative aqueous Composition of the Invention comprising plant material, but not comprising polysaccharide other than that present in or derived from the plant material, was prepared as follows. Citric acid (0.086 grams) was dissolved in 15.89 mL of 70% isopropanol at about 23 °C. Zein (26.5 g) was added, and the resultant mixture was allowed to stir for 2 hours. 15.89 g of a 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution was added to 237.8 g of water, the resultant diluted sodium hydroxide solution was added to the isopropanol/zein mixture, and the resultant mixture was allowed to stand for 6 hours. Sodium chloride (0.159 g) was then added, also with stirring. The resultant mixture was then allowed to stand for an additional 2 hours. S-type hydrated lime (1.58 g) was then added with stirring, and the resultant mixture was stirred until uniform. The solids were allowed to settle, and the supernatant was decanted to provide the illustrative aqueous composition as the decanted supernatant. [00474] In a glass vessel, (2.5 g) of the aqueous composition prepared as described in paragraph [0256] was combined with water (47.5 g) to provide an extractant. Coal tar sand (5g, 15 wt% coal tar) from a North Carolina gasification plant site was added to the extractant. The resultant mixture was stirred using a magnetic stir bar for 90 minutes at about 23 °C. Extraction of the coal tar from the coal tar sand was observed. [00475] This example demonstrates that an illustrative Composition of the Invention is useful for extracting coal tar from coal tar sand. Example 27 [00476] A comparative composition comprising a polysaccharide, but not comprising plant material, was prepared as follows. Guar gum (1.978 g), citric acid (0.086 g), 15.89 mL of 70% isopropanol, sodium chloride (0.159 g), S-type hydrated lime (1.58 g) and 15.89 g of a 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution were added to 237.8 g of water at about 23 °C. The resultant mixture was stirred until uniform. [00477] In a glass vessel, (2.5 g) of the comparative composition prepared as described in paragraph [0259] was combined with water (47.5 g) to provide a test extractant. Coal tar sand (5g, 15 wt% coal tar) from a North Carolina gasification plant site was added to the test extractant. The resultant mixture was stirred using a magnetic stir bar for 90 minutes at about 23 °C. No extraction of the coal tar from the coal tar sand was observed. Example 28 [00478] The weight percentage of protein, fat, fiber and carbohydrate was determined for Compositions of the Invention comprising soybean or hulled hemp seeds as the plant protein. The protein, fat, fiber and carbohydrate content of soybean and hulled hemp seeds is described in Table 20, below. Table 20. Composition of soybean and hulled hemp seed. Soybean Hulled Hemp Seeds Protein 36.5 % 33.3% Fat 19.9 % 46.7% Fiber 9.3% 6.7% Carbohydrate 30.2% 20.0% Example 29 [00479] An illustrative aqueous composition of the invention comprising hemp, but not comprising polysaccharide other than that present in or derived from the plant material, was prepared employing ΗΝΟ3 instead of NaOH: [00480] Citric acid (0.14 grams) was dissolved in 22.8 mL of 70% isopropanol at about 23 °C. Hulled hemp seed (56.838 g) was added, and the resultant mixture was stirred until homogenous, then allowed to stand for 2 hours. The resultant mixture was added to 284 mL of 2.0 Μ ΗΝΟ3, and stirred 12 hours. Guar gum (2.84 g) and sodium chloride (0.23 g) wetted with 70% isopropanol was then added to hemp mixture with stirring, then allowed to stand an additional 3 hours. Calcium hydroxide (2.27 g) in 20 mL of distilled water was then added, and the resultant mixture was stirred until uniform then allowed to stand for 12 hours. The solids were were filtered from the solution using a paint filter. The pH of the filtrate was then adjusted to pH 12.7 by adding 50 wt% sodium hydroxide solution with stirring. The pH 12.7 filtrate was then centrifuged for 20 minutes at 1,150 G. FIG. 27 is a photograph showing an aliquot of a pH 12.7 hemp-based composition, prepared by acid treatment of hemp seed, after centrifugation. As shown in FIG. 27, the solution forms three layers after centrifugation; the middle layer comprises protein from the hemp seed. [00481] An aliquot of the centrifuged filtrate (3 mL) was then admixed with water (27 mL) to provide a 10 wt% solution of centrifuged hemp-based composition, which had a pH of 12.7. 2 g of a mixture of #2 and #4 Monarch oil was added to the solution. FIG. 28Α is a photograph showing the mixture of #2 and #4 Monarch oil after addition to a 10 wt% solution of the uncentrifuged hemp-based composition. As can be seen in FIG. 28Α, the 10 wt% solution of the uncentrifuged hemp-based composition produces stringers of Monarch oil. [00482] An aliquot of the uncentrifuged filtrate (3 mL) was also admixed with water (27 mL) to provide a 10 wt% solution of uncentrifuged hemp-based composition, which had a pH of 12.7. 2 g of coal tar was added to the solution. FIG. 28Β is a photograph showing coal tar after addition to a 10 wt% solution of the centrifuged hemp-based composition. As shown in FIG. 28Β, the 10 wt% solution of the centrifuged hemp-based composition produced stringers of coal tar. This Example demonstrates that compositions of the invention produced by acid treatment of a plant material are useful in extracting hydrocarbon-containing oil or coal tar from a substrate. Example 30 [00483] The sprouting process of a grain changes its protein and carbohydrate profiles as the proteins (enzymes) are used to process the carbohydrates (starches) into energy for the plant to grow. Malting a grain is the process by which a grain is steeped in water and aerated to begin the sprouting process, then heated to stop the starch conversion at a certain point. Sprouting of soybeans prior to their use in the preparation of illustrative Compositions of the Invention was conducted by rinsing soybeans with water 5 times, then placing the soybeans on damp paper towels covered with a layer of damp paper towels, then covering the damp paper towels with aluminum foil to prevent evaporation. The damp beans were placed in the dark for about 2 days until sprouts appeared. [00484] An illustrative Composition of the Invention, prepared as described in Example 1, but substituting sprouted soybean for corn gluten meal, was prepared (the “soybean sprout-based composition”). A 10 wt% solution of the soybean sprout-based composition was prepared by combining 2 g of the soybean sprout-based composition with 18 g of water. 2 g of a mixture of #2 and #4 Monarch oil was added to the 10 wt% solution with stirring. The #2 and #4 Monarch oil was emulsified by the 10 wt% soybean sprout-based solution. [00485] A second 10 wt% solution of the soybean sprout-based composition was prepared by combining 5 g of the soybean sprout-based composition with 45 g of water. 5g of a coal tar coated sand, comprising about 10:1 sand to tar by mass, was added to the solution with stirring. After three hours of stirring, the coal tar was separated from the sand and formed balls in the second 10 wt% soybean sprout-based solution. [00486] A third 10 wt% solution of the soybean sprout-based composition was prepared by combining 5 g of the soybean sprout-based composition with 45 g of water. 5g of a coal tar coated sand, comprising about 10:1 sand to tar by mass, was added to the solution with stirring. After three hours of stirring, the coal tar was separated from the sand and formed balls in the third 10 wt% soybean sprout-based solution. Example 31 [00487] Biodiesel was prepared by combining 90 g of vegetable oil with 19.2 g of methanol (with 1% by mass ΚΟΗ dissolved in the methanol prior to mixing with the vegetable oil) to vegetable oil,. Biodiesel is made by the catalytic trans-esterification of triglycerides (fats) which make up vegetable oils using methanol with a catalytic amount of hydroxide, as shown in Scheme 1, below. Scheme 1. Illustrative transesterification of triglycerides with methanol (HORi) with catalytic OH' to make biodiesel. [00488] Biodiesel prepared as described above surpassed the efficacy of petroleum diesel in dissolving the #6 oil, i.e., it was the better solvent. The aqueous composition of Example 1 (1 g) was combined with water (19 g) to provide an extractant. When the extractant was combined in a 1:1 ratio with biodiesel prepared as described above, an emulsion was formed, unlike the phase separation observed when the extractant was combined with petroleumbased diesel in ratios ranging from 1:10 to 10:1 diesel to extractant. Example 32 [00489] 3.204 g of methanol was combined with 90 g of vegetable oil and stirred overnight to provide a partially trans-esterified glycerides (PTEG) mixture comprising triglycerides, diglycerides, monoglycerides, and fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). 2 g of the PTEG solution was combined with 2 g of #6 oil, and the PTEG was observed to be miscible with the #6 oil. However, when 10 mL of the PTEG solution was combined with 10 mL a solution comprising 2.5 g of the composition of Example 1 in 47.5 g of water, the resultant mixture formed an emulsion which persisted for about 1 hour. Example 33 [00490] To examine the emulsifying characteristics of a mixture of PTEG and an illustrative composition of the invention, 1 mL of the PTEG solution was combined with 10 mL of a solution comprising 2.5 g of the composition of Example 35 in 47.5 g of water and 1 mL of d-limonene. A solvent-in water emulsion was formed and was visually observed to persist for 1 hour, significantly longer than the emulsion observed when 1 mL of the PTEG solution was combined with 10 mL a solution comprising 2.5 g of the composition of Example 1 in 47.5 g of water. Example 34 [00491] # 6 Fuel oil contains approximately 25% asphaltenes. Because coal tar does not float in a solution comprising 3 g of the Composition of Example 35 and 27 g of water, a de-asphaltened coal tar sample was tested. The de-asphaltened coal tar was prepared by placing approximately 50 g of neat coal tar in a 4L glass bottle. Pentane was added to cover the coal tar layer and a stir bar used to stir the pentane. The pentane was removed every two days and set aside, fresh pentane was replaced in the bottle. This procedure was repeated seven times. The pentane, containing de-asphaltened coal tar, was evaporated under a gentle flow of air overnight to obtain pure de-asphaltened coal tar. A few drops of the de-asphaltened coal tar was added to a solution comprising 2.5 g of the composition of Example 1 in 47.5 g of water, and did not float. [00492] To liberate coal tar or oil from Athabasca oil sand, experiments including stirring a sample with a stirbar and frothing the solution by aerating the solution with compressed air have been performed (see, e.g., Examples 21 and 22). As when stirring a mixture of a composition of the invention and Athabasca oil sand, frothing can produce coagulated mass of tar-enriched sand. FIG. 29 is a photograph of an illustrative frothing apparatus. The elution chamber is configured to receive a sample of material from which a hydrocarbon-containing substance (e.g., oil, coal tar) is to be extracted. Air can be introduced into the apparatus from the bottom of the chamber. [00493] FIG. 30 is a photograph showing shows a sample comprising homogenized 5 wt% coal tar/95 wt% sand, in the bottom of the frothing apparatus of FIG. 29, before frothing. As shown in FIG. 31, the coal tar (black) is dispersed relatively uniformLy throughout the sand. 500 mL of a solution comprising 50 g of the composition of Example 35 and 450 g of water was placed in the apparatus of FIG. 29. After three hours of aeration, with air flow at approximately 60psi through the coal tar/sand mixture, the tar is stripped from the sand, becoming suspended in the liquid. FIG. 31 is a photograph showing a sample comprising homogenized 5 wt% coal tar/95 wt% sand, in the bottom of the frothing apparatus of FIG. 29 after three hours of aeration with air at 60 psi. As shown in FIG. 31, coal tar is concentrated at the top of the sand, with clean sand below it. [00494] A 10 wt% solution of the composition of Example 35 was prepared by combining 50 g of the soybean sprout-based composition with 450 g of water. The solution was placed into the aeration apparatus of FIG. 29. 5g of a coal tar coated sand, comprising about 10:1 sand to tar by mass, was added to the solution, and the mixture was aerated. Time series experiments were performed, observing the aeration at half-hour intervals. After 30 min of aeration, most of the sand in sections where aeration was optimum was clean. However, after 3 hrs there were pockets of coal tar due to poor aeration. Example 35 [00495] An illustrative aqueous composition of the invention comprising plant material, but not comprising polysaccharide other than that present in or derived from the plant material, was prepared as follows. Citric acid (1.07 grams) was dissolved in 0.156 kg of 70% isopropanol at about 23 °C.

Approximately 220 ml. of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 at approximately 40 °C, and having a pH of 13.9, was added to the bacon fat in the beaker. The bacon fat and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 were then admixed by shaking the mixture by hand for approximately 300 seconds. A 16 mesh stainless steel wire screen was placed over a second glass beaker, and the admixture of bacon fat and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 was poured through the screen into the second glass beaker. The bacon fat was almost completely emulsified in the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24. [00544] This example demonstrates that a Composition of the Invention is effective at breaking apart and emulsifying bacon fat. Example 73 [00545] Bacon fat (approximately 10 g) was added to a glass beaker. Approximately 220 ml. of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 at approximately 70 °C, and having a pH of 13.9, was added to the bacon fat in the beaker. The bacon fat and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 were then admixed by shaking the mixture by hand for approximately 300 seconds. A 16 mesh stainless steel wire screen was placed over a second glass beaker, and the admixture of bacon fat and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 was poured through the screen into the second glass beaker. The bacon fat was almost completely emulsified in the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24. [00546] This example demonstrates that a Composition of the Invention is effective at breaking apart and emulsifying bacon fat. Example 74 [00547] Grease traps located over a cooking surface and mounted in an exhaust hood in a commercial kitchen were removed and placed on a concrete surface. Figure 53Α is a photograph showing two of the grease traps prior to cleaning, with significant deposits of grease generated from cooking on the surfaces of the grease trap. Approximately 1 gallon of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 was applied with a sponge to the surfaces of the grease traps. The grease traps were allowed to stand for 5 minutes with the solution thereon, then sprayed with approximately 6 L of water at 23 °C through a low pressure spraying wand at 30-45 psi for approximately 2 minutes. The surfaces of the grease traps were then wiped dry. Figure 53Β is a photograph showing the two grease traps after cleaning. As can be seen in Figure 53Β, the surfaces of the grease traps were completely freed of the grease generated from cooking. [00548] This example demonstrates that a Composition of the Invention is effective at removing grease generated from cooking from a substrate. Example 75 [00549] A cooking surface and stainless steel surround having a surface area of approximately 300 ft2 was sprayed with approximately 3 gallons of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 over a 15 min period with a low pressure spraying wand at 30-45 psi. Figure 54Α is a photograph showing the cooking surface and stainless steel surround prior to cleaning, with significant deposits of grease generated from cooking on the surfaces of the cooking surface and stainless steel surround. The cooking surface and stainless steel surround were allowed to stand for 5 minutes with the solution thereon, then sprayed with approximately 50 L of water at 23 °C through a high pressure spraying wand at approximately 1000 psi for 5 minutes. The surfaces of the cooking surface and the stainless steel surround were then wiped dry. Figure 54Β is a photograph showing the cooking surface and the stainless steel surround after cleaning. As can be seen in Figure 54Β, the surfaces of the cooking surface and the stainless steel surround were completely freed of the grease generated from cooking. [00550] This example demonstrates that a Composition of the Invention is effective at removing grease generated from cooking from a substrate. Example 76 [00551] An in-line wastewater grease trap having a volume of approximately 40 gallons, located downstream from a floor drain in a commercial kitchen, and configured to separate grease generated from cooking in wastewater effluent, was observed to be completely blocked with cooking grease. Figure 55Α is a photograph showing the grease trap completely blocked with grease generated from cooking prior to cleaning. Figure 56Α is another photograph showing the grease trap completely blocked with grease generated from cooking prior to cleaning. The ingress and exit valves to the grease trap were closed, and to the grease trap and the grease generated from cooking contained therein was added about 3 gallons of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 over about 2 mins. Immediately upon mechanical agitation of the admixture of grease and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24, the grease generated from cooking was observed to liquefy, forming a viscous liquid mixture. The admixture was allowed stand for approximately 9 hours, and remained liquid after standing. Figure 55Β is a photograph showing the viscous liquid mixture formed by admixing the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 with the grease generated from cooking in the grease trap. The viscous liquid was then removed from the grease trap with a vacuum pump. Figure 56Β is a photograph showing the grease trap after removal of the viscous liquid mixture. As can be seen in Figure 56Β, the grease trap is freed of the grease generated from cooking. [00552] This example demonstrates that a Composition of the Invention is effective at liquefying grease generated from cooking in an in-line wastewater grease trap and facilitating the removal of grease generated from cooking from a blocked in-line wastewater grease trap. Example 77 [00553] A wastewater lift station well (approximately 13 ft deep, 7 ft in diameter), containing a grinder to macerate inflowing solids, and configured to receive wastewater and pump that wastewater to a downstream wastewater treatment facility, was observed to be blocked with grease deposits. Figure 57a is a photograph showing the well of the lift station blocked with a mat of grease, oil and fat from a residential wastewater stream (approximately 1 ft. thick) prior to cleaning. Figure 57b is a photograph showing the surface of the grease mat in the well of the lift station. Approximately 2 gallons of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 was sprayed onto the grease, oil and fat from a residential wastewater stream through a trombone sprayer over about 5 minutes. The solution was allowed to stand on the mat of grease, oil and fat from a residential wastewater stream for about 10 minutes. The mat of grease, oil and fat from a residential wastewater stream was observed to break up upon mechanical agitation with a rake. [00554] This example demonstrates that a Composition of the Invention is effective at breaking up a mat of grease, oil and fat from a residential wastewater stream in a wastewater lift station well and facilitating the removal of grease, oil and fat from a residential wastewater stream from a wastewater lift station well. Example 78 [00555] To a wastewater lift station well (approximately 13 ft deep, 7 ft in diameter), containing a grinder to macerate inflowing solids, and configured to receive wastewater and pump that wastewater to a downstream wastewater treatment facility, was added 20 mL of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 over one minute using a peristaltic pump and rubber tubing. The addition of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 was repeated every 15 minutes. Figure 57c is a photograph showing the apparatus employed for addition of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24. The solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 was added directly into the well, which had an observable mat of grease, oil and fat from a residential wastewater stream across the top of the well before treatment. Figure 57d is a photograph showing the addition of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 to the top of the mat of grease, oil and fat from a residential wastewater stream in the lift station well. The solution was observed to create a hole through the mat of grease, oil and fat from a residential wastewater stream upon addition. After one week of treatment with the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 as described above, no mat or buildup of grease, oil and fat from a residential wastewater stream was observed in the well. After 3 months of treatment, employing approximately 24 gallons of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24, no observable mat or buildup of grease, oil and fat from a residential wastewater stream had been formed. [00556] This example demonstrates that a Composition of the Invention is effective at breaking up a mat of grease, oil and fat from a residential wastewater stream in a wastewater lift station well and facilitating the removal of grease, oil and fat from a residential wastewater stream from a wastewater lift station well. This example further demonstrates that a Composition of the Invention is effective at preventing buildup or mat formation of grease, oil and fat from a residential wastewater stream in a wastewater lift station well. Example 79 [00557] To determine the chemical composition of bacon fat after contacting with a Composition of the Invention, bacon fat obtained from a commercial kitchen and triolein were each contacted with a Composition of the Invention. Triolein was used as an illustrative fat, whose structure is shown below, ο Λ 0“\ O'-: d NS \ produces three equivalents of oleic acid, simplifying the analysis of the products produced by contacting triolein with a Composition of the Invention, and allowing for qualitative comparison with bacon fat before and after it is contacted with a Composition of the Invention. [00558] To determine the chemical composition of the bacon fat after contacting with a Composition of the Invention, standard solutions of triolein, oleic acid and bacon fat, each having a concentration of approximately 3x10-4 Μ, were prepared, assuming a molar mass of 900 g/mol for bacon fat, and the solutions were analyzed via thin layer chromatography (TLC). Triolein (“T,” left spot), oleic acid (“O,” middle spot), and the bacon fat (right spot) were spotted onto plastic backed silica gel 60 (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) plates and eluted with 80:20:1 hexanes:diethyl ether: acetic acid. Plates were visualized with iodine. Figure 58a is a photograph showing the results of TLC analysis of triolein (left), oleic acid (center), and bacon fat (right). As can be seen in Figure 58a, bacon fat and triolein exhibited similar Rf values. Visible in the bacon fat lane are small amounts of free fatty acid(s), identifiable by their similar Rf to oleic acid. [00559] Approximately 0.25 g of bacon fat was then contacted with 11.2 mL of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 for 48 hr at 80 °C. The solution was then cooled to 23 °C, diluted 10:1 with water, saturated with sodium chloride and then centrifuged. After centrifugation, the pellet was dissolved in HPLC grade methanol, dried over sodium sulfate, passed through a lpm PTFE syringe filter, and then re-diluted with methanol. Triolein, oleic acid and the dilution of the admixture of bacon fat and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 in methanol were spotted onto a TLC plate and eluted with 80:20:1 hexanes:diethyl ether: acetic acid. Figure 58b is a photograph showing the results of TLC analysis of triolein (left), oleic acid (center), and the admixture of bacon fat and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24. As can be seen in Figure 58b, oleic acid and the admixture of bacon fat and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24, exhibited similar Rf values, indicating that the bacon fat was converted to free fatty acid by the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24. [00560] Since triglycerides are only slightly soluble in the methanol, a sample of the admixture of bacon fat and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24, was extracted with hexanes to verify that insolubility of any triglycerides remaining after contacting bacon fat and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24. Approximately 0.25g of cooking grease was contacted with approximately 11.2 ml of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 for 48 hr at 80°C. The admixture of bacon fat and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 was then cooled to 23 °C and extracted with hexanes. The hexanes extract of the admixture of bacon fat and the solution was spotted against triolein and oleic acid. Figure 58c is a photograph showing the results of TLC analysis of triolein (left), oleic acid (center), and the hexanes extract of the admixture of bacon fat and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 (right). As can be seen in Figure 58c, no material was visualized in the bacon fat lane having an Rf similar to that of triolein, suggesting that no bacon fat remained in the hexanes extract of the admixture of bacon fat and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24, suggesting quantitative conversion of the bacon fat to one or more fatty acids. [00561] A sample of pure triolein was also treated with the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24. Approximately 0.25 g of triolein with 11.2 mL of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 were admixed and allowed to stand for 48 hr at 80°C. The admixture of triolein and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 was then cooled to 23 °C and diluted 10:1 with water, then saturated with sodium chloride and centrifuged. After centrifugation, the top layer was dissolved in HPLC grade methanol, dried over sodium sulfate, passed through a lpm PTFE syringe filter, and then re-diluted with methanol. Triolein, oleic acid and the admixture of triolein and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 in methanol were spotted onto a TLC plate and eluted with 80:20:1 hexanes:diethyl ether: acetic acid. Figure 58d is a photograph showing the results of TLC analysis of triolein (left), oleic acid (center), and the admixture of triolein and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 (right). As can be seen in Figure 58d, no material was visualized in the lane of admixture of triolein and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24, having an Rf similar to that of triolein, indicating that no triolein remained and suggesting quantitative conversion of triolein to oleic acid. [00562] This example demonstrates that a Composition of the Invention, when admixed with triolein, saponifies the triolein nearly quantitatively, yielding the corresponding free acid, oleic acid. Example 80 [00563] To confirm the TLC observations described in Example 79, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was used to identify the material present after treatment of triolein with a Composition of the Invention. Negative ion ESI was employed to detect oleic acid and positive ion ESI was employed to detect triolein under the following conditions: 5.5 kV spray voltage, sheath gas flow rate 10 (arbitrary units), 280 °C capillary temperature, 38V capillary voltage, 110V tube lens voltage, and scan range m/z 150-1500. Sample flow rate into the mass spectrometer was 10 pL/min. Triolein was admixed with solution 10.2.1 of Example 24, prepared with no sodium chloride, for 24 hours at room temperature at 150 rpm on a laboratory orbital shaker. The admixture of triolein and the solution 10.2.1 of Example 24 was then diluted 10:1 with water, saturated with sodium chloride, and centrifuged. The supernatant was dissolved in HPLC grade methanol, dried over sodium sulfate, passed through a 1 pm PTFE syringe filter, and then re-diluted with methanol. After dilution in methanol to approximately 2 μΜ (based on the molecular weight of 282 g/mol for oleic acid), this solution, triolein and oleic acid were fortified with 100 μΜ ammonium acetate to promote ionization. [00564] Figure 59a is a chromatograph showing the positive-ion mass spectrum of triolein. As expected, the peak at m/z 902, attributable to an NH4+ ion adduct of triolein, was observed. Figure 59b is a chromatograph showing the negative-ion mass spectrum of triolein. The absence of an oleic acid peak at m/z 281 in Figure 59b confirmed the TLC observation of Example 79 that no free oleic acid was present triolein standard. [00565] Figure 59c is a chromatograph showing the positive-ion mass spectrum of oleic acid. No triolein peak was observed. Figure 59d is a chromatograph showing the negative-ion mass spectrum of oleic acid. The absence of a triolein peak at m/z 281 in Figure 59d confirms the TLC observation of Example 79 that no triolein was present in the oleic acid standard. [00566] Figure 60a is a chromatograph showing the positive-ion mass spectrum of an admixture of triolein and solution 10.2.1 of Example 24, prepared with no sodium chloride. Figure 60b is a chromatograph showing the negative-ion mass spectrum of an admixture of triolein and solution 10.2.1 of Example 24, prepared with no sodium chloride. As can be seen in Figure 60a and Figure 60b, no peaks corresponding to triolein were observed, and peaks corresponding to oleic acid were observed. To ensure these results were not attributable to sample dilution, the samples were concentrated ten times and spectra were collected. [00567] Figure 60c is a chromatograph showing the positive-ion mass spectrum of a 10 times concentration of the admixture of triolein and solution 10.2.1 of Example 24, prepared with no sodium chloride, used to generate the chromatogram shown in Figure 60a. Figure 60d is a chromatograph showing the negative-ion mass spectrum of a 10 times concentration of the admixture of triolein and solution 10.2.1 of Example 24, prepared with no sodium chloride, used to generate the chromatogram shown in Figure 60b. As can be seen in Figure 60c and Figure 60d, no peaks corresponding to triolein were observed, and peaks corresponding to oleic acid were observed. [00568] This example demonstrates that a Composition of the Invention, when admixed with triolein, saponifies triolein nearly quantitatively, yielding the corresponding free acid, oleic acid. Example 81 [00569] A Composition of the Invention was tested to determine its antibacterial and antifungal properties. The solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 and aqueous dilutions thereof were prepared. Water (90 mL) and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 (10 mL) were admixed to provide a 10 % (ν/ν) solution of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24. Water (80 mL) and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 (20 mL) were admixed to provide a 20 % (ν/ν) solution of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24. Water (70 mL) and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 (30 mL) were admixed to provide a 30 % (ν/ν) solution of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24. Water (60 mL) and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 (40 mL) were admixed to provide a 10 % (ν/ν) solution of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24. Water (50 mL) and the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 (40 mL) were admixed to provide a 50 % (ν/ν) solution of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24. [00570] Each solution (10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% solution of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24) was tested for antimicrobial activity. A table describing the test organisms and results of the test is below: Table 21: Antibacterial and Antifungal Properties Sample Test Organism Result 10% solution Ε.

Coli negative Salmonella species negative Staphylococcus aureus negative Candida albicans <10 CFU/g Aspergillus niger (103 CFU/mL) negative Aspergillus niger (107 CFU/mL) negative [00571] Protocols for the testing described in Table 21, above were as follows. [00572] As described in USP <61> Microbiological Examination of Nonsterile Products Microbial Enumeration Tests (http://www.usp.org/sites/default/files/usp_pdf/EN/USPNF/generalChapter61 .pdf) and USP <62> Microbiological Examination of Nonsterile Products -Tests for Specified Organisms (http://www.usp.org/sites/default/files/usp_pdf/EN/USPNF/generalChapter62.pdf), standardized stable suspensions of Ε. coli, S. aureus and Salmonella enterica were prepared. Each species tested was suspended in a soybean-casein digest broth and incubated at 30-45 °C for 18-24 hours to form a standard inoculum solution. [00573] As described in USP <2022> Microbiological Procedures for Absence of Specified Microorganisms (http://www.uspbpep.com/usp29/v29240/usp29nf24s0_c2022.html), standard Sabouraud dextrose agar solid media was used for Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger testing. Inoculum for Candida albicans was prepared on Sabouraud dextrose agar plates, which were inoculated with Candida albicans and grown to 25 to 250 cfu/g. For Aspergillus niger testing, standard inoculum was prepared by suspending Aspergillus niger in a soybean-casein digest broth and incubating at 30-45 °C for 18-24 hours. Two inoculation solutions were prepared, one containing 103 cfu/mL, and one containing 107 cfu/mL. [00574] As described in USP <62> Microbiological Examination of Nonsterile Products Tests for Specified Organisms, for Ε. coli and S. aureus testing, 10 mL of each test solution was added to individual samples of standard inoculum solution. For Salmonella enterica testing, 25 mL of each test solution was added to individual samples of standard inoculum solution. [00575] For Candida albicans, 10 mL of each test solution was added to individual Sabouraud dextrose agar plates inoculated with Candida albicans. For A. niger testing, 10 mL of each test solution was added to individual Sabouraud dextrose agar plates inoculated with either 103 cfu/mL or 107 cfu/mL standard inoculum of of A. niger. [00576] For Ε. coli, S. aureus, S. enterica and C. albicans, the cultures were then incubated at 30-35 °C for 32-48 hrs, and the tubes/plates were inspected for growth of colonies. For A. niger, the Sabouraud dextrose agar plates were incubated at 30-35 °C for 72 hours, then visually inspected for growth. For Ε. coli, S. aureus, Salmonella enterica and A. niger, visually identifiable growth of colonies in the medium constituted a “positive” result. Lack of visually identifiable growth of colonies in the medium constituted a “negative” result. For Candida albicans, the number of colony forming units on the plate per gram of media was counted, and the number of colony forming units was reported. [00577] This example demonstrates that a Composition of the Invention is effective at inhibiting the growth of Ε. coli, S. aureus, S. enterica, C. Albans and A. niger. Example 83 [00578] The solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 was added to a wastewater pump station connected a wastewater treatment plant for approximately 3 months. The solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 was introduced continuously into the pump station wet well, which had been a constant operation and maintenance problem due to the accumulation of oil and grease mats. Previously, the station had required weekly cleaning to remove accumulated fat, oil and grease. No cleanouts have been required over the course of the three months in which the pump station has been treated with the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24. In addition, no accumulation of grease downstream of the pump station along a 3 mile gravity drain sewer main has been observed. Furthermore, no adverse impact of addition of the solution of experiment 10.2.1 in Table 6 of Example 24 has been observed, including but not limited to changes in effluent quality, settling characteristics of the wastewater plant mixed-liquor or any change in chemical demands of the wastewater treatment process. [00579] This example demonstrates that a Composition of the Invention is effective at preventing buildup and mat formation of grease, oil and fat from a residential wastewater stream in a wastewater pump station and does not adversely affect a wastewater treatment facility downstream from the pump station.
