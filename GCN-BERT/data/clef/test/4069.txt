Example 27
Preparation of N-(4-Amino-2,6-difluorophenyl)-2-chloro-5-((1R,3R)-2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzamide (F1027)
To a solution of 2-chloro-5-((1R3R)-2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamido)benzoic acid (C13) (0.100 g, 0.220 mmol) and tert-butyl-N-((tert-butoxy)carbonyl)-N-(4-amino-3,5-difluorophenyl)carbamate (C181) (0.076 g, 0.220 mmol) in ethyl acetate (2 mL) were added pyridine (0.036 mL, 0.441 mmol) and 2,4,6-tripropyl-1,3,5,2,4,6-trioxatriphosphinane 2,4,6-trioxide (T3P®) as a 50% solution in ethyl acetate (0.210 g, 0.331 mmol). The mixture was warmed to 45° C. for 48 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and concentrated under a stream of nitrogen. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography using 0-30% ethyl acetate/hexanes as eluent. Product fractions were combined and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (2 mL), and a 4 M solution of hydrogen chloride in dioxane (0.545 mL, 2.18 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. The solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. The residue was partitioned between ethyl acetate and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The phases were separated, the organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and brine and then passed through a phase separator to dry, and the solvent was concentrated. Purification by flash column chromatography using 0-30% ethyl acetate/hexanes as eluent afforded the title compound as a white solid (0.025 g, 19%).
