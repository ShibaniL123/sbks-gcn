CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/002,946, filed on May 26, 2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an intelligent massage bathing system and method for controlling the same, and in particularly related to the technical field of massage bathing equipment such as massage bathtub/hot tub, SPA pool or swimming pool. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Currently, it is widely popular for the families or leisure places in the United States and Europe to install a massage bathing equipment such as massage bathtub/hot tub, SPA pool or swimming pool. It is essential to perform an input/output analog control by a traditional SPA controller on a variety of attached devices, such as motors, air valves, heaters and so on, connected to the massage bathing equipment, peripherally. However, those conventional massage bathing systems exist a number of potential problems, namely except that the conventional massage bathing system only can be fixed by replacing the same components properly while a general periodically maintenance or an unexpected failure, the conventional massage bathing system cannot provide easy installation of extra hardware expansion kits, upgrading, or internet application, without replacing the software and hardware of the SPA controller. Therefore, a user cannot easily install the popular 3C electronic product, the video/audio entertainment equipment or other additional equipment not applicable to the massage bathing system. Moreover, the conventional massage bathing system is very expensive, and even if the user has an idea to expand the conventional massage bathing system, the idea cannot be achieved, easily. Furthermore, those devices in the conventional massage bathing system lack mutually controlling/communication function. This greatly reduces the possibility of increasing installations of the additional attached devices for users. As referring to the FIG. 1, FIG. 1 is an architectural schematic view of the first conventional massage bathing system. The first conventional massage bathing system 10 comprises a SPA controller 11 and a panel 12. The panel 12 is a passive panel. A user can operate on the SPA controller 11 through the panel 12 for controlling the attached devices peripherally connected to the massage bathing equipment. However, when the user wants to increasingly install the additional devices, there is a need to ask the manufacturer to redesign the SPA controller 11 so that the massage bathing system cannot be expanded, simply. Thus, this will invoke a lot of inconvenience in usage thereof. Additionally referring to the FIG. 2, FIG. 2 is an architectural schematic view of the second conventional massage bathing system. The difference with the previous conventional massage bathing system is that: a panel 22 of the second conventional massage bathing system 20 is a human machine interface design. The user can individually controls a single attached device connected to the massage bathing equipment by clicking a single button of the panel 22 via the SPA controller 21. Additionally referring to the FIG. 3, FIG. 3 is an architectural schematic view of the third conventional massage bathing system. The difference with the previous conventional massage bathing system is that the third conventional massage bathing system 30 further comprises a Wi-Fi module 33. The user can send a remote control command to the Wi-Fi module 33 by a remote control device (such as a mobile phone or a tablet) and individually controls the single attached device connected to the massage bathing equipment via a SPA controller 31. An operation result of the attached device can be displayed on a panel 32. However, the remote control device cannot control other devices electrically connected to the panel 32 and cannot use the functions thereof such as the internet. As the aforementioned three conventional massage bathing systems are required to modify their microprocessor of the SPA controller to add/expand the attached devices therein, the users and the manufacturers are very inconvenient. With the technological advances and the needs of users, recently, more and more users request to add 3C electronic product to the conventional massage bathing system. It's difficult to add 3C electronic product to the conventional massage bathing system, due to the conventional massage bathing system principally consists of a control panel and a SPA controller. The control panel is used by the user to input a single instruction for controlling the SPA controller. Then, the SPA controller controls action of each corresponding attached device such as a blower, an air valve, a pump or a heater according to the single instruction. That causes that the control panel cannot control those attached devices directly. Therefore, in order to add the additional functions of the SPA controller, it is necessary for the user to spend a lot of time in redesigning the SPA controller. Thus, there is a need to solve the problems of simplifying the method of expanding functions of the SPA controller and improve the mutual controls among the devices.

The movable computerized equipment 1400 can be a mobile phone, a tablet PC, a notebook or other communication equipments with communication protocols the same as the first wireless communication transceiver 1131a. Referring to FIG. 11-a, FIG. 11-a is an architectural schematic view of the intelligent massage bathing system 120 according to a third preferred embodiment of the present invention. The difference between the third preferred embodiment and the second preferred embodiment is that: an intelligent massage bathing system 120 of the third preferred embodiment utilizes a data bus network architecture 110a to connect the first master control device 1210, the second slave control device 1130, the first slave control device 1140, the massage bathing control unit 1300 and the first wireless communication transceiver 1131a. In this embodiment of the present invention, it should be noted that the massage bathing control unit 1300 and the first wireless communication transceiver 1131a can be configured as the second slave control device 1130 which is directly controlled by the first master control device 1210 through the data bus network architecture 110a. Referring to the third preferred embodiment of FIG. 11-a, the data bus network architecture 110a is an industrial bus architecture with concatenation function and multi-transmit properties, such as RS-485 architecture, but is not thereto In other embodiments, the data bus network architecture 110a also can be an industrial bus architecture with concatenation function, star connection function or cyclic connection function and multi-transmit properties, such as CAN Bus and LIN Bus. The data bus network architecture 110a comprises a first region master node and a plurality of first region slave nodes for electrically connecting with the first region master node, a portion of the at least one first slave control device 1140 and/or a portion of the second slave control devices 1130 are respectively disposed on the first region slave nodes, the first master control device is disposed on the first region master node. The massage bathing control unit 1300 configured as one of the second slave control device 1130 is disposed on one of the first region slave node. The first wireless communication transceiver 1131a (such as a Wi-Fi transceiver) belonging to the second slave control device 1130 is disposed on another first region slave node. Apart from the at least one second attached device 1120, each of the at least one first slave control device 1140 and/or the second slave control device 1130 can be directly controlled by the first master control device 1210 base on the master-slave connection through the data bus network architecture 110a. Due to the characteristics of the RS-485, a slave-slave connection is established for transmitting the messages and/or for directly controlling among the first slave control device 1140, the second slave control device 1130, the massage bathing control unit 1300 and the first wireless communication transceiver 1131a. In practice, the following examples may be established variety of the slave-slave connections. EXAMPLE 1 a slave-slave connection is used for transmitting the signals. When the first master control device 1210 assigns a default task scheduler to each of the slave control device (such as the first slave control device 1140, the second slave control device 1130 and the massage bathing control unit 1300) through the data bus network architecture, each of the slave control device operates according to the request of the default task scheduler and transmits the signals to the other related slave control devices through the data bus network architecture 110a for transmitting the signals via the slave-slave connection. For example, after the jet schedule controlling device 1111 (shown in FIG. 6) of the first slave control device 1140 turning on its control valve according to the request of the default task scheduler, the jet schedule controlling device 1111 will transmit a notification signal to the massage bathing control unit 1300 through the data bus network architecture 110a. The massage bathing control unit 1300 also controls the pump 1125 (shown in FIG. 8), according to the notification signal, processing the request of the default task scheduler, for implementing the actuation of the jet schedule controlling device 1111. It should be noted that, based on the same operation principle, the movable computerized equipment 1400 also can assigns a default task scheduler to the first wireless communication transceiver 1131a of the second slave control device 1130 through the wireless communication network architecture 110b and then the default task scheduler is transferred to each of the slave control device through the data bus network architecture 110a for implementing the directly controlling mentioned above. EXAMPLE 2 a slave-slave connection is used for controlling. When the first master control device 1210 assigns a default task scheduler to each of the slave control device (such as the massage bathing control unit 1300), the massage bathing control unit 1300 transmits a control signal to the other related slave control devices according to the request of the default task scheduler for establishing the slave-slave connection. For example, the massage bathing control unit 1300 belonging to the second slave control device 1130 transmit a control signal to the jet schedule controlling device 1111 (shown in FIG. 6) of the first slave control device 1140 for turning on its control valve according to the request of the default task scheduler through the data bus network architecture 110a. Then, the massage bathing control unit 1300 further controls the pump 1125 (shown in FIG. 8), according to the request of the default task scheduler, for implementing the actuation of the jet schedule controlling device 1111. It should be noted that, based on the same operation principle, the movable computerized equipment 1400 also can assigns a default task scheduler to the first wireless communication transceiver 1131a of the second slave control device 1130 through the wireless communication network architecture 110b and then the default task scheduler is transferred to each of the slave control device (including the massage bathing control unit 1300) through the data bus network architecture 110a. The massage bathing control unit 1300 will transmit a control signal to the other related slave control devices according to the default task scheduler for performing the controlling of the slave-slave connection. EXAMPLE 3 a slave-slave, connection is used for controlling. When the movable computerized equipment 1400 assigns a control signal to one of the slave control devices (such as the first wireless communication transceiver 1131a which belongs to the second slave control device 1130) through the wireless communication network architecture 110b, and then one of the slave control devices transmits a control signal to the other related slave control devices (such as one of the second slave control device 1130, the first slave control device 1140 and the massage bathing control unit 1300, or any combination thereof), through the data bus network architecture 110a, for performing a slave-slave connection controlling. However, the first slave control device 1140 only comprises the first attached device 1110 but excludes the other specific devices such as a sensor. If the first slave control device 1140 comprises the first attached device 1110 such as a sensor, the first slave control device 1140 needs to pass through the first master control device 1210 for performing the master-slave connection controlling. Referring to FIG. 11-b, FIG. 11-b is an architectural schematic view of the intelligent massage bathing system 130 according to a fourth preferred embodiment of the present invention.
