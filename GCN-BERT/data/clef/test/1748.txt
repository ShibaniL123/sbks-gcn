The sixth step
To a solution of Compound 53 (330mg, 0.482mmol) in dichloromethane (4 mL) were added triethylamine (0.200 mL, 1.45 mmol) and methanesulfonyl chloride (0.113mL, 1.45mmol), and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for one hour. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, and washed with water and saturated brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was dissolved in DMF (4 mL), 60% sodium hydride (57.8mg, 1.45mmol) was added thereto under ice-cooling, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 14 hours. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate, poured into a saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution, and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 54 (103g, yield 32%).
