CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/975,553, filed Apr. 4, 2014, the contents of which are entirely incorporated by reference herein. FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY The present disclosure relates generally to food cooking devices, and more specifically, to a precision temperature controlled water pump circulator appliance for cooking food in water. BACKGROUND Sous-vide is a method of cooking food sealed in airtight plastic bags in a water bath for longer than normal cooking times at an accurately regulated temperature much lower than normally used for cooking, typically around 55° C. (131° F.) to 60° C. (140° F.) for meats and higher for vegetables. Current sous-vide circulators are built with a motor that is secured within the circulator's housing. While this allows for lower cost fabrication, in the event of a pump failure, the entire circulator will cease to function, creating the need for costly repair work or replacement of the unit. Additionally, sous-vide cooking can be challenging for the novice user. Selection of correct cooking times and temperature can be difficult. Thus, there is need for improvement in the field.

The middle portion can also include a plurality of fluid level sensors communicatively coupled to the controller 12 allowing the controller 12 to adjust the fluid level. The lower portion 30 can include a pump mechanism 32 wherein the pump mechanism 32 can include a housing 34 with an opening 52 and a removable cover 38. The removable cover 38 can be coupled to the housing 34 with a sliding pane, a hinged door, a screw cap, or another suitable mechanism capable of being removed without tools. The housing 34 encompasses the impeller mechanism 36, and when the removable cover 38 is properly attached, the housing 34 and removable cover 38 encase the impeller mechanism 36. FIG. 3 illustrates the pump mechanism 32 with the removable cover 38 removably attached, thus completely encasing the impeller mechanism 36. FIG. 2 illustrates the removable cover 38 removably detached from the housing 34, thus exposing the impeller mechanism 36. The housing 34 and removable cover 38 can include a plurality of openings 50 for the intake and expulsion of the fluid as the impeller agitates the fluid. These openings 50 can be located on any surface of the housing 34 or removable cover 38 depending on the design of the impeller mechanism 36.
