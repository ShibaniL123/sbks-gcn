Example 1: Synthesis of compound 11022, N-phenyl-N-(4-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzyl)isonicotinamide
[Step 1] Synthesis of methyl 4-((phenylamino)methyl)benzoate
Aniline (1.961 mL, 21.475 mmol), methyl 4-formylbenzoate (4.230 g, 25.770 mmol) and acetic acid (0.614 mL, 10.738 mmol) were dissolved in methylene chloride (50 mL), and the solution was stirred at 0Â°C for 10 minutes. Then, sodium triacetoxyborohydride (6.828 g, 32.213 mmol) was added to the stirred solution, followed by additional stirring at room temperature for 18 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 12 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 0 % to 80 %) and concentrated to give the title compound (4.730 g, 91.3 %) as colorless oil.
