Comparative Example 3: Synthesis of racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.dinitrate
2-propanol solution (45.10 g) containing racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine (5.00 g (39.6 mmol) was charged into a 100 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and 70% nitric acid (7.27 g: 79.6 mmol) was added thereto while stirring at room temperature. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60° C., to obtain racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.dinitrate (9.51 g: 37.7 mmol, yield=95%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 248° C.
