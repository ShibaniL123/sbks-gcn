PARTIES OF JOINT RESEARCH AGREEMENT The compositions and methods disclosed herein are subject to a joint research agreement between Ignyta, Inc. and Nerviano Medical Sciences s.r.l., executed Oct. 10, 2013. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to certain substituted indazole compounds, which modulate the activity of protein kinases. The compounds of this invention are therefore useful in treating diseases caused by deregulated protein kinase activity. The present invention also provides methods for preparing these compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds, and methods of treating diseases utilizing pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The malfunctioning of protein kinases (PKs) is the hallmark of numerous diseases. A large share of the oncogenes and proto-oncogenes involved in human cancers encode for PKs. The enhanced activities of PKs are also implicated in many non-malignant diseases, such as benign prostate hyperplasia, familial adenomatosis, polyposis, neuro-fibromatosis, psoriasis, vascular smooth cell proliferation associated with atherosclerosis, pulmonary fibrosis, arthritis glomerulonephritis and post-surgical stenosis and restenosis. PKs are also implicated in inflammatory conditions and in the multiplication of viruses and parasites. PKs may also play a major role in the pathogenesis and development of neurodegenerative disorders. For a general reference to PKs malfunctioning or deregulation see, for instance, Current Opinion in Chemical Biology 1999, 3:459-465. A subset of PK is a group of membrane receptors with intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity (RPTK). Upon binding of grow factors, RPTKs become activated and phosphorylate themselves and a series of substrates in the cytoplasm. Through this mechanism, they can transduce intracellular signalings for proliferation, differentiation or other biological changes. Structural abnormalities, over-expression and activation of RTPKs are frequently observed in human tumors, suggesting that constitutive ignition of the signal transduction leading to cell proliferation can result in malignant transformation. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase receptor belonging to the insulin receptor subfamily of RTKs: the ALK gene is located on chromosome 2 and is expressed mainly in neuronal cells, especially during development. The ALK gene is involved in a balanced chromosomal translocation with the Nucleophosmin (NPM) gene on chromosome 5 in a large subset of Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphomas (ALCL). In the ALK+ALCL, as a result of the translocation, the NPM ubiquitous promoter drives an ectopic expression of the fusion protein in which the NPM moiety dimerizes and the ALK kinase domain undergoes auto-phosphorylation and becomes constitutively active. Many data from the literature have demonstrated that the NPM-ALK fusion protein has a strong oncogenic potential and its ectopic expression is responsible for cellular transformation. Moreover, the constitutive expression of human NPM-ALK in mouse T-cell lymphocytes is sufficient for the development of lymphoid neoplasia in transgenic animals with a short period of latency. ALCL is a defined disease characterized by the surface expression of the CD30 antigen (Ki-1), and accounts for 2% of adult and 13% of pediatric non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, affecting predominantly young male patients. ALK+ALCL accounts for 70% of all ALCLs and is an aggressive disease with systemic signs, and frequent extranodal involvement (bone marrow, skin, bone, soft tissues). About 15-20% of ALK-expressing ALCLs were found to bear a different chromosomal translocation, involving the cytoplasmic portion of ALK, with different N-terminal moieties, all resulting in constitutive activation of the ALK kinase domain. Moreover, cell lines established from solid tumors of ectodermal origin like melanomas, breast carcinomas, as well as neuroblastomas, glioblastomas, Ewings sarcomas, retinoblastomas, were found to express the ALK receptor. ROS1 belongs to the insulin-receptor superfamily. Like other tyrosine kinase receptor molecules, it plays a role in relaying growth signals from the environment outside the cell into the cell's nucleus. It is 1 of 2 orphan receptor tyrosine kinase family members with no known binding ligand. Genetic changes in ROS1, such as gene rearrangements, mutations, or copy number increases, create oncogenes, which can lead to cancer (Stumpfova and Janne, 2012). ROS1 was discovered in NSCLC patients in the form of a fusion protein (6 different partners for ROS1) and is found in approximately 2% of patients with NSCLC (Bergethon et al., 2012; Davies et al, 2012). Two other ROS1 gene rearrangements have been detected in a variety of other cancers, including glioblastoma multiforme, cholangiocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, gastric adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, angiosarcoma, and epitheloid hemangioendothelioma (Lee et al., 2013; Davies and Doebele, 2013; Davies, et al., 2012; Shaw et al., 2013). ROS1 gene rearrangements create fusion proteins with constitutively active kinase domains that activate downstream signaling pathways leading to oncogenic properties in cells, including uncontrolled proliferation and resistance to cell death with prolonged tumor cell survival. These pathways include Ras-ERK for cellular proliferation and the JAK-STAT and PI3K/AKT pathways, which regulate cell survival (anti-apoptosis) and proliferation. ROS1 fusion proteins may also activate the mTOR pathway, which is critical for the regulation of protein translation. Cancers that have these pathways activated tend to be more aggressive, with invasion and metastasis leading to poor survival of the patients (Davies and Doebele, 2013). Trk's are the high affinity receptor tyrosine kinases activated by a group of soluble growth factors called neurotrophins (NT). The Trk receptor family has three members—TrkA, TrkB and TrkC. Among the neurotrophins are (i) nerve growth factor (NGF) which activates TrkA, (ii) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and NT-4/5 which activate TrkB and (iii) NT3 which activates TrkC. Trk's are widely expressed in neuronal tissue and are implicated in the maintenance, signaling and survival of neuronal cells (Patapoutian, A. et al., Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 2001, 11, 272-280). NTRK1 encodes the TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase. TrkA activates the PI3K/AKT, PKC and ERK1/2 pathways which promote cell growth and survival. Inhibitors of the Trk/neurotrophin pathway have been demonstrated to be effective in numerous pre-clinical animal models of pain. For example, antagonistic NGF and TrkA antibodies (for example, RN-624) have been shown to be efficacious in inflammatory and neuropathic pain animal models and in human clinical trials (Woolf, C. J. et al. (1994) Neuroscience 62, 327-331; Zahn, P. K. et al. (2004) J. Pain 5, 157-163; McMahon, S. B. et al., (1995) Nat. Med. 1, 774-780; Ma, Q. P. and Woolf, C. J. (1997) Neuroreport 8, 807-810; Shelton, D. L. et al. (2005) Pain 116, 8-16; Delafoy, L. et al. (2003) Pain 105, 489-497; Lamb, K. et al. (2003) Neurogastroenterol. Motil. 15, 355-361; Jaggar, S. I. et al. (1999) Br. J. Anaesth. 83, 442-448). Additionally, recent literature indicates after inflammation, BDNF levels and TrkB signaling is increased in the dorsal root ganglion (Cho, L. et al. Brain Research 1997, 749, 358) and several studies have shown antibodies that decrease signaling through the BDNF/TrkB pathway inhibit neuronal hypersensitization and the associated pain (Chang-Qi, L et al. Molecular Pain 2008, 4:27). In addition, it has been shown that tumor cell send tumor invading macrophages directly stimulates TrkA located on peripheral pain fibers. Using various tumor models in both mice and rats it was demonstrated that neutralizing NGF with a monoclonal antibody inhibits cancer related pain to a degree similar or superior to the highest tolerated dose of morphine. In addition, activation of the BDNF/TrkB pathway has been implicated in numerous studies as a modulator of various types of pain including inflammatory pain (Matayoshi, S., J. Physiol. 2005, 569:685-95), neuropathic pain (Thompson, S. W., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1999, 96:7714-18) and surgical pain (Li, C.-Q. et al., Molecular Pain, 2008, 4(28), 1-11). Because TrkA and TrkB kinases may serve as a mediator of NGF driven biological responses, inhibitors of TrkA and/or other Trk kinases may provide an effective treatment for chronic pain states. Recent literature has also shown that overexpression, activation, amplification and/or mutation of Trk's are associated with many cancers including neuroblastoma (Brodeur, G. M., Nat. Rev. Cancer 2003, 3, 203-216), ovarian cancer (Davidson. B., et al., Clin. Cancer Res. 2003, 9, 2248-2259), breast cancer (Kruettgen et al, Brain Pathology 2006, 16: 304-310), prostate cancer (Dionne et al, Clin. Cancer Res. 1998, 4(8): 1887-1898), pancreatic cancer (Dang et al, Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology 2006, 21(5): 850-858), multiple myeloma (Hu et al, Cancer Genetics and Cytogenetics 2007, 178: 1-10), astrocytoma and medulloblastoma (Kruettgen et al, Brain Pathology 2006, 16: 304-310) glioma (Hansen et al, Journal of Neurochemistry 2007, 103: 259-275), melanoma (Truzzi et al, Journal of Investigative Dermatology 2008, 128(8): 2031-2040, thyroid carcinoma (Brzezianska et al, Neuroendocrinology Letters 2007, 28(3), 221-229.), lung adenocarcinoma (Perez-Pinera et al, Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry 2007, 295(1&2), 19-26), large cell neuroendocrine tumors (Marchetti et al, Human Mutation 2008, 29(5), 609-616), and colorectal cancer (Bardelli, A., Science 2003, 300, 949). In preclinical models of cancer, Trk inhibitors are efficacious in both inhibiting tumor growth and stopping tumor metastasis. In particular, non-selective small molecule inhibitors of Trk A, B and C and Trk/Fc chimeras were efficacious in both inhibiting tumor growth and stopping tumor metastasis (Nakagawara, A. (2001) Cancer Letters 169:107-114; Meyer, J. et al. (2007) Leukemia, 1-10; Pierottia, M. A. and Greco A., (2006) Cancer Letters 232:90-98; Eric Adriaenssens, E. et al. Cancer Res (2008) 68:(2) 346-351) (Truzzi et al, Journal of Investigative Dermatology 2008, 128(8): 2031-2040. Therefore, an inhibitor of the Trk family of kinases is expected to have utility in the treatment of cancer. Various gene rearrangements of the Trk gene have been implicated in human malignancies. For example, the MPRIP-NRTK1 and CD74-NRTK1 gene rearrangements have been implicated in the development of non-small cell lung cancer. Gene rearrangements TPM3-NRTK1, TGF-NTRK1 and TPR-NTRK1 have been implicated in the development of papillary thyroid cancer. The TPM3-NTRK1 gene rearrangement has been implicated in the development of colorectal cancer. NTRK1, NTRK2 or NTRK3 gene rearrangements have also been identified in glioblastoma, AML and secretory breast cancer. In 2013, Vaishnavi et al. reported novel NTRK1 fusions in 3/91 pan-negative patients with lung adenocarcinoma using NGS and FISH (Vaishnavi et al. Nat Med. 2013 November; 19(11):1469-72). In addition, inhibition of the neurotrophin/Trk pathway has been shown to be effective in treatment of pre-clinical models of inflammatory diseases. For example, inhibition of the neurotrophin/Trk pathway has been implicated in preclinical models of inflammatory lung diseases including asthma (Freund-Michel, V; Frossard, N.; Pharmacology & Therapeutics (2008), 117(1), 52-76), interstitial cystitis (Hu Vivian Y; et. al. The Journal of Urology (2005), 173(3), 1016-21), inflammatory bowel diseases including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease (Di Mola, F. F, et. al., Gut (2000), 46(5), 670-678) and inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis (Dou, Y.-C.; et. al. Archives of Dermatological Research (2006), 298(1), 31-37), eczema and psoriasis (Raychaudhuri, S. P.; et. al. Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2004), 122(3), 812-819). The neurotrophin/Trk pathway, particularly BDNF/TrkB, has also been implicated in the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease (Sohrabji, Farida; Lewis, Danielle K. Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology (2006), 27(4), 404-414). Modulation of the neutrophin/Trk pathway may have utility in treatment of these and related diseases. The TrkA receptor is also thought to be critical to the disease process in the infection of the parasitic infection of Typanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease) in human hosts (de Melo-Jorge, M. et al. Cell Host & Microbe (2007), 1(4), 251-261). Thus, TrkA inhibition may have utility in treating Chagas disease and related protozoan infections. Trk inhibitors may also find use in treating disease related to an imbalance of the regulation of bone remodeling, such as osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and bone metastases. Bone metastases are a frequent complication of cancer, occurring in up to 70 percent of patients with advanced breast or prostate cancer (1) and in approximately 15 to 30 percent of patients with carcinoma of the lung, colon, stomach, bladder, uterus, rectum, thyroid, or kidney. Osteolytic metastases can cause severe pain, pathologic fractures, life-threatening hypercalcemia, spinal cord compression, and other nerve-compression syndromes. For these reasons, bone metastasis is a serious and costly complication of cancer. Therefore, agents that can induce apoptosis of proliferating osteoblasts would be highly advantageous. Expression of TrkA and TrkC receptors has been observed in the bone forming area in mouse models of bone fracture (K. Asaumi, et al., Bone (2000) 26(6) 625-633). In addition, localization of NGF was observed in almost all bone forming cells (K. Asaumi, et al.). Recently, it was demonstrated that a pan-Trk inhibitor inhibits the tyrosine signaling activated by neurotrophins binding to all three of the Trk receptors in human hFOB osteoblasts (J. Pinski, et al., (2002) 62, 986-989). These data support the rationale for the use of Trk inhibitors for the treatment of bone remodeling diseases, such as bone metastases in cancer patients. In conclusion, interfering with ALK or ROS1 signaling likely represents a specific and effective way to block tumor cell proliferation in ALCL and possibly other indications. The insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R, IGF1R) is also a member of the insulin receptor subfamily of RTKs. In addition, interfering with TrkA, TrkB and/or TrkC signaling, or a combination thereof, represents a specific and effective way to block tumor cell proliferation in various cancers, including, but not limited to, non-small cell lung cancer, papillary thyroid cancer, neuroblastoma, pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer. There exist several lines of evidence suggesting that IGF-1R signaling can contribute to tumorigenesis, and that interfering with IGF-1R function represents a valid therapeutic option in cancer. For an overview of IGFs and IGF-1R signaling, physiological function, and detailed description of the evidence supporting involvement of this system in human cancer that is summarized above, as well as in other pathologies, the reader is directed to the many reviews on the subject and references contained therein, for example Baserga R. et al, Biochim Biophys Acta vol. 1332, pages F105-F126, 1997; Khandwala H.

Accordingly, in some embodiments, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, optionally, at least one additional medicinal or pharmaceutical agent. In some embodiments, the at least one additional medicinal or pharmaceutical agent is an anti-cancer agent as described below. The pharmaceutically acceptable carrier may comprise a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient. Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert diluents or fillers, water and various organic solvents (such as hydrates and solvates). The pharmaceutical compositions may, if desired, contain additional ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like. Thus for oral administration, tablets containing various excipients, such as citric acid may be employed together with various disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates and with binding agents such as sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Non-limiting examples of materials, therefore, include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active compound therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matters or dyes and, if desired, emulsifying agents or suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, or combinations thereof. The pharmaceutical composition may, for example, be in a form suitable for oral administration as a tablet, capsule, pill, powder, sustained release formulations, solution suspension, for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository. Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of active compounds in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous propylene glycol or dextrose solutions. Such dosage forms may be suitably buffered, if desired. The pharmaceutical composition may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of precise dosages. In some embodiments, the composition comprises a therapeutically effective amount of a compound as disclosed herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compounds of the present invention may be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions as described below in any pharmaceutical form recognizable to the skilled artisan as being suitable. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention comprise a therapeutically effective amount of at least one compound disclosed herein and an inert, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. To treat or prevent diseases or conditions mediated by ALK, ROS1, TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC, or a combination thereof, a pharmaceutical composition of the invention is administered in a suitable formulation prepared by combining a therapeutically effective amount (i.e., a ALK, ROS1, TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC modulating, regulating, or inhibiting amount effective to achieve therapeutic efficacy) of at least one compound of the present invention (as an active ingredient) with one or more pharmaceutically suitable carriers, which may be selected, for example, from diluents, excipients and auxiliaries that facilitate processing of the active compounds into the final pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical carriers employed may be either solid or liquid. Exemplary solid carriers are lactose, sucrose, talc, gelatin, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid and the like. Exemplary liquid carriers are syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, water and the like. Similarly, the inventive compositions may include time-delay or time-release material known in the art, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax, ethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylmethacrylate or the like. Further additives or excipients may be added to achieve the desired formulation properties. For example, a bioavailability enhancer, such as Labrasol, Gelucire or the like, or formulator, such as CMC (carboxy-methylcellulose), PG (propyleneglycol), or PEG (polyethyleneglycol), may be added. Gelucire®, a semi-solid vehicle that protects active ingredients from light, moisture and oxidation, may be added, e.g., when preparing a capsule formulation. If a solid carrier is used, the preparation can be tableted, placed in a hard gelatin capsule in powder or pellet form, or formed into a troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier may vary, but generally will be from about 25 mg to about 1 g. If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation may be in the form of syrup, emulsion, soft gelatin capsule, sterile injectable solution or suspension in an ampoule or vial or non-aqueous liquid suspension. If a semi-solid carrier is used, the preparation may be in the form of hard and soft gelatin capsule formulations. The inventive compositions are prepared in unit-dosage form appropriate for the mode of administration, e.g. parenteral or oral administration. To obtain a stable water-soluble dose form, a salt of a compound of the present invention may be dissolved in an aqueous solution of an organic or inorganic acid, such as a 0.3 M solution of succinic acid or citric acid. If a soluble salt form is not available, the agent may be dissolved in a suitable co-solvent or combinations of co-solvents. Examples of suitable co-solvents include alcohol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol 300, polysorbate 80, glycerin and the like in concentrations ranging from 0 to 60% of the total volume. In an exemplary embodiment, a compound of the present invention is dissolved in DMSO and diluted with water. The composition may also be in the form of a solution of a salt form of the active ingredient in an appropriate aqueous vehicle such as water or isotonic saline or dextrose solution. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration selected. For injection, the agents of the compounds of the present invention may be formulated into aqueous solutions, preferably in physiologically compatible buffers such as Hanks solution, Ringer's solution, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art. For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated by combining the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a subject to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained using a solid excipient in admixture with the active ingredient (agent), optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients include: fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; and cellulose preparations, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as crosslinked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, Carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active agents. Pharmaceutical preparations that can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with fillers such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate, and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active agents may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. For administration intranasally or by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present invention may be conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebuliser, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator and the like may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. The compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit-dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active agents may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances that increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents that increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. In addition to the formulations described above, the compounds of the present invention may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long-acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion-exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt. A pharmaceutical carrier for hydrophobic compounds is a co-solvent system comprising benzyl alcohol, a non-polar surfactant, a water-miscible organic polymer, and an aqueous phase. The co-solvent system may be a VPD co-solvent system. VPD is a solution of 3% w/v benzyl alcohol, 8% w/v of the non-polar surfactant polysorbate 80, and 65% w/v polyethylene glycol 300, made up to volume in absolute ethanol. The VPD co-solvent system (VPD: 5 W) contains VPD diluted 1:1 with a 5% dextrose in water solution. This co-solvent system dissolves hydrophobic compounds well, and itself produces low toxicity upon systemic administration. The proportions of a co-solvent system may be suitably varied without destroying its solubility and toxicity characteristics. Furthermore, the identity of the co-solvent components may be varied: for example, other low-toxicity non-polar surfactants may be used instead of polysorbate 80; the fraction size of polyethylene glycol may be varied; other biocompatible polymers may replace polyethylene glycol, e.g. polyvinyl pyrrolidone; and other sugars or polysaccharides may be substituted for dextrose. Alternatively, other delivery systems for hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds may be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are known examples of delivery vehicles or carriers for hydrophobic drugs. Certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide also may be employed, although usually at the cost of greater toxicity due to the toxic nature of DMSO. Additionally, the compounds may be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the therapeutic agent. Various sustained-release materials have been established and are known by those skilled in the art. Sustained-release capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the compounds for a few weeks up to over 100 days. Depending on the chemical nature and the biological stability of the therapeutic reagent, additional strategies for protein stabilization may be employed. The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid- or gel-phase carriers or excipients. These carriers and excipients may provide marked improvement in the bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs. Examples of such carriers or excipients include calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols. Furthermore, additives or excipients such as Gelucire®, Capryol®, Labrafil®, Labrasol®, Lauroglycol®, Plurol®, Peceol®, Transcutol® and the like may be used. Further, the pharmaceutical composition may be incorporated into a skin patch for delivery of the drug directly onto the skin. It will be appreciated that the actual dosages of the agents of this invention will vary according to the particular agent being used, the particular composition formulated, the mode of administration, and the particular site, host, and disease being treated. Those skilled in the art using conventional dosage-determination tests in view of the experimental data for a given compound may ascertain optimal dosages for a given set of conditions. For oral administration, an exemplary daily dose generally employed will be from about 0.001 to about 1000 mg/kg of body weight, with courses of treatment repeated at appropriate intervals.

Partial response lasted for 4 cycles before progressive disease. Neuroblastoma (NB) (N=1). A 22 year old female with metastatic NB, ALK mutation, s/p 4 cycles of chemotherapy, achieved partial response after 12 cycles of N-[5-(3,5-difluorobenzyl)-1H-indazol-3-yl]-4-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-ylamino)benzamide (started at 200 mg/m2/day and had subsequent dose escalations to 1200 mg/m2/day, Schedule A). Partial response is ongoing (the patient is currently in cycle 21). A total of 25 patients were evaluated across 3 different dosing schedules in this trial of N-[5-(3,5-difluorobenzyl)-1H-indazol-3-yl]-4-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-ylamino)benzamide. There was a complete response in a patient with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a ROS1 molecular alteration. There were 5 partial responses (3 of these durable >9 cycles) across multiple tumor types (NSCLC, CRC and NB) in patients with TrkA, ROS1, and ALK molecular alterations; moreover, there were 2 patients with prolonged stable disease (11+ cycles) with NSCLC and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. N-[5-(3,5-difluorobenzyl)-1H-indazol-3-yl]-4-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-ylamino)benzamide was well tolerated in all dosing schedules tested, including intermittent and daily continuous administration. Most common AEs (mainly grade 1-2) considered possibly drug-related were nausea, paresthesia, vomiting, diarrhea, asthenia, myalgia, arthralgia, and dysgeusia. Only 1 possibly drug-related Grade >3 AE was observed: asthenia (Grade 3 in one patient). No drug limiting toxicities, study discontinuations due to adverse events, or drug-related serious adverse events were reported. Schedule A was terminated at 1600 mg/m2/day due to a plateau of N-[5-(3,5-difluorobenzyl)-1H-indazol-3-yl]-4-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-ylamino)benzamide exposure and the data were presented previously. N-[5-(3,5-difluorobenzyl)-1H-indazol-3-yl]-4-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-ylamino)benzamide was well tolerated in all dosing schedules tested (both on an intermittent and daily continuous basis). Most AEs <Grade 2. Only 1 possibly drug-related Grade >3 AE has been observed: asthenia (1200 mg/m2, Schedule A), that subsided with dose reduction to 800 mg/m2/day. No DLTs, study discontinuations due to AEs, or drug-related SAEs were reported in any dosing schedule. Exposure to N-[5-(3,5-difluorobenzyl)-1H-indazol-3-yl]-4-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-2-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-ylamino)benzamide increased in an approximate dose proportional manner up to doses of 800 mg/m2 with mean plasma half-life of 17 to 44 hours. Responders tended to have higher exposure than non-responders throughout the entire dosing cycle in Schedule A.
