Step 1
Biphenyl-3,3'-dicarbaldehyde (8)
To a solution of 3-bromobenzaldehyde (6 g, 34.654 mmol) and 3-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzaldehyde (5.1 g, 34.654 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (40 mL) and water (10 mL) was added K2CO3 (9.39 g, 68.108 mmol) and the reaction mixture was purged with argon for 10 min, prior to the addition of Pd(PPh3)4(3.9 g, 3.465 mmol) and again degassed for 10 min. The reaction mixture was stirred at 85° C. for 16 h. The reaction mixture was poured into ice-cold water and extracted with ethyl acetate (2×1 L). The combined organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated to give the crude product, which was purified on a silica gel column, eluting with ethyl acetate in pet ether (0.20%) to get biphenyl-3,3'-dicarbaldehyde 8 (6 g, 88%) as an off-white solid, [C14H10O2];
