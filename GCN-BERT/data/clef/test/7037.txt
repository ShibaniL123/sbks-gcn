Step 2
To a solution of Compound 15i (2.1g, 4.95mmol) in ethanol (21mL) and water (4 mL) were added iron powder (1.38 g, 24.7 mmol) and ammonium chloride (2.65 g, 49.5 mmol), and the mixture was stirred for 50 minutes at 90Â°C. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and filtered through celite with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and ethyl acetate. The filtrate was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by DIOL column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to yield Compound 16i as a brown solid (1.7 g, 87%).
