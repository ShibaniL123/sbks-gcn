The content of each such related application is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an ink composition and a two-pack curing ink composition set, that cure by light such as ultraviolet rays. More particularly, it relates to an ink composition and a two-pack curing ink composition set, having excellent film strength and additionally excellent curability. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a recording method and recorded matter, using the ink composition or the two-pack curing ink composition set. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Ink jet recording method is a printing method which conducts printing by flying small droplets of an ink composition and attaching the same to a recording medium such as papers. This ink jet recording method has the characteristic that high resolution and high definition image can be printed at high speed. In general, an ink composition used in an ink jet recording method comprises an aqueous solvent as a main component, and further contains a coloring component and a wetting agent such as glycerin for the purpose of preventing clogging. On the other hand, where printing is conducted on recording media such as papers and clothes in which an aqueous ink composition is hard to penetrate, or materials such as metals and plastics, in which an aqueous ink composition does not penetrate, such as plates or films produced from phenol, melamine, vinyl chloride, acryl or polycarbonate, an ink composition is required to contain a component that a coloring material can stably be fixed to a recording medium. To such a demand, a light curing ink jet ink comprising a coloring material, a light curing agent (racially polymerizable compound) and (photoradical) polymerization initiator is disclosed (for example, see Patent Document 1). It is described that this ink can prevent ink from bleeding into a recording medium, and can improve image quality. Furthermore, to attempt improvement of film strength, chemical resistance, dispersion stability and the like, a light curing ink jet recording ink composition containing a coloring material, a urethane oligomer, a monomer having trifunctional or more reactive group, and an aqueous solvent is developed (see Patent Document 2). Moreover, for the purpose of preventing separation of a pigment as a coloring material, improving scratch resistance and printing reliability, preventing bleeding after printing and enhancing drying properties of an ink, an ink jet recording ink comprising two components of an ink composition containing a coloring material, and a reaction liquid containing a polymerization initiator, and an ink jet recording method which prints on a recording medium using those two components are disclosed (for example, see Patent Document 3). An ink jet recording ink comprising such two components is that a photopolymerization initiator and a light curing resin is contained in either of the ink composition or the reaction liquid. Thus, by separating into two components of the ink composition and the reaction liquid, dark reaction is suppressed, making it possible to store the ink composition and the reaction liquid over a long period of time and to obtain prints having excellent light resistance and heat resistance.

No. 5,623,001 Patent Document 2: JP-A-2000-336295 Patent Document 3: JP-A-8-218018 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION However, an ultraviolet curing ink composition using an aqueous solvent is that the aqueous medium does not contribute to curing. As a result, water bleeds upon curing, and due to the influence, a cured product does not have smooth edges, lacking in sharpness. The present invention relates to an ultraviolet curing ink jet ink composition, which overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art, have excellent film strength, chemical resistance and dispersion stability and additionally excellent curability, and can form a clear image. Furthermore, the present invention relates to a recording method, using such ink composition. As a result of the present inventors having made extensive and intensive investigations, the above objects are achieved by employing the following constitutions, and the present invention has been made. The ultraviolet curing ink jet ink composition of the present invention contains at least a polymerizable compound and a photopolymerization initiator, and is free from an aqueous solvent. The polymerizable compound comprises at least a urethane oligomer, the photopolyerization initiator comprises an acylphosphineoxide and α-hydroketone. Owing to these features, an ink composition having excellent film strength and additionally excellent curability and capable of forming a clear image can be provided. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The ink composition of the present invention is described in detail below. The ink composition of the present invention is an ink composition which contains at least a polymerizable compound, a photopolymerization initiator and a coloring material, and does not contain an aqueous solvent, wherein at least a urethane oligomer is contained as the polymerizable compound. The urethane oligomer in the present invention means a urethane oligomer having at least one urethane bond and radically polymerizable unsaturated double bond in the molecule. The term “oligomer” as used in the present invention means a molecule of a medium size having a structure constituted by small number repetitions, generally from about 2 to 20, of units substantially or conceptually obtained from a molecule having a relative molecular mass (synonymous with a molecular weight). The urethane oligomer in the present invention has at least one acryloyl group as a functional group, and therefore has the properties of inducing a polymerization reaction with a monomer or the like by ultraviolet irradiation or the like, thereby crosslinking and polymerizing. The urethane oligomer used in the present invention includes a oligomer generated by an addition reaction of a polyol, a polyisocyanate and a polyhydroxy compound, and additionally includes a polyester type urethane acrylate, a polyether type urethane acrylate, a polybutadiene type urethane acrylate and a polyol type urethane acrylate, depending on a molecular structure constituting a skeleton. The urethane oligomer used in the present invention has a molecular weight in a range of from about 500 to 20,000, and preferably from about 500 to 10,000. The content of the urethane oligomer in the ink composition according to the present invention is in a range of from about 1 to 50% by weight, and preferably from about 3 to 30% by weight. The ink composition according to the present invention preferably contains a photopolymerization initiator for radical polymerization or cationic polymerization as a photopolymerization initiator. The photopolymerization initiator in the present invention is a compound which induces chemical change through action of light or interaction with electron excitation state of a sensitizing dye, thereby generating at least one of radical, acid and base. The photopolymerization initiator can be used by appropriately selecting from compounds having sensitivity to active light irradiated, such as ultraviolet ray of 400 to 200 nm, far ultraviolet ray, g ray h ray, i ray, KrF excimer laser light, ArF excimer light, electron beam, X ray, molecular beam or ion beam.

According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, those pigments are dispersed in a monomer medium with a dispersing agent or a surfactant to obtain a pigment dispersion, which may be used as an ink composition. Dispersing agents commonly used to prepare a pigment dispersion, for example, a polymer dispersing agent, can be used as the preferred dispersing agent. Where the ink composition contains a coloring material, the ink composition containing the coloring material may comprise plural ink compositions of respective colors. For example, where in addition to four fundamental colors of yellow, magenta, cyan and black, dark color and/or light color of the same color series are to be added for the respective color, examples thereof include light magenta (light color) and red (dark color) for magenta, light cyan (light color) and blue (dark color) for cyan, and gray and light black (light colors) and mat black (dark color) for black.

When the ink composition of the present invention is used in an ink jet recording method, it is preferred in use that the ink composition has viscosity of 10 mPa·s or less at 25° C. When the ink composition of the present invention is a light curing ink composition, curing reaction is conducted by light irradiation. When the ink composition of the present invention is an ultraviolet curing ink composition, the ink composition is discharged on a recording medium, and is then irradiated with ultraviolet rays. When the two-pack curing ink composition set of the present invention is a light curing ink composition set, curing reaction is conducted by mixing an ink composition containing a coloring material and a reaction liquid containing a photopolymerization initiator, and then irradiating with light (preferably ultraviolet rays). Mixing may be conducted before or after printing so long as it is before curing reaction. Specifically, the mixing and printing may have the embodiment that the ink composition containing a coloring material and the reaction liquid containing a photopolymerization initiator are deposited on a recording medium at the same position, or may have the embodiment that the ink composition containing a coloring material and the reaction liquid containing a photopolymerization initiator are mixed, and then deposited on a recording medium. The two-pack curing ink composition set of the present invention does not have any particular limitation on the formation of the ink composition containing a coloring material and the reaction liquid containing a photopolymerization initiator so long as, in the state of mixing the ink composition containing a coloring material and the reaction liquid containing a photopolymerization initiator, such a mixture is the ink composition according to the present invention as described above (that is, an ink composition that contains at least a polymerizable compound, a photopolymerization initiator and a coloring material, and that does not contain an aqueous solvent, wherein at least a urethane oligomer is contained as the polymerizable compound). Irradiation light source is not particularly limited, but the irradiation light source is preferably light having a wavelength of from 350 to 450 nm. Irradiation amount of ultraviolet rays is in a range of from 10 to 20,000 mJ/cm2, and preferably from 50 to 15,000 mJ/cm2. Ultraviolet irradiation amount in a range of such a degree enables curing reaction to sufficiently conduct. Ultraviolet irradiation is conducted with lamps, and examples of the lamp include metal halide lamp, xenon lamp, carbon arc lamp, chemical lamp, low pressure mercury lamp and high pressure mercury lamp. For example, commercially available lamps such as H lamp, D lamp and V lamp, products of Fusion System, can be used.
