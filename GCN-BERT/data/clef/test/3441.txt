FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention is in the field of biotechnology, in particular, this pertains to increasing oil content of seeds that already have elevated oil content due to expression of DGAT genes. BACKGROUND Plant oil is a valuable renewable resource. Plant lipids have a variety of industrial and nutritional uses and are central to plant membrane function and climatic adaptation. Besides the nutritional uses, vegetable oils are gaining increasing interest as substitutes for petroleum-derived materials in fuels, lubricants, and specialty chemicals, especially as crude oil supplies decline. Oilseeds provide a unique platform for the production of high-value fatty acids that can replace non- sustainable petroleum products. (Cahoon et al. (2007) Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 10:236-244). Methods to increase the content and to improve and alter the composition of plant oils are therefore desired. Triacylglycerol (TAG) is the primary component of vegetable oil in plants; it is used by the seed as a stored form of energy to be used during seed germination. There are limitations to using conventional plant breeding to alter fatty acid composition and content. Molecular and cellular biology techniques offer the potential for overcoming some of the limitations of the conventional breeding approach. Some of the particularly useful technologies are seed-specific expression of foreign genes in transgenic plants (Goldberg et al . (1989) Cell 56:149-160), and the use of antisense RNA to inhibit plant target genes in a dominant and tissue-specific manner (van der Krol et al. (1988) Gene 72:45-50]. Other advances include the transfer of foreign genes into elite commercial varieties of commercial oilseed crops, such as soybean (Chee et al. (1989) Plant Physiol. 91 :1212-1218; Christou et al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 86:7500-7504; Hinchee et al. (1988) Bio/Technology 6:915-922; EPO publication 0 301 749 A2], rapeseed (De Block et al . (1989) Plant Physiol. 91 :694-701 ), and sunflower (Everett et al. (1987) Bio/Technology 5:1201 -1204), and the use of genes as restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers in a breeding program, which makes introgression of recessive traits into elite lines rapid and less expensive (Tanksley et al. (1989) Bio/Technology 7:257-264). However, application of each of these technologies requires identification and isolation of commercially-important genes. Carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1 .1 ) is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme that catalyzes the reverse hydration of CO2 to HCO3 . The widespread abundance of CA isoforms in plants, animal, and microorganisms suggest that this enzyme has many diverse roles in biological processes (Chau et al. Plant Phys. 2002:128, 1417- 1427). SUMMARY The present invention relates to the use of plastidic carbonic anhydrase to further increase oil content in seeds that already show increased oil contents due to expression of DGAT and /or ODP1 genes. It is being shown that plastidic carbonic anhydrase genes show increased expression in developing seeds of transgenic plants with increased seed oil content due to expression of the AP2 domain transcription factor, such as but not limited to ZM-ODP1 or due to the expression DGAT. Co-expression in soybean somatic embryos of genes from GM-CA and GM- CA2 or one gene for Arabidopsis (Ath-BCA5) with YL-DGAT2, increases oil content to levels that are not achieved with YL-DGAT2 alone. In one embodiment, a recombinant DNA construct comprising at least one first heterologous polynucleotide encoding a plastidic carbonic anhydrase polypeptide, wherein said polynucleotide is operably linked to at least one regulatory sequence and at least one second heterologous polynucleotide encoding a DGAT polypeptide operably linked to at least one regulatory sequence, wherein expression of said recombinant DNA construct in a transgenic soybean seed results in an increased oil content in a transgenic soybean seed, when compared to a control seed that expresses said second polypeptide but does not express said first polypeptide. The second heterologous polynucleotide may encode an ODP1 , a Led or FUSCA3 polypeptide. Furthermore, the recombinant construct may further comprise a third polynucleotide comprising a construct downregulating galactinol synthase activity, wherein the first heterologous polynucleotide, the second heterologous polynucleotide and the galactinol synthase construct can be in the same construct or in separate constructs. In one embodiment, the recombinant construct may further comprise a third polynucleotide comprising a construct downregulating PGM activity.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The disclosure of each reference set forth herein is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. As used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms "a", "an", and "the" include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a plant" includes a plurality of such plants; reference to "a cell" includes one or more cells and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth. In the context of this disclosure, a number of terms and abbreviations are used. The following definitions are provided. The term "percentage points" (pp) refers to the arithmetic difference of two percentages, e.g. [transgenic value (%) - control value (%)] = percentage points. For example, a transgenic seed may contain 20% by weight of a component and the corresponding control seed may contain 15% by weight of that component. The difference in the component between the control seed and the transgenic seed would be expressed as 5 percentage points. The term "relative change", "percent change", "percent increase", or "percent decrease" refers to a change expressed as a fraction of the control value , e.g. {[transgenic value(%) - control value (%)]/control value (%)} x 100% = percent change. For example, a transgenic seed may contain 20% by weight of a component and the corresponding control seed may contain 15% by weight of that component. The difference in the component of the transgenic from the control would be expressed as a 33.3% relative change, percent change or percent increase. The terms "monocot" and "monocotyledonous plant" are used interchangeably herein. A monocot of the current invention includes the Gramineae. The terms "dicot" and "dicotyledonous plant" are used interchangeably herein. A dicot of the current invention includes the following families: Brassicaceae, Leguminosae, and Solanaceae. The terms "full complement" and "full-length complement" are used interchangeably herein, and refer to a complement of a given nucleotide sequence, wherein the complement and the nucleotide sequence consist of the same number of nucleotides and are 100% complementary. The control is a seed, plant, plant part or product, comparable to the transgenic seed, plant, plant part or product which, unless specified to the contrary, lacks the transgenes or is obtained from material lacking the transgenes. In some embodiments the control is a seed, plant, plant part, or product, comparable to the transgenic seed, plant, plant part , or product which, lacks the transgene or recombinant construct comprising the heterologous polynucleotide encoding the plastidic carbonic anhydrase polypeptide. In some embodiment the control is a recombinant construct, comparable to the transgenic or recombinant construct , which lacks the polynucleotide encoding plastidic carbonic anhydrase polypeptide. In some embodiments the control seed is a seed that expresses the second polypeptide; e.g. DGAT, OPD1 or Led but does not express the first polypeptide; e.g. carbonic anhydrase. In certain embodiments, the control lacks constructs which downregulate specified activities, but which includes the DGAT, OPD1 or Led encoding polynucleotide. In certain embodiments, the control lacks both the constructs downregulating specified activities and the DGAT, OPD1 or Led encoding polynucleotide. In certain embodiments, the control is a non-transgenic, null segregant soybean plant, plant part or seed. _"Non-transgenic, null segregant soybean, control null segregant " refers to a control near isogenic plant, plant part or seed that lacks the transgene (unless otherwise stated), and/or a control parental plant used in the transformation process to obtain the transgenic event. Null segregants can be plants, plant parts or seed that do not contain the transgenic trait due to normal genetic segregation during propagation of the heterozygous transgenic plants. The term "or combinations thereof as used herein refers to all permutations and combinations of the listed items preceding the term. For example, "A, B, C, or combinations thereof is intended to include at least one of: A, B, C, AB, AC, BC, or ABC, and if order is important in a particular context, also BA, CA, CB, CBA, BCA, ACB, BAC, or CAB. Continuing with this example, expressly included are combinations that contain repeats of one or more item or term, such as BB, AAA, AB, BBC, AAABCCCC, CBBAAA, CABABB, and so forth. The skilled artisan will understand that typically there is no limit on the number of items or terms in any combination, unless otherwise apparent from the context. "Transgenic" refers to any cell, cell line, callus, tissue, plant part or plant, the genome of which has been altered by the presence of a heterologous nucleic acid, such as a recombinant DNA construct, including those initial transgenic events as well as those created by sexual crosses or asexual propagation from the initial transgenic event. The term "transgenic" as used herein does not encompass the alteration of the genome (chromosomal or extra-chromosomal) by conventional plant breeding methods or by naturally occurring events such as random cross- fertilization, non-recombinant viral infection, non-recombinant bacterial transformation, non-recombinant transposition, or spontaneous mutation. "Genome" as it applies to plant cells encompasses not only chromosomal DNA found within the nucleus, but organelle DNA found within subcellular components (e.g., mitochondrial, plastid) of the cell. "Plant" includes reference to whole plants, plant organs, plant tissues, plant propagules, seeds and plant cells and progeny of same. Plant cells include, without limitation, cells from seeds, suspension cultures, embryos, meristematic regions, callus tissue, leaves, roots, shoots, gametophytes, sporophytes, pollen, and microspores. "Propagule" includes all products of meiosis and mitosis able to propagate a new plant, including but not limited to, seeds, spores and parts of a plant that serve as a means of vegetative reproduction, such as corms, tubers, offsets, or runners. Propagule also includes grafts where one portion of a plant is grafted to another portion of a different plant (even one of a different species) to create a living organism. Propagule also includes all plants and seeds produced by cloning or by bringing together meiotic products, or allowing meiotic products to come together to form an embryo or fertilized egg (naturally or with human intervention). "Transgenic plant" includes reference to a plant which comprises within its genome a heterologous polynucleotide. For example, the heterologous polynucleotide is stably integrated within the genome such that the polynucleotide is passed on to successive generations. The heterologous polynucleotide may be integrated into the genome alone or as part of a recombinant DNA construct. The commercial development of genetically improved germplasm has also advanced to the stage of introducing multiple traits into crop plants, often referred to as a gene stacking approach. In this approach, multiple genes conferring different characteristics of interest can be introduced into a plant. Gene stacking can be accomplished by many means including but not limited to co-transformation, retransformation, and crossing lines with different transgenes. "Transgenic plant" also includes reference to plants which comprise more than one heterologous polynucleotide within their genome. Each heterologous polynucleotide may confer a different trait to the transgenic plant. "Heterologous" with respect to sequence means a sequence that originates from a foreign species, or, if from the same species, is substantially modified from its native form in composition and/or genomic locus by deliberate human intervention. "Progeny" comprises any subsequent generation of a plant. "Polynucleotide", "nucleic acid sequence", "nucleotide sequence", or "nucleic acid fragment" are used interchangeably and is a polymer of RNA or DNA that is single- or double-stranded, optionally containing synthetic, non-natural or altered nucleotide bases. Nucleotides (usually found in their 5'-monophosphate form) are referred to by their single letter designation as follows: "A" for adenylate or deoxyadenylate (for RNA or DNA, respectively), "C" for cytidylate or deoxycytidylate, "G" for guanylate or deoxyguanylate, "U" for uridylate, "T" for deoxythymidylate, "R" for purines (A or G), "Y" for pyrimidines (C or T), "K" for G or T, "H" for A or C or T, "I" for inosine, and "N" for any nucleotide. "Polypeptide", "peptide", "amino acid sequence" and "protein" are used interchangeably herein to refer to a polymer of amino acid residues. The terms apply to amino acid polymers in which one or more amino acid residue is an artificial chemical analogue of a corresponding naturally occurring amino acid, as well as to naturally occurring amino acid polymers. The terms "polypeptide", "peptide", "amino acid sequence", and "protein" are also inclusive of modifications including, but not limited to, glycosylation, lipid attachment, sulfation, gamma-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues, hydroxylation and ADP-ribosylation. "Messenger RNA (mRNA)" refers to the RNA that is without introns and that can be translated into protein by the cell. "cDNA" refers to a DNA that is complementary to and synthesized from an mRNA template using the enzyme reverse transcriptase. The cDNA can be single- stranded or converted into the double-stranded form using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. "Coding region" refers to the portion of a messenger RNA (or the corresponding portion of another nucleic acid molecule such as a DNA molecule) which encodes a protein or polypeptide. "Non-coding region" refers to all portions of a messenger RNA or other nucleic acid molecule that are not a coding region, including but not limited to, for example, the promoter region, 5' untranslated region ("UTR"), 3' UTR, intron and terminator. The terms "coding region" and "coding sequence" are used interchangeably herein. The terms "non-coding region" and "non-coding sequence" are used interchangeably herein. An "Expressed Sequence Tag" ("EST") is a DNA sequence derived from a cDNA library and therefore is a sequence which has been transcribed. An EST is typically obtained by a single sequencing pass of a cDNA insert. "Mature" protein refers to a post-translationally processed polypeptide; i.e., one from which any pre- or pro-peptides present in the primary translation product has been removed. "Precursor" protein refers to the primary product of translation of mRNA; i.e., with pre- and pro-peptides still present. Pre- and pro-peptides may be and are not limited to intracellular localization signals. "Isolated" refers to materials, such as nucleic acid molecules and/or proteins, which are substantially free or otherwise removed from components that normally accompany or interact with the materials in a naturally occurring environment. Isolated polynucleotides may be purified from a host cell in which they naturally occur. Conventional nucleic acid purification methods known to skilled artisans may be used to obtain isolated polynucleotides. The term also embraces recombinant polynucleotides and chemically synthesized polynucleotides. The terms "full complement" and "full-length complement" are used interchangeably herein, and refer to a complement of a given nucleotide sequence, wherein the complement and the nucleotide sequence consist of the same number of nucleotides and are 100% complementary. "Recombinant" refers to an artificial combination of two otherwise separated segments of sequence, e.g., by chemical synthesis or by the manipulation of isolated segments of nucleic acids by genetic engineering techniques. "Recombinant" also includes reference to a cell or vector, that has been modified by the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid or a cell derived from a cell so modified, but does not encompass the alteration of the cell or vector by naturally occurring events (e.g., spontaneous mutation, natural transformation/transduction/transposition) such as those occurring without deliberate human intervention. The terms "recombinant construct", "expression construct", "chimeric construct", "construct", and "recombinant DNA construct" are used interchangeably herein. A recombinant construct comprises an artificial combination of nucleic acid fragments, e.g., regulatory and coding sequences that are not found together in nature. For example, a chimeric construct may comprise regulatory sequences and coding sequences that are derived from different sources, or regulatory sequences and coding sequences derived from the same source, but arranged in a manner different than that found in nature. Such a construct may be used by itself or may be used in conjunction with a vector. This construct may comprise any combination of deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides, and/or modified nucleotides. The construct may be transcribed to form an RNA, wherein the RNA may be capable of forming a double-stranded RNA and/or hairpin structure. This construct may be expressed in the cell, or isolated or synthetically produced. The construct may further comprise a promoter, or other sequences which facilitate manipulation or expression of the construct. The term "conserved domain" or "motif means a set of amino acids conserved at specific positions along an aligned sequence of evolutionarily related proteins. While amino acids at other positions can vary between homologous proteins, amino acids that are highly conserved at specific positions indicate amino acids that are essential in the structure, the stability, or the activity of a protein. Because they are identified by their high degree of conservation in aligned sequences of a family of protein homologues, they can be used as identifiers, or "signatures", to determine if a protein with a newly determined sequence belongs to a previously identified protein family. The terms "homology", "homologous", "substantially similar" and "corresponding substantially" are used interchangeably herein. They refer to nucleic acid fragments wherein changes in one or more nucleotide bases do not affect the ability of the nucleic acid fragment to mediate gene expression or produce a certain phenotype. These terms also refer to modifications of the nucleic acid fragments of the instant invention such as deletion or insertion of one or more nucleotides that do not substantially alter the functional properties of the resulting nucleic acid fragment relative to the initial, unmodified fragment. It is therefore understood, as those skilled in the art will appreciate, that the invention encompasses more than the specific exemplary sequences. "Regulatory sequences" or "regulatory elements" are used interchangeably and refer to nucleotide sequences located upstream (5' non-coding sequences), within, or downstream (3' non-coding sequences) of a coding sequence, and which influence the transcription, RNA processing or stability, or translation of the associated coding sequence. Regulatory sequences may include, but are not limited to, promoters, translation leader sequences, introns, and polyadenylation recognition sequences. The terms "regulatory sequence" and "regulatory element" are used interchangeably herein. "Promoter" refers to a nucleic acid fragment capable of controlling transcription of another nucleic acid fragment. "Promoter functional in a plant" is a promoter capable of controlling transcription in plant cells whether or not its origin is from a plant cell. Promoters that cause a gene to be expressed in most cell types at most times are commonly referred to as "constitutive promoters". High level, constitutive expression of the candidate gene under control of the 35S or UBI promoter may have pleiotropic effects, although candidate gene efficacy may be estimated when driven by a constitutive promoter. Use of tissue-specific and/or stress-specific promoters may eliminate undesirable effects but retain the ability to enhance drought tolerance. This effect has been observed in Arabidopsis (Kasuga et al. (1999) Nature Biotechnol. 17:287-91 ). "Tissue-specific promoter" and "tissue-preferred promoter" are used interchangeably to refer to a promoter that is expressed predominantly but not necessarily exclusively in one tissue or organ, but that may also be expressed in one specific cell. Examples of some seed-specific promoters are the alpha prime subunit of beta conglycinin promoter, soybean sucrose synthase promoter, Medicago trunculata sucrose synthase promoter, Kunitz trypsin inhibitor 3, annexin promoter, Gly1 promoter, beta subunit of beta conglycinin promoter, P34/Gly Bd m 30K promoter, albumin promoter, Leg A1 promoter and Leg A2 promoter. "Developmentally regulated promoter" refers to a promoter whose activity is determined by developmental events. Inducible promoters selectively express an operably linked DNA sequence in response to the presence of an endogenous or exogenous stimulus, for example by chemical compounds (chemical inducers) or in response to environmental, hormonal, chemical, and/or developmental signals. Examples of inducible or regulated promoters include, but are not limited to, promoters regulated by light, heat, stress, flooding or drought, pathogens, phytohormones, wounding, or chemicals such as ethanol, jasmonate, salicylic acid, or safeners. A minimal or basal promoter is a polynucleotide molecule that is capable of recruiting and binding the basal transcription machinery. One example of basal transcription machinery in eukaryotic cells is the RNA polymerase II complex and its accessory proteins. Plant RNA polymerase II promoters, like those of other higher eukaryotes, are comprised of several distinct "cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements," or simply "cis-elements," each of which appears to confer a different aspect of the overall control of gene expression. Examples of such cis-acting elements include, but are not limited to, such as TATA box and CCAAT or AGGA box. The promoter can roughly be divided in two parts: a proximal part, referred to as the core, and a distal part. The proximal part is believed to be responsible for correctly assembling the RNA polymerase II complex at the right position and for directing a basal level of transcription, and is also referred to as "minimal promoter" or "basal promoter". The distal part of the promoter is believed to contain those elements that regulate the spatio-temporal expression. In addition to the proximal and distal parts, other regulatory regions have also been described, that contain enhancer and/or repressors elements The latter elements can be found from a few kilobase pairs upstream from the transcription start site, in the introns, or even at the 3' side of the genes they regulate (Rombauts, S. et al. (2003) Plant Physiology 132:1 162-1 176, Nikolov and Burley, (1997) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 94: 15-22), Tjian and Maniatis (1994) Ce// 77: 5-8; Fessele et al., 2002 Trends Genet 18: 60-63, Messing et al., (1983) Genetic Engineering of Plants: an Agricultural Perspective, Plenum Press, NY, pp 21 1 -227). When operably linked to a heterologous polynucleotide sequence, a promoter controls the transcription of the linked polynucleotide sequence. Operably linked" refers to the association of nucleic acid fragments in a single fragment so that the function of one is regulated by the other. For example, a promoter is operably linked with a nucleic acid fragment when it is capable of regulating the transcription of that nucleic acid fragment. An intron sequence can be added to the 5' untranslated region, the protein- coding region or the 3' untranslated region to increase the amount of the mature message that accumulates in the cytosol. Inclusion of a spliceable intron in the transcription unit in both plant and animal expression constructs has been shown to increase gene expression at both the mRNA and protein levels up to 1000-fold. Buchman and Berg, Mol. Cell Biol. 8:4395-4405 (1988); Callis et al., Genes Dev. 1 :1 183-1200 (1987). "Expression" refers to the production of a functional product. For example, expression of a nucleic acid fragment may refer to transcription of the nucleic acid fragment (e.g., transcription resulting in mRNA or functional RNA) and/or translation of mRNA into a precursor or mature protein. "Overexpression" refers to the production of a gene product in transgenic organisms that exceeds levels of production in a null segregating (or non- transgenic) organism from the same experiment. "Phenotype" means the detectable characteristics of a cell or organism. "Introduced" in the context of inserting a nucleic acid fragment (e.g., a recombinant DNA construct) into a cell, means "transfection" or "transformation" or "transduction" and includes reference to the incorporation of a nucleic acid fragment into a eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell where the nucleic acid fragment may be incorporated into the genome of the cell (e.g., chromosome, plasmid, plastid or mitochondrial DNA), converted into an autonomous replicon, or transiently expressed (e.g., transfected mRNA). A "transfornned cell" is any cell into which a nucleic acid fragment (e.g., a recombinant DNA construct) has been introduced. "Transformation" as used herein refers to both stable transformation and transient transformation. "Stable transformation" refers to the introduction of a nucleic acid fragment into a genome of a host organism resulting in genetically stable inheritance. Once stably transformed, the nucleic acid fragment is stably integrated in the genome of the host organism and any subsequent generation. "Transient transformation" refers to the introduction of a nucleic acid fragment into the nucleus, or DNA-containing organelle, of a host organism resulting in gene expression without genetically stable inheritance. "Allele" is one of several alternative forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome. When the alleles present at a given locus on a pair of homologous chromosomes in a diploid plant are the same that plant is homozygous at that locus. If the alleles present at a given locus on a pair of homologous chromosomes in a diploid plant differ that plant is heterozygous at that locus. If a transgene is present on one of a pair of homologous chromosomes in a diploid plant that plant is hemizygous at that locus. The term "crossed" or "cross" means the fusion of gametes via pollination to produce progeny (e.g., cells, seeds or plants). The term encompasses both sexual crosses (the pollination of one plant by another) and selfing (self-pollination, e.g., when the pollen and ovule are from the same plant). The term "crossing" refers to the act of fusing gametes via pollination to produce progeny. A "favorable allele" is the allele at a particular locus that confers, or contributes to, a desirable phenotype, e.g., increased cell wall digestibility, or alternatively, is an allele that allows the identification of plants with decreased cell wall digestibility that can be removed from a breeding program or planting ("counterselection"). A favorable allele of a marker is a marker allele that segregates with the favorable phenotype, or alternatively, segregates with the unfavorable plant phenotype, therefore providing the benefit of identifying plants. "Suppression DNA construct" is a recombinant DNA construct which when transformed or stably integrated into the genome of the plant, results in "silencing" of a target gene in the plant. The target gene may be endogenous or transgenic to the plant. "Silencing," as used herein with respect to the target gene, refers generally to the suppression of levels of mRNA or protein/enzyme expressed by the target gene, and/or the level of the enzyme activity or protein functionality. The terms "suppression", "suppressing" and "silencing", used interchangeably herein, include lowering, reducing, declining, decreasing, inhibiting, eliminating or preventing. "Silencing" or "gene silencing" does not specify mechanism and is inclusive, and not limited to, anti-sense, cosuppression, viral-suppression, hairpin suppression, stem- loop suppression, RNAi-based approaches, and small RNA-based approaches. A suppression DNA construct may comprise a region derived from a target gene of interest and may comprise all or part of the nucleic acid sequence of the sense strand (or antisense strand) of the target gene of interest. Depending upon the approach to be utilized, the region may be 100% identical or less than 100% identical (e.g., at least 50%, 51 %, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61 %, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71 %, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81 %, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91 %, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% identical) to all or part of the sense strand (or antisense strand) of the gene of interest. Suppression DNA constructs are well-known in the art, are readily constructed once the target gene of interest is selected, and include, without limitation, cosuppression constructs, antisense constructs, viral-suppression constructs, hairpin suppression constructs, stem-loop suppression constructs, double-stranded RNA-producing constructs, and more generally, RNAi (RNA interference) constructs and small RNA constructs such as siRNA (short interfering RNA) constructs and miRNA (microRNA) constructs. "Antisense inhibition" refers to the production of antisense RNA transcripts capable of suppressing the expression of the target gene or gene product. "Antisense RNA" refers to an RNA transcript that is complementary to all or part of a target primary transcript or mRNA and that blocks the expression of a target isolated nucleic acid fragment (U.S. Patent No. 5,107,065). The complementarity of an antisense RNA may be with any part of the specific gene transcript, i.e., at the 5' non-coding sequence, 3' non-coding sequence, introns, or the coding sequence. "Cosuppression" refers to the production of sense RNA transcripts capable of suppressing the expression of the target gene or gene product. "Sense" RNA refers to RNA transcript that includes the mRNA and can be translated into protein within a cell or in vitro. Cosuppression constructs in plants have been previously designed by focusing on overexpression of a nucleic acid sequence having homology to a native mRNA, in the sense orientation, which results in the reduction of all RNA having homology to the overexpressed sequence (see Vaucheret et al., Plant J. 16:651 -659 (1998); and Gura, Nature 404:804-808 (2000)). Another variation describes the use of plant viral sequences to direct the suppression of proximal mRNA encoding sequences (PCT Publication No. WO 98/36083 published on August 20, 1998). RNA interference refers to the process of sequence-specific post- transcriptional gene silencing in animals mediated by short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Fire et al., Nature 391 :806 (1998)). The corresponding process in plants is commonly referred to as post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) or RNA silencing and is also referred to as quelling in fungi. The process of post- transcriptional gene silencing is thought to be an evolutionarily-conserved cellular defense mechanism used to prevent the expression of foreign genes and is commonly shared by diverse flora and phyla (Fire et al., Trends Genet. 15:358 (1999)). Small RNAs play an important role in controlling gene expression. Regulation of many developmental processes, including flowering, is controlled by small RNAs. It is now possible to engineer changes in gene expression of plant genes by using transgenic constructs which produce small RNAs in the plant. Small RNAs appear to function by base-pairing to complementary RNA or DNA target sequences. When bound to RNA, small RNAs trigger either RNA cleavage or translational inhibition of the target sequence. When bound to DNA target sequences, it is thought that small RNAs can mediate DNA methylation of the target sequence. The consequence of these events, regardless of the specific mechanism, is that gene expression is inhibited. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs of about 19 to about 24 nucleotides (nt) in length that have been identified in both animals and plants (Lagos-Quintana et al., Science 294:853-858 (2001 ), Lagos-Quintana et al., Curr. Biol. 12:735-739 (2002); Lau et al., Science 294:858-862 (2001 ); Lee and Ambros, Science 294:862-864 (2001 ); Llave et al., Plant Cell 14:1605-1619 (2002); Mourelatos et al., Genes. Dev. 16:720-728 (2002); Park et al., Curr. Biol. 12:1484- 1495 (2002); Reinhart et al., Genes. Dev. 16:1616-1626 (2002)). They are processed from longer precursor transcripts that range in size from approximately 70 to 200 nt, and these precursor transcripts have the ability to form stable hairpin structures. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) appear to regulate target genes by binding to complementary sequences located in the transcripts produced by these genes. It seems likely that miRNAs can enter at least two pathways of target gene regulation: (1 ) translational inhibition; and (2) RNA cleavage. MicroRNAs entering the RNA cleavage pathway are analogous to the 21 -25 nt short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) generated during RNA interference (RNAi) in animals and posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants, and likely are incorporated into an RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) that is similar or identical to that seen for RNAi. Transcription factors are proteins that generally bind DNA in a sequence- specific manner and either activate or repress transcription initiation. At least three types of separate domains have been identified within transcription factors. One is necessary for sequence-specific DNA recognition, one for the activation/repression of transcriptional initiation, and one for the formation of protein-protein interactions (such as dimerization). Studies indicate that many plant transcription factors can be grouped into distinct classes based on their conserved DNA binding domains (Katagiri F and Chua N H, 1992, Trends Genet. 8:22-27; Menkens A E, Schindler U and Cashmore A R, 1995, Trends in Biochem Sci. 13:506-510; Martin C and Paz- Ares J, 1997, Trends Genet. 13:67-73). Each member of these families interacts and binds with distinct DNA sequence motifs that are often found in multiple gene promoters controlled by different regulatory signals. Ovule Development Proteins (ODP) are transcription factors containing two AP2 domains. AP2 transcription factors (herein referred to interchangeably as "AP2 domain transcription factors", "AP2 proteins", "AP2/ EREBP transcription factors", or "AP2 transcription factor proteins") such as ODP activate several genes in the oil or TAG biosynthetic pathway in the plant cell. The term "ODP1 " refers to an ovule development protein 1 that is involved with increasing oil content. ODP1 is a member of the APETALA2 (AP2) family of proteins that play a role in a variety of biological events including, but not limited to, oil content. US Patent Application No. 61/165,548 describes the use of an ODP1 gene for alteration of oil traits in plants. US Patent No. 7,579,529 describes an AP2 domain transcription factor and methods of its use. US Patent No. 7,157,621 discloses the use of ODP1 transcription factor for increasing oil content in plants. DuPont patent application WO 2010/1 14989 describes the use of an Arabidopsis Sus2 promoter to drive ODP1 (WRI1 ) expression in Arabidopsis. The putative AP2/EREBP transcription factor WRINKLED1 (WRI1 ) is involved in the regulation of seed storage metabolism in Arabidopsis (Cernac and Benning( 2004) Plant J. 40:575-585). Expression of the WRI1 cDNA under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter led to increased seed oil content. Oil-accumulating seedlings, however, showed aberrant development consistent with a prolonged embryonic state. Nucleic acid molecules encoding WRINKLED1 -LIKE polypeptides and methods of use are also described in International Publication No. WO 2006/00732 A2. The AP2/EREBP family of proteins is a plant-specific class of putative transcription factors that have been shown to regulate a wide-variety of developmental processes and are characterized by the presence of an AP2/ERF DNA binding domain. Specifically, AP2 (APETALA2) and EREBPs (ethylene- responsive element binding proteins) are the prototypic members of a family of transcription factors unique to plants, whose distinguishing characteristic is that they contain the so-called AP2 DNA-binding domain. DNA sequence analysis suggests that AP2 encodes a theoretical polypeptide of 432 aa, with a distinct 68 aa repeated motif termed the AP2 domain. This domain has been shown to be essential for AP2 functions and contains within the 68 aa motif an eighteen amino acid core region that is predicted to form an amphipathic a-helix (Jofuku et al., Plant Cell 6:121 1 - 1225, 1994). AP2-like domain-containing transcription factors have been also been identified in both Arabidopsis thaliana (Okamuro et al.,( 1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:7076-7081 ,) and in tobacco with the identification of the ethylene responsive element binding proteins (EREBPs) (Ohme-Takagi and Shinshi, (1995) Plant Cell 7:2:173-182,). HAP proteins constitute a large family of transcription factors first identified in yeast. They combine to form a heteromeric protein complex that activates transcription by binding to CCAAT boxes in eukaryotic promoters. The orthologous Hap proteins display a high degree of evolutionary conservation in their functional domains in all species studied to date (Li et al. (1992) Nucleic Acids Res 20:1087- 1091 ). Leafy cotyledon 1 (Led or Lec1 /Hap3) is a transcription factor that is a key regulator of seed development in plants. Led is a CCAAT-binding factor (CBF) - type transcription factor. The terms "leafy cotyledon 1 ", "Led ", and "Hap3/Lec1 " are used interchangeably herein. LEC1 polypeptide is homologous to the HAP3 subunit of the CBF class of eukaryotic transcriptional activators that includes NF-Y, CP1 , and HAP2/3/4/5 (Lotan et al. (1998) Cell, Vol. 93, 1 195-1205, June 26). The leafy cotyledonl (LEC1 ) gene controls many distinct aspects of embryogenesis. The led mutation is pleiotropic, which suggest that LEC1 has several roles in late embryo development. For example, LEC1 is required for specific aspects of seed maturation, inhibiting premature germination and plays a role in the specification of embryonic organ identity. Finally, LEC1 appears to act only during embryo development. US Patent No. 6235975 describes leafy cotyledonl genes and their uses. A pending US patent application (US Application No. 1 1 /899370) relates to isolated nucleic acid fragments encoding Led related transcription factors. US Patent Nos. 7294759, US7157621 , US 7888560, US6825397 describe the use of Led genes for altering oil content in plants. In Arabidopsis, Led has been shown to regulate the expression of fatty acid biosynthetic genes and Led has also been shown to be involved in embryo development (Mu et al ., Plant Physiology (2008) 148: 1042-1054; Lotan et al. (1998) Cell, Vol. 93, 1 195-1205, June 26; PCT publication number WO/1998037184 & US Patent Nos. 6235975, 6320102, 6545201 ; PCT publication no. WO/2001064022 & US patent 6781035, Braybrook, S.A. and Harada, J.J. (2008) Trends Plant Sci 13(12): 1360-1385). WO 99/67405 describes leafy cotyledon 1 genes and their uses. A maize Led homologue of the Arabidopsis embryogenesis controlling gene AtLECI has been shown to increase oil content and transformation efficiencies in plants. See, for example, WO 03001902 and U.S. Patent No. 6,512,165. Other polypeptides that influence ovule and embryo development and stimulate cell growth, such as, Led , Kn1 , WUSCHEL, Zwille and Aintegumeta (ANT) allow for increased transformation efficiencies when expressed in plants. See, for example, U.S. Application No. 2003/0135889, herein incorporated by reference. In fact, a maize Led homologue of the Arabidopsis embryogenesis controlling gene AtLECI , has been shown to increase oil content and transformation efficiencies in plants. See, for example, WO 03001902 and U .S. Patent No. 6,512,165. Led homologs may be further identified by using conserved sequence motifs, such as the following amino acid sequence (given in single letter code, with "x" representing any amino acid) (US application number 60/301 ,913). Underlined amino acids in the following sequence are those that are conserved in Led but not found in Led -related proteins: REQDxxMPxANVxRIMRxxLPxxAKISDDAKExIQECVSExISFxTxEANxRCxxxx RKTxxxE The terms "FUS3", "FUSCA3" are used interchangeably herein. FUSCA3 is a transcription factor with a conserved VP1 /ABI3-like B3 domain which is of functional importance for the regulation of seed maturation in Arabidopsis thaliana. It controls developmental timing in Arabidopsis through the hormones gibberellin and abscisic acid and is itself regulated by the Led transcription factor (Luerssen et al. (1998) Plant J (1998) 15 (6): 755-7; Stone et al. (2001 ) Proc Natl Acad Sci 98 (20): 1 1806-1 181 1 ; Lee et al. (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci 100 (4): 2152-2156, US Patent Nos. US751 1 190 and US7446241 , PCT Publication No. WO1998021336, PCT Publication No. WO2008157226, Braybrook, S.A. and Harada, J.J. (2008) Trends Plant Sci 13(12): 1360-1385). US Patent No. US7612253 describes methods of modulating cytokinin related processes in a plant using B3 domain proteins with a number of fusca3 homologs. "Diacylglycerol acyltransferase" or "DGAT" (also known as "acyl-CoA- diacylglycerol acyltransferase" or "diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase") (EC 2.3.1 .20) is an integral membrane protein that catalyzes the final enzymatic step in the production of triacylglycerols in plants, fungi and mammals. This enzyme is responsible for transferring an acyl group from acyl-coenzyme-A to the sn-3 position of 1 ,2-diacylglycerol ("DAG") to form triacylglycerol ("TAG"). DGAT is associated with membrane and lipid body fractions in plants and fungi, particularly, in oilseeds where it contributes to the storage of carbon used as energy reserves. DGAT is known to regulate TAG structure and direct TAG synthesis. Furthermore, it is known that the DGAT reaction is specific for oil synthesis (Lardizabal et al ., J. Biol. Chem. 276(42):38862-28869 (2001 )). Two different families of DGAT proteins have been identified. The first family of DGAT proteins ("DGAT1 ") is related to the acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase ("ACAT") and has been described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,100,077 and 6,344,548. A second family of DGAT proteins ("DGAT2") is unrelated to the DGAT1 family and is described in PCT Patent Publication WO 2004/01 1671 published February 5, 2004. Other references to DGAT genes and their use in plants include PCT Publication No. WO1998/055,631 and US Patent No. 6822141 . "DGAT" and "diacylglycerol acyltransferase" are used interchangeably herein and refer to any member, or combination, of the DGAT1 or DGAT2 family of proteins. Plant and fungal DGAT genes have been described previously (US Patent Nos. 7198937 and 7465565, US Publication No. 20080295204, US Application Nos. 12/470569 and 12/470517). "Carbonic anhydrase" (CA, EC 4.2.1 .1 .) is a zinc- containing metalloenzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydration of CO2 to HCO3 . The widespread abundance of CA isoforms in plants, animals, and microorganisms suggest that this enzyme has many diverse roles in biological processes. In photosynthetic organisms, one generally accepted physiological role of CA is to provide sufficient levels of inorganic carbon as part of a CO2-concentrating mechanism for improved photosynthetic efficiency. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, it has been suggested that chloroplastic CA (plastidial carbonic anhydrase) plays a role in photosynthetic carbon assimilation by converting accumulated pools of HCO3 to CO2, which is the substrate for Rubisco (Chau et al. Plant Physiol. (2002) 128: 1417-1427. The present invention relates to the use of plastidic carbonic anhydrase to further increase oil content in seeds that already show increased oil contents due to expression of DGAT and /or ODP1 genes. It is being shown that plastidic carbonic anhydrase genes show increased expression in developing seeds of transgenic plants with increased seed oil content due to expression of the AP2 domain trans-cription factor, such as but not limited to ZM-ODP1 or due to the expression DGAT. Co-expression in soybean somatic embryos of genes from GM-CA and GM-CA2 or one gene for Arabidopsis (Ath-BCA5) with YL-DGAT2, increases oil content to levels that are not achieved with YL-DGAT2 alone. "Agronomic traits" as used herein include traits that enhance production and consistency of production of soybean grain. Pests that have devastating effects on the agronomics and economics of soybean production, affecting yield and quality of grain and seed, include, but are not limited to weeds, fungi, insects, nematodes, and viruses. Also included is the enhancement or neutrality in yield in response to biotic or abiotic stresses, cultivation, and tolerance to factors such as climate and soil. "Quality-improvement traits" or "quality improving trait" include, but are not limited to, higher oil, higher protein, modifications in essential amino acids and protein compositional changes, changes in oil composition, nutritional traits such as vitamins, and new industrial uses including biodiesel, bio-lubricants, and polymers. Stacking Other Traits of Interest. The recombinant construct(s) of the invention can be combined with any agronomic trait and/or quality-improvement trait. In some embodiments the recombinant constructs of the invention disclosed herein are engineered into a molecular stack. Thus, the various host cells, plants, plant cells and seeds disclosed herein can further comprise one or more traits of interest, and in more specific embodiments, the host cell, plant, plant part or plant cell is stacked with any combination of polynucleotide sequences of interest in order to create plants with a desired combination of traits. The traits can be agronomic or quality traits as described herein or any combination thereof. As used herein, the term "stacked" includes having the multiple traits present in the same plant or organism of interest. In one non-limiting example, "stacked traits" comprise a molecular stack where the sequences are physically adjacent to each other. A trait, as used herein, refers to the phenotype derived from a particular sequence or groups of sequences. In one embodiment, the molecular stack comprises at least one recombinant DNA construct comprising at least one first heterologous polynucleotide encoding a plastidic carbonic anhydrase polypeptide, wherein said polynucleotide is operably linked to at least one regulatory sequence and at least one second heterologous polynucleotide encoding a DGAT polypeptide and at least one additional polynucleotide that confers tolerance to abiotic and biotic stresses. In another embodiment, the at least one additional polynucleotide confers tolerance to a fungicide, herbicide, or insecticide. The at least one second heterologous polynucleotide may encode an DGAT 1 , DGAT2, ODP1 , a Led or FUSCA3 polypeptide or any other quality improving trait as described herein. Furthermore, the stack may further comprise a construct downregulating galactinol synthase activity. In one embodiment the stack(s) of the invention may further comprise(s) a construct downregulating PGM activity. Thus, in one embodiment, the host cells, plants, plant cells or plant part having the recombinant constructs of the invention disclosed herein is stacked with at least one other fungicide, herbicide, or insecticide sequence. Some examples of such fungicide, herbicide, or insecticide sequence are disclosed for example in WO02/36782, US Publication 2004/0082770 and WO 2005/012515, US Patent No. 7,462,481 , US Patent No. 7,405,074. In some embodiments, the molecular stacks may comprise other herbicide- tolerance traits to create a transgenic plant of the disclosure with further properties. Other traits for example include polynucleotides that confer on the plant the capacity to produce a higher level or glyphosate insensitive 5- enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), for example, as more fully described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,248,876 B1 ; 5,627,061 ; 5,804,425; 5,633,435; 5,145,783; 4,971 ,908; 5,312,910; 5,188,642; 4,940,835; 5,866,775; 6,225,1 14 B1 ; 6,130,366; 5,310,667; 4,535,060; 4,769,061 ; 5,633,448; 5,510,471 ; Re. 36,449; RE 37,287 E; and 5,491 ,288; and international publications WO 97/04103; WO 00/66746; WO 01 /66704; WO 00/66747, WO2007064828, WO20061 10586, WO2007146765, WO2008002964, US App. Pubs. 2009/0307802, 201/0197499, 2009/0209427, and US Patent Nos. 8,436,159 and 6,040,497. These stacked combinations can be created by any method including, but not limited to, breeding plants by any conventional methodology, or genetic transformation. If the sequences are stacked by genetically transforming the plants, the polynucleotide sequences of interest can be combined at any time and in any order. The traits can be introduced simultaneously in a co-transformation protocol with the polynucleotides of interest provided by any combination of transformation cassettes. For example, if two sequences will be introduced, the two sequences can be contained in separate transformation cassettes (trans) or contained on the same transformation cassette (cis). Expression of the sequences can be driven by the same promoter or by different promoters. In certain cases, it may be desirable to introduce a transformation cassette that will suppress the expression of the polynucleotide of interest, such a galactinol synthase. This may be combined with any combination of other suppression cassettes or overexpression cassettes to generate the desired combination of traits in the plant. It is further recognized that polynucleotide sequences can be stacked at a desired genomic location using a site-specific recombination system. See, for example, WO99/25821 , WO99/25854, WO99/25840, WO99/25855, and WO99/25853, all of which are herein incorporated by reference. In one embodiment, a recombinant DNA construct comprising at least one first heterologous polynucleotide encoding a plastidic carbonic anhydrase polypeptide, wherein said polynucleotide is operably linked to at least one regulatory sequence and at least one second heterologous polynucleotide encoding a DGAT polypeptide operably linked to at least one regulatory sequence, wherein expression of said recombinant DNA construct in a transgenic soybean seed results in an increased oil content in a transgenic soybean seed, when compared to a control seed that expresses said second polypeptide but does not express said first polypeptide. The second heterologous polynucleotide may encode an ODP1 , a Led or FUSCA3 polypeptide. Furthermore, the recombinant construct may further comprise a construct downregulating galactinol synthase activity, wherein the first heterologous polynucleotide, the second heterologous polynucleotide and the galactinol synthase construct can be in the same construct or in separate constructs.

The term "fatty acids" refers to long chain aliphatic acids (alkanoic acids) of varying chain length, from about C12 to C22 (although both longer and shorter chain- length acids are known). The predominant chain lengths are between Ci6 and C22- The structure of a fatty acid is represented by a simple notation system of "X:Y", where X is the total number of carbon (C) atoms in the particular fatty acid and Y is the number of double bonds. Generally, fatty acids are classified as saturated or unsaturated. The term "saturated fatty acids" refers to those fatty acids that have no "double bonds" between their carbon backbone. In contrast, "unsaturated fatty acids" have "double bonds" along their carbon backbones (which are most commonly in the cis- configu ration). "Monounsaturated fatty acids" have only one "double bond" along the carbon backbone (e.g., usually between the 9th and 10th carbon atom as for palmitoleic acid (16:1 ) and oleic acid (18:1 )), while "polyunsaturated fatty acids" (or "PUFAs") have at least two double bonds along the carbon backbone (e.g., between the 9th and 10th, and 12th and 13th carbon atoms for linoleic acid (18:2); and between the 9th and 10th, 12th and 13th, and 15th and 16th for a-linolenic acid (18:3)). "Lipid bodies" refer to lipid droplets that usually are bounded by specific proteins and a monolayer of phospholipid. These organelles are sites where most organisms transport/store neutral lipids. Lipid bodies are thought to arise from microdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum that contain TAG-biosynthesis enzymes; and, their synthesis and size appear to be controlled by specific protein components. "Neutral lipids" refer to those lipids commonly found in cells in lipid bodies as storage fats and oils and are so called because at cellular pH, the lipids bear no charged groups. Generally, they are completely non-polar with no affinity for water. Neutral lipids generally refer to mono-, di-, and/or triesters of glycerol with fatty acids, also called monoacylglycerol, diacylglycerol or TAG, respectively (or collectively, acylglycerols). A hydrolysis reaction must occur to release free fatty acids from acylglycerols. The term "oil" refers to a lipid substance that is liquid at 25° C. and usually polyunsaturated. In contrast, the term "fat" refers to a lipid substance that is solid at 25° C. and usually saturated. The terms "triacylglycerol", "oil" and "TAGs" are used interchangeably herein, and refer to neutral lipids composed of three fatty acyl residues esterified to a glycerol molecule (and such terms will be used interchangeably throughout the present disclosure herein). Such oils can contain long chain PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids), as well as shorter saturated and unsaturated fatty acids and longer chain saturated fatty acids. Thus, "oil biosynthesis" generically refers to the synthesis of TAGs in the cell (PCT Publication Nos. WO2005063988, WO2007087492, WO2007101273 and WO2007103738, US Patent No. US7812216). Oil and protein content in seeds can be determined using Near Infrared Spectroscopy by methods familiar to one skilled in the art (Agelet, et al. (2012) Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 60(34): 8314-8322). An apparatus and methods for NIR analysis of single seeds and multiple seeds has been described in US Patent No. 7,508,517, herein incorporated by reference. Additional methods for the analysis of seed composition are provided in US Patent No. 8,143,473, herein incorporated by reference. Medicago truncatula is a small legume native to the Mediterranean region that is used in genomic research. This species has been used as a model organism for legume biology because it has a small diploid genome, is self-fertile, has a rapid generation time and prolific seed production, and is amenable to genetic transformation. The term "sucrose synthase" (SUS) refers to an enzyme used in carbohydrate metabolism that catalyzes the reversible conversion of sucrose and uridine diphosphate (UDP) to UDP-glucose and fructose in vitro. The terms "Soybean sucrose synthase 2" and "GmSuS" are used interchangeably herein. The Soybean sucrose synthase gene is from genomic locus Glyma13g17420. The term "germination" refers to the process by which a dormant seed begins to sprout and grow into a seedling. "Normal germination", as used herein, refers to a germination rate for seed of a transgenic plant comprising the recombinant DNA construct that is within at least 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91 %, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100% of the observed germination rate, under the same conditions, for seed of a corresponding control plant that does not comprise the recombinant DNA construct. In an embodiment of the present invention, the "cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements" from the promoter sequence disclosed herein can be operabiy linked to "cis-acting transcriptional regulatory elements" from any heterologous promoter. Such a chimeric promoter molecule can be engineered to have desired regulatory properties. In an embodiment of this invention a fragment of the disclosed promoter sequence that can act either as a cis-regulatory sequence or a distal-regulatory sequence or as an enhancer sequence or a repressor sequence, may be combined with either a cis-regulatory or a distal regulatory or an enhancer sequence or a repressor sequence or any combination of any of these from a heterologous promoter sequence. In a related embodiment, a cis-element of the disclosed promoter may confer a particular specificity such as conferring enhanced expression of operabiy linked polynucleotide molecules in certain tissues and therefore is also capable of regulating transcription of operabiy linked polynucleotide molecules. Promoter fragments that comprise regulatory elements can be added, for example, fused to the 5' end of, or inserted within, another promoter having its own partial or complete regulatory sequences (Fluhr et al., Science 232:1 106-1 1 12, 1986; Ellis et al., EMBO J. 6:1 1 -16, 1987; Strittmatter and Chua, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 84:8986-8990, 1987; Poulsen and Chua, Mol. Gen. Genet. 214:16-23, 1988; Comai et al., Plant Mol. Biol. 15:373-381 , 1991 ; 1987; Aryan et al., Mol. Gen. Genet. 225:65-71 , 1991 ). Cis elements can be identified by a number of techniques, including deletion analysis, i.e., deleting one or more nucleotides from the 5' end or internal to a promoter; DNA binding protein analysis using DNase I footprinting; methylation interference; electrophoresis mobility-shift assays, in vivo genomic footprinting by ligation-mediated PCR; and other conventional assays; or by sequence similarity with known cis element motifs by conventional sequence comparison methods. The fine structure of a cis element can be further studied by mutagenesis (or substitution) of one or more nucleotides or by other conventional methods (see for example, Methods in Plant Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dashek, ed., CRC Press, 1997, pp. 397-422; and Methods in Plant Molecular Biology, Maliga et al., eds., Cold Spring Harbor Press, 1995, pp. 233-300). Cis elements can be obtained by chemical synthesis or by cloning from promoters that include such elements, and they can be synthesized with additional flanking sequences that contain useful restriction enzyme sites to facilitate subsequent manipulation. Promoter fragments may also comprise other regulatory elements such as enhancer domains, which may further be useful for constructing chimeric molecules. Methods for construction of chimeric and variant promoters of the present invention include, but are not limited to, combining control elements of different promoters or duplicating portions or regions of a promoter (see for example, 4990607USA U.S. Patent No. 4,990,607; 51 10732USA U.S. Patent No. 5,1 10,732; and 5097025USA U.S. Patent No. 5,097,025). Those of skill in the art are familiar with the standard resource materials that describe specific conditions and procedures for the construction, manipulation, and isolation of macromolecules (e.g., polynucleotide molecules and plasmids), as well as the generation of recombinant organisms and the screening and isolation of polynucleotide molecules. In an embodiment of the present invention, the soy sucrose synthase promoter disclosed herein can be modified. Those skilled in the art can create promoters that have variations in the polynucleotide sequence. As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, modification or alteration of the promoter sequence can also be made without substantially affecting the promoter function. The methods are well known to those of skill in the art. Sequences can be modified, for example by insertion, deletion, or replacement of template sequences in a PCR- based DNA modification approach. The present invention encompasses functional fragments and variants of the promoter sequence disclosed herein. A "functional fragment "herein is defined as any subset of contiguous nucleotides of the promoter sequence disclosed herein, that can perform the same, or substantially similar function as the full length promoter sequence disclosed herein. A "functional fragment" with substantially similar function to the full length promoter disclosed herein refers to a functional fragment that retains largely the same level of activity as the full length promoter sequence and exhibits the same pattern of expression as the full length promoter sequence. A "functional fragment" of the promoter sequence disclosed herein exhibits constitutive expression. A "variant" , as used herein, is the sequence of the promoter or the sequence of a functional fragment of a promoter containing changes in which one or more nucleotides of the original sequence is deleted, added, and/or substituted, while substantially maintaining promoter function. One or more base pairs can be inserted, deleted, or substituted internally to a promoter. In the case of a promoter fragment, variant promoters can include changes affecting the transcription of a minimal promoter to which it is operably linked. Variant promoters can be produced, for example, by standard DNA mutagenesis techniques or by chemically synthesizing the variant promoter or a portion thereof. Variant polynucleotides also encompass sequences derived from a mutagenic and recombinogenic procedure such as DNA shuffling. With such a procedure, one or more cis-elements for the promoter can be manipulated to create a new enhancer domain. In this manner, libraries of recombinant polynucleotides are generated from a population of related sequence polynucleotides comprising sequence regions that have substantial sequence identity and can be homologously recombined in vitro or in vivo. Strategies for such DNA shuffling are known in the art. See, for example, Stemmer (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 A 0747-10751 ; Stemmer (1994) Nature 370:389-391 ; Crameri et al. (1997) Nature Biotech. 75:436-438; Moore et al. (1997) J. Mol. Biol. 272:336-347; Zhang et al. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:4504- 4509; Crameri et al. (1998) Nature 391 :288-291 ; and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,605,793 and 5,837,458. Substitutions, deletions, insertions or any combination thereof can be combined to produce a final construct. For polynucleotides, naturally occurring variants can be identified with the use of well-known molecular biology techniques, such as, for example, with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization techniques as outlined herein. Generally, variants of a particular polynucleotide of the invention will have at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91 %, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or more sequence identity to that particular polynucleotide as determined by sequence alignment programs and parameters described elsewhere herein. A biologically active variant of a polynucleotide of the invention may differ from that sequence by as few as 1 -15 nucleic acid residues, as few as 1 -10, such as 6-10, as few as 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or even 1 nucleic acid residue. The promoter of the present invention may also be a promoter which comprises a nucleotide sequence hybridizable under stringent conditions with the complementary strand of the nucleotide sequence as described in PCT publication (PCT/US12/70828, incorporated herewith by reference). Hybridization of such sequences may be carried out under stringent conditions. The terms "stringent conditions" and "stringent hybridization conditions" as used herein refer to conditions under which a probe will hybridize to its target sequence to a detectably greater degree than to other sequences (e.g., at least 2- fold over background). Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances. By controlling the stringency of the hybridization and/or washing conditions, target sequences that are 100% complementary to the probe can be identified (homologous probing). Alternatively, stringency conditions can be adjusted to allow some mismatching in sequences so that lower degrees of similarity are detected (heterologous probing). The term "under stringent conditions" means that two sequences hybridize under moderately or highly stringent conditions. More specifically, moderately stringent conditions can be readily determined by those having ordinary skill in the art, e.g., depending on the length of DNA. The basic conditions are set forth by Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, third edition, chapters 6 and 7, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 2001 and include the use of a prewashing solution for nitrocellulose filters 5xSSC, 0.5% SDS, 1 .0 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), hybridization conditions of about 50% formamide, 2xSSC to 6xSSC at about 40-50 °C (or other similar hybridization solutions, such as Stark's solution, in about 50% formamide at about 42 °C) and washing conditions of, for example, about 40- 60 °C, 0.5-6xSSC, 0.1 % SDS. Preferably, moderately stringent conditions include hybridization (and washing) at about 50 °C and 6xSSC. Highly stringent conditions can also be readily determined by those skilled in the art, e.g., depending on the length of DNA. Generally, such conditions include hybridization and/or washing at higher temperature and/or lower salt concentration (such as hybridization at about 65 °C, 6xSSC to 0.2xSSC, preferably 6xSSC, more preferably 2xSSC, most preferably 0.2xSSC), compared to the moderately stringent conditions. For example, highly stringent conditions may include hybridization as defined above, and washing at approximately 65-68 °C, 0.2xSSC, 0.1 % SDS. SSPE (I xSSPE is 0.15 M NaCI, 10 mM NaH2PO4, and 1 .25 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) can be substituted for SSC (1 xSSC is 0.15 M NaCI and 15 mM sodium citrate) in the hybridization and washing buffers; washing is performed for 15 minutes after hybridization is completed. Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. It is also possible to use a commercially available hybridization kit which uses no radioactive substance as a probe. Specific examples include hybridization with an ECL direct labeling & detection system (commercially available from Amersham). Stringent conditions include, for example, hybridization at 42 °C for 4 hours using the hybridization buffer included in the kit, which is supplemented with 5% (w/v) Blocking reagent and 0.5 M NaCI, and washing twice in 0.4% SDS, 0.5xSSC at 55 °C for 20 minutes and once in 2xSSC at room temperature for 5 minutes. Typically, stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is less than about 1 .5 M Na ion, typically about 0.01 to 1 .0 M Na ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30°C for short probes (e.g., 10 to 50 nucleotides) and at least about 60°C for long probes (e.g., greater than 50 nucleotides). Exemplary low stringency conditions include hybridization with a buffer solution of 30 to 35% formamide, 1 M NaCI, 1 % SDS (sodium dodecyl sulphate) at 37°C, and a wash in 1 X to 2X SSC (20X SSC = 3.0 M NaCI/0.3 M trisodium citrate) at 50 to 55°C. Exemplary moderate stringency conditions include hybridization in 40 to 45% formamide, 1 .0 M NaCI, 1 % SDS at 37°C, and a wash in 0.5X to 1 X SSC at 55 to 60°C. Exemplary high stringency conditions include hybridization in 50% formamide, 1 M NaCI, 1 % SDS at 37°C, and a final wash in 0.1 X SSC at 60 to 65°C for a duration of at least 30 minutes. Duration of hybridization is generally less than about 24 hours, usually about 4 to about 12 hours. The duration of the wash time will be at least a length of time sufficient to reach equilibrium. Specificity is typically the function of post-hybridization washes, the critical factors being the ionic strength and temperature of the final wash solution. For DNA-DNA hybrids, the Tm (thermal melting point) can be approximated from the equation of Meinkoth and Wahl (1984) Anal. Biochem. 138:267-284: Tm = 81 .5°C + 16.6 (log M) + 0.41 (%GC) - 0.61 (% form) - 500/L; where M is the molarity of monovalent cations, %GC is the percentage of guanosine and cytosine nucleotides in the DNA, % form is the percentage of formamide in the hybridization solution, and L is the length of the hybrid in base pairs. The Tm is the temperature (under defined ionic strength and pH) at which 50% of a complementary target sequence hybridizes to a perfectly matched probe. Tm is reduced by about 1 °C for each 1 % of mismatching; thus, Tm, hybridization, and/or wash conditions can be adjusted to hybridize to sequences of the desired identity. For example, if sequences with >90% identity are sought, the Tm can be decreased 10°C. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5°C lower than the Tm for the specific sequence and its complement at a defined ionic strength and pH . However, severely stringent conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 1 , 2, 3, or 4°C lower than the Tm; moderately stringent conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10°C lower than the Tm; low stringency conditions can utilize a hybridization and/or wash at 1 1 , 12, 13, 14, 15, or 20°C lower than the Tm. Using the equation, hybridization and wash compositions, and desired Tm, those of ordinary skill will understand that variations in the stringency of hybridization and/or wash solutions are inherently described. If the desired degree of mismatching results in a Tm of less than 45°C (aqueous solution) or 32°C (formamide solution), it is preferred to increase the SSC concentration so that a higher temperature can be used. An extensive guide to the hybridization of nucleic acids is found in Tijssen (1993) Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology— Hybridization with Nucleic Acid Probes, Part I, Chapter 2 (Elsevier, New York); and Ausubel et al., eds. (1995) Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Chapter 2 (Greene Publishing and Wiley-lnterscience, New York). See also Sambrook. In an embodiment of the current invention, isolated sequences that have seed-specific promoter activity and which hybridize under stringent conditions to the soybean sucrose synthase promoter sequence disclosed herein, or to fragments thereof, are encompassed by the present invention. Generally, stringent conditions are selected to be about 5°C lower than the Tm for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH . However, stringent conditions encompass temperatures in the range of about 1 °C to about 20°C lower than the Tm, depending upon the desired degree of stringency as otherwise qualified herein. It is well understood by those skilled in the art that different terminator sequences may be used for the constructs described in the current invention. Terminators include, but are not limited to, bean phaseolin 3' terminator (WO 2004/071467), Glycine max Myb2 3' (US Application No. 12/486793), Glycine max kunitz trypsin inhibitor 3' (WO 2004/071467), Glycine max BD30 (also called P34) 3' (WO 2004/071467), Pisum sativum legumin A2 3' (WO 2004/071467), and Glycine max albumin 2S 3' (WO 2004/071467). In addition, WO 2004/071467 and US Patent No. 7,129,089 describe the further linking together of individual promoter/gene/transcription terminator cassettes in unique combinations and orientations, along with suitable selectable marker cassettes, in order to obtain the desired phenotypic expression. Although this is done mainly using different restriction enzymes sites, one skilled in the art can appreciate that a number of techniques can be utilized to achieve the desired promoter/gene/transcription terminator combination or orientations. In so doing, any combination and orientation of embryo-specific promoter/gene/transcription terminator cassettes can be achieved. One skilled in the art can also appreciate that these cassettes can be located on individual DNA fragments or on multiple fragments where co-expression of genes is the outcome of co-transformation of multiple DNA fragments. Sequence alignments and percent identity calculations may be determined using a variety of comparison methods designed to detect homologous sequences including, but not limited to, the Megalign® program of the LASERGENE® bioinformatics computing suite (DNASTAR® Inc., Madison, Wl). Unless stated otherwise, multiple alignment of the sequences provided herein were performed using the Clustal V method of alignment (Higgins and Sharp (1989) CABIOS. 5:151 -153) with the default parameters (GAP PENALTY=10, GAP LENGTH PENALTY=10). Default parameters for pairwise alignments and calculation of percent identity of protein sequences using the Clustal V method are KTUPLE=1 , GAP PENALTY=3, WINDOW=5 and DIAGONALS SAVED=5. For nucleic acids these parameters are KTUPLE=2, GAP PENALTY=5, WINDOW=4 and DIAGONALS SAVED=4. After alignment of the sequences, using the Clustal V program, it is possible to obtain "percent identity" and "divergence" values by viewing the "sequence distances" table on the same program; unless stated otherwise, percent identities and divergences provided and claimed herein were calculated in this manner. Alternatively, the Clustal W method of alignment may be used. The Clustal W method of alignment (described by Higgins and Sharp, CABIOS. 5:151 -153 (1989); Higgins, D. G. et al., Comput. Appl. Biosci. 8:189-191 (1992)) can be found in the MegAlign™ v6.1 program of the LASERGENE® bioinformatics computing suite (DNASTAR® Inc., Madison, Wis.). Default parameters for multiple alignment correspond to GAP PENALTY=10, GAP LENGTH PENALTY=0.2, Delay Divergent Sequences=30%, DNA Transition Weight=0.5, Protein Weight Matrix=Gonnet Series, DNA Weight Matrix=IUB. For pairwise alignments the default parameters are Alignment=Slow-Accurate, Gap Penalty=10.0, Gap Length=0.10, Protein Weight Matrix=Gonnet 250 and DNA Weight Matrix=IUB. After alignment of the sequences using the Clustal W program, it is possible to obtain "percent identity" and "divergence" values by viewing the "sequence distances" table in the same program. Standard recombinant DNA and molecular cloning techniques used herein are well known in the art and are described more fully in Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E.F. and Maniatis, T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press: Cold Spring Harbor, 1989 (hereinafter "Sambrook"). Compositions: A composition of the present invention is a plant comprising in its genome any of the recombinant DNA constructs (including any of the suppression DNA constructs) of the present invention (such as any of the constructs discussed above). Compositions also include any progeny of the plant, and any seed obtained from the plant or its progeny, wherein the progeny or seed comprises within its genome the recombinant DNA construct (or suppression DNA construct). Progeny includes subsequent generations obtained by self-pollination or out-crossing of a plant. Progeny also includes hybrids and inbreds. In hybrid seed propagated crops, mature transgenic plants can be self- pollinated to produce a homozygous inbred plant. The inbred plant produces seed containing the newly introduced recombinant DNA construct (or suppression DNA construct). These seeds can be grown to produce plants that would exhibit altered oil content or used in a breeding program to produce hybrid seed, which can be grown to produce plants that would exhibit such altered oil content. The modified seed and grain of the invention can also be obtained by breeding with transgenic plants, by breeding between independent transgenic events, by breeding of plants with one or more alleles (including mutant alleles) of genes encoding the proteins of the invention. Breeding, including introgression of transgenic and mutant loci into elite breeding germplasm and adaptation (improvement) of breeding germplasm to the expression of transgenes and mutant alleles, can be facilitated by methods such as by marker assisted selected breeding. Embodiments of the invention include: In one embodiment, a recombinant DNA construct comprising at least one first heterologous polynucleotide encoding a plastidic carbonic anhydrase polypeptide, wherein said polynucleotide is operably linked to at least one regulatory sequence and at least one second heterologous polynucleotide encoding a DGAT polypeptide operably linked to at least one regulatory sequence, wherein expression of said recombinant DNA construct in a transgenic soybean seed results in an increased oil content in a transgenic soybean seed, when compared to a control seed that expresses said second polypeptide but does not express said first polypeptide. In one embodiment, a recombinant DNA construct wherein the second heterologous polynucleotide encodes an ODP1 polypeptide, a Led polypeptide or a FUSCA3 polypeptide.

Additional embodiments comprise plant or a seed comprising the recombinant DNA construct of the invention. The plant or seed can be a soybean plant or soybean seed. The seed(s) of the invention can further comprise a seed treatment. The seed treatment can be a herbicide, an insecticide or a fungicide. There are a large number of chemical compounds in use as herbicides including organic and inorganic molecules, such as but not limited to Phenoxycarboxylic acids (e.g. 2,4 D), Benzoates (e.g. pyrithiobac), Benzonitriles (e.g. Dichlobenil and some of the hydroxybenzonnitriles), Benzothiadiazoles (e.g. Bentazon), Triazines (e.g. chlortriazines and methylthiotriazines), Acetamides (e.g. Acetochlor), Aliphatics (e.g. acrolein), Ureas and phenylureas (e.g.diuron sulphonylureas and monouron), Aromatic acids (e.g. Benzoic acid derivatives, dicamba, picloram ), Carbamates and thiocarbamates (e.g.asulam , desmedipham), Cineoles (e.g. cinmethylin), Cyclohexanediones (e.g.cycloxidim, sethoxydim, Dinitroanilines, Diphenyl ethers e.g.Acifluorfen), Imidazolidinones and imidazolinones (e.g.buthidazole , Imazaquin), Imines (e.g.CGA-248757), N- Phenylphthallmides (e.g.Flumiclorac) , Nitriles (e.g.Bromoxynil ,Dichlobenil ), Organic arsenicals (e.g. cacodylic acid and monosodium methanearsonate), Oxadiazoles and oxydiazolidines (e.g.oxadiazon, methazole), Phenols (e.g.dinoseb), Phenylpyridazines (e.g.Pyridate), Phenyl Triazinones (e.g.Sulfentrazone) ,Phthalamates (e.g.Naptalam),Phosphonic acid derivatives (e.g.glyphosate), Pyrazollums (e.g.Difenzoquat), Pyridazinones and pyridinones (e.g.Norflurizon, Fluridone ), Pyridines and related nitrogenous compounds (e.g. pyrichlor , thiazophyr , paraquat , diquat ), Quinollinecaroxylic acids (e.g.Quinclorac), Tetrahydropyrimidinones, Triazinones (e.g.Metribuzin), Triazoles (e.g.Amitrole) , Triazolopyrimidine sulfonanilides (e.g. Flumetsulam), Uracils, Sodium compounds, Heavy metal sulphate. Low biological impact methods have been of emerging interest in reducing the widespread ecological impacts of chemicals of historic herbicide usage. Thus some research has focused upon formulations that avoid acute toxicity to organisms, especially non-target species. An example of such a herbicide is corn meal gluten, which has virtually no toxicity, but acts by inhibiting seed germination in certain plant species. One embodiment comprises a method of increasing oil content of a soybean seed, the method comprising the steps of introducing into a regenerable soybean cell the recombinant DNA construct(s) of the invention, regenerating a transgenic plant from the regenerable soybean cell of (a) wherein the transgenic plant comprises the recombinant DNA construct; and selecting a transgenic plant,or a transgenic progeny plant from the transgenic plant, wherein seed of the transgenic plant or the transgenic progeny plant comprises the recombinant construct and exhibits increased seed oil content, when compared to a control soybean seed not comprising the DNA recombinant construct. Plants are subject to multiple potential stresses, diseases, and pests, including abiotic stresses such as temperature stress, moisture stress, and nutrient stress, as well as biotic stresses caused by various microbial pathogens, parasites, attack by insects and other pests, and herbivoy. Agronomic experiments focus on a variety of factors relating to crop plants, including yield, diseases, cultivation, and sensitivity to factors such as climate and soil to enhance the plants response to abiotic and biotic stresses. The present invention can be, in practice, combined with one or more stress response(s) including disease control traits in a plant to achieve desired traits for enhanced plant stress resistance. Combining traits that employ distinct modes-of- action can provide protected transgenic plants with superior durability over plants harboring a single control trait because of the reduced probability that resistance will develop in the field. The response to biotic and abiotic stresses, and in particular to identifying elicitors of defense signaling in plants of the invention can be enhanced using methods known to those of skill in the art (see for example US 2014/0090103 A1 , published March 27, 2014. In one embodiment compositions formulated for application to a plant or a part thereof can be applied to the plants of the invention. These compositions may be formulated as a spray, a powder, a granule, or a seed treatment. Another embodiment includes expressing a polypeptide as a transgene effective in enhancing the plants response to abiotic or biotic stresses in the plants of the invention. Pesticides and insecticides that are useful in compositions in combination with the methods and compositions of the present invention, including as seed treatments and coatings as well as methods for using such compositions can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,551 ,962. Although it is believed that the seed treatments can be applied to a transgenic seed in any physiological state, it may be preferred that the seed be in a sufficiently durable state that it incurs no damage during the treatment process. Typically, the seed would be a seed that had been harvested from the field; removed from the transgenic plant; and separated from any other non-seed plant material. The seed would preferably also be biologically stable to the extent that the treatment would cause no biological damage to the seed. Unless advised otherwise, it is believed that the treatment can be applied to the seed at any time between harvest of the seed and sowing of the seed. As used herein, the term "unsown seed" is meant to include seed at any period between the harvest of the seed and the sowing of the seed in the ground for the purpose of germination and growth of the plant. When it is said that unsown seed is "treated" with the pesticide, such treatment is not meant to include those practices in which the pesticide is applied to the soil, rather than to the seed. The pesticide, or combination of pesticides, can be applied "neat", that is, without any diluting or additional components present. However, the pesticide is typically applied to the seeds in the form of a pesticide formulation. This formulation may contain one or more other desirable components including but not limited to liquid diluents, binders to serve as a matrix for the pesticide, fillers for protecting the seeds during stress conditions, and plasticizers to improve flexibility, adhesion and/or spreadability of the coating. The subject pesticides can be applied to a seed as a component of a seed coating. Seed coating methods and compositions that are known in the art are useful when they are modified by the addition of one of the embodiments of the combination of pesticides of the present invention. Such coating methods and apparatus for their application are disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,918,413, 5,891 ,246, 5,554,445, 5,389,399, 5,107,787, 5,080,925, 4,759,945 and 4,465,017. Seed coating compositions are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,939,356, 5,882,713, 5,876,739, 5,849,320, 5,834,447, 5,791 ,084, 5,661 ,103, 5,622,003, 5,580,544, 5,328,942, 5,300,127, 4,735,015, 4,634,587,4,383,391 , 4,372,080, 4,339,456, 4,272,417 and 4,245,432, among others. The pesticides that are useful in the coating are those pesticides that are described herein. The amount of pesticide that is used for the treatment of the seed will vary depending upon the type of seed and the type of active ingredients, but the treatment will comprise contacting the seeds with an amount of the combination of pesticides that is pesticidally effective. When insects are the target pest, that amount will be an amount of the insecticide that is insecticidally effective. An insecticidally effective amount means that amount of insecticide that will kill insect pests in the larvae or pupal state of growth, or will consistently reduce or retard the amount of damage produced by insect pests. In general, the amount of pesticide that is applied to the seed in the treatment will range from about 10 gm to about 2000 gm of the active ingredient of the pesticide per 100 kg of the weight of the seed. Preferably, the amount of pesticide will be within the range of about 50 gm to about 1000 gm active per 100 kg of seed, more preferably within the range of about 100 gm to about 600 gm active per 100 kg of seed, and even more preferably within the range of about 200 gm to about 500 gm of active per 100 kg of seed weight. Alternatively, it has been found to be preferred that the amount of the pesticide be over about 60 gm of the active ingredient of the pesticide per 100 kg of the seed, and more preferably over about 80 gm per 100 kg of seed. The pesticides that are used in the treatment must not inhibit germination of the seed and should be efficacious in protecting the seed and/or the plant during that time in the target insect's life cycle in which it causes injury to the seed or plant. In general, the coating will be efficacious for approximately 0 to 120 days after sowing. The pesticides of the subject invention can be applied to the seed in the form of a coating. As referred to in the present disclosure and claims, "plant" includes members of Kingdom Plantae, particularly seed plants (Spermatopsida), at all life stages, including young plants (e.g., germinating seeds developing into seedlings) and mature, reproductive stages (e.g., plants producing flowers and seeds). Portions of plants include geotropic members typically growing beneath the surface of the growing medium (e.g., soil), such as roots, tubers, bulbs and corms, and also members growing above the growing medium, such as foliage (including stems and leaves), flowers, fruits and seeds. As referred to herein, the term "seedling", used either alone or in a combination of words means a young plant developing from the embryo of a seed. As referred to in this disclosure, the terms "fungal pathogen" and "fungal plant pathogen" include pathogens in the Basidiomycete, Ascomycete, Oomycete and Deuteromycete classes that are the causal agents of a broad spectrum of plant diseases of economic importance, affecting ornamental, turf, vegetable, field, cereal and fruit crops. In the context of this disclosure, "protecting a plant from disease" or "control of a plant disease" includes preventative action (interruption of the fungal cycle of infection, colonization, symptom development and spore production) and/or curative action (inhibition of colonization of plant host tissues). As referred to in this disclosure, the term mode of action (MOA) is as defined broadly by the Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC), and is used to distinguish fungicide groups according to their biochemical mode of action in the biosynthetic pathways of plant pathogens. These FRAC-defined MOAs are (A) nucleic acid synthesis, (B) mitosis and cell division, (C) respiration, (D) amino acid and protein synthesis, (E) signal transduction, (F) lipid synthesis and membrane integrity, (G) sterol biosynthesis in membranes, (H) cell wall biosynthesis in membranes, (I) melanin synthesis in cell wall, (P) host plant defense induction, multi-site contact activity and unknown mode of action. Each MOA class consists of one or more groups based either on individual validated target sites of action, or in cases where the precise target site is unknown, based on cross resistance profiles within a group or in relation to other groups. Each of these groupings within a FRAC-defined MOA, whether the target site is known or unknown, is designated by a FRAC code. Additional information on target sites and FRAC codes can be found on the FRAC website. As referred to in this disclosure, the term "cross resistance" refers to a phenomenon wherein a pathogen evolves resistance to one fungicide and in addition acquires resistance to others. These additional fungicides are typically, but not always, in the same chemical class or have the same target site of action, or can be detoxified by the same mechanism. As referred to in this disclosure, the term "resistance factor" refers to the ratio of ED50 values between resistant and sensitive isolates of a fungal pathogen, where ED50 is the effective dose required to control 50% of the fungal pathogen. For additional information on fungicide resistance see K. J. Brent and Derek W. Hollomon, Fungicide Resistance: The Assessment of Risk, FRAC Monograph No. 2, 2nd ed., 2007. Preferably, fungicidal compounds are useful in treating all plants, plant parts and seeds. Plant and seed varieties and cultivars can be obtained by conventional propagation and breeding methods or by genetic engineering methods. Genetically modified plants or seeds (transgenic plants or seeds) are those in which a heterologous gene (transgene) has been stably integrated into the plant's or seed's genome. A transgene that is defined by its particular location in the plant genome is called a transformation or transgenic event. Genetically modified plant and seed cultivars which can be treated include those that are resistant against one or more biotic stresses (pests such as nematodes, insects, mites, fungi, etc.) or abiotic stresses (drought, cold temperature, soil salinity, etc.), or that contain other desirable characteristics. Plants and seeds can be genetically modified to exhibit traits of, for example, herbicide tolerance, insect-resistance, modified oil profiles or drought tolerance. Useful genetically modified plants and seeds containing single gene transformation events or combinations of transformation events are listed in Table 1A. Additional information for the genetic modifications listed in Table 1 A can be obtained from the following the OECD, the aphis /USDA and gmoinfo databases.

Soybean SYHT04R SYN- Mesotrione tol. Modified avhppd 0004 R-8 Treatment of genetically modified pi a; nts and seeds with fungicidal compounds may result in super-additive or synergistic effects. For example, reduction in application rates, broadening of the activity spectrum, increased tolerance to biotic/abiotic stresses or enhanced storage stability may be greater than expected from just simple additive effects of the application of fungicidal compounds on genetically modified plants and seeds. Fungicidal compounds are useful in seed treatments for protecting seeds from plant diseases. In the context of the present disclosure and claims, treating a seed means contacting the seed with a biologically effective amount of a fungicidal compound, which is typically formulated as a composition with the composition(s) of the invention. This seed treatment protects the seed from soil-borne disease pathogens and generally can also protect roots and other plant parts in contact with the soil of the seedling developing from the germinating seed. The seed treatment may also provide protection of foliage by translocation of the fungicide or a second active ingredient within the developing plant. Seed treatments can be applied to all types of seeds, including those from which plants genetically transformed to express specialized traits will germinate. Representative examples include those expressing proteins toxic to invertebrate pests, such as Bacillus thuringiensis toxin or those expressing herbicide resistance such as glyphosate acetyltransferase, which provides resistance to glyphosate. Seed treatments with herbicidal, fungicdal or insecticidal compounds can also increase vigor of plants growing from the seed. Herbicidal, fungicidal or insecticidal compounds and their compositions, both alone and in combination with additional fungicides, nematicides and insecticides, are particularly useful in seed treatment for crops including, but not limited to, maize or corn, soybeans, cotton, cereal (e.g., wheat, oats, barley, rye and rice), potatoes, vegetables and oilseed rape. Furthermore, fungicidal compounds are useful in treating postharvest diseases of fruits and vegetables caused by fungi and bacteria. These infections can occur before, during and after harvest. For example, infections can occur before harvest and then remain dormant until some point during ripening (e.g., host begins tissue changes in such a way that infection can progress); also infections can arise from surface wounds created by mechanical or insect injury. In this respect, the compounds of this invention can reduce losses (i.e. losses resulting from quantity and quality) due to postharvest diseases which may occur at any time from harvest to consumption. Treatment of postharvest diseases with fungicidal compounds can increase the period of time during which perishable edible plant parts (e.g, fruits, seeds, foliage, stems, bulbs, tubers) can be stored refrigerated or un-refrigerated after harvest, and remain edible and free from noticeable or harmful degradation or contamination by fungi or other microorganisms. Treatment of edible plant parts before or after harvest with fungicidal compounds can also decrease the formation of toxic metabolites of fungi or other microorganisms, for example, mycotoxins such as aflatoxins. Plant disease control is ordinarily accomplished by applying an effective amount of a compound of this invention either pre- or post-infection, to the portion of the plant to be protected such as the roots, stems, foliage, fruits, seeds, tubers or bulbs, or to the media (soil or sand) in which the plants to be protected are growing. The compounds can also be applied to seeds to protect the seeds and seedlings developing from the seeds. The compounds can also be applied through irrigation water to treat plants. Control of postharvest pathogens which infect the produce before harvest is typically accomplished by field application of a compound of this invention, and in cases where infection occurs after harvest the compounds can be applied to the harvested crop as dips, sprays, fumigants, treated wraps and box liners. Rates of application for these compounds (i.e. a fungicidally effective amount) can be influenced by factors such as the plant diseases to be controlled, the plant species to be protected, ambient moisture and temperature and should be determined under actual use conditions. One skilled in the art can easily determine through simple experimentation the fungicidally effective amount necessary for the desired level of plant disease control. Foliage can normally be protected when treated at a rate of from less than about 1 g/ha to about 5,000 g/ha of active ingredient. Seed and seedlings can normally be protected when seed is treated at a rate of from about 0.001 g (more typically about 0.1 g) to about 10 g per kilogram of seed. Fungicidal compounds can also be mixed with one or more other biologically active compounds or agents including fungicides, insecticides, nematocides, bactericides, acaricides, herbicides, herbicide safeners, growth regulators such as insect molting inhibitors and rooting stimulants, chemosterilants, semiochemicals, repellents, attractants, pheromones, feeding stimulants, plant nutrients, other biologically active compounds or entomopathogenic bacteria, virus or fungi to form a multi-component pesticide giving an even broader spectrum of agricultural protection. Thus the present invention also pertains to a composition comprising the compsiitons of the invention, a fungicidal compound (in a fungicidally effective amount) and at least one additional biologically active compound or agent (in a biologically effective amount) and can further comprise at least one of a surfactant, a solid diluent or a liquid diluent. The other biologically active compounds or agents can be formulated in compositions comprising at least one of a surfactant, solid or liquid diluent. For mixtures, one or more other biologically active compounds or agents can be formulated together, to form a premix, or one or more other biologically active compounds or agents can be formulated separately and the formulations combined together before application (e.g., in a spray tank) or, alternatively, applied in succession. Fungicidal compounds and compositions thereof can be applied to plants genetically transformed, such as the pants of the invention, to express in addition to the recombinant constructs of the invention, proteins toxic to invertebrate pests (such as Bacillus thuringiensis delta-endotoxins). The effect of the exogenously applied fungicidal compounds may be synergistic with the expressed toxin proteins. General references for agricultural protectants (i.e. insecticides, fungicides, nematocides, acaricides, herbicides and biological agents) include The Pesticide Manual, 13th Edition, C. D. S. Tomlin, Ed., British Crop Protection Council, Farnham, Surrey, U.K., 2003 and The BioPesticide Manual, 2nd Edition, L. G. Copping, Ed., British Crop Protection Council, Farnham, Surrey, U.K., 2001 . In certain instances, combinations of a fungicidal compound with other biologically active (particularly fungicidal) compounds or agents (i.e. active ingredients) can result in a greater-than-additive (i.e. synergistic) effect. Reducing the quantity of active ingredients released in the environment while ensuring effective pest control is always desirable. When synergism of fungicidal active ingredients occurs at application rates giving agronomically satisfactory levels of fungal control, such combinations can be advantageous for reducing crop production cost and decreasing environmental load. Also in certain instances, combinations of a fungicidal compound with other biologically active compounds or agents can result in a less-than-additive (i.e. safening) effect on organisms beneficial to the agronomic environment. For example, a fungicidal compound may safen a herbicide on crop plants or protect a beneficial insect species (e.g., insect predators, pollinators such as bees) from an insecticide.

Compositions comprising fungicidal compounds useful for seed treatment can further comprise bacteria and fungi that have the ability to provide protection from the harmful effects of plant pathogenic fungi or bacteria and/or soil born animals such as nematodes. Bacteria exhibiting nematicidal properties may include but are not limited to Bacillus firmus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillius subtiliis and Pasteuria penetrans. A suitable Bacillus firmus strain is strain CNCM 1-1582 (GB-126) which is commercially available as BioNemTM A suitable Bacillus cereus strain is strain NCMM 1-1592. Both Bacillus strains are disclosed in US 6,406,690. Other suitable bacteria exhibiting nematicidal activity are B. amyloliquefaciens IN937a and B. subtilis strain GB03. Bacteria exhibiting fungicidal properties may include but are not limited to B. pumilus strain GB34. Fungal species exhibiting nematicidal properties may include but are not limited to Myrothecium verrucaria, Paecilomyces lilacinus and Purpureocillium lilacinum. Seed treatments can also include one or more nematicidal agents of natural origin such as the elicitor protein called harpin which is isolated from certain bacterial plant pathogens such as Erwinia amylovora. An example is the Harpin-N- Tek seed treatment technology available as N-HibitT Gold CST. Seed treatments can also include one or more species of legume-root nodulating bacteria such as the microsymbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria Bradyrhizobium japonicum. These inocculants can optionally include one or more lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs), which are nodulation (Nod) factors produced by rhizobia bacteria during the initiation of nodule formation on the roots of legumes. For example, the Optimize® brand seed treatment technology incorporates LCO Promoter TechnologyT jn combination with an inocculant. Seed treatments can also include one or more isoflavones which can increase the level of root colonization by mycorrhizal fungi. Mycorrhizal fungi improve plant growth by enhancing the root uptake of nutrients such as water, sulfates, nitrates, phosphates and metals. Examples of isoflavones include, but are not limited to, genistein, biochanin A, formononetin, daidzein, glycitein, hesperetin, naringenin and pratensein. Formononetin is available as an active ingredient in mycorrhizal inocculant products such as PHC Colonize® AG. Seed treatments can also include one or more plant activators that induce systemic acquired resistance in plants following contact by a pathogen. An example of a plant activator which induces such protective mechanisms is acibenzolar-S- methyl.

TABLE 1 C Generalized Steps for Soybean Oil and Byproduct Production # 5 water washing soap # 6 Bleaching color, soap, metal # 7 (hydrogenation) # 8 (winterization) stearine free fatty acids, # 9 Deodorization tocopherols, sterols, volatiles # 10 oil products More specifically, soybean seeds are cleaned, tempered, dehulled, and flaked, thereby increasing the efficiency of oil extraction. Oil extraction is usually accomplished by solvent (e.g., hexane) extraction but can also be achieved by a combination of physical pressure and/or solvent extraction. The resulting oil is called crude oil. The crude oil may be degummed by hydrating phospholipids and other polar and neutral lipid complexes that facilitate their separation from the nonhydrating, triglyceride fraction (soybean oil). The resulting lecithin gums may be further processed to make commercially important lecithin products used in a variety of food and industrial products as emulsification and release (i.e., antisticking) agents. Degummed oil may be further refined for the removal of impurities (primarily free fatty acids, pigments and residual gums). Refining is accomplished by the addition of a caustic agent that reacts with free fatty acid to form soap and hydrates phosphatides and proteins in the crude oil. Water is used to wash out traces of soap formed during refining. The soapstock byproduct may be used directly in animal feeds or acidulated to recover the free fatty acids. Color is removed through adsorption with a bleaching earth that removes most of the chlorophyll and carotenoid compounds. The refined oil can be hydrogenated, thereby resulting in fats with various melting properties and textures. Winterization (fractionation) may be used to remove stearine from the hydrogenated oil through crystallization under carefully controlled cooling conditions. Deodorization (principally via steam distillation under vacuum) is the last step and is designed to remove compounds which impart odor or flavor to the oil. Other valuable byproducts such as tocopherols and sterols may be removed during the deodorization process. Deodorized distillate containing these byproducts may be sold for production of natural vitamin E and other high-value pharmaceutical products. Refined, bleached, (hydrogenated, fractionated) and deodorized oils and fats may be packaged and sold directly or further processed into more specialized products. A more detailed reference to soybean seed processing, soybean oil production, and byproduct utilization can be found in Erickson, Practical Handbook of Soybean Processing and Utilization, The American Oil Chemists' Society and United Soybean Board (1995). Soybean oil is liquid at room temperature because it is relatively low in saturated fatty acids when compared with oils such as coconut, palm, palm kernel, and cocoa butter. Plant and microbial oils containing PUFAs that have been refined and/or purified can be hydrogenated, thereby resulting in fats with various melting properties and textures. Many processed fats (including spreads, confectionary fats, hard butters, margarines, baking shortenings, etc.) require varying degrees of solidity at room temperature and can only be produced through alteration of the source oil's physical properties. This is most commonly achieved through catalytic hydrogenation. Hydrogenation is a chemical reaction in which hydrogen is added to the unsaturated fatty acid double bonds with the aid of a catalyst such as nickel. For example, high oleic soybean oil contains unsaturated oleic, linoleic, and linolenic fatty acids, and each of these can be hydrogenated. Hydrogenation has two primary effects. First, the oxidative stability of the oil is increased as a result of the reduction of the unsaturated fatty acid content. Second, the physical properties of the oil are changed because the fatty acid modifications increase the melting point resulting in a semi-liquid or solid fat at room temperature. There are many variables which affect the hydrogenation reaction, which in turn alter the composition of the final product. Operating conditions including pressure, temperature, catalyst type and concentration, agitation, and reactor design are among the more important parameters that can be controlled. Selective hydrogenation conditions can be used to hydrogenate the more unsaturated fatty acids in preference to the less unsaturated ones. Very light or brush hydrogenation is often employed to increase stability of liquid oils. Further hydrogenation converts a liquid oil to a physically solid fat. The degree of hydrogenation depends on the desired performance and melting characteristics designed for the particular end product. Liquid shortenings (used in the manufacture of baking products, solid fats and shortenings used for commercial frying and roasting operations) and base stocks for margarine manufacture are among the myriad of possible oil and fat products achieved through hydrogenation. A more detailed description of hydrogenation and hydrogenated products can be found in Patterson, H. B. W., Hydrogenation of Fats and Oils: Theory and Practice. The American Oil Chemists' Society (1994). Hydrogenated oils have become somewhat controversial due to the presence of frans-fatty acid isomers that result from the hydrogenation process. Ingestion of large amounts of frans-isomers has been linked with detrimental health effects including increased ratios of low density to high density lipoproteins in the blood plasma and increased risk of coronary heart disease. To protect and to enhance yield production and trait technologies, seed treatment options can provide additional crop plan flexibility and cost effective control against insects, weeds and diseases, thereby further enhancing the invention described herein. Seed material can be treated, typically surface treated, with a composition comprising combinations of chemical or biological herbicides, herbicide safeners, insecticides, fungicides, germination inhibitors and enhancers, nutrients, plant growth regulators and activators, bactericides, nematicides, avicides and/or molluscicides. These compounds are typically formulated together with further carriers, surfactants or application-promoting adjuvants customarily employed in the art of formulation. The coatings may be applied by impregnating propagation material with a liquid formulation or by coating with a combined wet or dry formulation. Examples of the various types of compounds that may be used as seed treatments are provided in The Pesticide Manual: A World Compendium, C.D.S. Tomlin Ed., Published by the British Crop Production Council, which is hereby incorporated by reference. In yet another embodiment the seeds of the invention may include seed treatments. Seed treatments that may be used on crop seed include, but are not limited to, one or more of abscisic acid, acibenzolar-S-methyl, avermectin, amitrol, azaconazole, azospirillum, azadirachtin, azoxystrobin, bacillus spp. (including one or more of cereus, firmus, megaterium, pumilis, sphaericus, subtilis and/or thuringiensis), bradyrhizobium spp. (including one or more of betae, canariense, elkanii, iriomotense, japonicum, liaonigense, pachyrhizi and/or yuanmingense), captan, carboxin, chitosan, clothianidin, copper, cyazypyr, difenoconazole, etidiazole, fipronil, fludioxonil, fluquinconazole, flurazole, fluxofenim, harpin protein, imazalil, imidacloprid, ipconazole, isoflavenoids, lipo-chitooligosaccharide, mancozeb, manganese, maneb, mefenoxam, metalaxyl, metconazole, PCNB, penflufen, penicillium, penthiopyrad, permethrine, picoxystrobin, prothioconazole, pyraclostrobin, rynaxypyr, S-metolachlor, saponin, sedaxane, TCMTB, tebuconazole, thiabendazole, thiamethoxam, thiocarb, thiram, tolclofos-methyl, triadimenol, trichoderma, trifloxystrobin, triticonazole and/or zinc. PCNB seed coat refers to EPA registration number 00293500419, containing quintozen and terrazole. TCMTB refers to 2-(thiocyanomethylthio) benzothiazole. Seed varieties and seeds with specific transgenic traits may be tested to determine which seed treatment options and application rates may complement such varieties and transgenic traits in order to enhance yield. For example, a variety with good yield potential but head smut susceptibility may benefit from the use of a seed treatment that provides protection against head smut, a variety with good yield potential but cyst nematode susceptibility may benefit from the use of a seed treatment that provides protection against cyst nematode, and so on. Likewise, a variety encompassing a transgenic trait conferring insect resistance may benefit from the second mode of action conferred by the seed treatment, a variety encompassing a transgenic trait conferring herbicide resistance may benefit from a seed treatment with a safener that enhances the plants resistance to that herbicide, etc. Further, the good root establishment and early emergence that results from the proper use of a seed treatment may result in more efficient nitrogen use, a better ability to withstand drought and an overall increase in yield potential of a variety or varieties containing a certain trait when combined with a seed treatment. A cell of the invention can be part of an oilseed plant, such as, but not limited to, soybean, corn, canola, sunflower, flax, cotton, and safflower.

EXAMPLES The present invention is further illustrated in the following Examples, in which parts and percentages are by weight and degrees are Celsius, unless otherwise stated. It should be understood that these Examples, while indicating embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only. From the above discussion and these Examples, one skilled in the art can ascertain the essential characteristics of this invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, can make various changes and modifications of the invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions.

Such modifications are also intended to fall within the scope of the appended claims. EXAMPLE 1 Identification of Carbonic Anhvdrases from Soy and Arabidopsis Expression of YLDGAT2 in soybean The Yarrowia lipolytica diacylglycerolacyltransferase 2 (YLDGAT2) was described in U.S. Patent No. 7,901 ,928. Cloning of YLDGAT2 into soybean expression vectors under control of the strong, seed-specific soy beta-conglycinin promoter, followed by a phaseolin transcription terminator, was described in U.S. Patent No.s 8,153,859 and 8,399,736 (incorporated herewith by reference). Expression of these vectors in soybean or soybean somatic embryos was shown to lead to higher seed oil content. Using methods described in U.S. Patent No.s 8,153,859 and 8,399,736 a new expression vector (PHP43186; SEQ ID NO: 1 ) was constructed which comprises the YLDGAT2 (nt 5498-7042) under control of the soy beta-conglycinin promoter (nt 4875-5491 ), followed by a phaseolin transcription terminator (7045- 8210). In addition, PHP43186 comprises a soybean acetolactate synthase (als) gene coding region (nt 3392-1437) encoding a mutant ALS enzyme insensitive to sulfonylurea herbicides and having a P178A and W555L mutation in the encoded protein (GM-HRA), under control of the constitutive soy SAMS promoter region (nt 4767-3459) (U.S. Patent No. 7,217,858) and followed by a soy ALS transcription terminator (nt 1436-786). Other regulatory elements present on PHP43186 include an ORF stop with stop codons in all 6 frames (ORFSTOP-A, nt 657-672), a FLP recombinase recognition site FR71 (nt 3407-3454) (U .S. Patent No. 8,293,533) and a FLP recombinase recognition site FR787 (nt 701 -748) (U.S. Patent No. 8,293,533). In addition, sequence 8257-624 is vector backbone containing the T7 promoter (sequence 9542-9445), the hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt) gene coding region (sequence 9444-8404) and the T7 terminator (sequence 8403-8257). PHP4318A (SEQ ID NO:2) was digested with Ascl and the fragment containing YLDGAT2 (SEQ ID NO:33) under control of the soy beta-conglycinin promoter, was purified and used to transform soy as described in U.S. Patent No.s 8,153,859 and 8,399,736. Events from this experiment, called ON57, were selected, plants were regenerated and seed harvested and analyzed for oil content by NMR analysis and fatty acid profile by GC exactly as described in U.S. Patent No.s 8,153,859 and 8,399,736. In this way, a single copy event (called ON57 6925.8.1 .4) was identified having a typical oil increase from overexpression of YLDGAT2 under control of the soy beta-conglycinin promoter. The average percent oil content and average fatty acid profile (reported as wt.% of total fatty acids) for all null T1 seed and all transgenic T1 seed (greater than 18% oleic acid) from event ON57 6925.8.1 .4 is shown in Table 2. In addition, Table 2 shows the change in oil content and fatty acid profile (reported as Delta in Table 2; average value transgenic - average value null) as well as the percent increase or decrease (% Change; (average value transgenic - average value null)/average value null x 100%). TABLE 2 Oil content, protein content and fatty acid profile for null and transgenic T1 seed from event ON57 6925.8.1 .4. T1 seed from event ON57 6925.8.1 .4 was planted and zygosity of plants determined by construct-specific quantitative PCR (qPCR), as described previously in US Patent 8,293,533, issued October 23, 2012. Based on the qPCR results of T1 plants, T2 seed from homozygous and null T1 plants were planted and plants grown as described in U.S. Patent 8,153,859, issued April 10, 2012 and in U.S. Patent 8,399,73, issued March 19, 2013. Flowers from plants were tagged and developing seed was collected at 15 DAF (days after flowering), 30 DAF and 50 DAF. Seed harvested at each time point were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, were ground with a mortar and pestle and the powders were aliquoted into 5 individual reps. In addition, T3 seed was collected from each plant used in the developmental study and analyzed for % Oil, % Protein, fatty acid profile (Wt. % of Total fatty acids) % Stachyose, % Sucrose, % Total Carbohydrate and % Moisture by single seed Near-Infrared Spectroscopy as described in below. NIT Measurements, Data Analysis, and Model Development NIR Spectra, from 850-1050 nm (2-nm step; 30-mm path length), for 400- 500g bulk samples of intact soybeans were acquired in transmission mode using a Foss Tecator AB model 1241 grain analyzer (Hoganas, Sweden) fitted with a standard instrument hopper and sample transport mechanism. Each batch was analyzed in duplicate using 10 subsample scans, which were saved as the average. All data analysis was performed using the InfraSoft International (IS I) chemometrics software WinlSI II v.1 .50e (NIRSystems Inc., Silver Spring, MD, USA). Pre-treatment of the raw NIR (log 1/T) spectral data included multiplicative scatter correction and first derivative transformation over a 4-point (8-nm) gap using a 4-point smoothing function. Predictions of oil and protein content (corrected to a 13% moisture basis) were based on calibration models developed by USDA- FGIS\GIPSA. Calibration models for oleic and linolenic acid were proprietary and were developed in-house using Partial Least-Squares (PLS) regression (Williams and Norris, 1987) utilizing the transformed spectrum captured from material presenting a wide compositional diversity for these two components. The reference chemistry used for the calibrations was developed by gas chromatographic analysis of fatty acid methyl esters of oil extracts derived from the bean samples, after spectral capture. All calibration development work was performed using standardized PLS algorithms within the Win ISI II v.1 .50e software. The optimum number of PLS factors was defined as that number of factors beyond which no further improvement in the Standard Error of Cross-Validation (SECV) was observed. Calculation of the SECV was handled automatically by the WinlSI software. The SECV was obtained by sequentially removing subsets of samples from the calibration set, re-deriving the model and predicting the removed samples in an iterative manner. Six separate cross-validation tests provided the most reliable estimate of calibration accuracy obtainable from the sample set in question. The coefficient of determination (R2), was used to describe the correlation between reference (observed) and NIR-predicted values for the calibration set. The Relative Predictive Determinant (RPD), defined as the ratio of the SD of the reference values to the SECV, was used as a normalized indicator for comparing NIR models where values > 2.0 are generally recognized as sufficient for quantitative measurement (Chang et al., 2001 ). % Oil plus % Protein (% Proil) was calculated by adding the individual measurements together. Results for compositional analysis of T3 seed from event (T2 plants) ON57 6925.8.1 .4 are presented in Table 3. In addition, Table 3 shows the change in content for each species measured (reported as Delta in Table 3; average value transgenic - average value null) as well as the percent increase or decrease (% Change; (average value transgenic - average value null)/average value null x 100%).

Fatty acid relates the individual fatty acid to the sum of the five major fatty acids indicated. 16:0 = palmitic acid, 18:0 = stearic acid, 18:1 = oleic acid, 18:2 = linoleic acid, 18:3 = linolenic acid. Prot=protein, proil=protein + oil, stach=stachyose, suc=sucrose, tcrb=total carbohydrate, ms=moisture. Hz=homozygous. Avg=average. All components are expressed in %. RNA quantification (RNA SEQ) Total RNAs were isolated from ground frozen tissue with RNeasy (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA ) according to manufacture protocols. Total RNAs were analyzed for quality and quantity with the Agilent Bioanalyzer RNA Nano kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and normalized to 1 ug input per sample. Sequencing libraries were prepared according to llllumina Inc. (San Diego, CA) TruSeq mRNA-Seq protocols. Messenger RNAs were isolated via attachment to oligo (dT) beads, fragmented and reverse transcribed into cDNA by random hexamer prime with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). Resulting cDNAs were end repairs, 3 prime A-tailed, and ligated with lllumina indexed TruSeq adapters. Ligated cDNA fragments were PCR amplified with lllumina TruSeq primers, purified with AmpureXP Beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics, Danvers, MA), and checked for quality and quantity with the Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA 7500 kit. Libraries were combined into twelve sample pools and pools were normalized to 2nM. Each pool was denatured according to lllumina sequencing protocols, hybridized and clustered on one flowcell lane using the lllumina cBot. Single-end fifty base sequences and seven base index sequences were generated on the HiSeq 2000 according to lllumina protocols. Data was trimmed for quality with a minimum threshold of Q20 and resulting sequences were split by index identifier. Sequences were aligned uniquely to the Glymal gene models v1 .1 via the Bowtie algorithm. Resulting per sample alignments were counted and normalized to Relative Parts Per Ten Million reads (RPKtM) (Mortazavi et al 2008). Table 4 shows that expression of Glyma02g37710 and Glyma08g39510 is significantly increased in developing seed expressing YLDGAT2, especially at 50 DAF. These 2 genes encode proteins with similarity to carbonic anhydrase enzymes with inferred localization in plastids. TABLE 4 Expression analysis for null and transgenic homozygous seed expressing YLDGAT2 at 15. 30 and 50 DAF 1DAF =days after flowering 2TG=Transgenic 3ProbT= significance level Analysis of silique gene expression in transgenic Arabidopsis events with increased seed oil content US patent 8,404,926, describes transgenic Arabidopsis events with increased oil content due to seed-preferred expression of the maize ODP1 transcription factor. Specifically said patent describes one event (C00536) with seed specific (Soy betaconglycinin promoter-driven) overexpression of Zm-ODP1 and three events (36162, 36180 and 36181 ) in which expression of said gene is under control of the Arabidopsis SUS2 promoter. Comparative analysis of gene expression in developing siliques in response to presence of the maize ODP1 transcription factor was performed as follows. Briefly, 24 transgenic plants were grown alongside 12 wild type (wt) plants in the same flats in a total of three biological replicates. Green siliques were harvested 21 days after planting in soil, pooled by genotype and total silique RNA was isolated. Hence two RNA samples were generated from every flat (biological rep). Additional flats planted from identical seed sources were allowed to grow to maturity and oil content of mature, dry seed was determined by NMR. There was at least a 1 .2 % point increase in seed oil content when transgenic plants expressing the maize ODP1 transcription factor were compared to null plants grown in the same flat. Total RNA was isolated and subjected to comparative transcriptome sequencing using a MiSeq Desktop Sequencer (lllumina, San Diego, CA USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Table 5 shows that expression of AT4G33580 is significantly increased in developing siliques of all events with seed preferred expression of ZM-ODP1 . AT4G33580 encodes a gene encoding a protein with similarity to carbonic anhydrase enzymes with inferred localization in plastids. TABLE 5 Gene expression of AT4G33580 in developing siliques of Arabidopsis plants EXAMPLE 2 Cloning Arabidopsis and Sov Carbonic Anhvdrases Into Soybean Expression Vectors And Co-Expression With Diacylqlvcerolacyltransferase (DGAT) Arabidopsis Carbonic Anhydrase (At-BCA5): A full-length-enriched Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library, atgrl c, derived from root and shoot tissue was prepared, cDNA clones were sequenced and the sequences were analyzed by Blast as described in U.S. Patent No. 7,157,621 . The full-length sequence of cDNA clone atgrl c. pk095.a9, identified as a beta carbonic anhydrase 5 (AT4G33580) as described in Example 1 , is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 3. The coding sequence from clone atgrl c. pk095.a9 is shown in SEQ ID NO: 4 and the encoded amino acid sequence is shown in SEQ ID NO:5. DNA was prepared from an aliquot of clone atgrl c. pk095.a9 using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol . Notl restriction sites were added to the ends of At-BCA5 by PCR- amplification using oligonucleotides oBCA5-1 (SEQ ID NO: 6) and OBCA5-2 (SEQ ID NO: 7) with the PHUSION™ High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Cat. No. F553S, Finnzymes Oy, Finland), following the manufacturer's protocol. The sequence of the PCR product was identical to that expected from the sequence of atgr1 c.pk095.19. The Yarrowia lipolytica diacylglycerolacyltransferase 2 (YLDGAT2) was described in U.S. Patent No. 7,901 ,928. The cloning of YLDGAT2 into soybean expression vectors under control of the strong, seed-specific beta-conglycinin promoter, where expression in soybean or soybean somatic embryos leads to higher oil was described in U.S. Patent No.s 8,153,859 and 8,399,736. Using methods familiar to one skilled in the art, the Notl fragment containing At-BCA5 was cloned into a soybean expression vector containing the strong, seed specific soy albumin promoter (WO2000040710, published July 13, 2000), and containing the YLDGAT2 under control of the soy beta-conglycinin promoter, to give pKR2559 (SEQ ID NO: 8). Soy Carbonic Anhydrase (GM-CA): A cDNA library, s2, derived from Soybean (Glycine max L.) seed, Stage was prepared, cDNA clones were sequenced and the sequences were analyzed by Blast as described in U.S. Patent No. 7,157,621 . A full length cDNA clone s2.15f08, identified as a chloroplastic-like carbonic anhydrase as described in Example 1 , corresponds to Glyma08g39510. The predicted coding sequence for Glyma08g39510 is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 9. The gene from s2.15f08 was given the designation GM-CA. DNA was prepared from an aliquot of s2.15f08 using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol . Notl restriction sites were added to the ends of GM-CA by PCR-amplification using oligonucleotides SA542 (SEQ ID NO: 10) and SA539 (SEQ ID NO: 1 1 ) with the "Platinum"-brand Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies), following the manufacturer's protocol. The CDS from the resulting PCR product was sequenced and the sequence for GM-CA is identical to that of Glyma08g39510 (SEQ ID NO: 9) with the corresponding amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 12. Using methods familiar to one skilled in the art, the Notl fragment containing GM-CA was cloned into a soybean expression vector containing the strong, seed specific soy albumin promoter, and containing the YLDGAT2 under control of the soy beta-conglycinin promoter, to give pKR2495 (SEQ ID NO: 13). Soy Carbonic Anhydrase 2 (GM-CA2): A cDNA library, slsl c, derived from Soybean (Glycine max L, S1990) leaf tissue was prepared, cDNA clones were sequenced and the sequences were analyzed by Blast as described in U.S. Patent No. 7,157,621 . A full length cDNA clone slsl c. pk008.a22, identified as a carbonic anhydrase as described in Example 1 , corresponds to Glyma02g37710. The predicted coding sequence for Glyma02g37710 is set forth in SEQ ID NO: 14. The gene from slsl c. pk008.a22 was given the designation GM-CA2. DNA was prepared from an aliquot of slsl c. pk008.a22 using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Notl restriction sites were added to the ends of GM-CA by PCR-amplification using oligonucleotides oCA2-1 (SEQ ID NO: 15) and oCA2-1 (SEQ ID NO: 16) the PHUSION™ High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Cat. No. F553S, Finnzymes Oy, Finland), following the manufacturer's protocol. The CDS from the resulting PCR product was sequenced and the sequence for GM-CA2 is identical to that of Glyma02g37710 (SEQ ID NO: 14) with the corresponding amino acid sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 17. Using methods familiar to one skilled in the art, the Notl fragment containing GM-CA2 was cloned into a soybean expression vector containing the strong, seed specific soy albumin promoter, with a soy albumin transcription terminator and containing the YLDGAT2 under control of the soy beta-conglycinin promoter, to give pKR2537 (SEQ ID NO: 18). EXAMPLE 3 Co-expressing YLDGAT2 with At-BCA5, GM-CA or GM-CA2 in soybean somatic embryos Plasmid pKR1256 (SEQ ID NO:19) having YLDGAT2 under control of the strong, seed-specific beta-conglycinin promoter and having a hygromycin selectable marker for expression in soy somatic embryos was described in U.S. Patent No.s 8,153,859 and 8,399,736. In the following experiments, pKR1256 was used as a control to assess the concentration of oil produced in soy somatic embryos when YLDGAT2 alone was expressed. DNA from plasmids pKR1256 (YLDGAT only, SEQ ID NO:19), pKR2559 (YLDGAT2+At-BCA5, SEQ ID NO:8), pKR2495 (YLDGAT2+GM-CA, SEQ ID NO:13) or pKR2537 (YLDGAT2+GM-CA2, SEQ ID NO:18) was prepared for particle bombardment into soybean embryogenic suspension culture and transformed exactly as described previously in WO 2008/147935, published December 4, 2008. Soybean embryogenic suspension culture was initiated, grown, maintained and bombarded and events were selected and matured on SHaM media also exactly as described (WO 2008/147935, published December 4, 2008). Three separate experiments were carried out comparing soy somatic embryos transformed with pKR1256 or pKR2495, two experiments were carried out comparing soy somatic embryos transformed with pKR1256 or pKR2559 and one experiment was carried out comparing soy somatic embryos transformed with pKR1256 with pKR2537. A summary of genes, plasmids and model system experiment ("MSE") numbers is shown in Table 6.

EXAMPLE 4 Cloning Arabidopsis and Sov Carbonic Anhvdrases Into Soybean Expression Vectors And Co-Expression With Sov Ovule Development Protein (GM-ODP1 ) or Maize Ovule Development Protein (ZM-ODP1 ) The cloning the corn (ZM-ODP1 ) and soy (GM-ODP1 ) ovule development protein (ODP) genes under control of the soy sucrose synthase promoter, where expression in soybean or soybean somatic embryos leads to higher oil, was described in PCT WO2013096562. Specifically, soybean expression pKR1971 , comprising the GM-ODP1 under control of the soy sucrose synthase promoter, and pKR21 14, comprising the ZM-ODP1 under control of the soy sucrose synthase promoter were described. Using methods familiar to one skilled in the art, the Notl fragment containing GM-CA was cloned into a soybean expression vector containing the strong, seed specific soy albumin promoter (WO2000040710), with a soy albumin transcription terminator, to give pKR2609 (SEQ ID NO: 20). Using methods familiar to one skilled in the art, a DNA fragment comprising the soy sucrose synthase promoter (as described in PCT/US12/70828) driving expression of GM-ODP1 , with a legumin transcription terminator, was cloned into pKR2609, comprising the GM-CA under control of the soy albumin promoter, to give pKR2749 (SEQ ID NO: 21 ). Similarly, a DNA fragment comprising the soy sucrose synthase promoter driving expression of ZM-ODP1 , with a legumin transcription terminator, was cloned into pKR2609, comprising the GM-CA under control of the soy albumin promoter, to give pKR2748 (SEQ ID NO: 22). DNA from plasmids pKR2609 (SEQ ID NO: 20), comprising the GM-CA alone, pKR1971 , comprising the GM-ODP1 alone, pKR21 14, comprising the ZM- ODPI alone, pKR2749 (SEQ ID NO: 21 ), comprising the GM-ODP1 with the GM- CA, pKR2748 (SEQ ID NO: 22), comprising the ZM-ODP1 with the GM-CA and pKR278 (a plasmid containing no genes but having the hygromycin selectable marker as a negative control), was prepared for particle bombardment into soybean embryogenic suspension culture and transformed exactly as described previously in PCT Publication No. WO 2008/147935. Soybean embryogenic suspension culture was initiated, grown, maintained and bombarded and events were selected and matured on SHaM media also exactly as described in PCT Publication No. WO 2008/147935.

The Gas123hp-2 was cloned into a cassette comprising the Kunitz soybean Trypsin Inhibitor (KTi) promoter (Jofuku et al., Plant Cell 1 :1079 1093 (1989)) and the KTi 3' termination region, the isolation of which is described in U.S. Patent No. 6,372,965, followed by the soy albumin transcription terminator, which was previously described in PCT Publication No. WO 2004/071467. DNA fragments comprising the soy albumin promoter driving expression of the GM-CA with the soy albumin transcription terminator and the soy beta- conglycinin promoter driving expression of YLDGAT2 with the phaseolin transcription terminator were described herein. The yeast FLP/FRT site specific recombination system has been shown to function in plants. Earlier, the system was utilized for excision of unwanted DNA. See, Lyznik et al. (1993) Nucleic Acid Res. 21 :969-975. Subsequently, non- identical FRTs were used for the exchange, targeting, arrangement, insertion and control of expression of nucleotide sequences into the plant genome (PCT Publication No. WO1999025821 ; PCT Publication No. WO1999025840; PCT Publication No. W01999025854; PCT Publication No. 1999025855; and PCT Publication No. WO200701 1733; the contents of all are herein incorporated by reference). Constructs and methods for FLP/FRT site specific recombination to achieve recombinase mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) for stacking gene cassettes in soy was previously described in US Pat No. 8,293, 533( the contents of which are herein incorporated by reference). Using standard PCR and cloning methods by one skilled in the art, the following DNA elements were assembled to produce a 161 1 1 bp basic donor construct PHP70086 (SEQ ID NO: 24). Sequence 1903-1950 of PHP70086 (SEQ ID NO: 24) is a FLP recombinase recognition site FRT1 (described previously in US Pat No. 8,293,533). Sequence 1965-3920 is the soybean acetolactate synthase (a/s) gene coding region encoding a mutant ALS enzyme insensitive to sulfonylurea herbicides and having a P178S mutation in the encoded protein. Sequence 3937-4247 is the potato proteinase II inhibitor gene (PINII) terminator. Sequence 4283-4298 is a sequence of DNA comprising ORF stop codons in all 6 frames (ORFSTOP-A). Sequence 4301 -5470 is the phaseolin transcription terminator. Sequence 5475-8817 is the soy beta- ::YLDGAT2: phaseolin transcription terminator cassette. Sequence 8876-10953 is the soy albumin promoter: :GM-CA::soy albumin transcription terminator cassette. Sequence 10985-15265 is the soy Kunitz Trypsin inhibitor 3 (KTi3) promoter::Gas123hp-2::KTi3::albumin transcription terminator cassette. Sequence 15316-15332 is a sequence of DNA comprising ORF stop codons in all 6 frames (ORFSTOP-B). Sequence 15408-15455 is a FLP recombinase recognition site FRT87. Sequence 15409-1902 is vector backbone (described previously in BB1626) containing the T7 promoter (sequence 601 -696), the hygromycin phosphotransferase (hpt) gene coding region (sequence 697-1722) and the T7 terminator (sequence 1744-1876). FLP recombinase expression plasmid (PHP44664) The construction of the 4860 bp FLP recombinase expression plasmid was described previously in US patent 8,293,533. Transformation into soy SSI target events Transgenic SSI target events were produced with the target DNA fragment QC288A as described previously in US patent 8,293,533. One target event described in US patent 8,293,533, 4729.5.1 , also called the "A" line, was chosen to be re-transformed. Target line A contains a well characterized cassette from QC288A having frt1 and frt87 recombination sites with the constitutive SCP1 promoter upstream of the frtl site. Suspension cultures were initiated from developing embryos from homozygous plants of target line A using methods described previously in US patent 8,293,533. Target line A cultures were retransformed with the donor construct PHP70086 (SEQ ID NO: 24 and the FLP recombinase construct using intact plasmid at a 9:3 pg/bp/prep ratio with the biolistic bombardment transformation protocol described herein and using 90 ng/ml chlorsulfuron (DuPont, Wilmington, DE, USA) as the selection agent. The experiment name given for this transformation was SoiM 16. SoiM 16 events created through RMCE bring the promoter-less als(P178S) coding region of donor construct PHP70086 (SEQ ID NO: 24) downstream of the scp^ promoter of QC288A in target line A for expression and thus chlorsulfuron resistance. The frtl and frt87 sites from Target line A recombine with those in plasmid PHP70086 (SEQ ID NO: 24) in a successful recombination mediated cassette exchange (RMCE). EXAMPLE 5B Analysis of soybean plants co-expressing YLDGAT2, GM-CA and seed-targeted silencing of galactinol synthase genes Site specific integration donor plasmid PHP50573, comprising YLDGAT2 under control of the strong, seed-preferred soy beta-conglycinin promoter and fad3 and galactinol synthase gene silencing cassettes, was previously described in PCT Publication No. WO2015/017510. The creation and characterization of soybean Soil19 events created through Recombinase-Mediated Cassette Exchange (RMCE) using PHP50573 was also described in PCT Publication No. WO2015/017510. TO plants generated with donor construct PHP70086 (SEQ ID NO:24) were grown under greenhouse conditions. MatureTI seeds were harvested and analyzed by near-infrared spectroscopy as described in Example 1 . Transgenic T1 seeds of event SOY4139.1 1 .3 were identified based on the increased oleic acid content associated with expression of YL DGAT2 and named Soil 1 16. T2 seeds of a transgenic line heterozygous for an event (AFS8377.1 .2) generated with PHP50573 in the target site for site-specific insertion site that was also used in the SOIL1 16 experiment were analyzed in a similar fashion. TABLE 19 Soil 1 16 (SOY 4139.1 1 .3) Oil Protein Pro + Oil TG 23.83 39.53 63.36 null 20.32 37.78 58.10 change % pts 3.51 1.75 5.26 Table 19 shows that there is a greater increase in oil in protein content in experiment SOIL 1 16 compared to SOIL 19 which demonstrates that expression of plastidic carbonic anhydrase adds to the increase of seed protein and oil content associated with expression of DGAT proteins.
