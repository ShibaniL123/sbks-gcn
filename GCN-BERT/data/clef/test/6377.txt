DESCRIPTION ANTITUMOR AGENT INCLUDING IRINGTECAN HYDROCHLORIDE HYDRATI Technical Field [0001] The present invention relates to an antitumour agent using a trifluridine/tipiracil hydrochloride combination drug in combination with irinotecan hydrochloride hydrate, and to an enhancer for the antitumor effect of irinotecan hydrochloride hydrate. Background Art [0002] Trifluridine (also called: α,α,oc-trifluorothymidine. Hereinafter, also referred to as "FTD") exerts an antitumor effect due to an action for inhibiting thymidylate formation and an action for inhibiting DMA synthesis by incorporation into DNA. On the other hand, tipiracil hydrochloride (chemical name : 5-chloro-6-[(2-iminopyrrolidin-l-yl)methyl]-pyrimidine-2,4( 1Η,3Η)-dione hydrochloride. Hereinafter, also referred to as "TPI") has an action for inhibiting thymidine phosphorylase. It is known that the antitumor effect of FTD is enhanced by the TPI suppressing the degradation of FTD in vivo causedby thymidine phosphorylase (Patent Literature 1) . Currently, an antitumor agent containing FTD and TPI in a molar ratio of 1: 0.5 (hereinafter referred to as "FTD/TPI combination drug") is under development as a therapeutic agent tor solid cancers, for example, colorectal cancer (Non Patent Literatures 1 and 2). [0003] Further, irinotecan hydrochloride hydrate (hereinafter, also referred to as "CPT-11") is a camptothecin derivative whose active metabolite is SN-38 and which suppresses the synthesis and transcription of DNA by inhibiting topoi some rase I, thereby to exert an antitumor effect. CPT-11 is clinically used as a therapeutic agent for a wide range of cancer types including, for example, small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, and malignant lymphoma (Non Patent Literature 3). Further, when FTD and SN-38 were allowed to act on a colorectal cancer cell line, a synergistic cytotoxicity was observed and thus a combination therapy using an FTD/TPI combination drug and CPT-11 has been expected (Non Patent Literature 4).

[0007] In view of this situation, when a combination therapy comprising repeating a 28-day cycle consisting of two times of 5-days' administration with 2-days' rest of an FTD/TPI combination drug, followed by rest of the drug administration for 2 weeks, and an administratioi C 1 once in 2 weeks was performed in a colorectal cancer patient on the basis of an administration schedule in which effects of each drug have ρ r ℮ ν i ο u s 1 y b e e η r e ρ ο r t e d a s i η R e f ℮ r e η c e Ε χ amp 1 ℮ d e s c r i b ℮ d 1 a t. e r, only about 30% of the predetermined amount of CPT-11 could be administered because side effects appeared strongly. Since antitumor effect is generally proportional to the total dose, the present inventors have studied on administration schedule which can suppress the occurrence of side effects and in which a predetermined amount can be administered. As a result, the present inventors have found that a combination therapy comprising repeating one cycle administration schedule, in which, in aperiodof 14 days, an FTD/TPI combination drug is administered to a solid cancer patient (particularly colorectal cancer patient) for 5 days, followed by rest of the drug administration for 9 days, andCPT-11 is administered once in 2 weeks, can suppress the occurrence of side effects, for example, neutropenia, diarrhea and body weight loss, can administer a predetermined amount and exert an excellent antitumor effects.

Fig. 5 is a graph illustrating a body weight change and an incidence of diarrhea according to an administration schedule (2) . De s criρ11οη ο t Embοd1ment s [0012] FTD and TPI of the present invention are both known compounds and can be synthesized, for example, according to the method described in WO 96/3034 6. A combination drug of FTD and TPI in a molar ratio of 1: 0.5 is also known (Non Patent Literatures 1 and 2). CPT-11 of the present invention is a known compound and can be synthesized according to the method described in Japanese Patent No . 3, 004, 077 . Also, the commercially available product, for example, CAMPTO (registered trademark, Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd.), may be used. [0013] The antitumor agent of the present invention is characterized in that one cycle of an administration schedule, in which, in a period of 14 days, a combination drug comprising FTD and TPI in a molar ratio of 1:0.5 is administered on Days 1 to 5 and irinotecan hydrochloride hydrate is administered on Day 1, is repeated once or twice or more times. As shown inReference Example andExamples describedbelow, when the recommended dose of FTD/TPI combination drug in the monotherapy in mice and the recommended dose of CPT-11 in the monotherapy in mice were administered in combination to mice in accordance with the administration schedule, superiorantitumor effects as well as suppression of side effects could be achieved. Thus, it is clear that the dose of FTD/TPI combination drug and CPT-11 in humans according to the administration schedule of the present invention is equivalent to the recommended dose of FTD/TPI combination drug and CPT-11 in humans in the monotherapy. In other words, the dose of FTD on Days 1 to 5 is 20 to 80 mg/nt/day, and from the viewpoint of a balance between antitumor effects and side effects, the preferably 4 0 to 7 0 mg/m2/day, especial.' dose of FTD is more y ρ r ℮ f e r a b 1 y 7 0 mg/m2/day. The dose of CPT-ll on Day 1 is 50 to 200 mg/mz/day using a reduced amount of irinotecan hydrochloride hydrate, and from the viewpoint of a balance between antitumor effects and side effects, the dose of CPT-ll is preferably 100 to 180 mg/mV day, more preferably 150 to 180 mg/m2/day, especially preferably 180 mg/m2/day. The target of the antitumor agent of the present invention is directed to solid tumors, including specifically head and neck cancer, gastrointestinal cancer (esophageal cancer, gastric cancer, duodenal cancer, liver cancer, biliary tract cancer (gallbladder/bile duct cancer) , pancreatic cancer , small intestinal cancer, large intestinal cancer (colorectal cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer) , etc.), lung cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer (cervical cancer, endometrial cancer), renal cancer, bladder cancer, prostate cancer, etc. Of these, from the viewpoint of antitumor effects and side effects, the target of the antitumor agent of the present invention is preferably gastrointestinal cancer, lung cancer, or breast cancer, more preferably colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer, or breast cancer, more preferably colorectal cancer and gastric cancer, and especially preferably colorectal cancer. Here, the solid cancer includes not only a primary tumor but also a tumor derived from a solid cancer that has metastasized to other organs (such as liver) . Also, the antitumor agent of the present invention may be one used for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy that is performed for preventing the recurrence after having extracted the tumor surgically. Since the administration schedule is different in each active ingredient, all the active ingredients cannot be formulated into one dosage form. Thus, the antitumor agent of the present invention is separately formulated into a plurality of dosage forms for each active ingredient. It is preferred that FID and TPI are formulated as a combination drug and CPT-11 is formulated as a single agent. [0016] In addition, as long as each active ingredient is administered according to the administration schedule of the present invention, each preparation may be manufactured and sold together in a single package suitable for combined administration, or each preparation may be manufactured and sold after being divided into a separate package. [0017] There is no particular limitation to the dosage form of the antitumor agent of the present invention, and it can be appropriately selected depending on the therapeutic purposes and includes specifically oral preparations (tablets, coated tablets, powders, granules, capsules, solutions, etc,), injections, suppositories, patches, ointments, etc. An oral preparation is preferable for the combination drug of FTD and TPI, and an injectable preparation is preferable for CPT-11. [0018] Depending on the dosage form, the antitumor agent of the present invention can be usually prepared by the known method using a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such a carrier includes various ones which are commonly used in conventional drugs, such as excipients, binders, disintegrators, lubricants, diluents, solubilizers, suspending agents, isotonic agents, ρη adjusting agents, buffering agents, stabilizers, coloring agents, flavoring agents, and flavors. [0019] The present invention also relates to an antitumor effect enhancer comprising an FTD/TPI combination drug for enhancing the antitumor effect of CPT-11 in a solid cancer patient (especially colorectal cancer patient), wherein the FTD/TPI combination drug and CPT-11 are administered on the basis of the administration schedule described above. The antitumor effect enhancer has the dosage form of the above antitumor agent. [0020] In addition, the present invention relates to an antitumor agent comprising an FTD/TPI combination drug for treating a caηcer ρatieηt (especia11y cο1οrecta1 caηcer ρatieηt) whο has received CPT-11, wherein the FTD/TPI combination drug and CPT-11 are administered on the basis of the administration schedule described above . The antitumor agent has the above dosage form. [0021] Further, the present invention relates to a ki t preparation comprising an FTD/TPI combination drug and an instruction for use teaching that the FTD/TPI combination drug and CPT-11 are to be administered based on the administration schedule . Here, the term "instruction for use" may be any one as long as it describes the administration schedule; however, an instruction for use, in which the administration schedule is recommended though legal binding force does not matter, is preferable. The instruction for use includes specifically a package insert, a pamphlet, etc. Also, a kit preparation comprising an instruction for use may be one in which an instruction for use is printed on or attached to the package of the kit preparation, or may be one in which an antitumor agent together with an instruction for use is enclosed in a package of the kit ρ r e ρ a r a t i ο η. EXAMPLES Then, the present invention is explained in more detail by way of Examples. Reference Example Cultured cells (1 χ 10' cells/mouse) of human colon cancer cell line (KM20C) were intraperitonea.ilγ transplanted into 5-6 weeks old BALB/cA Jcl-nu mice after birth, and the mice were assigned to each group so that the mean body weight of each group became equal. The date on which such grouping (η=10) was performed was taken as Day 0. An FTD/TPI combination drug (a mixture of FTD and TPI in a molar ratio of 1:0.5) was prepared so as to be 75, 100, 150, 300, and 450 mg/kg/day as FTD. Since a death case of irinotecan hydrochloride hydrate (CPT-11: CAMPTO (registered trademark) infusion, Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd.) at a dose of 111 mg/kg/day 'was reported (Kiso to Rinsho, (1990) , Vol. 24, No. 14, 7-17) , irinotecan hydrochloride hydrate was prepared so as to be 80 and 100 mg/kg/day. Starting the dug administration from Day 3, a 5-days' daily oral administration of the FTD/TPI combination drug with 2-days' rest was performed for 6 weeks, and CPT-11 was administered once in a week from the tail vein for 6 weeks . As an index of the antitumor effect, the number of survivors of each group of mice and the survival time of each group was compared. The results are shown in Table 1.

ILS(%) = [(mean survival time of treatment group) / (mean survival time of control group)- As described in Table 1, since the 100 mg/kg/day administration group of CPT-11 had a long life span in mice, the recommended dose (RD) of CPr.-11 in mice was 100 mg/kg/day. Thus, the dose of 100 mg/kg/day in mice is equivalent to RD of 150 to 180 mg/mV day in humans Since life span is long in the administration group of 150 mg/kg/day of the FTD/TPI combination drug using a reduced amount of FTD, RD of the FTD/TPI combination drug in mice is 150 mg/kg/day using a reduced amount of FTD, Thus, the dose of 150 mg/kg/day (using a reduced amount of FTD) in mice is equivalent to RD of 70 mg/m2/day in humans. [0027] Human colon cancer cell lines (KM20C) were transplanted into the right chest of 5-6 weeks old BALB/cA Jcl-nu mice after birth. After tumor transplant, the major axis (mm) and minor axis (mm) of tumor were measured, and the tumor volume (TV) was calculated. Then, the animals were assigned to each group so that the mean TV of each group becomes equal and the day when grouping (η=6) was performed was taken as Day 0. An FTD/TPI combination drug (a mixture of FTD and TPI in a molar ratio of 1:0.5) was prepared so as to be 150 mg/kg/day as FTD, Irinotecan hydrochloride hydrate (CPT-11: CAMPTO (registered trademark) infusion, Yakult Honshu Co,, Ltd.) was prepared so as to be 100 mg /kg/ day as irinotecan hydrochloride hydrate. In the administration schedule (1), the FTD/TPI combination drug was orally administered daily on Days 1-5 and on Days 8-12, and CPT-11 was administered via the tail vein on Days 1 and 15. In the administration schedule (2) , the FTD/TPI combination drug was orally administered daily on Days 1-5 and on Days 15-19, and CPT-11 was administered via the tail vein on Days 1 and 15. The FTD/TPI combination drug and CPT-11 in the monotherapy group were respectively administered at the same dose as the corresponding drugs according to the administration schedule in the combined administration group (Fig. 1). [0028] As an index of the antitumor effect, TV at Day 2 9 in each group was calculated and the relative tumor volume (RTV) at Day 0 was determined by the following formula and compared to RTV of the untreated group (control) , Evaluation judgment on the combination effects was made as effective in the case where the mean RTV values of the combined administration group were statistically significantly lower (Welch'sIUT, over all maximum ρ <0.05) than the mean RTV values of the individual monotherapy group. The results are shown in Figs, 2 and 4. In the Figs, if the p-value is 0.05 or less, it shows that a statistically significant difference was observed in the monotherapy group. [ 0 02 91 TV (mm/) = (long axis χ (short axis)z) /2 RTV = (TV on Day 29)/(TV on Day 0) [0030] In addition, the body weight (JBW) was measured as an index of toxicity over time, the mean body weight change [BWC (%)] on Day η to the body weight on Day 0 was calcul a ted by the fol lowing formula (η indicates the day when the body weight is measured twice in a week and the final measurement day corresponds to Day 29 that is the final evaluation day), and diarrhea was simultaneously observed in the individual mice during the test period. The results are shown in Figs. 3 and 5. [0031] From the results of Figs. 2 to 5, it was revealed that the administration schedule (2) dramatically improved side effects such as body weight loss and diarrhea while maintaining the antitumor effects, in comparison with the administration schedule (1). Example 2 A combined administration test of an FTD/TPI combination drug and CPT-11 was performed in the same manner as in Example 1, except that the cell line was changed to human gastric cancer cell line (SC-2) . The FTD/TPI combination drug (a mixture of FTD and TPI in a molar ratio of 1:0.5) was prepared so as to be 75 and 150 mg/kg/day (recommended dose) as FTD, and CPT-11 was prepared so as to be 100 mg/kg/day (recommended dose) as irinotecan hydrochloride hydrate. The results are shown in Table 2.
