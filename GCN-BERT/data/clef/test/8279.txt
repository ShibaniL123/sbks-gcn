BACKGROUND OF INVENTION 1. Field of Invention The present invention relates to a mop and, more particularly, to a spin-dryable mop. 2. Related Prior Art A spin-dryable mop is different from a conventional mop in that a spin-dryable mop can be spin-dried according to the centrifugal effect that is used in a spin-dryer. A spin-dryable mop can be found in Patent GB235684, “Improvements in and relating to Mops. Another spin-dryable mop is used with a bucket equipped with a spin-drying mechanism. Such a combination can be found in Chinese Patent No. 201220668933.4. However, a bucket equipped with a spin-drying mechanism must be produced for every such spin-dryable mop. A lot of resources in labor and materials are consumed, and impose a heavy financial burden on customers. The present invention is therefore intended to obviate or at least alleviate the problems encountered in prior art. SUMMARY OF INVENTION It is the primary objective of the present invention to provide a convenient spin-dryable mop. To achieve the foregoing objectives, the spin-dryable mop includes a handle, a spinning mechanism, a locking mechanism, a spin-drying mechanism and a mop head. The handle includes an upper tube and a lower tube. The upper tube receives the lower tube. The spinning mechanism movably connects the upper tube to the lower tube. The spinning mechanism rotates the upper tube relative to the lower tube when the upper tube is moved axially relative to the lower tube. The locking mechanism includes a sleeve and a quick-release. The sleeve is secured to the upper tube and located at a place where the upper tube is connected to the lower tube. The sleeve includes an opening. The quick-release is connected to the sleeve in the opening. The quick-release includes a cam extending through the opening to press the lower tube to keep the upper tube in position relative to the lower tube. The spin-drying mechanism includes a shelter and a net. The net movably receives the lower tube, wherein the shelter rotationally receives the net. The mop head is connected to a lower end of the lower tube. In use, the quick-release of the locking mechanism is used to keep the upper tube in position relative to the lower tube and keep the spin-drying mechanism in position relative to the upper tube. Thus, the spin-dryable mop can be used to mop or washed. To spin-dry the spin-dryable mop, the quick-release of the locking mechanism is operated to allow the upper tube to move relative to the lower tube, and the spin-drying mechanism is moved downwards so that the net completely covers the mop head. A user uses one hand to hold the shelter and the other hand to move the upper tube downwards. The lower tube is rotated because of the spinning mechanism. The mop head is rotated with the net. Then, the upper tube is moved upwards back into the original position. This, process is repeated to cast water from the mop head because of the centrifugal effect. Then, the water travels downwards along the shelter and falls into a bucket, sink or any other proper place. In another aspect, the spinning mechanism includes a cap, a screw, a driving element and a collar. The cap is inserted in and secured to the upper tube. The screw is secured to a lower face of the cap. The driving element movably receives the screw. The driving element includes a first ratchet at a lower end. The collar is inserted in and secured to the lower tube. The collar includes a cavity. The driving element is inserted in the cavity. The screw extends through the collar. The collar includes a second ratchet corresponding to the first ratchet. When the upper tube is moved downwards, the screw moves downwards with the driving element. When the first ratchet of the driving element contacts the second ratchet of the collar, the driving element is stopped in the collar. The screw is still moved downwards, and the driving element is turned into rotation from translation. Due to engagement of the first ratchet with the second ratchet, the driving element rotates the collar and therefore the lower tube. The lower tube rotates the mop head and the net to spin-drying. In another aspect, the spin-dryable mop further includes a cover attached to an upper face of the collar. The height of the cavity is larger than the height of the driving element plus the height of the second ratchet. When the upper tube is moved upwards again after it is moved downwards, the screw moves the driving element upwards in the collar so that the first ratchet is disengaged from the second ratchet. The driving element continues to move upwards so that an upper end of the driving element contacts a lower end of the collar and that the driving element is stopped. Now, the screw is still moved upwards, and the driving element is turned into rotation from translation. The driving element is rotated in the collar without driving the lower tube because the first ratchet is disengaged from the second ratchet. In another aspect, the spin-dryable mop further includes a washer located on the screw. The washer is located between the cap and the collar. Thus, the screw does not hit the collar when the upper tube is moved downwards. In another aspect, the spin-dryable mop further includes a spring located between the cap and the washer. Thus, the spring is used to improve buffer. In another aspect, the spin-dryable mop further includes a fastener secured to a lower end of the screw and a second washer located on the screw, wherein the second washer is located between the collar and the fastener. Thus, the collar cannot be dropped from a lower end of the screw when the screw is moved upwards. In another aspect, the sleeve includes a first rib formed on an internal face. The collar includes a second rib corresponding to the first rib, wherein the second rib is made with an external diameter larger than an internal diameter of the first rib. In another aspect, the collar includes two lugs so that the opening is located between the lugs. The lug includes a first aperture, wherein the quick-release includes a second aperture corresponding to the first aperture. A pin is inserted in the first aperture and the second aperture to pivotally connect the quick-release to the sleeve. In another aspect, the cam is formed at an end of the quick-release. The quick-release includes a lever formed at another end. The lever is used to facilitate pivoting of the quick-release. In another aspect, the sleeve includes a cavity. The shelter includes an engaging element inserted in the cavity when the spin-dryable mop is in use. Thus, the shelter of the spin-drying mechanism is engaged with the sleeve when the spin-dryable mop is in use. In another aspect, the sleeve further includes a groove in communication with the cavity. The engaging element includes an elastic block inserted in the groove when the spin-dryable mop is in use. Thus, the spin-drying mechanism is engaged with the sleeve when the spin-dryable mop is in use. In another aspect, the spin-dryable mop further includes a bearing and a clip. The shelter includes a cavity for receiving the bearing. The bearing includes an external ring inserted in the cavity and an internal ring extending out of the cavity. The clip is located on the net corresponding to the internal ring of the bearing. The clip is engaged with the internal ring of the bearing. Thus, the shelter and the net are rotatable with each other. In another aspect, the shelter and the net are in the form of a trumpet including a smaller upper end and a larger lower end. The shelter and the net are hollow from the upper end to the lower end. In another aspect, each of the shelter and the net includes a grip and a hollow portion. The grip is connected to an upper end of the hollow portion. The hollow portion is used to receive the cleaning unit when spin-drying is conducted. The grip is used to facilitate holding of the spin-dryable mop. In another aspect, the net includes a plurality of apertures so that water can easily be cast from the mop head. In another aspect, the mop head includes a second joint and a cleaning unit. The second joint is detachably connected to a lower end of the lower tube. The cleaning unit is connected to the second joint. In another aspect, the cleaning unit includes cloth. In another aspect, the mop head includes a connecting unit and a cleaning unit. The connecting unit includes a second joint, a plate and several foldable elements. The second joint is detachably connected to a lower end of the lower tube.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS Referring to FIGS. 1 through 4, a spin-dryable mop includes a handle 10, a spinning mechanism 20, a locking mechanism 30, a spin-drying mechanism 40 and a mop head 50 according to a first embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIGS. 2 and 3, the handle 10 includes an upper tube 110 and a lower tube 120. The upper tube 110 receives the lower tube 120. The upper tube 110 is connected to the lower tube 120 via the spinning mechanism 20. The spinning mechanism 20 is axially movable relative to the upper tube 110 and the lower tube 120 to rotate the upper tube 110 relative to the lower tube 120. The lower tube 120 includes a first join 121 at a lower end. Referring to FIGS. 5 and 6, the locking mechanism 30 includes a sleeve 310 and quick-release 320. The sleeve 310 is located around and secured to the upper tube 110. The sleeve 310 is located in a place where the upper tube 110 is connected to the lower tube 120. The sleeve 310 includes a cavity 311 in the bottom and an opening 312 in the periphery. The quick-release 320 is pivotally connected to the periphery of the sleeve 310, in the opening 312. The quick-release 320 includes a cam 321 formed at a first end and a lever 322 formed at a second end. The lever 322 is used to facilitate pivoting of the cam 321. Referring to FIG. 7, in operation, the cam 321 is located against the lower tube 120 through the opening 312 of the sleeve 310 to avoid movement of the upper tube 110 relative to lower tube 120. That is, the upper tube 110 is kept in position relative to the lower tube 120. The quick-release 320 can be pivoted from the sleeve 311 to disengage the cam 321 of the quick-release 320 from the lower tube 120 to allow the upper tube 110 to move relative to the lower tube 120. Referring to FIGS. 8 and 9, the spin-drying mechanism 40 includes a shelter 410 and a net 420. The shelter 410 and the net 420 look like a trumpet formed with a smaller upper end and a larger lower end. The shelter 410 and the net 420 are hollow. The shelter 410 includes a grip 410a and a hollow portion 410b. The grip 410a is connected to an upper end of the hollow portion 410b. The net 420 includes a grip 420a and a hollow portion 420b. The grip 420a is connected to an upper end of the hollow portion 420b. The net 420 includes a plurality of apertures 421. The net 420 is movably supported on the lower tube 120. The shelter 410 is located around the net 420. The shelter 410 is rotatable relative to the net 420. The shelter 410 includes an engaging element 411 formed at the top. The engaging element 411 includes an elastic block 412 formed on a side. Referring to FIG. 10, in operation, the engaging element 411 is located in the cavity 311 of the sleeve 310, thus keeping the shelter 410 of the spin-drying mechanism 40 in the sleeve 310. The mop head 50 is connected to a lower end of the lower tube 120. Referring to FIGS. 11 and 12, in the handle 10, the spinning mechanism 20 includes a cap 210, a screw 220, a driving element 230 and a collar 240. The cap 210 is inserted in and secured to the upper tube 110. The screw 220 is secured to a lower end of the cap 210. The driving element 230 is movably supported on the screw 220. Referring to FIG. 13, the driving element 230 includes a ratchet 231 at the bottom. The collar 240 is inserted in and secured to the lower tube 120. The collar 240 includes an internal space for receiving the driving element 230. The screw 220 extends through the collar 240. The collar 240 includes a second ratchet 241 formed at the bottom corresponding to the first ratchet 231 of the driving element 230. Thus, when the upper tube 110 is pressed, the screw 220 moves the driving element 230 downwards. When the first ratchet 231 of the driving element 230 encounters the second ratchet 241 of the collar 240, the first ratchet 231 of the driving element 230 is stopped by and kept in the collar 240. At this moment, the screw 220 is still moved downwards because of a downward force from the upper tube 110. The driving element 230 is turned into rotation from translation. Due to the engagement of the first ratchet 231 with the second ratchet 241, the driving element 230 causes the collar 240 to rotate together. The lower tube 120 is rotated simultaneously. The lower tube 120 rotates the mop head 50 and the net 420. Thus, the mop head 50 is spin-dried. Referring to FIG. 13, a cover 250 is secured to the top of the collar 240. As the driving element 230 is moved downwards in the collar 240, the height of the internal space of the collar 240 is larger than the height of the driving element 230 plus the height of the second ratchet 241. When the upper tube 110 is lifted after it is pressed, the screw 220 moves the driving element 230 upwards in the collar 240 to disengage the first ratchet 231 from the second ratchet 241. As the driving element 230 is further moved upwards, its top reaches the bottom of the cover 250 and the upward movement is stopped. At this moment, the screw 220 is still moved upwards by the upper tube 110 so that the driving element 230 is turned into rotation from translation. At this moment, since the first ratchet 231 is disengaged from the second ratchet 241, the driving element 230 is still rotated in the collar 240 without rotating the lower tube 120. Referring to FIGS. 11 and 12, a washer 221 is located on the screw 220. The washer 221 is located between the cap 210 and the cover 250 to prevent cap 210 from hitting the cover 250 and getting damaged when the upper tube 110 is pressed.
