(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5 -difluorophenyl) acrylate
(E)-methyl 3-(3,5-difluoro-4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-6-(((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)oxy)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)phenyl)a crylate 70g (250 mg, 0.43 mmol), tert-butyl carbamate (76 mg, 0.65 mmol), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (79 mg, 0.086 mmol), 4,5-bis(diphenylphosphino)-9,9-dimethylxanthene (100 mg, 0.172 mmol), cesium carbonate (280 mg, 0.86 mmol) and 3 mL of 1,4-dioxane were placed in a microwave tube. The mixture was warmed up to 125Â°C and stirred in microwave for 55 minutes, then the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by CombiFlash flash preparation instrument with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-((tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino)-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3,5-dimeth yl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 70h (117 mg, yield 50%) as a yellow oil.
