No. 13/145,323, filed Aug. 4, 2011, which is a National Stage Application of PCT/EP2010/050684 filed Jan. 21, 2010, which claims priority from European Patent Application 09151027.1 filed Jan. 21, 2009, which all are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties. The present invention relates to antibacterial compounds of a formula: wherein X1, X2, X3; X4, X5, X6, and X7, each independently of the others, represent nitrogen or CR2 wherein at least one of all groups X1, X2, X3; X4, X5, X6, and X7 but not more than two of either X4, X5 and X6 or X1, X2, X3 and X7 represent nitrogen and wherein R1 and R2 are selected from hydrogen and certain substituents which substituents also include more complex molecular side chains.

The necessary starting materials for the synthetic methods as described herein, if not commercially available, may be made by procedures which are described in the scientific literature, or could be made from commercially available compounds using adaptations of processes reported in the scientific literature. The reader is further referred to Advanced Organic Chemistry, 5th Edition, by J. March and M. Smith, published by John Wiley & Sons, 2001, for general guidance on reaction conditions and reagents. Furthermore in some of the reactions mentioned herein it may be necessary or desirable to protect any sensitive groups in compounds. Conventional protecting groups may be used in accordance with standard practice (for illustration see Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, by T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, published by John Wiley & Sons, 1999). The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient stage in the synthesis using conventional techniques well known in the art, or they may be removed during a later reaction step or work-up. In Scheme 1, PG1 is a protecting group (such as allyloxycarbonyl (Alloc), benzyloxycarbonyl, 9-fluorenylmethylcarbonyl (Fmoc), tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) or benzyl), L1 and L2 are halogen, in particular Br, C1, or OH, and the other symbols have the same meanings as previously described. Compounds of formula V-1 are usually obtained by reacting the corresponding free amine with allyl, fluorenylmethyl or benzyl chloroformate or with di tert-butyl dicarbonate in presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, sodium hydrogencarbonate, triethylamine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine or imidazole. They can also be protected as N-benzyl derivatives by reaction with benzyl bromide or chloride in presence of a base such as sodium carbonate or triethylamine. Alternatively, N-benzyl derivatives can be obtained through reductive amination in presence of benzaldehyde. Further strategies to introduce other amine protecting groups have been described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, by T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, published by John Wiley & Sons, 1999. Compounds of formula VIII-1 (Scheme 1) can be obtained from compounds of formula V-1 wherein L2 is OH via a Mitsunobu coupling (as reviewed in O. Mitsunobu, Synthesis 1981, 1) with compounds of formula IV-1 for which L1 is a hydroxy group. The reaction is for example performed in the presence of diethyl or diisopropyl azodicarboxylate and triphenylphosphine, in a wide range of solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane or dichloromethane and within a wide range of temperatures (between −20° C. and 60° C.). The reaction might also be performed using polymer-supported triphenylphosphine. An alternative route to form compounds of formula VIII-1 consists of reacting compounds of formula V-1 wherein L2 is —OH with compounds of formula IV-1 for which L1 is a hydroxy group, which needs to be activated prior to the reaction as described below or a halogen atom in presence of an inorganic base such as sodium hydride or the like in a solvent such as dichloromethane or N,N-dimethylformamide at a temperature ranging between −20° C. and 80° C. Activation of the hydroxy group of compounds of formula V-1 wherein L1 is —OH as for example a mesylate, a tosylate or a triflate can be achieved by reacting the compound of formula V-1 wherein L1 is —OH with methanesulfonyl chloride or methanesulfonic anhydride, p-toluenesulfonyl chloride, trifluoromethanesulfonyl chloride or trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride, respectively, in presence of a base such as triethylamine or the like in a dry aprotic solvent such as pyridine, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran or dichloromethane between −30° C. and 60° C. Finally, compounds of formula VIII-1 can be generated by reacting compound of formula IV-1 wherein L1 is a hydroxy group with a compound of formula V-1 wherein L2 is a halogen atom or a hydroxyl group which needs to be activated prior to the reaction as for example a mesylate, tosylate or triflate as described above. The coupling is performed in presence of an inorganic base such as sodium hydride in a solvent such as dichloromethane or N,N-dimethylformamide at a temperature ranging between −20° C. and 80° C. Removal of the protecting group PG1 in compounds of formula VIII-1 is carried out under standard conditions to generate compounds of formula II-1. For example the benzyl carbamates are deprotected by hydrogenolysis over a noble catalyst (e.g. palladium on activated carbon). The Boc group is removed under acidic conditions such as hydrochloric acid in an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, or trifluoroacetic acid neat or diluted in a solvent such as dichloromethane. The Alloc group is removed in presence of a palladium salt such as palladium acetate or tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) and an allyl cation scavenger such as morpholine, pyrrolidine, dimedone or tributylstannane between 0° C. and 70° C. in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran. The N-benzyl protected amines are deprotected by hydrogenolysis over a noble catalyst (e.g. palladium dihydroxide). The Fmoc protecting group is removed under mild basic conditions such as diluted morpholine or piperidine in N,N-dimethylformamide. Further general methods to remove amine protecting groups have been described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, by T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, published by John Wiley & Sons, 1999. Compounds of formula I-1 wherein A3 is CH2 can be obtained from intermediate II-1 (Scheme 1) by reaction with a compound of formula III wherein L0 is —CHO either in the presence of or followed by a reaction with a suitable reducing agent. The reaction between the amine and the aldehyde to form an intermediate imine is conducted in a solvent system allowing the removal of the formed water through physical or chemical means (e.g. distillation of the solvent-water azeotrope or presence of drying agents such as molecular sieves, magnesium sulfate or sodium sulfate). Such solvents are typically toluene, n-hexane, tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, acetonitrile, 1,2-dichloroethane or mixture of solvents such as methanol:1,2-dichloroethane. The reaction can be catalyzed by traces of acid (usually acetic acid). The imine is reduced subsequently or simultaneously with a suitable reagent such as sodium borohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride (R. O. and M. K. Hutchins, Comprehensive Organic Synthesis, B. M. Trost, I. Fleming, Eds; Pergamon Press: New York (1991), vol. 8, p. 25-78). The reaction is preferably carried out between 0° C. and 60° C. Compounds of formula I-1 wherein A3 is >C(═O) can be obtained from intermediate II-1 (Scheme 1) through reaction with a carboxylic acid derivative III (L0=COOH), in the presence of an activating agent such as N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, with the optional addition of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole. Other suitable coupling agents may be utilized such as, 0-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, 2-ethoxy-1-ethoxycarbonyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline, carbonyldiimidazole or diethylphosphorylcyanide. Optionally, a base like triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine or pyridine can be added to perform the coupling. The peptidic coupling is conducted at a temperature comprised between −20° C. and 80° C., in an inert solvent, preferably a dry aprotic solvent like dichloromethane, acetonitrile or N,N-dimethylformamide and chloroform. Alternatively, the carboxylic acid can be activated by conversion into its corresponding acid chloride or its corresponding activated ester, such as the N-hydroxysuccinimidyl ester (Org. Process Res. & Dev., 2002, 863) or the benzothiazolyl thioester (J. Antibiotics, 2000, 1071). The generated activated entity can react at a temperature comprised between −20° C. and 80° C. with compound of formula II-1 in an aprotic solvent like dichloromethane, chloroform, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran to generate compound of formula I-1. Optionally, a base like triethylamine, N,N-diisopropylethylamine, pyridine, sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate can be added to perform the coupling. Alternatively, compounds of formula I-1 wherein A3 is —CH2— can be obtained from intermediate II-1 by reaction with a compound of formula III wherein L0 is —CH2Y and Y is a leaving group like methylsulfonyl, tolylsulfonyl, trifluoromethylsulfonyl or halogen at a temperature between −20° C. and 100° C. in a dry aprotic solvent like dichloromethane, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide or tetrahydrofuran without or with a base such as potassium carbonate or N,N-diisopropylethylamine. In Scheme 1, coupling of compounds of general formulae IV-1 and V-1, followed by a deprotection step and finally introduction of the A3-G substituent allowed the generation of compounds of formula I-1. Alternatively, the protecting group PG1 of compounds of formula V-1 can be removed according to the methods described above and the product of this reaction can then be reacted with one of the compounds of formula III as defined above. Subsequently, these intermediates are converted into compounds of formula I-1 following the methods described above for the synthesis of compounds of formula VIII-1. In Scheme 2, L1 is a carboxylic acid C(O)—OH or its corresponding acid halide or other activated acyl derivatives, anhydride or mixed anhydride. All the other symbols have the same meanings as in formula I or in Scheme 1. The reaction between compounds of formulae IV-2 wherein L1 is COOH and V-2 to generate compounds of formula I-2 is performed with the addition of a coupling agent such as N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or the like, and optionally with the addition of 4-dimethylaminopyridine, imidazole or the like. The reaction between compounds of formula IV-2 wherein L1 is an acid halide, or any other activated acyl derivative and V-2 to generate compounds of formula I-2 is performed in the presence of a base such as triethylamine or sodium hydride and optionally 4-dimethylaminopyridine. The acylation is conducted at a temperature comprised between −20° C. and 60° C., in an inert solvent, preferably a dry aprotic solvent like dichloromethane, acetonitrile, N,N-dimethylformamide or chloroform. Alternatively, compounds of formula I-2 can be generated by first coupling compounds of formulae IV-2 and V-3 according to the methods described above to generate the intermediate VIII-2 and subsequent removal of the protecting group PG1 and introduction of the substituent A3-G following procedures previously described for Scheme 1. In Scheme 3, L1 and L2 are SH, Br, Cl or the group OSO2R in which R is CH3, CF3, or tolyl and all the other symbols have the same meanings as in formula I or in Scheme 1. In the case where A2 in compound VIII-3 is a saturated or unsaturated 4 to 8-membered heterocyclodiyl group, which is linked to the —CH2—(CH2)m—S— group via a ring nitrogen atom, the compounds of formula VIII-3 can be obtained via reductive amination between VI-1 and VII-1 following procedures previously described in conjunction with Scheme 1 for the preparation of compounds of formula I-1 wherein A3 is CH2 by reaction of an intermediate II-1 with a compound of formula III wherein L0 is —CHO. Alternatively, compounds of formula VIII-3 can be obtained by reacting compounds of formula IV-3 for which L1 is SH with compounds of formula V-4 for which L2 is Br, Cl or the group OSO2R in which R is CH3, CF3, or tolyl in presence of a base such as sodium hydroxide, sodium hydride, sodium carbonate, potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, triethylamine in a solvent such as acetone, acetonitrile, ethanol, isopropanol or N,N-dimethylformamide at a temperature ranging between 0° C. and 120° C. In this procedure, the mesylate, tosylate or triflate derivatives are generated from the corresponding alcohol following procedures previously described for Scheme 1. Alternatively, compounds of formula VIII-3 can be obtained by reacting compounds of formula IV-3 for which L1 is Br, Cl or the group OSO2R in which R is CH3, CF3, or tolyl with compounds of formula V-4 where L2 is SH. In that case, the reaction can be performed in presence of a palladium salt such as palladium acetate or tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) with the optional addition of a base such as sodium tert-butylate in a solvent such as toluene, N,N-dimethylformamide, dioxane at a temperature ranging from 0° C. and 150° C. The intermediates VIII-3 are further transformed into compounds of formula I-3 using synthetic routes previously described for Scheme 1. Alternatively, the protecting group PG1 of compounds of formula V-4 can be removed and the product of this reaction can then be reacted with a compound of formula III according to the methods described above. Subsequently, these intermediates are reacted with compounds of formula IV-3 to give the compounds of formula I-3 following the methods described above for the synthesis of compounds of formula VIII-1.

When an optically active form of a compound of the invention is required, it may be obtained by carrying out one of the above procedures using a pure enantiomer or diastereomer as a starting material, or by resolution of a mixture of the enantiomers or diastereomers of the final product or intermediate using a standard procedure. The resolution of enantiomers may be achieved by chromatography on a chiral stationary phase, such as REGIS PIRKLE COVALENT (R-R) WHELK-02, 10 μm, 100 Å, 250×21.1 mm column.
