Synthesis Example 4
Synthesis of Compound 136
2.33 g (2.12 mmol, yield=60%) of Compound 136 was synthesized in the same manner as in Synthesis Example 1, except that 3.17 g (7.08 mmol) of 10-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)anthracene-9-carbaldehyde was used instead of 1.64 g (7.08 mmol) of 4-phenyl-1-naphthaldehyde, and Intermediate 4-hydroxy-3-(10-(9-phenyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)anthracen-9-yl)pent-3-en-2-one was used instead of Intermediate 4-hydroxy-3-(4-phenylnaphthalen-1-yl)pent-3-en-2-one.
