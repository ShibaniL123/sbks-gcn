RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/977,296, filed on Apr. 9, 2014, the entire disclosure of each of these applications being incorporated herein by this reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to carbamoyl hydrazine derivatives, processes for preparing them, pharmaceutical compositions containing them, and their use as pharmaceuticals as modulators of the N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR), including the N-formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2). The invention relates specifically to the use of these compounds and their pharmaceutical compositions to treat disorders associated with FPR modulation, such as FPR2 modulation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The FPR2 receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor that is expressed on inflammatory cells such as monocytes and neutrophils, as well as T cells, and has been shown to play a critical role in leukocyte trafficking during inflammation and human pathology. FPR2 is an exceptionally promiscuous receptor that responds to a large array of exogenous and endogenous ligands, including serum amyloid A (SAA), chemokine variant sCKβ8-1, the neuroprotective peptide human, anti-inflammatory eicosanoid lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and glucocorticoid-modulated protein annexin A1. FPR2 transduces anti-inflammatory effects of LXA4 in many systems, but it also can mediate the pro-inflammatory signaling cascade of peptides such as SAA. The ability of the receptor to mediate two opposite effects is proposed to be a result of different receptor domains used by different agonists (Parmentier, Marc et al., Cytokine & Growth Factor Reviews 17 (2006) 501-519). Activation of FPR2 by LXA4 or its analogs and by Annexin I protein has been shown to result in anti-inflammatory activity by promoting active resolution of inflammation which involves inhibition of polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) and eosinophil migration and also stimulating monocyte migration, enabling clearance of apoptotic cells from the site of inflammation in a nonphlogistic manner. In addition, FPR2 has been shown to inhibit natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity and promote activation of T cells, which further contributes to down-regulation of tissue damaging inflammatory signals. FPR2/LXA4 interaction has been shown to be beneficial in experimental models of ischemia reperfusion, angiogenesis, dermal inflammation, chemotherapy-induced alopecia, ocular inflammation such as endotoxin-induced uveitis, corneal wound healing, re-epithelialization etc. FPR2 thus represents an important novel pro-resolutionary molecular target for the development of new therapeutic agents in diseases with excessive inflammatory responses. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION We have now discovered a group of novel compounds which are potent and selective FPR2 modulators. As such, the compounds described herein are useful in treating a wide variety of disorders associated with modulation of the FPR receptor, such as FPR2. The term “modulator” as used herein, includes but is not limited to: receptor agonist, antagonist, inverse agonist, inverse antagonist, partial agonist, partial antagonist. This invention describes compounds of Formula I, which have FPR2 receptor biological activity. The compounds in accordance with the present invention are thus of use in medicine, for example in the treatment of humans with diseases and conditions that are alleviated by FPR modulation, such as FPR2 modulation.

In another embodiment of the invention, there are provided pharmaceutical compositions including at least one compound of the invention in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier thereof. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” means the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be used in the form of a solid, a solution, an emulsion, a dispersion, a patch, a micelle, a liposome, and the like, wherein the resulting composition contains one or more compounds of the present invention, as an active ingredient, in admixture with an organic or inorganic carrier or excipient suitable for enteral or parenteral applications. Invention compounds may be combined, for example, with the usual non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for tablets, pellets, capsules, suppositories, solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and any other form suitable for use. The carriers which can be used include glucose, lactose, gum acacia, gelatin, mannitol, starch paste, magnesium trisilicate, talc, corn starch, keratin, colloidal silica, potato starch, urea, medium chain length triglycerides, dextrans, and other carriers suitable for use in manufacturing preparations, in solid, semisolid, or liquid form. In addition auxiliary, stabilizing, thickening and coloring agents and perfumes may be used. Invention compounds are included in the pharmaceutical composition in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect upon the process or disease condition. Pharmaceutical compositions containing invention compounds may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known in the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose, or saccharin, flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of wintergreen or cherry, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets containing invention compounds in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may also be manufactured by known methods. The excipients used may be, for example, (1) inert diluents such as calcium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; (2) granulating and disintegrating agents such as corn starch, potato starch or alginic acid; (3) binding agents such as gum tragacanth, corn starch, gelatin or acacia, and (4) lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. In some cases, formulations for oral use may be in the form of hard gelatin capsules wherein the invention compounds are mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin. They may also be in the form of soft gelatin capsules wherein the invention compounds are mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to known methods using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides, fatty acids (including oleic acid), naturally occurring vegetable oils like sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, etc., or synthetic fatty vehicles like ethyl oleate or the like. Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants, and the like can be incorporated as required. Pharmaceutical compositions containing invention compounds may be in a form suitable for topical use, for example, as oily suspensions, as solutions or suspensions in aqueous liquids or nonaqueous liquids, or as oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsions. Pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared by combining a therapeutically effective amount of at least one compound according to the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, as an active ingredient with conventional ophthalmically acceptable pharmaceutical excipients and by preparation of unit dosage suitable for topical ocular use. The therapeutically efficient amount typically is between about 0.001 and about 5% (w/v), preferably about 0.001 to about 2.0% (w/v) in liquid formulations. For ophthalmic application, preferably solutions are prepared using a physiological saline solution as a major vehicle. The pH of such ophthalmic solutions should preferably be maintained between 4.5 and 8.0 with an appropriate buffer system, a neutral pH being preferred but not essential. The formulations may also contain conventional pharmaceutically acceptable preservatives, stabilizers and surfactants. Preferred preservatives that may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to, benzalkonium chloride, chlorobutanol, thimerosal, phenylmercuric acetate and phenylmercuric nitrate. A preferred surfactant is, for example, Tween 80. Likewise, various preferred vehicles may be used in the ophthalmic preparations of the present invention. These vehicles include, but are not limited to, polyvinyl alcohol, povidone, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, poloxamers, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose cyclodextrin and purified water. Tonicity adjustors may be added as needed or convenient. They include, but are not limited to, salts, particularly sodium chloride, potassium chloride, mannitol and glycerin, or any other suitable ophthalmically acceptable tonicity adjustor. Various buffers and means for adjusting pH may be used so long as the resulting preparation is ophthalmically acceptable. Accordingly, buffers include acetate buffers, citrate buffers, phosphate buffers and borate buffers. Acids or bases may be used to adjust the pH of these formulations as needed. In a similar manner an ophthalmically acceptable antioxidant for use in the present invention includes, but is not limited to, sodium metabisulfite, sodium thiosulfate, acetylcysteine, butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene. Other excipient components which may be included in the ophthalmic preparations are chelating agents. The preferred chelating agent is edentate disodium, although other chelating agents may also be used in place of or in conjunction with it. The ingredients are usually used in the following amounts: Ingredient Amount (% w/v) active ingredient about 0.001-5 preservative 0-0.10 vehicle 0-40 tonicity adjustor 0-10 buffer 0.01-10 pH adjustor q.s. pH 4.5-7.8 antioxidant as needed surfactant as needed purified water to make 100% The actual dose of the active compounds of the present invention depends on the specific compound, and on the condition to be treated; the selection of the appropriate dose is well within the knowledge of the skilled artisan. The ophthalmic formulations of the present invention are conveniently packaged in forms suitable for metered application, such as in containers equipped with a dropper, to facilitate application to the eye. Containers suitable for drop wise application are usually made of suitable inert, non-toxic plastic material, and generally contain between about 0.5 and about 15 ml solution. One package may contain one or more unit doses. Especially preservative-free solutions are often formulated in non-resalable containers containing up to about ten, preferably up to about five units doses, where a typical unit dose is from one to about 8 drops, preferably one to about 3 drops. The volume of one drop usually is about 20-35 μl. The compounds of the invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions may be prepared by mixing the invention compounds with a suitable non-irritating excipient, such as cocoa butter, synthetic glyceride esters of polyethylene glycols, which are solid at ordinary temperatures, but liquefy and/or dissolve in the rectal cavity to release the drug. Since individual subjects may present a wide variation in severity of symptoms and each drug has its unique therapeutic characteristics, the precise mode of administration and dosage employed for each subject is left to the discretion of the practitioner. The compounds and pharmaceutical compositions described herein are useful as medicaments in mammals, including humans, for treatment of diseases and/or alleviations of conditions which are responsive to treatment by agonists or functional antagonists of the FPR receptor, such as FPR2. Thus, in further embodiments of the invention, there are provided methods for treating a disorder associated with modulation of the FPR receptor, such as modulation of the FPR2 receptor. Such methods can be performed, for example, by administering to a subject in need thereof a pharmaceutical composition containing a therapeutically effective amount of at least one invention compound. As used herein, the term “therapeutically effective amount” means the amount of the pharmaceutical composition that will elicit the biological or medical response of a subject in need thereof that is being sought by the researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician. In some embodiments, the subject in need thereof is a mammal. In some embodiments, the mammal is human. The present invention concerns also processes for preparing the compounds of Formula I. The compounds of Formula I according to the invention can be prepared analogously to conventional methods as understood by the person skilled in the art of synthetic organic chemistry. Synthetic Scheme 1, set forth below, illustrates how the compounds according to the invention can be made. Compounds within the scope of the invention may be prepared as depicted in Scheme 1. In general, a N-arylhydrazinecarboxamide can be alkylated with an aldehyde under reductive amination conditions (e.g., NaCNBH3) to produce a N′-substituted N-arylhydrazinecarboxamide. This compound (or an unsubstituted N-arylhydrazinecarboxamide) can be treated with an appropriately substituted acid chloride in the presence of a base or a substituted carboxylic acid in the presence of a coupling agent like EDC to provide compounds of Formula I. At this stage, those skilled in the art will appreciate that many additional compounds that fall under the scope of the invention covered by Formula I may be prepared by performing various common chemical reactions. Details of certain specific chemical transformations are provided in the Examples that follow. Those skilled in the art will be able to routinely modify and/or adapt the schemes to synthesize any compounds of the invention covered by Formula I. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention claimed. As used herein, the use of the singular includes the plural unless specifically stated otherwise. It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art that some of the compounds of the invention may contain one or more asymmetric centers, such that the compounds may exist in enantiomeric as well as in diastereomeric forms. Unless it is specifically noted otherwise, the scope of the present invention includes all enantiomers, diastereomers and mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures. Some of the compounds of the invention may form salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids or bases, and such pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds described herein are also within the scope of the invention. The present invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically enriched compounds. Any compound of the invention may contain one or more isotopic atoms enriched or different than the natural ratio such as deuterium 2H (or D) in place of hydrogen 1H (or H) or use of 13C enriched material in place of 12C and the like. Similar substitutions can be employed for N, O and S. The use of isotopes may assist in analytical as well as therapeutic aspects of the invention. For example, use of deuterium may increase the in vivo half-life by altering the metabolism (rate) of the compounds of the invention. These compounds can be prepared in accord with the preparations described by use of isotopically enriched reagents. The following Examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended, nor should they be construed as limiting the invention in any manner. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that variations and modifications of the following Examples can be made without exceeding the spirit or scope of the invention. As will be evident to those skilled in the art, individual diastereoisomeric forms can be obtained by separation of mixtures thereof in a conventional manner. For example, chromatographic separation may be employed; chiral chromatography may be performed to separate individual enantiomers. Compound names were generated with ACDLab version 12.5; some intermediates' and reagents' names used in the examples were generated with softwares such as Chem Bio Draw Ultra version 12.0, ACDLab version 12.5 or Auto Nom 2000 from MDL ISIS Draw 2.5 SP1. In general, characterization of the compounds was performed using NMR spectra, which were recorded on a 300 or 600 MHz Varian NMR spectrometer and acquired at room temperature. Chemical shifts are given in ppm referenced either to internal TMS or to the solvent signal.
