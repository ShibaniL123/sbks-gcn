FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to photoacoustic (PA) probes and, more particularly, to PA probes for directing output from a wavelength conversion assembly. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A sentinel lymph node biopsy is a means by which to stage cancer and to judge the risk that it will metastasize via the lymphatic system. The sentinel lymph node is the first node to receive lymphatic drainage from the tumor. If cancer has spread to the sentinel lymph node, it may have spread further. A radioactive tracer and/or a non-ionizing blue dye is applied to facilitate the biopsy. The blue-colored draining path away from the tumor is visually distinguished by means of surgery and the physician's direct gaze onto the body tissue. Photoacoustic imaging is a noninvasive, non-ionizing imaging modality that combines ultrasonic resolution with optical contrast. Photoacoustic imaging relies on the photoacoustic effect to generate pressure waves that can be detected by ultrasound array transducers. Typically, a short laser pulse illuminates tissue leading to optical absorption, followed by rapid heating and thermoelastic expansion to produce pressure waves. Since photoacoustic images can be reconstructed following ultrasound detection with conventional array transducers, it is highly compatible with ultrasound imaging. The same detection mechanism greatly simplifies spatial registration between photoacoustic and ultrasound images. While photoacoustic imaging is able to image a body based on native tissue contrast, such as from hemoglobin in blood, utilization of contrast agents is able to address a broader spectrum of applications for medical photoacoustic imaging. Methylene blue dye, for example, is routinely used in clinical practice for sentinel lymph node biopsy and is detectable by photoacoustic imaging of the appropriate optical wavelength. Efficient generation of photoacoustic waves depends on rapid energy deposition that meets the conditions for thermal and stress confinement. In practice, high-energy output, Q-switched pulsed lasers with pulse durations of around 10 ns are used to illuminate tissue for photoacoustic imaging. For the delivery of high energy laser pulses, a set of mirrors located inside an articulated arm is possible. An articulated arm that incorporates a dye-impregnated polymer rod for optical wavelength conversion is commercially available for cosmetic laser applications (i.e. tattoo removal, etc.) (http://www.conbio.com/cynosure/aesthetic-lasers-sub/revlite) (hereinafter “the Cynosure laser”), but the laser is not designed for imaging. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Aspects of the present invention are directed to addressing one or more of the shortcomings noted above with regard to the prior art. Contrast agents used in medical photoacoustic imaging are typically sensitive to the optical wavelength. That property is useful in distinguishing the contrast agent signal from the background tissue signals, but it also requires the laser source used for imaging to match the optical absorption spectral characteristics of the contrast agent. Typically, one needs to convert light from a standard laser output wavelength (such as defined by the laser gain medium to be 1064 nanometers (nm) for Nd:YAG, or around 694 nm for ruby, etc.) to the desired wavelength. OPO (optical parametric oscillator) systems and dye lasers are two solutions for doing exactly that. The ability to perform photoacoustic imaging on a conventional ultrasound scanner requires a compact and rugged laser source that is compatible with the clinical environment. Research lasers currently used for photoacoustic imaging are too bulky, too heavy, and not robust enough to be incorporated into a commercial grade ultrasound scanner or an imaging workstation within a practical footprint. Ultrasound imaging is a real-time imaging modality, and modern scanners can be moved from bedside to procedure rooms and shared between hospital departments. The development of an ultrasound system with photoacoustics calls for a suitable laser that can accommodate a reasonable degree of portability without the realignment of optical components. Currently available lasers offer a limited selection of optical wavelengths, which limits the range of optical absorbers (i.e., imaging contrast agents) that can be imaged photoacoustically. Commonly used lasers include Nd:YAG (1064 nm), ruby (694.3 nm), and alexandrite (755 nm) lasers. Harmonic generators can be used to achieve shorter wavelengths, (e.g., harmonic generators with an Nd:YAG laser can reach 532 nm, 355 nm, 266 nm, and 213 nm), at the expense of pulse energy and pulse-to-pulse stability. Functional photoacoustic imaging, or the ability to distinguish optical absorbers based on spectral differences in absorption, requires multiple laser wavelengths. Generally, tunable lasers are bulky, complex, unreliable (require a sophisticated user maintenance) and expensive, which make them difficult to integrate with conventional ultrasound scanners. Switching between optical wavelengths would be especially useful for spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging or to differentiate photoacoustic absorbers. However, the high-power tunable lasers available usually need seconds to switch between two wavelengths. According to what is proposed herein below, switching can be done in real time, at 100 Hz for example, thus aiding the ongoing biopsy procedure with real time imaging. Optical parametric oscillators (OPO) lasers can be pumped for wavelength tuning but they have limited output power. Also, the beam shape and especially the pulse stability are poor. Dye lasers can also be pumped for wavelength tuning, but the size of commercially available systems is not suitable for compact light delivery for photoacoustic imaging. The Cynosure cosmetic laser mentioned above is a dye laser, but its pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of about 2 hertz (Hz) is too low for imaging. Typically, for imaging, a PRF of greater than 20 Hz is desired. Also, the dye-impregnated polymer of the Cynosure cosmetic laser has a relatively low lifetime of only about 10,000 laser shots. Additionally, powerful medical lasers utilize an articulated arm as a means for light delivery to the point of interest. The articulated arm works well for therapeutic use point by point, but is inadequate for imaging purposes which generally call for high flexibility. In short, currently available commercial lasers used for photoacoustic imaging suffer from one or more of the following problems. First, the laser size is too big. Second, the wavelength supplied by the laser is not suitable for imaging the desired optical absorber. For instance, the methylene blue absorption peak is 665 nm which is a difficult wavelength to achieve with OPO lasers. Third, the laser is not robust (i.e., reliable) enough or cannot be easily used in a clinical environment. Fourth, combined systems consisting of a pump laser (e.g. Q-switched, Nd:YAG), tunable laser (e.g., OPO or dye laser), and articulated arm for spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging are complex, requiring a complicated alignment, highly skilled user, frequent maintenance, and are too bulky. What is proposed herein is a compact laser and efficient light delivery system that be used for photoacoustic imaging. In an aspect of the present invention, a photoacoustic medical-imaging device includes a wavelength conversion assembly configured for outputting laser pulses at a targeted wavelength. It further includes a photoacoustic probe configured for acoustic coupling to a patient, for directing said pulses, and for acquiring, in response, radiofrequency data for photoacoustic imaging. In a sub-aspect, the device further includes an optical fiber bundle. In a further sub-aspect, the bundle includes an optical fiber having an input end. The device is configured for illuminating, with a homogenous beam, so as to conform to an acceptance angle of the fiber at that end. In a related sub-aspect, the device includes a light collimator, and a diffuser for receiving the outputted laser pulses from the collimator. As a further sub-aspect of this, the diffuser is configured for spreading a focus of the pulsed light over an input aperture of an optical fiber bundle to apportion energy of the pulsed light received by different constituent optical fibers of the bundle according to their respective input diameters. In a yet, further sub-aspect, the device includes a lens configured for receiving pulsed light from the diffuser and for creating the focus to specifically match an acceptance angle. In a different sub-aspect, the device is configured for outputting other laser pulses at another targeted wavelength. It is further configured for performing image subtraction between image frames acquired with the targeted wavelength and the other targeted wavelength, respectively. In a further sub-aspect, the targeted wavelength is no more than 690 nanometers and no less than 640 nanometers. The other targeted wavelength is effective for distinguishing an endogenous photoacoustic contrast source. It is also a sub-aspect that the probe includes at least a portion of an optical fiber bundle. In a further sub-aspect, the device further comprises an optical coupling system operatively coupled between the bundle and the assembly. In a yet further sub-aspect, the bundle has an input end that has a light-interface portion, and the system is configured for focusing a homogenous beam of light so as to specifically span the light-interface portion and so as to conform to an acceptance angle. In one other sub-aspect, at least a portion of the optical fiber bundle is configured based on an optimal size of a beam for photoacoustic imaging. The optimal beam size incident on the patient is a function of both the imaging depth and estimates of respective optical properties of body tissue in the path of the photoacoustic imaging at that depth. In an additional, structural sub-aspect, the probe features an ultrasound transducer having a lateral direction. The portion of the fiber optic bundle is bifurcated into two branches to deliver the pulses from opposite sides of the transducer. Each of the two branches includes sub-bundles running parallel to the lateral direction. As a complementary sub-aspect, the probe is configured for at least one of emitting ultrasound for ultrasonic imaging and receiving ultrasound for ultrasonic imaging In one further sub-aspect, the probe is a handheld probe. In yet another sub-aspect, the assembly resides in the probe. In one yet further sub-aspect, the probe is configured for guiding, from the assembly, the pulsed light externally via free space optics and/or a light guide. As an alternative or complementary sub-aspect, the assembly includes a solid dye-impregnated polymer as a lasing medium. According to a particular sub-aspect, the assembly includes, for the outputting, a rotational beam-path alternator configured for, cyclically at a rate of at least 10 hertz, redirecting: a) to multiple dye cells, a common input beam; and/or b) to a common optical coupling system to a fiber optic bundle, output beams from among respective multiple dye cells. In one still, different sub-aspect, the device is configured mobile and integrally fixed so as to be portable in a clinical setting from room to room without need for realignment of optical components. In some versions and as a sub-aspect, the assembly includes a dye for converting to the targeted wavelength. Likewise, in some versions, the assembly includes a liquid dye as a lasing medium. As a particular, additional sub-aspect, the probe is configured for dynamically adjusting an optical fiber, advancement- and retraction-wise, responsive to a targeted imaging depth. Details of the novel, compact photoacoustic medical-imaging device are set forth further below, with the aid of the following drawings, which are not drawn to scale.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS FIG. 1 shows, by illustrative and non-limitative example, a compact laser, and efficient laser pulse delivery, device 100 for photoacoustic imaging. The device 100 includes an ultrasound scanner 104 having a console, a user display such as a screen for presenting two or three-dimensional images, and user controls for imaging. The device further includes a wavelength conversion assembly 108, a pump laser 112, and an optical coupling system 116. A frequency doubled, Nd:YAG laser serves as the pump laser 112. It can be pulsed with a pulse width of less than 200 nanoseconds (ns). One end of an optical fiber bundle 120 joins the optical coupling system 116 to an integrated ultrasound and photoacoustic (hereinafter “US/PA”) probe 124 at the other end of the fiber bundle. The probe 124 thus contains a portion 126 of the optical fiber bundle 120. The broken lines in FIG. 1 represent that the portion 126 extends on into the probe 124. A communication line 128 connects the scanner 104 to the pump laser 112 and the probe 124. The scanner 104 may include a microprocessor or microcontroller having a computer readable medium, such and one or more integrated circuits. The computer readable medium embodies instructions for managing operation of the device 100, which includes controlling ultrasound beamforming, photoacoustic and ultrasonic data acquisition, photoacoustic image subtraction, image display, etc. Operation of the device 100 may be carried out by any combination of software, hardware and firmware. Photoacoustic images, such as those of a methylene blue dye draining path formed to aid a sentinel lymph node biopsy, are displayable on the user display. Also displayable are ultrasound anatomical imaging, and ultrasound functional imaging such as color flow Doppler imaging. Components of the wavelength conversion assembly 108 include a dye cell 132, a fully reflective resonator-minor 136, and a partially reflective resonator-mirror 140. For simplicity of demonstration, the pump laser 112 is pictured as pumping from above the dye cell 132. However, it is actually pumping from the side, so that the pump beam 144 is horizontally aligned with the resonating beams. The wavelength conversion assembly 108 outputs a laser pulse 148 with each pumping pulse 152. As an alternative, the pump laser 112 is placed collinearly. Thus, the fully reflective resonator-mirror 136 would instead be a dichroic minor, passing the pump beam (e.g., at a wavelength of 532 nm) and fully reflecting emission (e.g., at a wavelength of 645 nm). The dye cell 132 contains a lasing medium 145, such as 4-dicyanomethylene-2-methyl-6-p-dimethylaminostyryl-4H-pyran (DCM) dye mixed with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The wavelength conversion is performed by means of organic dyes that fluoresce at a targeted wavelength. The DCM dye mixed with DMSO solvent converts incident 532 nm light into 651 nm light, a suitable wavelength for imaging methylene blue dye accumulation in sentinel lymph nodes. The dye cell 132 further contains a magnetic stiffing rod (no(shown) to stir the lasing medium 145 to limit dye degradation. The dye cell 132. has a port (not shown) through which the solution can be replaced. Depending on the dye and solvent, they may be replaced after 1 to 24 hours of continuous use. A feedback mechanism dynamically adjusts laser output on consecutive laser shots to maintain laser stability. The mechanism optically detects degradation of the laser dye or gain medium and heating of resonator components, and may compensate for the degradation by boosting the pump over time. The wavelength conversion assembly 108 may alternatively be realized as a solid-state dye laser, comprising as a lasing medium 145 a solid dye-impregnated polymer. The entire assembly 108 is replaceable as a unit. As represented in FIG. 1 by the expanded view of the fiber bundle, the efficient coupling of high-energy laser pulses 148 requires a homogenous laser beam 152 that illuminates an input end 156 of the fiber bundle 120 at all possible incidence angles within the input numerical aperture (or “acceptance angle”) 160 of optical fibers 164 comprising the fiber bundle. Since the light 148 from the dye cell 132 is not well collimated, a series of optical components is needed to deliver light from the dye cell into the fiber bundle 120. The optical coupling system 116 features a diffuser 168 having a microlens array structure as seen from FIG. 2 of U.S. Pat. No. 6,859,326 to Sales. The diffuser 168, also known as an Engineered Diffuser™, can be configured as discussed in the '326 patent, and expanded upon in U.S. Pat. No. 6,835,535 to Gretton et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 7,033,736 to Morris et al. All three patents are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The diffuser 168, in combination with lenses, ensures that a homogenous beam of light is efficiently coupled into the fiber bundle 120. The optical coupling system 116 accordingly further includes a concave lens 172; an input convex lens, or collimator, 176 illuminated by the concave lens; and an output convex lens 180. The two convex lenses 176, 180 sandwich the diffuser 168. The diffuser 168 is configured for spreading a focus of the pulsed light 148 over an input aperture 184 of the optical fiber bundle 120 to apportion energy 188 of the light received by different constituent optical fibers 164 of the bundle 120 according to their respective input diameters 192, i.e., equalize the energy in the usual case of equal diameters. In effect, light of the laser pulse 148 is focused into a small spot which fills the input numerical aperture 160 of the fibers 164, and the diffuser 168 spreads the laser beam focus over the input aperture 184 of the fiber bundle 120 so that each fiber 164 of equal input diameter receives and transmits an equal pulse energy. More particularly, the input end 156 of the fiber bundle 120 has a light-interface portion 196. The light-interface portion 196 is defined herein as a discontinuous end surface that receives light for transmission and thus corresponds to fiber cores and excludes the respective outer claddings 197 that reflectively keep propagating light within the core. The optical coupling system 116 is configured for focusing the homogenous beam 152 so as to specifically span the light-interface portion 196 and so as to conform to an acceptance angle 160 from among those of the constituent optical fibers 164 constituting the fiber bundle 120. The homogenous beam 152 and correct acceptance angle 160 afford efficient light coupling and keep the light incident on the fiber bundle 120 below the fiber damage threshold of constituent fibers 164. The compact laser, and efficient laser pulse delivery, device 100 for photoacoustic imaging further includes wheels 198 for transportation of the device from room to room in a clinical environment. Relatedly, the optical components 112, 132-140, 168-180 of the wavelength conversion assembly 108 and of the optical coupling system 116 are integrally fixed 199 as a rugged unit for such portability without need for realignment of the optical components. The smaller form factor and fewer components of the device 100 enhance portability. FIG. 2 presents a face view 200 and a side view 202 of an exemplary, integrated ultrasound and photoacoustic (US/PA) imaging probe 204. It also presents side views 206, 207 of two other, exemplary PA imaging probes 208, 209. Referring to the face and respective side view 200, 202, the probe 204 has a face 210 that includes two flush, transparent windows 212. The probe 204 includes an ultrasound transducer, or transducer array, 214 that slightly protrudes upward from the face 210. The transducer array 214 is overlaid by an acoustically transmissive covering (not shown). The array 214 is, by means of the covering and a coupling substance, such as an acoustically transmissive gel, configured for being acoustically coupled 216 to the skin 218 of a patient 220. As seen in FIG. 2 from the arrow pair 221, the array 214 can receive ultrasound to acquire radiofrequency (RF) data for photoacoustic imaging, emit ultrasound for ultrasonic imaging, and receive ultrasound bearing RF data for ultrasonic imaging. Behind each of the two windows 212, by a predetermined, inset distance 224, are the respective output ends of two optical fiber bundle branches 226. The optical fiber bundle 120 is bifurcated 228, within the probe 204, into the two branches 226. The branches 226 slightly bend toward each other in extending to deliver, along an optical path 230, the diffuse laser pulses 148 from opposite sides 150, 152 of the transducer array 214. Each of the two branches 226 is made up of sub-bundles 230 that run parallel to the lateral direction 232. Each sub-bundle 230 is comprised of a subset of the optical fibers 164 in its respective branch 226, and has an aperture size (or “diameter”) 229. The sub-bundles 230 each laterally span the entirety of the transducer array 214. Unlike in the embodiment of FIG. 1, both the solid-state wavelength conversion assembly 108 and the optical coupling system 116 are disposed within the probe 204. As part of regular maintenance the assembly 108 can be swapped out. Input to the assembly 108 is carried along an optical fiber bundle, or light pipe, from the pumping laser 112. Unlike in the embodiment of FIG. 1, where only a portion of an optical fiber bundle resides in the probe, the probe 204 of the current embodiment contains an entire optical fiber bundle. A probe 208 can instead deliver the wavelength-converted light via free-space optics, i.e., by a non-solid transmission medium, such as air. A bifurcating deflecting mirror directs light to curved mirrors on both sides, as shown by the arrows in the side view 206. The light-guide incorporating probe 209, shown in the side view 207, has a structure that appears similar to the bifurcated optical fiber bundle 120. However, the structure consists of two light guides (or “light pipes”) 236 into which a common light guide 238 is bifurcated. Alternatively, a single light guide can be shaped to surround the transducer. Another difference between the two side views 202, 207, is that the light-guide incorporating probe 209 is directly coupled to the wavelength conversion assembly 108. A design process 300 for any of the foregoing US/PA probes 124, 204, 208, 209 is shown in FIG. 3. The optimal laser beam diameter for delivering optical energy to an embedded target object in biological tissue has been described using Monte Carlo simulation in L. V. Wang, W. R. Chen, and R. E. Nordquist, “Optimal beam size for light delivery to absorption-enhanced tumors buried in biological tissues and effect of multiple beam delivery: a Monte Carlo study,” Applied Optics 36, 8286-8291 (1997), and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,099,554 to Nordquist et al. Both publications relate to thermal treatment and are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The methodology can also be applied to imaging. As discussed in the publications, the optimal radius (r) of the incident laser beam, i.e., at its incidence on the skin of a patient, is given by: [in-line-formulae]r=[δ(2dt−2Lt′+δ)]1/2 [/in-line-formulae]where δ is the optical penetration depth of the tissue, dt the distance from the center of the object to the tissue surface, Ĺt is one transport mean free path. The configuration of the optical fiber bundle 120 (output aperture size 229, position 224 within the probe 124, etc.) can be designed according to this formula to optimize the photoacoustic image for a specific depth, because the laser light emitted by the probe 124 diverges at a predictable rate. The optimal radius r is, as seen in both publications, a function of both the imaging depth dt and estimates of respective optical properties of body tissue in a path 230 of said photoacoustic imaging at said imaging depth. The optical properties are the absorption coefficient μa, the scattering coefficient μs, and the anisotropy g, whose estimations for given body tissue are well known. The formula for the optimal radius r is based on the geometry of a single, cross-sectional slice that extends along the central axis of the beam. This is demonstrated in FIG. 4 of the Wang publication. Since the beam may not be round, the actual axial-center-to-periphery distance in the plane of incidence generally varies around the periphery. The optimal radius r is therefore more generally referred to as the “size” of the beam at its incidence on the patient. The beam can be configured such that, for example, its average distance, over the entire periphery, equals its calculated “size r.” For the process 300, an imaging depth dt is selected (step S310). An estimate is made of the optical properties (step S320). An estimate is made of the divergence rate, from empirical experience for example (step S330). Based on dt, μa, μs, and g, the optimal beam size r is calculated (step S340). The aperture size 229 and the position 224 are calculated based on the optimal beam size r and the divergence rate (step S350). The first two steps (steps S310, S320) can be performed in either order. The divergence rate estimate (step S330) can be done any time prior to the bundle physical characteristics calculation step (S350). The probe 124 may also be designed to dynamically adapt to the targeted imaging depth dt defined by a current ultrasound setting. The setting might be a receive-beamforming input parameter, such as imaging depth or another operator-furnished parameter. Thus, the bundle branches 226 are advanced or retracted, thereby changing the inset distance 224, to optimize photoacoustic imaging at that depth. Fixed annular outer sleeves for the branches 226 are both pushed or pulled, correspondingly for advancement or retraction, by a probe-resident motorized mechanism that is responsive to the operator-furnished receive-beamforming input parameter. Because the branches 226, like the fibers 164, are flexible, slack within the probe 124 allows for the advancement and retraction. Therefore, the probe 124 is configured for dynamically adjusting an optical fiber 164, advancement- and retraction-wise, responsive to the targeted imaging depth. A further possibility is that the advancement/retraction instead rely on manual adjustment, in parallel for example, as by a graduated thumbwheel on the probe 124. FIG. 4 depicts one possible multiple dye cell and real-time wavelength-switching configuration 400 serving as a wavelength conversion assembly. For enhancement, a photoacoustic image acquired at one targeted, illumination wavelength 404 is subtracted from a photoacoustic image acquired at another targeted, illumination wavelength 408. This is similar to ultrasound pulse inversion imaging. The first targeted wavelength 404 is selected to be close to the methylene blue optical absorption peak of 665 nm, but may be greater than 640 nm and less than 690 nm. The second targeted wavelength 408 is selected so as to be effective for distinguishing an endogenous photoacoustic contrast source. An example would be hemoglobin (Hb), optically distinguishable from methylene blue with a wavelength between 700 and 900 nm, or melanin. Any endogenous source of photoacoustic contrast, in combination with any internally-introduced exogenous photoacoustic contrast agent, is within the intended scope of what is proposed herein. Likewise, targeted uptake or bearing of different photoacoustic agents by respective adjacent tissues may be distinguished. The switching configuration 400, in response to being pumped by an input laser beam 412 from the pump laser 112, outputs a laser beam 416 of the targeted wavelength to the optical coupling system 116. There, as discussed herein above, the beam 416 is conformed to the acceptance angle 160 of the constituent optical fibers 164 constituting the fiber bundle 120. The configuration 400 includes multiple dye cells. Two dye cells 420, 424 are shown in FIG. 4. The configuration 400 further includes optical switching and alignment optics. The optics includes two rotational beam-path alternators 428, 432, and four fixed deflecting minors 436, 440, 444, 448. Each alternator 428, 432 has two light-deflecting orientations, one shown in FIG. 4 as a solid line and the other shown as a broken line. The alternator 428, 432 may be implemented as a fast scanning mirror galvanometer used to switch the respective beam 412, 416 on consecutive laser shots to achieve the alternating laser wavelengths 404, 408. Other mechanisms can be used for beam deflection between the two dye cells 420, 424, such as a rotating prism as in a compact, liquid crystal on silicone (LCoS) engine. Switching between the two orientations occurs cyclically at a rate 452 of at least 10 hertz. It may occur every 10 milliseconds (ms), for example. The optics may be implemented instead only at the input or only at the output. Accordingly, the configuration 400 redirects at least one of: a) to the multiple dye cells 420, 424, a common input beam 412; and b) to a common optical coupling system 116 to the fiber optic bundle 120, output beams 416 from among respective ones of the multiple dye cells. Photoacoustic and ultrasonic imaging are interleaved for the compact laser, and efficient laser pulse delivery, device 100 as seen from FIG. 5. A pulse is fired from the first dye cell 420 (step S504). From the echoed back RF data a photoacoustic image is acquired (step S508). A pulse is fired from the second dye call 424 (step S512). From the echoed back RF data a photoacoustic image is acquired (step S516). By subtraction of one image from the other, a difference image is formed (step S520). Ultrasound is emitted and received to acquire a frame of ultrasound data (step S524). The ultrasound image and difference image are displayed (step S528). If a next image frame is to be displayed (step S532), the process repeats from the beginning at step S504. The subtraction step S520 and the ultrasound acquisition step S524 can be performed in either order. For the display step S528, the PA image may be superimposed on a grayscale B-mode ultrasound image. Or they may be displayed side-by-side. The combined B-mode/PA image may be displayed side-by-side with a Doppler image, such as a color flow image, or the color flow image can color code the combined image as an additional overlay. A photoacoustic medical-imaging device includes a wavelength conversion assembly configured for outputting laser pulses at a targeted wavelength. It also includes a photoacoustic probe configured for acoustic coupling to a patient, for directing the pulses, and for acquiring, in response, radiofrequency data for photoacoustic imaging. It may include an optical fiber bundle that comprises an optical fiber having an input end, and be configured for illuminating, with a homogenous beam, so as to conform to an acceptance angle of the fiber at that end. It may also include a light collimator, and a diffuser for receiving the outputted laser pulses from the collimator. The diffuser may be configured for spreading a focus of the pulsed light over an input aperture of the bundle to equalize the light received by different constituent optical fibers of the bundle. The assembly may include a dye cell, and may reside in the device. The photoacoustic medical-imaging device 100 has a broad range of applications related to optical imaging, especially photoacoustic imaging. Of particular interest is image-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy. It also has applications for cancer diagnosis/staging, imaging of angiogenesis, functional imaging (i.e. oxygen saturation and/or total concentration of hemoglobin), and treatment monitoring. The compact light delivery system also has application for photoacoustic molecular imaging, particularly for distinguishing contrast agents from background signals using spectroscopic photoacoustic imaging. While the invention has been illustrated and described in detail in the drawings and foregoing description, such illustration and description are to be considered illustrative or exemplary and not restrictive; the invention is not limited to the disclosed embodiments. For example, the optimal radius calculation, mentioned above in the context of the optical fiber sub-bundle 230, may instead be applied for configuring a probe-resident light pipe as to its radius and distance from the transducer/patient interface. Also, although pulse-echo ultrasound by a single probe is demonstrated, a setup requiring a second, remote ultrasound receiver of the probe-emitted ultrasound, or in which the probe receives ultrasound that is remotely emitted, is also covered within the scope of the claims below. Other variations to the disclosed embodiments can be understood and effected by those skilled in the art in practicing the claimed invention, from a study of the drawings, the disclosure, and the appended claims. In the claims, the word “comprising” does not exclude other elements or steps, and the indefinite article “a” or “an” does not exclude a plurality. Any reference signs in the claims should not be construed as limiting the scope. A computer program can be stored momentarily, temporarily or for a longer period of time on a suitable computer-readable medium, such as an optical storage medium or a solid-state medium. Such a medium is non-transitory only in the sense of not being a transitory, propagating signal, but includes other forms of computer-readable media such as register memory, processor cache, RAM and other volatile memory. A single processor or other unit may fulfill the functions of several items recited in the claims. The mere fact that certain measures are recited in mutually different dependent claims does not indicate that a combination of these measures cannot be used to advantage. 1.
