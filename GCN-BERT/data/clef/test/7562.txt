ii. 8-(1,3-Dimethylpyrazol-4-yl)-1-[3-fluoro-5-(methylsulfanylmethoxy)-2-pyridyl]-7-methoxy-3-methylimidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one (80 mg, 0.15 mmol, 95%), MeOH (5.00 ml) and a solution of potassium peroxodisulfate (220 mg, 0.77 mmol, 95%) in water (0.5 ml) was initially introduced in a 25 ml round-bottomed flask. The solution was stirred at 25Â° C. for 3 hours. The residue was pre-purified on silica gel with EtOAc:MeOH (70:30), and the crude product was purified by means of preparative HPLC, giving 15 mg (18%) of 8-(1,3-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1-(3-fluoro-5-methylsulfonylmethoxypyridin-2-yl)-7-methoxy-3-methyl-1,3-dihydroimidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-2-one as white solid.
