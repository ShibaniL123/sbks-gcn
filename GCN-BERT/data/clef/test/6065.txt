Example 2. Preparation of SM-2: 2-(2,2-difluoro-2-(fluorosulfonyl)acetamido)ethyl methacrylate
A 500 ml flask was charged with CH2Cl2 (80 ml) under nitrogen stream and stirred for 10 minutes at 0Â° C. and then 2-(fluorosulfonyl)difluoroacetyl fluoride (29.9 g, 166.0 mmol, 1.5 equivalent (eq.)) was added. After 25 minutes, a CH2Cl2 (160 ml) solution of 2-aminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride (18.4 g, 111.0 mmol, 1.0 eq.) and pyridine (17.5 g, 221.0 mmol, 2.0 eq.) was added dropwise to the mixture over 50 minutes. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature (RT) and stirred for 3 hours at RT. 1N HCl was added to the final reaction mixture and the lower layer was separated and subsequently washed with an additional amount of 1N HCl followed by brine. The solution was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered and the CH2Cl2 removed by an evaporator. The crude product was purified by recrystallization (hexane/CHCl3). The target compound was obtained as a white solid (20.4 g) in 64% yield.
