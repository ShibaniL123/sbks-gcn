GENETIC CORRECTION OF MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY TYPE 1 FIELD OF THE INVENTION Provided herein are compositions and methods for the treatment of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1 ). The present invention in particular relates to compositions and methods involving genetic correction of DM1 -derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) or its differentiated progeny, in particular muscle-like or myogenic cells, as well as in vitro and in vivo use of DM1 -derived iPS or its differentiated progeny, in particular musclelike or myogenic cells. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1 ) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder that afflicts 1 in 8000 individuals. There is currently no cure or effective treatment available. DM1 is not caused by expression of a mutant protein, but instead is due to expression of a pathogenic RNA. Indeed, expression of the mutated DMPK gene gives rise to an expanded repeat RNA (CUGexp) that is directly toxic to cells by interfering with splicing, expression and function of multiple target genes. The mutant RNA is retained in the nucleus, forming ribonuclear inclusions in affected tissue. Targeting the pathogenic CUGexp or preventing its expression represents one of the therapeutic strategies to treat DM1 . It has been shown recently that inhibition of the CUGexp could effectively inhibit the spliceopathy in myoblasts obtained from DM1 patients (Frangois et al. (201 1 ) Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 18, 85-87). Though cellular models may seem relatively straightforward to set up for screening therapeutic molecules, however, two major difficulties hamper the use of primary human cardiomyocytes or skeletal muscle progenitors cultures: the accessibility and availability of muscle biopsies from patients affected with DM1 , and the limited proliferative capacity of adult human primary cells such as myoblasts. It is particularly challenging to obtain large biopsies from patients and consequently to obtain a sufficient number of cells for extensive ex vivo studies. To overcome these limitations, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) can be used instead. Moreover, it is not known whether neutralization of the toxic effects of the DM1 CUGexp RNA would also restore the potentially lethal severe cardiac abnormalities in DM1 . Hence, it is also necessary to evaluate whether phenotypic correction of cardiac defects can be achieved, that typically contribute to significant mortality and morbidity in patients suffering from DM1 . There is currently no cure or effective treatment available for myotonic dystrophy and fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). Furthermore, there exists a need for tools in order to study and treat RNA-dominant genetic disorders such as myotonic dystrophy. A pilot experiment was published by Rodriguez et al (2014) Mol. ther. 22S1 , pS94 1 1 . The present invention aims at the treatment of RNA-dominant genetic disorders, as well as the consolidation of a novel platform technology to develop and validate novel therapeutic approaches for such disorders and to allow for a better understanding of the underlying biological defects. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present inventors have found that it is virtually impossible to expand DM1 patient derived precursor cells, such as myogenic cells (e.g. myoblasts or mesoangioblasts) or neuronal cells. While such cells may be isolated and to a certain extent propagated in vitro, after a few passages, the cells lose their proliferative capacity, and eventually die out. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it seems plausible that the toxic accumulation of defective DMPK mRNA may contribute to this effect. This undermines for instance the use of DM1 primary cells (such as muscle derived cells, be it myoblast or mesoangioblasts, or neuronal cells) for drug screening, disease investigation, and regenerative medicine. The present inventors have however, found that it is possible to derive induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) from cells originating from subjects afflicted with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1 ). More surprising, these DM1 patient derived iPS cells are capable of being differentiated into myogenic precursor cells, such as cardiomyogenic cells, myoblast- or mesoangioblast-like cells, or alternatively or neuronal or neurogenic cells. Importantly, and unexpectedly, both the DM1 derived iPS as well as the myogenic precursor cells derived therefrom display a DM1 specific phenotype, i.e. nuclear foci, which are characteristic for nuclear RNA accumulation associated with DM1 . The iPS-derived precursors, such as the myogenic or neurogenic precursors, provide for an unprecedented opportunity to replicate both normal and pathologic human tissue, such as muscle or nerve tissue, formation in vitro, that impacts on disease investigation, drug development and regenerative medicine. The availability of such platform overcomes some of the bottlenecks intrinsic to the use of patient-derived primary cells, such as myoblasts or mesoangioblasts, but also neuronal or neurogenic cells, which have a much more restricted life-span. An additional important advantage of the DM1 derived iPS, in particular the nuclear foci phenotype, is that differentiation of cellular commitment, such as myogenic or neurogenic commitment, is not necessary if drug screening purposes can be done from the DM1 undifferentiated iPS cells. In addition, the present inventors have found that DM1 - derived iPS, as well as the precursors derived therefrom, such as the myogenic or neurogenic precursors derived therefrom, are less fragile than primary DM1 -derived cells, such as primary myogenic or neurogenic cells, and can advantageously be subjected to gene transfer, with minimal loss of cell death and proliferative capacity, in contrast to primary DM1 -derived cells, which experience a vast amount of cell death and the surviving cells often even fail to grow anymore after transfection. In view of the limited proliferative capacity of primary DM1 -derived cells, their possible application for transplantation is severely limited. In contrast, the DM1 -derived iPS and their progeny, such as myogenic or neurogenic progeny, provide for a more robust cell system platform, which, in view of their continued proliferative capacity, may be readily used not only for a variety of in vitro assays, but also for transplantation, for instance after in vitro and in vivo gene correction.

It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilised and structural or logical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims. In an aspect, the present invention relates to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) derived from cells originating from a subject having myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1 ). The term "myotonic dystrophy" has its meaning as is known in the art. By means of further guidance, this term generally refers to a chronic, slowly progressing, highly variable, inherited multisystemic disease characterized by wasting of the muscles (muscular dystrophy), cataracts, heart conduction defects, endocrine changes, and myotonia. Two types of myotonic dystrophy exist. Table 1 illustrates the differences between the myotonic dystrophy of type 1 and type 2. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1 ), also called Steinert disease, has a severe congenital form and a milder childhood- onset form. Myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), also called proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM) or adult-onset form, is rarer than DM1 and generally manifests with milder signs and symptoms. Myotonic dystrophy can occur in patients of any age. Both forms of the disease display an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Table 1 The term " myotonic dystrophy type 1 " or " DM1 " generally refers to a rare hereditary disorder of the neuromuscular and locomotor system caused by the expansion of the cytosine-thymine-guanine (CTG) triplet repeat located in the 3'- untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the dystrophy myotonic-protein kinase (DMPK) gene. In DM1 patients, the skeletal muscle is severely affected with progressive muscle wasting and myotonia being two of the major clinical manifestations of this disease together with a progressive decline in maximal force production which represents one of the most disabling aspects of the disease. Moreover, cardiac arrhythmias and sudden death are a major cause of mortality in DM1 patients, even in young patients with limited muscle problems. In DM1 , RNA that is transcribed from DNA containing non-coding expansions is causative of disease pathogenesis. The expanded allele is transcribed to produce RNA containing expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that becomes stuck in nuclear foci, precluding its export to the cytoplasm for translation into DMPK protein. Although loss of DMPK contributes to the disease, toxicity of CUGexp RNA plays the major role. CUGexp RNA folds into an imperfect hairpin structure that resembles the natural binding site for the protein muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1 ). MBNL is consequently sequestered by the RNA, not only resulting in loss of its normal function in RNA splicing, but enhancing formation of foci that trap CUGexp RNA in the nucleus. Another component of pathogenicity is aberrant activation of protein kinase C, which leads to increased activity of a second splicing regulator, CUG-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1 ). Both MBNL1 and CUGBP1 coordinately regulate the alternative splicing of pre-mRNA during development. CUGexp RNA disrupts this program, resulting in the aberrant expression of embryonic splicing patterns in adult tissues. One of the best- characterized misregulated splicing events in DM1 is of the RNA encoding the muscle- specific chloride channel (CLCN1 ). The altered splicing of CLCN1 results in the loss of this channel in DM1 patients. This results in skeletal muscle hyperexcitability, causing the myotonia for which the disease is named. Recently, the misregulation of BIN1 was also associated to the progressive weakness observed in muscle of the DM1 patients. However the role of many of the other mis-splicing events in the DM1 physiopathology is not yet fully understood. Finally, an additional mechanism related to RNA toxicity resulting from the activation of a transcription factor (i.e. Nkx 2.5) or the deregulation of miR1 biogenesis has been proposed as new pathways contributing to DM1 pathogenesis. Between 5 and 37 CUG repeats is considered normal, while individuals with between 38 and 49 repeats are considered to have a pre-mutation and are at risk of having children with further expanded repeats and, therefore, symptomatic disease. Individuals with greater than 50 repeats are almost invariably symptomatic. Patients suffering from DM1 typically have CTG repeat expansions ranging from 50 to more than 2500. Longer repeats are usually associated with earlier onset and more severe disease. The number of repeats increases over successive generations and provides the molecular basis for the anticipation phenomenon observed in DM1 families. DMPK alleles with greater than 37 repeats are unstable and additional trinucleotide repeats may be inserted during cell division in mitosis and meiosis. Consequently, the children of individuals with premutations or mutations inherit DMPK alleles which are longer than their parents and therefore are more likely to be affected or display an earlier onset and greater severity of the condition, a phenomenon known as anticipation. Interestingly, paternal transmission of the condition is very uncommon, possibly due to selection pressures against sperm with expanded repeats, but anticipation tends to be less severe than in cases of maternal inheritance. The term "DM1 patient" or "subject having DM1 " as used herein refers to a subject having a mutation in the DMPK gene known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion. Typically, DM1 patients have at least 50 CTG repeats in the trinucleotide repeat expansion of the DMPK gene. Subjects having 35 to 49 CTG repeats have not been reported to develop DM1 , but their children are at risk of having the disorder if the number of CTG repeats increases. Repeat lengths from 35 to 49 are called premutations. The term "subject having a pre-mutation for DM1 " refers to a subject having 35 to 49 CTG repeats in the trinucleotide repeat expansion of the DMPK gene. In an embodiment, the term "DM1 patient" or "subject having DM1 " refers to a subject having at least 50 CTG repeats in the trinucleotide repeat expansion of the DMPK gene. In another embodiment, the term "DM1 patient" or "subject having DM1 " refers to a subject having at least 35 CTG repeats in the trinucleotide repeat expansion of the DMPK gene. In certain embodiments, the term "DM1 patient" or "subject having DM1 " may thus encompass subjects having pre-mutations, which are generally (still) asymptomatic. The term "myotonic dystrophy protein kinase", "DMPK", or "dystrophia myotonica- protein kinase" generally refers to a protein expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle. The gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 19. The cytogenetic location of the DMPK gene is 19q13.3. The present inventor have here for the first time demonstrated that genetic correction of DM1 with a high efficiency, in particular by designer nucleases is feasible. As DM1 is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, it may be expected that the present invention may also be applicable to other types of autosomal dominant genetic disorders. Therefore, in certain embodiments, when referring to DM1 , such may be replaced by another autosomal dominant genetic disorder. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, when referring to DM1 , such may be replaced by a disorder selected from the group comprising or consisting of Acropectoral syndrome, Acute intermittent porphyria, Adermatoglyphia, Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy, Arakawa's syndrome II, Aromatase excess syndrome, Autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia, Axenfeld syndrome, Bethlem myopathy, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, Boomerang dysplasia, Branchio-oto-renal syndrome, Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome, Camurati-Engelmann disease, Central core disease, Collagen disease, Collagenopathy, types II and XI, Congenital distal spinal muscular atrophy, Congenital stromal corneal dystrophy, Costello syndrome, Currarino syndrome, Darier's disease, De Vivo disease, Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis, DiGeorge syndrome, Dysfibrinogenemia, Transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis, Familial atrial fibrillation, Familial hypercholesterolemia, Familial male-limited precocious puberty, Feingold syndrome, Felty's syndrome, Flynn-Aird syndrome, Gardner's syndrome, Gillespie syndrome, Gray platelet syndrome, Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome, Hajdu-Cheney syndrome, Hawkinsinuria, Hay-Wells syndrome, Hereditary elliptocytosis, Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, Hereditary mucoepithelial dysplasia, Hereditary spherocytosis, Holt-Oram syndrome, Huntington's disease, Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, Hypoalphalipoproteinemia, Jackson-Weiss syndrome, Keratolytic winter erythema, Kniest dysplasia, Kostmann syndrome, Langer-Giedion syndrome, Larsen syndrome, Liddle's syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Marshall syndrome, Medullary cystic kidney disease, Metachondromatosis, Miller— Dieker syndrome, MOMO syndrome, Monilethrix, Multiple endocrine neoplasia, Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 , Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2, Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b, Myelokathexis, Myotonic dystrophy, Naegeli-Franceschetti-Jadassohn syndrome, Nail-patella syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, Pachyonychia congenita, Pallister— Hall syndrome, PAPA syndrome, Papillorenal syndrome, Parastremmatic dwarfism, Pelger-Huet anomaly, Peutz- Jeghers syndrome, Piebaldism, Platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasia, Torrance type, Popliteal pterygium syndrome, Porphyria cutanea tarda, RASopathy, Reis-Bucklers corneal dystrophy, Romano-Ward syndrome, Rosselli— Gulienetti syndrome, Roussy- Levy syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, Saethre-Chotzen syndrome, Schmitt Gillenwater Kelly syndrome, Short QT syndrome, Singleton Merten syndrome, Spinal muscular atrophy with lower extremity predominance, Spinocerebellar ataxia, Spinocerebellar ataxia type-6, Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, Strudwick type, Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, Spondyloperipheral dysplasia, Stickler syndrome, Tietz syndrome, Timothy syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, Tuberous sclerosis, Upington disease, Variegate porphyria, Vitelliform macular dystrophy, Von Hippel-Lindau disease, Von Willebrand disease, Wallis— Zieff— Goldblatt syndrome, WHIM syndrome, White sponge nevus, Worth syndrome, Zaspopathy, Zimmermann- Laband syndrome, Zori-Stalker-Williams syndrome. It will be appreciated that the target sequences and constructs as described herein for DM1 can be adapted accordingly to accommodate genetic correction of the above listed disorders. The term "induced pluripotent stem cells" or "iPS" refers to pluripotent stem cell that can be generated directly from adult cells, in particular somatic cells. iPS may for instance be generated as described in Yamanaka et al. 2006 (Cell 126, 663-676), Yamanaka et al. 2007 (Cell 131 , 861 -872) and Lin et al. 2009 (Nature Methods 6, 805- 808). Similar to embryonic stem cells (ESCs), iPS show unlimited self-renewal and demonstrated pluripotency by contributing to lineages from all three germ layers in the context of embryoid bodies, teratomas, fetal chimeras. By means of further guidance, iPS may be generated from somatic cells by expressing Oct4, Sox2, cMyc, and Klf4. Primary cells may be transduced or transfected by any means known in the art, such as for instance by viral vectors such as retroviral and lentiviral vectors, electroporation with plasmids encoding Myc, Klf4, Oct4 and Sox2, which adequately express these reprogramming factors. The skilled person will appreciate that while this combination of reprogramming factors is most conventional in producing iPS, each of the factors can be functionally replaced by related transcription factors, miRNAs, small molecules, or even non-related genes such as lineage specifiers. Characteristic pluripotency markers for iPS cells are among others OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, hTERT, SSEA4 etc. Verification of the expression of these markers may validate the successful generation of iPS. In a preferred embodiment, the iPS as referred to herein are mammalian iPS, preferably human iPS. Accordingly, cells originating from a subject having myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1 ) in certain embodiments refers to cells originating from a mammalian subject having myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1 ), preferably a human subject having myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1 ). Except when noted differently, the terms "subject" or "patient" are used interchangeably and refer to animals, preferably vertebrates, more preferably mammals, and specifically includes human patients and non-human mammals, "mammalian" subjects include, but are not limited to, humans, domestic animals, commercial animals, farm animals, zoo animals, sport animals, pet and experimental animals such as dogs, cats, guinea pigs, rabbits, rats, mice, horses, cattle, cows; primates such as apes, monkeys, orang-utans, and chimpanzees; canids such as dogs and wolves; felids such as cats, lions, and tigers; equids such as horses, donkeys, and zebras; food animals such as cows, pigs, and sheep; ungulates such as deer and giraffes; rodents such as mice, rats, hamsters and guinea pigs; and so on. Accordingly, "subject" or "patient" as used herein means any mammalian patient or subject to which the compositions of the invention can be administered. Preferred patients or subjects are human subjects. The present methods and protocols may preferably depart from iPS which are "undifferentiated", i.e., wherein a substantial proportion (for example, at least about 60%, preferably at least about 70%, even more preferably at least about 80%, still more preferably at least about 90% and up to 100%) of cells in the stem cell population display characteristics (e.g., morphological features and/or markers) of undifferentiated iPS cells, clearly distinguishing them from cells undergoing differentiation. Undifferentiated iPS cells are generally easily recognised by those skilled in the art, and may appear in the two dimensions of a microscopic view with high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratios and prominent nucleoli, may grow as compact colonies with sharp borders. It is understood that colonies of undifferentiated cells within the population may often be surrounded by neighbouring cells that are more differentiated. Nevertheless, the undifferentiated colonies persist when the population is cultured or passaged under appropriate conditions known per se, and individual undifferentiated cells constitute a substantial proportion of the cell population. By means of further guidance, iPS identity may also be verified by various cellular biological properties. iPS may for instance express typical stem cell markers, such as SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1 - 60, TRA-1 -81 , TRA-2-49/6E, and Nanog. iPS typically also demonstrate high telomerase activity and express hTERT. Further, iPS are mitotically active, actively self-renewing, proliferating, and dividing at a rate equal or similar to ESCs. In an aspect, the invention relates to cells originating from a subject having myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1 ), in which cells the expression of an expanded repeat RNA (CUGexp) of the dystrophy myotonic-protein kinase (DMPK) gene is reduced or eliminated. As used herein, the reduction or elimination of the expanded repeat RNA of the DMPK gene in cells may also be referred to as genetically corrected cells. According to the invention, any cell type derived from a subject having DM1 may be used in the methods for genetic targeting and compositions as described herein. The genetic targeting may be performed on any such cell type derived from a subject having DM1 , but also on cells derived from these, such as iPS. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the genetic targeting as described herein may be performed on iPS cells derived from any cell type originating from a subject having DM1 . In certain embodiments, the genetic targeting as described herein may also be performed on further downstream cells derived from the cells originating from a subject having DM1 , such as cells derived from iPS cells which in their turn are derived from cells originating from a subject having DM1 . Such downstream cells may be precursor or progenitor cells, which are to a certain extent already lineage committed, but nevertheless retain a certain degree of proliferative capacity, as is known in the art. In certain embodiments, the cells to be used for the genetic targeting as described herein may be myogenic cells, which may in certain embodiments be primary myogenic cells or iPS-derived myogenic cells. In certain other embodiments, the cells to be used for the genetic targeting as described herein may be neurogenic cells, which may in certain embodiments be primary neurogenic cells or iPS-derived neurogenic cells. In certain embodiments, the cells as referred to herein are muscle cells (e.g. skeletal muscle cells), heart cells (e.g. cardiomyocytes), eye cells (e.g. lens epithelial cells) or brain cells (e.g. neurons), progenitor or precursor cells from which these cells are the progeny, iPS cells derived therefrom (i.e. from the precursor/progenitor cells, for instance myoblasts or mesoangioblasts, or the progeny of these cells), or the progeny thereof, such as iPS-derived progenitor or precursor cells, which may in certain embodiments be myogenic or neurogenic progenitors/precursors, or their partially or fully differentiated progeny. According to certain embodiments, the invention relates to the use of the above described cells (i.e. the cells which have been genetically corrected) for the treatment of DM1 . In certain embodiments, the invention relates to the above described cells (i.e. the cells which have been genetically corrected) for use in the treatment of DM1 . In certain embodiments, the invention relates to a method for treating DM1 , comprising administering the above described cells (i.e. the cells which have been genetically corrected). In certain embodiments, the invention relates to the use of the above described cells (i.e. the cells which have been genetically corrected) for the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of DM1 . As used herein, "myoblasts" and "mesoangioblasts" refer to primary cells of mesodermal origin. Both myoblasts and mesoangioblasts are progenitor cells. These cells are multipotent and can differentiate or can be induced to differentiate into a variety of cell types, such as for instance myogenic or cardiomyogenic differentiation into for instance myocytes. As used herein "myoblast-like" and mesoangioblast-like" cells refer to cells having morphological or functional characteristics similar to respectively myoblasts or mesoangioblasts. Importantly, myoblast-like and mesoangioblast-like cells are also capable of myogenic or cardiomyogenic differentiation into for instance myocytes. Similarly, "muscle-like" or "neuronal-like" cells refer to cells having morphological or functional characteristics similar to respectively muscle cells or neuronal cells. Characteristic markers for the specific cell types as used herein can verify the identity of the cells. HIDEMs or Mesangioblastscan for instance be characterized as follows: CD13 positive,CD31 negative, CD44 positive, CD56 negative, CD49b positive, CD45 negative, SSEA4 negative. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the cells as used herein may be characterized by one or more of the following: CD13 positive, CD31 negative, CD44 positive, CD56 negative, CD49b positive, CD45 negative, SSEA4 negative, preferably at least two of the above, more preferably at least 3, even more preferably at least 4, 5, or 6, most preferably all of the above. Mature Myotubes or myocytes can for instance be characterized by expression of Myosin Heavy Chain (MyHC). Myoblasts (or myoblast-like cells) can for instance be characterized by expression of MyoD and/or myogenin, preferably both. Alternatively, myoblasts can for instance be identified by expression of one or more of the following markers:, Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), ADAM12, alpha- and beta-tropomyosin (pT), normally concentrated in myotubes. PMID: 6301863, beta-Enolase, CD56, Desmin, Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), M-Cadherin (muscle cadherin), M-Calpain, M-CAM (melanoma cell adhesion molecule), MRF4 (myogenic/muscle regulating factor-4), Myf-5 (muscle regulatory factor-5), MyoD, Myogenin, Myosin, N-Cadherin (neural cadherin), Phosphoprotein (pp(65;4.5)), Pax3, Pax7, PK-K (K-isozyme of pyruvate kinase), PK-M (M-isozyme of pyruvate kinase), Tbx3, Titin, one or more of which may be used in certain embodiments to identify myoblasts or myoblast-like cells as described herein. Preferably at least two of the above, more preferably at least 3, even more preferably at least 4, 5, or 6, such as all of the above markers are present on the myoblasts or myoblast-like cells as described herein. The present methods and protocols may depart from such myoblast-like or mesoangioblast-like cells or alternatively from neuronal or neurogenic cells which are not pluripotent anymore, but which are neither terminally differentiated, i.e., wherein a substantial proportion (for example, at least about 60%, preferably at least about 70%, even more preferably at least about 80%, still more preferably at least about 90% and up to 100%) of cells cell population display characteristics (e.g., morphological features and/or markers) clearly distinguishing them from the iPS and/or cells undergoing terminal differentiation. The terms "progenitor" or "precursor" refer generally to an unspecialized or relatively less specialized and proliferation-competent cell which can under appropriate conditions give rise to at least one relatively more specialized cell type, such as inter alia to relatively more specialized progenitor cells or eventually to terminally differentiated cells, i.e., fully specialized cells that may be post-mitotic. A progenitor or stem cell is said to "give rise" to another, relatively more specialized cell when, for example, the progenitor or stem cell differentiates to become said other cell without previously undergoing cell division, or if said other cell is produced after one or more rounds of cell division and/or differentiation of the progenitor or stem cell. As used herein, the terms "differentiation", "differentiating" or derivatives thereof denote the process by which an unspecialized or relatively less specialized cell, such as, for example, stem cell or progeny thereof, becomes relatively more specialized. In the context of cell ontogeny, the adjective "differentiated" is a relative term. Hence, a "differentiated cell" is a cell that has progressed further down a certain developmental pathway than the cell it is being compared with. The differentiated cell may, for example, be a terminally differentiated cell, i.e., a fully specialized cell capable of taking up specialized functions in various tissues or organs of an organism, which may but need not be post-mitotic; or the differentiated cell may itself be a progenitor cell within a particular differentiation lineage which can further proliferate and/or differentiate. A relatively more specialized cell may differ from an unspecialized or relatively less specialized cell in one or more demonstrable phenotypic characteristics, such as, for example, the presence, absence or level of expression of particular cellular components or products, e.g., RNA, proteins or other substances, activity of certain biochemical pathways, morphological appearance, proliferation capacity and/or kinetics, differentiation potential and/or response to differentiation signals, electrophysiological behavior, etc., wherein such characteristics signify the progression of the relatively more specialized cell further along the said developmental pathway. The term "(cardio)myogenic differentiation", "differentiation into myoblast-like or mesoangioblast- like cells" or the likes means the formation of (cardio)myocytes from stem cells, such as iPS. Formation of (cardio) myocytes is defined by the formation of contracting embryoid bodies (EBs), contracting seeded cells, immune cytological staining for cardiomyocyte specific marker, and expression of (cardio) myocyte specific marker. Such differentiation may be accomplished by subjecting cells to a "medium permissive to differentiation of stem cells", which means that the medium does not contain components, in sufficient quantity, which would suppress stem cell differentiation or would cause maintenance and/or proliferation of stem cells in undifferentiated or substantially undifferentiated state. By means of illustration, such components absent from the medium may include leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), and/or embryonic fibroblast feeders or conditioned medium of such feeders. The above applies equally mutatis mutandis to "neurogenic differentiation" or "neuronal differentiation". In a further aspect, the invention relates to precursor cells derived from, differentiated from, obtained from, or generated from the iPS as defined herein, i.e. precursor cells derived from iPS originating from a subject having DM1 . In related aspects, the invention relates to a method for differentiating the iPS as defined herein into precursor cells; or the use of the iPS as defined herein for differentiating, generating, obtaining, or giving rise to precursor cells. In certain embodiments, the precursor cells are myogenic precursor cells. In certain other embodiments, the precursor cells are neurogenic precursor cells. As used herein, "myogenic precursor cells" is synonymous with "myogenic progenitor cells", and refers to cells which are capable of directly differentiating into muscle cells, such as myocytes, or indirectly into other cell types which in their turn may directly or indirectly differentiate into muscle cells. In certain embodiments, the iPS as defined herein may undergo myogenic differentiation such as to form myoblast-like cells or mesoangioblast-like cells. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the invention relates to myoblast-like cells or mesoangioblast-like cells derived from, differentiated from, obtained from, or generated from the iPS as defined herein, i.e. myogenic precursor cells derived from iPS originating from a subject having DM1 . In related embodiments, the invention relates to a method for differentiating the iPS as defined herein into myoblast-like cells or mesoangioblast-like cells; or the use of the iPS as defined herein for differentiating, generating, obtaining, or giving rise to myoblast-like cells or mesoangioblast-like cells. As used herein, "neurogenic precursor cells" is synonymous with "neurogenic progenitor cells", and refers to cells which are capable of directly differentiating into neuronal cells, such as neurons, or indirectly into other cell types which in their turn may directly or indirectly differentiate into neuronal cells. In certain embodiments, the iPS as defined herein may undergo neurogenic differentiation such as to form neuron-like cells. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the invention relates to neuron-like cells or neuronal-like cells derived from, differentiated from, obtained from, or generated from the iPS as defined herein, i.e. neuronal or neurogenic precursor cells derived from iPS originating from a subject having DM1 . In related embodiments, the invention relates to a method for differentiating the iPS as defined herein into neuronal- or neurogenic-like cells or neuron-like cells; or the use of the iPS as defined herein for differentiating, generating, obtaining, or giving rise to neuron- or neuronal-like cells or neurogenic-like cells. In another aspect, the present invention relates to cells originating from a subject having myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1 ), for example, but not limited to the iPS as defined herein, or the precursor cells derived therefrom (such as myogenic or neurogenic precursors, as described herein elsewhere, in which the expression of an expanded repeat RNA (CUGexp) of the dystrophy myotonic-protein kinase (DMPK) gene is reduced or eliminated. As defined herein elsewhere, DM1 patients have an expanded repeat RNA in the 3'UTR of the DMPK gene, in which the CTG triplet is repeated in a greater number than in subjects not having DM1 . Upon transcription of such DM1 DMPK allele, a transcript is generated which typically comprises at least 35 CUG repeats, preferably at least 50 CUG repeats. According to certain embodiments, the expression of such mutant DMPK allele having at least 35 CTG repeats, preferably at least 50 CTG repeats is reduced or eliminated. As referred to herein, "reduced" or "eliminated" expression encompasses both a reduced or eliminated transcription of the mutant DMPK gene, such that less or (substantially) no mRNA is formed, as well as an increased breakdown of the mutant mRNA, such as to eliminate partially or (substantially) completely already formed mRNA or increase mRNA turnover. Alternatively, for instance partial or (substantially) complete sequestration of the mutant mRNA is also envisaged, in order for the mRNA to be prevented from exploiting its pathogenicity, such as to prevent interference of the mutant mRNA with splicing. A reduction of the expression of the mutant mRNA preferably refers to at least 10% (on weight basis) less functional pathogenic mRNA being present in the cell compared to non-reduced conditions, more preferably at least 30%, even more preferably at least 50%, yet more preferably at least 70%. Elimination of the expression of the mutant mRNA preferably refers to at least 80% (on weight basis) less functional pathogenic mRNA being present in the cell compared to non-reduced conditions, more preferably at least 90%, even more preferably at least 95%, such as 98%, or 100% or substantially 100%. Means for reducing or eliminating expression of mRNA are well known in the art, all of which can be used in certain embodiment of the invention. In a preferred embodiment, the reduction or elimination of the expression of said expanded repeat RNA (CUGexp) of the DMPK gene is effected by introducing in said cells a designer nuclease specifically targeting the DMPK gene or locus, preferably a designer endonuclease, more preferably a designer endodeoxyribonuclease. Preferably, the nuclease generates double strand breaks in DNA, such as genomic DNA. As used herein, a "designer nuclease" is a multicomponent polypeptide, typically comprising a site specific polynucleotide binding moiety, which may be a polynucleotide recognizing peptide or alternatively an oligo- or polynucleotide, and which is attached to or associated with a nuclease moiety. The polynucleotide binding moiety targets the nuclease to a specific site on the polynucleotide, such that a site- specific cut can be made in the polynucleotide. The nuclease itself, were it not for being fused to or associated with the site specific polynucleotide binding moiety, does not possess site-specificity. Designer nucleases are generally engineered in order to provide target specific recognition and cleavage. Accordingly, "specifically targeting the DMPK gene" refers to site-specific binding of the nuclease (i.e. the site specific polynucleotide binding moiety which is fused to or associated with the nuclease) to a sequence of the DMPK gene. Such sequence may be a regulatory sequence, such as the DMPK promoter, an intron, an exon, an intron/exon boundary, 5'-UTR, 3'-UTR, etc. By inserting a DNA double-strand break (DSB) into the target locus rare-cutting designer nucleases activate DNA repair, which can be harnessed to knockout genes or to promote gene targeting. At least five families of designer nucleases have been documented so far: Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs), meganucleases (MNs), chemical nucleases, Transcription Activator-Like Nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR/Cas nucleases. All these nucleases may be used according to certain embodiments of the invention. In the methods of the present invention be it at the promoter region of the DMPK gene or the 3'UTR where the CTG repeat regions are removed, the healthy or the mutant allele can both be targeted. Because the homologous sequence in the guideRNA are the same in both health or mutant allele. The only difference is the distance between two guideRNA flanking the CTG repeat in a healthy allele is smaller than the mutant allele since the mutant allele has the long stretch of CTG repeats between the two targeting sites of the guideRNA. The present invention, relating to the reduction of CTG repeats in the DMPK gene in the genome of a cell of a DM1 patient is illustrated with the TALEN and CRISPR/Cas technology. Based on the teaching of the present application, the skilled person can apply this teaching to other genome specific nuclease systems such as Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs), meganucleases (MNs), chemical nucleases. In a preferred embodiment, the nuclease comprises a designer transcription activator- like effector nuclease (dTALEN or TALEN). TALENs are composed of the Fokl nuclease fused to the TALE domains that determine the specificity of TALEN binding. The TALEs central domain contains a variable number of tandem, 34-amino acid repeats. This repeat domain was previously shown to bind specific DNA sequences in promoter regions of target genes. Amino acid sequences of the repeats are conserved, except for two adjacent highly variable residues (at positions 12 and 13) that are specificity determinants defined as the repeat-variable diresidue (RVD). A simple one- to-one code had been deduced relating specific diamino acids in the repeat unit to specific nucleotides in the DNA target. Remarkably, the RVDs of TALE correspond directly to the nucleotides in their target sites, one RVD to one nucleotide. The generic TALE structure and TALE code is shown in Figure 21 . As the Fokl nuclease needs to dimerize in order to generate double strand breaks, two TALEs - each fused to a Fokl - are needed: a left TALE and a right TALE. Accordingly, a functional dTALEN as used herein, may comprise and preferably comprises a left TALE and a right TALE (each fused to Fokl), each of which is capable of recognizing respectively a left target (or left TALE target) sequence and a right target (or right TALE target) sequence. According to certain embodiments, the dTALEN (interchangeably used with TALEN or TALE, and which may comprise the left TALE and the right TALE) as referred to herein is capable of targeting or binding to the DMPK locus. The term "locus" is known in the art. By means of further guidance, the DMPK locus refers to the physical location of the DMPK gene on the chromosome. The DMPK locus encompasses both the transcribed parts of the gene, being it introns, exons, 5'-UTR, or 3' UTR, as well as the associated regulatory sequences, such as promoters, enhancers, etc. In a preferred embodiment, the nuclease comprises an RNA based designer nuclease, preferably a clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/Cas- based RNA-guided DNA endonuclease. The CRISPR/Cas system finds its origin in prokaryotes, which have evolved an adaptive defense mechanism that uses CRISPR, together with Cas proteins, to renders them resistance to invading viruses and plasmids. The original prokaryotic type II CRISPR-Cas system results in the specific cleavage of incoming exogenous DNA fragments by the Cas9 endonuclease that is directed to this DNA sequence using complementary RNAs. Based on this CRISPR- Cas system, RNA-Guided Endonucleases (RGENs) can be designed that can be used to perform targeted genome editing at the desired loci. Recent work has shown that CRISPR/Cas systems can be engineered to direct targeted double-stranded DNA breaks in vitro to specific sequences by using a single "guide RNA" with complementarity to the DNA target site and a Cas9 nuclease (Jinek et al., Science (2012) Science 337, 816-821 ). This targetable Cas9-based system also works efficiently in cultured human cells (Mali et al. (2013) Science 339, 823-826; Cong et al., (2013) Science 339, 819-823). In essence, the CRISPR/Cas system uses a single or double synthetic non-coding nucleotide guide RNA (gRNA) that uses 20 variable nucleotides at its 5' end to base pair with a target polynucleotide region. The remaining gRNA scaffold interacts with and redirects the Cas9 nuclease to the target site. Target sequences are generally at least 20 bp in length and must be followed by an appropriate protospace-adjacent motif (PAM) on their 3' end. These designer nucleases then typically activate DNA repair resulting in a specific gene knockout through non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Moreover, in the presence of a homologous gene sequence, targeted integration of the gene of interest can be achieved in the target locus by homologous recombination. As used herein, the terms "CRISPR" and "guide RNA" or "gRNA" are to a certain extent used interchangeably. Whereas "guide RNA" or "gRNA" specifically relate to an RNA sequence, "CRISPR" may relate both to an RNA or DNA sequence. However, when referring to "CRISPR" or "guide RNA/gRNA" in a specific context, these terms relate to a similar sequence, being it either DNA or RNA, in which T is replaced by U. As used herein, and unless specified otherwise, when referring to a CRISPR sequence, such sequence may be single stranded or double stranded, and may be DNA or RNA. Figure 33 shows a representation of the complex formed by guide RNA molecule, Cas9 nuclease and genomic DNA. The guide RNA molecule consists of a "target sequence" specifically binding to genomic target DNA and a "scaffold sequence" which forms hairpins and binds with the Cas9 nuclease protein. The length of the target sequence of the guide RNA which specifically binds with the genomic ranges from 17 to 23 nucleotides. As used herein, "Cas" refers to CRISPR associated nuclease. Cas may be obtained from a variety of prokaryotic sources. In certain preferred embodiments, the Cas as referred to herein is Cas9, preferably a codon-optimized Cas or Cas9, such as a human codon-optimized Cas or Cas9. In certain embodiments, the Cas as referred to herein has a sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 44, or a homologue, functional variant or functional fragment thereof. In certain embodiments, the Cas as referred to herein is cloned into an expression vector having a sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 59, or a homologue, functional variant or functional fragment thereof. In addition, one amino acid mutation at position D10A in Cas9 results in the inactivation of the nuclease catalytic activity and converts Cas9 to a "nickase" enzyme that makes single- stranded breaks at the target site, which may also be used, although not preferred, according to certain embodiments of the invention. According to certain embodiments, the CRISPR as referred to herein is capable of targeting or binding to the DMPK locus. The term "locus" is known in the art. By means of further guidance, the DMPK locus refers to the physical location of the DMPK gene on the chromosome. The DMPK locus encompasses both the transcribed parts of the gene, being it introns, exons, 5'-UTR, or 3' UTR, as well as the associated regulatory sequences, such as promoters, enhancers, etc. A "regulatory sequence" or "regulatory element" as used herein refers to transcriptional control elements, in particular non-coding cis-acting transcriptional control elements, capable of regulating and/or controlling transcription of a gene, in particular tissue- specific transcription of a gene. Regulatory elements comprise at least one transcription factor binding site (TFBS), more in particular at least one binding site for a tissue-specific transcription factor, most particularly at least one binding site for a liver- specific transcription factor. Typically, regulatory elements as used herein increase or enhance promoter-driven gene expression when compared to the transcription of the gene from the promoter alone, without the regulatory elements. Thus, regulatory elements particularly comprise enhancer sequences, although it is to be understood that the regulatory elements enhancing transcription are not limited to typical far upstream enhancer sequences, but may occur at any distance of the gene they regulate. Indeed, it is known in the art that sequences regulating transcription may be situated either upstream (e.g. in the promoter region) or downstream (e.g. in the 3'UTR) of the gene they regulate in vivo, and may be located in the immediate vicinity of the gene or further away. Of note, although regulatory elements as disclosed herein typically are naturally occurring sequences, combinations of (parts of) such regulatory elements or several copies of a regulatory element, i.e. non-naturally occurring sequences, are themselves also envisaged as regulatory element. Regulatory elements as used herein may be part of a larger sequence involved in transcriptional control, e.g. part of a promoter sequence. However, regulatory elements alone are typically not sufficient to initiate transcription, but require a promoter to this end. As used in the application, the term "promoter" refers to nucleic acid sequences that regulate, either directly or indirectly, the transcription of corresponding nucleic acid coding sequences to which they are operably linked (e.g. a transgene or endogenous gene). A promoter may function alone to regulate transcription or may act in concert with one or more other regulatory sequences (e.g. enhancers or silencers). In the context of the present application, a promoter is typically operably linked to regulatory elements to regulate transcription of a transgene. In certain embodiments, the dTALEN as referred to herein targets/binds or is capable of targeting/binding to the DMPK promoter. In other embodiments, the dTALEN as referred to herein targets/binds or is capable of targeting/binding to a DMPK enhancer. In other embodiments, the dTALEN as referred to herein targets/binds or is capable of targeting/binding to a DMPK exon. In other embodiments, the dTALEN as referred to herein targets/binds or is capable of targeting/binding to a DMPK intron. In other embodiments, the dTALEN as referred to herein targets/binds or is capable of targeting/binding to a DMPK exon/intron boundary. In other embodiments, the dTALEN as referred to herein targets/binds or is capable of targeting/binding to a DMPK exon encompassing the 5'UTR. In other embodiments, the dTALEN as referred to herein targets/binds or is capable of targeting/binding to a DMPK exon encompassing the 3'UTR. In other embodiments, the dTALEN as referred to herein targets/binds or is capable of targeting/binding to the DMPK CTG repeat.

The skilled person will understand that sequence identity between two sequences is determined based on the aligned portions of the sequences.

In a preferred embodiment, the vector as described herein is capable of effecting expression of the polynucleic acid as defined herein, such as the CRISPR as defined herein, or the sequence as set forth in any of SEQ ID NOs: 43, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51 , 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 75, 76, 83, 84, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 1 10, 1 1 1 , 1 12, 1 13, 1 14, 1 15, 1 16, 1 17, 1 18 or a sequence having at least 80%, preferably at least 85%, more preferably at least 90%, even more preferably at least 95% sequence identity with a sequence as set forth in any of SEQ ID NOs: 43, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51 , 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58-62, 75, 76, 83, 84 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 1 10, 1 1 1 , 1 12, 1 13, 1 14, 1 15, 1 16, 1 17 or 1 18. To this end, the polynucleic acid sequences as defined herein generally are operably linked to regulatory sequences which permit transcription of said sequence. The binding to the genomic DNA is determined by the target sequence in the guide RNA sequence. Herein the length of the target sequence that is used is typically about 20 to 23 nucleotides. Indeed, there is the tendency to use long sequences to assure that a unique sequence in the genome is targeted. However, if a mismatch occurs, the longer the sequence the more chance that the mismatch is tolerated and the wrong target sequence is cut. Thus contrary to common practice, embodiments of guide RNA sequences have a target sequence of 21 , 20, 19, 18 or even 17 nucleotides. This shorter length prevents non-specific binding and subsequent erroneous cleavage. In certain embodiments, more than one dTALEN as referred to herein may be used to target the DMPK locus, e.g. a dTALEN targeting a sequence preceding the DMPK CTG repeats and another dTALEN targeting a sequence after the DMPK CTG repeats, be it either in vitro (e.g. in one of the cell types as described herein elsewhere) or in vivo (i.e. by introduction of the designer nuclease components, optionally together with a homology molecule, as described herein elsewhere).. In certain embodiments, more than one CRISPR as referred to herein may be used to target the DMPK locus, be it either in vitro (e.g. in one of the cell types as described herein elsewhere) or in vivo (i.e. by introduction of the designer nuclease components, optionally together with a homology molecule, as described herein elsewhere).

The term "operably linked" as used herein refers to the arrangement of various nucleic acid molecule elements relative to each such that the elements are functionally connected and are able to interact with each other. Such elements may include, without limitation, a promoter, an enhancer and/or a regulatory element, a polyadenylation sequence, one or more introns and/or exons, and a coding sequence of a gene of interest to be expressed (e.g. the dTALEN or CRISPR sequence). The nucleic acid sequence elements, when properly oriented or operably linked, act together to modulate the activity of one another, and ultimately may affect the level of expression of the transgene. By modulate is meant increasing, decreasing, or maintaining the level of activity of a particular element. The position of each element relative to other elements may be expressed in terms of the 5' terminus and the 3' terminus of each element, and the distance between any particular elements may be referenced by the number of intervening nucleotides, or base pairs, between the elements. The term "vector" as used herein refers to nucleic acid molecules, usually double- stranded DNA, which may have inserted into it another nucleic acid molecule, such as a dTALEN or CRISPR sequence. The vector is used to transport the insert nucleic acid molecule into a suitable host cell. A vector may contain the necessary elements that permit transcribing the insert nucleic acid molecule, and, optionally, translating the transcript into a polypeptide. Once in the host cell, the vector may for instance replicate independently of, or coincidental with, the host chromosomal DNA, and several copies of the vector and its inserted nucleic acid molecule may be generated. The term "vector" may thus also be defined as a gene delivery vehicle that facilitates gene transfer into a target cell. This definition includes both non-viral and viral vectors. Non-viral vectors include but are not limited to cationic lipids, liposomes, nanoparticles, PEG, PEI, etc. Viral vectors are derived from viruses including but not limited to: retrovirus, lentivirus, adeno- associated virus, adenovirus, herpesvirus, hepatitis virus or the like. Typically, but not necessarily, viral vectors are replication-deficient as they have lost the ability to propagate in a given cell since viral genes essential for replication have been eliminated from the viral vector. Preferred vectors are derived from lentivirus, adeno-associated virus, adenovirus, retroviruses and Antiviruses. Alternatively, gene delivery systems can be used to combine viral and non-viral components, such as nanoparticles or virosomes (Yamada et al. (2003) Nat Biotechnol. 21 , 885-890). Retroviruses and Antiviruses are RNA viruses that have the ability to insert their genes into host cell chromosomes after infection. Retroviral and lentiviral vectors have been developed that lack the genes encoding viral proteins, but retain the ability to infect cells and insert their genes into the chromosomes of the target cell (Miller (1990) Mol Cell Biol. 10, 4239-4242; Naldini et al. (1996) Science 272, 263-267.; VandenDriessche et al., (1999) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 96, 10379-10384. The difference between a lentiviral and a classical Moloney-murine leukemia-virus (MLV) based retroviral vector is that lentiviral vectors can transduce both dividing and non-dividing cells whereas MLV-based retroviral vectors can only transduce dividing cells. Adenoviral vectors are designed to be administered directly to a living subject. Unlike retroviral vectors, most of the adenoviral vector genomes do not integrate into the chromosome of the host cell. Instead, genes introduced into cells using adenoviral vectors are maintained in the nucleus as an extrachromosomal element (episome) that persists for an extended period of time. Adenoviral vectors will transduce dividing and nondividing cells in many different tissues (Chuah et al. (2003) Blood. 101 , 1734-1743). Another viral vector is derived from the herpes simplex virus, a large, double-stranded DNA virus. Recombinant forms of the vaccinia virus, another dsDNA virus, can accommodate large inserts and are generated by homologous recombination. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a small ssDNA virus which infects humans and some other primate species, not known to cause disease and consequently causing only a very mild immune response. AAV can infect both dividing and non-dividing cells and may incorporate its genome into that of the host cell. These features make AAV a very attractive candidate for creating viral vectors for gene therapy, although the cloning capacity of the vector is relatively limited. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the vector used is therefore derived from adeno associated virus. As indicated herein elsewhere, a reduction or elimination of the expression of the expanded repeat RNA (CUGexp) of the DMPK gene is effected by introducing in said cells a designer nuclease specifically targeting the DMPK gene. If the designer nuclease is a dTALEN nuclease, such may for instance be comprised in a vector, as defined herein elsewhere. In case of multiple dTALENs (such as two dTALENs, each comprising a left and a right TALE), both may be present on the same vector or different vectors, and may be introduced in the cells by any means known in the art, such as those defined herein elsewhere, such as by transfection or transduction. If the designer nuclease is a CRISPR/Cas nuclease, typically both the CRISPR, which may be one or more CRISPR, and the Cas will be introduced in the cell. Both the CRISPR and the Cas may for instance be comprised in a vector, as defined herein elsewhere. Both CRISPR and Cas may be present on the same vector or different vectors, and may be introduced in the cells by any means known in the art, such as those defined herein elsewhere, such as by transfection or transduction. As used herein, the term "transfection" refers to the introduction of a foreign material like exogenous nucleic acids, typically DNA, into eukaryotic cells by any means of transfer. Different methods of transfection are known in the art and include, but are not limited to, calcium phosphate transfection, electroporation, lipofectamine transfection, DEAE-Dextran transfection, microinjection or virally mediated transfection, i.e. transduction. As has already been described herein elsewhere, designer nucleases as referred to herein generate double strand breaks in DNA, such as genomic DNA. As is known in the art, generation of double strand breaks typically triggers DNA repair in cells. As a consequence, the cleaved strand is ligated, typically by non-homologous end joining. This process typically or often results in alteration of the repaired DNA strand, compared to the native strand (i.e. the strand prior to cleavage). Deletion or insertion of nucleotides may lead to frame shift mutations, which may result in a defective gene. If however, besides the designer nuclease also a polynucleic acid sequence is concomitantly introduced, wherein said polynucleic acid sequence is (at least partially) homologous to and bridges the DNA cleavage region, then alternatively to nonhomologous end joining of the cleaved DNA, homology-directed DNA repair may take place. This provides a mechanism to delete or replace specifically targeted sequences or reduce or eliminate expression of such sequences (e.g. by introduction of a premature polyadenylation signal). Accordingly, in certain embodiment, the reduction or elimination of the number of CTG repeats located in the 3'-UTR region of the DMPK gene or the reduction or elimination of the expression of the DMPK gene or the portion of the DMPK gene comprising the CGT repeat region, is effected by homology-directed repair. By means of example, and without limitation, one or more dTALEN, preferably a combination of left and right TALE, targeting the DMPK CTG repeat may be introduced into a cell as described herein elsewhere, such as the iPS or its progeny, such as the myogenic or neurogenic precursors as defined herein. By means of another example, and without limitation, one or more CRISPR targeting the DMPK CTG repeat may be introduced into a cell as described, together with a Cas In preferred embodiments, in addition to the one or more Talen or in addition to the one or more CRISPR and Cas a polynucleic acid sequence is introduced (i.e. a "donor molecule" or "homology sequence" or "donor sequence" or "homology molecule") having respectively a 5' and 3' homology sequence flanking the target site, and wherein preferably the number of CTG repeats is reduced, or wherein expression of the CTG repeat region is reduced or eliminated, or whereby the number or expression of the GTG repeats is reduced or eliminated after homology-directed repair. Preferably, the homology sequence contains less than 50 DMPK CTG repeats, more preferably, the homology sequence contains less than 35 DMPK CTG repeats. In this way cells originally having more than 35, such as more than 50 DMPK CTG repeats may be corrected by homology-directed repair, such that less than 50, preferably less than 35 DMPK CTG repeats remain. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the reduction or elimination in the cells according to the invention of the number of CTG repeats located in the 3'-UTR region of the DMPK gene to below 50, preferably to below 35 is effected by homology-directed repair, preferably by introducing in said cells a polynucleic acid sequence comprising less than 50, preferably less than 35 CTG repeats. Alternatively, homology-directed repair may be effected by introducing in said cells a polynucleic acid sequence having respectively a 5' and 3' homology sequence flanking the target site, and wherein preferably a selectable marker is present inbetween, such as for instance, without limitation, a puromycin expression cassette (i.e. a puromycin under control of a promoter, preferably wherein said promoter is different from the endogenous DMPK promoter, and preferably wherein said promoter is a constitutive promoter or an inducible promoter, which may or may not be tissue-specific). It will be understood that the homology sequence as defined herein may be double stranded or single stranded. In certain preferred embodiments, the donor molecule or homology sequence has a sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 40 or 60 or a variant sequence having at least 70%, preferably at least 80%, more preferably at least 90%, even more preferably at least 95% sequence identity with a sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 40 or 60. It is to be understood that such variant sequence should still be capable of homology- directed repair. The use of donor molecules in CRIPSR/Cas and TALEN technology has been described. Typically the donor comprises a transgene to knock-in a gene at the nuclease-targeted site. In other applications the donor comprises a selectable marker (e.g. antibiotic resistance gene, fluorescent protein) to verify that recombination of the donor molecule at the nuclease-targeted site has occurred and/or to enrich for gene corrected cells (e.g. by antibiotic selection or fluorescence activated cell sorting). In the context of the present invention the use of a donor sequence was believed to be of little benefit for the aimed medical application. The targeted endonuclease activity as envisaged for the purpose of reducing the CTG repeats in the DMPK gene, results in a break in the genome 5' and 3' of the expanded CTG repeat. In the absence of the donor the double stranded DNA is repaired by nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), wherein the 5' strand of the break is degraded by nucleases to create long 3' single-stranded tails followed by a ligation process. Since this process occurs 3' of the coding region (i.e. in the non-coding untranslated region), this repair method has little impact on the function of the gene in the excised and repaired gene. Targeting of the promotor region with NHEJ repair results mainly in insertions or deletions in the gene and premature transcription such that full length RNA comprising the extended CUG repeat is not produced, and accumulation of RNA in nucleofoci does not occur. In the context of the present invention, it is of importance that the generation of RNA with CUG repeats is inhibited, either by excision of the repeat, either by disruption of the gene. It is thus expected that the efficiency is determined by the efficacy of the nuclease system. Thus despite the fact that donor molecules are used for insertion (e.g. selectable marker genes) or replacement of genes, the use of donor molecules in knock-out experiments was considered not to influence the efficiency of excising the CTG repeats. In the methods of the present invention wherein the excision of the CTG repeat of the DMPK gene is accompanied by the provision of donor molecules allowing also DNA repair by homologous recombination with the genome flanking the CTG resulted in an unexpected improvement in the reduction of CTG compared to the system relying on NHEJ repair only. Specific types of donor molecule have, not protein encoding cassette no CTG repeats or at most 5, 10, 20, 25 or 50 CTG repeats, such that at most the number of CTG as occurring in a healthy subject are obtained. To our knowledge, the use of an essentially "empty" donor cassette in combination with a targeted nuclease procedure provides unexpected and surprising advantages. Donor sequences can also be differentiated base on the following criterion -The donor sequence comprises in the homologous regions 3' and/or 5' of the target site in the the sequence of the genome which will be cut by the nuclease, as a consequence both target genomic DNA and donor DNA will be cut by the nuclease. -The regions of homology are 5' and 3' of the target site in the genomic DNA, the donor will not contain the sequence of the genomic DNA that is cut by the site specific nuclease.

Particularly preferred delivery vehicles include adeno associated vectors (AAV), as described herein elsewhere. Gene therapy protocols, intended to achieve therapeutic gene product expression in target cells, in vitro, but also particularly in vivo, have been extensively described in the art. These include, but are not limited to, intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA (naked or in liposomes), interstitial injection, instillation in airways, application to endothelium, intra-hepatic parenchyme, and intravenous or intra-arterial administration (e.g. intra- hepatic artery, intra-hepatic vein). Various devices have been developed for enhancing the availability of DNA to the target cell. A simple approach is to contact the target cell physically with catheters or implantable materials containing DNA. Another approach is to utilize needle-free, jet injection devices which project a column of liquid directly into the target tissue under high pressure. These delivery paradigms can also be used to deliver viral vectors. Another approach to targeted gene delivery is the use of molecular conjugates, which consist of protein or synthetic ligands to which a nucleic acid-or DNA- binding agent has been attached for the specific targeting of nucleic acids to cells (Cristiano et al. (1993) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90, 1 1548-1 1552.).

Beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, alleviation of symptoms, diminishment of extent of disease, stabilized (i.e., not worsening) state of disease, delay or slowing of disease progression, amelioration or palliation of the disease state, and remission (whether partial or total), whether detectable or undetectable. "Treatment" can also mean prolonging survival as compared to expected survival if not receiving treatment. As such, "treating" may also encompass amelioration or alleviation of the disease. As used herein, a phrase such as "a subject in need of treatment" includes subjects, such as mammalian subjects, that would benefit from treatment of a given condition, such as, DM1 . Such subjects will typically include, without limitation, those that have been diagnosed with the condition, those prone to have or develop the said condition and/or those in whom the condition is to be prevented. The term "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount of a sequence or pharmaceutical composition of the invention effective to treat a disease or disorder in a subject, i.e., to obtain a desired local or systemic effect and performance. The term thus refers to the quantity of compound or pharmaceutical composition that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue, system, animal, or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the DM1 being treated. In particular, these terms refer to the quantity of sequence or pharmaceutical composition according to the invention which is necessary to prevent, cure, ameliorate, or at least minimize the clinical impairment, symptoms, or complications associated with DM1 . in either a single or multiple dose.

For instance, said cells and cell populations may be injected into muscle tissue surgically, by infusion into coronary arteries or delivered with a catheter or they may be injected intravenously. The tools and methods are intended for use in human therapies. In addition they are also applicable on animal disease models, known in the art. DM300/SXL mice have an insertion of 45 kb of the DM1 locus, and express the uman DMPK gene with 300 CTG repeats [Seznec (2001 ) Hum Mol Genet. 10, 2717-2726]. Because of intergenerational instability, the length of the CTG has jumped to more than 1500 repeats in DMSXL mice [Gomes-Pereira M, et al (2007). PLoS Genet. 3, e52]. The expression of mutant DMPK transcripts under the control of the human DMPK promoter is almost ubiquitous and shows pattern similar to that of murine Dmpk transcripts. The human DMPK transgene is expressed at lower levels in skeletal muscle and at higher levels in brain compared with murine Dmpk transcripts and leads to DM1 -associated phenotypes, including high mortality, growth retardation, muscle defects, and cognitive impairments This humanised DM300/SXL mice model contains the human DMPK gene with 300 CTG repeats, such that the tools designed for human applications can be used as such on this model . All other DM mice model know at present are not generated with human DMPK gene. Mouse specific tools may have to be developed to excise CTG repeats in the genome of these mouse models. Examples thereof include the HSA long repeat (HSA-LR) mice, which express 220 CTG repeats in the 3' UTR of the human skeletal alpha actin (HSA) gene and the inducible and tissue-specific transgenic EpA960 mice express large interrupted CTG repeats within the DMPK 3' UTR. It will be understood that the methods or uses disclosed herein can achieve cell populations comprising or enriched for iPS or the progeny thereof, such as myogenic or neurogenic precursor cells derived therefrom, such as myoblast-like cells or mesoangioblast-like cells, or neuronal/neurogenic cells as described herein elsewhere. For example, a cell population obtained or obtainable according to the methods disclosed herein may comprise at least 40 %, preferably at least 50 %, more preferably at least 60%, 70%, 80% or more of said cells. As can be appreciated, the cells as described herein may be further enriched or isolated from cell populations obtained or obtainable according to the methods disclosed herein on the basis of their distinctive characteristics (such as, for example, their marker expression and/or other phenotypic properties taught herein) using methods generally known in the art (e.g., FACS, clonal culture, panning, immunomagnetic cell separation, etc.), thereby yielding isolated cells which are enriched or substantially pure (e.g. at least 85% pure, preferably at least 90% pure, more preferably at least 95% pure or even 99% pure). In a further aspect, the present invention relates to the use of the cells as described herein, preferably the iPS cells derived from myoblasts or neuronal cells originating from a subject having DM1 as described herein, or the progeny thereof, such as myogenic or neurogenic precursor cells derived therefrom as described herein, optionally in which cells the expression of an expanded repeat RNA (CUGexp) of the dystrophy myotonic-protein kinase (DMPK) gene is reduced or eliminated as an in vitro model for studying DM1 or for drug-screening for identifying therapeutic molecules capable of treating and/or ameliorating DM1 . Accordingly, also provided herein are cell- based screening assays, particularly in vitro screening assays, such as, e.g., in assays of biological effects of candidate pharmacological substances and compositions; assays of toxicity of chemical or biological agents; and the like. Cell-based in vitro screening assays can be carried out as generally known in the art. For example, cells grown in a suitable assay format (e.g., in multi-well plates or on coverslips, etc.) are contacted with a candidate agent (e.g., a potential pharmacological agent) and the effect of said agent on one or more relevant readout parameters is determined and compared to a control. Relevant readout parameters may greatly vary depending on the type of assay and may include, without limitation, survival, occurrence of apoptosis or necrosis, altered morphology, altered responsiveness to external signals or metabolites, gene expression, etc. As indicated herein elsewhere, the iPS derived from myoblasts or neuronal cells originating from a subject having DM1 as defined herein, as well as the progeny thereof, such as myogenic or neurogenic precursor cells derived therefrom, such as the myopblast-like or mesoangioblast-like cells or neuron-like cells, display a DM1 specific phenotype, in particular nuclear foci, characteristic of accumulated toxic DMPK RNA. Evaluation of such nuclear foci provides a means for studying the disease as well as provides a tool for drug-screening. Accordingly, in an aspect, the invention relates to a method for identifying therapeutic molecules capable of treating and/or ameliorating DM1 , comprising contacting a candidate molecule with the cells as described herein, preferably the iPS cells derived from myoblasts or neuronal cells originating from a subject having DM1 as described herein, or the myogenic or neurogenic precursor cells derived therefrom as described herein. A reduction in the amount, size, or intensity of the nuclear foci is indicative of the candidate molecule being therapeutically effective. The staining and determination of nuclear foci in iPS and progenitors or precursors thereof provides the evidence that a targeted nuclease methods have an effect on the reduction of CTG repeats in the genome, reduction of CUG repeats in the RNA and reduction of ribonuclear inclusions in the nuclei. As an initial screening tool, candidate guide RNA's can be tested for their efficacy in IPS cells from DM1 patients, or other viable cells which can be transfected or transduced. The excision of CTG repeats at the genomic level can be measured by PCR techniques or Southern blot analysis. The reduction of CUG repeats in RNA can be determined by RT-PCR. This screening method provides an efficient system for high throughput screening of candidate constructs, and can be followed by a confirmation by iPS nuclear foci staining. It is to be understood that although particular embodiments, specific constructions and configurations, as well as materials, have been discussed herein for methods and applications according to the present invention, various changes or modifications in form and detail may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of this invention. The aspects and embodiments of the invention are further supported by the following non-limiting examples. EXAMPLES Example 1 : Generation of iPS cells from DM1 patient cells Human iPS cells were derived from myoblast cells from DM1 patients with extensive CTG repeats and from fibroblast of normal donors. For patient details see Table 2. The DM1 iPS cells were generated from skeletal myoblasts obtained from a 46 year old female suffering from DM1 with clinical manifestation of ptosis, slight atrophy, weakness of distal muscle, neckflexors and facial muscles; myotonia; cataract; ECG conduction abnormalities and daytime somnolence. This patient was selected because of the presence of expanded 1250 CTG repeats and because she manifested a severe DM1 phenotype. From a population of DM1 iPS colonies generated from this patient, three distinct iPS clones were selected and isolated for further expansion for subsequent characterizations experiments and for extensive characterization of the DM1 phenotype in differentiated and non-differentiated iPS cells. These expanded clones were designated as L22, L23 & L81 , as shown in Figure 1 . Clones were successfully grown in the presence and absence of mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF). Table 2: Details of iPS cells generated from DM1 patient cells according to an embodiment of the present invention The method for generating iPS from the DM1 patient myoblast or from normal donor using fibroblast cells was performed using retroviral vectors to deliver the 4 reprogramming factors Oct 4, Sox 2, klf4 and cMyc (OSKM) into these cells. The protocol for generation of human induced pluripotent stem cells is detailed below. 1 . Thawing and passage of cells 1 . The primary human cells used for iPS generation are preferably below passage 7-8. 2. The frozen vials of human cells were thawed at room temperature. 3 The freezing medium containing primary human cells were gently mixed to 8 ml pre- warmed E8 media in a 15 ml tube. 4. This mixture was then centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 3 mins. After centrifugation, the media was aspirated out and cell pellet was resuspended in medium and plated in required culture dish and incubated at 37 °C, 5% C02, 95% humidity. 5. After 24 hours, media change was given with fresh media and kept in culture until confluency is attained. 6. One day prior to transduction, the human cells were Trypsinize and plated for transduction. 7. For trypsinization, the medium was aspirated and washed with DPBS. Add 0.05% Trypsin and incubated at dish at 37oC for 5 mins. 8. Neutralize trypsin by addition of medium, and transfer the cell suspension to a 15 ml conical tube. 9. Count the cells and plate them at 2 x 10Λ5 cells to per 60 mm dish. 2. Day 0: Retroviral transduction of human cells 10. On the day of transduction, 15 ml tube containing 3ml of pre warmed cells media with retroviral particles for the Oct 4, Sox 2, klf4 and cMyc (OSKM) transcription factors are prepared. 1 1 . The cells are checked under microscope before transduction. 12. Thereafter, the media is aspirated out and fresh media with the OSKM cocktail prepared in step 10 is gently pipetted on to the cells and incubated at 37°C, 5% C02, 95% humidity. 13. Next day the media is changed with fresh media and plated checked for dead cells due to transduction. If the cell dead is less than 5%, then its normal as expected. 14. The culture dish is observed every day until day 3-4. 3. Day 4: Passaging of transduced human cells 15. At around day 4, the cells look confluent and passaged (as mentioned previously in 4.1 ) into new 60mm culture dishes at a spilt ratio of 1 :3. 4. Day 5: Change to hES media 16. Next day after plating the transduced cells, the medium is replaced with hES media supplemented with VPA (Valproic acid). 17. Media change is provided at every alternative day depending upon the confluency. 18. From day 7-8, the plates are screened regularly for emergence of colony like clusters. 5. Day 10-12: Appearance of colony like morphology 19. At around day 1 1 , small colony like morphology starts appearing. Depending on to the sample variation, the time point for appearance of colonies may vary. 20. Thereafter the colonies are microscopically followed every day as they expand in size. 21 . Media is regularly changed everyday since the appearance of colony like morphology. 6. Day 15: Mechanical passaging of colonies 22. At around day 15 when the colonies are suitable to be mechanically passaged, they are manually cut using a sterile 21 /22 guage needle and transferred to a new feeder plate. 23. Importantly at this step, each colony is transferred to a single plate containing feeder cells (with small surface area like that of a Organ cell/ OC). At this stage each colony is referred to an individual clone and labeled as passaged 0. 24. From this step onwards, during mechanical passaging a small molecule called Thiazovivin TM is added to the hES media at a final concentration of 10uM. This small molecule helps in attachment and increases the survival of the passaged colonies. 25. Similarly 20-30 clones are mechanically picked up per cell line in subsequent days. 7. Regular initial Mechanical passaging of colonies 26. The clones picked up are maintained and passaged separately till passage 10 depending upon their rate of growth and morphology. 27. After passage 10, the clones are expanded and simultaneously frozen. 28. After this stage of expansion of clones, they are characterized for expression of intrinsic pluripotency genes, silencing of the exogenous OSKM factors etc. 29. After characterization of the individual clones, if they are characteristic of iPS cells, they are termed as established iPS cell clones. The medium for generation and maintainance of iPS on MEF contained: Knock out Serum (Life technologies), Knock out DMEM (Life technologies), Glutamine, NEAA, Penstrep, bFGF, beta mercaptoethanol On Feeder Free: Essential 8 medium with supplement from Life technology company culture on matrix called GELTREX from Life technology company Immunocytochemistry was performed as follows: I . Plate about 80-90% confluent 35 mm iPS plate in 6 wells of 24 well plate in feeder free conditions using Essential 8 iPS culture kit (Invitrogen). 2. Change media of the cells every day. After 2 to 3 days, the colonies will reach appropriate size to do immunocytochemistry. 3. Aspirate the media and wash the cells twice with PBS. 4. Fix the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS by incubating 20 min at room temperature (RT). 5. Aspirate 4% PFA in PBS and wash 3 times with PBS during 10 min each time. 6. Block the cells 30 min with Blocking buffer (0.1 g BSA + 100 microliter Normal Goat serum, 0.25% Triton-X in PBS). No Triton-X needs to be added for SSEA4 antigen because SSEA4 is a surface antigen. 7. Apply 4 drops (approximately 200 μΙ_) or sufficient volume to cover the cells of Image-iT™ FX signal enhancer (Invitrogen). Incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature in a humid environment. 8. Incubate primary antibody for 2 to 3 hours at RT or overnight at 4 °C; SSEA4 antibody (catalog#-414000, Invitrogen), 5 to 10 microgram per ml; OCT4 antibody (catalog#- 13998, Invitrogen), 1 :400 dilution. 9. Wash 3 times with PBS during 5 min each time. 10. Add secondary antibody in blocking buffer (1 to 10 microgram per ml). For mouse SSEA4, use Alexa Fluor 488 Goat antimouse SFX kit from molecular probes (#A31619). For Rabbit OCT4, use Alexa fluor 555 goat anti rabbit SFX kit (#A31630). I I . Wash 3 times with PBS. 12. Stain with 300nM 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution in PBS for 1 to 5 min. 13. Visualise under fluorescent microscope. Transfected cells were plated under specific growth condition and colonies with ES-like morphology were picked. The expression of iPS cell markers such as AlkPhos (AP), SSEA-3, SSEA-4, OCT4, and Tra-1 -60, was monitored by immunostaining as shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 demonstrates the successful generation of teratoma in immunodeficient mice using iPS cells from these DM1 clones. Teratoma formation assay is the gold standard for evaluating the pluripotency of DM1 -iPS clones. H&E staining present the three germ layers of the teratoma. To determine the differentiation ability of the human DM1 iPS cells in vitro, embryoid bodies were induced and expression of endodermal, mesodermal and ectodermal markers was confirmed by RT-PCR or Western blot analysis. To test pluripotency in vivo, DM1 iPS cells were transplanted ectopically into immunodeficient mice (SCID) and teratoma formation was monitored along with histological examination of markers specific for cell types belonging to the three distinct germ layers. The DM1 -iPS cells were injected into immuno-compromised mice (CB17-SCID mice) and the tumor formed was dissected after 8 to 12 weeks, once it reached to a size of about 1 to 1 .5 centimeter. The dissected tumor tissue was fixed in 4% formalin and embedded in paraffin. The sections of paraffin-embedded tumor tissue were done, followed by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The H&E stained sections were visualized under the microscope to detect the tissues for endodermal, mesodermal and ectodermal origin. The three DM1 -iPS clones (L22, L23 & L81 ) showed the presence of tissues derived from the three germ layers i.e. endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm in the teratoma and therefore confirming the pluripotency of the DM1 iPS clones. An array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was performed to rule out any gross chromosomal defects in the three DM1 -iPS clones. No gross chromosomal abnormalities such as large deletions, insertions or duplications were detected in the three DM1 -iPS clones (Figure 4). The three DM1 -iPS clones showed the presence of nuclear foci on staining with CAG probe (provided by Dr. D. Furling's lab); Figure 5. These nuclear foci are characteristic of DM1 and are associated with the presence of an expanded CTG repeats. The nuclear foci were clearly visible in DM1 myoblasts from which the three iPS clones were derived, as well as in three DM1 -iPS clones, but no nuclear foci were visible in the control iPS, which did not contain expanded CTG repeats. This represents a particularly relevant cellular phenotype of DM1 , that can be used as endpoint to assess different therapeutic approaches that are specifically designed to target the pathogenic DM1 RNA. Indeed, if the pathogenic DM1 RNA is inhibited, the phenotypic correction by determining the disappearance of nuclear foci in non-differentiated DM1 iPS cells can be assessed. Real time quantitative RT-PCR were performed to assessed the expression of several genes that had been reported to be differentially expressed in DM1 such as Ryr, hSK2, hSIX5, Iso A and Iso A B, SK3 and SK1 (Table 1 ). The control iPS cells were derived from healthy donors and are used as the baseline expression level for comparison. The current data showed a significant increased expression level of SK3 gene by 3 to 4 fold (Table 3 & Figure 6) in all the three DM1 clones when compared to the control iPS cells. It had been reported that increase in SK3 has a critical role in the increase in Ca2+- induced fragility in DM1 cells (Rhodes et al. (2006) Hum Mol Genet. 15, 3559-3568). Increase in SK3 level is also correlated with myotonia. SK3 expression in muscle was observed to be increased in DM1 , ALS as well as polymyositis. All these three diseases have in common the dysfunctioning of the muscle. Therefore SK3 expression seems to be critical for muscle function. Table 3 Example 2: Coaxed cardiomyogenic and myogenic differentiation of iPS from DM1 patient cells Coaxed myogenic differentiation was induced in human iPS cells derived from cells of normal (healthy) subjects or DM1 patients, making it possible to study the effects of the mutated DMPK gene on myocardial differentiation and functionality. The DM1 iPS clones were expanded and subsequently subjected to myogenic differentiation. For the myogenic differentiation, we follow a 5-step feeder-free differentiation procedure (Tedesco et al. (2012) Sci Transl Med 4,140ra89); see also Figure 7. The differentiation protocol was carried out using iPS cells cultured on inactivated feeder cells (inactivated MEF) as per the protocol published by Tedesco et al. (2012). We also used iPS cells cultured on feeder free condition to differentiate by the same protocol. For the clone DM1 L81 , DM1 L23 and Control iPS we generated HIDEMs derived from iPS cells cultured both under feeder free and feeder (inactivated MEF) conditions. In case of DM1 L22 clone we have generated from iPS cell, which were cultured on feeder cells. Figure 8 below shows the morphology of the HIDEMs generated in early passage between p1 -p5. The 5-step differentiation protocol is composed of a 4 stage differentiation protocol to derive HIDEMs from iPSCs and plus final step of HIDEMs differentiation to Mature muscle cells upon MyoD induction. All the 4 stages are of 1 week long and was under Hypoxic condition (3% 02). Firstly, the iPSCs are dissociated into single cell suspension with EDTA based dissociation medium [0.5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM b- mercaptoethanol, 3% FBS in phosphate- buffered saline (PBS) without Ca2+ and Mg2+] and replated on Matrigel matrix (BD Biosciences) at a density of 6 x 104 cells/cm2 in a-MEM (Gibco) containing antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin), 10% FBS, nucleotides, and 0.2% b-mercaptoethanol for 1 week at 37°C, 5% C02, and 3 to 3% 02. After one week of culture the cells were again dissociated as in step 1 with gentle scraping if required. The cells were replated on Matrigel coated surface at a density of 2.5 x 104 cells /cm2 in the medium condition as in stage one. In the third stage, the cells are trypsinized and replated on Matrigel at high density (80% confluency) with Mesangioblast (MAB) medium i.e., MegaCell medium (Sigma), containing antibiotics (penicillin/streptomycin), 5% FBS, L-Glutamine, and 0.2% b-mercaptoethanol. In the fourth stage, cells were trypsinized and plated on non Matrigel coated culture surface and cultured in MegaCell medium and passaged as an when confluent. From now on, the cells obtained are maintained like MAB cells. After 4th stage the cells are characterized for markers expression (CD 13, 31 , 44, 56, 49b, 45, 146, SSEA4, and AP) (BD Biosciences) by Flow cytometry (BD Biosciences); these cells are also check for Pluripotency markers (hOCT4, hNANOG, hSOX2) and human specific Laminin AC. In the final step of differentiation, these HIDEMs cells obtained were transduced with lentiviral MyoD-ER (MOI - 50) and induced with standard Tamoxifen (Sigma) to obtain robust myogenic differentiation. The media for maintenance of HIDEMs contained: Mega Cell medium from Sigma, FBS from Sigma, Glutamine, NEAA, Penstrep, bFGF, beta marcaptoethanol In the process of differentiation, iPS cells gave rise to an intermediate cellular phenotype reminiscent of mesoangioblasts. These human iPSC-derived mesoangioblast-like stem/progenitor cells (designated as HIDEMs) could in turn be induced to differentiate into myoblast-like and myocyte-like cells. The DM1 -HIDEMs exhibited a significant increase in expression of CD13, CD44, CD49b and CD146, consistent with a mesoangioblast-like phenotype (Figure 9). As a part of characterizing the derived HIDEMS, the purity of the HIDEMs cultures was screened. This was tested using a human nuclear specific Lamin AC marker staining which is absent in mouse cells. Analysis of pictures obtained after staining of HIDEMs with Lamin AC showed positive staining for HIDEMs and absence of any lamin AC negative cells (Figure 10). HIDEMs obtained from feeder free IPS cells, were taken as an internal control. This clearly indicates that there were no carryover MEF feeder cells during the process of differentiation. Moreover, the DM1 -HIDEMs also expressed alkaline phosphatase (Figure 1 1 ). Staining for AP was carried out on the 6 HIDEMs lines from Control, DM1 L81 and DM1 L23 iPS clones under both feeder and feeder free conditions. A qualitative analysis of the staining images showed the presence of AP stained cells in the HIDEMs population. Conversely, during the differentiation of iPS cells to HIDEMs, expression of pluripotency markers declined (i.e. hNANOG, hOCT4 and hSOX4) (Figure 12). In the final step of coaxed differentiation of HIDEMs, the HIDEMs were subjected to MyoD induction after lentiviral transduction. These terminally differentiated cells expressed myosin heavy chain (MyHC) (Figure 13). Example 3: Nuclear foci staining experiment on DM1 L81 iPS corrected with dTALEN In this experiment, iPS cells derived from DM1 patient were used and iPS cells derived from normal donor were used as control. In order to obtain genetic correction of the expanded CTG repeats in the patient cells, the dTALEN genome-editing tool was used. The dTALEN approach as a 'molecular scissors' in combination with a donor molecule was used to specifically target the DMPK gene. Two dTALENs were designed to bind at the appropriately spaced positions of the complementary DMPK strands in order for the Fok\ to generate a double-strand break in the DMPK gene. A donor molecule (or homology molecule) containing a puromycin expression cassette flanked by left and right homology arms was used for homologous recombination (Figure 14). The donor molecule incorporated a polyA tail, which prevents transcription of downstream sequences (i.e. the CTG repeats). The donor molecule is as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 7. The left homology arm is as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 8. The right homology arm is as set forth in SEQ ID NO: 9. One TALEN ("left TALEN 1755"; SEQ ID NO: 1 ) was designed to bind to nucleotide sequence TGGAAGACTGAGTGCCCG (SEQ ID NO: 5), and another TALEN ("right TALEN 1756"; SEQ ID NO: 3) was designed to bind to nucleotide sequence TGGCAGGCGGTGGGCGCG (SEQ ID NO: 6; which is on the complementary stand of the DMPK gene). The amino acid sequences of the left and right TALEN are set forth in SEQ ID NO: 2 and 4, respectively. The cloning strategy for designing left TALEN 1755 and right TALEN 1756 is elaborated below. Cloning strategy of A626DZ56GFP (A626. plasmid nr 41 : SEQ ID NO: 26) The Vector plasmid DR TAL 1756 was obtained from Keith Joung's lab and restricted with Agel/BamHI to obtain a 7827bp vector backbone fragment containing the TALEN 1756 along with the first part of Fokl domain. The Agel/BamHI digestion removes the last part of Fokl domain including its STOP codon. In order to get the insert plasmid, a subcloning step was done in between. For the subcloning we used another TALEN plasmid DR TAL 1746 procured from Keith Joung's lab, which was digested with Hindlll/Agel to remove the last part of Fokl domain including its STOP codon (FRAGMENT 1 ). Also high fidelity PCR amplification was performed with DR TAL 1746 as template, Forward Primer GGTGTGATCGTGGATACTAAAGC (Fokl region with Hindi 11 site; SEQ ID NO: 28) & Reverse Primer TGGGCCGGGATTCTCCTCCACGTCACCGCATGTTAGA AGACTTCCTCTGCCCTCTCCGCCGCCGGACCTAAAGTTTATCTCGCCGTTATTAAA T (Fokl region without STOP codon + newly added 2A sequence in the primer; SEQ ID NO: 29) (FRAGMENT 2). Parallelly another high fidelity PCR amplification was performed with PB-PGK-GFP as template, Forward Primer ATGCGGTGACGTGGAGGAGAATCCCGGCCCAATGCCCGCCATGAAGATCGAG (GFP region + 2A peptide part; SEQ ID NO: 30) and Reverse Primer CTCAATGGTGATGGTG ATGATGACCGGTTTAGGCGAAGGCGATGGGGGTC (GFP + STOP TALEN; SEQ ID NO: 31 ) (FRAGMENT 3)(Post gel elution of the amplicon, this fragment was further treated with Dpnl enzyme to remove any extra contaminating plasmid used in PCR). Due to the choice of primers, the three fragments (1 , 2, 3) had overlapping arms for Gibson assembly, hence they were ligated by Gibson Assembly Kit (Cat# E261 1 S, NEB). Therefore we obtained the 1746-2A-GFP plasmid that had a Fokl region without STOP codon followed by a 2A-GFP. The 1331 bp (Fokl without STOP codon + 2A-GFP) Insert fragment for the main cloning was obtained by digesting the above generated 1746-2A-GFP plasmid with Agel/BamHI. This was then ligated to the Agel/BamHI digested vector plasmid DR TAL 1756 (as explained above). The good clone was confirmed by sequencing using the following primers: Reverse primer near the end of Fokl domain - CTGACTTCCTCTAAGGTTAAT (SEQ ID NO: 32) Reverse primer downstream of GFP - GGCAACTAGAAGGCACAGTC (SEQ ID NO: 33) DR_TAL_1756 Plasmid nr 12 DR_TAL_1746 Plasmid nr 2 PB-PGK-GFP 1746-2A-GFP Plasmid nr 28 A626pZ56GFP Plasmid nr 41 Cloning strategy of A618DZ55BFP (A618. plasmid nr 33: SEQ ID NO: 27) The Vector plasmid DR TAL 1755 was obtained from Keith Joung's lab and restricted with Agel/BamHI to obtain a 7827bp vector backbone fragment containing the TALEN 1755 along with the first part of Fokl domain. The Agel/BamHI digestion removes the last part of Fokl domain including its STOP codon. In order to get the insert plasmid, a subcloning step was done in between. For the subcloning we used the plasmid 1746-2A-GFP (synthesis explained above). This plasmid was restricted with Agel/BamHI to obtain a 7827bp fragment having the plasmid backbone without the last portion of Fokl domain and 2A-GFP. Also an overlapping PCR was done with forward primer 1 CCGG CGGATTCCCGAGAGAA (with BamHI site; SEQ ID NO: 34). reverse primer 1 CAGCTCGCTCATTGGGCCGGGATT (SEQ ID NO: 35). template 1 1746-2A-GFP, forward primer 2 CCCGGCCCAATGAGCGAGCTGATT (SEQ ID NO: 36). reverse primer 2 CCCGACCGGTTAATTAAGCTTGTGCCC (SEQ ID NO: 37) and template 2 pCLS9026-CMV-BFP. The primers and template of set 1 amplify a region of Fokl domain + 2A peptide and those of set 2 amplify the BFP gene from its template. The reverse primer 1 and forward primer 2 are overlapping. Together the PCR produces a Fokl-2A-BFP fragment of 1364bp flanked by Agel & BamHI sites. This fragment was cloned in the Agel/BamHI restricted 1746-2A-GFP to get a new plasmid named A612pZ46-2A-BFP. The 1364 bp Insert fragment was restricted out of A612pZ46-2A-BFP (cloned in lab, explained above) was again digested with Agel/BamHI and ligated into the Agel/BamHI digested DR TAL 1755 plasmid to obtain the final product. The good clone was confirmed by sequencing using the primers with SEQ ID NO: 38 and 39. DR TAL 1755 Plasmid nr 1 1 1746-2A-GFP Plasmid nr 28 A612pZ46-2A-BFP Plasmid nr 26 pCLS9026-CMV-BFP A618pZ55BFP Plasmid nr 33 The cloning strategy for the donor molecule (SEQ ID NO: 40) which was used in this experiment (in combination with TALEN 1755 and TALEN 1756) is elaborated below. The donor molecule used for the TALEN system contained a Pgk-Puro cassette along with an SV40pA flanked by homology arms on either side. An SV40-PGK-PURO- 200bpDMPK fragment was synthesized & cloned by life tech in a company vector backbone. This fragment had the 200bp right homology arm along with the Pgk-Puro cassette with an in built pA and an SV40pA (once targeted onto the defective DMPK gene, it would stop the transcription of expanded CTG repeats). This vector plasmid (SV40-PGK-PURO-200bpDMPK) was linearized with Ncol digestion. For the insert fragment, the 2240bp left homology arm of the donor molecule was PCR amplified from the genomic DNA of L81 iPS using the forward primer GGCCTAGGCGCGCCATGAGCTCCGCCCTCGG TGTCCCCACAGGATGAAAC (SEQ ID NO: 41 ) and reverse primer GCAATAAACAAG TTGGGCCATGCCGTGCCCCGGGCACTCAGTCTTCCAAC (SEQ ID NO: 42). The PCR amplified product had overhangs similar to the Ncol digested SV40-PGK- PURO-200bpDMPK plasmid. Due to the presence of identical overhangs, Gibson assembly could ligate them. Gibson assembly was done using the Gibson assembly Master Mix (Cat # E261 1 S Bioke, NEB). The good clones were screened by digestion & confirmed by sequencing. SV40-PGK-PURO-DMPK200bp Plasmid nr 63 In silico sequence of talen 1755 and 1756 donor 13ACQPFCJ 417916_SV-40-PGK-PuroDMPK Plasmid nr 64 Additional approaches to target the DMPK locus include among others the deletion or replacement of the CTG repeats by using two flanking TALEN pairs to generate a genomic cut respectively 5' and 3' of the CTG repeat region (Figure 22), and which can be achieved by TALEN pairs recognizing target sequences at set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 10-1 1 (downstream left and right TALE target respectively) and SEQ ID NOs: 12-13 (upstream left and right TALE target respectively); or the disruption of a critical regulatory region (e.g. the SP1 or AP2 binding site in the DMPK promoter or the DMPK start codon) by using one TALEN pair, of which the cut site overlaps the critical region (Figure 23). The latter approach can be achieved for targeting the AP2 binding site with a TALE pair recognizing a sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 14-15 (left and right TALE target respectively), for targeting the start codon with a TALE pair recognizing a sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 16-17 (left and right TALE target respectively), or for targeting the SP1 binding site with a TALE pair recognizing a sequence as set forth in SEQ ID NOs: 18-19 (left and right TALE target respectively). These and additional target sites are also listed in Table 4. Table 4 Experimental Design In vitro correction in iPS (protocol I) and HIDEMs (protocol II): Protocol I: For the in-vitro correction, DM1 iPS, at passage 51 were used for nucleofection using P3 Primary Cell 4D nucleofected X kit (Lonza). Cells at passage 51 were harvested with TrypLE Express (Life technologies), and 2 x 106 cells were used per nucleofection reaction. The cells were resuspended in 20 μΙ of nucleofection mixture containing 16.4 μΙ of P3 Nucleofector solution, 3.6 μΙ of supplement and required DNA. Thereafter, the reaction mixtures were transferred into a well of Nucleocuvette strips and conducted nucleofection using CB-150 program. Post nucleofection cells were plated in single well of Geltrex (Life technologies) coated 6 well plate in Essential 8 (Life technologies) medium supplemented with ROCK inhibitor and incubated at 37 °C, 5% C02, overnight. Complete media change was provided next day post nucleofection. Protocol II: For the in-vitro correction, DM1 iPS derived HIDEMs cells, at passage 8 were used for nucleofection using P1 Primary Cell 4D nucleofected X kit (Lonza). Cells at passage 8 were harvested with 0.05% Trypsin EDTA (Life technologies), and 1 x 106 cells were used per nucleofection reaction. The cells were resuspended in 100 μΙ of nucleofection mixture containing 80 μΙ of P1 Nucleofector solution, 20 ml of supplement and required DNA. Thereafter, the reaction mixtures were transferred into a 100μΙ Nucleocuvette cuvette and conducted nucleofection using FF104 program. Cells were plated in single well of 6 well plate post nucleofection and incubated at 37 °C, 5% C02, 3% 02 overnight. Complete media change was provided next day post nucleofection. Table 5 Plasmid maps of the vectors comprising the donor molecule, left TALEN, and right TALEN are illustrated in Figure 15 A-B (donor molecule), C (left TALEN), and D (right TALEN), respectively. Post nucleofection follow up At 48 hours post nucleofection, the nucleofected cells were harvested for cell sorting using FACS Aria III (BD Biosciences). Before harvesting the cells for sorting, qualitative examination of the efficiency of transection was done by microscopic examination of GFP (green fluorescent protein) and BFP (blue fluorescent protein) expression. We sorted out the cells, by selecting the double positive (GFP+BFP+) cell population in our sample .Figure 16 shows a cell culture 4 days after sorting. Figure 17 shows a cell culture 14 days after sorting. The sorted cells were expanded and taken for experiments for analysis of c!TALEN mediated correction of the DM1 iPS cells by determining the nuclei foci. DM1 cells that do not contain any nuclei foci are corrected cells. After sorting of the cells, the GFP+BFP+ cells were expanded for 18 days until puromycin selection initiation. Figure 18 shows a cell culture after the indicated days of puromycin selection (conditions 1 A, 2A, and 3A are respectively the bottom, middle, and top row). It is clear that after 4 days of puromycin selection, the number of viable cells in condition 1 A is 40-50%, whereas the number of viable cells in control conditions 2A and 3A is 0%. This indicates that homologous recombination between the donor molecule and the targeted region had occurred and the donor molecule containing the puro cassette and the poly A tail had been inserted in the genome of the TALEN targeted cells. Nuclear Foci staining of dTALEN nucleofected and sorted L22 iPS cells For the Nuclear Foci staining, iPS cells were plated at 40, 000 cells per 2.4 cm sq (per chamber) of 4-chambered slide (Lab-Tek® II). Next day the cells were used for Nuclear Foci staining. Materials and Methods For detecting CUGexpRNA Foci (Nuclear Foci), the cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 mins and washed 3 times with 70% ethanol (Sigma Aldrich). Following that two 10 mins wash was given with a solution of PBS and 5mM MgCI2. The cells were then incubated with PNA -5'Cy3 (CAG)5 3' (Eurogentec) in Hybridization buffer [2x SSC Buffer (Life technologies), 50% Formamide and 0.2% BSA(Sigma Aldrich)] for 90 mins at 37 0 C. Post hybridization, the cells were washed with PBS (Life technologies)+ 0.1 % Tween (Sigma Aldrich) for 5 mins. Furthermore it was washed in preheated PBS+ 0.1 % Tween for 30 mins at 45 0 C. Finally the cells were stained with DAPI nuclear stain (1 :500, 5 mins) after a PBS wash. Prior to microscopy the cells were again washed with PBS. Results Absence of Nuclear foci (CUGexpRNA Foci) in dTALEN corrected iPS cells Post CUGexpRNA Foci (Nuclear Foci) staining, microscopic images of the stained nuclei were analyzed per transfection condition. We focused on the number of nuclei with or without Foci. Figures 19 and 20 respectively show the foci nuclear ratio and the amount of nuclear foci for the respective conditions. The foci nuclear ratio is determined as the ratio of the total number of ribonuclear foci counted and the total number of nuclei counted. It is clear that the number of foci in condition 1 A is less than the control conditions. It was observed that about 30% of the nuclei in the TALEN targeted condition (1 A) did not contain RNA foci as compared to control groups where all the nuclei contained RNA foci. This provides evidence for successful incorporation of the puromycin cassette and the polyA STOP before the CTG repeats and subsequent loss of RNA foci in TALEN corrected cells. Example 4: Nuclei foci staining experiment on DM1 L81 iPS-Mab corrected with CRISPR/Cas9 System (ssOligo) In this experiment, iPS cells derived from DM1 patient were used to obtain a differentiated population of committed muscle precursors cells called HIDEMs. In order to obtain genetic correction of the expanded CTG repeats in the patient cells, the CRISPR/Cas genome-editing tool was used. The RNA-based CRISPR/Cas9 designer nuclease approach as a 'molecular scissors' in combination with single-stranded targeting oligo (ssOligo) to specifically excise the expanded CTG repeats of the DMPK gene. Two guide RNAs were designed to cut specifically at the 5' and 3' end of the CTG repeats of the DM1 patient iPS-derived HIDEMs. A single stranded oligo designed to contain 5x CTG repeat were used for homologous recombination after the removal of the expanded CTG repeats (Figure 24). Experimental Design The cloning strategy for the Cas9 expression plasmid (SEQ ID NO: 59) as used in this experiment is elaborated below. The vector plasmid, hCas9 (Cat # 41815, addgene), was purchased from addgene and cut open with Rsrll/Xmajl digestion to obtain an 8827bp vector fragment, which included the complete Cas9 gene. The 1647bp insert fragment, containing CMV-BFP cassette was PCR amplified by forward primer CCCTCCTAGGCCGCCATGCATTAG (with Xmajl site; SEQ ID NO: 63) and reverse primer CCCGTTCGGTCCGCGCCTTAAGATACATTG (with Rsrll site; SEQ ID NO: 64), using the pCLS9026-CMV-BFP as template. The insert fragment was then digested with Rsrll/Xmajl and ligated to the vector fragment. The good clones were confirmed by sequencing for various portions on incorporated BFP gene with the following primers: Forward Primer upstream pCMV - CCTCTGCCTCTGAGCTATT (SEQ ID NO: 65) Reverse Primer in SV40pA of BFP - GATACCGTAAAGCACGAGGAA (SEQ ID NO: 66) Cas9 (41815) Plasmid nr 19 pCLS9026-CMV-BFP A637pBFP41815 Plasmid nr 45 The cloning strategy for the DM1 gRNA encoding plasmids as used in this experiment is elaborated below. Guide RNA 14189 (A639pGFP14189-2 plasmid nr 47 ; SEQ ID NO : 61 ) The first step was to create a plasmid (CR14189) having the U6 promoter and the left gRNA 14189-target sequence (specific for our approach). For this, the guide RNA backbone having the U6 promoter (Cat # 41824, addgene) was purchased from addgene and cut open with Aflll digestion to obtain a 3500bp fragment. Furthermore, the gRNA 14189 specific for the target site was synthesized by annealing two oligos, mentioned below (the underlined regions indicate identical overhangs in the annealed oligos product with the Aflll digested U6 containing backbone)- TTTCTTGGCTTTATATATCTTGTGGAAAGGACGAAACACCGTCGAAGGGTCCTTGT AGCC (Cr14189_lnsert_F; SEQ ID NO:75) GACTAGCCTTATTTTAACTTGCTATTTCTAGCTCTAAAACGGCTACAAGGACCCTT CGAC (Cr14189lnsertR; SEQ ID NO:76). Due to the presence of identical overhangs, Gibson assembly could ligate the U6 containing gRNA backbone and the annealed oligos. Gibson assembly was done using the Gibson assembly Master Mix (Cat # E261 1 S Bioke, NEB). The above created plasmid (CR14189) having the U6 promoter and the left gRNA 14189-target sequence was then used as the vector backbone and restricted by Dralll and Sfil to get a 3621 bp vector fragment. The 1630bp insert fragment, containing CMV-GFP cassette was PCR amplified by forward primer CCCTGGCCACCATGGCCGCCATGCATTAG (with Sfil site; SEQ ID NO: 77) and reverse primer CCCTCACGAAGTGCGCCTTAAGATACATTG (with Dralll site; SEQ ID NO:78), using the pCLS9025-CMV-GFP as template. The insert fragment was then digested with Dralll/Sfil and ligated to the vector fragment. The good clones were confirmed by sequencing for various portions with the following primers: Forward Primer in Kanamycin gene - GGACATAGCGTTGGCTACCC (SEQ ID NO:79) Reverse Primer downstream the GFP gene - GGTATCTGCGCTCTGCTGAA (SEQ ID NO:80) Forward Primer in CMV promoter - GTGTACGGTGGGAGGTCTAT (SEQ ID NO:81 ) Forward Primer in the backbone upstream of U6-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC (SEQ ID NO:82) CR41824 Plasmid nr 25 pCLS9025-CMV-GFP A639pGFP14189-2 Plasmid nr 47 Guide RNA 14254 (A640pGFP14354-2 plasmid nr 48 ; SEQ ID NO : 62) The first step was to create a plasmid (CR14254) having the U6 promoter and the right gRNA 14254-target sequence (specific for our approach). For this, the guide RNA backbone having the U6 promoter (Cat # 41824, addgene) was purchased from addgene and cut open with Aflll digestion to obtain a 3500bp fragment. Furthermore, the gRNA 14254 specific for the target site was synthesized by annealing two oligos, mentioned below (the underlined regions indicate identical overhangs in the annealed oligos product with the Aflll digested U6 containing backbone)- TTTCTTGGCTTTATATATCTTGTGGAAAGGACGAAACACCGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTG CTGC (Cr14254_lnsert_F; SEQ ID NO:83) GACTAGCCTTATTTTAACTTGCTATTTCTAGCTCTAAAACGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAG CAGC (Cr14254lnsertR; SEQ ID NO:84). Due to the presence of identical overhangs, Gibson assembly could ligate the U6 containing gRNA backbone and the annealed oligos. Gibson assembly was done using the Gibson assembly Master Mix (Cat # E261 1 S Bioke, NEB). The above created plasmid (CR14254) having the U6 promoter and the left gRNA 14254-target sequence was then used as the vector backbone and restricted by Dralll and Sfil to get a 3621 bp vector fragment. The 1630bp insert fragment, containing CMV-GFP cassette was PCR amplified by forward primer with SEQ ID NO:85 and reverse primer with SEQ ID NO:86, using the pCLS9025-CMV-GFP as template. The insert fragment was then digested with Dralll/Sfil and ligated to the vector fragment. The good clones were confirmed by sequencing for various portions with the primers with SEQ ID NO: 79 to 82 as mentioned before.

Cells at passage 51 were harvested with TrypLE Express (Life technologies), and 2 x 106 cells were used per nucleofection reaction. The cells were resuspended in 20 μΙ of nucleofection mixture containing 16.4 μΙ of P3 Nucleofector solution, 3.6 μΙ of supplement and required DNA. Thereafter, the reaction mixtures were transferred into a well of Nucleocuvette strips and conducted nucleofection using CB-150 program. Post nucleofection cells were plated in single well of Geltrex (Life technologies) coated 6 well plate in Essential 8 (Life technologies) medium supplemented with ROCK inhibitor and incubated at 37 °C, 5% C02, overnight. Complete media change was provided next day post nucleofection. Protocol II: For the in-vitro correction, DM1 iPS derived HIDEMs cells, at passage 8 were used for nucleofection using P1 Primary Cell 4D nucleofected X kit (Lonza). Cells at passage 8 were harvested with 0.05% Trypsin EDTA (Life technologies), and 1 x 106 cells were used per nucleofection reaction. The cells were resuspended in 100 μΙ of nucleofection mixture containing 80 μΙ of P1 Nucleofector solution, 20 ml of supplement and required DNA. Thereafter, the reaction mixtures were transferred into a 100μΙ Nucleocuvette cuvette and conducted nucleofection using FF104 program. Cells were plated in single well of 6 well plate post nucleofection and incubated at 37 °C, 5% C02, 3% 02 overnight. Complete media change was provided next day post nucleofection. Two different amounts of DNAs were used for the experiment; SET A: containing 3μg of Cas9 plasmid, 3μg of gRNA CR14189 plasmid, 3μg of gRNA CR14254 plasmid and 250pmoles of ssOligo. Whereas SET B contained double the amount of each respective plasmids with same amount of ssOligo. Control conditions without Cas9 plasmid but replaced by a CMV-BFP plasmid as control were used (as in Table 6). Table 6 Plasmid maps of the vectors comprising the ssOligo, Cas9-BFP, gRNA CR14189, and gRNA CR14254 are illustrated in Figure 25 A, B, C, and D, respectively. The nucleotide sequence of the ssOligo, Cas9, gRNA CR14189, and gRNA CR14254 corresponds to SEQ ID NOs: 43 to 46, respectively. In SEQ ID NO: 43, nucleotides 1 -60 correspond to the left homology arm, nucleotides 61 to 75 correspond to 5 CTG repeats, and nucleotides 76 to 140 correspond to the right homology arm. Nucleotides 83-84 ("AT") replace the corresponding nucleotides "CA" of the native DMPK gene (i.e. nucleotides 416-417of SEQ ID NO: 47) in order to generate an EcoRV restriction site. In SEQ ID NO: 45, nucleotides 1 -19 correspond to the gRNA target site, and nucleotides 20-96 correspond to the gRNA scaffold. In SEQ ID NO: 46, nucleotides 1 -20 correspond to the gRNA target site, and nucleotides 21 -97 correspond to the gRNA scaffold. SEQ ID NOs: 48 and 49, respectively correspond to SEQ ID NOs: 45 and 46, wherein the gRNA corresponding sequence is fused to the U6 promoter and a poly-T. SEQ ID NOs: 50 and 51 , respectively correspond to the target site of SEQ ID NOs: 45 and 46. Post Nucleofection follow up At 48 hours post nucleofection, the nucleofected cells were harvested for cell sorting using FACS Aria III (BD Biosciences). Before harvesting the cells for sorting, qualitative examination of the efficiency of transfection was done by microscopic examination of GFP (green fluorescent protein) and BFP (blue fluorescent protein) expression. We sorted out the cells, which contained Cas9 with one or both the gRNAs by selecting the double positive (GFP+BFP+) cell population in our sample. We could obtain 54%, 70%, 76% and 53% double positive (GFP+BFP+) cells for condition 1 A, 2A, 3B and 4B respectively (see also Table 7). The sorted cells were expanded and taken for experiments for analysis of CRISPR/Cas mediated correction of the DM1 HIDEMs cells by determining the nuclei foci. DM1 cells that do not contain any nuclei foci are corrected cells. Table 7 Nuclear Foci staining of CRISPR/Cas transfected and sorted HIDEMs cells For the Nuclear Foci staining, HIDEMs cells were plated at 40, 000 cells per 2.4 cm sq (per chamber) of 4-chambered slide (Lab-Tek® II). Next day the cells were used for Nuclear Foci staining. Materials and Methods For detecting CUGexpRNA Foci (Nuclear Foci), the cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 mins and washed 3 times with 70% ethanol (Sigma Aldrich). Following that two 10 mins wash was given with a solution of PBS and 5mM MgCI2. The cells were then incubated with PNA -5'Cy3 (CAG)5 3' (Eurogentec) in Hybridization buffer [2x SSC Buffer (Life technologies), 50% Formamide and 0.2% BSA(Sigma Aldrich)] for 90 mins at 37 0 C. Post hybridization, the cells were washed with PBS (Life technologies)+ 0.1 % Tween (Sigma Aldrich) for 5 mins. Furthermore it was washed in preheated PBS+ 0.1 % Tween for 30 mins at 45 0 C. Finally the cells were stained with DAPI nuclear stain (1 :500, 5 mins) after a PBS wash. Prior to microscopy the cells were again washed with PBS. Results Absence of Nuclear foci (CUGexpRNA Foci) in CRISPR/Cas corrected HIDEMs cells Post CUGexpRNA Foci (Nuclear Foci) staining, microscopic images of the stained nuclei were analyzed for an average of 240 nuclei per transfection condition. We focused on the number of nuclei with or without Foci. We could obtain 4 nuclei without any RNA foci in the CRISPR/Cas transfected conditions as compared to the control conditions, consistent in both sets with low and higher amount of DNA; Figure 26 (overview) and 27 (individual cells). In conclusion, the results show the first report demonstrating correction of DM1 patient iPS derived muscle precursors by CRISPR/Cas system. In both condition 1 & 3, where the HIDEMs cells has been transfected with Cas9 plasmid, there are presence of corrected cells demonstrated by Nuclear Foci free nucleus. The efficiency of correction is about 1 .7% and 1 .5% with 3ug and 6ug Cas9 respectively, calculated as follows: 4 Foci free nuclei divide by 235 total nuclei counted =1 .7 % & 4/273 = 1 .5 %. table 8 The 2nd,3 , 4th and 5th columns correspond to Condition 1 A, 2A, 3B and 4B of this experiment (Table 8 above). Example 5: Nuclei foci staining experiment on DM1 L81 iPS corrected with Crispr Cas System (donor molecule) A similar experiment as Example 3 was performed. The correction was done however on iPS cells, and instead of a ssOligo, a donor molecule was co-delivered with the Cas9 and gRNA constructs (see Figure 28). The donor molecule contained a puromycin selection marker flanked by left and right homology arms (see Figure 29). The nucleotide sequence of the Cas9, gRNA CR14189, and gRNA CR14254 corresponds to SEQ ID NOs: 44 to 46, respectively. SEQ ID NO: 52 corresponds to the nucleotide sequence of the donor molecule containing the puromycin expression cassette flanked by left and right homology arms. In SEQ ID NO: 52, nucleotides 1 - 1026 correspond to the left homology arm, nucleotides 1027 to 1 172 correspond to SV40 pA, nucleotides 1 173 to 1772 correspond to the puromycin, nucleotides to 1773 to 2368 correspond to the PGK promoter, and nucleotides 2369 to 3397 correspond to the right homology arm. In SEQ ID NO: 45, nucleotides 1 -19 correspond to the gRNA target site, and nucleotides 20-96 correspond to the gRNA scaffold. In SEQ ID NO: 46, nucleotides 1 -20 correspond to the gRNA target site, and nucleotides 21 -97 correspond to the gRNA scaffold. SEQ ID NOs: 48 and 49, respectively correspond to SEQ ID NOs: 45 and 46, wherein the gRNA corresponding sequence is fused to the U6 promoter and a poly-T. SEQ ID NOs: 50 and 51 , respectively correspond to the target site of SEQ ID NOs: 45 and 46. The cloning strategy for the donor molecule (SEQ ID NO: 60) as used in this experiment is elaborated below. The donor molecule used for the CRISPR/Cas system contained a Pgk-Puro cassette along with an SV40pA. The Pgk-Puro + SV40pA segment was taken from the SV40- PGK-PURO-DMPK200bp plasmid, which was synthesized and used for TALEN-Donor cloning (details in TALEN -donor cloning). This plasmid when digested with Kpnl/Sall, gave us a fragment of 4342bp which contained the Pgk-Puro + SV40pA segment. This Kpnl/Sall digestion actually removed the 200bp TALEN right homology arm from the whole plasmid. As we had the Pgk-Puro + SV40pA segment, our next step was to flank this segment with 1026bp CRISPR left homology arm and 1029bp CRISPR right homology arm. We first amplified the 1029bp CRISPR right homology arm as a part of 1039bp fragment from L81 DM1 iPS genomic DNA using the forward primer CCCGTCTGTCGACCTGCTGCTGGGGG (with Sail site; SEQ ID NO: 67) and reverse primer CCCTGGTACCGACTAAGGGCGCGAAG (with Kpnl site, SEQ ID NO:68). This fragment was digested (Kpnl/Sall) and cloned into the Kpnl/Sall digested Pgk-Puro + SV40pA segment containing backbone. The good clones were confirmed by sequencing using the following primers Primer 2 in PGK promoter - CTAAGCTTGGCTGGACGTA (SEQ ID NO:69) Primer 1 in 1039bp fragment - CCTATGGAAAAACGCCAGC (SEQ ID NO:70) This product was A837pPGK-PURO-SK, containing the Pgk-Puro + SV40 segment fused with 1029bp right homology arm which was an intermediate product used to clone our final donor molecule. The 1026bp CRISPR left homology arm was then amplified as a part of the 1035bp fragment from L81 DM1 iPS genomic DNA using the forward primer CCTTGGCGCGCCTCCCTGGCTCCT (with Ascl site; SEQ ID NO:71 ) and reverse primer CCCTGAGCTCCGGCTACAAGGAC (with Sacl site; (SEQ ID NO:72). The intermediate product A837pPGK-PURO-SK was then digested with Sacl/AscI to obtain a 5364bp fragment, which was then ligated to the Sacl/AscI digested 1035bp insert fragment. The good clones were confirmed by sequencing using the following primers: Forward primer upstream of 1026bp arm -GATGTGCTGCAAGGCGATTA (SEQ ID NO:73) Reverse primer after SV40A-CCACAACTAGAATGCAGTGAAA (SEQ ID NO:74) SV40-PGK-PURO-DMPK200bp Plasmid nr 63 A838pPGK-PURO-SKAS Plasmid nr 66 Two days after nucleofection (cf. Example 3), cells were sorted for BFP+ and GFP+ cells, which were expanded for 16 days before puromycin selection initiation. Table 9 indicates the transfection conditions as well as the amount and percentage of GFP+, BFP+, and GFP+/BFP+ cells obtained (condition 1 A is the experimental condition and condition 2A and 3A are control conditions).

This indicates successful incorporation of the puromycin cassette from the donor molecule in the genome, likely into the desired locus. This indicates that targeted excision of the CTG repeat had occurred. Example 6. Lenti CRISPR mediated targeting of the HIDEMs L81 HIDEM cells (see Example 1 ) were used for CRISPR/Cas9 mediated targeting. In order correct the expanded CTG repeats in these patient cells, CRISPR/Cas genome- editing was performed wherein the Cas9 and gRNA expression cassette were in a lentiviral backbone and were delivered into the HIDEM cells by lentiviral transduction. The donor molecule was delivered by Nucleofection. A set of guide RNAs was prepared targeting regions near the 5' end and the 3' end of the CTG repeat as well as guide RNAs targeting the promoter region of the DMPK gene (at the SP1 and AP2 transcription factor binding site and the ATG start codon). A set of plasmid vectors comprising a U6 promotor (underlined) different target sequences [target sequence] and the scaffold part of the CRISPR sequence were provided AGGCTTTAAA GGAACCAATT CAGTCGACTG GATCCGGTAC CAAGGTCGGG CAGGAAGAGG GCCTATTTCC CATGATTCCT TCATATTTGC ATATACGATA CAAGGCTGTT AGAGAGATAA TTAGAATTAA TTTGACTGTA AACACAAAGA TATTAGTACA AAATACGTGA CGTAGAAAGT AATAATTTCT TGGGTAGTTT GCAGTTTTAA AATTATGTTT TAAAATGGAC TATCATATGC TTACCGTAAC TTGAAAGTAT TTCGATTTCT TGGCTTTATA TATCTTGTGG AAAGGACGAA ACACC [ target s equence l GTTTTAGAGC TAGAAATAGC AAGTTAAAAT AAGGCTAGTC CGTTATCAAC TTGAAAAAGT GGCACCGAGT CGGTGCTTTT TTTAAGCTTG GGCCGCTCGA GGTACCTCTC TACATATGAC ATGTGAGCAA AAGGCCAGCA AAAGGCCAGG AACCGTAAAA AGGCCGCGTT GCTGGCGT The sequences 5' and 3' of the target sequence are depicted by SEQ ID NO: 87 and SEQ ID NO: 88 The different target sequences which are cloned in the vector are shown in the table 10 below.

Thereafter, we transferred the reaction mixtures into a 100μΙ nucieofection cuvette and conducted nucieofection using FF104 program. Cells were divided into 3 single wells of 6 well plate post nucieofection and incubated at 37 0 C, 5% C02, 3% 025-6 hrs (Table 1 1 ). Table 1 1 : Details of the nucieofection conditions.
