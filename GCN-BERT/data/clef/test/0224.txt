Third Step: Synthesis of Compound A6
8.7 g of compound A6 (in the scheme referred as [3]) was obtained in 68% yield by using the intermediate I-6 (10 g, 15.2 mmol) and 2-(3-bromophenyl)-4,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-triazine (7.9 g, 18.32 mmol). These reagents were dissolved in 250 mL tetrahydrofuran under a nitrogen environment, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0.9 g, 0.75 mmol) was added thereto, and the mixture was stirred. Then, potassium carbonate saturated in water (5.2 g, 37 mmol) was added thereto, and the mixture was heated and refluxed at 80Â° C. for 24 hours. When the reaction was complete, water was added to the reaction solution, dichloromethane was used to perform an extraction, an anhydrous MgSO4 was used to remove moisture therefrom, and a resultant therefrom was filtered and concentrated under a reduced pressure. This obtained residue was separated and purified through column chromatography.
