CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS Not Applicable STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not Applicable THE NAMES OF THE PARTIES TO A JOINT RESEARCH AGREEMENT Not applicable INCORPORATION-BY-REFERENCE OF MATERIAL SUBMITTED ON A COMPACT DISC Not Applicable BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention Cancer has been a persistent, serious health problem for several decades now. While treatment methods have improved, cancer continues to affect millions of lives every year. Additionally, existing treatments typically involve either surgery for removing a cancerous growth, or chemotherapy to destroy cancer cells that cannot be operated on. These methods can be invasive to the body, and also potentially create serious side effects for the patient. The present invention allows for a much less intrusive method for treating all forms of cancer. 2. Description of Related Art While there are many patents and publications that are intended to treat and cure cancer, none use the precise combination of treatment solution and treatment procedure of the present invention. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a process for treating cancer. A solution is created from existing chemicals and the solution is injected into a patient to destroy existing cancer cells. The patient is injected based on a fixed dosing regimen. After the dosing regimen is completed, the patient is observed for a set time period. If cancer cells still exist after the observation period, the dosing regimen is repeated. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS The invention is a process for the treatment of cancer with the steps of the process illustrated in the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof and wherein: FIG. 1 is a flowchart depicting the steps in the overall process of the treatment. FIG. 2 is a flowchart depicting the steps involved in creating the treating mixture. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention is carried out as illustrated in FIGS. 1-2. This invention is used to treat all forms of cancer in a less intrusive manner for the patient. The first step of the process 100 is to create the solution that will be injected into a patient to destroy existing cancer cells. To prepare this treatment solution 100, requires a specific combination of chemicals mixed using a specific set of steps. Four vials holding four distinct chemical solutions will be mixed together to create the treating mixture. The first vial will preferably hold a liquid sulfonic acid. A sulfonic acid substitute that has very similar chemical properties could potentially be used, but sulfonic acid itself would be the most effective first ingredient. The second vial will preferably hold a liquid carbonic acid. A carbonic acid substitute that has very similar chemical properties could potentially be used, but carbonic acid itself would be the most effective second ingredient. The third vial will preferably hold a liquid mixture of puromycin and ammonium chloride. Substitutes that have very similar chemical properties to either puromycin or ammonium chloride could potentially be used, but puromycin and ammonium chloride themselves would be the most effective ingredients to form this mixture for the third ingredient. The fourth vial will preferably hold a liquid mixture of aminobenzoic acid and undecylenic acid. Substitutes that have very similar chemical properties to either aminobenzoic acid or undecylenic acid could potentially be used, but aminobenzoic acid and undecylenic acid themselves would be the most effective ingredients to form this mixture for the fourth ingredient. After preparing the four vials with their corresponding ingredients, the four vials are mixed together. It is critical that upon mixture, the solution is not stirred. After mixing the vials, the resulting solution is allowed to settle for a certain time period. The preferred time period for this settling is ten days. After the solution has been allowed to settle, the solution will be briefly stirred, and then placed into a refrigerator for a set cooling period. The preferred time period for this cooling period is three days. After the cooling period, the solution is ready to be injected into the patient. When injecting the patient with the solution, a fixed dosing regimen 101 is followed. This preferred dosing regimen 101 requires the patient to be injected the solution once a week for four weeks. The dosing regimen requires a dose of 1 cubic centimeter of the solution the first week, 2 cubic centimeters the second week, 2.5 cubic centimeters the third week and 3 cubic centimeters the fourth week. After this dosing regimen 101 has been completed, the cancer cells in the patient's body should be destroyed. To confirm this, the patient is observed for a fixed observation period 102. This observation period 102 is preferably for a period of six weeks. Multiple checkups can be performed within this six week period to determine whether cancer cells still exist, or whether new cancer cells exist within the patient. If it is determined that the cancer has not been cured, the treatment process 103 is begun again by following the same dosing regimen 101. 1.
