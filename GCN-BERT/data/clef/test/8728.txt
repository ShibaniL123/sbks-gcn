Field of the Invention The invention relates to a genus of 2,4-diaminoquinazolines that are useful for treating spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). Background Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a currently untreatable, autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by a deficiency of full-length survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. The symptoms are the result of progressive degeneration of motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord resulting in weakness and wasting of the voluntary muscles. Type I (Acute) SMA is also called Werdnig-Hoffmann Disease. SMA type I is evident before birth or within the first few months of life. There may be a reduction in fetal movement in the final months of pregnancy. There is a general weakness in the intercostals and accessory respiratory muscles. The chest may appear concave. Symptoms include floppiness of the limbs and trunk, feeble movements of the arms and legs, swallowing and feeding difficulties, and impaired breathing. Affected children never sit or stand and usually die before the age of 2. Type II (Chronic) SMA is usually diagnosed by 15 months. Children may have respiratory problems, floppy limbs, decreased or absent deep tendon reflexes, and twitching of arm, leg, or tongue muscles. These children may learn to sit but cannot stand or walk. Life expectancy varies. Feeding and swallowing problems are not usually characteristic of Type II, although in some patients a feeding tube may become necessary. Tongue fasciculations are less often found in children with Type II but a fine tremor in the outstretched fingers is common. Type III (Mild) SMA, often referred to as Kugelberg-Welander or Juvenile Spinal Muscular Atrophy, is usually diagnosed between 2 and 17 years of age. Symptoms include abnormal manner of walking; difficulty running, climbing steps, or rising from a chair; and slight tremor of the fingers. The patient with Type III can stand alone and walk; tongue fasciculations are seldom seen. Types I, II and III progress over time, accompanied by deterioration of the patient's condition. Type IV (Adult Onset) typically begins after age 35. Adult SMA is characterized by insidious onset and very slow progression. The bulbar muscles are rarely affected in Type IV. It is not clear that Type IV SMA is etiologically related to the Type I-III forms. There is a second type of Adult Onset X-Linked SMA, known as Kennedy's Syndrome or Bulbo-Spinal Muscular Atrophy. It occurs only in males, and, unlike the other forms of SMA, it is associated with a mutation in the gene that codes for part of the androgen receptor. The facial and tongue muscles are noticeably affected. The course of the Adult Onset disease is variable, but in general it tends to be slowly progressive or nonprogressive. Type I, II and III SMA are caused by a mutation in a part of the DNA called the survival motor neuron (SMN1) gene, which normally produces a protein called SMN. Because of their gene mutation, people with SMA make less SMN protein, which results in the loss of motor neurons. SMA symptoms may be improved by increasing the levels of SMN protein. Normally the SMN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called Survival of Motor Neuron 1. The SMN1 protein helps to assemble the cellular machinery needed to process pre-mRNA. More than 90 percent of individuals with spinal muscular atrophy lack part or all of both copies of the SMN1 gene. A small percentage of people with this condition lack one copy of the SMN1 gene and have a small type of mutation in the remaining copy. About 30 different mutations have been identified. The most frequent of these mutations replaces the amino acid tyrosine with cysteine at position 272 in the SMN1 protein. Other mutations replace amino acids at different positions or produce an abnormally short protein. As a result of these missing or altered genes, cells have a shortage of functional SMN1 protein. It remains unclear why motor neurons are particularly vulnerable to a shortage of this protein. Loss of the SMN1 protein from motor neurons results in the degeneration of these nerve cells, leading to the signs and symptoms of spinal muscular atrophy. In some cases of spinal muscular atrophy, particularly the milder cases, the SMN1 gene is replaced by an almost identical gene called SMN2. Typically, people who do not have spinal muscular atrophy have two copies of the SMN2 gene. In some affected individuals, however, the SMN2 gene replaces the SMN1 gene, and as a result, the number of SMN2 genes increases from two to three or more (and the number of SMN1 genes decreases). On a limited basis, extra SMN2 genes can help replace the protein needed for the survival of motor neurons. In general, symptoms are less severe and begin later in life in affected individuals with three or more copies of the SMN2 gene. The SMN2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called survival of motor neuron 2. This protein is made in four different versions, but only isoform d is full size and functional and appears to be identical to the SMN1 protein. The other isoforms (a, b, and c) are smaller and may not be fully functional. It appears that only a small amount of the protein made by the SMN2 gene is isoform d. Among individuals with spinal muscular atrophy (who lack functional SMN1 genes), additional copies of the SMN2 gene can modify the course of the disorder. On a limited basis, the extra SMN2 genes can help replace the protein needed for the survival of motor neurons. Spinal muscular atrophy still occurs, however, because most of the proteins produced by SMN2 genes are isoforms a, b, and c, which are smaller than the SMN1 protein and cannot fully compensate for the loss of SMN1 genes. A recent article by Cartegni and Krainer [Nature Genetics 30, 377-384 (2002)] suggests that the molecular basis for the failure of the nearly identical gene SMN2 to provide full protection against SMA stems from inefficient recognition of an exonic splicing enhancer by the splicing factor SF2/ASF. Even so, the small amount of full-sized protein produced from three or more copies of the SMN2 gene can delay onset and produce less severe symptoms, as seen in spinal muscular atrophy, types II and m. One of the first studies on pharmaceutical therapy for spinal muscular atrophy has demonstrated that, in cultured cells, valproic acid increases production of normal protein produced by the SMN2 gene. While preliminary, these studies [Britcha et al. Human Molecular Genetics,12, 2481-2489 (2003); Sumner et al. Annals of Neurology, 54, 647-654 (2003)], suggest that valproic acid or related drugs may be able to halt or even reverse the course of SMA. The study used cultured cells taken from patients with SMA type I, and demonstrated a dose-related increase in gene activity, increasing production of functional SMN protein by 30 to 50 percent. Unfortunately, treatment with valproic acid can lead to liver toxicity, especially in children under 2 years of age, and safe doses of the drug may not be able to increase the amount of SMN protein enough to reduce symptoms of the disease. However, valproic acid belongs to a class of drugs known as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, and persons of skill in the art believe that other HDAC inhibitors may be useful for treating SMA. For example, two other HDAC inhibitor, sodium butyrate and phenylbutyrate have also been shown to increase SMN expession [Chang et al. PNAS, 98, 9808-9813 (2001); Andreassi et al. European Journal of Human Genetics, 12, 59-65. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) is currently undertaking studies to support this hypothesis. International Patent Application Publication Number WO2005/123724 describes certain compounds for the treatment of SMA. It would be useful to have compounds that promote SMN2 without the adverse side effects of valproic acid. It would be further useful to have compounds that increase the total SMN1 protein or that alter the splicing to provide increase in full length to Δ7 SMN transcripts ratio in favor of full length protein or that do both.

A comprehensive list of abbreviations utilized by organic chemists (i.e. persons of ordinary skill in the art) appears in the first issue of each volume of the Journal of Organic Chemistry. The term "halogen" means fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. It will be understood that "substitution", "substituted" or "substituted with" includes the implicit proviso that such substitution is in accordance with permitted valence of the substituted atom and the substituent, and that the substitution results in a stable compound, e.g., which does not spontaneously undergo transformation such as by rearrangement, cyclization, elimination, etc. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids or bases including inorganic acids and bases and organic acids and bases. When the compounds of the present invention are basic, salts may be prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic acids including inorganic and organic acids. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts for the compounds of the present invention include acetic, benzenesulfonic (besylate), benzoic, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethenesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, isethionic, lactic, maleic, malic, mandelic, methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, succinic, sulfuric, tartaric acid, p-toluenesulfonic, and the like. When the compounds contain an acidic side chain, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts for the compounds of the present invention include metallic salts made from aluminum, calcium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, sodium and zinc or organic salts made from lysine, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, meglumine (N-methylglucamine) and procaine. As used herein, reference to "treatment" of a patient is intended to include palliation and prophylaxis. The term "method of treating" when used herein means amelioration, prevention or relief from the symptoms and/or effects associated with SMA. The term "preventing" as refers to administering a medicament beforehand to forestall or obtund an attack. The person of ordinary skill in the medical art (to which the present invention is directed) recognizes that the term "prevent" is not an absolute term. In the medical art it is understood to refer to the prophylactic administration of a drug to substantially diminish the likelihood or seriousness of a condition, and this is the sense intended when the term is used herein. The compounds of the invention/disclosure may also be broadly protective in other motor neuron disorders, such as primary lateral sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and peripheral motor neuron axonopathy as well as neurodegenerative disorders involving other classes of neurons, such as Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. Compounds described herein may contain one or more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-. The present invention/disclosure is meant to include all such possible isomers, as well as their racemic and optically pure forms and mixtures thereof in any range or proportion. Optically active (R)- and (S)- forms may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. When the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. The configuration of any carbon-carbon double bond appearing herein is selected for convenience only and is not intended to designate a particular configuration; thus a carbon-carbon double bond depicted arbitrarily herein as trans may be cis, trans, or a mixture of the two in any proportion. Likewise, all polymorphs and tautomeric forms are also intended to be included. Terminology related to "protecting", "deprotecting" and "protected" functionalities occurs throughout this application. Such terminology is well understood by persons of skill in the art and is used in the context of processes which involve sequential treatment with a series of reagents. In that context, a protecting group refers to a group which is used to mask a functionality during a process step in which it would otherwise react, but in which reaction is undesirable. The protecting group prevents reaction at that step, but may be subsequently removed to expose the original functionality. The removal or "deprotection" occurs after the completion of the reaction or reactions in which the functionality would interfere. Thus, when a sequence of reagents is specified; as it is in the process of the invention/disclosure, the person of ordinary skill can be readily envision those groups that would be suitable as "protecting groups". Suitable groups for that purpose are discussed in standard textbooks in the field of chemistry, such as Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis by T.W.Greene [John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1991]. The 2,4-diaminoquinazoline derivative functionalized at the C5 position may be prepared via the general scheme described by Harris et al. (J.Med.Chem. 1990, 33, 434-444). Alternatively, a more efficient route may be via reaction of an alcohol (primary, secondary or tertiary), represented by G1a, with 2,6 difluorobenzonitrile, providing the intermediate G2, which upon reaction with guanidine carbonate leads to the C5 functionalized 2,4-diaminoquinazoline, the desired product G3 (Scheme 1). General reaction scheme 1 yields the desired compounds, which bear a heteroatom, oxygen in the examples shown here, at the C5-position of the 2,4-diaminoquinazoline core. The starting material G1a may either be obtained from commercial sources or may be prepared from numerous procedures outlined in the literature. For example, alcohols may be obtained via reduction of a carboxylic acid, an ester, an aldehyde or a ketone; from olefin via hydroboration or osmylation. The reduction of a ketone with a chiral reducing agent either in catalytic mode or with equimolar use of a chiral reagent provides an alcohol of known chirality with very high %ee. The heterocyclic intermediates may contain multiple types of functional groups. For example, amino-alcohols (G4) may provide such a key intermediates. A linking heteroatom (Y = O, for example, in G1a) may be reacted first, and then the second functional group may be derivatized with an appropriate reagent (G10, where Z= CH2, CHR, C(=O), SO2, CH2-C(=O) etc.) either before construction of the 2,4-diaminoaquinazoline core (G7 -> G13 -> G11) or after the 2,4 diaminoquinazoline core is constructed (G9 -> G11). Examples of these approaches are shown in Scheme 2. Functional group(s) may also be introduced after the formation of the 2,4 diaminoquinazoline core. Synthetic route(s) to the piperazine, piperizone, pyridone, and cycloalkyl analogs is shown in schemes 3, 4, 6a and 6b. The substituted piperidine analogs can be prepared by routes shown in scheme 5 and/or 7. Scheme 7 specifically shows the route for the dimethyl analog starting with commercially available dimethyl pyridine N-oxide, which is transformed to the alcohol Glx using the literature procedure (Synth. Comm. (1998), 28(20), 3817-25). The pyridine analog G1y is then reduced (hydrogenated) with rhodium on alumina in ethanol and the piperidine nitrogen is functionalized or protected as shown in schemes above and then elaborated to the final desired products as detailed in generic scheme above and exemplified by specific examples below. All analogs shown in the tables with promoter activity data can be prepared following the information provided above. Experimental for the selected compounds is provided below and the analogs listed in table 1 can be prepared in analogous fashion to these procedures. Reference can also be made to PCT WO2005/123724.

All compounds were screened using an in vitro based SMN2 promoter assay. We used NSC-34 cells, a hybrid cell line between mouse spinal cord cells and mouse neuroblastoma cells. NSC-34 cells harbor an expression plasmid containing a 3.4 kb promoter fragment of the SMN2 gene driving β-lactamase expression. For biological evaluation the NSC-34 cells are incubated (60,000 cells/well) with 10 and 50 µM of compound for 19 hours. Following the incubation, the cells are further incubated for three hours with the β-lactamase substrate CCF2-AM (Invitrogen) (Zlokarnik et. al., 1998. Science vol. 279, pp. 84). CCF2-AM diffuses across the plasma membrane and is converted into an active β-lactamase substrate by cytoplasmic esterase. Excitation at 409 nM leads to fluorescence resonance energy transfer and reemission of green light at 520 nM. Hydrolysis by the β-lactamase of the active substrate leads to emission at 447 nM following excitation at 409 nM. Fold induction is therefore determined by comparing the 447/520 ratios for a compound versus DMSO control (negative control). The fold induction is proportional to the extent of β-lactamase produced and in turn proportional to SMN2 promoter activation for a given compound relative to vehicle (DMSO) control. Compounds that give 1.2 to 2-fold induction at 10 uM are further tested using 12 point dose curve to obtain a EC50 value using the NSC-34 promoter assay as described above - (dose range - 30 uM to 0.0002µM). Average of 3-6 different dose curve experiments are used to obtain an average EC50 value and the fold induction at maximum stimulation. These values are used to rank activities of the compounds and derive structure activity relationship. The promoter assay data for various of these examples is shown in Tables 1-6. Compounds with EC50 <luM are designated "1"; compounds with EC50 1-5 uM are designated "2"; compounds with EC50 5-10 µM are designated "3"; compounds with EC50 10-20 µM are designated "4". Human DHFR assay data is also presented for various compounds in Tables 1-5. The assay is an adaptation for 96-well plate format from Appleman et al. (Appleman, JR; Howell, EE; Kraut, J; Kuhl, M and Blakley, RL (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 9187-9198). Human, recombinant dihydrofolate reductase (Sigma, D6566) was incubated along with test compounds (119 pM-125 µM) and NADPH (Sigma, N-7505) in 96-well plates. After a 10 min. pre-incubation at room temperature, dihydrofolic acid (Sigma, D7006) was added and the kinetic traces at 340nm measured on a Spectra Max 190 plate reader at room temperature. Reaction rates were determined from the slopes of the linear portions of the progress curves. The final assay conditions were 0.014 units DHFR, 300µM NADPH, 30µM Dihydrofolic acid, 50mM TRIS, pH 7.6, 100mM NaCl and 1.25% DMSO. Each compound was measured in duplicates on every assay plate. Each assay plate contained 12 positive controls (DMSO only) and 12 negative controls (no dihydrofolic acid). All data was percent normalized with respect to controls and presented as percent inhibition. Inhibition data was analyzed using Prism and fit to a standard 4-parameter logistic equation to calculate IC50 values. In Tables 1-6, "X" or "X1" in the sub-structures under the column heading "Q + R1" is the point of attachment to the respective core structure.

compounds of formula I (e.g., any of the compounds of Examples 1-227), in the form of salts, in particular acid addition salts. Suitable salts include those formed with both organic and inorganic acids. Such acid addition salts will normally be pharmaceutically acceptable, although non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be of utility in the preparation and purification of the compound in question. Thus, preferred salts include those formed from hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulphuric, citric, tartaric, phosphoric, lactic, pyruvic, acetic, succinic, oxalic, fumaric, maleic, oxaloacetic, methanesulphonic, ethanesulphonic, p-toluenesulphonic, benzenesulphonic and isethionic acids. Salts of the compounds of the invention can be made by reacting the appropriate compound in the form of the free base with the appropriate acid. While it may be possible for the compounds of formula I to be administered as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present them as a pharmaceutical composition. According to a further aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I, II, or III, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically carriers thereof and optionally one or more other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. The formulations include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous and intraarticular), rectal and topical (including dermal, buccal, sublingual and intraocular) administration. The most suitable route may depend upon the condition and disorder of the recipient. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into association a compound of the invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof ("active ingredient") with the carrier, which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. Formulations of the present invention/disclosure suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste. A tablet may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, lubricating, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide sustained, delayed or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions, which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Formulations for parenteral administration also include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions, which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose of multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of a sterile liquid carrier, for example saline, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or the like, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with the usual carriers such as cocoa butter or polyethylene glycol. Formulations for topical administration in the mouth, for example buccally or sublingually, include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavoured basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in a basis such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing an effective dose, as hereinbelow recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient. It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations of this invention/disclosure may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavouring agents. The compounds of the invention/disclosure may be administered at a dose from 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day. The dose range for adult humans is generally from 0.05 mg to 10 g/day. Tablets or other forms of presentation provided in discrete units may conveniently contain an amount of compound of the invention which is effective at such dosage or as a multiple of the same, for instance, units containing 5 mg to 500 mg, usually around 10mg to 200mg. The precise amount of compound administered to a patient will be the responsibility of the attendant physician. The dose employed will depend on a number of factors, including the age and sex of the patient and the severity of the disorder. Also, the route of administration may vary depending on the condition and its severity. Combination therapy is possible with any combination of agents that improve SMA; those that operate by a mechanism independent of promotion of SMN2 may offer additional advantages. Combination therapy can be achieved by administering two or more agents, each of which is formulated and administered separately, or by administering two or more agents in a single formulation. Other combinations are also encompassed by combination therapy. For example, two agents can be formulated together and administered in conjunction with a separate formulation containing a third agent. While the two or more agents in the combination therapy can be administered simultaneously, they need not be. For example, administration of a first agent (or combination of agents) can precede administration of a second agent (or combination of agents) by minutes, hours, days, or weeks. While in many cases it is desirable that the two or more agents used in a combination therapy be present in within the patient's body at the same time, this need not be so. Combination therapy can also include two or more administrations of one or more of the agents used in the combination. For example, if agent X and agent Y are used in a combination, one could administer them sequentially in any combination one or more times, e.g., in the order X-Y-X, X-X-Y, Y-X-Y, Y-Y-X, X-X-Y-Y, etc. Examples of drugs that improve SMA include, but are not limited to valproic acid, hydroxybutyrate, phenylbutyrate, phenylbutyrate derivatives, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and methylase inhibitors. Exemplary HDAC inhibitors include, but are not limited to, valproic acid, hydroxybutyrate, phenylbutyrate, phenylbutyrate derivatives, trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). An exemplary methylase inhibitor is 5-azacytidine. Other HDAC and methylase inhibitors would be obvious to one of ordinary skill. Effects of the quinazoline derivatives of formula I on SMN2 promoter induction are additive and/or synergistic with HDAC inhibitors and with methylese inhibitors.
