Step 1: methyl 2-amino(d2)acetate
To a solution of 2-[(d2)amino](d2)ethan(d)oic acid (10 g, 124.85 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in methanol (100 mL) was added thionyl chloride (36.9 g, 2.50 equiv) dropwise at 0° C. The reaction was stirred at 65° C. for 4 h. Then the mixture was concentrated in vacuo to afford 11 g (97%) of methyl 2-amino(d2)acetate as a white solid.
