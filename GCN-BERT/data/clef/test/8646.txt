TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a kind of method for continuous preparation of AKD (alkyl or alkylketene dimer), particularly to a kind of method for sufficient mixture and continuous reaction for preparation of high purity AKD through continuous metering of raw material under condition of being free of solvent. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION AKD (alkyl or alkylketene dimer) is a kind of sizing agent for paper making. At present, the AKD products manufactured by industrial mass production are acquired by batch production. Along with the growth of market demand, this production method has major limitations and defects such as great quality fluctuation, high labor cost, high consumption of raw materials and energy, etc. Recently, the continuous preparation of AKD has become the development trend of large-scale mass production. Both European patent EP0550107 and Chinese patent CN1596252A disclose the methods for continuous preparation of AKD, but above-mentioned methods continuously feed all of raw materials acyl chloride and tertiary amine according to certain proportion for a single time, which causes the sudden rise of reaction temperature, sharp increase of material viscosity and difficult operation to fail to acquire the high purity products. Chinese patent CN101845030A also discloses a kind of method for continuous preparation of AKD. This patent applies the specially designed reactor, with main body of conveyor carrying discontinuous propeller blades with fixed stirring rods inserted in the spacing of propeller blades. In two embodiments, one of raw materials tertiary amine is fed for a single time and the other raw material acyl chloride is fed for two times. And the product purity is greatly improved in comparison with control product. Although the iodine value of product could be stable at 43, the iodine value is about 2 less than that of products from batch production and the melting point is about 0.5~10C lower, which indicates that a lot of impurity exists, the product purity is not high enough and the product quality is not good; if the raw material acyl chloride is fed for three times, the product purity is not obviously improved due to limitation of reactor length, short reaction time and insufficient stirring especially during feeding of last batch of raw materials. The causes affecting the above-mentioned product quality are: (1) under the condition of being free from solvent, the reaction is very fast and even if one of materials acyl chloride is fed through two points, the heat of reaction is released quite concentratively and the reaction temperature is hard to control and the material viscosity is high; (2) this reactor relies on discontinuous propeller blade for shearing and kneading and its structure is simple and axial and radial mixing strength is low with poor self-cleaning capability, so that seizing and wall accretion might occur inside the reactor and the difficult heat dissipation causes the rising of reaction temperature and increasing material viscosity to result in insufficient mixture of materials and finally cause the insufficient dimerization reaction of acyl chloride and tertiary amine and failure of continuous preparation of high purity AKD products. Therefore, the topic of present invention is how to improve the process and device for realization of continuous preparation of high purity AKD products.

The applied acyl chloride is: In the chemical equation (II), R is C8∼C22 alkyl or alkenyl. (2) Device The adopted device includes a kind of reactor which could make continuous mixing reaction of raw materials. The reactor has the axially setup internal cylinder and external cylinder. Under the operating state, the internal cylinder is driven by motor to rotate in relation to external cylinder to form an annular column passage between internal cylinder and external cylinder. The annular column passage is set with conveying section and mixing section along the axial direction and the conveying section and mixing section are arranged one after another along the axial direction of annular column passage. And the conveying section is set with blades to convey and mix the materials and the bottom of blades is fixed to the internal cylinder and the tip of blades is fitted with inner wall of external cylinder; the mixing section is set with shearing blades and kneading blades to shear and mix the materials. The shearing blade consists of supporting block and shearing rod.

The kneading blade consists of support bar and kneading block; one end of support bar is fixed on the external cylinder and the other end is connected to kneading block; one side of kneading block is fitted with outer wall of internal cylinder; the above-mentioned reactor is set with one tertiary amine feeding port, 3-10 acyl chloride feeding ports and one outlet connecting the annular column passage; one tertiary amine feeding port and first acyl chloride feeding port are located at one end of axial direction of annular column passage in reactor, one outlet is located at the other end of axial direction of annular column passage and the other acyl chloride feeding ports are alternatively arranged along the axial direction of annular column passage from the first acyl chloride feeding port; the above-mentioned reactor has two sets of internal and external heat exchange systems, wherein the internal heat exchange system uses the wall of internal cylinder as heat exchange interface and it consists of pipeline, heat exchange medium and inner chamber of internal cylinder; the external heat exchange system uses the wall of external cylinder as heat exchange interface and it consists of pipeline, heat exchange medium and water jacket at outskirt of internal cylinder; (3) Preparation process Step 1: Prepare the raw materials required for continuous feeding into reactor according to the mole ratio of 1.05~1.2:1 between tertiary amine and acyl chloride within any unit time and feed the acyl chloride required for continuous feeding into reactor through three to ten lines and the feeding amount of acyl chloride in each line shall be 10~60% of total feeding amount of acyl chloride within any unit time; Step 2: Use the metering pump to continuously feed the tertiary amine through the mentioned tertiary amine feeding port in reactor according to the requirement of Step 1 and use the metering pump to continuously feed the acyl chloride through the corresponding three to ten acyl chloride feeding ports in three to ten lines according to the requirement of Step 1. Under the operating state of reactor, the main motor drives the internal cylinder to rotate in relation to external cylinder, forcing the fed materials to be conveyed and stirred by blades in the conveying section of annular column passage and forcing the fed materials to be sheared and mixed by relative movement of shearing blades and kneading blades at mixing section of annular column passage. Due to multiple feedings of acyl chloride and alternate arrangement of conveying section and mixing section along the axial direction of annular column passage, it causes the sufficient dimerization reaction of fed materials and gradually moves the materials from feeding ports of reactor to outlet along the annular column passage. During the dimerization reaction process of materials, it uses two sets of internal and external heat exchange systems to control the temperature of materials inside the reactor between 50°C and 100°C and control the material viscosity in range of 1∼70 Pa·s. The duration period of materials inside the reactor is 5~20 minutes until the reaction products are discharged continuously from outlet; Step 3: The reaction products discharged continuously from outlet of reactor fall to the continuous extractor. Continuously feed diluted mineral acid solution to continuous extractor for dispersion with reaction products to get the extracted mixing solution, which is finally conveyed to settling basin for separation of oil phase and water phase. The oil phase on the top is molten AKD product and discharged from overflow port of settling basin and the water phase at the bottom is tertiary amine mineral acid solution and discharged from the lower port of settling basin. The above described technical solution is explained as follows: 1. In above described technical solution, the mentioned tertiary amine could be one of following substances in chemical equation (I): triethylamine; dimethylcyclohexylamine; dimethylisopropylamine.

In above described technical solution, during the Step 2 of mentioned preparation process, preferred temperature of materials in reactor is controlled to be 50∼90°C and the optimal temperature range is 55∼85°C.4. In above described technical solution, after the separation of oil phase and water phase during Step 3 of mentioned preparation process, as the reaction product viscosity prepared by present invention is low, it could be discharged by overflow from top of reactor.5. In above described technical solution, during Step 3 of mentioned preparation process, the mentioned diluted mineral acid solution could be diluted hydrochloric acid solution or diluted sulphuric acid solution.6. In above described technical solution, after completion of Step 3 of mentioned preparation process, the AKD by continuous preparation could be directly emulsified to be AKD emulsion; or rinsed, dehydrated and cooled for selling. The tertiary amine mineral acid solution shall be collected for treatment and the tertiary amine could be recycled.7. In above described technical solution, AKD is dimer of alkyl ketene or alkenyl ketene with structural formula: Wherein, R is C8~C22 alkyl or alkenyl. The operating principle of present invention is: the reaction to generate AKD includes the dimerization of acyl chloride dehydrochlorination and neutralization of hydrogen chloride and tertiary amine. The equation of acyl chloride and tertiary amine is: Under condition of being free from solvent, the characteristic of acyl chloride and tertiary amine reaction is that the reaction is very fast and the heat release is intense, which causes sharp increase of material viscosity to result in difficult control of reaction and insufficient reaction of materials to affect the purity of products. When all materials react concentratively, the material temperature rises sharply and viscosity is far above 100 Pa·s so that the normal stirring and heat transfer are not possible. Relevant researches show that the crystalline forms of tertiary amine hydrochloride are quite different under different conditions. When the solvent is not available, the molar (or slightly excessive amount of tertiary amine) reaction of acyl chloride and tertiary amine could generate the branched long and thin crystal; when the solvent or greatly excessive amount of tertiary amine is available, it will generate the thick and orthorhombic crystal. Under the first scenario, the material viscosity is high and it's difficult to achieve the sufficient mixing effect through mechanical force such as stirring or shearing and the heat of reaction could not be transferred in time, so the temperature is hard to control. Especially the branched long and thin crystal could enclose some unreacted acyl chloride and tertiary amine to have incomplete reaction to lower the product quality. Under the second scenario, due to the availability of solvent or greatly excessive amount of tertiary amine, it improves the reaction condition to generate thicker crystal, greatly lower the material viscosity, reduce the enclosure and entrainment of raw materials, have safer reaction and improve the product purity. However, the solvent recovery process devices are complicated and it increases the energy consumption and environmental pollution; the greatly excessive amount of tertiary amine increases the recovery cost. Neither of two solutions are feasible. The present invention puts forward a novel process operation and special device to solve the problem. The concept of present invention is to reinforce the mixture of reaction materials under the condition of being free from solvent to make the reactant viscosity controllable on the basis of reactant temperature being controllable to achieve the product quality controllable, i.e. to stable and continuous preparation of high purity AKD. Firstly, continuously feed the tertiary amine (one of raw materials) through the mentioned tertiary amine feeding port in reactor and continuously feed the acyl chloride (the other raw material) through the corresponding three to ten acyl chloride feeding ports of reactor in three to ten lines, i.e. the tertiary amine and a portion of acyl chloride are continuously fed for reaction simultaneously. The tertiary amine is greatly excessive relatively to serve the function of solvent or dilution. Under such environment, the generated amine salt has better crystal form and the enclosure of unreacted material is reduced. Then, continuously feed the acyl chloride through other feeding ports along the length direction of reactor to greatly disperse the heat of reaction to make it easy to control the reaction process. Secondly, the materials are always sheared and stirred at the conveying section of reactor when the materials are conveyed to achieve the main mixture of materials along the axial direction and the stirring rods in the spacing of blades could scrape off the materials sticking on the wall of internal cylinder to prevent the seizing of materials. The present invention has another critical element: the mentioned annular column passage is equipped with mixing section in axial direction and the mixing section is equipped with shearing blades and kneading blades to shear and mix the materials. On one side, it forces the sufficient shearing and mixing of fed materials during relative movement of shearing blades and kneading blades in the mixing section of annular column passage to reinforce the mixing of viscous materials in radial direction; on the other side, it realizes the self-cleaning, i.e. the shearing rod on the shearing blade could scrape off the materials sticking on the inner wall of external cylinder to prevent the wall accretion on external cylinder and the kneading block on the kneading blade could scrape off the materials sticking on the outer wall of internal cylinder to prevent the seizing of internal cylinder to reduce the thermal resistance and transfer the heat effectively to increase the opportunity for material reaction and ensure the sufficient detention period. Thirdly, the heat of reaction generated from the conveying section and mixing section is controlled by the two sets of internal and external heat exchange systems on reactor to further control the temperature of reaction materials. Due to application of above described technical solution, the present invention has following advantages and effects in comparison with current technology: the application of process of present invention could realize the disperse generation of reaction heat and maintain excellent heat transfer, sufficient material mixture and complete reaction to make it easy to control the reaction temperature and material viscosity, lower the reaction material viscosity 10~70 Pa·s, decrease the generation of side reaction and lower the impurity to ensure the high purity of products.
