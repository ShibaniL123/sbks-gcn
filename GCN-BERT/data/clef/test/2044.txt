[Technical Field] The present invention relates to a coating solution for gas barrier, a gas barrier laminate having a gas barrier layer formed using the aforementioned coating solution for gas barrier, a packaging material including the aforementioned gas barrier laminate and a packaging material for heat sterilization. This application claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2012-245307 filed November 7, 2012, the description of which is incorporated herein. [Background Art] If foods, drugs, cosmetics, agrichemicals, industrial products and the like are preserved for a long time, the qualities are sometimes deteriorated because of oxygen. Accordingly, as packaging materials for these goods, there has been used film or sheets having oxygen gas barrier properties. As the packaging materials, conventionally, materials including an aluminum foil as a gas barrier layer are often used. However, if the packaging material including an aluminum foil is used, the contents cannot be seen, and a metal detector cannot be used. Accordingly, especially in the food field and drug medicine field, there has been a need for development of a highly gas-impermeable and transparent packaging material. For this need, there has been suggested and used a gas barrier laminate in which a layer made of polyvinylidene chloride (PVDC) is provided by applying a coating solution containing PVDC. The layer made of PVDC is transparent and gas-impermeable. However, PVDC has a concern of generating dioxin during incineration. Accordingly, change from PVDC to non-chlorine material has been advanced, for example, using polyvinylacohol (PVA)-based polymer in place of PVDC has been suggested. A layer made of a PVA-based polymer is dense because of hydrogen bonds of hydroxyl groups, and shows high gas barrier properties under a low-humidity atmosphere. However, layers made of PVA-based polymers have a problem that, under a high-humidity atmosphere, the gas barrier properties significantly lower, since hydrogen bonds loosen because of moisture absorption. Accordingly, gas barrier laminates using layers made of PVA-based polymers as gas barrier layers cannot be used in packaging material for foods and the like containing much moisture in many cases, and so their use has been limited to packaging material for dry substances, and the like. For the sake of improving gas barrier properties under a high-humidity atmosphere, a method for adding inorganic lamellar compounds to PVA-based polymers has been suggested (see PTL1). However, also in the method of PTL1, since waterproofness of the PVA-based polymer itself is not improved, the problem of lowering of gas barrier properties under a high-humidity atmosphere has remained. In order to improve gas barrier properties under a high humidity atmosphere, there has been suggested a method for producing a gas barrier laminate by applying a coating solution containing a PVA-based polymer and a polymer which can form a cross-link structure with the PVA-based polymer on a substrate and by performing a heat treatment (PTLs 2 to 6). However, in this method, for obtaining sufficient gas barrier properties, the heat treatment after applying the coating solution needs to be performed at a high temperature, for example, at 150°C or higher to form the cross-link structure. Depending on the materials of the substrate, for example, when the material of the substrate is a polyolefin such as polypropylene (OPP) or polyethylene (PE), the heat treatment causes significant damage to the substrate. Accordingly, there is a need for a gas barrier laminate which can be produced under milder conditions. As the method for forming the gas barrier layer, there has been also suggested a method where a layer containing polycarbonate-based polymer such as polyacrylic acid is formed and the above-described polycarbonate-based polymer is ion-crosslinked with multivalent metallic ions (see PTLs 7 to 8). This method does not need the heat treatment at a high temperature as in the methods described in PTLs 2 to 6. Accordingly, polyolefin can be used as the substrate. The obtained gas barrier layer is highly gas-impermeable even under a high humidity atmosphere, and can be used for uses where it is subjected to a heat sterilization treatment such as boiling or a retort. However, if polycarbonate-based polymer and a multivalent metallic compound are formulated into the same coating solution, especially when water is used as a solvent, polycarbonate-based polymer and the multivalent metallic compound react with each other in the coating solution, which is likely to cause a precipitate. Accordingly, in this method, when the gas barrier layer is formed, a layer containing the polycarbonate-based polymer and a layer containing the multivalent metallic compound are formed separately, or an aqueous solution of a multivalent metal salt is contacted with the layer containing the polycarbonate-based polymer. However, in this case, there is a problem of increase in the number of steps.

[Description of Embodiments] <Coating Solution for Gas Barrier> A gas barrier coating solution (also referred to simply as coating solution, below) according to a first embodiment of the present invention is characterized in that the coating solution contains an ammonium salt of a polymer including a carboxyl group (also referred to as polymer containing a carboxyl group, below) (A) (also referred to as constituent (A), below), a particulate multivalent metallic compound (B) (also referred to as constituent (B), below) and water, the content of the multivalent metallic compound (B) is 0.5 to 2.0 times the chemical equivalent of the ammonium salt (A), and the mean particle size of the multivalent metallic compound (B) is 4 µm or less. [Constituent (A)] The constituent (A) is the ammonium salt of the polymer containing a carboxyl group. It is preferred that the polymer containing a carboxyl group is a polymer which has, in a molecule of the polymer, two or more building blocks each containing at least one carboxyl group. The polymers containing a carboxyl group can include, for example, a polymer of an unsaturated carboxylic acid having an ethylenic double bond in the molecule; a copolymer of the aforementioned unsaturated carboxylic acid and another monomer; and acid polysaccharides having a carboxyl group in the molecule, such as alginic acid, carboxymethyl cellulose and pectin. The aforementioned unsaturated carboxylic acids can include acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid, fumaric acid and crotonic acid. Unsaturated monomers capable of copolymerizing with the aforementioned unsaturated carboxylic acid are preferred to be unsaturated monomers having an ethylenic double bond in the molecule, and can include, for example, olefins (ethylene, propylene, etc.), vinyl saturated carboxylate esters (vinyl acetate, etc.), alkyl unsaturated carboxylate esters (alkyl acrylate, alkyl methacrylate, alkyl itaconate, etc.), vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, styrene, acrylamide, acrylonitrile, and the like. The polymers of unsaturated carboxylic acid may be homopolymers or copolymers where two or more types of unsaturated carboxylic acids are copolymerized. The unsaturated carboxylic acid and the other monomer used for copolymers of the unsaturated carboxylic acid and the other monomer may be one, two or more types, respectively. The polymer containing a carboxyl group is preferred to be a polymer of an unsaturated carboxylic acid in view of gas barrier properties of a formed coat layer, transparency and so on, and further preferred to be at least one selected from homopolymers and copolymers of monomers selected from acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, and itaconic acid, especially preferred to be at least one selected from homopolymers and copolymers of monomers selected from acrylic acid and methacrylic acid. The weight-average molecular weight of the polymer containing a carboxyl group (in a state where it is not neutralized with ammonia) is preferred to be within a range of 2,000 to 10,000,000, and further preferred to be within a range of 5,000 to 1,000,000. If the weight-average molecular weight is 2,000 or more, the formed coat layer has good flexibility and waterproofness. If the weight-average molecular weight is 10,000,000 or less, the viscosity of raw materials is low enough to bring ease of handling. Further, because the viscosity of the coating solution thereof is also low enough, the constituent (B) is unlikely to aggregate and a coating solution where the constituent (B) is uniformly dispersed can readily be obtained. It should be noted that the above-described weight-average molecular weight is a weight-average molecular weight in terms of polystyrene which is measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The constituent (A) is obtained by neutralizing the polymer containing a carboxyl group with ammonia (water). It can also be obtained by polymerizing an ammonium salt of the aforementioned unsaturated carboxylic acid. Regarding the constituent (A), the pH when the constituent (A) is dissolved in water to prepare an aqueous solution of concentration of 10 mass % is preferred to be within a range of 7.0 to 9.0, and further preferred to be within a range of 7.5 to 8.5. If the pH is under 7.0, cross-links might be formed between the carboxyl group which has not been neutralized with ammonia yet and a multivalent metallic ion, which might result in occurrence of aggregation in the coating solution. If the pH is over 9.0, ammonia odor increases, or excessive energy is needed for removing ammonia when the coating layer is formed. The pH is a value obtained at 25°C. As the constituent (A), one type may be used singularly, or two or more types may be used in combination. The content of the constituent (A) in the coating solution according to the first embodiment of the present invention is preferred to be 1 to 15 mass%, and further preferred to be 1.5 mass% to 10 mass%, relative to the gross mass of the coating solution. If the content of the constituent (A) is 1 mass% or more, a coating layer having sufficient thickness is formed, which eliminates the need to apply much coating solution. Accordingly, a uniform layer can be formed readily. If the content of the constituent (A) is 15 mass% or less, the viscosity of the coating solution is low enough, the constituent (B) is unlikely to aggregate excessively, and the coating solution where the constituent (B) is uniformly dispersed can be obtained readily. [Constituent (B)] The constituent (B) is the particulate multivalent metallic compound. According to the present invention, the multivalent metallic compound contained in a coating solution is particulate, i.e. the multivalent metallic compound, when kept in the coating solution, keeps shapes of particles of solid having a size detectable by a laser diffraction and scattering method. The particles may be primary particles or aggregated particles where primary particles gather. The size of particles is represented as the mean particle size. The multivalent metallic compound is a compound of metal (multivalent metal) where the valence of the metallic ion is two or more. Examples of the multivalent metal can include alkali earth metals such as magnesium and calcium, transition metals such as titanium, zirconium, chrome, manganese, iron, nickel, copper and zinc, aluminum, and the like. Examples of the multivalent metallic compounds can include, for example, an oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate of the aforementioned multivalent metal, and the like. In order to exist having a particular shape in the coating solution containing water, the multivalent metallic compound is preferred to have low solubility in water, for example, one whose solubility is 5.0 g or less at 25°C in 1 L of water is preferred. The constituent (B) is preferred to be a multivalent metallic compound made of at least one type selected from an oxide, hydroxide and carbonate of the multivalent metal selected from zinc, magnesium and calcium in view of low solubility, gas barrier properties, stability of the coating solution, and the like, and especially preferred to be one made of at least one type selected from zinc oxide and magnesium oxide. The mean particle size of the constituent (B) in the coating solution is 4 µm or less, preferably 3 µm or less, more preferably 2 µm or less, and most preferably 1µm or less. If the mean particle size of the constituent (B) is 4 µm or less, stability of the coating solution, gas barrier properties of the formed coat layer, transparency, and the like are improved. The lower limit of the mean particle size of the constituent (B) is not limited especially in view of the above-described effects, but 50 nm or more is preferred, 100 nm or more is further preferred, and 150 nm or more is most preferred. If the mean particle size is 50 nm or more, it is useful when the gas barrier laminate obtained using this coating solution is used for packaging materials for heat sterilization. If the mean particle size is comparatively large, cross-linking of the carboxyl group and the multivalent metallic ion is slowly formed, which keeps the cross-link formation rate low before any heat sterilization process such as a retort treatment. Accordingly, it is resistant to abuse, and cracking of the coat layer is prevented even if the gas barrier laminate is subjected to abuse resistance such as folding or bending before the heat sterilization. Further, since the cross-link formation is further progressed by the following heat sterilization, sufficient barrier properties can finally be obtained. The mean particle size of the constituent (B) is a median size (D50) measured by a laser diffraction and scattering method. The detailed measurement method is as shown in Examples described below. The mean particle size of the constituent (B) can be regulated by the primary particle size of the multivalent metallic compound, a dispersion process in preparing the coating solution, and the like. The coating solution can be prepared by mixing raw materials such as the constituent (A), the constituent (B) and water, followed by performing the dispersion process as needed. In many case, the constituent (B) contained in the liquid before the dispersion process is an aggregated particle where a plurality of primary particles made of the multivalent metallic compound gather. Accordingly, the mean particle size of the constituent (B) can be reduced by performing the dispersion process. The mean particle size of the constituent (B) approaches the primary particle size, as the dispersion process is carried out under more severe conditions. The dispersion process is described below in detail. The shape of the primary particle of the multivalent metallic compound may be a plate-like shape and a needle-like shape in addition to a spherical shape, depending on the shapes of the crystal of the multivalent metallic compounds. Any shape can be used as the constituent (B). The primary particle size of the multivalent metallic compound is not limited especially as long as the mean particle size in the coating solution is within a range of 4 µm or less. However, the primary particle size is preferred to be 1 µm or less, further preferred to be 100 nm or less. The primary particle size is obtained by observing the particles with a scanning electron microscope or a transmission electron microscope, followed by measuring the unidirectional particle diameter from the obtained image. Regarding multivalent metallic compounds having a plate-like shape or a needle-like shape, the length of the longest side is defined as the primary particle size. As the constituent (B), one type may be used singularly, or two or more types may be used in combination. The content of the constituent (B) in the coating solution according to the first embodiment of the present invention is 0.5 to 2.0 times the chemical equivalent of the constituent (A), and preferred to be 0.7 to 1.5 times. If the content of the constituent (B) is under 0.5 times, since there are not enough multivalent metallic ions to cross-link the carboxyl group, the waterproofness of the coat layer becomes insufficient, which might cause the gas barrier properties to lower under a high-humidity atmosphere. Further, since the heat-resistance also becomes insufficient, the gas barrier properties might lower during heat sterilization such as retort treatment and boiling treatment. On the other hand, if the content of the constituent (B) is over 2.0 times, in the coat layer, excessive multivalent metallic compound which does not participate in formation of the cross-link structure inhibits formation of a dense structure. Accordingly, sufficient gas barrier properties cannot be obtained, and transparency might be deteriorated. Here, the chemical equivalent represents an amount depending on the carboxyl groups in the constituent (A) and the valence of the multivalent metal in the constituent (B). For example, the amount of the constituent (B) which satisfies that [the number of the carboxyl groups of the constituent (A) contained in the coating solution=the number of the multivalent metal in the constituent (B) x valence] is 1.0 times (1.0 eq) the chemical equivalent of the constituent (A). An example of a case where polyacrylic acid ammonium salt as the constituent (A) and zinc oxide as the constituent (B) are used is described. The molecular weight of monomer (ammonium acrylate) of the polyacrylic acid ammonium salt is 89, and a molecule of the monomer has one carboxyl group. The zinc of zinc oxide is divalent, and cross-linking is formed in a ratio of 2 carboxyl groups to 1 zinc ion. A state where all carboxyl groups of polyacrylic acid ammonium salt can cross-link with zinc ions is a state where 1 eq of zinc oxide is added to ammonium salt of polyacrylic acid. For example, if 100 g of polyacrylic acid ammonium salt is prepared, the amount of carboxyl groups therein is 1.12 mol. When 1 eq of zinc oxide is added to this, an amount for cross-linking all of the 1.12 mol of carboxyl groups in the polyacrylic acid ammonium salt is necessary. Since zinc is divalent, the amount of zinc oxide is half of 1.12 mol, i.e. 0.56 mol (45.6 g). [Water] The coating solution according to the first embodiment of the present invention contains water. The water is used as a solvent of the constituent (A) and a dispersion medium of the constituent (B). Types of the water used in the coating solution are not limited especially, but can include distillated water, ion-exchange water, ultrapure water, tap water and the like. [Organic solvent] The coating solution according to the first embodiment of the present invention may contain only water as the solvent of the constituent (A) and the dispersion medium of the constituent (B). However it may further contain an organic solvent in order to improve coatability of the coating solution or the appearance after drying. The organic solvent only has to form a uniform solution without phase-separating when it is mixed with water, and can include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol and 2-propanol. When an organic solvent is used, the content thereof only has to be within a range where the stability of the coating solution is not deteriorated. For example, if an alcohol is used as the organic solvent, the alcohol content is ordinarily preferred to be 40 mass% or less in alcohol ratio relative to the sum of the water and alcohol. [Optional Constituent] The coating solution according to the first embodiment of the present invention may further contain other constituents aside from the constituent (A) and the constituent (B), as long as the gas barrier properties of the formed gas barrier laminate and interlayer adhesiveness are not impaired. As the other constituents, there can be used other polymers except for the constituent (A) or publicly known additives as additives of the coating solution. For example, in order to improve coatability to a substrate of the gas barrier laminate or other layers (ex. anchor coat layer) optionally formed on the substrate, a surface conditioner can be added. In order to further improve waterproofness of the coat layer, a metallic alkoxide can be added. Further, in order to improve flexibility, glycerin or polysaccharide can be added. For further improving gas barrier properties of the coat layer, a lamellar compound can also be added. [pH] The pH (25°C) of the coating solution according to the first embodiment of the present invention is preferred to be within a range of 6.5 to 9.5, and further preferred to be within a range of 8.0 to 9.5. If the pH is 6.5 or more, the dispersion stability of the coating solution is good. If the pH is 9.5 or less, the gas barrier properties of the coat layer are good. [Method for Preparing Coating Solution] The coating solution can be prepared by mixing the raw materials such as the constituent (A), the constituent (B) and water, followed by performing the dispersion treatment as needed. The dispersion treatment is carried out to make the mean particle size of the constituent (B) be a predetermined value. If the mean particle size of the constituent (B) in the mixed solution before the dispersion treatment is 4 µm or less, the dispersion treatment may be omitted, but is preferred to be carried out in this case. Performing the dispersion treatment releases the aggregation, which stabilizes the coating solution and increases transparency of the gas barrier laminate obtained by applying the coating solution. Further, when the coating solution is applied and dried, the cross-link formation of the polymer containing carboxyl groups and the multivalent metallic ions is likely to progress, and a gas barrier laminate having good gas barrier properties is likely to be obtained. The methods of the dispersion treatment can include methods using a high-speed agitator, a homogenizer, a ball mill or a bead mill. Especially, if the dispersion is performed using a ball mill or a bead mill, a coating solution having dispersion stability can be obtained with high dispersion efficiency in a comparatively short time. In this case, the ball or the bead having a small diameter is better, 0.2 to 1 mm is preferred. [Functions and Effects] In the present invention, a polymer containing a carboxyl group is formulated in a form of an ammonium salt. In the present invention, as a multivalent metallic compound, a particulate multivalent compound, i.e. a multivalent metallic compound which has low solubility in water and can exist keeping the particulate shape in the coating solution containing water, is formulated. This can prevent the polymer containing a carboxyl group from being ion-crosslinked by the multivalent metallic ion during preparing the coating solution or in the coating solution after the preparation. That is, by protecting the carboxyl group in the polymer containing a carboxyl group by the ammonium ion, the carboxyl group is prevented from reacting with the multivalent metallic compound and being ion-crosslinked with the multivalent metallic ion. This can prevent generation of aggregations due to the reaction, and can make solution stability and coatability of the coating solution, transparency and thickness uniformity of the formed coat layer, and the like become good. The ammonium ion in the coating solution can be vaporized as ammonia. Accordingly, if the coating solution according to the first embodiment of the present invention is applied on the substrate by coating and drying treatment is performed for removing water and the like from the formed coating film, the ammonium ion protecting the carboxyl group can also be removed. Thereby, the carboxyl group in the polymer containing a carboxyl group is exposed, reacts with the multivalent metallic compound, and is ion-crosslinked by the multivalent metallic ion. Accordingly, the coat layer formed by drying the coating film contains the polymer containing a carboxyl group ion-crosslinked by the multivalent metallic ion. The coat layer has high waterproofness, and shows excellent gas barrier properties even under a high-humidity environment. Although described in detail below, the aforementioned coat layer also has excellent heat-resistance, abuse resistance and the like. Further, according to the coating solution based on the first embodiment of the present invention, the coat layer described above can be formed on the substrate only by coating and drying once, drying can also be performed at a low temperature at about 40 to 150°C. Therefore, a substrate having poor heat-resistance can be used, and types of the substrates are not limited. Further, the gas barrier laminate can industrially be produced readily. [Gas Barrier Laminate] A gas barrier laminate according to a second embodiment of the present invention is characterized by including a substrate and a gas barrier layer provided on at least one surface of the substrate, wherein the gas barrier layer includes a coat layer formed from the coating solution according to the first embodiment of the present invention. [Substrate] The substrate of the gas barrier laminate according to the second embodiment of the present invention is not limited especially, and various types can be used. The materials forming the substrates are not limited especially, but various types can be used, for example, the materials can include plastics, paper, and the like. The substrate may be a substrate of a single layer made of a single material, or may be a substrate of multi-layer made of multiple materials. For example, an example of the substrate of multi-layer includes a substrate where a film made of a plastic is laminated on a paper. Of these, the material forming the substrate is preferred to be a plastic, because it can be formed into various shapes and use thereof is further developed by giving gas barrier properties. The plastics are not limited especially, for example, include polyolefin resins such as polyethylene and polypropylene, polyester-based resins such as polyethylene terephthalate, polyethylene -2,6 -naphthalate, polybutylene terephthalate and copolymers thereof, polyamide-based resins such as nylon-6, nylon-66, nylon-12, meta-xylylene adipamide and copolymers thereof, styrene-based resins such as polystyrene, styrene-butadiene copolymer and styrene-butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer, poly(meth)acrylate ester, polyacrylonitrile, polyvinyl acetate, ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer, ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, polycarbonate, polyarylate, regenerated cellulose, polyimide, polyether imide, polysulfone, polyether sulfone, polyether ketone, ionomer resin and the like. If the gas barrier laminate is used in food packaging materials, of the above, the substrate is preferred to be made of polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, nylon-6 or nylon-66. The plastic forming the substrate is one type singularly or a blend of two or more types. Additives may be formulated into the plastic. Additives can properly be selected from publicly known additives such as a pigment, an oxidation inhibitor, an antistatic agent, an ultraviolet absorbing agent and a lubricant, depending on use. As the additive, one type may be used singularly, or two or more types may be used in combination. The forms of the substrates are not limited especially, for example, and can include a film, a sheet, a cup, a tray, a tube, a bottle and the like. Of these, a film is preferred. If the substrate is a film, the film may be a stretched film, or may be an unstretched film. Although the thickness of the film is not limited especially, in view of mechanical strength of the obtained gas barrier laminate and processing suitability, it is preferred to be 1 to 200 µm, and further preferred to be 5 to 100 µm. The surface of the substrate may be subjected to a plasma treatment, a corona treatment, an ozone treatment, a flame treatment, a radical activation treatment with UV or electron beams, and the like such that the coating solution can be applied on the substrate without cissing. The treatment method is chosen properly, depending on types of the substrates. [Coat Layer] The coat layer is formed from the coating solution according to the first embodiment of the present invention. Specifically, the coat layer is prepared by applying the coating solution according to the first embodiment of the present invention on the substrate by coating, followed by drying. The coat layer, as described above, contains the polymer containing carboxyl groups ion-crosslinked by the multivalent metallic ions, and shows excellent gas barrier properties even under a high-humidity atmosphere. The coat layer may be provided on one side of the substrate, or the coat layers may be provided on both surfaces. The coat layer may be provided directly on the surface of the substrate, or may be provided on a surface of another layer (ex. an anchor layer) formed on the substrate. The method for forming the coat layer is described in detail below. The thickness of the coat layer is preferably 0.01 to 5 µm, more preferably 0.05 to 2 µm, further more preferably 0.05 to 1 µm, especially preferably 0.1 to 0.5 µm. If the thickness of the coat layer is 0.01 µm or more, sufficient gas barrier properties can be obtained. If the thickness of the coat layer is 5 µm or less, a uniform coat layer can be formed readily in manufacturing, and a coat layer having no defects can be obtained readily. Abuse resistance becomes more excellent, as the thickness of the coat layer is thinner. The reason is that, when the laminate having a thick coat layer is subjected to abuse such as folding or bending, the coat layer cannot endure the stress, which is likely to cause a defect such as cracking. The stress is dispersed by making the coat layer thinner, thereby defects can be suppressed. Further, change in dimension of the gas barrier laminate is less likely to occur in a process such as printing or laminating, as the thickness of the coat layer is thinner. Abuse resistance of the gas barrier laminate becomes a problem when the substrate is a film and the like that will be deformed by hard handling. However, if the substrate is thick and hard, there is no need for considering abuse resistance of the gas barrier laminate. [Other Layers] The gas barrier laminate according to the second embodiment of the present invention may include other layers apart from the substrate and the aforementioned coat layer, as needed. For example, the gas barrier layer included in the gas barrier laminate according to the second embodiment of the present invention may be only the aforementioned coat layer. However, as the other gas barrier layers other than the aforementioned coat layer, a layer made of an inorganic compound such as aluminum oxide, silicon oxide and aluminum may be formed on the surface of the substrate by a sputtering method, an ion plating method and the like. The gas barrier laminate according to the second embodiment of the present invention may further include an anchor coat layer between the substrate and the coat layer for the sake of increasing adhesiveness between the substrate and the coat layer or enabling the coating solution to be applied without cissing by the substrate. The anchor coat layer can be formed using publicly known anchor coat agent by ordinary methods. The anchor coat agents can include, for example, an anchor coat agent containing a resin such as polyurethane resin, acrylic resin, melamine resin, polyester resin, phenol resin, amino resin or fluorine resin. As the resins, aqueous polyester resin is preferred, because it has good coatability of the coating solution according to the first embodiment of the present invention. The word aqueous means that it can dissolve or be dispersed in water. The anchor coat agent can further contain isocyanate compound aside from the resin for the sake of improving adhesiveness or hot-liquid resistance. The isocyanate compounds only has to have one or more isocyanate groups in a molecule, for example, can include hexamethylene diisocyanate, xylylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, tolylene diisocyanate, and the like. The anchor coat agent may further contain a liquid medium for dissolving and dispersing the resin or the isocyanate compound. As the liquid medium, water is preferred. An organic solvent such as isopropyl alcohol may be used in addition to water in order to improve coatability of the anchor coat agent. The anchor coat agent is preferred to contain aqueous polyester resin and an isocyanate compound, in view of wettability of the coating solution and hot-liquid resistance. The thickness of the anchor coat layer is not limited especially, its mass in a unit area is preferred to be 0.01 to 2.0 g/m2, further preferred to be 0.05 to 1.0 g/m2. If the mass in a unit area is 0.01 g/m2 or more, sufficient effect due to provision of the anchor coat layer can be obtained. If the mass in a unit area is 2.0 g/m2 or less, smoothness of the anchor coat layer becomes good, which enables the coat layer made of the coating solution according to the first embodiment of the present invention to be formed uniformly, thereby improving gas barrier properties. The surface of the anchor coat layer is preferred to have high wet tension, because the coatability of the coating solution according to the first embodiment of the present invention is improved. The wet tension of the surface of the anchor coat layer is preferred to be 45.0 mN/m or more, further preferred to be 48.0 mN/m or more. The wet tension can be estimated using a commercially available mixed solution for a wet tension test.
