The present invention relates to compositions and methods for treating coccidiosis in non-human mammals. More particularly, the invention relates to intramuscular compositions and methods for treating coccidiosis with triazines, in particular toltrazuril or ponazuril. INTRODUCTION Triazines are commonly used in the veterinary industry to treat non-human mammals against a variety of diseases. Triazines are broad-spectrum antimicrobials that inhibit both gram positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as some protozoa, such as coccidia. Coccidiosis is a parasitic disease of the intestinal tract of animals, caused by coccidian protozoa such as e.g., Eimeria or Isospora. The disease spreads from one animal to another by contact with infected feces or ingestion of infected tissue. Diarrhea, which may become bloody in severe cases, is the primary symptom. Young animals such as piglets suffer severe symptoms, which may ultimately lead to death. Triazines, such as toltrazuril and ponazuril, are authorized agents for the treatment and control of coccidiosis. They are essentially administered to the animals by oral route. In this regard, EP116175 refers to a water miscible solution of a triazine for oral administration. DE19603954 proposes triazine granules for oral administration and DE19824483 relates to semi-solid preparations which are applied orally. EP2164496 relates to triazine-iron combination products. The triazine compound is administered orally, as a suspension. Administration of triazines by transdermal application has been proposed in US2010/0179151. Transdermal application as proposed in US2010/0179151 comprises a spot on formulation which is applied on the skin and taken up by passive percutaneous absorption. Such administration route does not allow a strict control of the dosage administered to each animal. Also, transdermal administration cannot be combined with other treatments which are given by injection (e.g., antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, anthelmintics, endectocides, minerals such as iron, or vitamins). WO01/26660 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,465,460 relate to a sodium salt of triazine compounds and to compositions for oral or parenteral administration. According to this patent the sodium salt allows the use of lower doses of the compound. Although different administration routes are mentioned, all of the experimental section is limited to intravenous and oral administration. Furthermore, the patent indicates that several administrations and/or a sustained release dose are required for maintaining appropriate blood levels. In particular, the patent proposes a starting dose and several maintenance doses, which need to be administered over several days. Despite preliminary investigations on different routes (e.g., transdermal), oral administration is still preferred today because it is believed to provide the most appropriate pharmacokinetic profile of the drug, especially in young animals. In particular, while the oral formulation requires substantive manipulation and cannot provide a strict dosage control, it is believed to ensure appropriate bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of the triazine compounds. Upon infection of animals with the causative protozoan (usually within the first week of life), the first symptoms of the disease usually appear 3-5 days post-infection. Accordingly, to obtain best protection of the animals, an anti-microbial effect is required within 5 days post birth. When triazines such as toltrazuril are administered orally between days 3 to 5 after birth, a peak of toltrazuril-sulfone (i.e ponazuril), an active metabolite, may be reached in the blood at day 5, which provides a protection against the disease. Oral administration, however, presents drawbacks. Indeed, oral administration prevents strict control of the dosage administered to each animal. Also, oral administration cannot be conveniently combined with other treatments which are given by injection (e.g., antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, anthelmintics, endectocides, minerals such as iron, or vitamins) at newborn to 3 days old piglets and therefore involves additional manipulation of the animals. Such drawbacks have not been overcome in the art since alternative routes e.g., transdermal application, also have the same limitations. It has now been surprisingly found that triazines, in particular toltrazuril may be administered by intramuscular injection. Surprisingly, the inventors have found that full activity can be achieved with a single intramuscular injection of triazines, in particular toltrazuril, and that such administration in young piglets (newborn to 3 days old) can provide the required serum concentrations and release schedule of the active agent to protect the animal against infections with protozoans such as coccidia. In particular, although the intramuscular application modifies the pharmacokinetic profile of toltrazuril itself, it has now been surprisingly found that such application leads to an optimized pharmacokinetic profile of an active metabolite thereof, toltrazuril-sulfone (i.e ponazuril). The invention thus allows an efficient administration of triazines, in particular toltrazuril, even at very early stages of growth of the non-human animals. In addition, the invention allows a combined administration of a triazine with other agents that are administered early by injection, such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, anthelmintics, endectocides, minerals such as iron, or vitamins. Furthermore, contrary to the usual knowledge, the inventors have found that the combined intramuscular injection of a triazine, in particular toltrazuril, and iron complex to one-day piglets did not cause particular stress and represents a very efficient approach for treating young animals. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the invention resides in a composition comprising a triazine, preferably toltrazuril, for use in treating coccidiosis or a related disease in a non-human animal, especially in a piglet, wherein said composition is administered by intramuscular injection. Another object of the invention resides in a method for treating coccidiosis or a related diseases in a non-human animal, especially in a piglet, the method comprising the intramuscular injection to the animal of a composition comprising a triazine, preferably toltrazuril. The compositions of the invention are more preferably administered by a single intramuscular injection to the non-human mammal. The compositions of the invention are preferably administered to newborn to 3 days old animals, even more preferably newborn to 48 hours after birth. The compositions of the invention are preferably administered in a muscle of the neck or behind the ear.

The composition may comprise further active agents, such as antibiotics, anthelmintics, endectocides, anti-inflammatory agents and/or vitamins, and/or minerals such as iron, for single, grouped, separated or sequential intramuscular injection. Preferably, the triazine and the other agents are combined in the same formulation for a single intramuscular injection. In this regard, a further object of the invention resides in a composition comprising a triazine, in particular toltrazuril and a further active agent, for use in treating coccidiosis or a related disease in a non-human animal, such as a piglet, wherein said composition is administered by intramuscular injection.

In a particular embodiment, the invention is used for the preventive treatment of coccidiosis in the non-human mammal, e.g., to protect the animal against onset or development of the disease. The invention is particularly suited for protecting porcine, ovine and bovine against infectious diseases. It is particularly adapted for the treatment of a bovine or a porcine and more preferably a piglet. It may be used in adults or young animals, such as newborn to 10 days old mammals, preferably newborn to 3 days, more preferably newborn to 48 hours.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention resides in novel compositions and methods for treating coccidiosis or related diseases in non-human mammals using intramuscular triazines, in particular toltrazuril. Triazine Compounds The term “triazine(s)” designates a well-known class of active substances, especially against infections with coccidian. Typical triazines for use in a method or composition of the invention are compounds of formula A or B below, of any purity, preferably having a purity of at least 90%, as well as any salt, ester, racemate, isomer, or prodrug, thereof: wherein R1 is R3—SO2— or —S—, R2 is alkyl, alkoxy, halogen or SO2N(CH3)2, R3 is an haloalkyl R4 and R5 are independently from each other a hydrogen or Cl atom; and R6 is fluorine or chlorine, Triazine compounds include more preferably triazinediones (formula A) and triazinetriones (formula B). Examples of triazinediones include, without limitation, clazuril (R4 is Cl, R5 is H, R6 is Cl in formula A), diclazuril (R4 is Cl, R5 is Cl, R6 is Cl in formula A) or letrazuril (R4 is Cl, R5 is Cl, R6 is F in formula A). Preferred 1,2,4-triazinediones are diclazuril and sulazuril. Triazines for use in the present invention are, more preferably, triazinetriones of formula B, even more preferably wherein R2 is a C1 to C4 alkyl or alkoxy group (e.g., methyl, ethyl, or n-propyl), and/or R3 is a C1 to C3 perfluoroalkyl group (e.g., trifluoromethyl). Specific and most preferred triazines of the invention are toltrazuril (R1=R3-S-, R2=CH3, R3=CF3 in formula B) and ponazuril (R1=R3-SO2—, R2=CH3, R3=CF3 in formula B). Toltrazuril (1-methyl-3-[3-methyl-4-[4-(trifluoromethyl)tio)phenoxil]phenyl]-1,3,5-triazine(1H,3H,5H)-2,4,6-trione) is widely used in porcine, ovine, bovine and avian for the prevention and treatment of coccidiosis, by oral administration. It is currently available on the market as Cevazuril® or Baycox®. Methods for the preparation of toltrazuril are disclosed in various patents such as U.S. Pat. No. 4,219,552, U.S. Pat. No. 5,219,853, EP 0 201 030, and EP 0 879 057. The chemical structure of toltrazuril is represented in formula (C) below: The chemical structures of further examples of triazine compounds for use in the present invention are depicted in FIG. 6. The triazine(s) as defined is the present invention comprise(s) their salts such as for example sodium salts. Treatment Within the context of the invention, the term treatment includes, particularly, the preventive treatment of non-human animals against a disease. The preventive treatment of an animal against a disease designates a treatment made before the animal has been exposed to or in contact with the causative agent of the disease (e.g., a pathogen, virus, protozoan, cell, etc.), or after said exposure/contact but before development of the symptoms or at an early stage of development of the disease. Also, the term preventive treatment, in relation to a population of animals, designates the treatment of all members of the population even after the disease has been detected in certain members, to limit or avoid spreading of and contamination to the others. In a particular embodiment, the term treatment designates the protection of an animal against a disease, e.g., against the effect of an exposure to the causative agent, or against the development of the disease in exposed animals. The invention is particularly suited to protect animals against an infectious disease such as a protozoan or microbial disease. The term treatment also includes an increase in the welfare of the treated animals, for example in increasing the production of meat, milk, wool, etc. The term treatment or preventive treatment also includes the alleviation of the symptoms, as well as a delay, reduction or cure of an existing infection. Coccidiosis The term “coccidiosis” includes any disease caused by a coccidian protozoan. Coccidiosis specifically includes parasitic diseases of the intestinal tract of animals caused by coccidian protozoa such as e.g., Eimeria or Isospora. Coccidiosis typically manifests by diarrhea and/or fever. The disease can spread from one animal to another by contact with infected feces or ingestion of infected tissue. For example in piglets, the predominant sign of coccidiosis is diarrhea, which usually persists for 4 to 6 days. The faeces may vary from white to yellow in color and from a fluid to a pasty consistency, usually without the presence of blood. Coccidiosis predisposes the piglet to the incidence of secondary bacterial infections and severely affected piglets may die. Although the morbidity is usually high, mortality is variable, probably due to the difference in the number of oocysts ingested, differences in the environment and the presence of other co-existing disease problems. Although the disease has only a slight influence on mortality, it does influence the presence of concomitant infections and the amount of antibiotics needed to control them. The disease also drastically affects the development of piglets, where the daily weight gain of the infected animals decreases compared to uninfected animals, causing herds to have poor uniformity at weaning age. There is notable emaciation and stunting. Coccidiosis reduces growth by about 15% on average, that is, minimum 500 g at weaning age, and this contributes to weaning herds that are highly heterogenous Coccidiosis are frequent parasitic infectious diseases in animals. Thus, for example, protozoans from the genera Eimeria, Isospora, Neospora, Sarcosporidia, cryptosporidium, Hammondia, besnoitia, hepatozoon and Toxoplasma cause coccidiosis and protozoal diseases all over the world. The invention may be used, in particular, to prevent coccidiosis and protozoal diseases caused by various protozoans such as, more particularly, Mastigophora (Flagellata), Sarcomastigophora (Rhizopoda), Myxospora, Microspora, or pneumocystis carinii. Specific examples of Mastigophora include Trypanosomatidae such as, without limitation, Trypanosoma brucei, T. gambiense, T. rhodesiense, T. congolense, T. cruzi, T. evansi, or T. equinum. Specific examples of Sarcomastigophora (Rhizopoda) include Entamoebidae and Apicomplexa (Sporozoa) such as Eimeridae, for example E. acervuline, E. adenoides, E. alabahmensis, E. anatis, E. anseris, E. arloingi, E. ashata, E. auburnensis, E. bovis, E. brunetti, E. canis, E. chinchillae, E. clupearum, E. columbae, E. contorta, E. crandalis, E. debliecki, E. dispersa, E. ellipsoidales, E. falciformis, E. faurei, E. flavescens, E. gallopavonis, E. hagani, E. intestinalis, E. iroquoina, E. irresidua, E. labbeana, E. leucarti, E. magna, E. maxima, E. media, E. meleagridis, E. meleagrimitis, E. mitis, E. necatrix, E ninakohlyakimovae, E. ovis, E. parva, E. pavonis, E. perforans, E. phasani, E. piriformis, E. praecox, E. residua, E. scabra, E. spec., E. stiedai, E. suis, E. tenella, E. truncata, E. truttae, E. zuernii, Globidium spec., Isospora belli, L canis, L felis, L ohioensis, L rivolta, L spec., L suis, Neospora caninum, N. hugesi, Cystisospora spec., Toxoplasma gondii, Sarcocystis bovicanis, S. bovihominis, Leucozytozoon simondi, Plasmodium berghei, P. falciparum, P. malariae, P. ovate, P. vivax, P. spec., Babesia argentine, B. bovis, B. canis, B. spec., Theileria parva, Theileria spec., such as Adeleina, for example Hepatozoon canis, H. spec. Those protozoan genera and species which in pigs lead to subclinical or clinical infections must be very especially emphasized, in particular: Eimeria debliecki, E. suis, E. scabra, E. perminuta, E. spinosa, E. polita, E. porci, E. neodebtiecki, Isospora suis, Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma gondii, Sarcocystis miescheriana, S. suihominis, Babesia trautmanni, B. perroncitoi, Balantidium coli. Examples of economically important coccidioses are: infections of pigs with coccidia of the genus Isospora or of cattle with coccidia of the genus Eimeria. The invention is effective against all stages of development of the pathogen. The term “anemia” includes any iron deficiency. An object of the invention resides in a composition comprising a triazine, preferably toltrazuril, for use in treating coccidiosis or a related disease in a non-human mammal by intramuscular injection. Another object of the invention resides in a method for treating coccidiosis or a related disease in a non-human mammal, the method comprising the intramuscular injection of a composition comprising a triazine, preferably toltrazuril, to said piglet. As discussed above, the inventors have found that full activity can be achieved with a single intramuscular injection of triazines, in particular toltrazuril, and that such administration in young animals (newborn to 3 days old) can provide the required serum concentrations and release schedule of the active agent to protect the animal against infections with protozoans such as coccidia. In particular, although the intramuscular application modifies the pharmacokinetic profile of toltrazuril itself, it has now been surprisingly found that such application leads to an optimized pharmacokinetic profile of an active metabolite thereof, toltrazuril-sulfone (i.e., ponazuril). FIGS. 4 and 5 show that, upon intramuscular injection, a rapid and sustained serum level of toltrazuril sulfone is obtained, conferring optimal protection of young animals against coccidiosis. The invention thus allows an efficient administration of triazines, in particular toltrazuril, even at very early stages of growth of the animals. A particular object of the invention resides in a composition comprising a triazine for use to protect a non-human mammal against coccidiosis, wherein said composition is administered by intramuscular injection. Another object of the invention resides in a method to protect a non-human mammal against coccidiosis, the method comprising the intramuscular injection of a composition comprising a triazine to said non-human mammal. As discussed above, the triazine is preferably a derivative of 1,2,4-triazinedione or a derivative of 1,3,5-triazinetrione, and, more preferably, is toltrazuril. Intramuscular Injection An important aspect of the invention resides in the intramuscular administration route. As shown in the experimental section, the invention shows that intramuscular triazine, even after a single administration, provide effective protective effect in the treated animals, without the need for repeated injections or for long-term or slow release formulations. Furthermore, the invention shows intramuscular triazines may be combined with further intramuscular active agents so that an effective treatment is obtained without imposing additional manipulations to the animals. The compositions of the invention may be administered by intramuscular injection(s) using techniques and/or devices known per se in the art. In this regard, intramuscular injection can be performed with a syringe, a gun, a micro-needle injection device, a needle-free injection device, a pulse device, etc. In a preferred embodiment, injection is performed with a needle injector or a syringe. In another particular embodiment, injection is performed with a needle-free injection device such as a pulse needle-free system, more particularly a spring-powered, battery-powered, or compressed-gas-powered device. Specific examples of needle free technologies are described e.g., in WO2006/058426, WO2007/140610, or WO2009/111794. A preferred needle-free injection device for use in the present invention is AcuShot™ needle free technology described in the international patents WO2006/058426 and WO2007/140610. Intramuscular injection may be made in any muscle. For livestock, such as cattle, intramuscular injection is preferably made in the area of the neck, or behind the ear, rather than in the hind limb/ham muscle or in the inguinal fold. The results presented show that intramuscular triazines exhibit potent therapeutic effect when administered in the area of the neck. In this regard, an object of the invention resides in a composition comprising a triazine for use in the preventive treatment of coccidiosis in a non-human mammal, wherein said composition is administered by intramuscular injection in the neck or behind the ear. A further object of the invention resides in a composition comprising a triazine for use to protect a non-human mammal against coccidiosis, wherein said composition is administered by intramuscular injection in the neck or behind the ear. Another object of the invention resides in a method to protect a non-human mammal against coccidiosis, the method comprising the intramuscular injection of a composition comprising an effective amount of a triazine in the neck or behind the ear of said mammal. In a particular embodiment, the animal has not been exposed yet to the causative agent of coccidiosis and the method can be used to prevent or reduce infection. In another embodiment, the animal has already been exposed to the causative agent and the treatment is used to prevent or delay development of the disease and symptoms, or to reduce or cure the disease, or to avoid/limit disease spreading. The compositions of the invention are more preferably administered by a single intramuscular injection to the non-human mammal. The results show that a single intramuscular injection is sufficient to protect a non-human mammal against coccidiosis. As illustrated, when a single intramuscular injection of toltrazuril is made between newborn and 3 days after birth, a protective effect is obtained at day 3-5, when the first disease symptoms are expected to appear. Accordingly, in a more preferred embodiment, the intramuscular triazine of the invention is administered in newborn to 3 days old non-human mammals (e.g. piglets), even more preferably between newborn to 48 hours after birth, so as to ensure a most efficient protection than an oral administration at the same time (newborn to 3 days old). In this regard, a preferred embodiment of the invention resides in a composition comprising a triazine for use to protect a non-human mammal from coccidiosis, wherein said composition is administered by a single intramuscular injection, preferably in the neck or behind the ear. Another object of the invention resides in a method for protecting a non-human mammal against coccidiosis, the method comprising a single intramuscular injection, preferably in the neck or behind the ear, of a composition comprising an effective amount of a triazine to said mammal. The dose of triazine may vary depending on the non-human mammal species and nature of the triazine. Conventional dosage rates from 1 to 60 mg of triazine per kg bodyweight (mg/kg) of the animal may be used, preferably 5 to 50 mg/kg, and more preferably from 10 to 30 mg/kg. Illustrative dosages in the compositions of the invention are 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg, 50 mg or 60 mg toltrazuril/dose. Within the context of the invention, the term “effective amount of” designates, preferably, a dose of the active agent which produces a clinical benefit in the treated animals. Particularly, an effective amount is an amount sufficient to reduce infection, disease development, or to improve the symptoms. Preferred dosages for intramuscular toltrazuril are disclosed below, for different non-human mammal species: . pigs: 20 mg/kg bodyweight/treatment (preferably one single administration); . cattle: 15 mg/kg bodyweight/treatment (preferably one single administration); . sheep: 20 mg/kg bodyweight/treatment (preferably one single administration). In this regard, a preferred embodiment of the invention resides in a composition comprising from 1 to 60 mg toltrazuril per kg bodyweight for use in protecting a non-human mammal against coccidiosis, wherein said composition is administered by a single intramuscular injection, preferably in the neck or behind the ear. Another object of the invention resides in a method for protecting a non-human mammal against coccidiosis, the method comprising a single intramuscular injection, preferably in the neck or behind the ear, of a composition comprising from 1 to 60 mg toltrazuril per kg bodyweight to said non-human mammal. The composition may be formulated as a solution or suspension, or any form suitable for intramuscular injection. The compositions are preferably suspensions. The compositions may further comprise veterinary acceptable excipient(s) such as solvents, solubilizers, antioxidants, preservatives, thickeners, anti-foaming agents, etc. Suitable solvents include, without limitation, physiologically acceptable water, alcohols, esters, vegetable oils; and mixtures thereof, in isotonic solutions. Solubilizers include, e.g., polyvinylpyrrolidone. Examples of suitable antioxidants include ascorbic acid, gallic acid esters, and sulphitess; and suitable preservatives include, without limitation, benzyl alcohol, n-butanol, benzalkonium chloride, benzoic acid or citric acid. Anti-foaming agents include without limitation oil carrier such as mineral oil, vegetable oil, white oil or any other oil that is insoluble in the foaming medium, silicone oil, simethicone emulsion, wax and/or hydrophobic silica such as ethylene bis stearamide (EBS), paraffinic waxes, ester waxe, silica, fatty alcohol, fatty acid soaps or esters, silicone compound, polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol copolymers and alkyl polyacrylates. An example of a composition for use in the invention is a suspension comprising toltrazuril (between 10 to 30 mg toltrazuril per kg bodyweight) in water, and an anti-foaming agent. A specific example of a suspension composition for use in the invention comprises 30 mg of toltrazuril, 3 mg of docusate sodium, 100 mg of polyvinylpyrrolidone, 100 mg of ethanol and water qs for 1 ml. As indicated above, the composition may comprise further active agents, such as antibiotics, anthelmintics, endectocides, anti-inflammatory agents, vitamins, and/or mineral(s) such as iron, for single, grouped, separated or sequential intramuscular injection. Preferably, the triazine and the other agent(s) are combined in the same formulation for a single intramuscular injection. In a preferred embodiment, the other agent is or comprises iron, preferably an iron complex. In parenterally injectable preparations against iron-deficiency anemia, the most common preparations accepted today comprise a combined product of ferric oxyhydroxide (or ferric hydroxide) in association with a saccharide, notably dextran or dextrin. Additional iron preparations are known, such as iron-sucrose, iron-oligosaccharide and iron-gluconate compounds. Examples of preferred iron complexes include an aqueous colloidal solution of beta-ferric oxyhydroxide and dextran glucoheptonic acid (Gleptoferron commercialized under the trademark Gleptosil® or Ursoferran®); a ferric hydroxide with a low molecular weight dextran (commercialized under the trademark Uniferon® or Dexafer®); a ferric hydroxide with macromolecular dextran (commercialized under the trademark Ferroforte®); or a ferric compound of type I. In a further preferred embodiment, the composition of the invention is a suspension comprising a triazine and an iron complex. More particularly, a specific and preferred example of a composition of the invention is a suspension comprising: a triazine, an iron complex, and an anti-foaming agent. A more specific example is a suspension comprising toltrazuril (preferably between 10 to 60 mg), an iron complex (preferably of beta-ferric oxyhydroxide and dextran glucoheptonic acid), water, and an anti-foaming agent. In this regard, a further object of the invention resides in a composition comprising a triazine and a further active agent, for use for protecting a non-human mammal against coccidiosis, wherein said composition is administered by intramuscular injection. Preferably, both active agents are formulated together, even more preferably as a suspension. In a more preferred embodiment the two active agents are administered as a single intramuscular injection. A particular embodiment of the invention resides in a composition for use to protect non-human mammals against coccidiosis, wherein the composition comprises a triazine and an iron complex, and wherein the composition is administered by a single intramuscular injection. In a more preferred embodiment, the composition comprises 1 to 60 mg/kg bodyweight triazine and a complex of iron, preferably in suspension. Triazine—Iron Combined Injection It has been proposed in the art to combine a triazine with iron, in order to treat both coccidiosis and anemia. However, such a combination raises formulation and administration problems. Indeed, the triazine is usually administered orally, while the iron compound is typically injected. EP2164196 proposed oral compositions of both agents but, at the same time, recognizes that iron compounds administered orally exhibit low bioavailability and should be administered within 8 to 10 hours after birth, leading to a separate schedule of administration for both compounds. In addition, oral administration prevents strict control of the dosage administered to each animal. Moreover, it has been disclosed that depending on the dosage, iron compound administered by injection may cause side effects. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for an optimized triazine/iron combination treatment that is efficient and convenient. Such an optimized product would preferably contain a triazine (e.g., toltrazuril) and iron in the same formulation, suitable for combined administration, with dosages, amounts, and pharmacokinetics adapted to provide effective protection of non-human mammal such as piglets, even shortly after birth. The invention allows an optimized combined administration of a triazine with iron. The invention discloses optimal dosage schedule and administration route for both compounds, to confer best protective effect. The invention further shows that, contrary to the usual knowledge, it is not stressful for one day animals to be treated by a combined intramuscular injection of a triazine, in particular toltrazuril, and iron (as complex). The invention thus allows an efficient method for treating coccidiosis and anemia in non-human mammals, even at very early stages of growth of the animals. A particular object of the invention resides in an injectable composition comprising toltrazuril and iron (as complex), wherein said composition comprises, in a total volume of 0.5 to 2.0 ml, 100-400 mg of an iron (as complex) compound and 10-120 mg toltrazuril. Such a composition contains the amount of toltrazuril and iron (as complex) required to obtain the minimal effective dose to ensure efficient protection. Such a composition is suitable for treating animals (e.g., piglets) of 0.40 to 5 kg, with no need for dilutions. A preferred composition of the invention is a unitary dosage of 1.5 ml comprising 37.5 mg toltrazuril and 200 mg of an iron compound. As shown in the experimental section, such a product provides optimized amounts of both agents, in a suitable form for combined delivery in one single injection, with no side effect. The compositions of the invention are formulated for injection and contain suitable excipients or vehicles such as diluents, adjuvants, stabilizers, preservatives, thickeners, anti-foaming etc. Another object of the invention resides in an injectable composition as defined above for use in treating coccidiosis and anemia in a non-human mammals, wherein said composition is administered by intramuscular injection, preferably by a single intramuscular injection. Another object of the invention resides in a method for treating coccidiosis and anemia in a non-human mammal, the method comprising the intramuscular injection to said non-human mammal of a composition as defined above. The invention is particularly suited to treat young piglets, between newborn and 3 days after birth, which usually have a weight of between 0.40 to 5 kg. For treating such population, there is no need to dilute the compositions, nor to weight the animal for adjustment. The composition may comprise further active agents, such as antibiotics, anti-inflammatory agents, anthelmintics, endectocides, minerals such as iron, or vitamins, for grouped, separate or sequential injection. The invention also relates to a method for determining the optimal treatment regimen for a young non-human mammal, the method comprising: . selecting a fixed total volume (V) for the injectable composition, said volume being selected between 0.5 and 2.0 ml;. determining the volume (V1) and concentration of an iron compound source material suitable to obtain a concentration of 200 mg/ml in the final composition;. determining the concentration of a toltrazuril source material required to obtain a concentration of 20 to 50 mg/ml in the final composition when a volume V2 of such a source material is used, wherein V1+V2=V; and. optionally mixing the iron and toltrazuril compounds in one or several suitable excipients to prepare the formulation. The present invention may be used in any non-human mammals, including porcine, ovine, bovine, canine or feline and preferably livestock, breeding animals, companion animals, and laboratory animals. Livestock and breeding animals include mammals such as, for example, cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, goats, camels, water buffalos, donkeys, rabbits, fallow deer, reindeer, fur bearers such as, for example, mink, chinchilla or raccoon. Companion animals include such as, for example, horses, dogs and cats. Laboratory animals and experimental animals include such as, for example, mice, rats, guinea pigs, or golden hamsters. Particular emphasis may be placed on pigs, cattle, sheep and dogs in all species, subspecies and breeds. It may be used in adults or young animals, such as newborn to 10 days old non-human mammals. Further aspects and advantages of the invention will be disclosed in the following illustrative experimental section. Examples Example A Local and General Tolerance of a Single Intramuscular Injection of Toltrazuril in 3-Day Old Piglets Protocol This target animal safety and efficacy study was conducted in a farm with known history of cocciodiosis. The main objective was to study the safety and efficacy of intramuscular injection of toltrazuril in comparison to the standard oral application. Group 1: 8 piglets 3 days old were injected by a single intramuscular dose of toltrazuril (Dose=20 mg toltrazuril per kg bodyweight equivalent to 0.4 mL/kg bodyweight) on SD0.Group 2: 8 piglets 3 days old were injected by one intramuscular dose of toltrazuril (60 mg toltrazuril per kg bodyweight equivalent to 1.2 mL/Kg bodyweight) on SD0Group 3: 8 piglets 3 days old were dosed orally with the standard commercial formulation of toltrazuril Cevazuril® (Dose=20 mg toltrazuril per kg bodyweight equivalent to 0.4 mL/Kg bodyweight) on SD0Group 4: 12 piglets 3 days old, left untreated. All four (4) groups of piglets were injected on SD0 with iron (Gleptosil®) at the dose rate of 1 ml per piglet. Results The local and general tolerances, as well as bodyweight development were assessed. The results are presented FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 and can be summarized as follows: Intramuscular doses up to 60 mg/kg was well toleratedNo pain, limited local reaction (Oedema) in some piglets injected with 1.2 mL/Kg bodyweight, disappearing within less than 1 week post injectionThe bodyweight development was normal in treated piglets.The intramuscularly treated piglets gained more than control non treated piglets (+2 kg at SD0+29 days) Example B Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Anti-Coccidial Efficacy of Intramuscular Toltrazuril in 2 Day-Old Piglets when Applied Once Protocol Group 1: 10 piglets 2 days old were injected with once intramuscularly dose of toltrazuril C629 (Dose=20 mg toltrazuril per kg bodyweight—equivalent to 0.4 mL/Kg bodyweight) on SD0Group 2: 11 piglets 2 days old were injected with once intramuscularly dose of toltrazuril C629 (Dose=40 mg toltrazuril per kg bodyweight a—equivalent to 0.8 mL/kg bodyweight) on SD0Group 3: 9 piglets 2 days old were dosed orally with the standard commercial formulation of toltrazuril Cevazuril® (Dose=20 mg toltrazuril per kg bodyweight—equivalent to 0.4 mL/Kg bodyweight) on SD0.Group 4: 8 piglets, left untreated. All four (4) groups of piglets were injected on SD0 with iron injection (Gleptosil®) at the dose rate of 1 ml per piglet. 3 days after treatment (on SD3), the piglets were orally challenged with a characterised strain of Isospora suis. The following study parameters were used to assess the efficacy of the test products: Local and general tolerance (for Groups 1 and 2)Occurrence of diarrhoea and faecal consistencyOocyst excretionBodyweight developmentSerum concentrations of toltrazuril and its metabolite toltrazuril sulfone (e.g ponazuril) in Group 1, 2 and 3. Results The results are presented FIGS. 3 to 5 and in the following Table 1. They can be summarized as follows. All the tested doses were well toleratedNo oocyst excretion was observed in treated animals and the fecal consistency was unchanged in treated piglets (G1, G2 and G3).The animals infected and treated orally or intramuscularly (G1, G2 G3) gained more weight than the control animals (G4).Toltrazuril is well absorbed after intramuscular application.The toltrazuril sulfone (e.g ponazuril) kinetics is not statistically different in animals treated orally (G3) or intramuscularly (G1 and G2) TABLE 1 Pharmacokinetic Group 1 Group 2 Parameters (i.m. 20 mg/kg) (i.m. 40 mg/kg) Tmax (h) 157 171 Cmax (mg/L) 4025 7293 Cmax/Dose 193 182 AUCinf (mg * h/L) 854714 1362678 AUCinf/Dose 39551 34067 1-21.
