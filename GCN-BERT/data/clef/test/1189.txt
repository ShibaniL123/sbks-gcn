Example 1. 3-[4-(4-Methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]-5-phenyl-1,5-dihydro-6H-pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridin-6-one
Step 1. 6-Chloro-3-iodo-1-{[2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxy]methyl}-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridine
A mixture of 6-chloro-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridine (2.00 g, 13.0 mmol), iodine (6.61 g, 26.0 mmol) and potassium hydroxide (2.92 g, 52.1 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (30 mL) was stirred at 50° C. for 18 hours. After cooling to room temperature, water (30 mL) was added. The mixture was then extracted with ethyl acetate and the organic phase was washed with brine. The organic phase was dried over sodium sulfate and the solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure. The obtained crude product was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (50 mL) and NaH in mineral oil (833 mg, 20.8 mmol) was added at 0° C. After stirring the mixture for 5 min, 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl chloride (2.77 ml, 15.6 mmol) was added dropwise. After stirring the resulting mixture at 0° C. for 3 h, the mixture was quenched by the addition of water and the product was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with brine and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure and the obtained crude product was purified by Biotage Isolera™ (3.20 g, 60%).
