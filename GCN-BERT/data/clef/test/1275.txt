Step 3: Preparation of 4-(3-(4-(2-carbonyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridin-5-yl)piperazine-1-carbonyl)ben zyl)phthalazin-1(2H)-one
Analogous to the process for preparing Compound (1) in Step 7 in Example 1, Compound c' was condensed with Compound n to produce Compound (9): 4-(3-(4-(2-carbonyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridin-5-yl)piperazine-1-carbonyl)ben zyl)phthalazin-1(2H)-one (37 mg, yield 46%).
