DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The following detailed description is of the best currently contemplated modes of carrying out exemplary embodiments of the invention. The description is not to be taken in a limiting sense, but is made merely for the purpose of illustrating the general principles of the invention. Broadly, an embodiment of the present invention provides an exercise device that enables a user to exercise the adductor and abductor muscles. The exercise device may include a base with at least one base channel and a slant board with at least one slant board channel. The exercise device may further include at least one rolling cylinder configured to fit within the at least one base channel and the at least one slant board channel. Referring to FIGS. 1 through 12, the present invention may include an exercise machine with a base 12. The base 12 may include at least one channel. For example, the base 12 may include two channels on each outer edge. At the front of the base channel there may be at least one forward rolling cylinder stop 32. At the rear of the base channel there may be at least one rear rolling cylinder stop 34. Protruding from the rear of the base 12 may be an anchor bar 28. The anchor bar 28 may be substantially perpendicular to the base 12. An overhead handle bar 10 may be pivotally connected to the top of the anchor bar 28. At least one rolling cylinder 24 may rest within the channels. The rolling cylinder may rotate within the channels and in between the forward rolling cylinder stop 32 and the rear rolling cylinder stop 34. As illustrated in FIG. 5, the rolling cylinder 24 may include a bar with two discs on either side. However, the rolling cylinder 24 may be configured to have substantially the same circumference across the entire device. In certain embodiments, the rotating cylinder 24 may comprise multiple discs. As disclosed, the rolling cylinder 24 may be in multiple configurations to provide a similar function. The present invention may further include a slant board 20. The slant board 20 may be located above the base 12. The slant board 12 may include at least one slant board channel corresponding with the at least one base channel. The rolling cylinder 24 may rest within the channel of the slant board 20 and the corresponding channel of the base 12. In certain embodiments, a footpad 14 may be at the front end of the slant board 20. In certain embodiments, the footpad 14 may connect to the slant board 20 by a rotating hinge and thereby the footpad 14 may pivot with respect to the slant board 20. The slant board may be in a planar or a non-planar shape such as a concave/convex fashion. In certain embodiments, a seat support 38 may be connected to the exercise device. For example, as illustrated in the Figures, the seat support 38 may be connected to the rear of slant board 20. However, the seat support 38 may be in a different configuration to serve a similar purpose. For example, a flange running the length of the slant board 20 and projecting perpendicular up from the slant board 20 may connect with the seat support 38. The seat support 38 may include a seat 16 and at least one handle 18. However, the handle 18 may be located and attached directly to the slant board 20, and thereby be in front of a user. Behind the seat support 38 and attached to the slant board 20 may be a connecting bar 30. The connecting bar 30 may be adjacent to the rear rolling cylinder stop 34. The connecting bat 30 may be connected to the slant board 20 by a pivot bracket 26. In certain embodiments, the connecting bar 30 may protrude upwards. The connecting bar 30 may connect to the overhead handle bars 10 near the top by a vertical bar connection slot 44. In certain embodiments, the present invention may further include a support frame 22. The support frame 22 may support the exercise device. For example, as illustrated, the support frame 22 may connect to the base 12 and run vertically up the exercise machine. The support frame 22 may further connect to other components of the exercise machine to further provide support and stability. To use the invention, the user may sit on the seat 16 supported by the seat support 38 that rests on the slant board 20. The user may secure his feet to the foot pad 14 using the foot strap 36. When the rolling cylinder 24 is near the front of the base, resting against the forward rolling cylinder stop 32, the slant board 20 may be slanting upward, as illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2. The user may press the front of the slant board 20 with his feet. This may thereby force the rolling cylinder 24 to rotate towards the seat support 38. At this point, the slant board 20 may be slanting downwards, as illustrated in FIG. 3. Once pushed all the way, the rolling cylinder 24 may be pressed against the rear rolling cylinder stop 34. In certain embodiments, the user may lift the front of the slant board 20 using the foot straps 36. The user may lift the slant board 20 when the rolling cylinder is pressed against the rear rolling cylinder stop 34. The momentum produced by the user's body weight and foot motion may force the cylinder to roll back to the front of the machine, and up to the forward rolling cylinder stop 32. Again, in this position, the slant board 20 may be slanting upward. The overhead handle bar 10 may also be used as a mechanism to move the rolling cylinder 24 from the forward rolling cylinder stop 32 to the rear rolling cylinder stop 34 and vice versa. For example, the overhead handle bar 10 may be pushed upward, thereby lifting the rear of the slant board 20 and positioning the slant board 20 towards the downward slanting position. Further, the overhead handle bar 10 may pulled downward, pushing the rear of the slant board 20 and positioning the slant board 20 towards the upward slanting position. As illustrated in FIGS. 13 and 14, the present invention may further include a plurality of rollers 40 and a cord 42. The plurality of rollers 40 may be mounted on the base 12. A roller 40 may further be mounted onto the rolling cylinder 24. The rollers 40 may act as a track for the cord 42 to run along. In such embodiments, the cord 42 and rollers 40 may be used to aid in moving the rolling cylinder 24 back and forth along the channels It should be understood, of course, that the foregoing relates to exemplary embodiments of the invention and that modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims. 1.
