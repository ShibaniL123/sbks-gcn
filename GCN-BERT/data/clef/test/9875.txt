FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to substituted pyrazolospiroketone compounds that act as inhibitors of an acetyl-CoA carboxylase(s) and their use in treating diseases, conditions or disorders modulated by the inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme(s). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Acetyl-CoA carboxylases (ACC) are a family of enzymes found in most species and are associated with fatty acid synthesis and metabolism through catalyzing the production of malonyl-CoA from acetyl-CoA. In mammals, two isoforms of the ACC enzyme have been identified. ACC1, which is expressed at high levels in lipogenic tissues, such as fat and the liver, controls the first committed step in the biosynthesis of long-chain fatty acids. If acetyl-CoA is not carboxylated to form malonyl-CoA, it is metabolized through the Krebs cycle. ACC2, a minor component of hepatic ACC but the predominant isoform in heart and skeletal muscle, catalyzes the production of malonyl-CoA at the cytosolic surface of mitochondria, and regulates how much fatty acid is utilized in β-oxidation by inhibiting carnitine palmitoyl transferase. Thus, by increasing fatty acid utilization and by preventing increases in de novo fatty acid synthesis, chronic administration of an ACC inhibitor (ACC-1) may also deplete liver and adipose tissue triglyceride (TG) stores in obese subjects consuming a high or low-fat diet, leading to selective loss of body fat. Studies conducted by Abu-Etheiga, et al., suggest that ACC2 plays an essential role in controlling fatty acid oxidation and, as such it would provide a target in therapy against obesity and obesity-related diseases, such as type-2 diabetes. See, Abu-Etheiga, L., et al., “Acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 mutant mice are protected against obesity and diabetes induced by high-fat/high-carbohydrate diets” PNAS, 100(18) 10207-10212 (2003). See also, Choi, C. S., et al., “Continuous fat oxidation in acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 knockout mice increases total energy expenditure, reduces fat mass, and improves insulin sensitivity” PNAS, 104(42) 16480-16485 (2007). It is becoming increasingly clear that hepatic lipid accumulation causes hepatic insulin resistance and contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Salvage, et al., demonstrated that ACC 1 and ACC2 are both involved in regulating fat oxidation in hepatocytes while ACC1, the dominant isoform in rat liver, is the sole regulator of fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, in their model, combined reduction of both isoforms is required to significantly lower hepatic malonyl-CoA levels, increase fat oxidation in the fed state, reduce lipid accumulation, and improve insulin action in vivo. Thus, showing that hepatic ACC1 and ACC2 inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatic insulin resistance. See, Savage, D. B., et al., “Reversal of diet-induced hepatic steatosis and hepatic insulin resistance by antisense oligonucleotide inhibitors of acetyl-CoA carboxylases 1 and 2” J Clin Invest doi: 10.1172/JCI27300. See also, Oh, W., et al., “Glucose and fat metabolism in adipose tissue of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2 knockout mice” PNAS, 102(5) 1384-1389 (2005). Consequently, there is a need for medicaments containing ACC1 and/or ACC2 inhibitors to treat obesity and obesity-related diseases (such as, NAFLD and type-2 diabetes) by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis and by increasing fatty acid oxidation.

The starting materials are generally available from commercial sources such as Aldrich Chemicals (Milwaukee, Wis.) or are readily prepared using methods well known to those skilled in the art (e.g., prepared by methods generally described in Louis F. Fieser and Mary Fieser, Reagents for Organic Synthesis, v. 1-19, Wiley, New York (1967-1999 ed.), or Beilsteins Handbuch der organischen Chemie, 4, Aufl. ed. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, including supplements (also available via the Beilstein online database)). For illustrative purposes, the reaction schemes depicted below provide potential routes for synthesizing the compounds of the present invention as well as key intermediates. For a more detailed description of the individual reaction steps, see the Examples section below. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other synthetic routes may be used to synthesize the inventive compounds. Although specific starting materials and reagents are depicted in the schemes and discussed below, other starting materials and reagents can be easily substituted to provide a variety of derivatives and/or reaction conditions. In addition, many of the compounds prepared by the methods described below can be further modified in light of this disclosure using conventional chemistry well known to those skilled in the art. In the preparation of compounds of the present invention, protection of remote functionality (e.g., primary or secondary amine) of intermediates may be necessary. The need for such protection will vary depending on the nature of the remote functionality and the conditions of the preparation methods. Suitable amino-protecting groups (NH-Pg) include acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, t-butoxycarbonyl (BOC), benzyloxycarbonyl (CBz) and 9-fluorenylmethyleneoxycarbonyl (Fmoc). Similarly, a “hydroxy-protecting group” refers to a substituent of a hydroxy group that blocks or protects the hydroxy functionality. Suitable hydroxyl-protecting groups (O-Pg) include for example, allyl, acetyl, silyl, benzyl, para-methoxybenzyl, trityl, and the like. The need for such protection is readily determined by one skilled in the art. For a general description of protecting groups and their use, see T. W. Greene, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1991. The following reaction schemes, Reaction Scheme I through Reaction Scheme IV provide representative procedures that are used to prepare the compounds of Formula (I). It is to be understood that these reaction schemes are to be construed in a non-limiting manner and that reasonable variations of the depicted methods can be used to prepare the compounds of Formula (I). Reaction Scheme I outlines the general procedures one could use to provide compounds of the present invention having Formula (Ia) which are compounds of Formula (I) in which R2 and each R3 are each hydrogen. The protected spiropiperidine derivative (VIIIa) may be formed by treating the appropriately protected piperidine aldehyde (Xa) with methyl vinyl ketone (IXa). The group Pg represents an appropriate amine protecting group and is preferably N-tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC) or carbobenzyloxy (Cbz). This reaction can be carried out in the presence of ethanolic potassium hydroxide according to a procedure analogous to that described by Roy, S. et al., Chem. Eur. J. 2006, 12, 3777-3788 at 3786. Alternatively, the reaction can be carried out in the presence of para-toluenesulfonic acid (pTSA) in refluxing benzene to provide the desired product (VIIIa). The spiropiperidine derivative (VIIIa) can then be reacted with tris-(N,N-dimethylamino)methane in refluxing toluene to provide the enamine functionalized spiropiperidine derivative (VIIa). Alternatively, the enamine (VIIa) may be prepared by reacting spiropiperidine (VIIIa) with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal as solvent at reflux. This reaction may also be run in an alcoholic solvent such as 2-propanol, an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene or a polar aprotic solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide. Additionally, this reaction may be catalyzed by the addition of 4-toluenesulfonic acid, tris(dimethylamino)methane, or various bases such as lithium hydroxide, DBU and N,N-diisopropylethylamine. This transformation may also be performed with, or by reaction with, t-butoxy bis(dimethylamino)methane in toluene at reflux. Compound (VIIa) is then reacted with an appropriate hydrazine derivative R1NHNH2 in the presence of acetic acid in refluxing ethanol or toluene to provide the desired cyclized compound of formula (VIa) (see Murali Dhar, T. G. et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2007, 17, 5019-5024 at 5020). The compound of formula (VIa) can then be treated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of water in THF to provide the corresponding bromo hydroxy derivative of formula (Va). The bromo hydroxy derivative (Va) is then oxidized with Jones reagent in a method analogous to that provided in Wolinsky, J. et al., J. Org. Chem. 1978, 43(5), 875-881 at 876, 879 to provide the α-bromo keto derivative of formula (IVa). Alternatively the oxidation of (Va) can be performed with catalytic tetrapropylammonium perruthenate and N-methylmorpholine N-oxide. The compound of formula (IVa) can then be debrominated using conventional methods such as treatment with zinc and acetic acid or, alternatively, zinc in the presence of aqueous ammonium chloride in tetrahydrofuran to provide the compound of formula (IIIa). The compound of formula (IIIa) can then be deprotected to provide the free spiropiperidine derivative of formula (IIa) using standard methods which depend on which protecting group Pg has been employed. For example, when Pg represents tert-butyloxycarbonyl (BOC) standard strong acid deprotection conditions such as 4N hydrochloric acid in dioxane or trifluoroacetic acid in an appropriate solvent such as dichloromethane can be used to remove the BOC group. When Pg represents carbobenzyloxy (Cbz), hydrogenation over palladium on carbon in ethanol or treatment with a hydrogen source such as ammonium formate or 1-methyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene in the presence of palladium on carbon in ethanol or ethyl acetate can be employed to carry out the deprotection. The spiropiperidine derivative of Formula (IIa) can then be acylated by employing standard methods to provide the compound of Formula (Ia). For example, the compound (Ia) may then be formed using a standard peptide coupling reaction with the desired carboxylic acid (R4CO2H). For example, the spiropiperidine intermediate (IIa) and carboxylic acid (R4CO2H) may be coupled by forming an activated carboxylic acid ester, such as by contacting the carboxylic acid (R4CO2H) with a peptide coupling reagent, such as O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) or 1-ethyl-(3-dimethyllaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC.HCl), in the presence or absence of an activating agent, such as hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) and in the presence of a suitable base, such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA), triethylamine or N-methylmorpholine (NMM), in a suitable solvent such as THF and/or DMF, dimethylacetamide (DMA) or dichloromethane and then contacting the activated carboxylic acid ester with the spiropiperidine derivative (IIa) to form a compound of Formula (Ia). Alternatively, compounds of Formula (Ia) can be formed by first converting the carboxylic acid (R4CO2H) to an acid chloride (R4COCl), such as by reacting with thionyl chloride, and then reacting the acid chloride with the spiropiperidine derivative (IIa) in the presence of an appropriate base such as triethylamine in an appropriate solvent such as dichloromethane to form a compound of Formula (Ia). Still another alternative method entails treating the carboxylic acid (R4CO2H) with 2-chloro-4,6-dimethoxytriazine in the presence of a suitable base, such as N-methylmorpholine in a suitable solvent such as THF and/or DMF. To the activated ester is added a solution of the spiropiperidine derivative (IIa) and base, such as N-methylmorpholine, in a suitable solvent, such as THF and/or DMF which then provides the compound of Formula (Ia). Reaction Scheme II provides an alternative synthesis of compounds of Formula (Ia) starting from the intermediate of Formula (VIa). The compound of Formula (VIa) is treated with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in the presence of methanol in THF, or preferably in methanol, (Nishimura, T. et al. Org. Lett. 2008, 10(18), 4057-4060 at 4059) to provide the methoxy bromo spiropiperidine derivative of Formula (Vb). Base induced elimination of the compound of Formula (Vb) by treatment with a strong base such as potassium tert-butoxide in THF provides the compound of Formula (IVb) which is then treated with a strong acid such as 2N hydrochloric acid in THF to provide the compound of Formula (IIIa). The compound of Formula (IIIa) can then be deprotected and acylated as described previously in Reaction Scheme I to provide compounds of Formula (Ia). Reaction Scheme III provides a synthesis of compounds of Formula (Ib) which are compounds of Formula (I) in which R2 is bromo and each R3 is hydrogen. The compound of Formula (VIa) is reacted with approximately two equivalents of N-bromosuccinimide in the presence of methanol to provide the dibromo methoxy spiropiperidine derivative of Formula (Vc). The compound of Formula (Vc) is then subjected to elimination conditions by treatment with a strong base such as potassium tert-butoxide in an appropriate solvent to provide the compound of Formula (IVc). Treatment of the compound of formula (IVc) with strong acid such as 2N hydrochloric acid provides the compound of Formula (IIIb). Deprotection of the compound of Formula (IIIb) to provide the compound of Formula (IIb) followed by acylation to provide the compound of Formula (Ib) can be carried out as described previously for Reaction Scheme I. Reaction Scheme IV depicts the preparation of certain other compounds within Formula (I) from certain of the intermediates previously depicted. The first transformation in Reaction Scheme IV shows introduction of a methyl group at the R2 position by reacting the bromo spiropiperidine derivative of Formula (IIIb) with trimethylboroxine in dimethylformamide in the presence of an appropriate palladium catalyst, such as palladium tetrakis triphenylphosphine in the presence of potassium carbonate and water to provide the compound of Formula (IIIc). Other alkyl groups can be introduced at the R2 position in an analogous manner. The compound of Formula (IIIc) can then be deprotected and acylated as previously described. The second transformation in Reaction Scheme IV depicts the introduction of a cyano group at the R2 position. The bromo spiropiperidine compound (IIIb) is reacted with zinc cyanide in the presence of zinc and an appropriate palladium catalyst to provide the compound of Formula (IIId) which can then be deprotected and acylated to provide a compound of Formula (Id). The third transformation in Reaction Scheme IV depicts introduction of an appropriate group at the R3 position of the compound of Formula (IIIe). The compound of Formula (IIIe) is deprotonated with a strong base, such as lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LHMDS) under appropriate anhydrous conditions in an appropriate solvent, preferably at low temperature. The enolate thus formed is then reacted with an appropriate electrophile R3Lg wherein Lg represents an appropriate leaving group (such as a halide when R3Lg is an alkyl halide) to provide the compound of Formula (IIIf) wherein R3 is an appropriate group such as an alkyl group. The deprotonation of the compound of Formula (IIIf) and reaction with another R3Lg can then be carried out again if desired. The compound of Formula (IIIf) can then be deprotected and acylated as previously described to provide the compound of Formula (Ie). The compounds of the present invention may be isolated and used per se or in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. In accordance with the present invention, compounds with multiple basic nitrogen atoms can form salts with varying number of equivalents (“eq.”) of acid. It will be understood by practitioners that all such salts are within the scope of the present invention. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts, as used herein in relation to compounds of the present invention, include pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic salts of the compound. These salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of a compound, or by separately reacting the compound thereof, with a suitable organic or inorganic acid and isolating the salt thus formed. Representative salts include, but are not limited to, the hydrobromide, hydrochloride, hydroiodide, sulfate, bisulfate, nitrate, acetate, trifluoroacetate, oxalate, besylate, palmitate, pamoate, malonate, stearate, laurate, malate, borate, benzoate, lactate, phosphate, hexafluorophosphate, benzene sulfonate, tosylate, formate, citrate, maleate, fumarate, succinate, tartrate, naphthylate, mesylate, glucoheptonate, lactobionate and laurylsulphonate salts, and the like. These may also include cations based on the alkali and alkaline earth metals, such as sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like, as well as non-toxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations including, but not limited to, ammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylammonium, dimethylammonium, trimethylammonium, triethylammonium, ethylammonium, and the like. For additional examples see, for example, Berge, et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 66, 1-19 (1977). Compounds of the present invention may exist in more than one crystal form. Polymorphs of compounds of Formula (I) and salts thereof (including solvates and hydrates) form part of this invention and may be prepared by crystallization of a compound of the present invention under different conditions. For example, using different solvents or different solvent mixtures for recrystallization; crystallization at different temperatures; various modes of cooling, ranging from very fast to very slow cooling during crystallization. Polymorphs may also be obtained by heating or melting a compound of the present invention followed by gradual or fast cooling. The presence of polymorphs may be determined by solid probe nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction or such other techniques. This invention also includes isotopically-labeled compounds, which are identical to those described by Formula (1), but for the fact that one or more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur and fluorine, such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O, 17O, 35S, 36Cl, 125I, 129I, and 18F respectively. Certain isotopically-labeled compounds of the present invention, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays. Tritiated (i.e., 3H), and carbon-14 (i.e., 14C), isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium (i.e., 2H), can afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and, hence, may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopically labeled compounds of the present invention can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the schemes and/or in the Examples below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. The compounds of the present invention may contain stereogenic centers. These compounds may exist as mixtures of enantiomers or as pure enantiomers. When the compound includes a stereogenic center, the compound may be resolved into the pure enantiomers by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example by formation of diastereoisomeric salts which may be separated, for example, by crystallization; formation of stereoisomeric derivatives or complexes which may be separated, for example, by crystallization, gas-liquid or liquid chromatography; selective reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer-specific reagent, for example enzymatic esterification; or gas-liquid or liquid chromatography in a chiral environment, for example on a chiral support for example silica with a bound chiral ligand or in the presence of a chiral solvent. It will be appreciated that where the desired stereoisomer is converted into another chemical entity by one of the separation procedures described above, a further step is required to liberate the desired enantiomeric form. Alternatively, the specific stereoisomers may be synthesized by using an optically active starting material, by asymmetric synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents, or by converting one stereoisomer into the other by asymmetric transformation. Compounds of the present invention may exist in different stable conformational forms which may be separable. Torsional asymmetry due to restricted rotation about an asymmetric single bond, for example because of steric hindrance or ring strain, may permit separation of different conformers. The compounds of the present invention further include each conformational isomer of compounds of Formula (I) and mixtures thereof. Compounds of the present invention are useful for treating diseases, conditions and/or disorders modulated by the inhibition of the acetyl-CoA carboxylases enzyme(s) (in particular, ACC1 and ACC2). Another embodiment of the present invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent or carrier. The compounds of the present invention (including the compositions and processes used therein) may also be used in the manufacture of a medicament for the therapeutic applications described herein. A typical formulation is prepared by mixing a compound of the present invention and a carrier, diluent or excipient. Suitable carriers, diluents and excipients are well known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as carbohydrates, waxes, water soluble and/or swellable polymers, hydrophilic or hydrophobic materials, gelatin, oils, solvents, water, and the like. The particular carrier, diluent or excipient used will depend upon the means and purpose for which the compound of the present invention is being applied. Solvents are generally selected based on solvents recognized by persons skilled in the art as safe (GRAS) to be administered to a mammal. In general, safe solvents are non-toxic aqueous solvents such as water and other non-toxic solvents that are soluble or miscible in water. Suitable aqueous solvents include water, ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycols (e.g., PEG400, PEG300), etc. and mixtures thereof. The formulations may also include one or more buffers, stabilizing agents, surfactants, wetting agents, lubricating agents, emulsifiers, suspending agents, preservatives, antioxidants, opaquing agents, glidants, processing aids, colorants, sweeteners, perfuming agents, flavoring agents and other known additives to provide an elegant presentation of the drug (i.e., a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof or a pharmaceutical composition thereof) or aid in the manufacturing of the pharmaceutical product (i.e., for use in medicine such as preparing a medicament). The formulations may be prepared using conventional dissolution and mixing procedures. For example, the bulk drug substance (i.e., compound of the present invention or stabilized form of the compound (e.g., complex with a cyclodextrin derivative or other known complexation agent)) is dissolved in a suitable solvent in the presence of one or more of the excipients described above. The dissolution rate of poorly water-soluble compounds may be enhanced by the use of a spray-dried dispersion, such as those described by Takeuchi, H., et al. in “Enhancement of the dissolution rate of a poorly water-soluble drug (tolbutamide) by a spray-drying solvent deposition method and disintegrants” J. Pharm. Pharmacol., 39, 769-773 (1987); and EP0901786 B1 (US2002/009494), incorporated herein by reference. The compound of the present invention is typically formulated into pharmaceutical dosage forms to provide an easily controllable dosage of the drug and to give the patient an elegant and easily handleable product. The pharmaceutical compositions also include solvates and hydrates of the compounds of the present invention. The term “solvate” refers to a molecular complex of a compound represented by Formula (I) (including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof) with one or more solvent molecules. Such solvent molecules are those commonly used in the pharmaceutical art, which are known to be innocuous to the recipient, e.g., water, ethanol, ethylene glycol, and the like, The term “hydrate” refers to the complex where the solvent molecule is water. The solvates and/or hydrates preferably exist in crystalline form. Other solvents may be used as intermediate solvates in the preparation of more desirable solvates, such as methanol, methyl t-butyl ether, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate, (S)-propylene glycol, (R)-propylene glycol, 1,4-butyne-diol, and the like. The pharmaceutical composition (or formulation) for application may be packaged in a variety of ways depending upon the method used for administering the drug. Generally, an article for distribution includes a container having deposited therein the pharmaceutical formulation in an appropriate form. Suitable containers are well-known to those skilled in the art and include materials such as bottles (plastic and glass), sachets, ampoules, plastic bags, metal cylinders, and the like. The container may also include a tamper-proof assemblage to prevent indiscreet access to the contents of the package. In addition, the container has deposited thereon a label that describes the contents of the container. The label may also include appropriate warnings. The present invention further provides a method of treating diseases, conditions and/or disorders modulated by the inhibition of the acetyl-CoA carboxylases enzyme(s) in an animal that includes administering to an animal in need of such treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, diluent, or carrier. The method is particularly useful for treating diseases, conditions and/or disorders that benefit from the inhibition of acetyl-CoA carboxylases enzyme(s). One aspect of the present invention is the treatment of obesity, and obesity-related disorders (e.g., overweight, weight gain, or weight maintenance). Obesity and overweight are generally defined by body mass index (BMI), which is correlated with total body fat and estimates the relative risk of disease. BMI is calculated by weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2). Overweight is typically defined as a BMI of 25-29.9 kg/m2, and obesity is typically defined as a BMI of 30 kg/m2. See, e.g., National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Clinical Guidelines on the Identification, Evaluation, and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in Adults, The Evidence Report, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH publication no. 98-4083 (1998). Another aspect of the present invention is for the treatment or delaying the progression or onset of diabetes or diabetes-related disorders including Type 1 (insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, also referred to as “IDDM”) and Type 2 (noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, also referred to as “NIDDM”) diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and diabetic complications (such as atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, nephropathy, hypertension, neuropathy, and retinopathy). In yet another aspect of the present invention is the treatment of obesity co-morbidities, such as metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome includes diseases, conditions or disorders such as dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, diabetes (e.g., Type 2 diabetes), coronary artery disease and heart failure. For more detailed information on Metabolic Syndrome, see, e.g., Zimmet, P. Z., et al., “The Metabolic Syndrome: Perhaps an Etiologic Mystery but Far From a Myth—Where Does the International Diabetes Federation Stand?,” Diabetes & Endocrinology, 7(2), (2005); and Alberti, K. G., et al., “The Metabolic Syndrome—A New Worldwide Definition,” Lancet, 366, 1059-62 (2005). Preferably, administration of the compounds of the present invention provides a statistically significant (p<0.05) reduction in at least one cardiovascular disease risk factor, such as lowering of plasma leptin, C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or cholesterol, as compared to a vehicle control containing no drug. The administration of compounds of the present invention may also provide a statistically significant (p<0.05) reduction in glucose serum levels. In yet another aspect of the invention is the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatic insulin resistance. For a normal adult human having a body weight of about 100 kg, a dosage in the range of from about 0.001 mg to about 10 mg per kilogram body weight is typically sufficient, preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 5.0 mg/kg, more preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 1 mg/kg. However, some variability in the general dosage range may be required depending upon the age and weight of the subject being treated, the intended route of administration, the particular compound being administered and the like. The determination of dosage ranges and optimal dosages for a particular patient is well within the ability of one of ordinary skill in the art having the benefit of the instant disclosure. It is also noted that the compounds of the present invention can be used in sustained release, controlled release, and delayed release formulations, which forms are also well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. The compounds of the present invention may also be used in conjunction with other pharmaceutical agent(s) for the treatment of the diseases, conditions and/or disorders described herein.

The reaction solution was stirred at ambient temperature for 16 hours. The solution was concentrated in vacuo and the residue was taken up in dichloromethane and concentrated (×2) under reduced pressure. To the resulting acid chloride was added tetrahydrofuran (500 mL), Preparation I-1A-1e (25.9 g) and triethylamine (71.2 mL). The solution was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. To the reaction was added saturated, aqueous sodium bicarbonate (250 mL) and the solution was stirred for 5 min. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with 1:1 ethyl acetate/tetrahydrofuran.

Such assays also provide a means whereby the activities of the compound of the present invention can be compared with the activities of other known compounds. Direct Inhibition of the Activities of ACC1 and ACC2 The ACC inhibitory activity of the compound of the present invention was demonstrated by methods based on standard procedures. For example direct inhibition of ACC activity, for the compound of Formula (1) was determined using preparations of recombinant human ACC1 (rhACC1) and recombinant human ACC2 (rhACC2). Representative sequences of the recombinant human ACC1 and ACC2 that can be used in the assay are provided in FIG. 1 (SEQ ID NO. 1) and FIG. 2 (SEQ. ID NO. 2), respectively. [1] Preparation of rhACC1. Two liters of SF9 cells, infected with recombinant baculovirus containing full length human ACC1 cDNA, were suspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 10% glycerol; 5 mM imidazole (EMD Bioscience; Gibbstown, N.J.); 2 mM TCEP (BioVectra; Charlottetown, Canada); Benzonase nuclease (10000 U/100 g cell paste; Novagen; Madison, Wis.); EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail (1 tab/50 mL; Roche Diagnostics; Mannheim, Germany). Cells were lysed by 3 cycles of freeze-thaw and centrifuged at 40,000×g for 40 minutes (4° C.). Supernatant was directly loaded onto a HisTrap FF crude column (GE Healthcare; Piscataway, N.J.) and eluted with an imidazole gradient up to 0.5 M over 20 column volumes (CV). ACC1-containing fractions were pooled and diluted 1:5 with 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM TCEP, 10% glycerol and direct loaded onto a CaptoQ (GE Healthcare) column and eluted with an NaCl gradient up to 1 M over 20 CV's. Phosphate groups were removed from purified ACC1 by incubation with lambda phosphatase (100 U/10 μM target protein; New England Biolabs; Beverly, Mass.) for 14 hours at 4° C.; okadaic acid was added (1 μM final concentration; Roche Diagnostics) to inhibit the phosphatase. Purified ACC1 was exchanged into 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mM TCEP, 10% glycerol, 0.5 M NaCl by 6 hour dialysis at 4° C. Aliquots were prepared and frozen at −80° C. [2] Measurement of rhACC1 inhibition. hACC1 was assayed in a Costar #3676 (Costar, Cambridge, Mass.) 384-well plate using the Transcreener ADP detection FP assay kit (Bellbrook Labs, Madison, Wis.) using the manufacturer's recommended conditions for a 50 μM ATP reaction. The final conditions for the assay were 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2, 7.5 mM tripotassium citrate, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 30 μM acetyl-CoA, 50 μM ATP, and 10 mM KHCO3 Typically, a 10 μl reaction was run for 120 min at 25° C., and 10 μl of Transcreener stop and detect buffer was added and the combination incubated at room temp for an additional 1 hour. The data was acquired on a Envision Fluorescence reader (Perkinelmer) using a 620 excitation Cy5 FP general dual mirror, 620 excitation Cy5 FP filter, 688 emission (S) and a 688 (P) emission filter. [3] Preparation of rhACC2. Human ACC2 inhibition was measured using purified recombinant human ACC2 (hrACC2). Briefly, a full length Cytomax clone of ACC2 was purchased from Cambridge Bioscience Limited and was sequenced and subcloned into PcDNA5 FRT TO-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The ACC2 was expressed in CHO cells by tetracycline induction and harvested in 5 liters of DMEM/F12 with glutamine, biotin, hygromycin and blasticidin with 1 μg/mL tetracycline (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.). The conditioned medium containing ACC2 was then applied to a Softlink Soft Release Avidin column (Promega, Madison, Wis.) and eluted with 5 mM biotin. 4 mgs of ACC2 were eluted at a concentration of 0.05 mg/mL (determined by A280) with an estimated purity of 95% (determined by A280). The purified ACC2 was dialyzed in 50 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 4 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, and 5% glycerol. The pooled protein was frozen and stored at −80° C., with no loss of activity upon thawing. For measurement of ACC2 activity and assessment of ACC2 inhibition, test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and added to the rhACC2 enzyme as a 5× stock with a final DMSO concentration of 1%.

Measurement of malonyl-CoA production inhibition in experimental animals. In this method, male Sprague-Dawley Rats, maintained on standard chow and water ad libitum (225-275 g), were randomized prior to the study. Animals were either fed, or fasted for 18 hours prior to the beginning of the experiment. Two hours into the light cycle the animals were orally dosed with a volume of 5 mL/kg, (0.5% methyl cellulose; vehicle) or with the appropriate compound (prepared in vehicle). Fed vehicle controls were included to determine baseline tissue malonyl-CoA levels while fasted animals were included to determine the effect fasting had on malonyl-CoA levels. One hour after compound administration the animals were asphyxiated with CO2 and the tissues were removed. Specifically, blood was collected by cardiac puncture and placed into BD Microtainer tubes containing EDTA (BD Biosciences, NJ), mixed, and placed on ice. Plasma was used to determine drug exposure. Liver and quadriceps were removed, immediately freeze-clamped, wrapped in foil and stored in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were pulverized under liquid N2 to ensure uniformity in sampling. Malonyl-CoA was extracted from the tissue (150-200 mg) with 5 volumes 10% tricarboxylic acid in Lysing Matrix A (MP Biomedicals, PN 6910) in a FastPrep FP120 (Thermo Scientific, speed=5.5; for 45 seconds). The supernatant containing malonyl-CoA was removed from the cell debris after centrifugation at 15000×g for 30 minutes (Eppendorf Centrifuge 5402). Samples were stably frozen at −80C until analysis is completed. Analysis of malonyl CoA levels in liver and muscle tissue can be evaluated using the following methodology. The method utilizes the following materials: Malonyl-CoA tetralithium salt and malonyl-13C3-CoA trilithium salt which were purchased from Isotec (Miamisburg, Ohio, USA), sodium perchlorate (Sigma, cat no. 410241), trichloroacetic acid (ACROS, cat no. 42145), phosphoric acid (J. T. Baker, cat no. 0260-01), ammonium formate (Fluka, cat no. 17843), methanol (HPLC grade, J. T. Baker, cat no. 9093-33), and water (HPLC grade, J. T. Baker, 4218-03) were used to make the necessary mobile phases. Strata-X on-line solid phase extraction columns, 25 μm, 20 mm×2.0 mm I.D (cat no. 00M-S033-B0-CB) were obtained from Phenomenex (Torrance, Calif., USA). SunFire C18 reversed-phase columns, 3.5 μm, 100 mm×3.0 mm I.D. (cat no.186002543) were purchased from Waters Corporation (Milford, Mass., USA). This method may be performed utilizing the following equipment. Two-dimensional chromatography using an Agilent 1100 binary pump, an Agilent 1100 quaternary pump and two Valco Cheminert 6-port two position valves. Samples were introduced via a LEAP HTC PAL auto sampler with Peltier cooled stack maintained at 10° C. and a 20 μL sampling loop. The needle wash solutions for the autosampler are 10% trichloroacetic acid in water (w/v) for Wash 1 and 90:10 methanol:water for Wash 2. The analytical column (Sunfire) was maintained at 35° C. using a MicroTech Scientific Micro-LC Column Oven. The eluent was analyzed on an ABI Sciex API3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with Turbo Ion Spray. Two-dimensional chromatography was performed in parallel using distinct gradient elution conditions for on-line solid phase extraction and reversed-phase chromatography. The general design of the method was such that the first dimension was utilized for sample clean-up and capture of the analyte of interest followed by a brief coupling of both dimensions for elution from the first dimension onto the second dimension. The dimensions were subsequently uncoupled allowing for gradient elution of the analyte from the second dimension for quantification while simultaneously preparing the first dimension for the next sample in the sequence. When both dimensions were briefly coupled together, the flow of the mobile phase in the first dimension was reversed for analyte elution on to the second dimension, allowing for optimal peak width, peak shape, and elution time. The first dimension of the HPLC system utilized the Phenomenex strata-X on-line solid phase extraction column and the mobile phase consisted of 100 mM sodium perchlorate/0.1% (v/v) phosphoric acid for solvent A and methanol for solvent B. The second dimension of the HPLC system utilized the Waters SunFire C18 reversed-phase column and the mobile phase consisted of 100 mM ammonium formate for solvent A and methanol for solvent B. The initial condition of the gradient was maintained for 2 minutes and during this time the analyte was transferred to the analytical column. It was important that the initial condition was at a sufficient strength to elute the analyte from the on-line SPE column while retaining it on the analytical. Afterwards, the gradient rose linearly to 74.5% A in 4.5 minutes before a wash and re-equilibration step. Mass spectrometry when coupled with HPLC can be a highly selective and sensitive method for quantitatively measuring analytes in complex matrices but is still subject to interferences and suppression. By coupling a two dimensional HPLC to the mass spectrometer, these interferences were significantly reduced. Additionally, by utilizing the Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) feature of the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer, the signal-to-noise ratio was significantly improved. For this assay, the mass spectrometer was operated in positive ion mode with a TurbolonSpray voltage of 2250V. The nebulizing gas was heated to 450° C. The Declustering Potential (DP), Focusing Potential (FP), and Collision Energy (CE) were set to 60, 340, and 42 V, respectively. Quadrupole 1 (Q1) resolution was set to unit resolution with Quadrupole 3 (Q3) set to low. The CAD gas was set to 8. The MRM transitions monitored were for malonyl CoA: 854.1→347.0 m/z (L. Gao et al. (2007) J. Chromatogr. B 853, 303-313); and for malonyl-13C3-CoA: 857.1→350.0 m/z with dwell times of 200 ms. The eluent was diverted to the mass spectrometer near the expected elution time for the analyte, otherwise it was diverted to waste to help preserve the source and improve robustness of the instrumentation. The resulting chromatograms were integrated using Analyst software (Applied Biosystems). Tissue concentrations for malonyl CoA were calculated from a standard curve prepared in a 10% solution of trichloroacetic acid in water. Samples comprising the standard curve for the quantification of malonyl-CoA in tissue extracts were prepared in 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and ranged from 0.01 to 1 pmol/μL. Malonyl-13C3-CoA (final concentration of 0.4 pmol/μL) was added to each standard curve component and sample as an internal standard. Six intra-assay quality controls were prepared; three from a pooled extract prepared from fasted animals and three from a pool made from fed animals. These were run as independent samples spiked with 0, 0.1 or 0.3 pmol/μL 12C-malonyl-CoA as well as malonyl-13C3-CoA (0.4 pmol/μL). Each intra-assay quality control contained 85% of aqueous tissue extract with the remaining portion contributed by internal standard (0.4 pmol/μL) and 12C-malonyl-CoA. Inter assay controls were included in each run; they consist of one fasted and one fed pooled sample of quadriceps and/or one fasted and one fed pooled sample of liver. All such controls are spiked with malonyl-13C3-CoA (0.4 pmol/μL). 1. A compound of structure or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. 2. A compound of structure 3.
