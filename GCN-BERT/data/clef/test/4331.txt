The invention relates to a carrier for syringes. In the case of prefilled syringes, the nozzle serving for connecting to the injection needle, i.e., in most cases of the Luer-Lock type or Luer-Slip type, is usually closed for storing and transporting with a plug or the like so as to ensure sterility of the content and to prevent leakages. However, it was found that in certain situations, e.g., due to pressure differences during the air transport, displacements of the plunger can occur, which are disadvantageous in a number of respects. This concerns primarily also the sterility of the content because the region on the back of the plunger is not sterile. Thus, when a plunger moves due to changes in ambient pressure, the sterility of the syringe content can be at risk, even if the plunger is at the same position again after a movement. It is an object of the invention to prevent accidental plunger movements in prefilled syringes during storage and transport. This is achieved according to the invention by a transport carrier with the characterizing features of the claim 1. A preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention is described hereinafter with reference of the accompanying drawings. In the figures: FIG. 1 shows a perspective illustration of a carrier with an inserted syringe, FIG. 2 shows a top view of the carrier with an inserted syringe, FIG. 3 shows a perspective illustration of the carrier with all contours extending in its interior. The carrier 1 shown in the Figures has the outer shape of an elongated cuboidal body 2 with two closed sidewalls 3 opposing each other, a likewise closed front side, hereinafter designated as plunger-side front side 4, a second front side, hereinafter designated as needle-side front side 5, a lower side 6 and an upper side 7. From the upper side, a chamber 8 extends into the interior of the body. The chamber comprises a center region 9 that is approximately rectangular in top view, from which center region extend in the plunger-side direction of the body two narrow elongated recesses 10, 11, and on the needle side extend shorter recesses 12, 13 which define with the latter the same center planes. The recesses 10, 12 opposing each other on one side of the body serve with the corresponding portion of the center region 9 for accommodating a syringe 14, wherein the syringe cylinder 15 is accommodated in the center region, and the flange 16 of the cylinder and the plunger rod 17 are accommodated in the plunger-side recess 10. For accommodating the flange, a slot 18 is provided, which is arranged transverse to the longitudinal direction. The chamber is deep enough for accommodating the syringe completely. From the needle-side recess 12, a cylindrical indentation 19 extends in the needle-side direction, which indentation is coaxial to the inserted syringe. For production-related reasons, this indentation is continuous up to the needle-side front side. This indentation has a diameter corresponding to the sealing plug 20 and accommodates the sealing plug of the inserted syringe completely or partially. Of course, a different shape, e.g., slots or the like, can also serve for accommodating the sealing plug. In the plunger-side half of the center region 9 there is provided an opening 21 toward the lower side of the body, which opening serves for removing the syringe from the carrier. Depending on the provisions taken for removing the syringe, the opening 21 can optionally be dispensed with. The two other opposing recesses 11, 13 serve together with the corresponding portion of the center region as a chamber for accommodating a cannula to be used with syringe. The body 2 in the present exemplary embodiment consists of high-density foam, for example EthafoamÂ®. Another material with similar properties can also be used. When placing a prefilled syringe into the carrier, the syringe is first inserted with the sealing plug into the coaxial indentation and is then inserted with the flange into the transverse slot 18. Thereby, the syringe cylinder is fixed in the axial direction. When inserting the flange into the transverse slot, the plunge is pressed into the corresponding recess at the same time. In the process of this, the flange-shaped widening at the end of the plunger rod is also pressed between the walls of the recess and is fixed in the axial direction. For this purpose, the recess is narrower than the width of the end of the plunger rod. Due to the fact that the flange-shaped widening of the plunger rod is held between the side walls of the recess without a defined axial position being provided for this, syringes having different filling levels and correspondingly different plunger positions can be held in the same carrier. Removing the syringe from the carrier is carried by pushing the syringe upward through the opening below. Since the plug is held in the indentation, the needle side of the syringe cannot be moved transverse to its axis, but the flange-shaped end of the plunger rod and the flange of the syringe cylinder have first to be pushed out of the recess before the syringe cylinder can be removed in the axial direction from the indentation. In this manner it is ensured that no undesirable plunger displacement can take place during the removal. Of course, the order of the steps when inserting and/or removing the syringe can also take place differently. Tests that have been carried out have shown that with the carrier according to the invention and with this fixing of a syringe, an axial movement of the plunger due to pressure differences or other uncontrolled influences can be reliably prevented. Of course, when applying the inventive idea, other embodiment variants are obvious. Thus, it is possible to provide a carrier that has no receptacle for a cannula, but accommodates only the syringe. For removing, there are also possible variants, for example a strap lying underneath the syringe for lifting the flange or plunger side or a widening of the chamber next to the syringe cylinder, instead of the opening toward the lower side. 1.
