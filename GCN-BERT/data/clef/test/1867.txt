This invention relates in general to the field of telecommunications. More specifically, the invention, according to a first aspect, relates to a system for using a mobile telephone network with the assistance of a first entity provided for storing value data corresponding to the network communication time, wherein the first entity is associated with a code identifying user terminal means belonging to the network, by way of a pre-established relationship between a network operator and the user of the terminal means, which system includes a management server housing a first database for recording the data relating to at least the first entity. Thus, the system of the invention has a very specific application in the use of a mobile telephone network, where the pre-established relationship between the operator and the user is created by the first entity which may, for example, be a prepaid account, intended to enable the use of the mobile telephone network of the telecommunications operator with which the user is registered. Such user accounts are now commonly used to allow access without a subscription, by means of a mobile telephone, to an operator's mobile telephone network of. These user accounts where telephone units corresponding to the network communication time are stored thus enable prepaid calls to be made and/or various services offered by the operator to be accessed. The account is associated with a SIM (Subscriber Identity Module) card number of the operator' s network, inserted into the user's mobile telephone. It is thus easy for the user to control the total cost of his or her communications. However, the constraint that must be taken into account with respect to a subscription system is that the user must recharge his or her account when the credit has been used up, so as to obtain telephone units corresponding to the communication time in order to be able to use the operator's network. Various techniques are currently available for enabling a mobile telephone network to be used in the context of a pre-established relationship between the final user and the operator of the network arid in order to recharge a prepaid mobile telephone account, with the most common being the distribution by the operator of scratch cards on which identification codes are inscribed and covered with an opaque surface intended to be removed. The user then purchases the card for a given amount at a retailer, scratches the opaque surface so as to uncover the identification code, and calls the operator in order to communicate the code thereto. The operator verifies the validity of the code and, if this authentication operation is successful, recharges the prepaid account for the amount associated with the identification code of the card. The disadvantage of this method, for the user, that the user must obtain a physical mg*rHlim-rnamely a scratch card, and transmit the code to the operator as to recharge the account. Another disadvantage involves the distribution of scratch cards, which done through stationary retail outlets. This known method based on tne use or scratcn cards is tnererore relatively inconvenient and does not allow the user flexibility in the management of his or her prepaid account. In addition, for the operator, the use of a scratch card for network access involves a number of restrictive operations, including the production of the card with an associated identification code, the storage of the identification code in a computer authentication server, the distribution and sale of the card, and so on. All of these operations result in high operational costs for the operator. Moreover, the operator is not informed in real time of the purchase of a scratch card by a client. The operator thus has no real means of estimatincr, in real time, the inventory of scratch cards ot the various retailers or of maintaining a record of the trarlSSCt'ibhs Carried out between the clients and the scratch card retailers. Thus, this method using scratch card appears to be very unsuitable for the operator's efficient management of the recharging of prepaid client accounts. This invention, which is based on these different observations, is intended to overcome the aforementioned disadvantages associated with the use of scratch cards, for both the client, the final user of the network, and the operator. With this objective in sight, the invention aims more specifically to implement a system that responds to the need, which is currently unsatisfied, for greater flexibility and simplicity, for the use of a mobile telephone network in the context of a preestablished relationship between the final user and the network operator, which enables the user to use the operator's mobile network without a subscription or any cards for accessing it. To this end, the system of the invention, which consistent with the general definition provided in the preamble above, is essentially characterised in that the server houses a second database for recording data relating to at least one second entity, provided for storing value data corresponding to the network communication time, wherein said second entity assigned to a communication time provider, said system includes a transmission, by means of a secure application from a communication apparatus of the provider to the server, a transfer request including at least the code associated with the first entity, an identifier of the provider and a predetermined value data item, wherein the transfer operation is carried out by the management server upon receipt of the request using second database management means enabling the value data of the second entity to be reduced according to the predetermined value data item, and using first database management means enabling the value data of the first entity to be increased according to the predetermined value data item. In practical terms, the operator must therefore have a network of providers of network communication time, who purchase from said operator telephone units in bulk corresponding to the communication time for use of the network, so as to resell them at retail to the final clients without a physical medium to be managed. The second entity then consists, for example, of a provider account with the operator, where telephone units purchased by the provider from the operator are stored. The final user must previously have been registered in the operator's network by purchasing a SIM card for the operator's network, enabling the user to be identified in the network. According to a feature of the invention, the user terminal means is a mobile telephone and, in an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the code associated with the first entity contained in the transfer request includes the user's mobile number. In an implementation of the system of the invention, the secure application is a public key infrastructure application enabling the provider to sign the transmitted request in order to be authenticated by the server. In an alternative, the provider's communication apparatus is a mobile telephone, and the secure application is housed by a SIM card inserted into the provider's mobile telephone. The provider's identifier contained in the transfer request advantageously includes the provider's mobile number. The request transmitted to the server preferably signed by entering a confidential code on the provider's mobile telephone. The confidential code used for the signature advantageously different from the confidential code used to unlock the telephone. The management server, upon receipt of the request signed by the provider, preferably verifies the signature using authentication means, so as to confirm or reject the transmission of the request and, if the transmission is confirmed, carries out the transfer operation. According to a possible alternative of the invention, prior to the secure transmission of the transfer request by means of the secure application, the system includes the transmission, from the provider's communication apparatus, to verification means of the server, of information constituting the transfer request for prior real-time verification of said information by the server and, after validation of the information constituting the transfer request, the transmission by the server of a request for authentication to the provider, so as to initiate the secure transmission of the transfer request by means of the secure application. In one embodiment, the provider connects to the server in speaking mode by means of his or her communication apparatus using a service telephone number and transmits the information constituting the transfer request to the verification means of the server by typing the code associated with the first entity on the communication apparatus, the provider identifier and the predetermined value data. In another embodiment, the provider transmits the information constituting the transfer request to the verification means of the server using a digital message formulated according to a predetermined format. The verification of the information constituting the transfer request by the verification means of the server preferably consists of verifying that the code associated with the first transmitted entity corresponds to a user belonging to the network according to the pre-established relationship. Advantageously, simultaneously to the verification of the information constituting the transfer request, the server sends, to the provider, a message requesting commercial information relating to the user, enabling the first database to be updated. According to this embodiment, the management server includes means for updating the first database with commercial information relating to the users. In an alternative, the system includes the transmission by the management server of a confirmation of the transfer to the provider and the user. The confirmation is preferably sent by means of a digital message formulated according to a predetermined format. The mobile telephone network used to implement the invention is constituted, for example, by a GSM network, wherein the digital message is preferably constituted by a short message service SMS. As is well known to a person skilled in the art, the acronym GSM stands for "Global System for Mobile communications" and constitutes the international name of a digital cellular radiotelephony system corresponding to the standard which is also called "GSM". The acronym SMS stands for "Short Message Service" and, in the GSM standard, refers to a bidirectional short message service. Nevertheless, the reference in this description to a GSM network must be considered to include the reference to a UMTS network, a GPRS network, and to any telephone network in which a pre-established relationship between the operator and a final user based on a prepaid account can be implemented for the use of said network. The system of the invention has a number of advantages, which can be demonstrated in an application for recharging a prepaid account for a mobile telephone. In particular, this system enables the operator to precisely follow the development of user accounts and provider accounts and thus to improve the verifications. The system also makes it possible to provide the connection with the operator's management server for very simply authorising or denying access to the mobile telephone network. The system of the invention also makes it easier for the user to recharge his or her account, as no physical medium is required for this operation. This system thus makes it possible to eliminate a number of costly physical tasks for the operator, which tasks are essential in the implementation of current methods for recharging a prepaid mobile account based on the use of scratch cards. Other features and advantages of the invention will become more clear from the following description, provided as an indication, which is in no way limiting, in reference to the following accompanying figures in which: - figure 1 diagrammatically and symbolically shows the main actors and operations implemented in the system of the invention, shown in its application for recharging a prepaid mobile telephone account, and - figure 2 diagrammatically shows the architecture of the management server implemented in the context of the system according to this invention. As described above, the invention relates to a system enabling a user to use a mobile telephone network with the assistance of a first entity, in this case a prepaid user account K_UTIL. This user account is provided for storing value data corresponding to the network communication time. The user has a terminal means for accessing the network, typically a mobile telephone EMT and must previously have been registered with a network operator by purchasing a SIM card for the operator's network, which card is to be inserted into said user's mobile telephone. The prepaid user account K_UTIL is in fact associated with a code IDENT, identifying the user's mobile telephone, by means of a pre-established relationship PREPM between a mobile telephone network operator and the user. This code IDENT may consist, for example, of the number of the SIM card of the mobile telephone EMT, or of the user's mobile number MSISDN (acronym for "Mobile Station international ISDN number"), or of any other code that has previously been approved, recorded and accepted by the network. According to the invention, the operator must have a network of providers of network communication time, who purchase, from said operator, who purchase from said operator telephone units in bulk corresponding to the communication time for use of the network, so as to resell them at retail to the final clients. Each provider FOURN approved by the operator to sell telephone units therefore has a provider account K_FOURN with the operator so as to store value data corresponding to the network communication time. A management server SERV belonging to the mobile telephone network houses a first database DB_UTIL for recording the data relating to the various prepaid user accounts and a second database DB_F0URN for recording the data relating to the various provider accounts. In an embodiment of the invention for a prepaid account recharging application, a user addresses a provider approved by the operator of the network with which the user is registered, so as to purchase telephone units corresponding to the network communication time. To do this, the user, or any other person, such as a friend or relative of the user, having the code IDENT associated with the prepaid user account, namely the number MSISDN of the user's mobile and wishing to recharge the user's prepaid account, contacts a provider and asks said provider to recharge the prepaid user account for a given amount D_VAL corresponding to the purchase of a specific time period for communication over the network. After payment by the user or said person by any means, the provider will transmit to the operator's management server the information necessary for recharging the prepaid user account. The system includes the transmission, by means of a secure application dedicated to recharging SIGN, from a communication apparatus TERM_FOURN of the provider to the server SERV, of a transfer request RQT_TRSF including the recharging information, in this case at least the code IDENT associated with the prepaid user account making it possible to identify the user's mobile telephone, the predetermined value data D__VAL, as well as a provider identifier ID_F. The provider's communication apparatus consists of a mobile telephone, and the secure application dedicated to the recharging of a prepaid user account is housed by a SIM card of the operator's network inserted into the provider's mobile telephone. Owing to this feature, the telephone unit retail outlets enabling the network to be used are no longer stationary with respect to the user. The identifier of the provider preferably consists of the provider's mobile number MS I SDN. The provider first enters the secure application making it possible to transmit the recharging information to the server. The provider then enters the mobile number MSISDN IDENT of the user as well as the amount to be recharged D_VAL to the user account K_UTIL, using the mobile telephone keypad. The secure application SIGN installed on the provider's SIM card is a public key infrastructure application making it possible to sign the transactions carried out to authenticate the provider to the management server. Thus, a signature key or a private key is installed on the provider's SIM card and only the provider knows this key. This private key is associated with a public key that the server knows and uses to verify the signature. The provider, after having entered the recharging information IDENT and D_VAL constituting the transfer request, will therefore sign this request using a confidential code. This confidential code is preferably chosen so that it differs from the one used to unlock the telephone. A message comprising the signed request is then transmitted by means of the secure application to the management server SERV. The identifier of the provider ID_F then appears automatically in the header of the message, typically a short message service SMS, comprising the signed request. The server includes authentication means M_AUTH with the public key associated with the private key used by the provider to sign the request, so as to verify the signature. The server authentication means therefore make it possible to confirm or deny the transmission of the transfer request and, if the transmission is confirmed, the server carries out the transfer operation and recharges the prepaid user account K__UTIL for the predetermined amount. Thus, the provider account K_FOURN is debited for the predetermined amount, and the user account K_UTIL is credited for the predetermined amount using the user and provider databases. To do this, the server includes means for managing M_DB both the provider database DB_FOURN, enabling the provider account K_FOURN value data to be reduced according to the predetermined value D_VAL, and the user database DB, enabling the user account K_UTIL value data to be increased according to the predetermined value data D_VAL. A confirmation of the transfer can be sent by the server to the provider and the user, indicating the new balances of their respective accounts. This confirmation can be sent by means of a short message service SMS. According to an alternative, prior to the transmission of the signed transfer request by means of the secure application, the system includes the transmission, from the provider's communication apparatus to the server, of information constituting the transfer request for a prior real-time verification of this information using verification means M__VERIF of the server. To do this, the provider, in a first embodiment, connects to the server in speaking mode using the mobile telephone, by means of a service telephone number and transmits the information constituting the transfer request to the verification means M_VERIF of the server by typing on the mobile telephone keypad the code IDEN associated with the prepaid user account, the provider identifier ID_F and the predetermined value data D_VAL. According to another embodiment, the provider transmits the information constituting the transfer request to the verification means M_VERIF of the server by means of a digital message formulated according to a predetermined format, typically a short message service SMS. In this case, the user identifier ID_F appears automatically in the header of the SMS. For example, the verification of the information constituting the transfer request by the verification means of the server may consist of verifying that the transmitted code IDENT actually corresponds to a user belonging to the mobile telephone network according to the pre-established relationship, and therefore that he or she is indeed registered with the network operator. The verification means can also verify that the balance of the provider account K_FOURN is sufficient for carrying out the operation of transferring the predetermined value data D_VAL to the user account K_UTIL. In this phase, according to an alternative of the invention, the server sends the provider a message requesting commercial information relating to the user, so as to enable the user database DB_UTIL to be updated with this information. This alternative of the system according to the invention is implemented according to criteria dependent on the traffic and quality of the network. If these criteria are satisfied, the server then sends a message to the provider's mobile telephone including various commercial requests to which the user may or may not respond. These requests can, for example, relate to the user's surname, name, age and, more generally, any information that may interest the network operator for commercial purposes. If the user agrees to respond to such requests, the information that he or she provides sent in return from the provider's mobile telephone to the server, enabling the user database DB_UTIL to be updated using updating means M_MAJ of the server. For the implementation of this alternative concerning the optional receipt of requests for commercial information relating to users and the sending of responses, specific applications are provided on the SIM card and the provider's mobile telephone. After validation of the already existing information constituting the transfer request, and possible updating of the user database DB_UTIL with the acquired commercial information relating to the user, the system includes the transmission to the provider's mobile telephone, using server authentication means, of an authentication request, so as to initiate the secure transmission of the transfer request by means of the secure application. The authentication request includes the recharging information IDENT and D_VAL alreadytransmitted by the provider for prior verification. The provider, after having verified the recharging information constituting the transfer request IDENT and D_VAL transmitted in the authentication request, is authenticated by the server by means of said provider's signature. To do this, the provider sends the signed request to the server using a confidential code. As explained above, the server, using its authentication means, verifies the signature so as to confirm or deny the transmission of the transfer request and, if the transmission is confirmed, the server carries out the transfer operation whereby the provider account K_FOURN is debited and the user account K_UTIL is credited for the predetermined amount D_VAL, using the user and provider databases DB_UTIL and DB_FOURN. Also, a confirmation of the transfer can optionally be sent by the server to the mobile telephones of the provider and the user, indicating the new balances of their respective accounts. This confirmation can be sent by means of a short message service SMS. 1.
