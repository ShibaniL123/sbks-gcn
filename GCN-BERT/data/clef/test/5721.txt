See Berge et ah, supra. [0051] As used herein, “treatment” or “treating,” or “palliating” or “ameliorating” are used interchangeably herein. These terms refers to an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including but not limited to therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit. By “therapeutic benefit” is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated. Also, a therapeutic benefit is achieved with the eradication or amelioration of one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that an improvement is observed in the patient, notwithstanding that the patient may still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. For prophylactic benefit, the compositions may be administered to a patient at risk of developing a particular disease, or to a patient reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of a disease, even though a diagnosis of this disease may not have been made. [0052] "Prodrug" is meant to indicate a compound that may be converted under physiological conditions or by solvolysis to a biologically active compound described herein. Thus, the term "prodrug" refers to a precursor of a biologically active compound that is pharmaceutically acceptable. A prodrug may be inactive when administered to a subject, but is converted in vivo to an active compound, for example, by hydrolysis. The prodrug compound often offers advantages of solubility, tissue compatibility or delayed release in a mammalian organism (see, e.g., Bundgard, Η., Design of Prodrugs (1985), ρρ. 7-9, 21-24 (Elsevier, Amsterdam). [0053] A discussion of prodrugs is provided in Higuchi, Τ., et al., "Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems," A.C.S. Symposium Series, Vol. 14, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, ed. Edward Β. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated in full by reference herein. [0054] The term "prodrug" is also meant to include any covalently bonded carriers, which release the active compound in vivo when such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Prodrugs of an active compound, as described herein, may be prepared by modifying functional groups present in the active compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine manipulation or in vivo, to the parent active compound. Prodrugs include compounds wherein a hydroxy, amino or mercapto group is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug of the active compound is administered to a mammalian subject, cleaves to form a free hydroxy, free amino or free mercapto group, respectively. Examples of prodrugs include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol or amine functional groups in the active compounds and the like.

Pharmaceutical Compositions [0080] In certain embodiments, a substituted pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-one derivative compound as described by Formula (I) or (II) is administered as a pure chemical. In other embodiments, the substituted pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-one derivative compound as described by Formula (I) or (II) is combined with a pharmaceutically suitable or acceptable carrier (also referred to herein as a pharmaceutically suitable (or acceptable) excipient, physiologically suitable (or acceptable) excipient, or physiologically suitable (or acceptable) carrier) selected on the basis of a chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice as described, for example, in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (Gennaro, 21st Ed. Mack Pub. Co., Easton, PA (2005)), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety. [0081] Accordingly, provided herein is a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one substituted pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-one derivative compound, or a stereoisomer, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate, solvate, or N-oxide thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The carrier(s) (or excipient(s)) is acceptable or suitable if the carrier is compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipient (ΐ.℮., the subject) of the composition. [0082] One embodiment provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. One embodiment provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a compound of Formula (II) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. [0083] In certain embodiments, the substituted pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-one derivative compound as described by Formula (I) or (II) is substantially pure, in that it contains less than about 5%, or less than about 1%, or less than about 0.1%, of other organic small molecules, such as contaminating intermediates or by-products that are created, for example, in one or more of the steps of a synthesis method. [0084] Suitable oral dosage forms include, for example, tablets, pills, sachets, or capsules of hard or soft gelatin, methylcellulose or of another suitable material easily dissolved in the digestive tract. Suitable nontoxic solid carriers can be used which include, for example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium saccharin, talcum, cellulose, glucose, sucrose, magnesium carbonate, and the like. (See, e.g., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (Gennaro, 21st Ed. Mack Pub. Co., Easton, PA (2005)). [0085] The dose of the composition comprising at least one substituted pyrido [3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-one derivative compound as described herein may differ, depending upon the patient's (e.g., human) condition, that is, stage of the disease, general health status, age, and other factors that a person skilled in the medical art will use to determine dose. [0086] Pharmaceutical compositions may be administered in a manner appropriate to the disease to be treated (or prevented) as determined by persons skilled in the medical arts. An appropriate dose and a suitable duration and frequency of administration will be determined by such factors as the condition of the patient, the type and severity of the patient's disease, the particular form of the active ingredient, and the method of administration. In general, an appropriate dose and treatment regimen provides the composition(s) in an amount sufficient to provide therapeutic and/or prophylactic benefit (e.g., an improved clinical outcome, such as more frequent complete or partial remissions, or longer disease-free and/or overall survival, or a lessening of symptom severity. Optimal doses may generally be determined using experimental models and/or clinical trials. The optimal dose may depend upon the body mass, weight, or blood volume of the patient. [0087] Oral doses can typically range from about 1.0 mg to about 1000 mg, one to four times, or more, per day. Histone Demethylase [0088] Chromatin is the complex of DNA and protein that makes up chromosomes. Histones are the major protein component of chromatin, acting as spools around which DNA winds. Changes in chromatin structure are affected by covalent modifications of histone proteins and by non-histone binding proteins. Several classes of enzymes are known which can covalently modify histones at various sites. [0089] Proteins can be post-translationally modified by methylation on amino groups of lysines and guanidino groups of arginines or carboxymethylated on aspartate, glutamate, or on the C-terminus of the protein. Post-translational protein methylation has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes such as RNA processing, receptor mediated signaling, and cellular differentiation. Post-translational protein methylation is widely known to occur on histones, such reactions known to be catalyzed by histone methyltransferases, which transfer methyl groups from S-adenyosyl methionine (SAM) to histones. Histone methylation is known to participate in a diverse range of biological processes including heterochromatin formation, X-chromosome inactivation, and transcriptional regulation (Lachner et al., (2003) J. Cell Sci. 116:2117-2124; Margueron et al., (2005) Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 15:163-176). [0090] Unlike acetylation, which generally correlates with transcriptional activation, whether histone methylation leads to transcription activation or repression depends on the particular site of methylation and the degree of methylation (e.g., whether a particular histone lysine residue is mono-, di-, or tri-methylated). However, generally, methylation on Η3Κ9, Η3Κ27 and Η4Κ20 is linked to gene silencing, while methylation on Η3Κ4, Η3Κ36, and Η3Κ79 is generally associated with active gene expression. In addition, tri- and dimethylation of Η3Κ4 generally marks the transcriptional start sites of actively transcribed genes, whereas mono-methylation of Η3Κ4 is associated with enhancer sequences. [0091] A "demethylase" or "protein demethylase," as referred to herein, refers to an enzyme that removes at least one methyl group from an amino acid side chain. Some demethylases act on histones, e.g., act as a histone Η3 or Η4 demethylase. For example, an Η3 demethylase may demethylate one or more of Η3Κ4, Η3Κ9, Η3Κ27, Η3Κ36 and/or Η3Κ79. Alternately, an Η4 demethylase may demethylate histone Η4Κ20. Demethylases are known which can demethylate either a mono-, di- and/or a tri-methylated substrate. Further, histone demethylases can act on a methylated core histone substrate, a mononucleosome substrate, a dinucleosome substrate and/or an oligonucleosome substrate, peptide substrate and/or chromatin (e.g., in a cell-based assay). [0092] The first lysine demethylase discovered was lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1), which demethylates both mono- and di-methylated Η3Κ4 or Η3Κ9, using flavin as a cofactor. A second class of Jumonji C (JmjC) domain containing histone demthylases were predicted, and confirmed when a Η3Κ36 demethylase was found using a formaldehyde release assay, which was named JmjC domain containing histone demethylase 1 (JHDM1/KDM2A). [0093] More JmjC domain-containing proteins were subsequently identified and they can be phylogenetically clustered into seven subfamilies: JHDM1, JHDM2, JHDM3, JMJD2, JARID, PHF2/PHF8, UTX/UTY, and JmjC domain only. JMJD2 Family [0094] The JMJD2 family of proteins are a family of histone-demethylases known to demethylate tri- and di-methylated Η3-Κ9, and were the first identified histone tri-methyl demethylases. In particular, ectopic expression of JMJD2 family members was found to dramatically decrease levels of tri-and di-methylated Η3-Κ9, while increasing levels of mono-methylated Η3- Κ9, which delocalized Heterochromatin Protein 1 (ΗΡ1) and reduced overall levels of heterochromatin in vivo. Members of the JMJD2 subfamily of jumonji proteins include JMJD2C and its homologues JMJD2A, JMJD2B, JMJD2D and JMJD2E. Common structural features found in the JMJD2 subfamily of Jumonji proteins include the JmjN, JmjC, PHD and Tdr sequences. [0095] JMJD2C, also known as GASC1 and KDM4C, is known to demethylate tri-methylated Η3Κ9 and Η3Κ36. Histone demethylation by JMJD2C occurs via a hydroxylation reaction dependent on iron and a-ketoglutarate, wherein oxidative decarboxylation of a-ketoglutarate by JMJD2C produces carbon dioxide, succinate, and ferryl and ferryl subsequently hydroxylates a methyl group of lysine Η3Κ9, releasing formaldehyde. JMJD2C is known to modulate regulation of adipogenesis by the nuclear receptor PPARy and is known to be involved in regulation of self-renewal in embryonic stem cells. JAR1D Family [0096] As used herein, a "JARID protein" includes proteins in the JARID1 subfamily (e.g., JARID1 A, JARID IB, JARID 1C and JARID ID proteins) and the JARID2 subfamily, as well as homologues thereof. A further description and listing of JARID proteins can be found in Klose et al. (2006) Nature Reviews/Genetics 7:715-727. The JARID 1 family contains several conserved domains: JmjN, ARID, JmjC, PHD and a C5HC2 zing finger. [0097] JARID 1 A, also called KDM5A or RBP2, was initially found as a binding partner of retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. JARID 1A was subsequently found to function as a demethylase of tri- and di-methylated Η3Κ4 , and has been found to promote cell growth, while inhibiting senescence and differentiation. For instance, abrogation of JARID 1A from mouse cells inhibits cell growth, induces senescence and differentiation, and causes loss of pluripotency of embryonic stem cells in vitro. JARID 1A has been found to be overexpressed in gastric cancer and the loss of JARID 1A has been found to reduce tumorigenesis in a mouse cancer model. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that loss of the retinoblastome binding protein 2 (RBP2) histone demethylase suppresses tumorigenesis in mice lacking Rbl or Men 1 (Lin etal. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, August 16, 2011, 108(33), 13379-86; doi: 10.1073/pnas.l 110104108) and lead to the conclusion that RBP2-inhibitory drugs would have anti-cancer activity. [0098] JARID IB, also referred to as KDM5B and PLU1, was originally found in experiments to discover genes regulated by the HER2 tyrosine kinase. JARID IB has consistently been found to be expressed in breast cancer cell lines, although restriction of JARID IB has been found in normal adult tissues, with the exception of the testis. In addition, 90% of invasive ductal carcinomas have been found to express JARID IB. In addition, JARID IB has been found to be up-regulated in prostate cancers, while having more limited expression in benign prostate, and has also been found to be up-regulated in bladder cancer and lung cancer (both SCLC and NSCLC). JARID1B has also been found to repress tumor suppressor genes such as BRCA1, CAV1 and 14-3-3 σ, and knockdown of JARID IB was found to increase the levels of tri-methylated Η3Κ4 at these genes.

In an additional embodiment is the method for inhibiting a histone-demethylase enzyme, wherein the histone-demethylase enzyme is selected from JARID1A, JARID1B, JMJD2C, or JMJD2A. Methods of Treatment [00101] Disclosed herein are methods of modulating demethylation in a cell or in a subject, either generally or with respect to one or more specific target genes. Demethylation can be modulated to control a variety of cellular functions, including without limitation: differentiation; proliferation; apoptosis; tumorigenesis, leukemogenesis or other oncogenic transformation events; hair loss; or sexual differentiation. For example, in particular embodiments, the invention provides a method of treating a disease regulated by histone methylation and/or demethylation in a subject in need thereof by modulating the activity of a demethylase comprising a JmjC domain (e.g., a histone demethylase such as a JHDM protein(s)).

[00358] The assay reaction was initiated by the following: 2 μΐ of the mixture of 900 ηΜ H3K9me3-biotin labeled peptide and 6 μΜ alpha-ketoglutaric acid with 2 μΐ of 11-point serial diluted inhibitor in 3% DMSO were added to each well of the plate, followed by the addition of 2 μΐ of 0.9 ηΜ JMJD2C to initiate the reaction. The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes, and terminated by the addition of 6 μΐ of 5 mM EDTA in LANCE detection buffer containing 100 ηΜ Phycolink Streptavidinallophycocyanin and 2 ηΜ Europium-anti-H3K9me2 antibody. Plates were read by EnVisionMultilabel Reader in TR-FRET mode (excitation at 320nm, emission at 615nm and 665nm) after 1 hour incubation at room temperature. A ratio was calculated (665/615) for each well and fitted to determine inhibition constant (IC50). [00359] The ability of the compounds disclosed herein to inhibit demethylase activity was quantified and the respective IC50 value was determined. Table 3 provides the IC50 values of various compounds disclosed herein.

This quantitative immuno-blotting assay measures the amount tri-methylated histone Η3 at amino acid Lysine number 4, a specific substrate and product of the direct enzymatic activity of the histone demethylases KDM5A and KDM5B from extracts of the ZR-75-1 breast cancer cell line. Assay Principle [00361] This assay is a fluorometric immunoassay for the quantification of tri-methyl Η3Κ4 extracted from cells treated with test compound and is used as a measure of the cellular inhibition of KDM5A/B. Assay Method [00362] ZR-75-1 (PTEN null, ER+) breast cancer cells numbering 50,000 (.ATCC) were seeded into each well of a 96-well tissue culture treated plate and then exposed to an 11 point dilution of test compound with final concentration ranges of test compound ranging from 1250 μΜ to 10 ηΜ. Cells were left in the presence of test compound for 72 hours. Extracts were prepared containing all of the cellular histone material using detergent based lysis and sonication methods. These lysates were subsequently normalized for total protein content using a colorimetric bicinchonic acid assay (MicroBCA Pierce/Thermo Scientific). Normalized cell extracts were then subjected to typical immuno-blotting procedures using NuPage reagents (Life Technologies). Electrophoretically separated histones were then transferred and immobilized using polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-FL Millipore). The amount of tri-methylated lysine 4 of histone Η3 was detected using an antibody specific to the tri-methylated state (Cell Signaling Technologies) and quantified on an infrared imager using a densitometry software package (Odyssey CLx, Image Studio, Li-Cor). This background subtracted densitometry value was reported as a ration of the GAPDH amount for that sample and then calculated as a percent of the DMSO treated sample. The software package XL-fit (IDBS) was then used to calculate a relative IC50 value for the dilution series of a given test compound according to the equation: fit = (D+((Vmax*(xAn))/((xAn)+(KmAn)))).
