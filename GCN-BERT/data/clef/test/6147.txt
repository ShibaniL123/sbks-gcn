Vaccine composition for use against influenza The present invention relates to a vaccine composition, in particular for use against influenza. Human and avian influenza are widespread pandemias with high levels of mortality and morbidity each season. Among influenza viruses, which are enveloped RNA viruses which belong to the family of Orthomyxoviridae, the principal cause of influenza is the influenza A virus. Influenza A virus can be further differentiated into subtypes by the antigenic properties of its surface proteins: hemagglutinin (Η) and neuraminidase (Ν). Fifteen Η and nine Ν subtypes have been identified until now. Although many combinations of these subtypes have been found in animals, only Η1, Η2, Η3, Ν1 and Ν2 have established stable lineages in the human population since 1918. Influenza A has a high natural mutation rate and changes its antigenic characteristics frequently, either by gradual antigenic drift over time (that is to say by random point mutations inserted by the virus polymerase, translating into changes in the amino acid sequence of the respective proteins), or by sudden recombination with another virus subtype, known as antigenic shift (when an host is simultaneously infected with two different strains of influenza virus). The main strategy used to fight the disease is vaccination with either inactivated or live attenuated vaccines. Various vaccines have been developed against influenza such as the seasonal influenza vaccines Fluzone®, Vaxigrip®, Mutagrip® and Imovax Gripe® commercialized by Sanofi-Pasteur, Fluarix®, Gripovax®, and FluLaval® commercialized by GlaxoSmithKline, FluMist® commercialized by Medlmmune, Afluria® commercialized by CSL Biotechnologies or Begrivac®, Fluad®, Fluvirin® and Agrippal® commercialized by Novartis. Influenza vaccines also include pandemic influenza vaccines such as Celvapan® (Baxter), Daronrix®, Pandemrix® and Prepandrix® (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals), Focetria® and Optaflu® (Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics), IDflu® and Intanza® (Sanofi Pasteur). Nevertheless, available vaccines are active for short periods of time and only for specified strain types (hemagglutinins). Emergence of resistant viral variants and adverse effect created a need for improved prevention of influenza virus infections, in particular of simultaneous prevention of distinct influenza virus strains infections. Surprisingly, the inventors have found that the use of a derivative of galactosylceramides as an adjuvant in an influenza vaccine increased the potency of the vaccine composition. Specifically, they showed that such compounds increased the isotype switching (increased production of lgG2a and lgG2b) and unexpectedly induced the activation of cytotoxic Τ lymphocytes against the influenza epitope, in particular a Th1 activation, whereas current flu vaccines mainly increase the IgG production. Additionally, the inventors surprisingly showed that the use of a derivative of galactosylceramides as an adjuvant in an influenza vaccine induced a cross protection, /.℮. they increased the potency of the vaccine composition towards an infecting strain different from the strain used for manufacturing the influenza vaccine. The present invention thus relates to a vaccine composition comprising: - at least one prophylactically active agent against influenza, said prophylactically active agent against influenza optionally containing an adjuvant, and - at least one adjuvant, said adjuvant being a derivative of a galactosylceramide. In one aspect the present invention provides a vaccine composition comprising: - at least one prophylactically active agent against influenza, and - at least one adjuvant, said adjuvant being the compound PBS-96 of following formula (III) 2a or the compound PBS-14 of following formula (IV) In the context of the invention, a "vaccine composition" or "vaccine" refers to a composition which, when administered to a subject, induces cellular and/or humoral immune responses. "Subject" refers herein to an animal, such as a vertebrate or a mammal, preferably a non-human or human mammal. Examples of vertebrates include birds and poultry, in particular chicken. Examples of non-human mammals include rodents, horses, swine and primates. Most preferably, a subject is human. in the context of the invention, "influenza" or "flu" refers to an nfectious disease of birds and mammals caused by RNA viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae, named influenza virus. In humans, common symptoms of the disease are chills and fever, sore throat, muscle pains, severe headache, coughing, weakness and general discomfort. In more serious cases, influenza causes pneumonia, which can be fatal, particularly in young children and the elderly. Influenza may be transmitted from infected mammals through the air by coughs or sneezes, creating aerosols containing the virus, and from infected birds through their droppings. Influenza may also be transmitted by saliva, nasal secretions, feces and blood. Infections may also occur through contact with these body fluids or with contaminated surfaces. In the context of the invention, an "influenza virus" refers to the causative agent of flu. It is an enveloped RNA virus with a segmented genome consisting of eight single-stranded negative RNA segments, and belongs to the family of Orthomyxoviridae. Influenza viruses according to the invention encompass the three subtypes Influenza A, Influenza Β and Influenza C viruses. These subtypes are based on antigenic differences in two of the structural proteins of the virus the matrix protein M2 and the nucleoprotein. Preferably the influenza virus according to the invention is an Influenza A virus. More preferably, the influenza virus is selected from the group consisting of the strains Η1Ν1, Η1Ν2, Η2Ν2, Η3Ν1, Η3Ν2, Η5Ν1 and Η7Ν7 strains. More particularly, it is well-known from the one skilled in the art, that influenza may be seasonal or pandemic. Seasonal influenza is typically due to a strain defined and recommended by the Word Health Organization. Currently (in 2009), circulating influenza strains causing seasonal influenza are in particular Η1Ν1, Η3Ν2 and Β influenza strains. In the past, Η2Ν2 influenza strain was also responsible for seasonal influenza. Until 2008, pandemic influenza was for example due to Η1Ν1 or Η7Ν7 influenza strains. A "prophylactically active agent" as used herein refers to any compound of organism liable to induce an immune response against an infection by an influenza virus. Examples of prophylactically active agents which may be suitable against influenza include polypeptide, polynucleotide, carbohydrate moiety, glycoprotein, whole influenza virus, split influenza virus.

As used herein, a "live non-attenuated influenza virus" refers to a living enveloped RNA virus with a segmented genome consisting of eight single-stranded negative RNA segments, and belonging to the family of Orthomyxoviridae. As used herein, a "live attenuated influenza virus" refers to living influenza virus strain displaying a naturally weak virulence. Live attenuated influenza viruses include strains of influenza that are cold-adapted and temperature-sensitive. Methods to obtain live attenuated viruses are well-known from those skilled in the art and include serial passages in hen eggs until obtaining mutants that have lost their pathogenic potential (Hilleman (2002) Vaccine 20:3068-3087). As used herein, a "killed influenza virus" or "inactivated influenza virus" refers to killed influenza viruses obtained by known methods, the most common of which is to grow the virus in fertilized hen eggs, to purify it and to inactivate it, for example, by treatment with detergent. As used herein, a "subunit of an influenza virus" refers to a nucleic acid, a polypeptide, a protein from said influenza virus or a mixture thereof. In particular, a subunit of an influenza virus is a protein of said influenza virus selected from the group consisting of hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, nucleoprotein, Μ1, M2, NS1, NS2(NEP), PA, ΡΒ1, PB1-F2 and ΡΒ2.

Preferably, the influenza virus according to the invention originates from a host which is an animal, in particular a mammal or a bird. More preferably, the host of the influenza virus is selected from the group consisting of a human, a horse and a bird. In the context of the invention, an "adjuvant" refers to a substance that increase or modify the immunogenic potency of the prophylactically active agent.

The at least one prophylactically agent active against influenza may be from an Η3Ν1 influenza strain and is effective for the prevention and/or treatment of an influenza infection due to an Η3Ν1 influenza strain and an influenza infection due to an influenza strain selected from the group consisting of Η1Ν1, Η1Ν2, Η2Ν2, Η3Ν2, Η5Ν1 and Η7Ν7. The at least one prophylactically agent active against influenza may be from an Η3Ν2 influenza strain and is effective for the prevention and/or treatment of an influenza infection due to an Η3Ν2 influenza strain and an influenza infection due to an influenza strain selected from the group consisting of Η1Ν1, Η1Ν2, Η2Ν2, Η3Ν1, Η5Ν1 and Η7Ν7. The at least one prophylactically agent active against influenza may be from an Η5Ν1 influenza strain and is effective for the prevention and/or treatment of an influenza infection due to an Η5Ν1 influenza strain and an influenza infection due to an influenza strain selected from the group consisting of Η1Ν1, Η1Ν2, Η2Ν2, Η3Ν1, Η3Ν2 and Η7Ν7. The at least one prophylactically agent active against influenza may be from an Η7Ν7 influenza strain and is effective for the prevention and/or treatment of an influenza infection due to an Η7Ν7 influenza strain and an influenza infection due to an influenza strain selected from the group consisting of Η1Ν1, Η1Ν2, Η2Ν2, Η3Ν1, Η3Ν2 and Η5Ν1. Typically, the at least one prophylactically agent active against influenza is from an Η1Ν1 or an Η3Ν2 influenza strain and is effective for the prevention and/or treatment of an influenza infection due to an Η1Ν1 or Η3Ν2 influenza strain and an influenza infection due to an Η5Ν1 or Η3Ν8 influenza strain. Additionally, the adjuvant according to the invention has the property of increasing the efficiency of the at least one prophylactically agent active against influenza. In particular, the use of the adjuvant according to the invention enables to decrease the number of administered doses of prophylactically agent active against influenza. For example, an administration of one dose of vaccine according to the invention comprising the prophylactically agent active against influenza with the adjuvant according to the invention is as efficient as the administration of two doses of vaccine comprising the prophylactically agent active against influenza without the adjuvant according to the invention. Similarly, an administration of one or two doses of vaccine according to the invention comprising the prophylactically agent active against influenza with the adjuvant according to the invention is as efficient as the administration of three doses of vaccine comprising the prophylactically agent active against influenza without the adjuvant according to the invention. The use of the adjuvant according to the invention also enables to decrease the dose of the prophylactically agent active against influenza. The adjuvant according to the invention also has the property of activating cytotoxic Τ lymphocytes against the influenza epitope, in particular inducing a Th1 response, whereas the at least one prophylactically agent active against an influenza virus alone only increases IgG production. Furthermore, whereas the prophylactically agent active against influenza usually used in vaccines are less efficient in children (/.℮. a human being who is from birth to 18 years old) and in the elderly (/.℮. a human being who is 65 years old or above), the adjuvant according to the invention increases the efficiency of said prophylactically agent active against influenza in children and in the elderly. The invention is further illustrated by the following figures and examples.

Examples The following examples highlight the increased protection and cross-protection against influenza virus obtained by using N-acetylglycolipids in vaccine compositions. Example 1: Increase in mice survival and cross-protection induced by N-acetylglycolipid adjuvants Materials and methods Two different vaccines were used in the experiments. the commercial human vaccine Agrippal® (purchased from Novartis) which is obtained namely from the Η1Ν1 Influenza A strain, and the commercial horse vaccine Equi Protec-Flu® (purchased from Merial) which is obtained from the Η3Ν8 Influenza A strain. 0.5 ml of each vaccine was diluted at 1/10,000 in NaCI 0.9℅ solution before use. Respectively 100 pi of liposome PBS-57 preparation, liposome PBS-96 preparation, or liposome PBS-14 preparation at 1 mg/ml was diluted at 1/10 in NaCI 0.9% solution. 110 pi of this dilution was then added to 440 pi of each vaccine preparation, so that respectively 1 pg of PBS-57, of PBS-96 or of PBS-14 was contained in 50 pi of each vaccine preparation. For control, 100 pi of liposome preparation was diluted at 1/5 in NaCI 0.9% solution. 110 pi of this dilution was then added to 440 pi of each vaccine preparation. 3 to 4 week-old weaned female mice of C57BI/6 strain were randomly assigned to one of the 9 treatment groups. Mice were acclimatized for less than 5 days and received treatment as followed: - group 1 : unchallenged control - group 2 : challenged untreated - group 3 : Agrippal® only - group 4 : Agrippal® + 1 pg PBS-57 - group 5 : Agrippal® + 1 pg PBS-96 - group 6 : Agrippal® + 1 pg PBS-14 - group 7 : Protec-Flu® only - group 8 : Protec-Flu® + 1 pg PBS-57 - group 9 : Protec-Flu® + 1 pg PBS-14 Equine FI3N8 virus (A/Equine/2/Miami/1/63 (ATCC-VR-317) obtained from Pasteur Institute, Paris, France) was used in viral challenges. Animals received intravenously 100 pi of influenza inoculum preparation. The treatment scheme was as follows: - on day 0, the vaccine (control, Agrippal® or Protec-Flu®) was injected by intramuscular route to the mice, with or without the tested adjuvant. - on day 7, the Η3Ν8 virus was injected by intravenous route to the mice. - on days 21 to 24 (14 to 17 post challenge), the health and weight of the mice were monitored, and the survival and morbidity rates were evaluated. Results At day 10 post challenge, about 60% of untreated mice which had been challenged with the FI3N8 virus strain survived. Among mice that had been treated with the Protec-Flu® vaccine (obtained from the Η3Ν8 strain), at day 15 post-challenge, only 80% of mice treated with Protec-Flu® alone were alive, whereas 100% of mice treated with Protec-Flu® + PBS-57 and of mice treated with Protec-Flu® + PBS-14 were still alive (Figures 1 and 3). The inventors thus demonstrated that the use of N-acetylglycolipids increased considerably the efficacy of the influenza virus vaccine. Among mice that had been treated with the Agrippal® vaccine (obtained namely from the Η1Ν1 strain), at day 15 post challenge, only 65% of mice treated with Agrippal® alone were alive, whereas 80% of mice treated with Agrippal® + PBS-96, of mice treated with Agrippal® + PBS-57 and of mice treated with Aggripa® + PBS-14 were still alive (Figures 2 and 3). Accordingly, the inventors demonstrated that the use of the Νacetylglycolipids PBS-57, PBS-96 and PBS-14 not only increased the efficacy of the influenza virus vaccine but also enabled to protect animals against an influenza strain different from the one used to manufacture the vaccine. Example 2: detection of IgGI, lgG2a and lgG2b in mouse sera after intramuscular administration of Agrippal® vaccine and N-acetylglycolipid adjuvants Mice were injected at day 0 and day 21 with : PBS, 1 pg Agrippal® alone, 1 pg Agrippal® + 1 pg PBS-57 in pegylated form or liposome formulation (PBS-57/S or PBS-57/L) or PBS-14 liposome formulation (PBS-14/L), 4 pg Agrippal® alone, 4 pg Agrippal® + 1 pg PBS-57/S or PBS-57/L or PBS-14/L, 8.9 pg Agrippal® alone, or 8.9 pg Agrippal® + 1 pg PBS-57/S or PBS-57/L or PBS-14/L. Sera were collected at day 42 and the lgG1, lgG2a and lgG2b content of the sera was analysed by ELISA. Results are displayed on Figures 4 to 6. The analyses show that whereas increased levels of Agrippal®, when administered alone, do not enhance the level of lgG1, lgG2a and lgG2b produced, the combination of Agrippal® with PBS-57 or PBS-14, even with the lowest dose of Agrippal®, increases the amount of detectable lgG1, lgG2a and lgG2b. Noteworthy, the levels of IgG 1, lgG2a and lgG2b were not significantly further increased when the dose of Agrippal® combined to PBS-57 or PBS-14 was increased. Example 3: indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) testing of mice sera by intramuscular route immunized twice with Fluarix® Mice were injected by intramuscular route at day 0 and day 21 with: NaCI, - 1 pg Fluarix® alone, 1 pg Fluarix® + 1 pg PBS-57/S, or 1 pg Fluarix® + 1 pg PBS-57/L. Fluarix® vaccine comprises a mixture of A/Brisbane/10/2007-like, A/Brisbane/59/2007-like, and B/Florida/4/2006-like strains. Sera were collected at day 42 and reactivity with the three prototypical strains (A/Brisbane/10/2007, A/Brisbane/59/2007, and B/Florida/4/2006) of Fluarix® vaccine was assayed by measuring IHA titers for each of these strains (see Figure 7). It was found that PBS-57, whether in solution or liposome formulation, significantly enhanced IHA titers induced by Fluarix® vaccination against A/Brisbane/10/2007 and B/Florida/4/2006 strains (Table 1). IHA titers against A/Brisbane/59/2007 strain were also enhanced but to a less significant level. Table 1: Level of significance of enhanced IHA titers induced by PBS-57 A/Brisbane/10/2007 1 pg Fluarix vs 1 pg Fluarix® + PBS-57/S Ρ 0.0004 *** A/Brisbane/10/2007 1 pg Fluarix vs 1 pg Fluarix® + PBS-57/L Ρ 0.0008 *** B/Florida/4/2006 1 pg Fluarix vs 1 pg Fluarix® + PBS-57/S Ρ <0.0001 *** B/Florida/4/2006 1 pg Fluarix vs 1 pg Fluarix® + PBS-57/L Ρ 0.0015 ** The same results were obtained with PBS-14 and PBS-96. Example 4: indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) testing of mice sera immunized twice with Agrippal® Mice were injected by intramuscular route at day 0 and day 21 with : nothing (naive mice), - PBS, 4 pg Agrippal® alone, 8.9 pg Agrippal® alone, 4 pg Agrippal® + 1 pg PBS-57 in liposome formulation (PBS-57/L) or PBS-14 liposome formulation (PBS-14/L), or - 8.9 pg Agrippal® + 1 pg PBS-57 in PEGylated form (PBS-57/S) or PBS-57/L or PBS-14/L. Agrippal® vaccine comprises a mixture of A/Brisbane/10/2007-like, A/Brisbane/59/2007-like, and B/Florida/4/2006-like strains. Sera were collected at day 42 and reactivity with the three prototypical strains (Η3 A/Brisbane/10/2007, Η1 A/Brisbane/59/2007, and B/Florida/4/2006) of Agrippal® vaccine was assayed by measuring IHA titers for each of these strains (see Figure 8). It was found that PBS-57 and PBS-14 increased IHA titers as compared with the Agrippal® vaccine alone (Table 2). Table 2: Level of significance of enhanced IHA titers induced by PBS-57 and PBS-14 Virus Vs Ρ * Η3 4 pg Agrippal® 4 pg Agrippal® + PBS-57/S 0.0088 ** Η3 4 pg Agrippal® 4 pg Agrippal® + PBS-57/L 0.0086 ** Η3 4 pg Agrippal® 4 pg Agrippal® + PBS-14/L 0.0013 ** Η1 4 pg Agrippal® 4 pg Agrippal® + PBS-57/S 0.0241 * Η1 4 pg Agrippal® 4 pg Agrippal® + PBS-57/L 0.0094 ** Η1 4 pg Agrippal® 4 pg Agrippal® + PBS-14/L <0.0001 *** Β 4 pg Agrippal® 4 pg Agrippal® + PBS-57/S 0.0017 ** Β 4 pg Agrippal® 4 pg Agrippal® + PBS-57/L 0.0038 ** Β 4 pg Agrippal® 4 pg Agrippal® + PBS-14/L <0.0001 *** The same results were obtained with PBS-96. Example 5: indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) testing of mice sera immunized once with Agrippal® Mice were injected by intramuscular route at day 0 with : NaCI, PBS-57/D alone, PBS-57/L alone, PBS-57/S alone, 4 pg Agrippal® alone, 8.9 pg Agrippal® alone, 4 pg Agrippal® + 1 pg PBS-57 in liposome formulation (PBS-57/L) or in pegylated form (PBS-57/S) or in DMSO (PBS-57/D), or 8.9 pg Agrippal® + 1 pg PBS-57/L or PBS-57/S or PBS-57/D. Sera were collected at day 21 and reactivity with the three prototypical strains (Η3 A/Brisbane/10/2007, Η1 A/Brisbane/59/2007, and B/Florida/4/2006) of Agrippal® vaccine was assayed by measuring IHA titers for each of these strains (see Figure 9). PBS-57 and PBS-14 increased IHA titers as compared with the Agrippal® vaccine alone after a single injection. Table 3: Level of significance of enhanced IHA titers induced by PBS-57 Η3 Vs Ρ * 4 pg Agrippal® 4 pg Agrippal® + PBS-57/D <0.0001 *** 4 pg Agrippal® 4 pg Agrippal® + PBS-57/S <0.0001 *** 4 pg Agrippal® 4 pg Agrippal® + PBS-57/L <0.0001 *** These results show that the adjuvants avoid prime boost vaccination in seasonal flu. Example 6: activation of specific Τ cell in mice immunized with Fluarix®and PBS-57 Mice were immunised by intramuscular route with 4 pg or 9 pg HA antigen in combination or not with PBS-57 (1 pg). H-2Kb ΝΡ (ASNENMETM; SEQ ID NO: 1)-specific CD8+ Τ cells were monitored in the blood at different time points by multimeric peptide/class I complexes analyses. Highest expansion of H-2Kb NP-specific CD8+ Τ cells was found in vaccinated animals, 14 days following immunisation, with PBS-57, at the doses tested (Figure 10). On days 21 after the priming, the frequency of these cells in the blood was steady, as compared to day 14. The same results were obtained with PBS-14 and PBS-96, and with Aggripal® instead of Fluarix®. Example 7: Vaccination flu challenge model A study similar to the one presented in Exemple 1 was performed by the inventors but in more drastic conditions and under a higher number of conditions. a) Immunization protocol Balb/c mice were injected at day 0 by intramuscular route with Fluarix® 1/30,000 or Agrippal® 1/30,000 optionally combined with PBS-14/L, PBS-57-L or PBS-96/L. The concentrations of Fluarix® and Agrippal® were selected to achieve 50% survival over the period of monitoring when the flu vaccine is administered alone. At day 21, anesthetized mice were inoculated by intranasal route with a Η3Ν8 strain with high pathogenicity (0% survival in the group of untreated mice challenged with the virus). From day 21 to day 35, health and weight of the mice were monitored and the survival and morbidity rates were determined. b) Results The results obtained with Fluarix® and Agrippal® are shown respectively on Figures 11 and 12. As demonstrated by the increased number of surviving mice, the adjuvants enhanced protection against challenge as compared with the Fluarix® or Agrippal® vaccine administered alone. Example 8: In vitro iNKT activation Adults PBMC and cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) were either non stimulated, or cultured in vitro with IL-2 alone or IL-2 combined with 100 ng α-GalCer or PBS-57/D or PBS-57/L (at 10 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml). After 7 days of culture, activation of iNKT was determined by assessing the percentage of VB11/Va24+ cells amplified from PBMC or CBMC (Figures 13 and 14). The inventors demonstrated that PBS-57 induced a stronger activation of iNKT compared to a-GalCer, both in adults PBMC and CBMC. The same experiments are performed on elderly PBMC, i.e. PBMC from 65-years old or more adults. Similar results are obtainable (Figure 15). Example 9: ELISPOT on monkey's PBMC immunized with adjuvants Material and methods Animals Young Macaca fascicularis of 3.5 kg from Mauritius were used with permission of the Noveprim Ethics Committee. Each macaque bears an individual identification number tattooed on the inner right thight. Immunization Fluarix® alone or with 10 pg/kg or 100 pg/kg of PBS-57 or PBS-96 was injected twice in the same ipsilateral muscle area. Sample collection Blood collection was performed 0, 21 or 42 days after immunization. PBMC were purified from the blood using a density gradient purification. They were then cultured and stimulated with Flu Τ cell epitopes or vaccine to evaluate IFN-y responses in ELISPOT assays. Results The inventors showed that an increased number of spots was obtained when the monkeys were immunized with Fluarix® + PBS-57 or Fluarix® + PBS-96 compared to Fluarix® alone (Figure 16). Example 10: Η5Ν1 challenge study in mice, using seasonal Fluarix® vaccine with PBS-96. This study demonstrates the potency of PBS-96 to induce a cross-protection towards an influenza strain different from the one present in the tested vaccine. Balb/c mice were used and immunized either with: 1) Nacl Mock (no infection) 2) Fluarix® alone (1/30,000) 3) PBS-96 (100 ng) 4) Fluarix® + PBS-96 5) NaCI Τ+ The mice were also injected intranasally with Η5Ν1 virus (A/Vietnam 1194/04 strain) 104 CCID5o. The number of living mice was determined each day. The inventors showed that whereas mice immunized with Fluarix® were almost all dead 8 days after infection, 41% of the mice immunized with Fluarix® + PBS-96 were still alive 20 days after infection (Figure 17). Example 11: detection of lgG1 and lgG2b in mouse sera after a single intramuscular administration of Agrippal® vaccine and N-acetylglycolipid adjuvants Mice were injected at day 0 with: PBS, 1 pg Agrippal® alone, 1 pg Agrippal® + 1 pg PBS-57 in pegylated form or liposome formulation (PBS-57/S or PBS-57/L) 4 pg Agrippal® alone, 4 pg Agrippal® + 1 pg PBS-57/S or PBS-57/L, 8.9 pg Agrippal® alone, or 8.9 pg Agrippal® + 1 pg PBS-57/S or PBS-57/L. Sera were collected at day 21 and the lgG1 and lgG2b content of the sera was analysed by ELISA. Results are displayed on Figures 18 and 19. The analyses show that whereas increased levels of Agrippal®, when administered alone, do not enhance the level of lgG1 and lgG2b produced, the combination of Agrippal® with PBS-57, even with the lowest dose of Agrippal®, increases the amount of detectable lgG1 and lgG2b. Noteworthy, the levels of lgG1 and lgG2b were not significantly further increased when the dose of Agrippal® combined to PBS-57 was increased. Similar results were obtained with PBS-14 and PBS-96. Example 12: indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA) testing of mice sera immunized once with Agrippal® Mice were injected by intramuscular route at day 0 with : PBS, 1 pg PBS-57 in DMSO (PBS-57/D) alone 1 pg PBS-57 in PEGylated form (PBS-57/S) alone, 1 pg PBS-57 in liposome formulation (PBS-57/L) alone, 4 pg Agrippal® alone, 8.9 pg Agrippal® alone, 4 pg Agrippal® + 1 pg PBS-57/D, PBS-57/S or PBS-57/L, or 8.9 pg Agrippal® + 1 pg PBS-57/D, PBS-57/S or PBS-57/L. Agrippal® vaccine comprises a mixture of A/Brisbane/10/2007-like, A/Brisbane/59/2007-like, and B/Florida/4/2006-like strains. Sera were collected at day 21 and reactivity with the three prototypical strains (Η3 A/Brisbane/10/2007, Η1 A/Brisbane/59/2007, and B/Florida/4/2006) of Agrippal® vaccine was assayed by measuring IHA titers for each of these strains (see Figure 20). It was found that PBS-57 increased IHA titers as compared with the Agrippal® vaccine alone. The same results were obtained with PBS-96 and PBS-14, and with Fluarix® instead of Aggripal®.
