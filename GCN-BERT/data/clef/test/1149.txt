Step 2
To Compound 150 (60 mg, 0.122 mmol) in dimethylformamide (10 mL) solution were added sodium hydride (40.0 mg, 0.96 mmol) and isopropyl iodide (0.148 mL, 1.46 mmol), the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. Then, saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution was added thereto, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After concentration under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography (hexane - ethyl acetate) to obtain Compound 151 (27 mg, 42% yield) as yellow foam.
