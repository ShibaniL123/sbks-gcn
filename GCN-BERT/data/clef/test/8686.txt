DESCRIPTION OF THE APPLICATION [0042] FIG. 1 shows a schematic diagram illustrating preferred organizational arrangements of an organic aquaculture production site 101, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention. Preferred embodiments of organic fishery system 100, preferably include the depicted structures and arrangements of organic aquaculture production site 101 and provide preferred apparatus and methods enabling the production of "organic" aquatic livestock 103. In the present disclosure, the term "aquatic livestock" shall include in its definition both freshwater and saltwater aquatic animal species. Such "aquatic livestock" species shall preferably include finfish, preferably tilapia, and, under appropriate circumstances, catfish, carp, trout, etc. Upon reading the teachings of this specification, those of ordinary skill in the art will now understand that, under appropriate circumstances, considering such issues as commercial demand, farming costs, regulatory considerations, etc., the production of other plant and animal species, such as crayfish, lobster, clams, oysters, shrimp, cephalopods (squid and octopus), algae, non-photosynthetic members of the plant kingdom (mushrooms fungus), etc., may suffice. In the present disclosure, the term "organic" shall be understood to include, within the definition, the controlled production of aquatic livestock conducted without exposure of the livestock to drugs, hormones, supplemental synthetic chemicals (including amino acids), heavy metals, organic pollutants, bio- accumulative toxins (PBTs), nutrients containing by-products from mammalian or poultry production, or feed nutrients containing non- organically-produced components. [0043] Such preferred embodiments of organic fishery system 100 preferably establish one or more carefully managed aquatic environments 105, wherein substantially all inputs and outputs to such environment are strictly monitored and controlled. It is within such controlled aquatic environments 105 that the primary organic aquatic livestock 103 are produced. The preferred embodiments of organic fishery system 100 are preferably adapted to use minimal off-site inputs and preferably comprise management practices that operate in harmony with the surrounding ecosystem. Upon reviewing the full scope of the teachings contained herein, those with ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the precisely managed aquatic environments and production methods of organic fishery system 100 are capable of producing aquatic livestock marketable as "100-percent organic" under substantially all current and pending certification rules, regulations, laws, and governing sciences. [0044] Organic aquaculture production site 101 preferably comprises at least one organic production unit 102, as shown. Each organic production unit 102 preferably comprises an interoperating arrangement of apparatus adapted to support both organic aquatic livestock production and beneficial management of the material byproducts of such production. [00453 Aquatic farming unit 102 preferably comprises at least one isolating enclosure 108 structured and arranged to provide a substantially enclosed space physically isolated from the surrounding environment. Each isolating enclosure 108 is preferably used as a vessel in which the controlled aquatic environments 105 of the system are preferably established. Each isolating enclosure 108 preferably functions as an environmental isolator to substantially isolate the organic aquatic livestock 103 from the surrounding terrestrial environment. The highly preferred use of such isolating enclosures 108 essentially eliminates exposure of organic aquatic livestock 103 to disease vectors and environmental toxins (as aquatic livestock reared within the system have minimal direct exposure to the outside environment, which is in contrast to conventionally raised product grown in open ponds, lakes, or ocean pens). [0046] In preferred embodiments of the system, each organic aquaculture production site 101 comprises a plurality of substantially independent controlled aquatic environments 105, each one comprising at least one isolating enclosure 108. It is noted that a single controlled aquatic environment 105 may be divided between multiple interconnected isolating enclosures 108, to accommodate the requirement of the aquatic livestock, operator- preference, etc. [ 0047 ] A controlled aquatic environment 105 of aquatic farming unit 102 is preferably maintained by at least one aquatic iife-support unit 120 preferably functioning to sustain, within isolating enclosure 108, a habitable environment consistent with the sustained growth of organic aquatic livestock 103. Each aquatic life-support unit 120 preferably comprises at least one source of one pollutant-f ee water 107, means to aerate water 107, and means for removing toxic waste compounds from water 107 during the production cycle. [ 0048 ] The pollutant-free water for controlled aquatic environments 105 is preferably sourced from at least one ground well, most preferably an on-site well 109, preferably extracting water 107 from a deep geologic source. Such deep-strata sourcing preference assures that water 107 is free from surface contaminants (bacteria, fungus, fertilizers, pesticides, heavy metals, etc.) . Water 107 is preferably tested to assure that the water chemistry (preferably including mineral content and pH) falls within a level consistent with the organic production. To prevent leaching of soluble metals into water 107 during pumping, on-site well 109 preferably comprises a non-metallic well casing, preferably a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) casing. If another source of water must be use, the water is preferably tested for chemicals, and any chemicals present are preferably removed prior to use to provide water suitable for the production of the organic product. The above described preferred arrangements of organic fishery system 100 preferably at least embody herein at least one pollutant-free water-supplier structured and arranged to supply, to such at least one substantially enclosed container, water substantially free of environmental pollutants. [ 0049 ] A controlled aquatic environment 105 is preferably established by introducing a volume of pollutant-f ee water 107 within at least one isolating enclosure 108 followed by the commencing of the operation of aquatic life-support unit 120. After a preferred conditioning period, at least one production population 110 comprising organic aquatic livestock 103 is preferably introduced into respective isolating enclosures 108 containing controlled aquatic environments 105. [0050 ] In a preferred operation, at least one of the controlled aquatic environments 105 of aquatic farming unit 102 is preferably adapted to function as an isolated nursery 122 for generating a fry population 124 of organic aquatic livestock 103. It is preferably from such fry population 124 that a substantially monosex production population 110 is developed. [ 0051 ] Preferred aquatic livestock species, preferably the cichlid genus Tilapia, are preferably reproduced in such isolated nurseries. Male and female breeding pairs are preferably separated from the production population and housed separately in a smaller hatchery tank for breeding. Once the eggs are fertilized, the male is removed allowing the female to incubate the eggs until the eggs hatch and are released into isolated nursery 122. In the production of tilapia, the time involved is usually about 21 days. The female is then preferably removed and the fry population 124 begins their growth to fingerlings, typically in about another 30 days. Each fingerling typically consumes daily an amount of organic feed 136 equaling approximately two percent of body weight. [0052] At the completion of the about-30-day growth period, the fingerlings are preferably sorted by sex to produce the substantially monosex production population 110. In the preferred operational method of organic fishery system 100, the preferred monosex production population 110 produced from the fry population 124 is all male, due to their higher average growth rates and comparatively higher harvest weights. A preferred method of producing monosex production population 110 is to physically sort males from the mix-sex fry population by visual identification. When tilapias reach about 10 cm in length, the sexes may be distinguished by inspecting the genital papillae on the underside of the fish. To facilitate such a method, fingerlings are preferably swabbed with an organic dye to assist visual differentiation of the external sex structures. [0053] The substantially monosex production population 110 is preferably transferred to one or more larger grow-out enclosures 128, each preferably comprising an isolating enclosure 108 containing at least one controlled aquatic environment 105 (at least embodying herein the step of introducing such at least one substantially monosex production population within such at least one grow-out enclosure and managing such at least one grow-out enclosure to maintain a habitable environment consistent with the growth of such at least one substantially monosex production population and organic production practices) . [ 0054 ] Female fingerlings are preferably used for brood stock or are converted into organic feed 138 used to support at least one secondary aquatic-product production 130, as shown. Secondary aquatic-product production 130 (at least embodying herein, at least one on-site secondary aquatic-product producer) is preferably adapted to produce, substantially onsite, at least one secondary organic aquatic product 132. Preferred secondary organic aquatic product 132 includes organic shell fish, preferably shrimp 134, as shown. [ 0055 ] It is noted that both isolated nursery 122 and secondary aquatic-product production 130 each preferably utilize at least one isolating enclosure 108 preferably containing a controlled aquatic environment 105. As previously noted, each controlled aquatic environment 105 is preferably maintained by at least one aquatic life-support unit 120. Specific preferred arrangements of isolated nursery 122 are illustrated in FIG. 2 through FIG. 4.\ [ 0056 ] The substantially monosex production population 110 customarily reach 1 to 1-1/2 pounds in about 60 to 90 days, from the time they are introduced into grow-out enclosures 128. Thus, the total growth period (from egg to harvest) is typically 120 to 140 days. The preferred use of a substantially monosex production population 110 eliminates the need for behavior-suppressing hormones during production, an important factor in maintaining the ability to achieve organic certification. [ 0057 ] For the above-described production timeframe to be accurate, the food and water must be properly managed during the production cycle. Water 107 is preferably filtered, tested, and replenished as necessary. The input of feed rations to support the growth of organic aquatic livestock 103 is strictly controlled as part of the preferred management of aquatic farming unit 102. Organic aquatic livestock 103 are provided with organic feed 136 preferably formulated using only 100-percent organic components. More specifically, organic feed 136 is preferably free of preferably each and preferably all of: drugs, hormones, supplemental synthetic chemicals, heavy metals, organic pollutants, PBTs, nutrients containing by-products from mammalian or poultry production, and feed nutrients containing non-organically-produced components. Preferred formulations meet the minimum nutritional requirements of organic aquatic livestock 103 and closely match the nutrient compositions found in the natural diet of the particular aquatic species. Preferred formulations of organic feed 136 contain only materials from certified organic sources, preferably including lipids from certified organic fish oil or other omega-3 fatty acids sources, produced by organic microorganisms or organic plants, to meet the nutritional requirement of the particular aquatic species . [0058] During production, organic aquatic livestock 103 are preferably supplied about 1-1/2 pounds of organic feed 136 per pound of organic aquatic livestock 103. [0059] The production population 110 is preferably harvested at the conclusion of a grow-out period associated with the particular aquatic species. For the preferred tilapia fin fish, as noted, the total grow-out period is typically about 120 to 140 days. During the grow-out period, progeny resulting from unintended occurrences of females within the substantially monosex production population 110 are preferably removed from grow-out enclosures 128. A preferred means for removal of juveniles comprises the introduction of at least one predatory species within grow-out enclosure 128. Upon reading this specification, those with ordinary skill in will now appreciate that, under appropriate circumstances, considering such issues as cost, user preference, regulatory requirements, etc., other removal arrangements such as, for example, manual netting of juveniles, etc., may suffice. [ 0060 ] On harvesting, the matured organic aquatic livestock 103 are preferably transferred to at least one on-site processing plant 112 for processing, as shown. On-site processing plant 112 preferably prepares the harvested product for shipping to off-site markets, preferably using one or more distribution channels 114, as shown. On-site processing plant 112 preferably performs cleaning, freezing, and packaging of the product prior to transport. Upon reading this specification, those with ordinary skill in the art will now appreciate that, under appropriate circumstances, considering such issues as cost, market structures, etc., other distribution arrangements such as, for example, incorporating the production site within an end-use market site (e.g., a local seafood market) , providing fresh (unfrozen) product, etc., may suffice. [0061 ] Byproducts of on-site processing plant 112 (carcasses, viscera, and trimmings) are preferably converted to organic feed 138, which are preferably used to support secondary aquatic- product production 130, as shown. A preferred benefit of such preferred methodology is the farming of secondary organic aquatic product 132 (for example, shrimp 134) having higher than expected levels of omega-3 fatty acids. This preferred benefit is a direct result of the preferred use of byproducts of the primary production. Thus, secondary organic aquatic product 132 may be marketed as 100 percent organic and may be marketed as comprising added health benefits associated with enhanced omega-3 content. [ 0062 ] The highly-controlled aquatic environments 105 are preferably managed in a manner consistent with the growth of such production population 110 and strict organic production practices. As part of the preferred production methodology of organic fishery system 100, at least one organic certif cation entity 118 is provided preferably-uninterrupted access to organic aquaculture production site 101 during such organic production. Depending on the prevailing certification requirements at the time of production, organic certification entity 118 may comprise, for example, a governmental organic inspector (e.g., a United States Department of Agriculture field representative), authorized certification contractor, or similar overseeing entity or agent. Regardless of the operating regulatory structures, the system preferably grants organic certification entity 118 full access to observe and test any and all relevant aspects of the production. This preferred feature of the system facilitates the granting of rights to market the processed organic aquatic livestock 103 as certified organic in commerce (as defined and regulated by organic certification entity 118) . Upon reading this specification, those with ordinary skill in the art will now appreciate that, under appropriate circumstances, considering such issues as jurisdiction, markets serviced, etc., other certification arrangements such as, for example, site operator sampling/reporting, random sampling, providing on-site facilities for an organic certification entity, etc., may suffice. [0063] Organic fishery system 100 preferably reduces the environmental impact of production through on-site management of production waste by-products. Aquatic farming unit 102 preferably provides one or more preferred on-site byproduct utilizers 116, as shown. Each on-site byproduct utilizer 116 is preferably designed to utilize at least one byproduct generated by the primary organic aquatic livestock 103 during the organic production. [0064] Within the preferred operation of aquatic farming unit 102, the above described secondary aquatic-product production 130 is a preferred example of an on-site byproduct utilizer 116. In another preferred embodiment of aquatic farming unit 102, on-site byproduct utilizer 116 preferably comprises at least one surface crop 140 structured and arranged to utilized at least one nitrogen- containing solid waste 142 produced by organic aquatic livestock 103 as a fertilizer. In preferred operation, waste water 143 containing solid waste 142 is generated by the backwashing of filters within aquatic life-support units 120. Aquatic farming unit 102 is preferably adapted to deliver waste water 143 {containing the natural fish emulsion) to surface crops 140, as shown. Surface crops 140 may preferably comprise hydroponically- grown plants, conventional surface crops, or a combination of both. Preferred surface crops 140, preferably romaine lettuce, are preferably used as supplemental organic feed for organic aquatic livestock 103. [ 0065 ] In another preferred embodiment of aquatic farming unit 102, on-site byproduct utilizer 116 preferably comprises at least one photosynthetic-organism cultivator 144 structured and arranged to cultivate at least one photosynthetic-organism capable of yielding at least one lipid compound usable in the production of at least one biofuel. Photosynthetic-organism cultivator 144 preferably comprises one or more bio-mass support structures 146 containing at least one algae-based fuel producer 148, as shown. In preferred operation, waste water 143 containing solid waste 142 is preferably transferred to photosynthetic-organism cultivator 144, as shown. Within photosynthetic-organism cultivator 144, the solid waste is first converted to carbon dioxide (CO2) , preferably using the metabolic respiration of one or more bacteria colonies.

Franchisee 502 is preferably responsible for initial capital costs, which may be structured within or apart from the above-described compensations to franchisor 501. [ 00129 ] An alternate preferred provision of franchise 504 preferably addresses the establishment of on-site product processing, preferably in the form of assistance by franchisor 501 in the development of on- site processing plant 112. Thus, under a preferred set of covenants and agreements of franchise 504, franchisor 501 provides essentially a "turnkey" operation. Upon reading this specification, those with ordinary skill in the art will now appreciate that, under appropriate circumstances, considering such issues as franchise cost, franchisor preference, franchisee preference, etc., other franchise terms and provisions such as, for example, establishment by the franchisor of off-site shipping and transportation on behalf of the franchisee, establishment by the franchisor of a product buyer relationship with the franchisee, requiring the franchisee to independently develop the organic production units, etc., may suffice. [00130] Under the preferred terms of franchise 504, franchisor 501 provides to franchisee 502 training and support in the form of at least one training program 512, preferably directed to one or more individuals designated by the franchisee. Training program 512 preferably presents preferred operating protocols detailing how the franchisee will operated the organic aquaculture production site 101 in compliance with franchise 504. Training program 512 is preferably designed to promote the development of at least one site manager 214, who is then able to provide subsequent training to secondary support personnel. Such training is preferably done at the organic aquaculture production site 101, alternately preferably at a corporate headquarters, or a combination of both. Upon reading this specification, those with ordinary skill in the art will now appreciate that, under appropriate circumstances, considering such issues as franchise cost, franchisor/franchisee preferences, etc., other training arrangements such as, for example, establishing a means for providing ongoing training including administrative and technical support, etc., may suffice. [00131] Training program 512 most preferably takes place at the organic aquaculture production site 101 using an initial startup of production as a practical training tool. Thus, designated trainees of franchisee 502 work with one or more trainers to complete initial establishing of the plurality of controlled aquatic environments, setup of required testing and monitoring, generating the fry population and monosex production population, etc. Such training may be assisted through the use of one or more handbooks, manuals, other written materials (preferably including materials distributed electronically), and video, audio and/or software media . [ 00132 ] It is further noted that alternate preferred embodiments of training program 512 preferably encompass an expanded range of franchise-controlled operations, preferably including preferred management of secondary aquatic-product production 130, preferred operation and management of on-site byproduct utilizers 116, preferred operation and management of on-site processing plant 112, preferred interactions with organic certification entity 118 (e.g., assistance in establishing certification monitoring by entity providing organic certification of such organic products) , etc. [ 00133 ] Preferred operating protocols of franchise 504 establish strict guidelines on all inputs to the controlled aquatic environments 105, preferably including the type and source of feed rations used during production. Within the duration of the franchise 504, franchisee 502 is preferably provided access to at least one supply purchase program 514 supplying approved organic feed 136 to be used during production. Franchisee 502 preferably commits to use only the approved organic feed 136 and to acquire feed 136 solely through supply purchase program 514. Supply purchase program 514 is preferably administered within a network of organic feed suppliers, preferably comprising one or more manufactures 515 of the approved organic feed 136. In a preferred arrangement of method 500, franchisor 501 oversees supply purchase program 514, preferably acting as an owner/operator of network of organic feed suppliers. Alternately preferably, the network of organic feed suppliers operates under licenses issued by franchisor 501. In yet another alternate preferred arrangement, franchisor 501 forms the network through a separate organic feed franchising program. [00134] Within the preferred covenants and agreements of franchise 504, franchisee 502 is responsible for the costs associated with ongoing production, preferably including maintenance, employee wages, insurance, advertising, site utilities, taxes, etc. Within the preferred covenants and agreements of franchise 504, franchisee 502 preferably provides regular reports 517 to franchisor 501, preferably including financial reporting of total revenues derived by franchisee 502 along with the results of monitoring and testing. [00135] FIG. 10 shows a schematic flow diagram illustrating a method 600 related to production of the approved organic feed 136 distributed by network of organic feed suppliers described in FIG. 9. As noted above, such feed 136 is usable in the organic farming of organic aquatic livestock 103. [00136] In initial preferred step 602 of method 600, at least one aquatic feed composition is preferably formulated for the production of feed 136. Preferred formulations comprise plant- based proteins derived only from organically-produced plants, and are preferably designed to meet the nutritional requirements of organic aquatic livestock 103 without the use of protein from fish meal or similar animal based by-products. Applicant has determined that such plant- based compositions are highly effective in the healthy production of Tilapia. Upon reading this specification, those with ordinary skill in the art will now appreciate that, under appropriate circumstances, considering such issues as cost, user preference, etc., other protein sources such as, for example, utilizing fish meal and oil from carcasses, viscera, and trimmings from the processing of foreign certified organic farmed aquatic animals, etc., may suffice. [00137] In subsequent preferred step 604, at least one organic producer producing such organically-produced plant material is identified by the manufacturer of the approved organic feed 136. Such organic producer preferably comprises one or more organic farm producers, most preferably organic farm producers operating under in compliance with the organic certification requirements of organic certification entity 118. [00138] In subsequent preferred step 606, the manufacturer of the approved organic feed 136 (preferably comprising at least one member of the network of organic feed suppliers) preferably arranges for the acquisition of necessary amounts of organically- produced plants 607 (see FIG. 9) from the organic producer or producers. In subsequent preferred step 608, the manufacturer of the organic feed 136 uses the acquired organically grown materials to produce the above- described organic feed 136 (at least embodying herein such aquatic feed comprising such at least one aquatic feed composition using such plant-based proteins derived from such at least one organically- produced plant) . The resulting organic feed 136 is then preferably made available to franchisees 502 via the network of organic feed suppliers . [00139] Referring now to FIGs. 11-12, a cleaning system 700 for the isolating enclosure 108 may be seen. The cleaning system 700 may be used to remove waste, food and other debris from the isolating enclosure 108. The removal of waste, food and other debris may be important in order to eliminate the possibility of excessive ammonia levels in the isolating enclosure 108. Decomposition of organic matter in the isolating enclosure 108 may be a main route through which ammonia can enter the isolating enclosure 108. Proteins are highly abundant in all living organisms. These proteins may be made up of soluble building blocks called amino acids. Each amino acid contains an amino group that consists of NH2. So the breakdown of proteins inevitably leads to the release of ammonia into the water . [00140] Due to the rounded configuration of the isolating enclosure 108, the waste, food and other debris should all fall and collect in a bottom segment area 108A of the isolating enclosure 108. The cleaning system 700 may then be used to remove the remove waste, food and other debris that may be located on the bottom segment 108A of the isolating enclosure 108. [00141] In accordance with one embodiment, the cleaning system 700 may be an automated system. Thus, the cleaning system 700 may be designed to automatically remove the waste, food and other debris that may be located on the bottom segment 108A of the isolating enclosure 108 at designated time intervals. [00142] The cleaning system 700 may have a vacuum unit 702. The vacuum unit 702 may have a housing 704. The housing 704 may have an inlet section 706. The inlet section 706 may be configured to run a length of the bottom segment 108A of the isolating enclosure 108. The inlet section 706 may be coupled to a pumping unit 708. The pumping unit 708 may be used to draw the waste, food and other debris, as well as water, that may be located on the bottom segment 108A of the isolating enclosure 108 into the inlet section 706 and out of the isolating enclosure 108 and into a tank 712 or other storage unit. The pumping unit 708 may be located within the housing 704. Alternatively, the pumping unit 708 may be located external to the housing 704 and coupled to the housing via tubing 710 or the like. [ 00143 ] The water, waste, food and other debris collected may be stored in the tank 712 or other storage unit. The mixture of the water and waste, food and other debris collected may be used as a liquid fertilizer. Thus, the tank 712 and its content may be sold to agriculture establishments in the need of liquid fertilizer. Alternatively, the contents in the tank 712 may be bottled and sold as a liquid fertilizer to those in need of such product s . [ 00144 ] A drive system 714 may be coupled to the housing 704. The drive system 714 may be used to move the vacuum unit 702 along the bottom segment area 108A of the isolating enclosure 108. As stated above, the vacuum unit 702 may be automated. Thus, the drive system 714 may be programmed to move the vacuum unit 702 along the bottom segment 108A of the isolating enclosure 108 to remove the waste, food and other debris. The drive system 714 may be programmed to move the vacuum unit 702 in a predetermined pattern, at designated times, or the like. The above listing of programmable features is given as an example and should not be seen in a limiting manner. [ 00145 ] The cleaning system 700 may have a pair of track members 716. The track members 716 may be used to guide the vacuum unit 702 along the bottom segment 108A of the isolating enclosure 108. In accordance with one embodiment, one of the track members 716 may be coupled to each end of the bottom segment 108A of the isolating enclosure 108. The drive system 714 of the vacuum unit 702 may be coupled to the track members 716. Thus, wheels 714A of the drive system 714 may be coupled to the track members 716. This may allow the vacuum unit 702 to move along the track members 716 so that the vacuum unit 702 may clean the bottom segment 108A of the isolating enclosure 108. [ 00146] As shown in FIG. 11, a sensor system 750 for the isolating enclosure 108 may be seen. The sensor system 750 may have a sensing unit 752. The sensing unit 752 may be used to monitor different operating conditions within the isolating enclosure 108. The sensing unit 752 may be comprises of a plurality of different sensors wherein each sensor may be configured to monitor a specific operating condition. For example, the sensing unit 752 may have sensors to monitor oxygen (0≤) levels, ammonia levels, water level, pH level or acidity level, nitrates, and the like. The above listing is given as an example and should not be seen in a limiting manner. The sensing unit 752 may be coupled to a monitoring device 754. The monitoring device 754 may be used to record the readings from the sensing unit 752. The monitoring device 754 may further be used to display the different readings from the sensing unit 752. The monitoring device 754 may further be able to transmit the different readings from the sensing unit 752 to a remote device and or location. [00147] The isolating enclosure 108 may further have an automated feed system 760. The automated feed system 760 may be used to supply feed to the organic aquatic livestock 103. The automated feed system 760 may be configured to supply feed at predetermined intervals. For example, the automated feed system 760 may be programmable such that a person may set the automated feed system 760 to dispense a predetermined amount of feed at predetermined intervals. For example, the automated feed system 760 may be programmed to dispense a predetermined amount of feed every 4 hours. Alternatively, the automated feed system 760 may be configured to adjust the amount of feed dispended at predetermined intervals based on the amount of organic aquatic livestock 103 stored and or monitored in the isolating enclosure 108. [00148] The automated feed system 760 may be comprised of a feed tank 762. The feed tank 762 may be used to store the feed. The feed tank 762 may have a programmable unit 764. The programmable unit 764 may be used to allow a user to select an amount of feed to be dispensed as well as how often the fee will be dispensed. The feed tank 762 may be coupled to a distribution device 766. The distribution device 766 may be used to distribute the feed in the isolating enclosure 108. [ 00149 ] Referring now to FIG. 13, a heating system 800 for the isolating enclosure 108 may be seen. In the past, heating devices for fish tanks and the like generally consisted of resistive heating devices immersed in the tank and controlled by a thermocouple control likewise immersed in the liquid. This arrangement has proved both expensive and inefficient. [ 00150 ] The heating system 800 may operate by heating air which may then be injected into the isolating enclosure 108 as opposed to heating the water in the tank holding the fish as in the prior art. The heating system 800 may use a storage unit 802. The storage unit 802 may house a heating element 804. The heating element 804 which may be used for heating a liquid 806 stored within the storage unit 802. In accordance with one embodiment, the liquid in the storage unit 802 may be water. In accordance with another embodiment, the storage unit 802 may be a 50 gallon drum. The 50 gallon drum may be formed or plastic or other material. [ 00151 ] A thermostat 808 may be coupled to the heating element 804. The thermostat may be used to control the heating temperature of the heating element 804. [ 00152 ] Tubing 810 may be positioned within the storage unit 802 such that the liquid 806 within the storage unit 802 surrounds the tubing 810. The tubing 810 may be coiled within the storage unit 802. In accordance with one embodiment, the tubing may be metal piping, plastic piping, plastic tubing or the like. The above listing is given as an example and should not be seen in a limiting manner. [ 00153 ] The heating system 800 may further have an air pump 812. The air pump 812 may be used for providing an air and or oxygen source. The air pump 812 may have a filter system 814. The filter system 807 may be used to remove any particulates and purify the air and or oxygen exiting the air pump 812. [ 00154 ] A supply line 814 may have a first end 814A coupled to an exit of the air pump 812 and a second end 814B coupled to a first end 810A of the tubing 810. The supply line 814 maybe used to move the air and or oxygen exiting the air pump 812 to the tubing 810. An Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) device 816 may be coupled to or form part of the supply line 814. The UVGI device 816 is a device that uses ultraviolet (UV) light at sufficiently short wavelength to kill bacteria and other microorganisms. [ 00155 ] The air and or oxygen moves through the supply line 814 and through the tubing 810. The heated liquid 806 in the storage unit 802 heats the air and or oxygen in the tubing 810. The heated air and or oxygen may then be sent to the isolating enclosure 108. In accordance with one embodiment, the heated air and or oxygen sent to the isolating enclosure 108 may be sent via tubing 818. The tubing 818 may inject the air and or oxygen into the water stored within the isolating enclosure 108. The heated air and or oxygen injected into the water serves two functions. First, the heated air and or oxygen injected into the water supplies oxygen to the fish in the isolating enclosure 108. Thus, the tubing 818 may act as a bubbler system. Second, the heated air and or oxygen sent may also warm the water within the isolating enclosure 108. Thus, the need for expensive heating elements for the isolating enclosure 108 is generally not required.
