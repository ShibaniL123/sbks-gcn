To a 250 mL, three necked, round bottom flask, equipped with a stir bar and thermometer, N-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1-methylpiperidin-4-amine (10 g; 0.045 mol) and DCM (50 mL) were charged and cooled to 10-15° C. To the resulting solution, 5-6 N HCl in 2-PrOH (3 equiv., 0.135 mmol) was added dropwise over 25 min., white crystals formed, and the solution then cooled to 0-5° C. for 2 hours. Crystals were filtered off, washed with 50 mL of DCM, dried at 50° C./10 mbar for 10 hours yielding 12.8 g (96.4%) of N-(4-fluorobenzyl)-1-methylpiperidin-4-amine dihydrochloride (Compound V×2HCl).
