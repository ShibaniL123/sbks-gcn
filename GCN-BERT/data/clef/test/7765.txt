BACKGROUND Skin cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer, accounting for 40% of all new cancer diagnoses and for about 2% of all cancer deaths (1). It is a disease in which cancer (malignant) cells are found in the outer layers of the skin. There are three main types of skin cancer: a) Non-melanoma—common types such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).b) Melanoma—rare type, found in the cells that color the skin (melanocytes).c) Actinic keratosis, pre-malignant skin lesion, often progresses to squamous cell cancer. The incidence of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer appears to be increasing (2, 3), although melanoma incidence rates may have stabilized in the 1990s (4). Epidemiological evidence suggests that aging population, exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the sensitivity of an individual's skin to UV radiation are risk factors for skin cancer, although the type of exposure (high-intensity intermittent versus chronic) and pattern of exposure (continuous versus intermittent) may differ among the three main types of skin cancer (2, 3, 5). Cancer is a disease of inappropriate tissue accumulation. Chemotherapeutic agents share one characteristic: they are usually more effective in killing or damaging malignant cells than normal cells. However the fact that they do harm normal cells indicates their potential for toxicity. Animal tumor investigations and human clinical trials have shown that drug combinations produce higher rates of objective response and longer survival than single agents. Combination drug therapy is therefore, the basis for most chemotherapy employed at present (DeVita, V. T. et al., 1975, Cancer 35:98). Cancer treatment requires inhibitions of a variety of factors including tumor cell proliferation, metastatic dissemination of cancer cells to other parts of the body, invasion, tumor-induced neovascularization, and enhancement of host immunological responses and cytotoxicity. Conventional cancer chemotherapeutic agents have often been selected on the basis of their cytotoxicity to tumor cells. However, some anticancer agents have adverse effects on the patients immune system. Thus, it would be greatly advantageous if a cancer therapy or treatment could be developed that would afford non-cytotoxic protection against factors that might lead to progression of tumors. By virtue of the present invention, it has been discovered that canola extracts can be utilized to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells. Canola is a cruciferous crop which is mainly utilized for its extracted oil. After the oil has been extracted a protein rich meal remains which is used as a ruminant in animal diets. Further extraction of the canola meal yields minor components from canola, including, glucosinolates, phenolic acid esters and phenolic acids.

The canola extracts described therein do not contain more than about 24% sinapic acid content. In addition to their role in the treatment of cancer, canola extracts may also be useful in the treatment of hyperlipidemias. The hyperlipidemias include six types of inheritable hyperlipoproteinemias; these types frequently are referred to as lipoprotein phenotypes. The major plasma lipids, including cholesterol and the triglycerides do not circulate freely in solution in plasma, but are bound to proteins and transported as macromolecular complexes called lipoproteins. The major lipoprotein phenotypes are chylomicrons, very low-density (pre-(β) lipoproteins (VLDL), low-density (β-) lipoproteins (LDL), and high-density (α-) lipoproteins (HDL). Chylomicrons, the largest lipoproteins, carry exogenous glyceride from the intestine via the thoracic duct to adipocytes and muscle cells. VLDL carry endogenous glyceride primarily from the liver to adipocytes and muscle cells. VLDL is the main source of plasma LDL. Classification of inherited hyperlipoproteinemias according to phenotype is important, since dietary management and drug therapy are largely dependent on this information.

EXAMPLE 1 Extraction of CPA (Canola Phenolic Acid) from Canola Meal The extract enriched in total phenolics was isolated from canola meal by homogenization in methanol: water, 70:30, v/v and evaporation of supernatant to dryness. According to HPLC analysis (R. Amarowicz), this extract (Phenolic Extract Saskatoon Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Centre, Apr. 24, 2002) contained 5.3% phenolic acids (Table 1). TABLE 1 Composition of phenolic acids in the extract from canola meal (mg/g) Sinapic Ferulic p-coumaric Caffeic Protocatechuic Esters 50.75 0.56 0.08 0.07 Trace Free 1.03 0.02 0.02 0.03 trace Insoluble- 0.52 0.01 0.06 Trace — bound Total 53.15 mg/g (5.3%) This extract from canola meal had a substantial anti-proliferative activity against human skin cancer cell line SK-MELS in the Alamar Blue assay. The bioactive fraction was subsequently isolated by a large-scale procedure (developed for that purpose), tested again for anti-proliferative activity in SK-MELS cells. IC50 concentrations (concentrations needed to inhibit cell proliferation by 50%)=140 μg/mL (FIG. 1). The CPA extract dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of SK-MEL-5 cells. CPA extract was tested for the antiproliferative activity in cancer cell lines using a vital stain AlamarBlue™ assay. The exponentially growing cells were harvested and seeded in 96-well plates at density 1.5×104 cells/mL. Plates were incubated at 37° C. for 18 hours to allow the cells to attach. The exposure to CPA extracts at various concentrations was initiated by addition of one volume of growth medium (100 μL) containing the extracts at 2 times the desired final concentrations, in triplicate wells. After 4 days of incubation, cell density was determined using AlamarBlue™ and a fluorescence-based plate reader interfaced with a computer. I50 concentrations (concentrations of CPA required to inhibit cell proliferation by 50%) were determined. EXAMPLE 2 In Vitro Analysis To evaluate anticancer activities of CPA, B16-F1 and B16-F10 malignant melanoma tumor cells (10,000) were cultured with CPA (solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO)) at 160, 80, 40 and 20 μg/ml. The cells were incubated for 72 hours in culture in presence or absence of extracts. The cells were cultured at 37° C. in 5% CO2 for 48 and 72 hours. [3H] thymidine was added to the cell cultures, cell proliferation was measured by [3H] thymidine uptake using Micro beta-Scintillation counter. See FIGS. 2A, 2B, 3A and 3B. Preliminary in vitro studies showed that CPA inhibited the proliferation of B16-F1 and B16-F10 malignant melanoma tumor cells for up to 72 hours in culture in a dose dependent manner. EXAMPLE 3 In Vivo Analysis Male C57BL/6 mice (17 wks old) were acclimatized for 4 days. Mice were treated for a week (oral) with CPA followed by injections of B16-F1 malignant melanoma tumor cells (2.0×105) in 100 μl saline subcutaneously in the right hind flank of mice. Mice were monitored for tumor growth for 28 days from the date of injection. a) Effect of CPA Extracts on Development of Melanoma in Mice (Oral Gavage). Mice were given 6.0% CPA w/v of CPA in Canola oil (0.2 ml) by oral gavages daily for additional 4 weeks after tumor cell injection. Tumor Volume: When primary tumours became visible/palpable, their maximum length and width were measured and tumour volume calculated (p<0.04). It was observed that the growth of tumor was similar in mice treated with CPA by oral gavage as compared to the controls up to day 18 of treatment. After day 18, CPA treated group showed a significant reduction in the tumor volume as compared to control suggesting inhibition of tumor growth by CPA. See FIG. 4. Tumor Size: Further, effect of CPA treatment on tumor size was analyzed. When primary tumors became visible/palpable, their maximum length and width were measured at a minimum 3 times weekly using calipers and their tumor sizes were calculated. It was observed that 50% of mice treated with CPA by oral gavage had smaller tumors (0-900) compared to the 20% of vehicle treated (control) mice. The data also showed that 80% of mice from control group had larger tumors compared to CPA treated mice. See FIG. 5. b) Effect of CPA Extracts on Development of Melanoma in Mice (Topical Application). Mice were treated with topical application of 6.0% CPA w/v of CPA in a cream base for an additional 4 weeks after tumor cell injection. Tumor Volume: It was observed that mice treated with CPA by topical application showed similar tumor volume as compared to the controls up to day 14 of treatment. When primary tumors became visible/palpable, their maximum length and width were measured and tumor volume calculated (p<0.01). After day 14 a significant reduction in the tumor volume was observed as compared to control till the end of the study. See FIG. 6. Tumor Size: When primary tumors became visible/palpable, their maximum length and width were measured at a minimum 3 times weekly using calipers and their tumor sizes were calculated. Comparison of tumor sizes between groups showed that mice (30%) treated with CPA by topical application had smaller tumors (0-900) as compared to the control mice. The control group had higher percentage of mice with larger tumors suggesting that topical application of CPA reduces the tumor size. See FIG. 7. Discussion Results from the above experiments show a reduction in tumor volume and size in mice treated with CPA by both oral and topical routes compared to the controls. Although the initial growth of tumors was similar in both the CPA treated and control groups, CPA treatment reduced the tumor volume and size in both the models. These results suggest that supplementation with CPA by both oral and topical routes may have beneficial effects in treating melanoma. Conclusions The above data suggest that CPA has antiproliferative and antineoplastic activity both in vitro and in vivo. It is most effective against human melanoma cells. CPA and its active constituents have the potential to treat melanoma skin cancer in mice. No toxicity was observed in pre-clinical rodent trials. 1.
