This application claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/535,491, filed Jan. 12, 2004, whose disclosure is entirely incorporated by reference herein. FIELD The present invention relates, e.g., to a composition comprising a plurality of nucleic acid probes for use in research and diagnostic applications. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Rectal adenocarcinomas are among the most frequent malignant tumors in the Western World. Surgery, including total mesorectal resection, is the primary treatment for rectal carcinomas. In locally advanced stages of this disease, radiation or combined radiochemotherapy is mandatory. Whether radiochemotherapy should be administered prior to surgery (neoadjuvant) or after resection of the primary tumor (adjuvant), however, is still a matter of controversy (Sauer R. (2002) Pathol Oncol Res 8, 7-17; Pablman at al. (1998) Eur J Cancer; 34, 438-48; Nelson at al. (2001) N Engl J Med 345, 690-2). The decision to administer neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy relies primarily on the depth of tumor infiltration, which, in specialized centers is determined pie-therapeutically by rectal ultrasound (Liersch et al. (2003) Chirurg 74, 224-34; Hunerbein at al. Ann Surg (1997) 225, 432-8; Adams at al. (1999) Dis Colon Rectum 42, 159-66; Glaser et al. (1990) Br J Surg 77, 883-7). Neoadjuvant regimens might be particularly attractive (i) because a priori not curatively resectable tumors can be down-sized to achieve the undisputed benefit of tumor cell free surgical margins (R0-resection), (ii) because preoperative treatment reduces tumor burden and, therefore, might increase the possibility for sphincter preservation, and (iii) because radiochemotherapy cannot be applied when postoperative clinical complications occur. However, the response of individual tumors to radiochemotherapy is not uniform. This poses a considerable clinical dilemma because patients with a priori resistant tumors could be spared exposure to radiation and DNA-damaging drugs, treatments that are associated with substantial side effects. In such cases surgery could be scheduled without delay. Alternatively, different neoadjuvant treatment modalities including additional chemotherapeutics could he pursued. It would therefore be of significant clinical relevance to identify predictive markers of cancer response to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy. Accordingly, numerous groups have employed targeted approaches to correlate expression levels of candidate genes in response to radiation, different chemotherapeutic drugs, and combinations of radiation and chemotherapy (for review see Pasche at al. (2002) Best Pract Res Clin Gastroenterol 16, 331-45; Adlard et al. (2002) Lancet Oncol 3, 75-82). The selections of candidate genes primarily included genes required for drug metabolism, drug activation, drug resistance, and DNA damage repair, and oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes involved in cell cycle control. Unfortunately, these candidate gene approaches have not materialized into sound pre-therapeutic predictors of response to radiochemotherapy. See, e.g., Okonkwo at al. (2001) Oncol Rep 8, 497-500; Saw et al (2003) Dis Colon Rectum 46, 192-202; Spitz at al. (1997) Clin Cancer Res 3, 1685-90; Luna-Perez at al. (1998) Ann Surg Oncol 5, 203-8; Elsaleb et al. (2000) Radiother Oncol 56, 239-44; Diez et al (2003) Oncology 64, 213-9; Scott at al. (1998) Eur J Surg Oncol 24, 169-73. There remains a need to establish reliable, clinically useful, predictors of radiochemosensitivity of rectal adenocarcinomas. Parallel profiling of global gene expression levels based on microarray technologies has emerged as a powerful tool to monitor the transcriptome of cancer cells for tumor classification and prognosis (Rosenwald et at (2002) N Engl Med 346, 1937-47; van't Veer at al. (2002) Nature 415, 530-6; Iizuka et al. (2003) Lancet 361, 923-9; Bertucci at al. (2001) Lancet Oncol 2, 674-82; Yeoh et al (2002) Cancer Cell 1, 133-43). In addition, the power of gene expression profiling as a predictor of drug response has been explored in several model systems, including the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel (Staunton at al. (2001) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 98, 10787-92; Scherf et al. (2000) Nat Genet 24, 236-44) and tumor xenografts (Zembutsu et al (2002) Cancer Res 62, 518-27). The results of these studies provide evidence that at least for some tumors and a subset of drugs, pre-therapeutic gene expression profiles might predict treatment response. The present inventors have analyzed gene expression profiles of rectal adenocarcinomas, and have identified genes whose expression is correlated with responsiveness of the tumors to radiochemotherapy (e.g., neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy). Combinations comprising probes specific for these genes can be used in, diagnostic and experimental methods. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a pictorial presentation of specimen accrual, clinical diagnosis, and experimental design. cUICC refers to pre-therapeutic clinical staging of tumors based on rectal ultrasound and computed tomography. ypUICC refers to histological assessment of the resected specimen after neoadjuvant therapy. FIG. 2 shows a hierarchical cluster analysis of 23 patients based on the 54 most significantly changed genes (p<0.001) when using T-level-down-sizing. Note that in this cluster analysis, all but one patient (P15) were correctly assigned to the group of non-responders (13 patients on the left), while the 10 patients on the right were grouped as responders. Gene symbols and fold change between the groups are listed to the right. Values<1 reflect down-regulation (white) in the class of responders, whereas values>1 reflect up-regulation (grey). DESCRIPTION OF Tap INVENTION The present invention relates, e.g., to the identification of genes and gene products (molecular markers, molecular signatures) from rectal adenocarcinomas whose expression, compared to a baseline value, is correlated with the responsiveness of the tumors to radiochemotherapy. As used herein, a “baseline value” includes, e.g., the expression in normal tissue, such as normal rectal tissue, e.g. from the subject or from a “pool” of normal subjects; or from a pool of different tissues from normal subjects. In a preferred embodiment, the expression is from a pool of cell lines (e.g. of carcinogenic origin), such as the universal human reference library available from Stratagene (catalogue no. 740000). The pooled values may be either commercially available or otherwise derived. Alternatively, the baseline value may be the expression in rectal carcinomas that are known to be “non-responders” to radiochemotherapy, e.g. the average value from a pool or compilation of such tumor samples. The baseline value may be available in a database compiled from any of such values. About 54 molecular markers are identified herein that are expressed in a significantly altered amount in rectal carcinomas that are responsive to radiochemotherapy, compared to rectal adenocarcinomas that are not responsive. Of the 54 molecular markers, 13 are up-regulated, and 41 are down-regulated, in responders compared to non-responders. Of course, other genes, as well, may be differentially regulated in responders compared to non-responders. These molecular markers can serve as the basis for diagnostic assays to determine the responsiveness of a rectal carcinoma to radiochemotherapy. For example, nucleic acid probes corresponding to one or more of the genes, and/or antibodies specific for proteins encoded by the genes, can be used to analyze a sample from a rectal tumor, in order to determine the responsiveness. Molecules (e.g. nucleic acid probes, antibodies, etc) corresponding to any number of the 54 identified genes, in any combination or permutation, can be used in compositions and methods of the invention. The genes and gene products can also aid in the identification of therapeutic agents, e.g. agents which can be administered in conjunction with radiochemotherapy, and which enhance the responsiveness of a rectal tumor to the radiochemotherapy. Furthermore, the identification of genes whose expression is correlated with responsiveness to radiochemotherapy can also provide a basis for explaining the different metabolic processes involved in such responsiveness, and thus can be used as research tools. One aspect of the invention is a composition (combination) comprising one or a plurality of (preferably at least about 5, at least about 10, or at least about 15) isolated nucleic acids of at least about 8 contiguous nucleotides (e.g., at least about 12, 15, 25, 35, 50 or 75 contiguous nucleotides), selected from nucleic acids that correspond to genes 1-54 from Table 3, and comprising no more than about 1×106 (e.g., no more than about 500,000; 200,000; 100,000; 50,000; 25,000; 14,000; 13000; 12,000; 11,000; 10,000; 9,000; 8,000; 7,000; 6,000; 5,000, 4,000; 3,000; 2,000; 1,000; 500; 250; 150; 70 or 50) total isolated nucleic acids. In embodiments of the invention, the composition comprises at least about 5 (e.g., at least about 10, 15, 25, 50, 54, 60, 70 or 100 or more) nucleic acids that correspond to genes 1-54 from Table 3. In embodiments of the invention, at least one of the nucleic acids that correspond to genes 1-54 contains at least about 50 contiguous nucleotides, and'or is a eDNA. For example, the nucleic acids corresponding to genes 1-54 of Table 3 may be selected from: (a) nucleic acids that comprise the sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 1-58 or 113-123; (b) nucleic acids that comprise sequences that are at least about 85% (e.g., at least about 90%, 95%, or 98%) identical to the sequences of SEQ 1D NOs: 1-58 or 113-123; (c) nucleic acids that comprise sequences encoding polypeptides represented by SEQ ID NOs: 59-112; (d) nucleic acids that comprise sequences of active fragments of the nucleic acids of (a), (b), or (c); (e) nucleic acids that comprise sequences of active variants of the nucleic acids of (a), (b), or (c) and/or (f) nucleic acids that comprise complete complements of the sequences of any of the nucleic acids (a)-(e); wherein the nucleic acids hybridize under conditions of high stringency to nucleic acids represented by SEQ ID NOs: 1-58 or 113-123, or to complements thereof. The composition may be used, e.g., to determine the responsiveness of a rectal adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy. As used herein, a “plurality” refers to two or more members, more preferably to a group of at least about 2, or at least about 5, or at least about 15, or at least about 54, etc., of the identified molecular markers. As used herein, the term “isolated” nucleic acid (or polypeptide, or antibody) refers to a nucleic acid (or polypeptide, or antibody) that is in a form other than it occurs in nature, for example in a buffer, in a dry form awaiting reconstitution, as part of an array, a kit or a pharmaceutical composition, etc. The term an “isolated” nucleic acid or protein does not include a cell extract (e.g., a crude or semi-purified cell extract). The majority of rectal tumors are carcinomas, and the majority of these rectal carcinomas are adenocarcinomas. The terms rectal tumor, carcinoma and adenocarcinoma are sometimes used interchangeably herein, with the understanding that the rectal tumors being discussed are preferably rectal adenocarcinomas. (It is noted that adenocarcinomas located in tissues other than the rectum may, under certain circumstances, also exhibit expression patterns similar to those discussed herein, with regard to responsiveness to radiochemotherapy.) A rectal adenocarcinoma that is “responsive to” radiochemotherapy is a tumor that is measurably more sensitive to such treatment than is a “non-responsive” tumor. The range of responsiveness of a responsive tumor may range widely. For example, in some cases, a responsive tumor may melt away, whereas in other cases, the reduction in size is not more than about 10%. Criteria for measuring responsiveness are known to skilled workers; some criteria are provided in the Examples. The individual sequences of nucleic acids and proteins in the compositions and methods of the invention were publicly available at the time the invention was made. However, the relationship between expression of these sequences and the responsiveness of rectal adenocarcinomas to radiochemotherapy had not previously been observed; and the particular combinations of sequences in the compositions of the invention had not been disclosed or suggested. The GenBank accession numbers and the sequences of some representative nucleic acids and proteins corresponding to genes 1-54 are provided in Table 3 (in Example II) and in the Sequence Listing attached hereto. Nucleic acids or proteins that “correspond to” a gene include nucleic acids or proteins that are expressed by the gene, or active fragments or variants of the expressed nucleic acids or proteins, or complements of the nucleic acids or fragments, etc. Only one strand of each nucleic acid is shown, but the complementary strand is understood to be included by any reference to the displayed strand. A “complement,” as used herein, is a complete (full-length) complementary strand (with no mismatches) of a single strand nucleic acid. As is discussed more fully below, probes from NCI-cDNA arrays (e.g., probes obtained from Incyte) were used in the experiments described herein to identify the 54 molecular markers of the invention. Some of those probes represent full-length coding sequences, and others (e,g,, probes corresponding to genes 3, 6, 14, 19, 28, 30, 32, 44, 45, 48 and 51) are less than full-length. Full-length nucleic acid sequences (e.g., full-length coding sequences or genomic sequences) that correspond to the less than full-length probes were obtained, using conventional methods to mine Genbank sequences. Both full-length and less than full-length sequences are listed in Table. 3. Full-length SEQ ID NOs are listed in the first column of the table; and less than full-length coding sequences in the third column. The SEQ ID NOs listed in the second column of the table in general represent full length proteins. No protein sequences are listed for some of the short EST s (e.g., genes 6, 28, 45 and 51); however, a skilled worker can readily identify open reading frames in these nucleic acid sequences and thus identify the corresponding protein sequences. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acids corresponding to genes 1-54 of Table 3 are selected from the fifteen genes whose expression is most highly correlated in the study discussed herein with responsiveness of the tumors to radiochemotherapy [genes 1-12 (represented, e.g., by the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 1-15 and 113-114) and genes 42-44 (represented, e.g., by the nucleotide sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 46-48 and 120)]. That is, the nucleic acids in the composition (each having at least about 15 contiguous nucleotides) that correspond to genes in Table 3 may be selected from: (a) nucleic acids that comprise sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 1-15, 113-114, 46-48, or 120; (b) nucleic acids that comprise sequences that are at least about 85% (e.g., at least about 90%, 95%, or 98%) identical to SEQ ID NOs: 1-15, 113-114, 46-48, or 120; (c) nucleic acids that comprise sequences encoding polypeptides represented by SEQ NOs 59-72 or 102-104; (d) nucleic acids that comprise sequences of active fragments of the nucleic acids of (a), (b), or (c); (e) nucleic acids that comprise sequences of active variants of the nucleic acids of (a), (b), or (c); and/or (f) nucleic acids that comprise complete complements of any of the sequences of nucleic acids (a)-(e); wherein the nucleic acids hybridize under conditions of high stringency to nucleic acids represented by SEQ ID NOs: 11-15, 113-114, 46-48, or 120, or to complements thereof. The nucleic acids discussed above, arid derivatives thereof; can be used as probes to identify (e.g., by hybridization assays) polynucleotides whose expression is altered, compared to a baseline value, in rectal adenocarcinomas that are responsive to radiochemotherapy. As noted, some of the SEQ ID NOs represent full-length cDNAs, and others represent cDNAs or ESTs that are partial copies of gene coding sequences. The invention includes fragments containing sequential nucleotides of the partial or full-length cDNA s; preferably, these fragments are at least about 8, or at least about 15, nucleotides in length, and are specific for the genes from which the corresponding cDNAs were obtained. As discussed in more detail below, skilled workers will recognize how to select suitable fragments of a given nucleic acid that will hybridize specifically to a polynucleotide of interest. Compositions of the invention may comprise any combination of, e.g., at least about 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 55, 60, 75 or 100 or more of the mentioned nucleic acids and/or fragments that correspond to genes from Table 3. A nucleic acid composition of the invention may comprise, consist essentially of; or consist of, a total of, e.g., about 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 60, 70, 100, 150, 250, 500, 750, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 5,000, 7,000; 8,000; 9,000; 10,000, 11,000; 12,000; 13,000; 14,000; 15,000; 25,000, 50,000, 100,000, 200,000, 500,000, 1×106, or more isolated nucleic acids. The term “consisting essentially of,” in this context, refers to a value intermediate between the specific number of the mentioned elements (here, nucleic acids) encompassed by the term “consisting of” and the large number encompassed by the term “comprising.” A nucleic acid composition of the invention preferably comprises no more than a total of, e.g., about 1×105 (e.g., no more than about 500,000; 200,000; 100,000; 50,000; 25,000; 14,000; 13,000; 12,000; 11,000; 10,000; 9,000; 8,000; 7,000; 6,000; 5,000, 4,000; 3,000; 2,000; 1,000; 750; 500; 250; 150; 100; 70; 60; 50; 25; 20; 15; 10; 5; 2; or 1) isolated nucleic acids. Another embodiment of the invention is a composition of nucleic acids or fragments which hybridize specifically under conditions of high stringency to nucleic acids from the set represented by the SEQ ID NOs corresponding to genes 1-54 (e.g. SEQ NOs: 1-58 and 113-123), or to complements thereof. The nucleic acid compositions of the invention may be in the form of an aqueous solution (e.g., for use in solution hybridization), or the nucleic acids in the composition may be immobilized on a substrate. In some compositions of the invention, the isolated nucleic acids are in an array or a microarray, e.g., they are hybridizable elements on an array, such as a microarray. A nucleic acid array may further comprise, bound (e.g., bound specifically) to one or more nucleic acids of the array, polynucleotides from a sample representing expressed genes. In general, as used herein, the term “nucleic acid” refers to a probe, whereas the term “polynucleotide” refers to an expression product of a gene, or a derivative of such an expression product. The sample may be, e.g., from an individual subject's rectal adenocarcinoma; from a normal tissue, such as a normal rectal tissue; from a tissue known to be non-responsive or known to be responsive to radiochemotherapy; or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the nucleic acids in an array and the polynucleotides from a sample representing expressed genes have been subjected to nucleic acid hybridization under high stringency conditions (such that nucleic acids of the array that are specific for particular polynucleotides from the sample are specifically hybridized to those polynucleotides). In the nucleic acid compositions of the invention, at least one phosphate, sugar and/or base moiety in the helix may be modified. For example, a phosphate may be modified as a phosphorothioate, a phosphoridothioate, a phosphoramidothioate, a phosphoramidate, a phosphordiimidate, a methylphosphonate, an alkyl phosphotriester, 3′-aminopropyl, a formacetal, or an analogue thereof. Another embodiment is a composition comprising one or a plurality of (e.g., at least about 5, 10 or 15) isolated nucleic acids, each of which hybridizes specifically under high stringency conditions to part or all of a coding sequence whose expression reflects (is indicative of is correlated with) responsiveness of a rectal adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy. Examples of some such nucleic acids are nucleic acids corresponding to genes 1-54, as discussed above (e.g., nucleic acids represented by SEQ m NOs: 1-58 or 113-123, or active fragments, variants, or complements thereat). Sequences “corresponding to” a gene, or “specific for” a gene include sequences that are substantially similar to (e.g., hybridize under conditions of high stringency to) one of the strands of the double stranded form of that gene. By hybridizing “specifically” is meant herein that two components (e.g. an expressed gene or polynucleotide and a nucleic acid probe) bind selectively to each other and not generally to other components unintended' for binding to the subject components. The parameters required to achieve specific interactions can be determined routinely, using conventional methods in the art. Another aspect of the invention is a composition (combination) comprising polypeptides that are of a size and structure that can be recognized and/or bound by an antibody. That is, the polypeptides are antigenic. Specifically, the composition comprises one or a plurality of (e,g., at least about 5, 10 or 15) isolated, antigenic polypeptides selected from polypeptides that correspond to genes 1-54 from Table 3. For example, the composition may comprise polypeptides selected from: (a) polypeptides comprising SEQ ID NOs: 59-112; (b) polypeptides encoded by polynucleotides comprising SEQ ID NOs: 1-58 or 113-123; (c) polypeptides whose sequences are at least about 85% (e.g., at least about 90%, 95%, or 98%) identical to SEQ ID NOs: 59-112; (d) active variants of (a), (b) or (c); and/or (e) antigenic fragments of (a), (b) or (c), wherein the polypeptides, active variants or antigenic fragments are of a size and structure that can be recognized, or bound by, an antibody. In a preferred embodiment, the polypeptides in the above composition that correspond to genes from Table 3 are selected from the fifteen polypeptides whose expression is most highly correlated in the study discussed herein with responsiveness of the tumors to radiochemotherapy [genes 1-12 (represented, e.g., by the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs 59-72) and genes 42-44 (represented, e.g., by the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NOs: 102-104)]. That is, the composition may comprise polypeptides selected from: (a) polypeptides comprising SEQ ID NOs: 59-72 or 102-104; (b) polypeptides encoded by polynucleotides comprising SEQ ID NOs: 1-15, 113-114, 46-48 or 120); (c) polypeptides whose sequences are at least about 85% (e.g., at least about 90%, 95%, or 98%) identical to SEQ ID NOs: 59-72 or 102-104; (d) active variants of (a), (b), or (c); and/or (e) antigenic fragments of (a), (b), or (c), wherein the polypeptides, active variants or antigenic fragments are of a size and structure that can be recognized and/or bound by an antibody. One use of such compositions of polypeptides of the invention is as a source for generating antibodies that can be used to detect the responsiveness of a rectal adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy. A composition of polypeptides of the invention may comprise any combination of, e.g., at least about 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, 55, 60, 75, 100 or more of the mentioned isolated polypeptides, variants or fragments that correspond to genes from Table 3. A polypeptide composition of the invention may comprise, consist essentially of or consist of e.g., at least about 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 25, 50, 75, 100, 200, 500, 750, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 5,000, 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, 100,000, 200,000, 500,000, 1×106, 5×106 or more total isolated polypeptides. Another embodiment is a composition comprising one or a plurality of (e.g., at least about 5, 10 or 15) isolated, antigenic, polypeptides for use in generating antibodies for detecting the response of a rectal adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy, wherein said polypeptides are polypeptides whose expression is correlated with responsiveness of the adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy. Another aspect of the invention is a composition comprising antibodies specific for the polypeptides of the invention. As used herein, an antibody that is “specific for” a polypeptide includes an antibody that binds selectively to the polypeptide and not generally to other polypeptides unintended for binding to the antibody. The parameters required to achieve such specificity can be determined routinely, using conventional methods in the art. One embodiment of the invention is a composition comprising selected numbers of such antibodies, which are in a form that permits their binding to the polypeptides for which they are specific. Specifically, the composition comprises one or a plurality of isolated antibodies (preferably at least about 5, 10 or 15 isolated antibodies), which are selected from antibodies that are specific for polypeptides corresponding to genes 1-54 from Table 3. Preferably, the antibodies are specific for polypeptides corresponding to genes 1-12 or 42-44 from Table 3. For example, the antibodies may be specific for polypeptides selected from: (a) polypeptides comprising SEQ ID NOs: 59-112 (particularly SEQ ID NOs: 59-72 or 102-104); (b) polypeptides encoded by polynucleotides comprising SEQ ID NOs: 1-58 or 113-123 (particularly SEQ ID NOs: 1-15, 46-48, 113-114, or 120); (c) polypeptides that are at least about 85% (e.g., at least about 90%, 95%, or 98%) identical to SEQ ID NOs: 59-112 (particularly to SEQ ID NOs: 59-72 or 102-104); (d) polypeptides that are active variants of (a), (b), or (c); and/or (e) polypeptides that are antigenic fragments of (a), (b) or (c). Generally, the antigenic fragments comprise at least about 8 or at least about 12 contiguous amino acids of said polypeptide sequences. The antibody compositions of the invention may be used, e.g., to determine the responsiveness of a rectal adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy. The above compositions may comprise any combination of, e.g., at least about 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 or more of the mentioned isolated antibodies or antibody fragments specific for genes that correspond to genes from Table 3. An antibody composition of the invention may comprise, consist essentially of, or consist of a total of, e.g., at least about 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50, 60, 70, 100, 125, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 750, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 5,000, 7,000; 8,000; 9,000; 10,000, 11,000; 12,000; 13,000; 14,000; 15,000; 25,000, 50,000, 100,000, 200,000, 500,000, 1×106 or more isolated antibodies. In embodiments of the invention, the composition comprises no more than about 1,000 (e.g., no more than about 500,000; 200,000; 100,000; 50,000; 25,000; 14,000; 13,000; 12,000; 11,000; 10,000; 9,000; 8,000; 7,000; 6,000; 5,000, 4,000; 3,000; 2,000; 1,000; 750; 500; 400; 300; 250; 200; 150; 125; 100; 70; 60; 50; 25; 20; 15; 10; 5; 2; or 1) total isolated antibodies. The isolated antibodies in any of the above compositions may be in the form of an aqueous solution (e.g., in a form suitable for radioimmunoassay), or the isolated antibodies may be immobilized on a substrate. In embodiments of the invention, the isolated antibodies are in an array, e.g., a microarray; they may be reactive elements on an array, such as a microarray. By “reactive” elements is meant that the antibodies can react, e.g., bind, in a specific manner, with antigens for which they are specific. Another aspect of the invention is a method for detecting (e.g., measuring, or quantitating) one or more polynucleotides or polypeptides of the invention in a sample, such as a sample from a rectal adenocarcinoma, compared to a baseline value. Generally, the detected polynucleotides or polypeptides correspond to a gene whose expression is correlated with responsiveness of the tumor to radiochemotherapy (e.g., genes 1-54 from Table 3). The method is generally a method for determining the responsiveness of the rectal adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy. In one embodiment, this method involves contacting the sample with a composition of nucleic acids, or of antibodies, of the invention, under conditions effective for specific binding of the nucleic acids to the polynucleotides in the sample (such as hybridization under conditions of high stringency), or effective for specific binding of the antibodies to the polypeptides in the sample. The method may further comprise detecting (e.g., determining the amount of) the polynucleotides in the sample which have bound to the nucleic acids, or detecting (e.g., determining the amount of) the polypeptides in the sample which have bound to the antibodies. Preferably, the polynucleotides or polypeptides that are detected reflect expression (either up-regulation or down-regulation) that is correlated with (indicative of) responsiveness of the adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy. For example, a decrease in the amount (level of expression) of one or more of set #1 of 41 polynucleotides or polypeptides in a sample indicates that the adenocarcinoma is responsive to radiochemotherapy. Set #1 comprises nucleic acids corresponding to genes 1-41 (e.g., nucleic acids that comprise SEQ ID NOs: 145 or 113-119, or that can hybridize specifically (e.g., under conditions of high stringency) to those nucleic acids, or that are complements of those nucleic acids, etc.); and the corresponding polypeptides, which comprise sequences corresponding to genes 1-41 (e.g., polypeptides comprising SEQ ID NOs: 59-102, etc.). An increase in the amount (level of expression) of one or more of set #2 of 13 polynucleotides or polypeptides in a sample indicates that the adenocarcinoma is responsive to radiochemotherapy. Set #2 comprises nucleic acids corresponding to genes 42-54 (e.g., nucleic acids that comprise SEQ ID NOs: 46-58 or 120-123, or that can hybridize specifically (e.g., under conditions of high stringency) to those nucleic acids, or that are complements of those nucleic acids, etc.); and the corresponding polypeptides, which comprise sequences corresponding to genes 42-54 (e.g., polypeptides comprising SEQ ID NOs: 102-112, etc.). In assays described herein, a given polynucleotide or polypeptide may or may not be expressed in an increased or decreased amount in a sample from a rectal adenocarcinoma, compared to a baseline value. In a general sense, this invention relates to methods to determine if a gene product is expressed in an increased or decreased amount, irrespective of whether such increased or decreased expression is detected. The rectal adenocarcinoma evaluated in this method is preferably from a human patient. The patient may not have been subjected to surgery, such as rectal resection, i.e., the patient is preoperative. In this case, the method can provide information as to Whether preadjuvant therapy is advisable. Alternatively, the patient may have already been subjected to surgery, such as rectal resection, i.e., the patient is postoperative. In this case, the method can provide information as to whether adjuvant therapy is advisable. In one embodiment, the method comprises determining in a polynucleotide sample which represents expressed genes in a rectal adenocarcinoma the amount (level of expression), compared to a baseline value, of one or a plurality of (e.g., at least about 5, 10 or 15) polynucleotides whose expression is correlated with the responsiveness of the adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy. For example, the expression of genes selected from genes 1-54 of Table 3 can be measured. As used herein, the term “polynucleotide” sample in general refers to expression products of genes, such as mRNA, or derivatives of such expression products, such as, e.g., cRNA, cDNA, or PCR amplification products. The term “nucleic acid” generally refers to a nucleic acid used as a probe to detect such polynucleotides. In one embodiment of this method, each of the polynucleotides can hybridize specifically (e.g., under conditions of high stringency) to one of the nucleic acids noted above. For example, the nucleic acids may be selected from nucleic acids comprising SEQ ID NOs: 1-58 or 113-123 (in particular, SEQ ID NOs: 1-15, 46-48, 113-114, or 120), and/or the mentioned fragments or variants thereof (e.g., nucleic acids that are at least about 90%, 95% or 98% identical to those SEQ ID NOs; nucleic acids that encode polypeptides represented by SEQ ID NOs: 59-112 (in particular, SEQ ID NOs: 59-72 or 102-104); active fragments that comprise at least about 8 to 15 contiguous nucleotides of any of those nucleic acids; active variants of any of those nucleic acids; or complements of any of the above nucleic acids). In embodiments of this method, the amount (level of expression) of at least about 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, or 54 of the polynucleotides corresponding to genes 1-54 from Table 3 is determined, In one embodiment of the method, the amount (level of expression) of polynucleotides in a sample is determined by hybridizing polynucleotides in the sample to a nucleic acid composition of the invention, under conditions of high stringency, and comparing the amount of hybridization to a baseline value. In embodiments of this method, the nucleic acids are immobilized on a substrate, and/or are in an array, e.g. are hybridizable elements on an array, such as a microarray. The amount of hybridization of a polynucleotide in the sample to a nucleic acid specific for it in the nucleic acid composition generally reflects the level of expression of the polynucleotide in the rectal adenocarcinoma. The baseline value may be obtained, for example, by hybridizing a nucleic acid composition of the invention, under conditions of high stringency, to a control polynucleotide sample. For example, one can use a polynucleotide sample obtained from normal tissue, such as a normal rectal tissue, e.g. from the subject or from a “pool” of normal subjects; or to a polynucleotide obtained from a pool of different tissues of normal subjects. In a preferred embodiment, one uses a pool of cell lines of carcinogenic origin, such as the universal human reference library available from Stratagene (catalogue no. 740000). The pooled values may be either commercially available or otherwise derived. Alternatively, the baseline value may be the expression in rectal carcinomas that are known to be “non-responders” to radiochemotherapy, e.g., the average value from a pool or compilation of such tumor samples. Any of the above types of baseline values may available in a database compiled from such values. In another embodiment of this method, the determination of the amount (level of expression) of polynucleotides in a sample is performed by quantitatively amplifying polynucleotides in the rectal adenocarcinoma sample with primers specific for those polynucleotides, and comparing the amount of amplified polynucleotide to a baseline value. For example, conventional methods of RT-PCR may be used. In one embodiment, the polynucleotides from the rectal adenocarcinoma sample (and, optionally, from controls) are labeled with a detectable label, e.g., a fluorescent label. In another embodiment, the method comprises determining in a polypeptide sample from a rectal adenocarcinoma the amount (level of expression), compared to the amount (level of expression) of a baseline value, of each of one or a plurality of polypeptides whose expression is correlated with the responsiveness of the adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy (e.g., polypeptides corresponding to genes 1-54 of Table 3). The polypeptides may be selected from polypeptides that bind specifically to antibodies specific for polypeptides: (a) comprising SEQ ID NOs: 59-112 (particularly SEQ ID NOs; 59-72 or 102-104); (b) encoded by polynucleotides comprising SEQ ID NOs: 1-58 and 113-123 (particularly SEQ ID NOs: 1-15, 46-48, 113-114, and 120); (c) whose sequences are at least about 85% (e.g., at least about 90%, 95%, or 98%) identical to SEQ ID NOs: 59-112 (particularly to SEQ ID NOs: 59-72 and 102-104); (d) that are active variants of (a), (b), or (c); and/or (e) that are antigenic fragments of (a), (b) or (c). An altered amount (level of expression) of one or more of the polypeptides compared to a baseline value is correlated with the responsiveness of the rectal adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy. In embodiments of the invention, the amount of at least about 1, 2, 5, 10, 50 or 54 of the polypeptides is determined. In one embodiment of this method, the determination is performed by: contacting said polypeptide sample with an antibody composition containing one or a plurality of antibodies specific for polypeptides comprising polypeptides (a), (b), (c), (d) and/or (e) above, under conditions effective for at least one of said antibodies to bind specifically to the corresponding polypeptide (polypeptide for which it is specific), and comparing the amount (degree) of specific binding of to a baseline value. The antibody composition may be in the fern of an aqueous solution; the antibodies may be immobilized on a substrate or surface (e.g., a surface suitable for surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based technology); and/or the antibodies may be in an array, e.g. they may be reactive elements on an array, such as a microarray. The amount of binding of a polypeptide in the sample to an antibody specific for it in the antibody composition generally reflects the amount (level of expression) of the polypeptide in the rectal adenocarcinoma. The baseline value may reflect the amount of the polypeptides expressed in nomad tissue. For example, it may he obtained by contacting the antibody composition, under conditions as above, to a polypeptide sample obtained from normal rectal tissue, e.g., from the subject or a reference “pool” of normal subjects; or to a polypeptide sample obtained from a pool of different tissues of normal subjects. In a preferred embodiment, one uses a pool of cell lines of carcinogenic origin, such as the universal human reference library available from Stratagene (catalogue no. 740000). The pooled values may be either commercially available or otherwise derived. Alternatively, the baseline value may be determined with rectal carcinomas that are known to be “non-responders” to radiochemotherapy, e.g., the average value from a pool or compilation of such tumor samples. Any of the above types of baseline values may available in a compiled database. Another aspect of the invention is a kit (e.g. for detecting the presence and/or amount of a polynucleotide in a sample from a rectal adenocarcinoma, which may indicate that the rectal adenocarcinoma is responsive to radiochemotherapy), comprising a composition of nucleic acids of the invention (e.g., in the form of an array) and, optionally, one or more reagents that facilitate hybridization of the nucleic acids in the composition to a test polynucleotide(s) of interest, and/or that facilitate detection of the hybridized polynucleotide(s), e.g., that facilitate detection of fluorescence. The kit may comprise a composition of nucleic acids of the invention (e.g., in the form of an array), means for carrying out hybridization of the nucleic acids in the composition to a test polynucleotide(s) of interest, and/or for means for reading hybridization results. Hybridization results may be units of fluorescence. Another aspect is a kit (e.g. for detecting the presence and/or amount of a polypeptide in a sample from a rectal adenocarcinoma, which may indicate that the rectal adenocarcinoma is responsive to radiochemotherapy), comprising a composition of antibodies of the invention (e.g., in the form of an array) and, optionally, one or more reagents that facilitate binding of the antibodies in the composition with a test polypeptide(s) of interest, or that facilitate detection of bound antibody. The kit may comprise a composition of antibodies of the invention (e.g., in the form of an array), means for carrying out binding of the antibodies in the array to a test polynucleotide(s) of interest, and/or means for reading the binding results. Another aspect of the invention is a method for identifying a candidate for an agent (e.g., a drug) that enhances (e.g., facilitates, increases, potentiates) the response of a rectal adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy. Such an agent would be particularly valuable if administered to a patient in conjunction with radiochemotherapy. One embodiment of this method comprises (a) contacting a rectal adenocarcinoma cell with a putative agent; (b) hybridizing a sample of polynucleotides representing expressed genes obtained from the contacted adenocarcinoma cell to a nucleic acid composition of the invention, under conditions effective for specific hybridization of a nucleic acid probe of the invention to its corresponding polynucleotide target (e.g., under high stringency hybridization conditions); and (c) determining the amount (level of) of specific hybridization of one or more of the polynucleotides in the sample to one or more of the nucleic acids in the composition, compared to the amount in the absence of the putative agent, wherein the amount of specific hybridization of a polynucleotide reflects the amount (level) of its expression in the contacted adenocarcinoma cell, and wherein a putative agent that reduces the expression of one or more polynucleotides of the invention corresponding to genes 1-41, or that enhances the expression of one or more polynucleotides of the invention corresponding to genes 42-54, compared to the amount in the absence of the putative agent, is a candidate for an agent that enhances the response of a rectal adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy. The method may further comprise assessing the ability of the candidate agent to enhance responsiveness of an adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy in viva. Another aspect of the invention is a method for identifying a candidate for an agent (e.g., a drug) that enhances the response of a rectal adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy, comprising, (a) contacting a rectal adenocarcinoma cell with a putative agent; (b) contacting a sample of polypeptides obtained from the contacted adenocarcinoma cell with an antibody composition of the invention, under conditions effective for specific binding of an antibody to its corresponding polypeptide; and (c) determining the amount (level of) of specific binding of one of more of the polypeptides in the sample to one of more of the antibodies of the composition, compared to the amount in the absence of the putative agent, wherein the amount of specific binding of a polypeptide reflects the amount (level) of its expression in the contacted adenocarcinoma, and wherein a putative agent that reduces the expression of one or more polypeptides of the invention corresponding to genes 1-41, or that enhances the expression of one or more polynucleotides of the invention corresponding to genes 42-54, compared to the amount in the absence of the putative agent, is a candidate for an agent that enhances the response of a rectal adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy. The method may further comprise assessing the ability of the candidate agent to enhance responsiveness of an adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy in viva, Another aspect of the invention is a method for identifying target genes for therapy of rectal adenocarcinoma. One embodiment is a method for identifying a gene whose inhibition (of expression or activity) enhances the response of a rectal adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy, comprising (a) inhibiting in a rectal adenocarcinoma the expression and/or activity of a gene selected from genes 1 through 41, or the expression and/or activity of a gene product of one of those genes; and (b) determining if the rectal tumor exhibits an increased response to radiochemotherapy compared to a baseline value. Another embodiment is a method for identifying a gene whose stimulation (of expression or activity) enhances the response of a rectal adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy, comprising (a) stimulating in a rectal adenocarcinoma the expression and/or activity of a gene selected from genes 42 through 54, or the expression and/or activity of a gene product of one of those genes; and (b) determining if the rectal tumor exhibits an increased response to radiochemotherapy compared to a baseline value. In the present application, the term “nucleic acid” (e.g., with reference to probe molecules) refers both to DNA (including cDNA) and RNA, as well as DNA-like or RNA-like materials, such as branched DNAs, peptide nucleic acids (PNA) or locked nucleic acids (LNA). Nucleic acid probes for gene expression analysis include those comprising ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides, both, and/or their analogues. Nucleic acids of the invention include double stranded and partially or completely single stranded molecules. In a preferred embodiment, probes for gene expression comprise single stranded nucleic acid molecules that are complementary to an mRNA target expressed by a gene of interest, or that are complementary to the opposite strand (e.g., complementary to a first strand cDNA generated from the mRNA). Several nucleic acid probe sequences described herein are cDNAs complementary to genes or gene fragments; some are ESTs. For purposes of the analysis, it is not necessary that the Pall length sequence be known, as those of skill in the art will know how to obtain the full length sequence using the sequence of a given fragment or EST and known data mining, bioinformatic, and DNA sequencing methodologies without undue experimentation. If desired, the skilled artisan can subsequently select as a probe a nucleic acid that is longer than the initial gene fragment or EST, or a suitable fragment selected from that extended sequence. Many full length sequences (e.g., full-length coding sequences or genomic sequences) have been determined from less than full-length sequences used in the experiments described herein; these full length sequences are provided in Table 3, Again, a skilled worker can readily select suitable probe sequences, corresponding to coding sequences, using conventional procedures. Since some of the probe sequences are identified solely based on expression levels, it is not essential to know a priori the function of a particular gene. The present invention includes a variety of active variants of nucleic acids. For example, nucleic acid probes can be sequence variants of the sequences described herein (e.g., they can include nucleotide substitutions, small insertions or deletions, nucleotide analogues, etc.); or they can be chemical variants (e.g., they can contain chemical derivatives); or they can be length variants. An “active variant,” as used herein, is a variant that retains a measurable amount of an activity of the starting material. For example, an active variant of a nucleic acid probe retains an adequate ability to hybridize specifically to a complementary DNA strand (or mRNA) in a test sample. Preferably, an active variant of a nucleic acid probe also exhibits adequate resistance to nucleases and stability in the hybridization protocols employed. DNA or RNA may be made more resistant to nuclease degradation, e.g., by incorporating modified nucleosides (e.g., 2′-O-methylribose or 1′-α-anomers), or by modifying internucleoside linkages (e.g., methylphosphonates or phosphorothioates), as described below. With regard to sequence variants, the invention includes nucleic acid probes which exhibit variations in sequence compared to the wild type sequence, provided the probe retains the ability to hybridize specifically to the polynucleotide to which it corresponds (e.g., to the nucleic acid from which it is derived, or a complement thereof). For example, small deletions, insertions, substitutions, rearrangements etc. are tolerated. The sequence changes may be introduced artificially, or they may be naturally occurring, e.g., changes reflecting degeneracy of the genetic code, allelic variants, species homologues, etc. Nucleotide analogues can be incorporated into the nucleic acids by methods well known in the art. The only requirement is that the incorporated nucleotide analogues must serve to base pair with target polynucleotide sequences. For example, certain guanine nucleotides can be substituted with hypoxanthine which base pairs with cytosine residues. However, these base pairs are less stable than those between guanine and cytosine. Alternatively, adenine nucleotides can be substituted with 2,6-diaminopurine which can form stronger base pairs than those between adenine and-thymidine. The invention also relates to nucleic acid probes that are at least about 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% identical in sequence to a polynucleotide target of interest, or to a complement thereof. The invention also relates to nucleic acid probes that are at least about 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 98% or 99% identical or complementary to one of the nucleic acids of the invention corresponding to genes 1-54. Conventional algorithms can be used to determine the percent identity or complementarity, e.g., as described by Lipman and Pearson (Proc. Natl Acad Sci 80:726-730, 1983) or Martinez/Needleman-Wunsch (Nucl Acid Research 11:4629-4634, 1983). The invention also relates to nucleic acid probes that hybridize specifically to corresponding target polunucleotides, e.g., under conditions of high stringency. Hybridization condtions are discussed elsewhere herein. Some nucleic acid probes may not hybridize effectively under hybridization conditions due to secondary structure. To optimize probe hybridization, the probe sequences may be examined using a computer algorithm to identify portions of genes without potential secondary structure. Such computer algorithms are well known in the art, such as OLIGO 4.06 Primer Analysis Software (National Biosciences, Plymouth, Minn.) or LASERGENE software (DNASTAR, Madison, Wis); MACDASLS software (Hitachi Software Engineering Co, Std. South San Francisco, Calif.) and the like. These programs can search nucleotide sequences to identify stem loop structures and tandem repeats and to analyze G+C content of the sequence (those sequences with a G+C content greater than 60% are excluded). Alternatively, the probes can be optimized by trial and error. Experiments can be performed to determine whether probes and complementary target polynucleotides hybridize optimally under experimental conditions. With regard to chemical variants, the nucleic acids can include nucleotides that have been derivatized chemically or enzymatically. Typical chemical modifications include derivatization with acyl, alkyl, aryl or amino groups. Suitable modified base moieties include, for example, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-chlorouracil, 5-iodouracil, hypoxanthine, xanthine, 4-acetylcytosine, 5-(carboxyhydroxylmethyl)uracil, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyl-ω-thiouridine, 5-carboxymethyl-aminomethyl uracil, dihydrouracil, β-D-galactosylqueosine, inosine, N6-isopentenyladenine, 1-methylguanine, 3-methyl-cytosine, 5-methylcytosine, N6-adenine, 7-methylguanine, 5-methylaminomethyluracil, 5-methoxyaminomethyl-2-thiouracil, β-D-mannosylqueosine, 5-methoxy-carboxymethyluracil, 5-methoxyuracil-2-methylthio-N6-iso-pentenyladenine, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid, butoxosine, pseudouracil, queuosine, 2-thio-cytosine, 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-methyluracil, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, uracil-t-oxyacetic acid, 5-methyl-2-thiouracil, 3(3-amino-3-N-2-carboxypropyl)uracil and 2,6-diaminopurine. The nucleic acid may comprise at least one modified sugar moiety including, but not limited, to arabinose, 2-fluoroarabinose, xylulose, and hexose. The nucleic acid may comprise a modified phosphate backbone synthesized from one or more nucleotides having, for example, one of the following structures; a phosphorothioate, a phosphoridothioate, a phosphoramidothioate, a phosphoramidate, a phosphordiimidate, a methylphosphonate, an alkyl phosphotriester, 3′-aminopropyl and a form acetal or analog thereof. The nucleic acid may be an α-anomeric oligonucleotide which forms specific double-stranded hybrids with complementary RNA in which, contrary to the usual β-units, the strands run parallel to each other (Gautier et al. (1987), Nucl. Acids Res. 15:6625-6641). The nucleic acid may be conjugated to another molecule, e.g., a peptide, a hybridization-triggered cross-linking agent, a hybridization-triggered cleavage agent, etc., all of which are well-known in the art. With regard to length variants (active fragments), those skilled in the art will appreciate that a probe of choice for a particular gene can be the full length coding sequence or any fragment thereof having generally at least about 8 or at least about 15 nucleotides. When the full length sequence is known, the practitioner can select any appropriate fragment of that sequence, using conventional methods. In some embodiments, multiple probes, corresponding to different portions of a given SEQ ID (molecular marker) of the invention, are used. For example, probes representing about 10 non-overlapping 20-mers can be selected from a 200-mer sequence. Thus, for example, if each of the 54 molecular markers of the invention is represented by 10 probes, the total number of the probes corresponding to the molecular markers in the composition (e.g., in a microarray) will be 540. A skilled worker can design a suitable selection of overlapping or non-overlapping probes corresponding to each expressed polynucleotide of interest, without undue experimentation. A nucleic acid probe of the invention can be of any suitable length. The size of the DNA sequence of interest may vary, and is preferably from about 8 to about 10,000 nucleotides, e.g. from about 50 to about 3,500 nucleotides. In some embodiments, full-length coding sequences are preferred. In others, the nucleic acids range from about 50 to about 200 nucleotides, preferably from about 50 to about 80 nucleotides. All ranges provided herein include the end point values. Any nucleic acid that can uniquely identify a polynucleotide of the invention (e.g., that can hybridize to it specifically) is included in the invention. In general, a nucleic acid comprising at least about 8, 10, 15, 20 or 25 or more contiguous nucleotides contains sufficient information to specify uniquely a gene of a mammalian (e.g., human) genome. Practically, larger oligonucleotides are generally used as probes. Nucleic acid probes (e.g., oligonucleotides) of this invention may be synthesized, in whole or in part, by standard synthetic methods known in the art. See, e.g., Caruthers et al. (1980) Nucleic. Acids Symp. Ser. (2) 215-233; Stein et al. (1998), Nucl. Acids Res. 16, 3209; and Sarin et al, (1988), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 7448-7451. An automated synthesizer (such as those commercially available from Biosearch, Applied Biosystems) may be used. DNA probes can be cloned and isolated by conventional methods; can be isolated from pre-existing clones, such as those from Incyte as described herein; or can be prepared by a combination of conventional synthetic methods. A composition comprising nucleic acids of the invention can take any of a variety of forms. For example, the nucleic acids can be fi-e in a solution (e.g., an aqueous solution), and can, e.g., be subjected to hybridization in solution to polynucleotides from a sample of interest. Methods of hybridization in solution are well-known in the art. Alternatively, the nucleic acids can be in the final of an array. The term “array” as used herein means an ordered arrangement of addressable, accessible, spatially discrete or identifiable, molecules disposed on a surface. The molecules in the array can be hybridizable elements (e.g., nucleic acids) or reactive elements (e.g., antibodies). Arrays can comprise any number of sites that comprise probes, from about 5 to, in the case of a microarray, tens to hundreds of thousands or more. Any of a variety of suitable, compatible surfaces can be used in conjunction with this invention. The surface (usually a solid, preferably a suitable rigid or semi-rigid support) can be any of a variety of organic or inorganic materials or combinations thereof, including, merely by way of example, plastics such as polypropylene or polystyrene; ceramic; silicon; (fused) silica, quartz or glass, which can have the thickness of, for example, a glass microscope slide or a glass cover slip; paper, such as filter paper; diazotized cellulose; nitrocellulose filters; nylon membrane; or polyacrylamide gel pad. Substrates that are transparent to light are useful when the method of performing an assay involves optical detection. Suitable surfaces include membranes, filters, chips, slides, wafers, fibers, magnetic or nomnagnetic beads, gels, tubing, plates, polymers, microparticles, capillaries, or the like. The substrate can have a variety of surface forms, such as wells, trenches, pins, channels and pores, to which the nucleic acid probes are bound. The shape of the surface is not critical. It can, for example, be a flat surface such as a square, rectangle, or circle; a curved surface; or a three dimensional surface such as a bead, particle, strand, precipitate, tube, sphere, etc. Microfluidic devises are also encompassed by the invention. In a preferred embodiment, a composition of nucleic acids is in the form of a microarray (sometimes referred to as a DNA “chip”). Microarrays allow for massively parallel gene expression analysis. See, e.g., Lockhart et at (2002), Nature 405, 827-836 and Phimister (1999), Nature Genetics 21(supp), 1-60. In a microarray, the array elements are arranged so that there are preferably at least one or more different array elements, more preferably at least about 100 array elements, and most preferably at least about 1,000 array elements, on a 1 cm2 substrate surface. The maximum number of array elements is unlimited, and can be at least 100,000 array elements. Furthermore, the hybridization signal ham each of the array elements is individually distinguishable. Methods of making DNA arrays, including microarrays are conventional. For example, the probes may be synthesized directly on the surface; or preformed molecules, such as oligonucleotides or cDNAs, may be introduced onto (e.g., bound to, or otherwise immobilized on) the surface. Among suitable fabrication methods are photolithography, pipetting, drop-touch, piezoelectric printing (ink-jet), or the like. For some typical methods, see Ekins et al. (1999), Trends in Biotech 17, 217-218; Healey et al. (1995) Science 269, 1078-80; WO95/251116; WO95/35505; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,605,662. Furthermore, the probes do not have to be directly bound to the substrate, but rather can be bound to the substrate through a linker group. The linker groups are typically about 6 to 50 atoms long to provide exposure to the attached nucleic acid probe. Preferred linker groups include ethylene glycol oligomers, diamines, diacids and the like. Reactive groups on the substrate surface react with one of the terminal portions of the linker to bind the linker to the substrate. The other terminal portion of the linker is then functionalized for binding the nucleic acid probe. A composition of the invention may comprise, optionally, nucleic acids (or polypeptides, or antibodies) that act as internal controls. The controls may he positive controls or negative controls, examples of which will be evident to the skilled worker. in order to conduct an analysis of expressed genes, a sample representing expressed target genes (polynucleolides or polypeptides) is first derived from a rectal adenocarcinoma. As used herein, “polynucleotides” refers to a target whose expression is analyzed, whereas “nucleic acid” refers to a composition (of probes) used to analyze the expression of the polynucleotides. The sample can be derived from any bodily fluid (blood, urine, saliva, phlegm, gastric juices, etc.), from stool samples, or from cultured cells. Preferably, the sample is derived from rectal biopsy tissue. Because rectal adenocarcinoma cells can also he present in peripheral blood, blood samples may also be used. DNA or RNA can be isolated according to any of a number of methods well known to those of skill in the art. For example, methods of purification of nucleic acids are described in Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology: Hybridization With Nucleic Acid Probes, Part I. Theory and Nucleic Acid Preparation, P. Tijssen, ed. Elsevier, New York, N.Y. (1993). In one case, total RNA is isolated using the TRIZOL total RNA isolation reagent (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, Md.) and mRNA is isolated using oligo d(T) column chromatography or glass beads. Alternatively, when target polynucleotides are derived from an mRNA, the target polynucleotide can he a eDNA reverse transcribed from an mRNA, an RNA transcribed from that cDNA, a DNA amplified from that eDNA, an RNA transcribed from the amplified DNA, or the like. When the target polynucleotide is derived from DNA, the target polynucleotide can be DNA amplified from DNA or RNA reverse transcribed from DNA. In yet another alternative, the targets are target polynucleotides prepared by more than one method. Accordingly, a polynucleotide sample “representing expressed genes” can comprise, e.g., mRNA, cRNA, cDNA, PCR products, or the like. When target polynucleotides are amplified it is desirable to amplify the polynucleotide and maintain the relative abundances of the original sample, including low abundance transcripts. Total mRNA can be converted to cDNA and amplified by conventional procedures. For example, in one embodiment, mRNA is amplified by reverse transcription using a reverse transcriptase and a primer consisting of oligo d(T) and a sequence encoding the phage T7 promoter to provide a single stranded DNA template. The second cDNA strand is polymerized using a DNA polymerase and a RNAse which assists in breaking up the DNA/RNA hybrid. After synthesis of the double stranded cDNA, T7 RNA polymerase can be added and RNA transcribed from the second eDNA strand template (Van Gelder et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,545,522). RNA can be amplified in vitro, in situ or in viva (See Eberwine, U.S. Pat. No. 5,514,545). A cDNA may be amplified by any of a variety of conventional amplification procedures, including PCR. Suitable PCR primers can be selected using routine, any-recognized methods. For guidance with regard to designing suitable primers and other facets of PCR methodology, see hints et al. eds. PCR Protocols: a guide to methods and applications, 1990, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. or other standard references or manuals. It is advantageous to include quantitation controls within the sample to assure that amplification and labeling procedures do not change the true distribution of target polynucleotides in a sample. For this purpose, a sample can be spiked with a known amount of a control target polynucleotide and the composition of nucleic acid probes can include reference nucleic acid probes which specifically hybridize with the control target polynucleotides. After hybridization and processing, the hybridization signals obtained should reflect accurately the amounts of control target polynucleotide added to the sample. Prior to hybridization, it may be desirable to :fragment the target polynucleotides. Fragmentation improves hybridization by minimizing secondary structure and cross-hybridization to other nucleic acid target polynucleotides in the sample or noncomplementary nucleic acid probes. Fragmentation can be performed by mechanical, enzymatic or chemical means. The target polynucleotides may be labeled with one or more labeling moieties to allow for detection of hybridized probe/target polynucleotide complexes. The labeling moieties can include compositions that can be detected by spectroscopic, photochemical, biochemical, bioelectronic, immunochemical, electrical, optical or chemical means. The labeling moieties include radioisotopes, such as 32P, 33P or 35S, chemiluminescent compounds, labeled binding proteins, heavy metal atoms, spectroscopic markers, such as fluorescent markers and dyes, magnetic labels, linked enzymes, mass spectrometry tags, spin labels, electron transfer donors and acceptors, and the like. In a preferred embodiment, a fluorescent dye is incorporated directly by using a fluorochrome conjugated nucleotide triphosphate (e.g. Cy3-dUTP) or through a secondary coupling reaction by first incorporating an amino allyl conjugated nucleotide triphosphate (e.g. amino allyl-dUTP) followed by chemical coupling of the fluorochrome (e.g. NHS-Cy3). Exemplary dyes include quinoline dyes, triarylmethane dyes, phthaleins, azo dyes, cyanine dyes and the like. Preferably, fluorescent markers absorb light above about 300 nm, preferably above 400 nm, and usually emit light at wavelengths at least greater than 10 nm above the wavelength of the light absorbed. Specific preferred fluorescent markers include fluorescein, phycoerythrin, rhodamine, lissamine, and Cy3 and Cy5 available from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Piscataway, N.J.). Labeling can be carried out during an amplification reaction, such as polymerase chain and in vitro transcription reactions, or by nick translation or 5′ or 3′-end-labeling reactions. In one case, labeled nucleotides are used in an in vitro transcription reaction. When the label is incorporated after or without an amplification step, the label is incorporated by using terminal transferase or by kinasing the 5′ end of the target polynucleotide and then incubating overnight with a labeled oligonucleotide in the presence of T4 RNA ligase. Alternatively, the labeling moiety can be incorporated after hybridization once a probe/target complex has formed. In one case, biotin is first incorporated during an amplification step as described above. After the hybridization reaction, unbound polynucleotides are rinsed away so that the only biotin remaining bound to the substrate is that attached to target polynucleotides that are hybridized to the nucleic acid probes. Then, an avidin-conjugated fluorophore, such as avidin-phycoerythrin, that binds with high affinity to biotin is added. In another case, the labeling moiety is incorporated by intercalation into preformed target/polynucleotide probe complexes. In this case, an intercalating dye such as a psoralen-linked dye can be employed. Under some circumstances it may be advantageous to immobilize the target polynucleotides on a substrate and have the nucleic acid probes bind to the immobilized target polynucleotides. In such cases the target polynucleotides can be attached to a substrate as described above. Hybridization causes a denatured nucleic acid probe and a denatured complementary target polynucleotide to form a stable duplex through base pairing. Hybridization methods are well known to those skilled in the art (See, for example, Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Vol. 24: Hybridization With Nucleic Acid Probes, P. Tijssen, ed. Elsevier, New York, N.Y. (1993)). Conditions can be selected for hybridization where exactly complementary target and nucleic acid probe can hybridize, i.e., each base pair must interact with its complementary base pair. Alternatively, conditions can be selected where target and probes have mismatches but are still able to hybridize. Suitable conditions can be selected, for example, by varying the concentrations of salt or formamide in the prehybridization, hybridization and wash solutions, or by varying the hybridization and wash temperatures. Hybridization can be performed at low stringency with buffers, such as 6× SSPE with 0.005% Triton X-100 at 37° C., which permits hybridization between target and polynucleotide probes that contain some mismatches to form target polynucleotide/probe complexes. Subsequent washes are performed at higher stringency with buffers, such as 0.5×SSPE with 0.005% Triton X-100 at 50° C., to retain hybridization of only those target/probe complexes that contain exactly complementary sequences. Alternatively, hybridization can be performed with buffers, such as 5×SSC/0.2% SDS at 60° C., and washes performed in 2×SSC/0.2% SDS and then in 0.1×SSC. Stringency can also be increased by adding agents such as formamide. Background signals can be reduced by the use of detergent, such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, Sarcosyl or Triton X-100, or a blocking agent, such as sperm DNA or bovine serum albumin (BSA). In a preferred embodiment, nucleic acid probes of the invention hybridize specifically to target polynucleotides of interest under conditions of high stringency. As used herein, “conditions of high stringency” or “high stringent hybridization conditions” means any conditions in which hybridization will occur when there is at least about 95%, preferably about 97 to 100%, nucleotide complementarity (identity) between the nucleic acids (e.g., a polynucleotide of interest and a nucleic acid probe). Generally, high stringency conditions are selected to be about 5° C. to 20° C. lower than the thermal melting point (Tm) for the specific sequence at a defined ionic strength and pH. Appropriate high stringent hybridization conditions include, e.g., hybridization in a buffer such as, for example, 6× SSPE-T (0.9 M NaCl, 60 mM NaH, PO4, 6 mM EDTA and 0.05% Triton X-100) for between about 10 minutes and about at least 3 hours (in a preferred embodiment, at least about 15 minutes) at a temperature ranging from about 4° C. to about 37° C.). In a most preferred embodiment, hybridization under high stringent conditions is carried out in 5×SSC, 50% (lionized Formarnide, 0.1% SDS at 42° C. overnight. Hybridization specificity can be evaluated by comparing the hybridization of specificity-control nucleic acid probes to specificity-control target polynucleotides that are added to a sample in a known amount. The specificity-control target polynucleotides may have one or more sequence mismatches compared with the corresponding nucleic acid probes. In this manner, whether only complementary target polynucleotides are hybridizing to the nucleic acid probes or whether mismatched hybrid duplexes are forming is determined. Hybridization reactions can be performed in absolute or differential hybridization formats. In the absolute hybridization format, target polynucleotides from one sample are hybridized to the probes in an array (e.g., in a microarray format) and signals detected after hybridization complex formation correlate to target polynucleotide levels in a sample. In the differential hybridization format, the differential expression of a set of genes in two biological samples is analyzed. For differential hybridization, target polynucleotides from both biological samples are prepared and labeled with different labeling moieties. A mixture of the two labeled target polynucleotides is added to an array (e.g., a microarray). The array is then examined under conditions in which the emissions from the two different labels are individually detectable. Probes in the array that are hybridized to substantially equal numbers of target polynucleotides derived from both biological samples give a distinct combined fluorescence (Shalon et al. PCT publication WO95/35505). In a preferred embodiment, the labels are fluorescent labels with distinguishable emission spectra, such as a lissamine conjugated nucleotide analog and a fluorescein conjugated nucleotide-analog. In another embodiment Cy3/Cy5 fluorophores (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) are employed. After hybridization, the array (e.g., microarray) is washed to remove nonhybridized polynucleotides and complex formation between the hybridizable array elements and the target polynucleotides is detected. Methods for detecting complex formation are well known to those skilled in the art. In a preferred embodiment, the target polynucleotides are labeled with a fluorescent label and levels and patterns of fluorescence indicative of complex formation are measured. In one embodiment, the measurement is accomplished by fluorescence microscopy, preferably confocal fluorescence microscopy. An argon ion laser excites the fluorescent label, emissions are directed to a photomultiplier and the amount of emitted light detected and quantitated. The detected signal should be proportional to the amount of probe/target polynucleotide complex at each position of the microarray. The fluorescence microscope can be associated with a computer-driven scanner device to generate a quantitative two-dimensional image of hybridization intensity. The scanned image is examined to determine the abundance/expression level of each hybridized target polynucleotide. In another embodiment, the measurement of levels and patterns of fluorescence is accomplished with a fluorescent imaging device, such as a microarray scanner (e.g., Axon scanner with GenePix Pro software). As with the previous measurement method, the measurements can be used to determine the abundance/expression level of each hybridized target polynucleotide. In a differential hybridization experiment, target polynucleotides from two or more different biological samples are labeled with two or more different fluorescent labels with different emission wavelengths. Fluorescent signals are detected separately with different photomultipliers set to detect specific wavelengths. The relative abundances/expression levels of the target polynucleotides in two or more samples is obtained. Typically, array fluorescence intensities can be normalized to take into account variations in hybridization intensities when more than one array is used under similar test conditions. In a preferred embodiment, individual probe/target complex hybridization intensities are normalized using the intensities derived from internal normalization controls contained on each microarray. Other methods for quantitating the amount of an expressed nucleic acid (e.g., an expressed mRNA) corresponding to a molecular marker of interest of the invention will be evident to the skilled worker. For example, any of a variety of quantitative amplification procedures, such as quantitative PCR, can be carried out. Methods for selecting suitable amplification primers, based on the sequences disclosed herein, for optimizing amplification conditions, and for detecting and quantitating the amplified product, are conventional. Some such procedures are discussed herein with reference to amplifying nucleic acid samples in preparation for hybridization assays. Other aspects of the invention relate to methods for determining the responsiveness of a rectal adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy, comprising detecting the presence of and/or quantitating the amount of, one or more protein (polypeptide) products whose expression is correlated with the responsiveness. The terms “protein” and “polypeptide” are used interchangeably herein. Polypeptides whose expression is measured include those comprising SEQ ID NOs: 59-112. The presence or quantity of the protein product in a body fluid, a stool sample, or, preferably, in a tissue or cell sample from the subject, is determined, and compared to a baseline value. Methods of preparing samples (e.g., from patients) for polypeptide analysis are conventional and well known in the art, and a variety of methods known to skilled workers can be used to determine the amount of these proteins. For example, enzymatic activities of the proteins can be measured, using conventional procedures. Alternatively, the proteins can be detected by immunological methods such as, e.g., immunoassays (EIA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), immunofluorescence microscopy, or immunahistochemistry, all of which assay methods are fully conventional. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,602,661. The invention includes antibodies which are specific for polypeptides comprising SEQ ID NOs: 59-112, or for active variants or fragments of these polypeptides. An “active” variant or fragment of a polypeptide of the invention is one which is able to bind to, or to elicit, an antibody that is specific for a polypeptide corresponding to one of genes 1-54. For example, polypeptides comprising small substitutions, additions, deletions, etc., are tolerated provided they retain the ability to elicit a desired antibody, as are suitable antigenic fragments of the polypeptides. Antigens that exhibit at least about 90% (e.g., at least about 95%, or at least about 98%)sequence identity to a polypeptide comprising one of SEQ ID NOs; 59-112, or to a fragment thereof, are also tolerated. Methods for determining ifs polypeptide exhibits a particular percent identity to a polypeptide comprising, e.g., one of SEQ ID NOs; 59-112 are conventional; algorithms such as those discussed elsewhere herein in regard to nucleic acids can be used. In a preferred embodiment, antibodies of the invention are immobilized on a surface (e.g., are reactive elements on an array, such as a microarray, or are on another surface, such as used for surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based technology [e.g., Biacore]), and polypeptides in the sample are detected by virtue of their ability to bind specifically to the antibodies. Methods of preparing the surfaces and performing the analyses are conventional. Any of a variety of antibodies can be used in methods of the invention. Such antibodies include, e.g., polyclonal, monoclonal (mAbs), recombinant, humanized or partially humanized, single chain, Fab, and fragments thereof. The antibodies can be of any isotype, e.g., IgM, various IgG isotypes such as IgG1′ IgG2a etc., and they can be from any animal species that produces antibodies, including goat, rabbit, mouse, chicken or the like. An antibody “specific for” a polypeptide means that the antibody recognizes a defined sequence of amino acids, or epitope, either present in the full length polypeptide or in a peptide fragment thereof. Antibodies can be prepared according to conventional method, which are well known, e.g. Green at al., Production of Polyclonal Antisera, in Immunochemical Protocols (Manson, ed.), (Humana Press 1992); Coligan at al., in Current Protocols in Immunology, Sec. 2.4.1 (1992); Kohler & Milstein (1975), Nature 256 495; Coligan at al., sections 2.5.1-2.6.7; and Harlow at al., Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, page 726 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Pub. 1988), Methods of preparing humanized or partially humanized antibodies, and antibody fragments, and methods of purifying antibodies, are conventional. The molecular profiling information described herein can be harnessed for the purpose of identifying agents (e.g., drugs) that can enhance (increase, facilitate, potentiate, etc.) the response of a rectal adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy. Such agents are particularly useful when administered, as therapeutic agents, in conjunction with radiochemotherapy, in order to enhance the effect of the radiochemotherapy. For example, the agents can be administered to a subject before, during or after radiochemotherapy is carried out. Agents are selected which enhance expression or activity of one or more genes whose up-regulation is correlated with the responsiveness, and/or which decrease expression and/or activity of one or more genes whose down-regulation is correlated with the responsiveness. In assays to identify such agents, putative agents are introduced into cells, and either polynucleotide expression or activity levels, or polypeptide expression or activity levels, are measured. The expression and/or activity levels of polynucleotides or polypeptides corresponding to marker genes of the invention are determined. Preferably, the methods are carried out in vitro, with cultured cells or with tumor tissue, and employ high throughput procedures. Candidate agents selected in this manner can then be tested further in vivo. In one embodiment, rectal adenocarcinoma cell lines are prepared from tumors that are either responsive or non-responsive to radiochemotherapy, using standard methods, and are profiled using the present methods. Preferred cell lines are those that maintain the expression profile of the primary tumor from which they were derived. One or several such cell lines may be used as a “general” panel; alternatively or additionally, cell lines from individual subjects may be prepared and used. In other embodiments, previously established rectal adenocarcinoma cell lines are used or non-tumor rectal cells, or cells from other normal tissues, are used. A skilled worker can readily select a suitable cell line to use in the method. The molecular alterations in cell line cells contacted with a putative modulatory agent can be measured at the mRNA level (gene expression) applying conventional methods, such as those disclosed herein. Alternatively, one can assay the protein product(s) or activities of the selected gene(s), using conventional procedures. For example, in the ease of secreted or cell-surface proteins, expression can be assessed using immunoassay or other immunological methods including enzyme immunoassays (EIA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), immunofluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry. EIAs are described in greater detail in several references (Butler, J E, In: Structure of Antigens, Vol. 1 (Van Regenmortel, M., CRC Press, Boca Raton 1992, pp. 209-259; Butler, J E, “ELISA,” In: van Oss, C. J. et al. (eds), Immunochemistry, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York, 1994, pp. 759-803; Butler, J E (ed,), Immunochemistry of Solid-Phase Immunoassay, CRC Press, Boca Raton, 1991). RIAs are discussed in Kirkham and Hunter (eds.), Radioimmune Assay Methods, E. & S. Livingstone, Edinburgh, 1970. Preferably, polypeptide samples are contacted with antibody compositions of the invention that are in the form of an array, such as a microarray, and are analyzed as described elsewhere herein. Without wishing to be bound by any particular mechanism, it is suggested that, among the types of agents that can be tested and identified as therapeutic agents are, e.g., agents that (1) act on a cellular pathway that inhibits or stimulates expression of a gene of interest, (2) act directly on the protein product, or (3) bypass the step in a cellular pathway mediated by the product of this gene. A variety of types of agents can be tested and identified as the desired agents. For example, one can utilize known properties of a target protein to devise agents to stimulate or inhibit its production or activity, as desired. That is, one can devise a means to inhibit the action of or bind, block, remove or otherwise diminish the presence, activity and/or availability of, a protein whose down-regulation is associated with responsiveness to radiochemotherapy; or one can devise a means to stimulate the action of, or to potentiate or enhance the activity of or availability of; a protein whose up-regulation is associated with such responsiveness. For example, in the case of a cellular receptor, one could expose the receptor to an antagonist, a soluble form of the receptor or a “decoy” ligand binding site of a receptor (to compete for ligand) (Gershoni J M et al., (1988) Proc Natl Aced Sci USA 85, 4087-9; U.S. Pat. No. 5,770,572) to inhibit it. Antibodies may be administered to a cell to bind and inactivate (or compete with), or to enhance the activity of, secreted protein products or expressed cell-surface products of genes of interest. Another approach is to employ antisense oligonucleotides or nucleic acid constructs that inhibit expression of a gene whose down-regulation is desired, in a highly specific manner. Methods to select, test and optimize putative antisense sequences are routine. In one embodiment, nucleic acid constructs are used to express an antisense molecule of interest. Methods to operatively link appropriate antisense sequences to an appropriate regulatory element, e.g., a promoter, such as a strong promoter, an inducible strong promoter, or the like. Inducible promoters include, e.g., an estrogen inducible system (Braselmann et al. (1993) Proc Natl Acid Sci USA 90, 1657-1661). Also known are repressible systems driven by the conventional antibiotic, tetracycline (Gossen et al,, (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 5547-5551). In another embodiment of inhibition by antisense, antisense oligonucleotides are administered to a cell. The oligonucleotides can be DNA or RNA or chimeric mixtures or derivatives or modified versions thereof, single-stranded or double-stranded. The oligonucleotides can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety, or phosphate backbone (as discussed above). The oligonucleotide may include other appending groups such as peptides, or agents facilitating transport across the cell membrane (see, e.g. Letsinger at al. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 684-652; PCT Publication WO 88/09810 (1988)), hybridization-triggered cleavage agents (e.g. Krol et al, (1988), Bio Techniques 6, 958-976) or intercalating agents (e.g., Zon (1988), Pharm. Res 5, 539-549), Multiple antisense constructs or oligonucleotides specific for different genes can be employed together. The sequences of the downregulated genes described herein can be used to design the antisense molecules (Hambor et al., (1988) J. Exp. Med. 168, 1237-1245; Holt et al., (1986) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. 83, 4794-4798; Izant et al., (1984) Cell 36, 1007-1015); Izant et al,, (1985) Science 222, 345-352; De Benedetti et al., (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 84, 658-662). The antisense sequences may range from about 6 to about 50 nucleotides, and may be as large as 100 or 200 nucleotides, or larger. They may correspond to full-length coding sequences and/or may be genomic sequences that comprise non-coding sequences. Another approach is to use ribozymes that can specifically cleave nucleic acids encoding the overexpressed genes of the invention. Such methods are routine in the art and methods of making and using any of a variety of appropriate ribozymes are well known to the skilled worker. For reviews on ribozymes see e.g., Ohkawa et al. (1995) J. Biochem. 118, 251-258; Sigurdsson et al. (1995) Trends Biotechnol. 13, 286-289; Rossi, J. J. (1995) Trends Biotechnol. 13, 301-306; Kiehntopf et al. (1995) J. Mol. Med. 73, 65-71). A ribozyme having specificity for an mRNA of interest can be designed based upon the nucleotide sequence of, e.g., the corresponding cDNA. For example, a derivative of a Tetrahymena L-19 IVS RNA can be constructed in which the base sequence of the active site is complementary to the base sequence to be cleaved in an mRNA corresponding to one of the overexpressed genes of the invention. See for example U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,987,071 and 5,116,742, both by Cech et al. Alternatively, the sequence of an overexpressed gene of the invention can be used to select a catalytic RNA having a specific ribonuclease activity from a pool of RNA molecules. See for example Bartel et al. (1993) Science 261, 1411-1418. Another approach involves double stranded RNAs called small interfering RNAs. An siRNA is a double-stranded RNA molecule comprising self-complementary sense and antisense regions, wherein the antisense region comprises nucleotide sequence that is complementary to nucleotide sequence in a target nucleic acid molecule or a portion thereof, and the sense region has a nucleotide sequence corresponding to the target nucleic acid sequence or a portion thereof. The siRNA can be assembled from two separate oligonucleotides, where one strand is the sense strand and the other is the antisense strand, wherein the antisense and sense strands are self-complementary. The siRNA can be assembled from a single oligonucleotide, where the self-complementary sense and antisense regions of the siRNA are linked by means of a nucleic acid based or non-nucleic acid-based linker(s). The siRNA can be a polynucleotide with a hairpin secondary structure, having self-complementary sense and antisense regions. The siRNA can be a circular single-stranded polynucleotide having two or more loop structures and a stem comprising self-complementary sense and antisense regions, wherein the circular polynucleotide can be processed either in vivo or in vitro to generate an active siNA molecule capable of mediating RNAi. In certain embodiments, the siNA molecule of the invention comprises separate sense and antisense sequences or regions, wherein the sense and antisense regions are covalently linked by nucleotide or non-nucleotide linkers molecules as is known in the art, or are alternately non-covalently linked by ionic interactions, hydrogen bonding, van der waals interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and/or stacking interactions. RNAi molecules can be used to inhibit gene expression, using conventional procedures. Typical method to design, make and use interfering RNA molecules are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat.

For methods to use siRNAs to inhibit expression, see e,g. Hannon (2002) Nature 418, 244-251; Bernstein et al., (2002) RNA 7, 1509-1521; Hutvagner et al., Curr. Opin. Genetics & Development 12, 225-232; Brummelkamp (2002) Science 296, 550-553; Lee et al. (2002) Nature Biotechnol 20, 500-505; Miyagishi et al. (2002) Nature Biotechnol. 20, 497-500; Paddison at al.

USA 99, 6047-6052. Another approach is to use small molecules (sometimes referred to herein as “compounds”). They may be isolated from natural sources or developed synthetically, e.g., by combinatorial chemistry. In general, such molecules are identified from large libraries of natural products or synthetic (or semi-synthetic) extracts or chemical libraries according to methods known in the art. Those skilled in the field of drug discovery and development will understand that the precise source of test extracts or compounds is not critical to the methods of the invention. Accordingly, virtually any number of chemical extracts or compounds can be used in the methods described herein. Examples of such extracts or compounds include, but are not limited to, plant-, fungal-, prokaryotic- or animal-based extracts, fermentation broths, and synthetic compounds, as well as modification of existing compounds. Numerous methods are also available for generating random or directed synthesis (e.g., semi-synthesis or total synthesis) of any number of chemical compounds, including, but not limited to, saccharide-, lipid-, peptide-, polypeptide- and nucleic acid-based compounds. Synthetic compound libraries are commercially available, e.g., from Brandon Associates (Merrimack, N.H.) and Aldrich Chemical (Milwaukee, Wis.). Alternatively, libraries of natural compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant, and animal extracts are commercially available from a number of sources, e.g., Biotics (Sussex, UK), Xenova (Slough, UK), Harbor Branch Oceangraphics Institute (Ft. Pierce, Fla.), and PharmaMar, U.S.A. (Cambridge, Mass.), In addition, natural and synthetically produced libraries are generated, if desired, according to methods known in the art, e.g., by standard extraction and fractionation methods. Furthermore, if desired, any library or compound is readily modified using standard chemical, physical, or biochemical methods. Once a molecule has been identified in vitro as a candidate agent that increases the responsiveness of a rectal adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy, one can further determine in vivo if the candidate does, in fact, increase the responsiveness in a subject. Furthermore, if a candidate agent is shown to inhibit or stimulate expression or activity o f several genes whose expression is correlated with the responsiveness, one can inhibit or stimulate the expression of each of the genes individually, in viva, in order ID determine those genes whose expression is correlated to the responsiveness. The candidate agent(s) can be introduced into any suitable animal model for rectal carcinoma. Eventually, agents that have been shown to be safe and effective in animal models can be tested and used in human patients. Methods for introducing agents into cells or animals are conventional. For example, methods of gene transfer can be used, wherein antisense molecules, ribozymes, or siRNAs are introduced into a rectal adenocarcinoma cell, tissue or organ of interest, or nucleic acids that encode proteins which modulate (up-regulate or down-regulate) the production or activity of one or more of the genes of the invention are so introduced. Methods of gene transfer are conventional, and include virus-mediated gene transfer, for example, with retroviruses (Nabel et al. (1989) Science 244, 1342), lentiviruses, and recombinant adenovirus vectors (Horowitz, M. S., In Virology, Fields, B N et al, eds, Raven Press, New York, 1990, p. 1679, or current edition; Berkner (1988) Biotechniques 6, 616-29, Strauss, S E, In; The Adenoviruses, Ginsberg, H S, ed., Plenum Press, New York, 1984, or current edition). Adeno-associated virus (AAV) can also be used (Samulski et al, (1991)EMBO J. 10, 3941 (1991); Lebkowski et al. (1988) Mol. Cell. Biol. 8, 3988-3996; Kahn et al (1990), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 2211-2215; Hermonat et al, (1984), J. Viral. 51, 329-339). Improved efficiency is attained by the use of promoter enhancer elements in the DNA constructs (Philip et al. (1993), J. Biol. Chem. 268, 16087-16090). In addition to virus-mediated gene transfer, physical means well-known in the art can be used for direct gene transfer, including administration of plasmid DNA (Wolff at al, 1990, supra) and particle-bombardment mediated gene transfer, originally described in the transformation of plant tissue (Klein et al (1987), Nature 327, 70 (1987); Christou, at al. (1990), Trends Biotechnol. 6, 145) but also applicable to mammalian tissues in vivo, ex vivo or in vitro (Yang et al, (1990), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87, 9568 (1990); Williams at al. (1991), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 2726; Zelenin et al. (1991), FEBS Lett. 280, 94; Zelenin at al. (1989), FEBS Lett. 244, 65; Johnston et al. (1991), In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol, 27, 11). Furthermore, electroporation or calcium phosphate transfection, both well-known means to transfer genes into cell in vitro, can also be used to transfer DNA molecules according to the present invention to tissues in vivo (Pear et al. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 8392; Titomirov at al. (1991), Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1088, 131). Gene transfer can also be achieved using “carrier mediated gene transfer” (Wu et al. (1989), J. Biol. Chem. 264, 16985; Wu at al. (1988), J. Biol., Chem. 263, 14621; Soriano et al. (1983), Proc. Nail. Acad. Set. USA 80, 7128; Wang at al. (1982), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 7851; Wilson at al. (1992), J. Biol. Chem. 267, 963). Preferred carriers are targeted liposomes (Nicolau at al. (1983), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA 80, 1068 (1983); Soriano at al., supra) such as immunoliposomes, which can incorporate acylated monoclonal antibodies into the lipid bilayer (Wang at al., supra), or polycations such as asialoglycoprotein/polylysine (Wu et al., 1989, supra). Liposomes have been used to encapsulate and deliver a variety of materials to cells, including nucleic acids and viral particles (Faller et al (1984), J. Virol. 49, 269-272). Preformed liposomes that contain synthetic cationic: lipids form stable complexes with polyanionic DNA (Feigner at al, (1987), Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. USA 84, 7413-7417). Cationic liposomes, liposomes comprising some cationic lipid, that contained a membrane fusion-promoting lipid dioctadecyldimethyl-ammonium-bromide (DDAB) have efficiently transferred heterologous genes into eukaryotic cells (Rose et al. (1991), Biotechniques 10, 520-525). Cationic liposomes can mediate high level cellular expression of transgenes, or mRNA, by delivering them into a variety of cultured cell lines (Malone et al. (1989), Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 6077-6081). Another embodiment of the invention is a method for identifying a gene whose inhibition (e.g., inhibition of nucleic acid expression or activity, or inhibition of polypeptide synthesis or activity) enhances the response of a rectal tumor to radiochemotherapy. For example, one can test one or more of the genes of the invention whose over-expression is correlated with responsiveness of a rectal adenocarcinoma to radiochemotherapy (e.g., genes 1-41). The method can be carried out in vitro, but is preferably carried out in vivo, in a suitable animal model. In one embodiment, the method comprises: a. inhibiting (completely or partially, using, agents such as those discussed elsewhere herein) in a rectal adenocarcinoma the expression and/or activity of a polynucleotide corresponding to one of genes 1-41 (e.g., polynucleotide that hybridizes specifically to a nucleic acid comprising one of SEQ ID NOs: 1-41 or 113-119, and/or to a fragment that comprises at least about 15 contiguous nucleotides of one of those sequences; or to a complement of one of those fragments); or inhibiting the synthesis and/or activity of a polypeptide corresponding to one of genes 1-41 (e.g., a polypeptide that binds specifically to an antibody of the invention, such as an antibody specific for one of polypeptides comprising SEQ ID NOs: 59-101, and/or for an antigenic fragment of one of those polypeptides), and b. determining if the rectal adenocarcinoma exhibits an increased response to radiochemotherapy, compared to the response in the absence of the inhibition. Another embodiment of the invention is a method for identifying a gene whose stimulation (e.g., stimulation of nucleic acid expression or activity, or stimulation of polypeptide synthesis or activity) enhances the response of a rectal tumor to radiochemotherapy, comprising: a. stimulating (completely or partially, using agents such as those discussed elsewhere herein) in a rectal adenocarcinoma the expression and/or activity of a polynucleotide corresponding to one of genes 42-54 (e.g., a polynucleotide that hybridizes specifically to a nucleic acid comprising one of SEQ NOs: 46-58 or 120-123, and/or to a fragment that comprises at least about 15 contiguous nucleotides of one of those sequences, or to a complement of one of those nucleic acids or fragments); or inhibiting the synthesis and/or activity of a polypeptide corresponding to one of genes 42-54 (e.g., a polypeptide that binds specifically to an antibody of the invention, such as an antibody specific for a polypeptide comprising one of SEQ ID NOs: 102-112, and/or for an antigenic fragment of one of those polypeptides), and b. determining if the rectal adenocarcinoma exhibits an increased response to radiochemotherapy, compared to the response in the absence of the stimulation. Other aspects of the invention are kits suitable for performing any of the methods of the invention. One embodiment of the invention is a kit for detecting the presence and/or amount of a polynucleotide in a sample from a rectal adenocarcinoma, which may indicate that the rectal adenocarcinoma is responsive to radiochemotherapy, comprising a composition of nucleic acids of the invention (e.g., in the form of an array) and, optionally, one or more reagents that facilitate hybridization of the nucleic acids in the composition to a test polynucleotide of interest, and/or that facilitate detection of the hybridized polynucleotide(s), e.,g., that facilitate detection of fluorescence. The kit may comprise a composition of nucleic acids of the invention (e.g., in the form of an array), means for carrying out hybridization of the nucleic acids in the array to a test polynucleotide(s) of interest, and means for reading hybridization results. Hybridization results may be units of fluorescence. Another embodiment is a kit for detecting the presence and/or amount of a polypeptide in a sample from a rectal adenocarcinoma, which may indicate that the rectal adenocarcinoma is responsive to radiochemotherapy, comprising a composition of antibodies of the invention (e.g., in the form of an array) and, optionally, one or more reagents that facilitate binding of the antibodies in the composition with a test protein(s) of interest, or that facilitate detection of bound antibody. The kit may comprise a composition of antibodies of the invention (e.g., in the form of an array or a Biacore chip), means for carrying out binding of the antibodies in the array to a test polypeptide(s) of interest, and means for reading the binding results. Kits of the invention may comprise instructions for performing a method, such as a diagnostic method. Other optional elements of a kit of the invention include suitable buffers, media components, or the like; a computer or computer-readable medium for storing and/or evaluating the assay results; containers; or packaging materials. Reagents for performing suitable controls may also be included. The reagents of the kit may be in containers in which the reagents are stable, e.g., in lyophilized form or stabilized liquids. The reagents may also be in single use form, e.g., in single reaction form for diagnostic use. The present invention also relates to combinations of the invention in which the nucleic acid or protein sequences of the invention are represented, not by physical molecules, but by computer-implemented databases. For example, the present invention relates to electronic forms of polynucleotides, polypeptides, antibodies, etc., of the present invention, including a computer-readable medium (e.g., magnetic, optical, etc., stored in any suitable format, such as flat files or hierarchical files) which comprise such sequences, or fragments thereof, e-commerce-related means, etc. An investigator may, e.g., compare an expression profile exhibited by a rectal adenocarcinoma sample of interest to an electronic form of one of the expression profiles of the invention, and may thereby determine its responsiveness to radiochemotherapy. Having now generally described the invention, the same will be more readily understood through reference to the following examples which are provided by way of illustration, and are not intended to be limiting of the present invention, unless specified. In the foregoing and in the following examples, all temperatures are set forth uncorrected in degrees Celsius; and, unless otherwise indicated, all parts and percentages are by weight. EXAMPLES Example I Patients and Methods A. Selection of Patients and Response Classification All patients are participants in a multicenter, randomized prospective phase III clinical trial (CAO/ARD/AIO-94, German Rectal Cancer Trial) aimed at determining the relative benefits of preoperative (neoadjuvant) versus postoperative (adjuvant) radiochemotherapy (Sauer at al. (2001) Strahleuther Onkol 177, 173-81). For the study here, we collected biopsies from 23 patients between December 2001 to October 2002 who were assigned to the neoadjuvant treatment arm adhering to the guidelines set by the local ethical review board. Pre-therapeutic staging was performed including complete medical history and physical evaluation, digital rectal examination, endorectal ultrasound, rigid rectoscopy with two tumor biopsies, colonoscopy, abdominal ultrasound, abdominal and pelvic computed tomography and chest X-ray. Endoscopic ultrasound was performed by two experienced surgeons and was based on the degree of tumor infiltration through the rectal wall (T-level) according to standard criteria (Liersch at al. (2003) Chirurg 74, 224-34; Adams et a7. (1999) Dis Colon Rectum 42, 159-66; Glaser at al. (1990) Br J Surg 77, 883-7; Hunerbein at al. (2001) Eur J Ultrasound 13, 17-23). Only patients with uT-level 3 (n=22) and uT-level 4 (n=1) carcinomas located within 16 cm from the anocutaneous verge were included. The majority of the patients were diagnosed with uUICC III (n=16) carcinomas, and only seven patients were diagnosed as uUICC II. Two pre-therapeutical biopsies were taken from representative, adjacent areas of the tumors one of which was examined by one pathologist. All rectal cancers were histologically diagnosed as adenocarcinomas. The second biopsy was used for RNA extraction. All 23 patients randomly assigned to the neoadjuvant arm received a total dose of 50.4 Gy of radiation accompanied by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU 1000 mg per m2, days 1-5 and days 28-33) intravenous application. Details of the preoperative treatment modalities were described previously (Sauer et al. (2001) Strahlenther Onkol 177, 173-81). Standardized surgery was performed including total mesorectal excision (TME, (Heald et al. (1986) Lancet 1, 1479-82)) alter an interval of approximately five weeks after radiochemotherapy. The histological workup of surgical specimens was performed according to UICC standards (Sobin L H, Wittekind C. UICC: TNM classification of malignant tumors. 5 ed. New York: John Wiley & Sons, 1997). Tumor response was assessed based on T-level down-sizing (as performed by rectal ultrasound before radiochemotherapy and histomorphologically after surgery). Down-sizing was defined as the reduction of tumor infiltration for at least one T-level. The experimental design is summarized in FIG. 1. We have chosen the T-level classification as the international standard for rectal cancer staging. The clinical data and details of the response classification are summarized in Table 1. Additionally, three matched pairs of preoperative biopsies and resected tumor specimens from patients of the adjuvant treatment arm were analyzed to establish the degree of similarity of the bioptic material and resected specimen.

RNA Isolation and Expression Profiling Following rectal ultrasound, tumor biopsies were ascertained and stored for later isolation of RNA (Ambion, Austin, Tex.). Tumor material was in the range of 5 mg to 80 mg. RNA extraction was performed using TRIZOL (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) following standard procedures. High-quality RNA could be successfully extracted from all samples. In order to generate enough RNA for repeat hybridizations, inRNA was amplified using the RiboArrip RNA amplification kit (Arcturus, Mountain View, Calif.), which resulted in antisense mRNA amounts that averaged 40 μg. cRNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA incorporating aminoallyl-dUTP, Labeled cDNA was purified using Qiagen columns (QIAquick, PCR purification kit, Qiagen, Los Angeles, Calif.), followed by chemical coupling of Cy3 (Amersham, Piscataway, N.J.). Control cRNA was generated by amplification of a universal human reference mRNA pool (Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.; catalogue number 740000) and labeled as above using Cy5 (Amersham). RNA quantification and labeling efficiency was determined using the Nanodrop quantification device (Nanodrop, Rockland, Del.). Expression profiling was carried out on the NCI-cDNA arrays (9984 genes) as follows: 3.0 μg of Cy3 labeled test cDNA and 3.0 ng of Cy5 labeled control cDNA were hybridized at 42° C. overnight in specifically designed hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif.). After hybridization, slides were washed and scanned on an Axon scanner using GenePixPro (3.0) software (Axon Instruments, Inc., Union City, Calif.). Background subtraction and normalization was performed when submitting the data to the CIT/NIH-microarray database, mAdb (web site nciarray.nih.gov). Spot quality was assessed according to criteria in GenePixPro (3.0) software. Spots with a small size or low intensity in both the red and green channels were eliminated, as were genes with more than 50% of missing data. This a priori filtering to remove genes with unreliable signals resulted in a final tally of 9059 genes. For each patient sample two independent hybridizations were performed. Correlation coefficients of the technical repeat hybridizations were greater than 0.95, with one exception (P1, correlation coefficient of 0.87). C. Statistical Analysis All statistical analyses were done on the BRBArrayTools package for micro-array analysis developed at the Biometric Research Branch of the National Cancer Institute (Simon R, Peng A. BRBArrayTools, 2003). BRBArrayTools can be obtained from the web site linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB˜ArrayTools.html. Technical replicate expression profiles of the same tumor specimen were highly consistent and were averaged for analysis. A class comparison analysis was applied to determine which genes were differentially expressed between the two classes. For this we used a two-sample T-test with a randomized variance model (Wright G, Simon R. A random variance model for differential gene detection in small sample microarray experiments, 2003. Tech. Rep. 013, Biometric Research Branch, National Cancer Institute, at the web site linus.ncianh.gov/˜bib/TechReport.htm. The randomized variance model assumes that the variance of the expression of each gene is randomly drawn from an inverse-gamma distribution. For a small number of samples, this gives better results than assigning equal variance to all genes or attempting to estimate the variances separately for each gene. We applied six different classification methods to predict response: Compound Covariate Predictor (Radmacher et al. (2002) J Comput Biol 9, 505-11), Diagonal Linear Discriminant Analysis (Dudoit et al. (2002) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 77-87), 1 and 3-Nearest Neighbor classifiers (Devroye, L, Gyorfi L, G. Lugosi. A probabilistic theory of pattern recognition. New York: Springer, 1996), Nearest Centroid classifier and Support Vector Machine (Vapnik V N. Statistical learning theory. New York: John Wiley & Sons, Inc 1998). The genes that are differentially expressed at a p<0.001 level were used as predictive features in the classifiers. A leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was employed to estimate the prediction accuracy for each classification method. With LOOCV one sample is left out and the remaining samples are used to build a classifier, which would then be used to classify the left out sample. Both feature selection and classifier design was repeated each time a sample was left out. The fraction of samples that are classified correctly is an estimate of the classification accuracy. The significance of the classification results are calculated by permuting the class labels of the samples and then finding the fraction of times this re-labeling resulted in higher LOOCV classification accuracy. The method is described in detail in Radmacher et al, (Radmacher et al. (2002) J Comput Biol 9, 505-11). Example II Identification of Genes whose Expression is Correlated with Responsiveness to Radiochemotherapy In order to identify molecular signatures of responsiveness of rectal carcinomas to neoadjuvant, preoperative radiochemotherapy, we analyzed gene expression profiles of 23 tumor biopsies. The flow of sample collection, clinical diagnosis, and experimental design is depicted in FIG. 1. All patients participated in a randomized clinical trial aimed at comparing the relative benefits of adjuvant versus neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy of locally advanced rectal carcinoma. Since standardization of surgical procedure and evaluation of therapy response is critical, all patient samples Were collected from a single clinic (University Medical Center Göttineen, Germany), Before biopsy sampling, initial tumor staging was performed by rectal ultrasound, a procedure that, in the experience of the inventors, shows concordance with the histomorphological classification of tumor resections in more than 85% of cases (Liersch et al. (2003) Chirurg 24, 224-34). In all instances, duplet biopsies were ascertained and submitted to either histopathological evaluation or for the purpose of expression profiling. Neoadjuvant treatment, the histological diagnosis, and surgical resection of carcinomas were standardized as part of the clinical trial. To establish the degree of similarity of the bioptic samples and the surgically removed tumors, three matched pairs of biopsies and turners of patients from the adjuvant treatment aim were compared using gene expression profiling. Average correlation coefficients were in the range of 84%, indicating that in general the turner biopsies reflect the transcriptome of rectal carcinomas. Gene expression profiles of the tumors from patients assigned to the neoadjuvant arm of the study were established using 10 K cDNA arrays and then evaluated by class comparison analysis. In class comparison analysis, all samples were evaluated and genes that were differentially expressed in tumors with or without response were identified. The clinical data and response classification are listed in Table 1. Response classification was based on T-level down-sizing. Nine patients were considered responders (P1-P9) and 14 patients showed no T-level response (P10-P23). T-level down-sizing was supported by 54 genes (p<0.001), which were differentially expressed between the two response classes Classification results for T-level down-sizing were most accurate using the Compound Covariate Predictor and Diagonal Linear Discriminant analysis. Results are presented here for the Compound Covariate Predictor. Four patients were incorrectly classified, three of whom belonged to the non-response group but were classified as responders (P15, P21 and P23), while responder P1 was incorrectly placed in the non-response group. Class prediction using T-level down-sizing results in 83% correct assignment as to either responders or non-responders (p=0.03). Table 2 shows the classification accuracy obtained for the all six classifiers for the T-level down-sizing classification.

The positive predictive value (percentage of patients classified as responders who were true responders) is 73% and the negative predictive value (percentage of patients classified as non-responders who were true non-responders) is 92%. Table 3 provides the annotation of the 54 most significantly changed genes in class comparison analysis. 41 genes were down-regulated and 13 genes showed higher expression values in the group of responders.

UG cluster, unigene cluster. Genes 1-41 are expressed at lower levels in the responders, and genes 42-54 are expressed at higher levels in the responders. Gene 1 is the most statistically significant down-regulated gene and gene 41 is the least statistically significant down-regulated gene. Gene 42 is the most statistically significant up-regulated gene and gene 54 is the least statistically significant up-regulated gene. The results of a hierarchical cluster analysis of the 54 genes are presented pictorially in FIG. 2. Fifteen of the 54 genes are particularly highly correlated with the degree of responsiveness to radiochemotherapy (p<0.00032). These genes are indicated as genes 1-12 (down-regulated) and 42-44 (up-regulated). Several candidate genes have previously been analyzed by other groups for their potential to serve as predictors for response to radiation or chemotherapy. These include Ku70/80, ERCC1, TP53, DPYD (dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase), and TYMS (thymidylate synthase). The expression levels of these genes in our analysis, however, were not significantly different in groups of responders or non-responders based on T-level down-sizing. The 54 genes whose expression levels were most significantly changed represent members of several cellular pathways and map to multiple different chromosomes. Of particular interest are genes that encode proteins involved in DNA damage repair pathways, such as SMC1, which is involved in the S-phase checkpoint mediated by ATM (Yazdi et al. (2002) Genes Dev 16, 571-82; Kim et al. (2002) Genes Dev 16, 560-70). A number of genes were involved in microtubule organization. For instance, calmin has homology to calponin and dystrophin (Ishisaki et al. (2001) Genomics 74, 172-9). Cdc42 is a member of the Rho GTPase subfamily and triggers microtubule reorganization and cytoskeletal remodeling through GSK-3 and APC, two proteins involved in Wnt-signaling (Etienne-Maimeville et al., (2003) Nature; 421, 753-6; Harwood et al. (2003) Nat Cell Biol 5, 275-7). Filamin B is an integrator of cell mechanics and signaling and acts in the Rho signaling apparatus (Stossel et al. (2001) Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol 2, 138-45); villin proteins are involved in actin metabolism (Athman et al. (2002) Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol 283, G496-502); and kinectin 1 is a binding partner of kinesin, and belongs to a class of molecular motors involved in mitoses, axoplasmic transport and secretion (Karcher et al. (2002) Trends Cell Biol 12, 21-7). The preponderance of genes involved in microtubule organization cannot be explained by relative abundance of members of such gene families alone. Again, none of the previously used candidate genes were present in this list.
