Synthesis of N-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-{3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl}-N-propylacetamide (Compound 1)
(1-1) Synthesis of 3-chloro-N-propylaniline (Compound 1-1)
To a stirred solution of 3-chloroaniline (1 mL) and bromopropane (1 mL) in DMF (20 mL) was added potassium carbonate (3.9 g), and the mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 12 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was diluted by ethyl acetate (20 mL) and the whole was washed with saturated brine (20 mL × 2) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The filtrate was evaporated in vacuo and the resulting residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography eluting with hexane and ethyl acetate to give 3-chloro-N-propyl aniline (500 mg, yield 32%).
