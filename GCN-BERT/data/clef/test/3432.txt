DESCRIPTION Title of the Invention: LIQUID AQUEOUS COMPOSITION Technics.! Field [0001] The present invention belongs to the field of cancer immunotherapy, and relates to an aqueous liquid composition comprising WT1 protein-derived cancer antigen peptide having a cytotoxic Τ cell-inducing activity, and to stabilization of drug by the composition. Background Art [0002] Generally, the WT1 protein-derived cancer antigen peptide is a partial peptide derived from human WT1 protein consisting of 449 amino acids (SEQ ID NO: 2}, and is specifically a peptide consisting of 8 - 12 amino acids or a dimer thereof. It is presented to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen, and includes a peptide which is antigen-recognized by cytotoxic Τ cell (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte, hereinafter to be referred to as CTL). MHC in human is called human leukocyte antigen (HLA). [0003] Among the WT1 protein-derived partial peptides, a partial peptide consisting of 9 amino acids and shown by the sequence of WTI12ε-ΐ34 peptide Arg-Met-Phe-Pro-Asn-Ala-Pro-Tyr-Leu (SEQ ID NO: 1), and a modified peptide, wherein partial amino acid(s) is (are) modified (modified peptide), have been reported to be useful as peptides that bind to HLA to induce CTL (see patent documents 1-3, non-patent document 1). [0004] A cancer antigen protein and a cancer antigen peptide, which are generally used for cancer vaccine, are administered with an adjuvant (imrnunopotentiating agent) in many cases to induce CTL more efficiently, r ∩ ρ. ∩ c; ΐ \J t/ U O j However , it is often difficult to maintain stability, particularly stability in water, of the formulations comprising these proteins and peptides. Therefore, the formulations removed water by freeze-drying are generally selected. Nevertheless, freeze-dried formulations are disadvantageous from the aspects of production and cost, and also require an operation when in use such as adding water and the like. In view of the above, it is significant to develop a stable aqueous liquid composition that enables easy combination of a cancer antigen protein or cancer antigen peptide with various adjuvants depending on the object of use. [0006] As for the stabilization of a liquid, a freeze-dried formulation containing citric acid or methionine as a stabilizer of gonadotropin (see patent document 4), a formulation containing methionine as a stabilizer of G-CSF (see patent document 5) , and a formulation having pH 4 or below7 and containing succinic acid or tartaric acid as a stabilizer of G-CSF (see patent document 6} are disclosed. [0007] Furthermore, a formulation containing, as stabilizers of modified factor VIII polypeptide in solution, (1) pH adjuster to fall within the range of about 4.0'- about 8.0, (2) an antioxidant, and (3) calcium salt, magnesium salt is disclosed (see patent document 7). In addition, a formulation with improved stability, which contains a physiologically active medicament, methionine and a novel erythropoiesis stimulating protein is disclosed (see patent document 8). [0008] However, a stable aqueous liquid composition containing a partial peptide having the sequence shown by SEQ ID NO: 1 or a modified peptide thereof, which is of interest in the present invention, has not been known.

[0046] The "aqueous liquid composition" of the present invention is a liquid for preparing a cancer vaccine, which contains water as the main solvent and can be mixed with various adjuvants. While water is generally used as the solvent, a pharmacologically acceptable solvent such as ethanol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and the like can be partially mixed with water as long as the effect of the invention is not affected. Preferably, 'water alone is used as a solvent. [0047] The "peptide" in the present invention is a cancer antigen peptide for preparing a cancer vaccine, and means a peptide selected from the group consisting of (A) "peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence shown by the sequence of Arg-Met-Phe-Pro-Asn-Ala-Pro-Tyr-Leu (SEQ ID NO: 1)" and (Β) "peptide wherein, in the amino acid sequence shown by SEQ ID NO: 1, 1 to 3 amino acids are deleted, substituted and/or added, and having a cytotoxic Τ cell-inducing ability". Preferred is a peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence shown by (A) Arg-Met-Phe-Pro-Asn-Ala-Pro-Tyr-Leu (SEQ ID NO: 1). [0048] The "peptide consisting of 'the amino acid sequence shown by Arg-Met-Phe-Pro-Asn-Ala-Pro-Tyr-Leu {SEO ID NO: 1)" is a protein which is a gene product of cancer suppressor gene WTl of the Wilms'" tumor, which is specifically a peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence consisting of 9 amino acids of Arg-Met-Phe-Pro-Asn-Ala-Pro-Tyr-Leu (SEQ ID NO: 1) (WTl126-i34 peptide} from the partial peptide consisting of 449 amino acids (SEQ ID NO: 2) derived from human WT1 protein.

The alpha hydroxy acid, to be used in the present invention is preferably glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, tartaric acid or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof, more preferably tartaric acid or a pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof. While lactic acid, malic acid, and tartaric acid have optical isomers, an optically active form and racemate do not influence the effect of the invention. Tartaric acid is frequently used as an excipient for pharmaceutical products, and L-(+)tartaric acid described in the Japanese Pharmacopoeia (the 16th Edition) is preferable. [0054] In the aqueous liquid composition of the present invention, while the content of "alpha hydroxy acid" per volume is not particularly specified, it is preferably 1 --- 100 mM, more preferably 1 - 50 mM, most preferably 1 - 25 mM.

[0100] [Experimental Example 5] Confirmation of specific CTL-inducing activity The aqueous liquid compositions 36, 37 and 38 were mixed with adjuvants to give cancer vaccine compositions. [0101] 1) Preparation of cancer vaccine compositions al, a2 As adjuvant a, incomplete Freund's adjuvant was used. Aqueous liquid composition 36 was diluted 1.7-fold with peptide-free 10 mM tartaric acid + 50 mM methionine solution. 450 μΧ, of foregoing mixture was taken in a glass syringe (Top Corp.), and the syringe was connected with a joint to another glass syringe containing 450 pL of adjuvant a. The inner cylinder of the both glass syringes was alternately pressed thereinto 30 times or more to emulsify the solution, whereby cancer vaccine composition al was obtained. Similarly, aqueous liquid composition 38 was diluted 1.7-fold with peptide-free 10 mM tartaric acid + 200 mM methionine solution , and processed using adjuvant a under similar conditions to give cancer vaccine composition a2. 2) Preparation of cancer vaccine compositions bl, fc-2 Ethyl oleate (96.5 g), sorbitan monooleate (17.5 g) , polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 10 (4.5 g) , concentrated glycerin (1.5 g) , and 25 mM' aqueous sodium dihydrogen phosphate solution (20.0 g) were taken in a 300 ml glass tall beaker in advance. Then, the mixture was stirred using CLEAMIX CLM-1.5 (Μ Technique Co., Ltd.) at 10000 rpm for 5 rain to give adjuvant b. Then, 400 μ1 of aqueous liquid composition 37, and 930 μ1 of adjuvant b were mixed by a test tube mixer (touch mixer ΜΤ-51, Yamato Scientific Co., Ltd.) to give cancer vaccine composition bl. Also, aqueous liquid composition 38 and adjuvant b were processed under similar conditions to give cancer vaccine composition b2. 3} Preparation of cancer vaccine compositions cl, c,2 Ethyl oleate (49.0 g), octyldodecyl myristate (49.0 g), sorbitan monooleate (7.0 g), glycerol monooleate (9.8 g), polyoxyethylene hydrogenated castor oil 20 (1.4 gj , concentrated glycerin (1.4 g), and 25 mM aqueous sodium dihydrogen phosphate solution (22.4 g) were taken in a 300 mL glass tall beaker in advance. Then, the mixture was stirred using CLEAMIX CLM-1.5 (Μ Technique Co., Ltd.) at 10000 rpm for 5 min to give adjuvant c.

Also, aqueous liquid composition 38 and adjuvant c were processed under similar conditions to give cancer vaccine composition c2. 4) CTL-inducing activity evaluation The specific CTL-inducing ability of 6 kinds of cancer vaccine compositions (al - c2) prepared in the above-mentioned 1) to 3) was evaluated using HLA-A^OlOl transgenic mouse (Eur. J. Immunol.: 34, 3060, 2004). 100 μ1 of each cancer vaccine composition (600 μg as peptide dose) was intradermally administered to HLA-A*02Q1 transgenic mouse from the base of the tail. Three mice were used for each group. The spleen was isolated 7 days after the administration, and the splenocytes were prepared. A. part of the splenocytes was pulsed with 100 junol/L peptide (1) for 1 hr The pulsing means that peptide (1) was added to splenocytes to allow for binding of antigen peptide to HLA on the cell surface Splenocytes without pulsing with peptide (1) and the above-mentioned splenocytes pulsed with peptide were mixed, plated on a 24 well plate at 7.8*10b cells/well, and cultured. As the culture medium, RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 10 mM HEPES, 20 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium, pyruvate, 1 mM MEM non-essential amino acid, 1% MEM vitamin, and 55 μΜ 2~ mercaptoethanol was used, and the cells were cultured for 5 days. The administered peptide-specific CTL activity of the cultured splenocytes was measured by D1Cr release assay (J. Immunol.: 159, 4753, 1997). For stable expression of HLA-A*0201 and H-2Db chimeric MHC class I molecule, cell line EL4-HHD cell prepared in the Institut Pasteur by gene transfer into mouse lymphoma-derived cell line (J. Exp. Med.: 185, 2043, 1997) was used. The target cells were &1Cr-labeled with 3.7 MBq/5xl05 ceils for 1 hr, the aforementioned peptide was added to 167 jjmol/L and the cells was further pulsed for 1 hr. In addition, the target cells not pulsed with the aforementioned peptide (non-pulsed) were 51Cr-labeled for 2 hr to give control target cells. The labeled target cells and the splenocytes prepared earlier were mixed at a ratio of 1:20, cultured for 4 hr, and the CTL-inducing activity (namely, cytotoxicity) was determined from the ratio of the injured target cells, The results are shown in Fig. 1, The cytotoxicity is shown by the mean value of 3 mice for each administration group. As shown in Fig. 1, the group administered with a cancer vaccine composition prepared using the aqueous liquid composition of the present invention showed high cytotoxicity against the target cells pulsed with the aforementioned peptide, but showed low cytotoxicity against the control target cells not pulsed with the aforementioned peptide, which has clarified induction of peptide-specific CTL. The results snow that the aqueous liquid composition, of the present invention combined with various adjuvants activates induction of CTL specific to c aηcer a ηtigen.
