DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to FIGS. 1 through 5 thereof, a new exercise cycling assembly embodying the principles and concepts of an embodiment of the disclosure and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be described. As best illustrated in FIGS. 1 through 5, the inverted exercise cycling assembly 10 generally comprises a plurality of support members 12. Each of the support members 12 is coupled to an adjacently positioned one of the support members 12. The support members 12 may be arranged to form a rectangle. A plurality of legs 14 is provided. Each of the legs 14 is coupled to and extends downwardly from an associated juncture 16 formed between adjacently positioned ones of the support members 12. A bottom end 18 of each of the legs 14 has an end cap 20 coupled thereto. The end caps 20 are configured for positioning on a ground surface. A first crossbar 22 is coupled to and extends between a first 24 and second 26 one of the support members 12. A second crossbar 28 is coupled to and extends between a first pair 30 of legs 14. A third crossbar 32 is coupled to and extends between a second pair 34 of legs 14. The first 22, second 28 and third 32 crossbars are positioned parallel with respect to each other. The support members 12, the legs 14, and each of the first 22, second 28 and third 32 crossbars define a support assembly 36 configured for positioning upon the ground surface. The support assembly 36 may have a height between approximately 100.0 centimeters and 125.0 centimeters; a length between approximately 100.0 centimeters and 125.0 centimeters; and a width between approximately 100.0 centimeters and 135.0 centimeters. A post 38 is coupled to and extends downwardly from the first crossbar 22. The post 38 has a first section 40 and a second section 42 that may be slidable relative to each other wherein the post 38 is telescopic. A lower end 44 of the post 38 may taper outwardly. A fixing pin 46 secures the first 40 and second 42 sections together at a selectable distance from the first crossbar 22 when the fixing pin 46 is passed through aligned holes in each of the first section 40 and the second section 42. A cycling frame 48 is coupled to the lower end 44 of the post 38. A flywheel 50 is rotatably coupled to the cycling frame 48. The flywheel 50 is coupled to and extends outwardly from a front end 51 of the cycling frame 48. A pair of pedals 52 is coupled to the cycling frame 48. Each of the pedals 52 comprises a crank 54 and a body 56. Each of the cranks 54 has a first end 58 coupled to and extending outwardly from opposite sides 60, 62 of the cycling frame 48 and a second end 64 coupled to an associated body 56. The pedals 52 are mechanically coupled to the flywheel 50 such that rotation of the pedals 52 causes the flywheel 50 to rotate. A drive belt 66 is coupled to the cycling frame 48. The drive belt 66 is mechanically coupled to the flywheel 50 in a conventional manner such that rotation of the drive belt 66 about the cycling frame 48 causes the flywheel 50 to rotate. Alternatively, a drive chain may be used in place of the drive belt 66. A rear axle 68 is coupled to the cycling frame 48 and extends between the pedals 52. The rear axle 68 is operationally coupled to the pedals 52 wherein the pedals 52 urge the rear axle 68 to rotate. A front axle 70 is coupled to the cycling frame 48 and extends through the flywheel 50. The front axle 70 is operationally coupled to the pedals 52 wherein the pedals 52 urge the front axle 70 to rotate. A pair of plates 72 is coupled to the cycling frame 48. The flywheel 50 is positioned between each of the plates 72. A tension knob 74 is coupled to the cycling frame 48. The tension knob 74 is operationally coupled to the flywheel 50 wherein the tension knob 74 is adjustable to selectively engage the flywheel 50. The tension knob 74 is configured to selectively adjust an amount of frictional engagement of the plates 72 against the flywheel 50. A pair of handlebars 76 is coupled to the cycling frame 48. The handlebars 76 extend downwardly from the cycling frame 48. The handlebars 76 are configured for positioning in spaced relationship to the ground surface. A grip 78 is coupled to each of the handlebars 76. In use, as stated above and shown in the Figures, a user positions the support assembly 36 on a ground surface. A height of the post 38 is adjusted by sliding the first 40 and second sections 42 relative to each other, while the fixing pin 46 is used to secure the first 40 and second sections 42 together. The user lies with a back to the ground surface underneath the cycling frame 48, places his feet upon the pedals 52, his hands upon the handlebars 76, and then rotates the pedals 52 using his feet and legs. The tension knob 74 is adjusted to select an amount of frictional engagement of the plates 72 against the flywheel 50. The user can also grasp the handlebars 76 to perform sit-ups or crunches from the ground surface. In this manner, the assembly 10 allows a user to exercise his legs, stomach, and buttocks while laying on a ground surface without putting stress on the user's body. With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of an embodiment enabled by the disclosure, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by an embodiment of the disclosure. Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the disclosure. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the disclosure to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the disclosure. 1.
