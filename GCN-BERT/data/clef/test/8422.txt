Pneumothorax device Field of the Invention The invention comprises a device for treating pneumothorax, also known as a thoracic vent or a chest drain. In particular, the invention is a device for treating pneumothorax in a ηοηclinical or ambulatory context including but not limited to a domestic context. In particular, the invention is a device for treating pneumothorax of the following types: simple, iatrogenic, traumatic and spontaneous. In particular, the device is for use in human patients. In particular, the device is an apical drain. Background and prior art Chest drainage treatments of pneumothorax are common clinical practice. The widespread method in use is to aspirate from the cavity first, then place a drain. A popular means of doing this is via the use of the Seldinger technique. Here, the desired cavity - such as the pleural cavity - is punctured with a sharp, hollow needle called a veress needle. A roundtipped guide wire is then advanced through the lumen of the veress needle, and the veress needle is withdrawn. A "sheath" or blunt cannula or catheter is introduced, in order to act as a drainage tube. After passing a sheath or tube, the guide wire is withdrawn. Then aspiration can begin, perhaps via suction generated by a syringe or a mechanical device. Whilst a widespread and usefully employable technique, the apparatus used is bulky and does not lend itself to use in an outpatient or an ambulatory context. Pneumothorax is a condition which may need treating over a protracted period, and as such, there is a real need for a device which can be employed quickly and in a variety of non-clinical contexts, such that pneumothorax, and particularly acute cases, can be treated effectively. To the Applicant's knowledge, the closest prior art is Tru-close Thoracic vent system, made by Uresil LLC. US4664660 provides a vent for draining fluids from body cavities and in particular the pleural cavity. The vent described therein includes a vented housing having a fluid receiving chamber, an anti-reflux valve mounted to the housing and a catheter which extends for the housing and is in communication with the chamber through the anti-reflux valve. The apparatus is used by first inserting a solid trocar into the end of the catheter. A skin incision is then prepared and the trocar/catheter assembly is introduced into the pleural space through the incision. When the trocar is removed from the catheter, fluid drains from the pleural cavity through the catheter and the vented housing. Other apparatuses for draining fluids from body cavities and in particular the pleural cavities are disclosed in US patent numbers 447235, 4404924, 4164938, 4944724 and 5356386. In is in relation to these and other problems that the present invention seeks to present solutions. Summary of the invention In a first broad, independent aspect, the invention comprises a pneumothorax device, the device comprising a manifold, the manifold comprising a needle introduction port, a catheter port, and a linear passage running between the introduction port and the catheter port, a second passage extending from an intersection on the linear passage to an evacuation port; a fluid path extending from the catheter port and through a portion of the linear passage; and a valve on the linear passage between the intersection and the introducing port, a catheter in fluid communication with the connecting port and extending in use outwards from the manifold, a one-way valve in fluid communication with the evacuation port, and a reservoir in fluid communication with the evacuation port, and wherein the valve comprises a shutter which obstructs the entire diameter of the passage between the linear passage and the exterior of the device and may be opened by applying an actuating force onto the shutter. The device advantageously provides means of quick and easy installation. All the user need do is place the device on the outer wall surrounding the cavity to be entered and remove the cannula from the rest of the device, whereby streamlining the procedure of its installation. The valve advantageously opens from being pushed and therefore provides this straightforward and efficient point of ingress for a cannula and particularly a veress needle. A further advantage of such a device is that it provides an integrated single packet solution to the problem of treating pneumothorax, and therefore offers a marked advantage over the use of a kit of different parts or a device which implements bulky external medical equipment. The device of the invention therefore lends itself particularly well to treating the patient as an outpatient or in an otherwise ambulatory manner. The device is designed in order that a practitioner can aspirate and have a working drain whilst x-rays and other procedures are performed, then if required leave in situ. In addition the provision of such a valve allows the drainage of the pneumothorax if the one-way valve and vent become compromised. Preferably, the valve is opened by pushing onto the shutter, in a direction substantially towards the distal end of the catheter. This allows for the valve to be opened by the introduction of an item to be used for treatment, such as a syringe barrel, thus striking out the need for a further valve opening action to be done - the two actions are combined such that Preferably, the invention further comprises a removable cannula with a grip at a proximal end, and an external diameter which his no greater than the diameter of the linear passage and no greater than the internal diameter of the catheter, the cannula being situated inside the linear passage and running through the passage and the internal bore of the catheter, with the grip projecting from the introduction port and wherein the cannula obstructs the shutter of the valve, such that it cannot close. A device preloaded with a cannula is quicker and easier to implement in the scenarios outlined above. More preferably, the valve is biased shut and automatically closes upon removal of the cannula from the device. The valve, which is biased shut, advantageously seals the aperture into which it might be possible for elements including dirt and bacteria to enter the patient's chest cavity, shut. A valve which is biased shut in this way is markedly advantageous over alternative means such as a bung in that it is automatic. In contract a bung requires the manual placement and operation, including the application of pressure to stick it in. This is particularly useful in circumstances where the pneumothorax device must be used in a hurry or in an emergency. Preferably, the cannula is a veress needle, the veress needle comprising an inner probe with a rounded tip. The use of a veress needle of this configuration protects the patient from injury during movement of the device. Preferably, the cannula comprises a tip and wherein the tip is connected to a visual indicator system and wherein when the tip is obstructed, an indication is made. Pneumothorax Preferably, the invention further comprises a positive pressure relief valve. Preferably, the valve is a positive pressure relief valve. Advantageously the provision of a positive pressure release valve allows for the emergency release of fluid in situations wherein pressure builds up in the plural cavity. This can be particularly important in an outpatient context wherein the valve might automatically release the pressure without the need to be operated by a clinician. Preferably, the device further comprises a manometer. More preferably, the manometer comprises a portion of the catheter. An integrated manometer and moreover a manometer integrated into the catheter portion of the device is advantageous in that pressure can be monitored inside the plural cavity, which can be useful both in order to manage patient wellbeing in clinical context and also in terms of the provision of diagnostic data. Preferably, the catheter has a mass of between 7.49g and 8.51g and the veress needle has a mass of between 17.49g and 18.51g. The combination of mass ranges of catheter and needle in this instance give the best combination of drainage with superior insertion characteristics - i.e. requiring less force to insert through the chest wall. Preferably, the catheter is curved along its length. More preferably, the catheter is a pig-tailed catheter. The provision of a curved catheter and moreover a pigtailed catheter minimises the risk of occlusion after insertion. Preferably, the device further comprises a case, said case containing the manifold, and wherein the case has a substantially flat lower surface for mounting to a patient's body, but is otherwise substantially curved. Such a case provides fewer protruding corners and edges which might be knocked by a careless or otherwise and impaired patient, or during an emergency scenario. Lessening the risk of such knocks of course positively impacts on patient wellbeing and improves the lifespan of the device. Preferably, the device further comprises an adhesive mount for adhering and mounting the device to a patient's body and wherein the adhesive mount is substantially composed of a hydrocolloid material. Advantageously this fixation device reduces risk of the accidental displacement of the catheter. Safe anchoring and therefore stable protection of the catheter is provided for a week or more by such a fixation device. The device reduces catheter movement and consequent enlargement of the puncture site. The device further enables the patient to shower with the catheter inserted. Finally this fixation device prevents contamination of the puncture site from environment. Preferably, the reservoir comprises an air-permeable but water tight membrane. More preferably, the membrane comprises a hydrophobic material. Preferably, the membrane is releasably attachable. The provision of the membrane allows for the constant relief of air pressure bare through, whilst the liquid is removed by other means. The invention also comprises a pneumothorax device, substantially as described herein, with reference to and as illustrated by any appropriate combination of the text and /or drawings. The invention will now be described in detail with reference to the following figures. Brief Description of the Figures Figure 1 is a diagrammatic cross sectional side view of the invention; Figure 2 is a diagrammatic perspective view of the invention; Figure 3 is a diagrammatic plan view of the invention; Figure 4 is a diagrammatic exploded perspective view of the invention; and Figure 5 is a further diagrammatic perspective exploded view of the invention. Detailed Description of the preferred embodiments. The device of the present invention is directed principally to embodiments of the invention suited for locating and draining fluids from the pleural cavity. However, the device could be used, with appropriate adaptation for finding and/or introducing and / or extracting fluids relative to other body cavities including the brain epidural and subdural spaces, the brain ventricles, the bladder, the pelvis, the gallbladder, blood vessels or the spinal epidural space. An embodiment of the device is illustrated in the figures. Thus at figure 1 there is the device, indicated generally at 2. The pneumothorax device (subsequently "device") 2 is predominantly for the aspiration of air, but can be used to aspirate water and other fluids. The device 2 comprises, in its principal parts a manifold 4, a reservoir 6, a one-way valve 8 and a catheter 10. In preferred embodiments, including that shown here, the device 2 comprises a removable cannula 12, which in particularly preferred embodiments is a veress needle 14. In particular, the device 2 is designed to be inserted in a percutaneous manner into the 2nd intercostal space - thus the length of veress needle 14 and catheter 10 are dimensioned with regard to the proximity of the heart and muscular tissue adjacent the operational space in a typical range of patient pleural cavity sizes. The manifold 4 comprises a needle introduction port 16 and a catheter port 18. The two are linked by a linear passage 20 which runs between them. The linear passage comprises a narrower portion 21 distal the needle introduction port 16 and wider portion 23 proximal the needle introduction port, the narrower portion 21 and wider portion 23 being joined by frusto-conical portion 25. The needle introduction port 16 comprises a valve 22, which regulates flow through the linear passage. The valve comprises a shutter 24, which serves to obstruct the passage of flow when it is closed, but when opened allows the free flow of fluids along the linear passage 20 and out of the needle introduction port16. The shutter 24 may be overcome by being pushed from the direction of the needle introduction port 16 to the direction of the catheter port 18. In preferred embodiments, as here, the device 12 is presented to the user with a preinstalled veress needle 14, such that the shutter 24 is open. When the veress needle 14 or other type of cannula is removed, the shutter 24 will close and the valve 22 will therefore be in the closed position. In this embodiment, the veress needle 14 comprises handle portions 100 which, in use may be placed behind index and middle fingers during insertion or removal of the veress needle 14, for a better grip. The word "shutter" is used to denote anything which is capable of being shut and reopened. It may comprise a flap, or a resiliently deformable material of a known type which can be overcome in order for the valve 22 to be brought into an open position, but will revert into a closed position, blocking the linear passage 20 if the overcoming force is removed. Thus the shutter 24 can be operated by the insertion of another element of the given part of the pneumothorax procedure, such as the introduction of a cannula, including a veress needle, a syringe, guide wire apparatus, the valve interface means of a suction device, or other such apparatus. Alternatively, a button or other interface may be pushed a first time to open and a second time to close. Alternatively, any other, known, opening and closing means for valve 22 may be employed. In this embodiment, the valve 22 is a slip valve, comprising a socket connection 26 which may further comprise a luer lock. The shutter 24 may be locked off by locking means 28, which advantageously prevents accidental opening of the linear passage 20 and which may again comprise a luer lock. Some embodiments will comprise a pre-loaded syringe for emergency aspiration of fluids. The syringe (barrel) will be attached to a port 30 and on veress needle 14, such that aspiration can take place through the hollow needle 32 of veress needle 14. In use, the syringe can be used for a first, perhaps urgent, aspiration and then withdrawn from the linear passage 20 of the device 2, thereby causing valve 22 to shut and releasably seal the linear passage 20. The catheter 10 is of a known material and will usually be made of a polymeric component, in tandem with any other material. The catheter 10 is preferably of a curved type and in particular a "pig tail” type, which, as shown in figure 6, comprises a stiffer, straightened portion 34 projecting from the case 36 of the device 2 and terminates in a less stiff, curled portion 38. The curled portion 38 curls inward on itself, such that apertures 40 through which aspiration will take place lie within the inner perimeter 42 of a near circle formed by the curled portion 38 of the catheter. The curled portion 38 comes to a pointed tip 44. This combination of features serves to minimise the invasiveness of the procedure and to militate against the damaging of tissue adjacent the catheter 10. In preferred embodiments, the catheter 10 has a mass of between 7.49g and 8.51g and the veress needle 14 has a mass of between 17.49g and 18.51g. The catheter 10 may further comprise a manometer (not shown) such that it is able to measure fluctuations in the pleural pressure of the user whilst treatment is taking place. The veress needle 14 runs along the inside of catheter 10 .The needle 14 comprises an outer cannula 80, wherein the outer cannula 80 has a bevelled needle point 82 for cutting through tissues of the intercostal space. A spring-loaded, inner probe/stylet 84 is positioned within the outer cannula 80. This inner probe/stylet 84 has a fully rounded dull tip 86 to protect any viscera from injury by the sharp, outer cannula 80. The veress needle 14 is configured such that direct pressure on the tip 86 -as when penetrating through tissue-pushes the inner probe/stylet 84 into the shaft 88 of the outer cannula 80. The veress needle 14 of the invention has a visual indicator system (not shown) to show when this is occurring, for example indicating red as the cutting edge is exposed. When the tip 86 of the needle 14 enters a space such as the pleural space, the dull, inner probe/stylet 84 springs forward, again the visual indicator here will turn to green as the organs are protected from the cutting edge. The safety feature significantly cuts down the risk of tissue damage during the insertion of the device 2, and as such, the safety indication system described herein offers a significant advantage. The probe/stylet 84 has two side eyes 90, one of which is visible in the diagram and a central passage 92 in fluid connection with the linear passage 20, thereby allowing the flow of gas and fluid to the reservoir; these allow the clinician to check that the needle 14 is correctly located. A further passage 50 intersects with linear passage 20. This passage is also linear in this embodiment, but need not be. This further passage 50 is formed as a crossing 52 and leads in a first direction to discharge port 54 and in a second direction to indicator 56, which in this instance is a diaphragm. The diaphragm 56 deflects upwards when the catheter 10 tip 44 enters the pleural space, due to the change in pressure It then continues to fluctuate with respiration as the intrapleural pressure varies from > +2mm Hg to <-2mm Hg. When the signal diaphragm stays in the down position and the patient is asymptomatic the pneumothorax may be resolved. The diaphragm 56 is clearly visible, as it can be seen under transparent portion 58 of case 60, and is located on the surface located, in use, in an upward direction (typically the direction nearest the patient's head). The sensitivity of the diaphragm 56 can be changed by varying the thickness of the diaphragm 56. The discharge port 54 allows for discharging from reservoir 6. The reservoir is linked to the manifold 4 via one-way valve 55, which allows for the flow of fluid from catheter 10 via crossing 52 to reservoir 6, but does not allow it to flow out of the reservoir 6. Flow out of reservoir is via discharge port 54 in the case of all fluids and in the case of vapours only, through membrane 62. The membrane 62 is overlaid by a vent 64, which is itself overlaid by portion of the case 60, which is characterised by apertures or gaps, such that gaseous fluids can pass through it. The membrane 62 is made of a hydrophobic material in order that less fluid discharges through the reservoir 6. In other words, the single item one way valve and vent combination prevents air and fluid from returning to the pleural space, whilst allowing air to escape the unit, but keeping fluid contained ready for safe drainage. The one way valve 8 is a flutter or Heimlich valve. The vent 64 may advantageously be offset from the vertical axis of the device 2, such that air may be ejected from the device more efficiently, by making the angle of the membrane closer to the direction of airflow into the reservoir 6. In some embodiments, the discharge port 54 is a needleless port. In use, a syringe barrel having an appropriate attachment means is attached to the needleless discharge port 54 and then used in a conventional fashion to aspirate fluid from reservoir 6 of the device 2. The discharge port 54 will comprise closure means such as a luer lock. In the event that one way valve and vent become compromised, drainage of the pneumothorax can continue via the use of positive pressure release valve. The device 2 is housed in a case 60, which has a substantially planar surface 66 for bringing into contact with the patient's chest and a substantially continuously curved surface 68, which is not in contact with the patient's chest. The case 60 is substantially of a figure of eight shape. The device 2 is attached to the patient's chest with adhesive hydrocolloid fixation device 70. The fixation 70 carries additional padding 72 surrounding the base of the catheter 10. The fixation 70 will have its adhesive side 74 covered by a removable liner prior to being fixed onto the patient. 1.
