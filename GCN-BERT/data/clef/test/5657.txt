Step 1. tert-butyl 1-(1H-imidazol-2-yl)-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-4-ylcarbamate
To a solution of tert-butyl 1-formyl-2-oxabicyclo[2.2.2]octan-4-ylcarbamate (50 mg, 0.20 mmol, Advanced Chemblocks) in ammonia (7 N/MeOH) (1 mL, 7.0 mmol) was added glyoxal (67 Î¼L, 0.59 mmol) and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The volatiles were removed in vacuo and the residue was partitioned between EtOAc and water. The layers were separated and the organic layer was washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified by flash chromatography (0-15% MeOH/DCM) to afford the title compound (24 mg, 42%).
