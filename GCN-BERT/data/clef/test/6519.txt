The present iirvantiDn relates to eleotrioal apparatus and Is, more epeoifioally, concerneâ with, a process for insulatijag ooils for eleotrioal purposes and the prodluot produeed hy such process. A principal oUeot of this invention is the provision of a ooil which will have highly refractory insulation, be unaffected by lubricating oils and certain gases, particularly those suitable as refrigerants, such as sulphur d±oxide, methyl formate, methyl chloride and the lite, and one in which the turns are rigidly united and adequately insulated from each other so that the whole: is a oompaot, solid, well insulated unit. My invention will be mare fully set forth in the follow¬ ing description, reference being had to the accompanying drawingar, and its soope will be pointed out in the olaims annexed to and forming part of this spécification. In the drawirtgs, Fig. 1 is a perspective view, partially broken for the sake of Qlearness, of a stator of a dynamo eleotrlo machine the windings thereof being insulated in aooordance with ray invention; Fig. 2 is a diagrammatic sectional view of an apparatus which may be employed in carrying out the process of my invention and showing a stator therein and illustrating the first steps in the process ; Fig. 3 is an enlarged fragmentary cross seotito of a portion of the wx; stator illustrating diagranuiatioally the condition of the windings at the stage in the process corresponding to Fig. 2; Fig. 4 îa* a view similar to Fig. 2 but illustrating later steps in the process; Fig. 5 is a view similar to Fig. 3 but showing the windings at the stage of the treatment correspond¬ ing to Fig. 4; Fig. 6 is a view similar to Fig. 2 but illus¬ trating the baking operation; and Fig. 7 is a view similar to Fig. 3 but showing the windings as they appear completely insulated by means of the process of the present invention. D-44,606 Referring to Fig. 1 of the drawings, there is shown and generally indioated by the numeral 1 a stator of a dynamo electric machine as representative of an eleotrloal apparatus having a coil or winding which is insulated and which may te treated in accordance with my invention. The stator comprises a magnetic body comprising laminations 2 provided with openings or slots 3 therein. Shields 4 com¬ posed /preferably of non-magnetic metal» such as brass, are provided in order to protect the insulation, designated generally at J5, surrounding the end turns of the winding. (These shields are secured to the stator by any suitable means, for example by soldering thereto as shown at 6. ïTon-magnetie metallic wedges 7 are provided in the slots 3 as shown more clearly In Figs. 3,£ and 7. In carrying out the process of my invention the stator Is first wound in the usual manner, I employ fibrous covered conductors, the conductors being preferably copper and the covering thereon a cellulosie material, such as paper, cotton or other fibrous material or such a cellulosie material admixed with a substance, such as asbestos fibres. The slot insulation may be of the same material as the covering of the conductors but is not necessarily restricted to such material but may include such materials as mica, lacquers and the lOce, The stator having been wound and the end shields fasten¬ ed thereto I then introduce therein an inert inorganic filling material, such as silica» preferably of 20-30 mesh. This may be conveniently done through ppenings 8 in the shields. Instead of employing silica I may use any other infcrt filling material, which should not be too fine, as for example alumina, boron nitride, thoria, and the like. After this inert material has been introduced the holes or openings 8 are closed in any suitable way, as for example by soldering, The stator is now ready for the impregnation steps. D-44,6o6 lîh© stator is placed in a suitable receptacle 9 provided with a removable cover 10, and inlet and outlet pipes, 11 and 12, reapeotively, for the admission and withdrawal of the impregnating medium or agent, the pipes 11 aBd 12 having suitable controlling va3.ves 1? and 14, respectively. The reoeptaole 9 is also provided with a pipe 15 leading to a valve mechanism 16 which is operati-rely connected to and controls suction and pressure lines 1? and 18 respectively. The stator having been placed in the receptacle the latter is closed and the valve 16 manipulated to oonneot the reoeptaole with the source of suction. After the receptacle Is evacuated the valve 15 is opened to admit the impregnating agent 19 which is introduced until the stator is completely submerged therein (see Fig. 4). The suction supply is now cut off. As the Impregnating agent I emplioy a material, such aa sodium silicate, potassium silicate, and the li&e. 1 prefer to employ sodium silicate because of its general availability and comparative cheapness. It acts as an excellent coating material and sets to a rigid bond. I have found that a àodium silicate solution made from sodium sllieate Known to the trade as '♦IT" brand and having a ratio of Fa20 to Si02 of 1 : 3.25 the solution being of specific gravity of approximately I.37 gives excellent results, but it is of course understood that my invention is not restricted to the use of this material nor to this particular specific gravity. The valve mechanism 16 is now manipulated so that pressure is supplied through the line 18. While the pressure may vary I have found that the application of about 10O pounds pressure for about one hour is satisfactory. If higher pressures are employed the time is decreased. The impregnating agent enters the stator through the slots 3 and impregnates the covered conductors and the inert filling 3- D-44,6oé material. Fig. > illustrates on an enlarged soale and somewhat diagrammatioally the oondition of the Coil or windings after the inert filling material has "been suppjiect, while Fîg. shows similarly the condition of the windings while the stator is being treated as shown in Fig. 4. After Impregnation the stator is removed and placed in a suitable baking oven, such as the electricsally heated oven shown in Fig. 6. Che oven ts arranged so that the stator is heat treated in an inert invironment, that Is, the stator receives the heat treatment in an inert gaseous medium or in a vacuum, Ihe importance of this will be pointed out more fully hereafter. The temperature at which the stator is baked Is such that the oellulosio material is decomposed and the Impregnating agent is caused to firmly set and bind the Individual oonductors in place and also to bind the inert filling medium. I have found that a baking temperature of about 400° C. is satisfaotoiy although this temperature is not fixed and may be varied. During the heat treatment in the inert atmosphere the cellulosic material surrounding: the conductors of the coil decomposes to a stable compound of indeterminate composition but which is an excellent insulator. At the same time that this decomposition takes place the inert filling material is firmly bonded together by the impregnating agent, which also bonds the insulation covering firmly on the conductors. It is important that the heat treatment be oarried out in the absence of air else the cellulosic, material surrounding the conduotors will not decompose the stable produce obtained by the process of my invention but will oxidize and in most oases completely "burn out". In Fig. 7 I have indicated on an enlarged scale and somewhat diagrammatioally the coil or windings Insulated after the heat treatment. ,, " £ >0 K.' *-*• ,-' D-44,606 The stator is again impregnated and talced as above. The seoond impregnation improves the maahanieal strength of the decomposed oellulosio material surrounding and insulating the individual conductors, the impregnating agent acting also as a binder. This decomposed oellulosio material also acts as an absorbent for the impregnating agent and prevents intumescence. Further impregnations and baMng operations may be carried out as it is not my intention to restrict the number of impregnations and baking operations to two, although two such operations will ordinarily bo found sufficient. In some oases, after the final baling operation has been carried out it may be desirable, though not necessary, to impregnate the coil or winding withuamolten inorganic insulating material of fairly high melting point i.e. over about 100° C but below about e00oG., and which is insoluble or but slightly soluble in water, such as lead borate, lead chloride, sulphur and the liKe, in order to completely seal any minute pores which may be present. This is carried out by simply impregnating with the material which is allowed to solidify in air. Such a treatment will further improve the moisture resistance and mechanical qualities of the unit. A coil formed and insulated in acoordanae with ray invention is highly refractory in nature, and unaffected by lubricating oils. Such a coil ,is furthermore resistant ; to and unaffected by certain refrigerants, for example, sulphur dioxide, methyl formate, methyl chloride and the like, so that the coil is particularly suited for use in any electrical apparatus enclosed in a refrigerating system» i5 ,<<•-'"J *-~J D-44,6o6 What I claim as "new and desire to secure by Letters Patent of the Dominion of Canada, is: 1.
