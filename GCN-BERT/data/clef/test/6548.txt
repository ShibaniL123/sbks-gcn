CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is based upon, and claims the benefit of U.S. provisional patent application 61/714,321 filed Oct. 16, 2012, which is hereby incorporated by reference. STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT N/A BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Currently there are over two million boys ranging in age from 4 to 18 playing some form of youth baseball in this country. Another 1.3 million girls are currently playing some type of youth softball. Unfortunately, a significant number of these boys and girls do not know how to throw a baseball or softball properly. Not employing the correct mechanics in throwing a ball can, over time, create bad throwing habits which will affect a player's quality of play, as well as potentially cause physical injuries to their elbow, arm, and wrist. The correct mechanics for throwing a ball are that when one draws back their arm, in preparing to throw the ball, the palm of their throwing hand should face behind them as should their thumb. This hand/thumb position is sometimes referred to as “pointing to the outfield”. The present invention is directed to a teaching aid useful for teaching people of all ages and skill levels, but especially younger persons, how to throw a ball correctly. The teaching aid is made for anyone participating in (playing) baseball or softball. It has been developed to help boys and girls, young men and women, teenagers, and high school baseball or softball players develop and maintain the proper mechanics in throwing a ball. The invention provides a useful tool for parents and coaches (particularly pitching coaches), and anybody else wanting to teach or learn how to throw a ball correctly. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention comprises a rod or bar extending from opposite sides of a baseball or softball. Opposite sides of the rod or bar are differently coded so that someone using the aid in learning how to throw a ball can immediately tell if they are doing it correctly. The coding can be a color coding (e.g., green on one side, red on the other), or some type of symbol or word(s) (e.g., “correct”, “wrong”) which makes it readily apparent to the user if they are correctly preparing to throw. The bar or rod is integrally formed with the ball; that is, the ball and bar or rod are made as a molded plastic piece. Alternatively, the rod or bar is inserted in a hole or opening drilled through a baseball or softball. Or, there can be two separate rods or bars which are attached to opposite sides of a ball. Also, the two rods or bars are integrally formed with a yoke sized to snuggly fit about the cover of a ball with the yoke being fitted about the ball for practice and then removed for play with the ball. Among the advantages of the baseball throwing aid of the present invention are that it teaches the proper way to position one's thumb on the ball before throwing the ball and how to properly prepare to throw the ball in an easy to visualize and understand way. The baseball throwing aid can be used by anybody wanting to learn how to properly throw a baseball or softball. Importantly, the baseball throwing aid helps prevent arm injuries, particularly among younger players by instilling in them at an early age the proper throwing mechanics. The baseball throwing aid is simple, relatively low cost, and easy to use. It can be carried in a sports equipment bag or a player's gym bag or the like, and can be used during practice before games, or for practicing at home in front of a mirror, or outside in the yard while playing “pitch and catch” with a family member or friend. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS The objects of the invention are achieved as set forth in the illustrative embodiments shown in the drawings which form a part of the specification. FIGS. 1A and 1B are simplified representations of how to correctly prepare to throw a ball (FIG. 1A) and incorrectly do so (FIG. 1B); FIG. 2A is an elevation view of one embodiment of the baseball throwing aid and FIG. 2B is a plan view thereof; and, FIGS. 3A-3C are respective representations of other embodiments of the throwing aid. Corresponding reference characters indicate corresponding parts throughout the several views of the drawings. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION Throughout the drawings, the reference character B refers to a ball. The ball can be either a baseball or a softball without departing from the scope of the invention. A baseball is typically smaller in diameter than a softball and may have a cover made of a different material. Baseballs are usually thrown overhand by a pitcher to a batter, and softballs underhanded. Other players usually throw either ball overhand to each other. The present invention is directed to a training aid indicated general 10 in FIGS. 2A and 2B to aid in teaching the proper mechanics of throwing a baseball or softball B from one player to another. Training aid 10 teaches a player the correct position of the thumb on his or her throwing hand after the player has drawn back their arm to throw the ball, but before the arm moves forward in the throwing motion. This is as shown in FIG. 1A in which player P has his or her arm drawn back preparing to throw the ball. In the correct throwing position shown in FIG. 1A, the player's thumb points behind them. In the incorrect position shown in FIG. 1B, the ball is cupped in the player's hand and their thumb points skyward rather than behind them. Pitching aid 10 is designed to provide a visual indication that tells the thrower that their thumb is pointed in the correct direction. In the embodiment of pitching aid 10 shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, a projection such as a rod or bar 12A, 12B extends outwardly from a ball B on opposite sides of the ball. That is, one projection extends from the side of the ball and a second projection extends from the side of the ball oppositely of the first projection. Each rod is, for example, 4″-6″ long and ¾″-1″ in diameter. As shown in FIG. 2B, the opposite sides of each rod are of a different color. For example, the side of the bars the player would see when he or she has drawn the ball back correctly would be green as indicated G; while, if the ball is drawn back incorrectly the color they would see would be red as indicated R. Such a visual indication makes it readily apparent to the player if they are doing it right or wrong. Importantly, pitching aid 10 is not to be thrown. Rather, it's intended only to provide a visual indication to the player of his or her use of the proper mechanics prior to throwing a ball. Pitching aid 10 is, in one embodiment, of a molded plastic two-piece construction. That is, the aid is molded in two sections which are then glued, sonic welded or otherwise joined together. One section comprises one-half of the ball and rods or bars 12A, 12B and is molded in one color, and the other section comprises the other half of the ball and rods or bars and is molded in a different, contrasting color. As in the above example, the one side of the pitching aid is “green” to indicate the proper placement of the hand and thumb in the drawn-back position before throwing the ball; and the other side is “red” to indicate the wrong drawn-back hand/thumb position before throwing the ball. Also shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B are outlines for positioning a player's fingers and thumbs on the ball so to assist the player in gripping it properly. If the ball of the pitching aid is molded, these positions would comprise indentations formed on the outside of the ball. In another embodiment of the pitching aid 10, ball B and the rods or bars 12A, 12B are of a rubber material. The pitching aid has the rods or bars projecting from opposite sides of the ball. In this embodiment, the ball is white, for example, with the opposite sides of each rod or bar red and green as before. Referring to FIG. 3A, in another embodiment of the pitching aid, indicated 20, ball B has a central bore 21 through which a rod or bar 22 is inserted so that the ends of the bar or rod project from opposite sides of the ball. As before, one side of the bar or rod is green and the opposite side red. Referring to FIG. 3B, in another embodiment of the pitching aid, indicated 30, ball B is a regulation baseball or softball used in games. A yoke 31 has a curvature corresponding to that of the ball. From each end of the yoke, a rod or bar 32 extends. Again, one side of the bar or rod is green and the opposite side red. The yoke and side bars or rods are of a one-piece construction and the yoke is designed to fit snuggly about the cover of ball B. In this embodiment, one practices with a regulation ball by fitting the yoke over the cover of the ball and practicing as previously described. To use the ball for actual play, the yoke is simply removed and set aside. Referring to FIG. 3C, in another embodiment of the pitching aid, indicated 40, ball B is again a regulation baseball or softball used in games. If ball B is a well-used ball such that it no longer is used for actual play, holes 41 are drilled into opposite sides of the ball and rods or bars 42 have a threaded end which is screwed into place. As before, one side of the bar or rod is green and the opposite side red. Those skilled in the art will understand that other means of attachment can also be used to attach the rods or bars to the side of the ball. Each embodiment of the throwing aid includes indicia either formed on the ball or applied to the surface of the ball, using decals or the like, which indicate where the fingers and thumb should be placed for holding the aid. This is as shown in FIG. 4. Use of the throwing aid on a regular basis helps develop the player's correct throwing mechanics. Importantly, the training aid also provides coaches and parents a simple, easy-to-use visual aid to better show a player where to place their fingers and thumb. In use, one learns the correct throwing technique while preventing arm injuries, particularly among younger players. Finally, the throwing aid is relatively low cost. It is easily stored when not in use and can be carried in an equipment bag or player's gym bag for ready accessibility to practice before games, or for practicing at home in front of a mirror, or outside in the yard. In view of the above, it will be seen that the several objects and advantages of the present disclosure have been achieved and other advantageous results have been obtained. 1.
