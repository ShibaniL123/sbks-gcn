Example 1-3 : Preparation of 4,4'-(3-methoxypyridin-2,6-diyl)bis(pyrimidin-2-amine) (VI)
1,1'-(3-Methoxypyridin-2,6-diyl)diethanone (IV) (80 mg, 414.08 µmole) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal (DMFDMA) (831.6 µL, 6.21 mmole) and the resulting solution was stirred with reflux for 24 hrs. The resulting solution was cooled and evaporated and concentrated under reduced pressure to give a yellow solid. The solid was dissolved in methanol (MeOH) (1 mL), and 25 % sodium methoxide (NaOMe) (757.4 µL, 3.31 mmole) and guanidine hydrochloride (118.67 mg, 1.24 mmole) were added dropwise thereto. And then, the resulting reaction mixture was stirred with reflux for 24 hrs and cooled. The resulting solution was diluted with ethylacetate (EA), washed with water, and the organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and evaporated and concentrated under reduced pressure to give the title compound (65 mg, 53%).
