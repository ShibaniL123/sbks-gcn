The current invention relates to the field of nucleic acid amplification, such as nucleic acid amplification to detect the presence of specific nucleic acid sequences in biological samples, such as samples from plants, or plant material or material derived from plants. The methods may be used in a qualitative or quantitative manner, and may also be used to determine whether the concentration of specific nucleic acid sequences in biological samples is below a set threshold level. Provided are methods and compositions for the amplification of nucleic acids, whereby the nucleic acids, including DNA, are extracted from biological material, or material containing such biological material, using extraction with an alkaline solution, preferably with minimal or even without mechanical maceration of the sample, and whereby the alkaline extract is directly added to a reaction mixture or lyophilized mastermix allowing amplification of the nucleic acid of interest without an intervening additional neutralization or dilution step. The methods and compositions may be conveniently used together with a single device allowing sampling, preferably of a plant part, and amplification and/or detection of the nucleic acid(s) of interest without the necessity to open the device after sampling the material potentially containing the nucleic acid(s) of interest and/or after the amplification reaction, thereby minimizing the risk of contamination of the sample by any extrinsic nucleic acid. BACKGROUND ART In modern agriculture, being able to detect a specific nucleotide sequence of a so-called nucleic acid of interest or target sequence, is becoming more and more important. This capability allows e.g. to rapidly detect specific nucleic acid sequences associated with the presence of a particular characteristic or trait in a plant, thereby allowing to develop particular plants with particular combinations of characteristics in a more direct and more efficient manner. Such capability also allows to detect particular variant alleles in plants. With the development of transgenic plants, a need has arisen to be able to detect the presence of biological material comprising particular transgenic events, e.g. in the field, in the variety development of plants, or in the commercial chain (grain production, grain transport, grain storage etc.), preferably at higher speed, lower cost and with greater versatility. Moreover, different transgenic events may comprise similar or even identical nucleic acids, and often it is desirable to be able to distinguish between such different transgenic events, comprising similar or identical nucleic acids, requiring the application of event specific detection methods and tools. Additionally, more and more plant diseases can be rapidly and unambiguously diagnosed via detection of specific nucleotide sequences, associated with the pathogens (fungal, viral, bacterial, nematode or other plant pests) causing the disease. The applicability of detection of specific nucleotide sequence in biological material is of course not limited to agricultural applications, but also extends into other fields, including the medical field, forensics, genetic counseling etc. Various detection methods are based upon amplification of a target nucleic acid and/or DNA having a specific nucleotide sequence, the oldest process being the polymerase chain reaction. Of particular interest are the isothermal DNA amplification methods, including the so-called LAMP or Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification as described in e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 641,027 (Eiken) The method is characterized by the use of 4 different primers specifically designed to recognize 6 distinct regions on the target gene and the reaction process proceeds at a constant temperature using strand displacement reaction. Amplification and detection of target nucleic acid of interest can be completed in a single step, by incubating the mixture of the biological sample or a nucleic acid extract thereof, primers, DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity and substrates at a constant temperature (about 65° C.). It provides high amplification efficiency, with DNA being amplified 109-1010 times in 15-60 minutes. Because of its high specificity, the presence of amplified product can indicate the presence of target gene (http://loopamp.eiken.co.jp/e/lamp/index.html). Other isothermal DNA amplification methods include the so-called Nicking Enzyme Amplification Reaction (NEAR) (Envirologix). NEAR uses a nicking enzyme and strand-displacing polymerase to generate small pieces of DNA that feed a DNA extension reaction; alternating cycles of nicking and extension lead to exponential amplification. The method is described in e.g. US 2009/0017453. Yet another isothermal nucleic acid and/or DNA amplification method is the so-called Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) (TwistDx). The RPA method uses recombinases, which are capable of pairing oligonucleotide primers with homologous sequence in duplex DNA. Through this method, DNA synthesis by a DNA polymerase is directed to defined points in a sample DNA. If the target sequence is present, a DNA amplification reaction is initiated. Recombinase polymerase amplification is described e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 7,270,981. Other isothermal amplification methods are described in Gill and Ghaemi, 2008, Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids, 27(3) 224-243. An important step in all nucleic acid and/or DNA amplification methods is the preparation of the template nucleic acids from the biological material. For automatic processing of the amplification reaction, convenient and efficient nucleic acid extraction from the biological samples, yielding sufficient template nucleic acids, and preferably in a solution without turbidity, is preferred. Preferably, the extraction step should only have minimal maceration, or even avoid mechanical maceration of the biological material as this may introduce turbidity in the solution. Alkaline extraction of template nucleic acid and/or DNA from biological samples may provide such a method using only minimal maceration of the biological sample. Klimyuk (1993) (Plant Journal 3(3) 493-494) described alkali treatment for rapid preparation of plant material for reliable PCR analysis. Chomczynski and Rymaszewski (2006) described and alkaline polyethylene glycol-based method for direct PCR from bacteria, eukaryotic tissue samples, and whole blood. (BioTechniques, 40, 454-457). A drawback of the alkaline extraction methods, is that the resulting extract needs to be neutralized or diluted sufficiently, prior to adding the extract or an aliquot thereof to the amplification reaction mixture. Such a dilution or neutralization step results in additional handling of the sample, increasing the risk of contamination of the sample with unwanted nucleic acids and/or DNA. The additional step further complicates automated processing of the amplification reaction (see also Lee et al., 2009, J. Agric. Food Chem. 2009, 57, 9400-9402). Furthermore, there is a need for automated processing of sampling, amplification and detection with a minimum of process steps. Such kits and/or devices for automated processing could be used in environment outside of a laboratory, particularly if the chemistry and processing is robust. Current detection methods to be used outside of a laboratory environment are protein based detection tools, such as Lateral Flow Strips. Protein based detection tools fail to detect e.g. transgenic plants with silenced genes causing a trait, temporal or special expression of proteins, or cannot distinguish between different plants or transgenic events expressing the same or similar proteins. The current invention provides a solution to these problems as described hereinafter in the summary, detailed embodiments, examples, drawings and claims.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION The current invention is based on the optimization of nucleic acid amplification reaction conditions, allowing direct enzymatic nucleic acid amplification using as template, nucleic acid and/or DNA extracted from biological material by means of an alkaline solution, without any intervening neutralization or dilution step as in the prior art. The direct addition of nucleic acid and/or DNA also avoids the need for temperature based denaturation of the nucleic acid to allow primer binding, and may thus contribute to the efficiency of detecting the nucleic acid of interest. Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, a method is described for amplification of nucleic acids such as DNA, comprising the steps of a. isolating template nucleic acid or DNA from a biological sample using an alkaline extraction solutionb. providing ingredients and conditions to amplify DNA wherein said isolated template DNA in said alkaline extraction solution is not diluted or not neutralized prior to said step b) but rather directly added to those ingredients. The alkaline extraction solution may comprise KOH, NaOH or LiOH, preferably KOH, preferably in a concentration range of about 25 to 100 mM, particularly in a concentration range of about 50 mM. One of the advantages of alkaline extraction of nucleic acid and/or DNA from biological samples is that there is no need to process the biological sample by mechanical maceration, thereby avoiding introduction of turbidity in the extracts or subsequent reaction mixtures. Of course a certain level of maceration may be acceptable or even preferable. E.g. clipping of a leaf sample already introduces a minimal level of maceration to the sample, although no further maceration may be required. Further minimal maceration may include punctuation of the sample or squeezing the sample. Preferably, the extraction solution also comprises carrier DNA, i.e. DNA which does not contain the nucleic acid of interest, and preferably is obtained from an organism unrelated to the sampled biological material. For plant material, a convenient source of carrier DNA is fish sperm DNA, although DNA from any other source may also be used. The presence of the carrier DNA reduces the frequency of false positives in the subsequent amplification and detection of amplified DNA. To allow direct addition of alkaline extract containing the template nucleic acid or template DNA to the reaction mixture, the reaction mixture has a composition having a sufficient buffering capacity, yet without increasing the ionic strength of the reaction mixture too high, so that the amplification enzyme is not inhibited. To allow direct amplification without extra neutralization or dilution step, the invention provides in one embodiment a composition of matter suitable for the amplification of nucleic acid molecules and/or DNA comprising a mixture of divalent cations, deoxynucleotides (dNTPs), an enzyme capable of DNA amplification, and primers suitable to amplify a nucleic acid and/or DNA of interest, characterized in that the mixture has a buffering capacity at a sufficiently low ionic strength to sufficiently neutralize an alkaline solution containing template nucleic acid or DNA in order to allow the amplification enzyme to function. Such composition may e.g. comprise a salt containing ammonium as cation and an anion of a weak acid, and/or a further organic acid, preferably a dicarboylic acid. As used herein, a weak acid is an acid which has a pKa of about 2 to 6. In one embodiment the salt is ammoniumpentaborate (NH4B5O8). In another embodiment, the salt may be a salt of a weak acid and ammonium as cation, whereby upon solution in water the achieved pH is around the optimum pH of the enzyme to be used in the amplification reaction. In a preferred embodiment, the pH after solution of the ammonium salt is around 8.5. The ammoniumpentaborate in the reaction mixture may have a final concentration of between 10 mM and 100 mM, preferably between 30 and 40 mM, particularly about 30 mM. The ammonium cation and borate anion may also be obtained from other sources. E.g. the ammonium cation can be obtained from ammoniumsulfate and the borate anion from Tris-borate. However, care has to be taken to keep the total ionic strength of the buffer low enough to avoid inhibition of the polymerase enzyme. The additional organic acid may be selected from oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, glucuronic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid or a mixture thereof, preferably in a final concentration of between 10 and 40 mM, preferably about 40 mM. It is important that the organic acid is not inhibitory to the amplification reaction or the amplification. It has e.g. been found that citric acid or ascorbic acid can be inhibitory for a LAMP reaction. Another important constituent of the reaction mix for amplification of nucleic acids and/or DNA are the oligonucleotide primers. The term “primer” as used herein encompasses any nucleic acid, preferably a DNA, that is capable of priming the synthesis of a nascent nucleic acid in a template-dependent process, such as PCR, NEAR, RPA, LAMP. Typically, primers are oligonucleotides from 10 to 30 nucleotides, but longer sequences can be employed. Primers suitable for LAMP may be up to 60 nucleotides. Primers may be provided in double-stranded form, though the single-stranded form is preferred. The primers recognize specifically the target nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid of interest, and specifically hybridize to that nucleic acid, thereby determining the specificity of the assay with regard to the nucleic acid of interest to be amplified/detected. Primers may contain further chemical modifications allowing detection of the amplified nucleic acid or DNA as described herein after. The exact arrangement and structure of the primers is also arranged by the amplification method to be used. For LAMP e.g. 4 types of primers are designed, based on 6 distinct regions of the target gene: the F3c, F2c and F1c regions at the 3′ side and the B1, B2 and B3 regions at the 5′ side: FIP: Forward Inner Primer (FIP) consists of the F2 region (at the 3′ end) that is complementary to the F2c region, and the same sequence as the F1c region at the 5′ end.F3 Primer: Forward Outer Primer consists of the F3 region that is complementary to the F3c region.BIP: Backward Inner Primer (BIP) consists of the B2 region (at the 3′ end) that is complementary to the B2c region, and the same sequence as the B1c region at the 5′ end.B3 Primer: Backward Outer Primer consists of the B3 region that is complementary to the B3c region. The reaction may further be optimized by inclusion of so-called Loop Primers (either Loop Primer B or Loop Primer F), containing sequences complementary to the single stranded loop region (either between the B1 and B2 regions, or between the F1 and F2 regions) on the 5′ end of the dumbbell-like structure, provide an increased number of starting points for DNA synthesis for the LAMP method (see also loopamp.eiken.co.jp/e/lamp). Yet another important constituent of the reaction mix for amplification of nucleic acids and/or DNA are the enzymes for amplification. Depending on the method used these enzymes include DNA I polymerase, Klenow polymerase, TaqI polymerase, a DNA polymerase with strand displacing properties, phi 29 polymerase, Bst polymerase (NEB), Csa polymerase, 96-7 polymerase (http://www.nippongene.com), Bsm polymerase (Fermentas), GspSSD polymerase (Optigene) and others. In one embodiment of the methods of the invention, the composition is suitable for use in connection with the so-called LAMP method as herein described. However the compositions and methods may also be used in other types of amplification including RPA, PCR, NEAR etc. Other constituents in the reaction mixture are considered less critical and comprise dNTPS in a final concentration of between 0.2 mM to 1.4 mM; and divalent cations (Mg2+, Mn2+, . . . ) in a final concentration of between 1-10 mM. Mg2SO4 is a suitable salt, but may be replaced with other salts. Detection of the amplified nucleic acid of interest, preferably DNA of interest, can be performed in any way known in the art. The detection may be specific or aspecific or a mixture of both. The detection could be based on a colorimetric, turbidimetric, luminescent or fluorescent assay. Fluorescent detection is considered to be very convenient. In general, fluorescent nucleic acid detection is achieved using fluorescent nucleic acid dyes which can be classified in two major classes: intercalators and minor groove binders, although there are other dyes that may bind to nucleic acids via multiple modes, including electrostatic interaction between a positively charged dye and the negatively charged nucleic acid. Fluorescent intercalators are dyes that bind to double stranded DNA or double stranded RNA by inserting themselves in between a neighbouring base pair. Minor groove-binders are dyes that bind to the minor groove of double stranded DNA. Intercalator dyes include ethidium bromide (well known in the art, but less preferred due to its mutagenic or carcinogenic properties) or asymmetric cyanine dyes such as SYBR Green I, SYBR Gold or SYBR safe. SYBR Green is N′,N′-dimethyl-N-[4-[(E)-(3-methyl-1,3-benzothiazol-2-ylidene)methyl]-1-phenylquinolin-1-ium-2-yl]-N-propylpropane-1,3-diamine). SYBR Safe has been described in US patent application publication No. 2005/0239096 (herein incorporated by reference). US patent application publication No 2006/0211029 (hereby incorporated by reference) describes several dimeric fluorescent dyes including EVA Green. Dimeric fluorescent dyes comprise two monomeric dyes and a suitable linker to form a dimeric dye, whereby in the absence of nucleic acids, the dimeric dye assumes a hairpin-like conformation which has a low or no background level fluorescence. In the presence of nucleic acids, the dye assumes an open random conformation, which allows the dye to interact with the nucleic acid and increase the fluorescence. Another fluorescent dye which could be useful is SYTO-81 (Invitrogen). Tanner et al. (2012, Biotechniques 53, 2) describe fluorescent probes for LAMP reaction which when used with similar primers on pure DNA results in detection of amplification which appears to be slightly later but with a significantly better signal/noise ration than when using e.g. SYBR Green. Detection of the amplified nucleic acid of interest may also occur via antibody specific recognition. To this end, the amplified nucleic acid of interest may include modifications incorporating specific antigens recognized by a specific antibody, which may be introduced e.g. by modification of the oligonucleotide primers used for the nucleic acid amplification. Detection could also be achieved by affinity based assays (using e.g. streptavidin-biotin) or hybridization based assays. Use of this type of assays is well known in the art (e.g. Lateral Flow Strips). As used herein, a biological sample is used to indicate any biological material, particularly biological material comprising nucleic acids, or material containing or derived from such biological material, provided that nucleic acids can still be detected. A non-limiting list of biological material includes leaf segments, stem segments, root segments, seed, seed powder, meal, fibers, single seeds, seed chips, seed bulks etc. Biological material may comprise or be obtained from fungi, bacteria, including rhizobacteria, viruses, plants, animals, Protista and the like. The compositions for the amplification of a nucleic acid of interest as herein described may further comprise detergents such as Triton X-100, Tween 20, Pluronic-F-68(Invitrogen), or combinations thereof preferably in a concentration of about 0.1%. Conveniently, the compositions for the amplification of a nucleic acid of interest as herein described are provided in a lyophilized form. To this end, the compositions are supplemented with lyophilization protection agents, such as trehalose, preferably in a final concentration of 0.001% to about 5%. Preferably, the components are lyophilized on a solid or semi-solid support or scaffold (“pad”), allowing for easy handling. The compositions of matter and methods for the amplification of a nucleic acid of interest, may be used in a device or cartridge allowing sampling of biological material, nucleic acid or DNA extraction and amplification and detection without a further need for opening the device after the sampling or amplification has taken place. Nevertheless, it may be advantageous in certain embodiments to be able to open the device or cartridge during the processing, particularly after the amplification reaction has taken place, e.g. to allow a particular form of detection. Such a device may comprise a. a means for sampling of the biological material;b. a liquid reservoir comprising an alkaline extraction solution;c. a reaction mixture, i.e. composition of matter as herein described;d. appropriate channels to direct the alkaline extraction solution, upon activation, over the biological sample to the reaction mixture;e. optionally a means to detect amplification of nucleic acids. One embodiment of such device is schematically represented in FIGS. 1a to c. The device may comprise: An cover (1) and base (2) component fitting together to be closed, preferably by aligning one structure onto the other, preferably around the hinge section (3).The base and upper component containing fitting and corresponding chamber parts (4) and (5) which when the base and upper component are aligned, e.g. are folded together, form a chamber A, fit to receive the biological sample, whereby optionally the protruding parts or clips of the sample chamber parts (6) and (7) can be used to separate the biological sample, such as a leaf part, from surrounding biological material. Preferably, the chamber A is water-tight.The chamber A may further comprise a fluid transporting channel (8), such as a channel in the form of spiral, optionally having several openings allowing optimal distribution of the extraction buffer over the biological sample.Attached to one of the components is a liquid reservoir (9) containing an alkaline extraction solution. The liquid reservoir may be a burst buffer chamber, such as a blister described in WO2010/094249; WO2011/006460 or WO2009/071078. The liquid reservoir is connected through the chamber A via a channel (10).The upper or base component, preferably the base component, further contain at least one, preferably two chambers B (11) (12) connected to at least one part of chamber A, preferably the lower chamber A part (4) by a channel (13), said chambers allowing to receive a composition of matter as herein described for the amplification of nucleic acids of interest. Preferably, when two chambers B are present, one of the chambers is used to receive a composition of matter suitable for the detection of a nucleic acid of interest, whereas the other chamber is used to receive a composition of matter suitable for the detection of a nucleic acid of interest known to be present in the biological sample (such as an endogenous gene of the sampled plant), thereby acting as positive control for the functioning of the amplification reaction. The composition of matter suitable for the detection of a nucleic acid of interest may be provided in the form of a lyophilized composition of matter, preferably in the form of a pad comprising the lyophilized composition of matter. This also provides for interchangeability of the amplification reactions which can be performed using different pads comprising different compositions of matter as herein described, thereby increasing the versatility of the device. When two chambers B are present, the channel connecting the sample chamber to the reconstitution chambers needs to allow the distribution of the extraction buffer containing the extracted template DNA over the two reconstitution chambers, preferably in equal portions. This can be achieved using a channel with a T-form junction (14).The base and cover component, preferably the base component, further contain at least one, preferably two chambers C (15) (16), connected to the at least one chamber B by a channel (17) (18). When two chambers C are present, each chamber C is preferably connected by a channel to one chamber B only.The base and cover component, preferably the base component, further optionally contain at least one, preferably two chambers D (19)(20) connected to the at least one chamber C by a channel (21) (22). When two chambers D are present, each chamber C is preferably connected by a channel to one chamber C only.The base and cover component preferably contains a means allowing physical access (such as a hole) (23) to allow interaction with the liquid reservoir (9).The base and cover component further optionally contains an at least one, preferably two optically transparent region over the region of said chamber B or said chamber(s) C allowing (optionally fluorescent or colorimetric) detection (24) (25).The channels may further contain one or more valve systems, such as e.g. the valve systems described in WO2012/048685 to direct the flow of the liquid in the channels in one direction.Optionally, the base and cover components may contain means for locking the upper and lower support together, such as holes (26) and protrusions (27) in the cover. As used herein “a pad” is a thin inert support material, such as siliconized rock wool, or polymer fleece or fiber, comprising the composition of matter for amplification of nucleic acids as herein described. The composition of matter may be contained in two inert supports, or may applied to one inert support only. Preferably, the composition of matter has been lyophilized. The inert support should allow the buffer fluid to pass. Preferably, the inert support tightly fits into a cartridge chamber, thereby additionally functioning as a sieve for retention of particles interfering with the reaction and/or detection. The cartridge may be filled with biological material. This can be achieved by clipping the first and second, or upper (1) and lower (2) supports or covers together, thereby fitting the first and second or lower (4) and upper (5) chamber parts together in such a way that the biological material is entrapped in the closed chamber A, which may thus serve as a sample chamber. E.g the cover may be slipped over a plant leaf, so that upon closing the sample chamber edges clip out a piece of leaf, enclosed in the chamber A. Alternatively, seed or seed powder or other material containing or derived from biological material potentially comprising the nucleic acids of interest may be deposited in the lower sample chamber half, and the upper cover can be folded and closed over the biological material. Subsequently, the alkaline extraction solution contained in the liquid reservoir (9) is directed through the channel connecting the liquid reservoir and the chamber A (10). This may be achieved by applying pressure to the liquid reservoir (9). The alkaline solution passes over the biological material in the chamber A (4) (5), optionally through the distribution device (8) thereby extracting nucleic acids, such as DNA, present in the biological sample. The extraction fluid containing nucleic acids from the biological sample is guided through the channel (13) connecting the chamber A and the chamber(s) B (15) (16). Equal distribution of the extraction fluid over the chambers B may be ensured by a T-form junction (14) in the channel. In the chamber(s) B, the alkaline extraction solution containing the extracted nucleic acids and/or DNA passes over and through the pads containing a composition of matter for amplification of nucleic acids according to the invention. In this step of the reaction, the extraction fluid may be filtered going through the pads, and is mixed with the composition of matter for amplification of nucleic acids, reconstituting a reaction mixture, which is guided towards the chamber(s) C (21) (22) through the channels connecting chamber(s) B and chamber(s) C (17) (18). The cartridge is then subjected to a temperature regime required for the amplification of nucleic acids suitable for the reaction mix used. When isothermal amplification is used, the cartridge may be heated for a period of time to a constant temperature, such as e.g. 65° C. Usually, the reaction will be allowed to progress for a period of time of about 5 to 60 minutes, or 20 to 30 minutes. The heating may also be applied additionally during the nucleic acid extraction step, prior to the amplification step. Amplification of the nucleic acid of interest (or of the control nucleic acid) may be monitored through the region allowing optical monitoring of the chamber(s) C (24) (25). This monitoring or detection may either be performed continuously as the amplification reaction progresses (real-time) or may be performed only at the end of the reaction (end-point detection). The detection may also occur via an affinity or antibody based detection unit or hybridization based assay, which may be built-in, or plugged in after the amplification reaction has taken place. The chamber(s) D (19) (20) may function as a waste chamber and allow to capture any expansion of the fluid during heating. Return flow of liquid through the channels may be prevented by providing passive valves in the channels. In one embodiment of the invention, the base and/or cover component may be cast as a single piece, whereby the channels are cast into the molded component. In an alternative embodiment the base and cover component may be produced by milling the channels into the material of the base and upper component, whereby the base and upper component are covered by transparent cover foil. In a preferred embodiment the cartridge is molded from chemically inert material, preferably with low binding affinity for nucleic acid. The cartridge may be molded from polypropylene. The optimization of the composition of matter for amplifying nucleic acids to allow amplification without a preceding neutralization step after extraction of nucleic acids or DNA from biological material by an alkaline solution, allowed to design a cartridge comprising only one buffer contained in one liquid reservoir. The design of the cartridge with only one liquid reservoir provides the additional advantage that cartridges may be produced which are simpler to use and cheaper to produce. The cartridge may be put into a device allowing actuation by pressure, preferably controlled actuation by controlled pressure of the liquid reservoir. The device may also allow heating of the cartridge up to the required temperature. Furthermore the device may allow real-time or end-point monitoring of the detection of the amplified nucleic acids of interest. In one embodiment of the invention, the device accepting the cartridge may be hand-held, and powered by batteries, to allow processing of the samples and amplification reaction in the cartridge at the point of interest. The point of interest may be a field, a grain elevator, a ginning factory etc. It will be clear that the methods, compositions of matter, kits or devices can be applied to detect nucleic acid sequences of interest, in any biological matter, including biological material derived from any plant, including corn, tobacco, cereal plants including wheat, oat, barley, rye, rice, turfgrass, sorghum, millet or sugarcane plants. The methods of the invention can also be applied to any plant including but not limited to cotton, canola, oilseed rape, soybean, vegetables, potatoes, Lemna spp., Nicotiana spp., Arabidopsis, alfalfa, barley, bean, corn, cotton, flax, pea, rape, rice, rye, safflower, sorghum, soybean, sunflower, tobacco, wheat, asparagus, beet, broccoli, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, celery, cucumber, eggplant, lettuce, onion, oilseed rape, pepper, potato, pumpkin, radish, spinach, squash, tomato, zucchini, almond, apple, apricot, banana, blackberry, blueberry, cacao, cherry, coconut, cranberry, date, grape, grapefruit, guava, kiwi, lemon, lime, mango, melon, nectarine, orange, papaya, passion fruit, peach, peanut, pear, pineapple, pistachio, plum, raspberry, strawberry, tangerine, walnut and watermelon. Depending on the biological sample and/or its origin, further optimization of the various parameters of the reaction mixtures described herein may performed, and is well within the reach of the skilled artisan. It will further be clear that the methods, compositions of matter, kits or devices can also be applied to detect nucleic acid sequences of interest from animals, in biological materials, including from a human, mammal, fish, cattle, goat, pig, sheep, cow, horse, rodent, hamster, mouse, rat, guinea pig, rabbit, primate, nematode, shellfish, prawn, crab, lobster, insect, fruit fly, Coleapteran insect, Dipteran insect, Lepidopteran insect or Homeopteran insect. The methods, compositions of matter, kits or devices may also be used to detect nucleic acids from lower organisms, including pathogens, such as phytopathogenic fungi or phytopathogenic bacteria or phytopathogenic viruses or animal pathogens, but also e.g. from plant growth promoting bacteria. It will also be clear that the methods, compositions of matter, kits or devices can be applied to detect any nucleic acid of interest, including transgenes, mutant or variant alleles, marker sequences associated with the presence of a particular trait, such as QTL markers, endogenous sequences, exogenous sequences, viral nucleic acids, pathogen nucleic acids including bacterial or fungal pathogens. The nucleic acids detected as herein described may be DNA or RNA. To detect RNA, the methods and means described herein may further comprise a reverse transcriptase. The methods and means described herein may also be adapted such that DNA amplification occurs using RNA as template. Preferably, the amplification reaction is accompanied by a control reaction, i.e. a nucleic acid amplification reaction amplifying a sequence which is known to be present in the nucleic acid extract derived from the biological sample, such as a endogenous sequence. When using a kit or cartridge according to the invention comprising more than one reconstitution and reaction chamber, it is advisable to reserve one reconstitution chamber and one reaction chamber for the control reaction.

EXAMPLES Example 1 Conditions for DNA Extraction For nucleic acid or DNA extracts from biological samples, a solution of 50 mM KOH and 1 ng/μl fish sperm DNA (Roche) was used. By using 50 mM KOH (0.28%) as extraction solution we can omit the presence of KCl in the reaction buffer and therefore keep the overall ionic strength low. The DNA concentration in crude extracts is very low. To prevent unspecific binding of the DNA to the tubes we use carrier DNA. In addition the carrier DNA prevents amplification of unspecific products in NTCs (no template controls). A leaf disc from cotton, soybean or canola was taken by closing an Eppendorf reaction tube over a leaf 0.5 ml of the above extraction buffer is added. The leaf is incubated 8 min at 65° C. without any mechanical treatment or punched 10 times with the tip of a 0.5 ml pipette and incubated 5 min at room temperature. 20 μl of the crude DNA extract is added directly to the lyophilized mastermix for LAMP reaction (see Example 2) and the samples are incubated in a real time PCR machine at 65° C. To 100 mg of seed powder from cotton, soybean or Canola 40 ml of extraction solution was added in a 50 ml reaction tube. The seed powder was suspended and the sample incubated 5 min at room temperature. An aliquot of 20 μl of the supernatant was used for the reactions. Example 2 LAMP Reaction Conditions LAMP primers were designed using the LAMP Designer software (Premier Biosoft International) and suitable primers were synthesized. A mastermix is prepared containing the following components: a. 30 mM Ammoniumpentaborate (Sigma)b. 40 mM malic acid (Sigma)c. 0.8 M Betaine (5 M solution for PCR from Sigma)d. 5% Trehalose (Sigma)e. 8 mM Mg2SO4 (Sigma)f. 0.8 mM dNTPs (Promega)g. 0.2 μM F3 primerh. 0.2 μM B3 primeri. 1.5 μM FIP primerj. 1.5 μM BIP primerk. 0.75 μM LoopF primerl. 0.75 μM LoopB primerm. 0.4 U/μl Polymerase GspSSD (Optigene)n. 0.0004 U/μl Pyrophosphatase ApePPiase (Optigene)o. 0.8× fluorescent dye EvaGreeen® from a 20× commercially available stock solution Aliquots of 20 μl were deposited in small reaction tubes or 96 well plates and lyophilized two hours at 0.77 mbar in a Christ Delta 1-24 LSC lyophilizer. 20 μl of DNA in extraction solution (see Example 1) was directly added to one well with lyophilized mastermix and the samples were incubated in a real time PCR machine at 65° C. Example 3 Comparison of Prior Art Buffers and Buffers According to the Invention for LAMP Reactions 100 mg of soybean seed powder (containing a transgenic 2mEPSPS gene) was extracted with 40 ml extraction solution (50 mM KOH, 1 ng/μl fish sperm DNA) for 5 min at room temperature. 20 μl of the extract was added to the lyophilized mastermixes with the following compositions: Buffer A: a. 100 mM Ammoniumpentaborateb. 10 mM malic acidc. 1% Trehalosed. 0.8 M betainee. 6 mM Mg2SO4 f. 0.4 mM dNTPsg. 0.8× EvaGreen®h. 1× primermixi. 0.4 U GspSSD/μl Buffer B: a. 30 mM Ammoniumpentaborateb. 40 mM malic acidc. 5% Trehalosed. 0.8 M betainee. 6 mM Mg2SO4 f. 0.4 mM dNTPsg. 0.8× EvaGreen®h. 1× primermixi. 0.4 U GspSSD/μl Buffer C: a. Optigene® 10× bufferb. 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.1c. 30 mM KCld. 30 mM (NH4)2SO4e. 0.1% Triton X-100f. 5% Trehaloseg. 0.8 M betaineh. 6 mM Mg2SO4 i. 0.4 mM dNTPsj. 0.8× EvaGreen®k. 1× primermixl. 0.4 U GspSSD/μl The samples were incubated in a real time PCR machine at 65° C. The results are represented in FIG. 3. Panel 1: detection of the catalase amplicon. Panel 2: detection of the 2mepsps amplicon. Amplification of transgenic 2mEPSPS works best with the Ammoniumpentaborate buffer B. Results may further depend on the plant species. For oilseed rape samples, buffer A with higher ammoniumpentaborate concentrations may be better. However, buffer B appears a suitable buffer over different biological samples. Example 4 Detection of Catalase in Cotton Leaves Using Cartridge In milled cartridge prototypes, leaves from soy or cotton were sampled by a punching mechanism, which in the same turn closed and sealed the cartridge. The DNA extraction solution, present in a coated aluminium blister, was forced over the leaf punch by machine-controlled squeezing of the blister. This crude DNA-containing extract was guided through a filter pad, containing the lyophilized LAMP reagents. The extract reconstituted the biochemicals and reached the reaction chamber. The reaction mixture was heated to 65° C., starting the LAMP-based DNA amplification. A fluorescent intercalating dye present in the mixture was excited by blue light and the resulting fluorescence detected and quantified by an external instrument. Plant leaf samples are being extracted with 50 mM KOH, 1 ng/μl fish sperm carrier DNA (Roche). Prototype cartridges were milled from POM polymer blocks. The extraction fluid was filled into single-use aluminium blisters coated with polypropylene. The reaction buffer was lyophilized onto polypropylene pads. The cartridge was actuated using a lab setup consisting of a linear motor for blister pressing, a heating unit (65° C.), a LED (468 nm) for fluorescent excitation and a camera for imaging purposes. LAMP reactions for catalase from cotton were performed using the following primers: 0.2 μM F3 (GATAAGTTGCTCCAGACTCG; SEQ ID No 1), 0.2 μM B3 (GCATGACGAACAGGATCGTACC; SEQ ID No 2), 15 μM FIP (ATTGGCTGGGAGTTGCAGATAGTTATTCTCCTACTCTGATACCCA; SEQ ID No 3), 15 μM BIP (GCTCCC AAGTGTGCTCATCAATCTCCTCATCCCTGTGC; SEQ ID No 4), 8 μM LoopF (AGTTTGGCCCAAGTCTGT GCCT; SEQ ID No 5), 8 μM LoopR (CAATCACCACGAAGG TTTTATG; SEQ ID No 6). Reaction buffer consisted of 30 mM Ammoniumpentaborate, 40 mM malic acid, 0.8M betaine, 5% trehalose, 8 mM Mg2SO4, 0.8 mM dNTPs, 0.8× Evagreen4 (Biotium, Hayward, USA), 0.4 U/μl GspSSD (Optigene, UK) and pyrophosphatase, 0.0004 U/μl. The results of the amplification in the presence and absence of the DNA of interest are represented in FIG. 4C. Example 5 Alternative Detection by Lateral Flow Strip Detection after LAMP Reaction LAMP was performed with Biotin and FAM labelled loop primers on biological samples of cotton comprising transgenic event GHB614 (comprising a 2mEPSPS coding region) and wildtype cotton as a negative control and detected on HybriDetect strips from Milenia Biotec. The results are represented in FIG. 4. Example 6 Optimization of LAMP Reaction Conditions after Alkaline DNA Extraction The influence of different concentrations of constituents of the reaction mixture for nucleic acid amplification by LAMP were tested. DNA extracts obtained in accordance with Example 1 were tested under various concentrations of organic acid, detergent or ammoniumpentaborate. A set of three samples in four replicates was tested for each certain reaction condition. Amplification with crude DNA extractions show a higher variation compared to amplifications on purified DNA which may be due to the presence of some particles in the solution. In one experiment the influence of the type of additional organic acid on the LAMP reaction was tested. DNA was extracted from cotton leaf and the target nucleic acid was catalase. The results (FIG. 5A) indicate that malic acid results in quicker amplification than maleic acid. In another experiment the influence of the type of additional organic acid on the LAMP reaction was tested. DNA was extracted from cotton leaf and the target nucleic acid was catalase. The results (FIG. 5D) indicate that maleic acid results in quicker amplication than in the absence of maleic acid, while citric acid appear to have an inhibitory effect. In a further experiment the influence of the concentration of ammoniumpentaborate and of malic acid on the LAMP reaction was tested. DNA was extracted from cotton leaf or cotton seed and the target nucleic acid was 2mEPSPS. The results (FIG. 5B) indicate that optimal conditions, for cotton leaf extracts appear to be A or F as set forth in the below table. Ammoniumpenta- Malic acid borate (mM) (mM) A 40 40 B 55 40 C 70 40 D 96 40 E 96 30 F 96 20 G 96 10 H 96 0 In yet a further experiment the influence of the concentration and type of detergent was investigated. DNA was extracted from cotton leaf and the target nucleic acid was catalase. The results (FIG. 4C) indicate that there is little difference between detergents, nor that the concentration played a critical role. The inclusion of detergents appears to have a positive influence on the incidence of positive no template controls.
