Botanical/commercial classification: Coreopsis verticillata/Thread-leaf Coreopsis. Varietal denomination: cv. Novacorbir. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Plants of Coreopsis verticillata sometimes bear common names such as thread-leaf coreopsis, whorled coreopsis, thread-leaved tickseed, and pot-of-gold. The new Coreopsis plant of the present invention originated in a plant nursery tended by man at West Grove, Pa., U.S.A. as an open-pollinated seedling of the ‘Zagreb’ variety (non-patented in the United States). The exact male parent is unknown. The species likely is verticillata. I was attracted to a single plant of the new cultivar in view of its distinctive combination of characteristics. Had the new plant not been discovered and preserved, it would have been lost to mankind. It was found that the new Coreopsis plant displays the following combination of characteristics: (a) displays a dense low compact highly uniform rounded growth habit,(b) displays a freely basal branching habit,(c) displays attractive green foliage,(d) displays a propensity to freely flower for an extended period of time commonly from June to September, and(e) forms attractive large yellow daisy-type inflorescences. The neat, evenly rounded growth habit that is displayed is particularly noteworthy. The expressed combination of characteristics enables the new cultivar to be readily distinguished from its ‘Zagreb’ parent as well as all other previously available Coreopsis plants know to the discoverer. More specifically, the ‘Zagreb’ cultivar displays a larger, less compact growth habit. The ‘Tweety’ cultivar (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 23,347) forms lighter yellow blooms that are smaller in size. The ‘Moonray’ cultivar (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 21,931) forms light creamy ray florets and blooms that are smaller in size. The ‘Moonbeam’ cultivar (non-patented in the United States) forms lighter creamy-yellow blooms. The ‘Star Cluster’ cultivar (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 23,035) forms blooms possessing a dissimilar small purple eye. The ‘Novcorcar’ cultivar (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 22,565) displays blooms that are more orange in coloration combined with a dissimilar more upright growth habit. The new cultivar can be grown to provide attractive ornamentation in parks, gardens, and residential settings. Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar in a controlled environment by the rooting of stem cuttings has been conducted at West Grove, Pa., U.S.A. It has been demonstrated that the combination of characteristics of the new cultivar is firmly fixed and is well retained in succeeding generations. Accordingly, the new cultivar can be asexually reproduced in a true-to-type manner. The new cultivar has been named ‘Novacorbir’ and will be marketed under the LITTLE BIRD trademark. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPH The accompanying photograph illustrates a typical flowering plant of the new cultivar at an age of approximately three years. The plant had been asexually reproduced by the use of stem cuttings and was growing in the ground in full sun at West Grove, Pa., U.S.A. The attractive yellow blossoms combined with the dense low compact highly uniform rounded growth habit are shown. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION The chart used in the identification of the colors described herein is The R.H.S. Colour Chart of The Royal Horticultural Society, London, England (1995 Edition or equivalent). In some instances, more common color terms are provided and are to be accorded their usual dictionary significance. The plants had been asexually reproduced by the rooting of stem cuttings, were approximately three years of age, and were observed while growing outdoors in the ground in full sun during October at West Grove, Pa., U.S.A.
