Synthesis Example 16: Synthesis of [Compound 321]
Synthesis Example 16-1: Synthesis of [Intermediate 16-a]
In a round-bottom flask was placed 1-fluoro-9,9'-dimethylfluorene (50 g, 235 mmol) to which tetrahydrofuran (500 ml) was then added under a nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture was cooled to −78° C. and slowly added with drops of 1.6 M butyl lithium (161 ml, 259 mmol). The temperature was elevated to room temperature before stirring for 4 hours. Then, the temperature was lowered again to −78° C., and trimethylborate (32 ml, 282 mmol) was slowly added while the low temperature was maintained. Following temperature elevation to room temperature, the reaction mixture was stirred. After completion of the reaction, the organic layer was concentrated in a vacuum and recrystallized in hexane to afford Intermediate 16-a (45 g): yield 75%.
