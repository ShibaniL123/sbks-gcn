This application is a Continuation Bypass Application of International Patent Application No. PCT/KR2012/010072, filed Nov. 26, 2012, which claims priority to and the beneifit of Korean Patent Application Nos. 10-2011-0124661 filed on Nov. 25, 2011 and 10-2012-0134551, filed on Nov. 26, 2012, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. FIELD The present application relates to a curable composition and its use. BACKGROUND A light emitting diode (LED), particularly a blue or ultraviolet (UV) LED having an emission wavelength of approximately 250 to 550 nm, is a high-brightness product using a GaN-based compound semiconductor such as GaN, GaAlN, InGaN or InAlGaN. In addition, it is possible to form a high-quality full-color image by a method of combining red and green LEDs with a blue LED. For example, a technique of manufacturing a white LED in combination of a blue or UV LED with a phosphor has been known. Such LEDs are being widely used as backlights for liquid crystal displays (LCDs) or general lighting. As an LED encapsulant, an epoxy resin having a high adhesive property and excellent mechanical durability is being widely used. However, the epoxy resin has a lower light transmittance of a blue light or UV ray region, and low light resistance. Accordingly, for example, the patent documents 1 to 3 disclose techniques for solving the above-described problems. However, encapsulants disclosed in the above references do not have sufficient thermal resistance and light resistance. As a material having excellent light and thermal resistances with respect to a low wavelength region, a silicon resin has been known. However, the silicon resin has stickiness on a cured surface. In addition, to effectively apply the silicon resin as an encapsulant for an LED, characteristics such as high refractivity, crack resistance, surface hardness, adhesive strength and thermal and shock resistance need to be ensured.

The unit of Formula 3 or 4 is a unit in which a silicon atom of D unit and a silicon atom of T unit in a siloxane unit forming the organopolysiloxane are directly bound to each other via an oxygen atom. In one embodiment, as described above, even when the organopolysiloxane is a mixture of at least two components and an average of compositions of respective components is represented as the average composition formula of Formula 1 or 2, the organopolysiloxane may include at least one of a single component having the unit of Formula 3 or 4. The organopolysiloxane including the unit of Formula 3 or 4 will be prepared, for example, by a reaction of a cyclic siloxane compound with an organopolysiloxane having a cage or partial cage structure or a T unit, as will be described below. Particularly, when the above method is applied, an organopolysiloxane including the unit of Formula 3 or 4, and the minimized number of silicon atoms bound with alkoxy and hydroxyl groups in its structure is possibly prepared. In one embodiment, the organopolysiloxane having the average composition formula of Formula 1 or 2 may have a ratio (OR/Ak) of an area (OR) of a peak derived from an alkoxy group binding to a silicon atom to an area (Ak) derived from an alkenyl group binding to a silicon atom in the spectrum measured by 1H NMR of 0.05, 0.03, 0.01, 0.005 or 0 from the spectrum obtained by 1H NMR measurement.

When the mixture including the compound of Formula 5 and the organopolysiloxane having the average composition formula (s) of Formula 6 and/or 7 is reacted, the organopolysiloxane having a desired structure, for example, having the above-described partially-crosslinked structure, may be synthesized at a sufficient molecular weight. When the mixture is reacted as described above, a desired product having minimum functional groups such as an alkoxy or hydroxyl group binding to a silicon atom in the synthesized organopolysiloxane and thus exhibiting excellent physical properties may be prepared. In one embodiment, the mixture may further include a compound represented by Formula 8. [in-line-formulae](RaRb2Si)2O [Formula 8][/in-line-formulae] In Formula 8, Ra is a monovalent hydrocarbon group having 2 or more carbon atoms, and Rb is an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms. In Formula 8, specific kinds of Ra and Rb and a mixing ratio of the mixture may be determined according to a structure of a desired organopolysiloxane.

As a catalyst capable of being included in the mixture, for example, a base catalyst may be used. A suitable base catalyst may be, but is not limited to, a metal hydroxide such as KOH, NaOH or CsOH; a metal silanolate including an alkali metal compound and a siloxane, or a quaternary ammonium compound such as tetramethylammonium hydroxide, tetraethylammonium hydroxide or tetrapropylammonium hydroxide. A ratio of the catalyst in the mixture may be suitably selected in consideration of desired reactivity, and for example, may be 0.01 to 30 parts by weight or 0.03 to 5 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of a total weight of the reaction products in the mixture. In the specification, unless specifically defined otherwise, a unit “parts by weight” refers to a weight ratio between components. In one embodiment, the reaction may be performed in the presence of a suitable solvent. As a solvent, the reaction product in the mixture, that is, disiloxane or organopolysiloxane, may be suitably mixed with a catalyst, and any kind of solvent may be used without obstruction to reactivity. The solvent may be, but is not limited to, an aliphatic hydrocarbon-based solvent such as n-pentane, i-pentane, n-hexane, i-hexane, 2,2,4-trimethyl pentane, cyclohexane or methylcyclohexane; an aromatic solvent such as benzene, toluene, xylene, trimethyl benzene, ethyl benzene or methylethyl benzene; a ketone-based solvent such as methylethylketone, methylisobutylketone, diethylketone, methyl n-propyl ketone, methyl n-butyl ketone, cyclohexanone, methylcyclohexanone or acetylacetone; an ether-based solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, 2-methyl tetrahydrofuran, ethyl ether, n-propyl ether, isopropyl ether, diglyme, dioxine, dimethyldioxine, ethyleneglycol mono methyl ether, ethyleneglycol dimethyl ether, ethyleneglycol diethyl ether, propyleneglycol monomethyl ether or propyleneglycol dimethyl ether; an ester-based solvent such as diethyl carbonate, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, ethyl lactate, ethyleneglycol mono methyl ether acetate, propyleneglycol mono methyl ether acetate or ethyleneglycol diacetate; or an amide-based solvent such as N-methyl pyrollidone, formamide, N-methyl formamide, N-ethyl formamide, N,N-dimethyl acetamide or N,N-diethylacetamide. The reaction may be performed by adding the catalyst to the reaction product. Here, a reaction temperature may be controlled within a range of, for example, 0 to 150° C. or 30 to 130° C. In addition, a reaction time may be controlled within a range of, for example, 1 hour to 3 days. The (B) organopolysiloxane included in the curable composition includes at least one alkenyl group and at least one epoxy group. In addition, (B) organopolysiloxane does not include an aryl group. The curable composition including (B) organopolysiloxane or a cured product thereof may have an enhanced adhesive property. Particularly, since (B) organopolysiloxane does not include an aryl group, for example, a compatibility with another organopolysiloxane component such as (A) or (C) organopolysiloxane to be described below may be degraded, (B) organopolysiloxane may be easily diffused onto a surface from the cured product, and thus may exhibit excellent effects at a small amount. The term “epoxy group” used herein may refer to, unless specifically defined otherwise, a monovalent residue induced from a cyclic ether having three ring-forming atoms or a compound including the cyclic ether. The epoxy group may be a glycidyl group, an epoxyalkyl group, a glycidoxyalkyl group or an alicyclic epoxy group.

In addition, the alicyclic epoxy group may refer to a monovalent residue having an aliphatic hydrocarbon ring structure, and may be derived from a compound including a structure in which two carbon atoms forming the aliphatic hydrocarbon ring also form an epoxy group. The alicyclic epoxy group may be an alicyclic epoxy group having 6 to 12 carbon atoms, for example, a 3,4-epoxycyclohexylethyl group.

In the above molar ratio (Ak/Si), a cured product exhibiting an excellent reactivity with respect to another component of the curable composition, and having excellent adhesive strength after curing and thermal and shock resistance may be provided. In Formula 9, at least one of R's is also an epoxy group. Accordingly, due to the epoxy group, (B) organopolysiloxane may suitably maintain strength and scratch resistance of the cured product, and exhibit an excellent adhesive property to a base. In one embodiment, the epoxy group may be present in such an amount that a molar ratio (Ep/Si) of the epoxy group (Ep) with respect to a total of silicon atoms (Si) included in (B) organopolysiloxane is 0.05, 0.15, 0.2, 0.3 or 0.5 or more.

The upper limit of the molar ratio (Ep/Si) may be, but is not particularly limited to, for example, 0.8. In the average composition formula of Formula 9, 1, m, r and s are molar ratios of respective siloxane units, and when the sum thereof is converted into 1, l is 0.01 to 0.3, m is 0 to 0.7, r is 0 to 0.7, and s is 0 to 0.7. Here, r and s are not simultaneously 0. To maximize strength, crack resistance and thermal and shock resistance of the cured product, and provide a cured product having an excellent adhesive strength to a base, here, (r+s)/(l+m+r+s) may be 0.2 to 0.7 or 0.3 to 0.7. The (B) organopolysiloxane may have a viscosity at 25° C. of 100, 300, 500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 6,000, 7,000, 8,000, 9,000 or 100,000 cP or more, and therefore processibility before curing and hardness after curing may be suitably maintained. The (B) organopolysiloxane may have, for example, a molecular weight of 800 or more. As the molecular weight is controlled to 800 or more, a cured product having excellent processibility and workability before curing, and excellent crack resistance, thermal and shock resistance and adhesive property to a base after curing may be provided. The upper limit of the molecular weight may be, but is not particularly limited to, for example, 5,000. Here, a molecular weight of the compound of (B) may be a weight average molecular weight, or a molecular weight of a conventional compound. A method of preparing (B) organopolysiloxane is not particularly limited, and may be, for example, a method of preparing an organopolysiloxane conventionally known or a method similar to that of preparing (A) organopolysiloxane. The (B) organopolysiloxane may be included at, for example, 0.5 to 10 or 0.5 to 5 parts by weight relative to 100 parts by weight of (A) organopolysiloxane. In such a range, a composition having an excellent adhesive property, transparency, water resistance, crack resistance and thermal and shock resistance or a cured product thereof may be provided. The curable composition may further include (C) an organopolysiloxane having a crosslinked structure. The term “crosslinked structure” used herein may refer to an organopolysiloxane including a T unit or at least one unit of tetrafunctional siloxane units (hereinafter referred to as a “Q units”) possibly and conventionally represented as (SiO2), that is, an organopolysiloxane not corresponding to that having a partially-crosslinked structure. In one embodiment, the (C) organopolysiloxane may be represented as an average composition formula of Formula 10.

In the above, at least one of R is an alkenyl group, at least one of R is an aryl group, and when d+e+f+g is converted into 1, d is 0.05 to 0.5, e is 0 to 0.3, f is 0.6 to 0.95, and g is 0 to 0.2. Here, f and g are not simultaneously 0, (d+e)/(d+e+f+g) is 0.2 to 0.7, e/(e+f+g) is 0.3 or less, and f/(f+g) is 0.8 or more. In Formula 10, one or at least two of R may be alkenyl groups. In one embodiment, the alkenyl group may be present in such an amount that a molar ratio (Ak/Si) of the alkenyl group with respect to a total of silicon atoms (Si) included in (C) organopolysiloxane is 0.05 to 0.4 or 0.05 to 0.35. As the molar ratio (Ak/Si) is controlled to 0.05 or more, reactivity with another component may be suitably maintained, and a phenomenon of leaking a non-reacted component from a surface of a cured product may be prevented. In addition, as the molar ratio (Ak/Si) is controlled to 0.4 or 0.35 or less, the hardness, crack resistance and thermal and shock resistance of the cured product may be excellently maintained. In Formula 10, at least one of R may be an aryl group. Accordingly, the refractive index and hardness of the cured product may be effectively controlled. The aryl group may be present at such an amount that a molar ratio (Ar/Si) of the aryl group (Ar) with respect to a total of silicon atoms (Si) included in (C) organopolysiloxane is 0.5 to 1.5 or 0.5 to 1.2. As the molar ratio (Ar/Si) is controlled to 0.5 or more, the refractive index and hardness of the cured product may be maximized, and as the molar ratio (Ar/Si) is controlled to 1.5 or 1.2 or less, the viscosity and thermal and shock resistance of the composition may be suitably maintained. In the average composition formula of Formula 10, d, e, f and g refer to molar ratios of respective siloxane units, and when the sum thereof is converted into 1, d is 0.05 to 0.5, e is 0 to 0.3, f is 0.6 to 0.95, and g is 0 to 0.2. However, f and g are not simultaneously 0. To maximize the strength, crack resistance and thermal and shock resistance of the cured product, here, (d+e)/(d+e+f+g) may be controlled to 0.2 to 0.7, e/(e+f+g) may be controlled to 0.3 or less, and f/(f+g) may be controlled to 0.8 or more. Here, the lower limit of e/(e+f+g) may be, but is not particularly limited to, for example, more than 0. In addition, here, the upper limit of f/(f+g) may be, but is not particularly limited to, for example, 1.0. The (C) organopolysiloxane may have a viscosity at 25° C. of 5,000 or 10,000 cP or more, and therefore processibility before curing and hardness after curing may be suitably maintained. The (C) organopolysiloxane may have a molecular weight of, for example, 800 to 20,000 or 800 to 10,000. As the molecular weight is controlled to 800 or more, moldability before curing or strength after curing may be effectively maintained, and as the molecular weight may be controlled to 20,000 or 10,000 or less, viscosity may be maintained at a suitable level. A method of preparing the (C) organopolysiloxane is not particularly limited, but may employ a preparing method conventionally known in the related art, or a similar method to that for preparing (A) organopolysiloxane. For example, the (C) organopolysiloxane may be mixed at 50 to 1,000 or 50 to 700 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of (A) organopolysiloxane. As the weight ratio of (C) organopolysiloxane is controlled to 50 parts by weight or more, strength of a cured product may be excellently maintained, and the weight ratio of (C) organopolysiloxane is controlled to 1000 or 700 parts by weight or less, a crack resistance and thermal and shock resistance may be excellently maintained.

The compound of (D) may serve as a crosslinking agent crosslinking the curable composition. As the compound of (D), various kinds of compounds including a hydrogen atom (Si—H) binding to a silicon atom may be used.

In one embodiment, a molar ratio (H/Si) of hydrogen atoms (H) binding to silicon atoms with respect to a total of silicon atoms (Si) included in the compound of (D) may be 0.2 to 0.8 or 0.3 to 0.75. As the molar ratio is controlled to 0.2 or 0.3 or more, curability of the composition may be excellently maintained, and as the molar ratio is controlled to 0.8 or 0.75 or less, crack resistance and thermal and shock resistance may be excellently maintained. In addition, the compound of (D) may include at least one aryl group, and therefore, at least one of R in Formula 11 or at least one of R in Formula 12 may be an aryl group. Accordingly, a refractive index and hardness of the cured product may be effectively controlled. The aryl group may be present at such an amount that a molar ratio (Ar/Si) of the aryl groups (Ar) with respect to a total of silicon atoms (Si) included in the compound of (D) is 0.5 to 1.5 or 0.5 to 1.3. As the molar ratio (Ar/Si) is controlled to 0.5 or more, a refractive index and hardness of the cured product may be maximized, and as the molar ratio (Ar/Si) is controlled to 1.5 or 1.3 or less, a viscosity and crack resistance of the composition may be suitably maintained. The compound of (D) may have a viscosity at 25° C. of 0.1 to 100,000, 0.1 to 10,000, 0.1 to 1,000 or 0.1 to 300 cP. As the compound of (D) has the above viscosity, processibility of the composition and hardness of the cured product may be excellently maintained. The compound of (D) may have a molecular weight of, for example, less than 2,000, 1,000 or 800. When the molecular weight of the compound of (D) is 1,000 or more, strength of the cured product may be degraded. The lower limit of the molecular weight of the compound of (D) is not particularly limited, and may be, for example, 250. In the compound of (D), the molecular weight may refer to a weight average molecular weight, or a conventional molecular weight of the compound. A method of preparing the compound of (D) is not particularly limited, and for example, may employ a preparing method conventionally known in the related art, or a similar method to that for preparing (A) organopolysiloxane. In one embodiment, a content of the compound of (D) may be determined according to an amount of an alkenyl group having a different component in the curable composition such as (A) organopolysiloxane. In one embodiment, the compound of (D) may be selected in such a range that a molar ratio (H/Ak) of hydrogen atoms (H) binding to a silicon atoms included in the compound of (D) with respect to a total of alkenyl groups (Ak) included in the curable composition is 0.5 to 2.0 or 0.7 to 1.5. Here, the alkenyl group included in the curable composition, for example, may be an alkenyl group included in the components of (A), (B) and/or (C). In the molar ratio (H/Ak), the composition exhibiting excellent processibility and workability before curing, excellent crack resistance, hardness, thermal and shock resistance and an adhesive property after curing, and having no whitening or surface stickiness under severe conditions may be provided. A content of the compound of (D) may be, for example, 50 to 500 or 50 to 400 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the compound of (A). In one embodiment, components included in the curable composition may all include an aryl group binding to a silicon atom. In this case, a molar ratio (Ar/Si) of a total of aryl groups (Ar) included in the curable composition with respect to a total of silicon atoms (Si) included in the curable composition may be 0.5 or more. A total of silicon atoms or aryl groups included in the curable composition may be silicon atoms or aryl groups included in the component(s) of (A), (B), (C) and/or (D). As the molar ratio (Ar/Si) is controlled to 0.5 or more, light transmittance, refractive index, viscosity, crack resistance and hardness of the cured product may be maximized. Here, the upper limit of the molar ratio (Ar/Si) of the aryl group is not particularly limited, and may be, for example, 2.0 or 1.5. The curable composition may include particles, for example, inorganic particles. The inorganic particles may have a refractive index in a range in which an absolute value of a difference in refractive index between the composition and the cured product is 0.15 or less. The particles may prevent a problem of precipitating a phosphor in a curing operation when the phosphor is mixed into the composition, or improve overall reliability by enhancing thermal resistance, protection against heat and crack resistance. In addition, the particles may serve as described above due to the above range of the refractive index, and maintain transparency of the composition or cured product, thereby enhancing brightness when applied to a device. As the particles, various kinds of particles used in the related art having the absolute value of the difference in refractive index between the composition excluding the particles and the cured product thereof of 0.15 or less may be used. The particles may have the absolute value of the difference in refractive index between the composition excluding the particles and the cured product thereof of 0.1 or 0.07 or less. For example, the particles may be silica (SiO2), organosilica, alumina, alumino silica, titania, zirconia, cesium oxide, hafnium oxide, niobium pentoxide, tantalum pentoxide, indium oxide, tin oxide, indium tin oxide, zinc oxide, silicon, zinc sulfide, calcium carbonate, barium sulfate, aluminosilicate or magnesium oxide, and may be porous or hollow particles. The particles may have an average diameter of, for example, 1 nm to 50 μm or 2 nm to 10 μm. When the average diameter is 1 nm or more, the particles may be uniformly dispersed in the composition or cured product thereof, and when the average diameter is 50 μm or less, the dispersion of the particles may be effectively performed, and precipitation of the particles may be prevented. The particles may be included at 0.1 to 30 or 0.2 to 10 parts by weight with respect to 100 parts by weight of the compound of (A). When a content of the particles is 0.1 parts by weight or more, excellent inhibition of the precipitation of a phosphor or enhancement of reliability of the device may be ensured, and when a content of the particles is 30 parts by weight or less, processibility may be excellently maintained. The composition may further include a hydroxylation catalyst. As a hydroxylation catalyst, all conventional components known in the related art may be used. As such a catalyst, a platinum-, palladium- or rhodium-based catalyst may be used. In the specification, a platinum-based catalyst may be used in consideration of catalyst efficiency, and may be, but is not limited to, chloroplatinic acid, platinum tetrachloride, an olefin complex of platinum, an alkenyl siloxane complex of platinum or a carbonyl complex of platinum. A content of the hydroxylation catalyst is not particularly limited as long as the hydroxylation catalyst is included at a catalytic amount, that is, an amount capable of serving as a catalyst. Conventionally, the hydroxylation catalyst may be used at 0.1 to 500 ppm or 0.2 to 100 ppm based on an atomic weight of platinum, palladium or rhodium. Another aspect of the present application provides a semiconductor device. The illustrative semiconductor device may be encapsulated by an encapsulant including a cured product of the curable composition. Examples of a semiconductor device encapsulated by an encapsulant include a diode, a transistor, a thyristor, a photocoupler, a CCD, a solid-phase image pick-up diode, a monolithic IC, a hybrid IC, an LSI, a VLSI or an LED. In one embodiment, the semiconductor device may be a light emitting diode. The light emitting diode may be one formed by stacking a semiconductor material on a substrate. The semiconductor material may be, but is not limited to, GaAs, GaP, GaAlAs, GaAsP, AlGaInP, GaN, InN, AlN, InGaAlN or SiC. In addition, as the substrate, sapphire, spinel, SiC, Si, ZnO or GaN monocrystal may be used. In addition, to prepare the light emitting diode, when necessary, a buffer layer may be formed between a substrate and a semiconductor material. As a buffer layer, GaN or AlN may be used. A method of stacking a semiconductor material on a substrate may be, but is not particularly limited to, MOCVD, HDVPE or liquid growth. In addition, a structure of the light emitting diode may be, for example, a monojunction including an MIS junction, a PN junction, and a PIN junction, a heterojunction, or a double heterojunction. In addition, the light emitting diode may be formed using a mono or multiple quantum well structure. In one embodiment, an emission wavelength of the light emitting diode may be, for example, 250 to 550 nm, 300 to 500 nm or 330 to 470 nm. The emission wavelength may refer to a main emission peak wavelength. As the emission wavelength of the light emitting diode is set in the above range, a white light emitting diode having a longer life span, high energy efficiency and high color expression may be obtained. The light emitting diode may be encapsulated using the composition. In addition, the encapsulation of the light emitting diode may be performed only using the composition, and in some cases, another encapsulant may be used in combination with the composition. When two kinds of encapsulants are used in combination, after the encapsulation using the composition, the encapsulated light emitting diode may also be encapsulated with another encapsulant, or the light emitting diode may be encapsulated with another encapsulant and then encapsulated again with the composition. As another encapsulant, an epoxy resin, a silicon resin, an acryl resin, a urea resin, an imide resin or glass may be used. To encapsulate the light emitting diode with the composition, for example, a method including previously injecting the composition into a mold-type mould, dipping a read frame to which the light emitting diode is fixed therein and curing the composition, or a method including injecting the composition into a mold into which the light emitting diode is inserted and curing the composition. As a method of injecting the composition, injection by a dispenser, transfer molding or injection molding may be used. In addition, as other encapsulating methods, a method of dropping the composition on the light emitting diode, coating the composition by screen printing or using a mask, and curing the composition, and a method of injecting the composition into a cup in which the light emitting diode is disposed on its bottom by a dispenser and curing the composition may be included. In addition, the composition may be used as a diamond material fixing the light emitting diode to a read terminal or package, or a passivation layer or package substrate on the light emitting diode when necessary. When it is necessary to cure the composition, the curing is not particularly limited, and may be performed, for example, by maintaining the composition at a temperature of 60 to 200° C. for 10 minutes to 5 hours, or in phases with at least two steps at a suitable temperature and for a suitable time. A shape of the encapsulant is not particularly limited, and for example, may be a bullet-type lens, plane, or thin film shape. In addition, additional enhancement of performance of the light emitting diode may be promoted according to the conventional method known in the related art. To enhance the performance, for example, a method of disposing a reflective layer or light collecting layer on a back surface of the light emitting diode, a method of forming a complementary coloring part on its bottom, a method of disposing a layer absorbing light having a shorter wavelength than the main emission peak on the light emitting diode, a method of encapsulating the light emitting diode and further molding the light emitting diode with a lightweight material, a method of inserting the light emitting diode into a through hole to be fixed, or a method of contacting the light emitting diode with a read member by flip-chip contact to extract light from a direction of the substrate may be used. The light emitting diode may be effectively applied to, for example, backlights for liquid crystal displays (LCDs), lights, various kinds of sensors, light sources of a printer and a copy machine, light sources for a mobile gauge, signal lights, pilot lights, display devices, light sources of planar-type light emitting diodes, displays, decorations or various kinds of lights.
