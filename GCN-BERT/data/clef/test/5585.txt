To a solution of tert-butyl (1-(but-3-yn-1-ylsulfonyl)piperidin-4-yl)carbamate (13a, 253 mg, 0.8 mmol) in DCM (8 mL) was added methanesulfonic acid (318 Î¼L, 4.8 mmol), and the resulting solution stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. The volatiles were evaporated and the residue suspended in ethyl ether (15 mL). The ether was decanted and the solid dried under high vacuum at room temperature to give 1-(but-3-yn-1-ylsulfonyl)piperidin-4-amine methanesulfonate (Intermediate 13, 248 mg, 99%) as a white solid.
