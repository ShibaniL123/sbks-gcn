Step 2. (R)-3-(5-((3-Aminopiperidin-1-yl)sulfonyl)-2-methylphenyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-8-amine tris(2,2,2-trifluoroacetate)
A solution of tert-butyl (R)-(1-((3-(8-amino-6-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazin-3-yl)-4-methylphenyl)sulfonyl)piperidin-3-yl)carbamate (0.019 g, 0.034 mmol) in dichloromethane (0.86 mL) was treated with TFA (0.86 mL) and stirred for 1 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated to a residue. Purification by preparative LCMS (XBridge C18 Column, eluting with a gradient of acetonitrile in water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, at flow rate of 60 mL/min) gave the desired product (22 mg, 79%).
