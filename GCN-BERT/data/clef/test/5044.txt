TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to 3-ketocoumarines which can be used as photoinitiators in LED photocuring and to a process for photocuring compositions comprising said 3-ketocoumarines. PRIOR ART Photopolymerizable systems contain photoinitiators that possess in the molecule a functional group which, by exposure to light radiation of appropriate wavelength, generate radicals able to initiate the polymerization. Among the light radiation sources used in this field, light emitting diodes (LED), a semiconductor light source, have been the subject of significant development over the past few years because of the advantages of low temperature operation and extremely long life in comparison with conventional medium pressure mercury arc curing lamps. LED lamps are advantageous because of the inherently small size of LED units, their longer lifetime, their robustness and their ability to be easily engineered, for example into commercial printing systems. When using LED lamps to photocure inks and coatings, it is necessary to use selected photoinitiator systems that are tuned to the wavelength of this light source. While Mercury arc lamps typically have a polychromatic emission spectrum, emitting light in all regions of the UV-visible spectrum from 200 to 450 nm, LED lamps usually have only a single emission band in the range 365-420 nm. Photoinitiators, absorbing in the region between 365 nm and 420 nm and, are thus required to make full use of the recent development of LEDs with increasing power. Moreover, since high concentration of photoactive substance are usually required for LED applications, the photoinitiators should have a high compatibility with the photopolymerizable system. Thioxanthones, such as isopropyl thioxanthone (ITX) and its derivatives, and acyl phosphine oxides are photoinitiators commonly used in this field. Unfortunately, the thioxanthone derivatives commonly used both as photoinitiators and sensitizers are prone to yellowing upon exposure, thereby forming degradation products with limited stability. As a result, the original yellowing can shift unpredictably upon storage. Especially in imaging, e.g. inkjet printing, this unstable yellowing behavior makes quite difficult the control of the image tone in the final image. Acyl phosphine oxides initiators, on the other hand, result in medium volatile aldehyde type of degradation products, producing a background smell of the cured coatings or the printed image, which is no more acceptable. Moreover, the use of high amounts of acyl phosphine oxides initiators creates several health and safety problems. Alpha-diketones, such as camphorquinone and its derivatives and 1-phenyl propandione, are examples of different photoinitiators which have been used in combination with LED light sources, particularly for dental applications, but unfortunately their activity is quite low, in particular in pigmented system. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for the development of different photoinitiators, absorbing in the region between 365 nm and 420 nm, having a predictable yellowing behavior, good photochemical reactivity, no odorous degradation products and no health or safety drawbacks. Coumarine derivatives have been proposed for a long time as photoinitiators and, in particular, as sensitizers working at wavelengths up to about 550 nm, but always using broad spectrum actinic lamps. GB 1,578,662 describe a composition comprising an unsaturated radiation sensitive material or a photopolymerizable azide material which material contains, as sensitizer, a 3-substituted coumarin compound, which can be also a 3-ketocoumarine. U.S. Pat. No. 4,278,751 discloses a photopolymerizable composition containing at least a polymerizable compound containing ethylenic unsaturations, a photopolymerization activator (photoinitiator) and an amine substituted ketocoumarine sensitizer. Light sources which may be used include broad spectrum light sources, filtered or unfiltered, including Xenon or carbon arcs, narrow spectrum sources such as mercury lamps. U.S. Pat. No. 4,289,844 discloses a photopolymerizable composition containing at least a polymerizable compound having an polymerizable compound containing ethylenic unsaturation, a photopolymerization activator (photoinitiator) and a sensitizer, selected among 3-ketocoumarines containing C1-C12 alkyl or alkenyl group or carbocyclic or heterocyclic group having 5-20 carbon and hetero atoms. In this patent a medium pressure mercury lamp is used as light source. Surprisingly, we have found that specific derivatives of aromatic 3-ketocoumarines show a high cure speed on exposure to LED light source with wavelength comprised between 365 and 420 nm compared with state of the art photoinitiators and other 3-ketocoumarines. They do not show undesired yellowing behavior and maintain at the same time superior compatibility with photopolymerizable systems. Therefore the object of the present invention are specific aromatic derivatives of 3-ketocoumarine and a process for photocuring photopolymerizable compositions including these aromatic derivatives both as photoinitiators and as sensitizers. Such photopolymerizable compositions have been found to be suitable for inclusion in ink or coating compositions which are curable on exposure to radiation from a LED light source. In the present text, with sensitizer we mean a compound that, through a process of energy transfer, activates the photoinitiator at wavelength where the photoinitiator alone would not be reactive.

The 3-ketocoumarines of formula I work both in transparent photopolymerizable compositions and in non-transparent or colored compositions and, in particular, are useful for the preparation of inks photopolymerizable with a LED light source. These photoinitiators are particularly suited for the preparation of photopolymerizable inks for ink-jet printing. For this reason the photopolymerizable composition of the invention can further comprise from 0.01 to 30% by weight of colorants. Colorants which can be used in the LED photopolymerizable inks of the invention are dyes, pigments or a combination thereof. Organic and/or inorganic pigments may be used.

For LED photopolymerizable white inks, the white colorants are preferably present in an amount of 3% to 30% by weight of the ink composition, and more preferably 5% to 25%. Usually the other colorants are present in the LED photopolymerizable inks of the invention in the range of 0.01 to 10% by weight, preferably in the range of 0.1 to 5% by weight. Colorants for ink-jet printing are particularly preferred. In addition to the main components, the LED photopolymerizable inks can contain also other specific ingredients such as co-initiators and other photoinitiators, such as those described in the preceding paragraphs and in the same amount, dispersants, surfactants and other additives which are well known to the expert in the art. The choice of these components is not particularly limited. The dispersants are added to the inks so as to enhance the dispersibility of the pigment. For the realization of the present invention, a dispersant that is generally used for preparing a pigment-dispersed liquid, such as a polymeric dispersant, can be used. Examples of such polymeric dispersant include polyoxyalkylene, polyalkylene polyamines, vinyl polymers and copolymers, acrylic polymers and copolymers, polyesters, polyamides, polyimides, polyurethanes, amino polymers, silicon-containing polymers, sulfur-containing polymers, fluorine-containing polymers, and epoxy resins.
