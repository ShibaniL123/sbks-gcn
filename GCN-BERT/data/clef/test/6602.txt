BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention is generally related to liquid bird feeders and, in particular, to such bird feeders which may foe filled without inversion. 2. Description of the Prior Art Liquid nectar bird feeders are used for specifically attracting hummingbirds in the same manner as seed feeders are used to attract other birds. Some may consider liquid nectar feeders to be less convenient however, because of the liquid auto-feed structure. Filling liquid feeders commonly requires inversion of the feeder and certain liquid spillage from this action. It is therefore desirable to have a liquid nectar feeder which minimizes liquid spillage during filling and which even avoids inversion during filling. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one embodiment of the present invention, a liquid bird feeder, comprises a liquid container having a scalable top opening and a bottom opening, a liquid tray adapted to immerse the bottom opening in liquid, and a valve mechanism adapted to close the bottom opening to enable the liquid container to be filled through the sealable top opening. The liquid container may include a vertically oriented cylindrical extension forming the bottom opening. The liquid tray may include a vertically oriented cylindrical collar adapted to connect to the cylindrical extension of the liquid container. The cylindrical collar may include a cylindrical side wall having a liquid port located therein. The valve mechanism may include a rotatable cylindrical member having an opening adapted to selectively align and misalign with the port in the cylindrical collar to respectively open or close the port with rotation of the rotatable cylindrical member. The cylindrical collar may include a plurality of ports and the rotatable cylindrical member may include a corresponding plurality of openings adapted to simultaneously align or misalign with the plurality of ports for respectively opening and closing all of the plurality of ports simultaneously with rotation of the rotatable cylindrical member. The rotatable cylindrical member may be adapted to be at least partially immersed in liquid within the liquid tray and may include an actuator which extends above the port in the cylindrical collar, and thus above a normal liquid level in the liquid tray. The liquid tray may include a tray cover having one or more feeding ports passing there through and a slot adapted to allow the actuator to be operable from outside of the tray cover to rotate the rotatable cylindrical member. The liquid container may include a top cover adapted to seal the top opening. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The present invention is illustratively shown and described in reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: FIG. 1 is a sectional side view of a bird feeder constructed in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 2 is an enlarged, partial sectional, side view of the embodiment of FIG. 1, showing greater detail and having a component is located in a different operative position from the view of FIG. 1. FIG. 3 is a top view of the bird feeder of FIGS. 1 and 2 showing approximate cross sectional cut lines used for FIGS. 1 and. 2. FIG. 4 is a perspective view of two components used in the bird feeder of FIGS. 1-3. FIG. 5 is a different perspective view of the bird feeder components of FIG. 4. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS In describing preferred embodiments of the present invention illustrated in the drawings, specific terminology is employed for the sake of clarity. However, the invention is not intended to be limited to the specific terminology so selected, and it is to be understood that each specific element includes all technical equivalents that operate in a similar manner to accomplish a similar purpose. FIG. 1 generally shows a sectional side view of a bird feeder 10, which generally includes a reservoir or liquid container 12 and a liquid tray 14. Liquid container 12 includes a scalable top opening 16 having a cover 18 adapted to seal top opening 16. Cover 18 includes peripheral threads 20 adapted to engage liquid container 12 and an O-ring seal 22 located to create an air tight seal. FIG. 2 shows an enlarged sectional side view of the lower portion of bird feeder 10. Liquid container 12 also includes a bottom opening 24 formed by a cylindrical extension 26 of the lower end 12a of liquid container 12. Bottom opening 24 and liquid tray 14 are oriented to immerse bottom opening 24 in liquid from liquid container 12. This arrangement allows a vacuum created in the upper end 12b of the liquid container 12 to retain liquid therein and automatically feed liquid into liquid tray 14 to the level of bottom opening 24. Liquid tray 14 includes a vertically oriented, cylindrical collar 30, which extends upwardly and is adapted to engage cylindrical extension 26 of liquid container 12. Cylindrical collar 30 is axially closed at its lower end by formation with liquid tray 14, but includes one or more ports 32 formed in the cylindrical side wall 34. Bird feeder 10 further includes a valve mechanism 38 including a rotatable cylindrical member 40. Cylindrical member 40 includes one or more openings 42 adapted to either align with a port 32 or misalign in response to the rotation of valve mechanism. 38 and rotatable cylindrical member 40. FIG. 2 shows opening 42 in alignment with a port 32 covered by a portion of rotatable cylindrical member 40, thus effecting closure of ports 32. FIG. 3 shows the approximate cross section used for FIGS. 1 and 2. However, the angled leg of the cross section line C-C is slightly different between FIGS. 1 and 2, because the cross section passes through actuator handle 48, which is in different positions in FIGS. 1 and 2. FIGS. 4 and 5 show respective upper and lower perspective views of the liquid tray 14 and valve mechanism 38. FIG. 4 shows cylindrical collar 30 to have a plurality of ports 32, and FIG. 5 shows rotatable cylindrical member 40 to have a plurality of openings 42. Ports 32 and openings 42 are located at the same angular positions around the their respective cylindrical axes to cause simultaneous misalignment or alignment between all ports 32 and openings 42, thus allowing bottom opening 24 to be selectively closed or opened. Valve mechanism 38 further includes a circular disk 46 and an actuator handle 48, which are shown to extend above the level of port 32 in FIGS. 1 and 2. This enables activation of valve mechanism 38 even while there is liquid present in liquid tray. Now returning to FIGS. 1 and 2, liquid tray 14 further includes a cover 50 adapted to substantially close liquid tray 14 and limit access to any liquid contents thereof. Cover 50 includes a plurality of bird feeder ports 52 adapted to allow access by long-beaked hummingbirds while simultaneously preventing access by bees. Cover 50 further includes a slot 54 to allow the actuator handle 48 to extend outside of liquid tray 14. The unique construction of bird feeder 10 thus allows filling thereof without necessitating inversion and undesired dripping or spillage of liquid nectar. It is now apparent to those skilled in the art that other embodiments, improvements, details, and uses can be made consistent with the letter and spirit of the foregoing disclosure and within the scope of this patent, which is limited only by the following claims, construed in accordance with the patent law, including the doctrine of equivalents. 1-19.
