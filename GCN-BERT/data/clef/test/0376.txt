Example 23. Preparation of N-(3-(3-(4-methylpiperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)-N-phenylpentaneamide (LMT-838)
The N-phenyl-N-(3-(3-(piperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)pentaneamide (50 mg, 0.124 mmol) obtained in Example 22 and formaldehyde (37% in H2O; 1.5 ml) were dissolved in formic acid (2.0 ml), heated at 100 Â°C, refluxed, and stirred for 4 hours. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure, and titrated by adding a sodium hydroxide aqueous solution (2.0 M). Afterward, the reaction product was diluted with dichloromethane, and washed with water and brine. An organic solvent layer was collected, dehydrated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography (CH2Cl2:MeOH=20:1), thereby obtaining N-(3-(3-(4-methylpiperazine-1-carbonyl)phenyl)prop-2-ynyl)-N-phenylpentaneamide (24 mg, 46% yield).
