Preparation of trans-N-(3-(2-Benzylldenehydrazine-1-carbonyl)-4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloro-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamide (F3001)
To a solution of trans-2,2-dichloro-N-(4-chloro-3-(hydrazinecarbonyl)phenyl)-3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)cyclopropane-1-carboxamide hydrochloride (F2567) (0.300 g, 0.60 mmol) in ethanol (8.0 mL) was added sodium acetate trihydrate (0.099 g, 1.2 mmol) at room temperature and the mixture was stirred for 15 min. Benzaldehyde (0.19 g, 1.8 mmol) was added followed by acetic acid (0.1 mL), and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. The reaction mixture was poured into water (10 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (2Ã—10 mL). The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by column chromatography using 20-40% ethyl acetate/petroleum ether as eluent afforded the title compound as a pale brown solid (0.110 g, 35%).
