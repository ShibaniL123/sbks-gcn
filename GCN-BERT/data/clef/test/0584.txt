BACKGROUND Refrigerated merchandisers are commonly utilized in the beverage industry for displaying, storing, and cooling products such as beverages, desserts, and other items. These merchandisers are typically located in convenience stores, supermarkets, amusement parks, and other retail establishments. Conventional refrigerated merchandisers are provided with a refrigerated display cabinet and a refrigeration system for providing a cooled environment within the interior space of the cabinet. The refrigeration system typically includes a compressor, an evaporator assembly comprising an evaporator and an evaporator fan, and a condenser assembly comprising a condenser and a condenser fan. The refrigeration system also includes a refrigerant to promote heat transfer. In one stage, heat transfer occurs with the ambient air surrounding the condenser coils as the refrigerant flows through the condenser. In another stage, heat transfer occurs with the air surrounding the evaporator coils as the refrigerant flows through the evaporator. The individual components of these refrigeration systems have been assembled in various configurations. Commonly, the evaporator assembly and the condenser assembly are remotely positioned within the merchandiser. Some systems employ the approach shown in U.S. Pat. No. 7,997,094 to Zangari et al., which is incorporated herein by reference, wherein the condenser assembly is located at the base of the merchandiser and the evaporator assembly is located at the top of the merchandiser. However, this configuration presents several disadvantages. Because of the separation, additional components are required to allow the refrigerant to be transferred between the assemblies. In addition, this configuration presents challenges during servicing. When a component malfunctions, the operator and technician are generally presented with two options: remove the merchandiser for servicing off-site or repair the merchandiser on-site. Regarding the former option, the merchandiser will be unavailable until the necessary repairs have been conducted, leaving the operator without a replacement merchandiser. Furthermore, the labor, travel, and repair costs increase significantly. Regarding the latter option, a technician would be required to bring all of the tools and equipment to the site without knowing the cause of the malfunction. As a result, the repair could be time-consuming and inefficient, further increasing the costs. These disadvantages can be overcome by utilizing a modular refrigeration system, also referred to as a cooling deck or a cooling cassette, wherein the condenser assembly and the evaporator assembly are mounted on a common platform. One of the advantages of these modular systems is that they can be easily replaced and removed for servicing. While modular systems have been positioned at the top of a merchandiser, locating the modular system at the base of a merchandiser presents several advantages. When at the base, servicing the modular system is easier because it is more accessible. In addition, positioning the modular system at the base allows for the refrigerated display cabinet to be raised such that the consumer has easier access to the contents stored therein. However, current modular systems also present several disadvantages. In order to meet the energy and cooling requirements, current modular systems require a significant amount of volume due to the size of the system components. In particular, the height of current modular systems is significant. In some instances, in an attempt to reduce the height and still meet the cooling requirements, at least a portion of the cooling section and/or some or all of its components (e.g., evaporator, evaporator fan) must at least partially overlap or be at least partially disposed in a vertical direction above at least a portion of the heating section and/or some or all of its components (e.g., compressor, condenser, condenser fan). Some systems employ the approach shown in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0207280 to Avila et al., which is incorporated herein by reference, wherein the evaporator assembly is raised within the refrigeration system in order to allow the air removed from the condenser assembly to exit through a channel created below the evaporator assembly. In other systems, the air is routed such that the evaporator assembly does not need to be raised. However, even in those instances, the cooling section and its components still at least partially overlap the heating section and its components because of the size of the components needed to meet the cooling requirements. Consequently, the space required by the components of current modular systems occurs at the cost of valuable storage and cooling space within the refrigerated cabinet. Furthermore, current modular systems can also be quite cumbersome and heavy. As a result, there is a need for a modular system, such as a cooling cassette, comprising a condenser assembly and an evaporator assembly that can meet the necessary energy and cooling requirements while maximizing the cooling and storage space within a refrigerated cabinet of a refrigerated merchandiser. In particular, there is a need for a cooling cassette that can meet the necessary energy and cooling requirements and provide a reduced height compared to current modular systems. SUMMARY In general, the present disclosure is directed to a cooling cassette for a refrigerated merchandiser and a refrigerated merchandiser, In particular, the present invention is directed to a cooling cassette for a refrigerated merchandiser. The cassette includes a housing. The housing includes a base plate for providing a foundation for the cassette and at least one panel positioned at the perimeter of the base plate. The cassette is partitioned to provide a cooling section and a heating section. The cooling section is disposed within the housing and includes a receptacle that is mounted within the housing. The cooling section contains a receptacle, an evaporator, and an evaporator fan. The evaporator is mounted within the receptacle together with an evaporator fan that is operatively associated with the evaporator for circulating air through the evaporator. The heating section is disposed within the housing and includes a condenser, a condenser fan operatively associated with the condenser for drawing air through the condenser, and a compressor operatively connected with the evaporator and the condenser for circulating a refrigerant through the evaporator and the condenser. The receptacle forms a partition within the housing and thermally isolates the cooling section from the heating section in a generally side-by-side disposition. The present invention is also directed to a refrigerated merchandiser that includes the cooling cassette already described. The refrigerated merchandiser includes a refrigerated cabinet comprising a top wall, a rear wall, a base, and at least two side walls that define an interior space. The refrigerated merchandiser also includes a compartment positioned beneath the cabinet.

In general, the present disclosure is directed to a cooling cassette for a refrigerated merchandiser. The cooling cassette provides a more compact configuration than current modular systems and allows for more storage and cooling space within the refrigerated cabinet of a refrigerated merchandiser. In particular, the cooling cassette provides a more compact configuration while satisfying the necessary energy and cooling requirements of a refrigerated merchandiser. Consequently, the cooling cassette also provides a more efficient cooling operation. In addition, the cooling cassette lends itself to easier maintenance than conventional modular systems. An exemplary embodiment of a cooling cassette 10 is illustrated in FIGS. 1, 2, and 3. The cooling cassette 10 includes a housing 86 that provides a structure to support the components of the cooling cassette 10. As illustrated schematically in FIG. 8 for example, the housing 86 includes a base plate 24 that forms the foundation of the cooling cassette 10. The housing 86 may also include at least one panel positioned along the perimeter of the base plate 24. In particular, the housing 86 may include at least two side panels 14 and 16, a rear panel 18, and a front panel 20 that are positioned along the perimeter of the base plate 24 to provide a frame around the perimeter of the housing 86. The rear panel 18 may be disposed opposite the front panel 20 and the side panels 14 and 16 may extend between and connect the front panel 20 to the rear panel 18. The side panels 14 and 16 may be a heating side panel 14 and a cooling side panel 16, respectively. The front panel 20 may be divided to provide a controls panel 20a and a heating side front panel 20b. A portion of the front panel, such as the heating side front panel 20b, may be attached or connected to a side panel. The heating side front panel 20b may also include a grille 22 that permits air flow. The grille 22 may be a separate component or may also be attached to form the condenser housing 44. A handle 60 may be attached to the cooling cassette 10 for worker manipulation of the position of the cooling cassette 10. For instance, the handle 60 may be attached along the front panel 20. In addition, like the front panel 20, any of the other panels may also be divided to provide a plurality of panels. The panels may also contain openings 54 for accessing the interior of the cassette 10. As shown schematically in FIG. 2 for example, a partition 12 may be disposed in the housing 86. In particular, the partition 12 may thermally insulate a cooling section 58 from a heating section 56 also disposed within the housing 86. The partition 12 may include a thermally insulated wall that is adjacent the cooling section 58 and the heating section 56. The partition 12 may be a separate component that is positioned between the cooling section 58 and the heating section 56. Alternatively, at least one wall of the receptacle 46 may serve as the partition 12. For instance, the partition 12 may divide the cassette 10 to provide a cooling section 58 and a heating section 56 generally in a side-by-side disposition. For instance, a side-by-side disposition may be distinguished from a top-bottom disposition wherein the heating section 56 and/or some or all of its components and the cooling section 58 and/or some or all of its components are in a top-bottom disposition. Unlike current modular systems, the heating section 56 and the cooling section 58 do not at least partially overlap wherein at least a portion of the cooling section 58 and/or some or all of its components are partially disposed in a vertical direction above at least a portion of the heating section 56 and/or some or all of its components, or vice versa. For instance, at least a portion of the cooling section 58 and/or some or all of its components are not positioned vertically above at least a portion of the heating section 56 and/or some or all of its components. As such, the cooling cassette 10 is more compact than current modular systems. As indicated schematically in FIG. 2 for example, the cooling section 58 and the heating section 56 are generally in a side-by-side disposition. The heating section 56 is positioned to the viewer's right side of the cooling cassette 10 in FIG. 2 and may extend from the front panel 20 rearwardly toward the rear panel 18. Generally, the heating section 56 houses the compressor 26, the condenser 28, and the condenser fan 30. The cooling section 58 is positioned to the viewer's left side of the cooling cassette 10 in FIG. 2 and opposite from the heating section 56. The cooling section 58 extends forwardly from the rear panel 18 towards the front panel 20. Generally, the cooling section 58 houses the evaporator 32 and the evaporator fan 34. In addition, it should be understood that the cooling section 58 may be positioned on the viewer's right side and the heating section 56 may be positioned on the viewer's left side of the cooling cassette 10 in the view depicted in FIG. 2. As indicated, the cooling section 58 and the heating section 56 are generally in a side-by-side disposition which may be distinguished from a top-bottom disposition. For instance, the cooling section 58 and/or some or all of its components are not positioned vertically above the compressor 26, the condenser 28, and/or the condenser fan 30 of the heating section 56. Similarly, the heating section 56 and/or some or all of its components are not positioned vertically above the evaporator 32 and/or the evaporator fan 34. The compressor 26 is utilized as in the conventional refrigeration cycle to compress a refrigerant that is circulated through the refrigerant lines (not shown). As shown schematically in FIG. 2 for example, the compressor 26 is disposed within the heating section 58 of the cassette 10 and may be positioned downstream from a condenser fan 30 such that air flows through the condenser fan 30 before reaching the compressor 26. The compressor 26 may be mounted to the base plate 24 either directly or indirectly. As shown schematically in FIG. 1, the compressor 26 is mounted to a compressor mounting surface 42 that may be elevated vertically above the base plate 24. Alternatively, the compressor 26 may be mounted directly to the base plate 24. The compressor 26 may be mounted using any method known in the art, such as a bracket. The condenser 28 is utilized as in the conventional refrigeration cycle to condense a refrigerant that is circulated through the refrigerant lines (not shown). As schematically shown in FIG. 2 for example, the condenser 28 is disposed within the heating section 56 of the cassette 10. The condenser 28 may be mounted above a condenser pan (not shown). The condenser pan may be mounted to or integrally formed in the base plate 24. As schematically shown in FIG. 1 for example, the condenser 28 may be enclosed within a condenser housing 44. The condenser 28 and the condenser housing 44 may be attached to the base plate 24 using any method known in the art such as a bracket, The condenser 28 is operatively associated with the condenser fan 30 which is also disposed within the heating section 56 of the cassette 10. The condenser fan 30 can be mounted to the condenser housing 44 and/or the base plate 24 using any method known in the art such as a bracket. Generally, as schematically shown in FIG. 1 for example, the condenser fan 30 may be disposed adjacent the condenser 28 and downstream with respect to air flow from the condenser 28. For instance, the condenser fan 30 may direct air flow through the condenser 28 to remove heat from the condenser 28. The air may then flow through the condenser fan 30 and over the compressor 26. As such, the condenser fan 30 may draw air to cool the condenser 28 as well as the compressor 26. As schematically shown in FIG. 1 for example, the heated air may then exit the cooling cassette 10 through a rear opening 54 in the rear panel 18. In order to reduce the heat transfer between air flows, the direction of air flow exiting the heating section 56 is substantially parallel to the direction of the air flow circulating through the evaporator 32 of the cooling section 58. In another embodiment, the direction of air flow entering the condenser fan 30 is substantially parallel to the direction of the air flow circulating through the evaporator 32 of the cooling section 58. For instance, the air flows generally in the same direction. The cooling cassette 10 may also include a receptacle 46, as shown in FIGS. 1-5, 8, and 9. The receptacle 46 may be a preformed tub or basin, such as a preformed styrofoam tub or basin, that is open at the top, is formed by a bottom disposed vertically opposite the top, and is formed from at least four sides extending vertically and/or diagonally from the bottom and connected to form a continuous sidewall. For instance, the side walls may extend in the vertical direction or slightly angled with respect to the vertical direction. According to one embodiment, the receptacle 46 houses the cooling section 58 components of the cooling cassette 10. In addition, the receptacle 46 partitions and thermally insulates the cooling section 58 components such as the evaporator 32 and the evaporator fan 34 from the heating section 56 components such as the compressor 26, the condenser 28, and the condenser fan 30. Maintaining this temperature differential as large as possible increases the efficiency of the cooling cassette 10. The receptacle 46 may be insulated using any method known in the art. For instance, the receptacle 46 may be insulated using any insulating material known in the art. For instance, in one embodiment, the insulating material may be a polystyrene. The insulating material may substantially surround the perimeter walls of the receptacle 46. The receptacle 46 may also be produced from an insulating material. For instance, it may be produced from a polystyrene. Furthermore, a metal sheet 88, such as a sheet made from steel or aluminum, may contact or be connected to at least one outer wall of the receptacle 46. In particular, the metal sheet 88, such as a sheet made from steel or aluminum, may be connected to at least one outer wall of the receptacle 46 adjacent the heating section 56. As such, in conjunction with a cover plate 66 as shown schematically in FIGS. 3 and 6 for example, the receptacle 46 is designed so that the cooling section 58 is substantially insulated from the heating section 56. In particular, the cover plate 66 is designed so that at least a portion of the cooling section and/or some or all of its components 58 do not overlap or are not disposed at least partially above a portion of the heating section 56 and/or some or all of its components, or vice versa. As shown schematically in FIGS. 1-3 for example, the receptacle 46 provides a basin to house an evaporator 32 that is operatively associated with an evaporator fan 34. The evaporator 32 and the evaporator fan 34 are disposed within the receptacle wherein the disposition creates an air return chamber 38 and an air supply chamber 40 separate from the air return chamber 38 within the receptacle 46. The evaporator 32 is utilized as in the conventional refrigeration cycle to evaporate a refrigerant that is circulated through the refrigerant lines (not shown). As schematically shown in FIG. 2 for example, the evaporator 32 is mounted within the receptacle 46. The evaporator 32 may be mounted to the receptacle 46 using any method known in the art. In particular, the ends of the evaporator 32 may rest on the receptacle 46 in grooves or notches 50. As schematically shown in FIG. 2 for example, the evaporator fan 34 is mounted within the receptacle 46. The evaporator fan 34 may be mounted to the receptacle 46 and/or the evaporator 32 using any method known in the art. Generally, the evaporator fan 34 is mounted within or adjacent the return chamber 38. The evaporator fan 34 may be mounted such that it is parallel with the vertical or angled with respect to the vertical. The evaporator fan 34 is utilized to circulate air through the evaporator 32. Generally, the evaporator fan 34 is located upstream from the evaporator 32 such that the air enters the evaporator fan 34 through the return chamber 38 prior to entering the evaporator 32. Generally, air is provided from a refrigerated cabinet operatively associated with the cooling cassette 10 through return chamber 38 to the evaporator fan 34 and evaporator 32 from which the air is then supplied back to the refrigerated cabinet through supply chamber 40. In addition, the supply chamber 40 may be shaped so as to provide cooled air across the width or back of the rear wall of a refrigerated cabinet operatively associated with the cooling cassette 10. For instance, at least one side wall of the supply chamber 40 may be angled with respect to the vertical in order to direct air flow substantially along the width or back of the rear wall of a refrigerated cabinet operatively associated with the cooling cassette 10. For instance, air flow is directed across at least 50%, such as at least 65%, such as at least 80%, such as at least 90% of the width of the back of the rear wall of a refrigerated cabinet. Generally, the air flow in the air return chamber 38 prior to entering the evaporator fan 34 does not overlap or is not disposed vertically above the air flow entering the heating section 56, such as the air flowing through and/or exiting the condenser housing 44, condenser 28, and/or condenser fan 30. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the bottom or base of the receptacle 46 is positioned such that it is not disposed above some or all of the components of the heating section 56. For instance, the bottom or base of the receptacle 46 may be positioned adjacent or proximate the base plate 24 of the housing 86. The receptacle 46 has a first end 62 proximate the rear panel 18 and a second and opposite end 64 proximate the front panel 20. The first end 62 proximate the rear panel 18 may be adjacent the supply chamber 40 while the second end 64 proximate the front panel 20 may be adjacent the return chamber 38. A controls panel 36 may also be located adjacent the second end 64. The first end 62 and/or the supply chamber 40 may extend substantially along the distance between the two side panels 14 and 16. For instance, the first end 62 may extend at least 40%, such as at least 50%, such as at least 70%, such as at least 80%, such as at least 90% of the distance between the two side panels 14 and 16. In one embodiment, the first end 62 may extend from 40% to 90% of the distance between the two side panels 14 and 16. In one embodiment, the first end 62 may extend across the entire distance between the two side panels 14 and 16. Generally, the first end 62 is relatively wider than the second end 64 such that the first end 62 extends a greater distance between the side panels 14 and 16 than the second end 64. The receptacle 46 may also have a third end 82 and a fourth and opposite end 84. Generally, the third end 82 is proximate a side panel, such as side panel 16, and the fourth end 84 is proximate the heating section 58. The fourth end 84 and/or the second end 64 may provide the partition 12 that thermally insulates the cooling section 58 from the heating section 56 and promotes the generally side-by-side disposition of the heating section 56 and the cooling section 58. The fourth end 84 may have a portion that is substantially vertical and a portion that is angled with respect to the vertical. Generally, the receptacle 46 may extend substantially along the distance between the front panel 20 and the rear panel 18. For instance, the receptacle 46 and the cooling section 58 may extend from the rear panel 18 forwardly towards the front panel 20. The receptacle 46 and cooling section 58 may extend at least about 70%, such as at least about 80%, such as at least about 90%, such as at least about 100% of the distance between the front panel 20 and the rear panel 18. As shown schematically in FIGS. 4 and 5 for example, the receptacle 46 is mounted within the housing 86 of the cassette 10. The receptacle 46 can be mounted to the base plate 24 using any method known in the art. The receptacle 46 can be positioned above an evaporator pan 48. The evaporator pan 48 can be mounted to the base plate 24 or integrally formed in the base plate 24. The receptacle 46 may also include a drain 52 for access to the evaporator pan 48. Condensate from the evaporator 32 drains to the evaporator pan 48 where it is evaporated. The evaporator pan 48 may also include a drain hole that is connected to a drain conduit for discharging any condensate. Furthermore, the receptacle 46, containing the evaporator 32 and evaporator fan 34, is positioned on the viewer's left side of the cooling cassette 10. However, it should be understood that the receptacle 46, containing the evaporator 32 and evaporator fan 34, may also be positioned along the viewer's right side of the cooling cassette 10. As shown schematically in FIGS. 3 and 6 for example, the cooling cassette 10 may also include a cover plate 66. The cover plate 66 may generally be located at the top of the cooling cassette 10 and disposed opposite the base plate 24. The cover plate 66 may at least partially enclose or substantially fully enclose the cooling cassette 10. The cover plate 66 may exist as a plurality of layers to further assist in insulating the cooling section 58 from the heating section 56. The cover plate 66 may include a frame 68. The frame 68 may be produced from a metal or a plastic. The frame 68 may outline the different sections of the cooling cassette 10. For instance, openings 74 generally are associated with the heating section 56 of the cooling cassette 10. The frame 68 may insulate the cooling section 58 and the heating section 56 and thereby avoid a thermal bridge between the sections. Opening 76 is generally associated with the controls 36 of the cooling cassette 10. Openings 78 and 80 are generally associated with the return chamber 38 and supply chamber 40, respectively, of the receptacle 46 in the cooling section 58 of the cooling cassette 10. As such, the openings 78 and 80 of the cover plate 66 may promote air flow between the cooling cassette 10 and a refrigerated cabinet operatively associated with the cooling cassette 10. The cover plate 66 may also include a heating section enclosure 70 to further insulate the heating section 56. The heating section enclosure 70 may at least partially or substantially fully enclose the heating section 56. The heating section enclosure 70 is generally produced from a metal. The cover plate 66 may also include a controls enclosure 72 for further insulating the controls 36. The controls enclosure 70 may at least partially or fully enclose the controls 36. The controls enclosure 72 may be produced from a metal or a plastic. The frame 68 and enclosures 70 and 72 may be attached to and/or associated with one another in order to provide a cover plate 66 for the housing 86 of the cooling cassette 10. According to one embodiment, the cooling cassette 10 may be utilized in a refrigerated merchandiser 100. An exemplary embodiment of a refrigerated merchandiser 100 utilizing the cooling cassette 10 in one embodiment is shown schematically in FIG. 7 for example. The refrigerated merchandiser 100 includes a refrigerated display cabinet 102 and a compartment 104. The refrigerated display cabinet 102 is defined by a top wall 120, a base 128 disposed vertically opposite the top wall 120, at least two side walls 122, and a rear wall 118 extending between and connecting the top wall 120, the base 128, and the side walls 122. The top wall 120, the base 128, the side walls 122, and the rear wall 118 define an interior space 106. The cabinet 102 may also include an inner rear panel 124. The inner rear panel 124 may be spaced from the rear wall 118 of the cabinet 102 and extend along the height of the interior space 106 of the refrigerated cabinet 102 from the base 128 of the cabinet 102 toward the top wall 120 such that there optionally may be a gap 132 between the top wail 120 and an edge, such as the top edge, of the inner rear panel 124. The inner rear panel 124 may extend at least 50%, such as at least 60%, such as at least 70%, such as at least 80% and generally less than about 100% of the interior height of the interior space 106 of the cabinet 102. The inner real panel 124 may also contain openings 130 for allowing air to enter the interior space 106 of the cabinet 102 at various vertical height(s) of the cabinet 102. The space between the rear wall 118 and the inner rear panel 124 defines a vertically extended air passageway 126 for supplying cooled air to the interior space 106 of the cabinet 102. In addition, the base 128 separates the cabinet 102 and the compartment 104 located beneath. In addition, the walls of the cabinet 102 may be insulated using any method known in the art. For instance, the walls of the cabinet 102 may be insulated with an insulating material, such as a polystyrene. The interior space 106 may house at least one shelf 108 that is disposed to carry containers 110, such as bottles or cans. It should be understood that the containers 110 can be any objects desired to be stored and/or cooled. In general, the interior space 106 may contain at least 3 shelves, such as at least 4 shelves, such as at least 5 shelves but generally less than 10 shelves, such as less than 7 shelves, such as less than 6 shelves. The cabinet 102 may also have a door 112 such as a glass door. The door 112 when opened allows a consumer to access the interior space 106 of the cabinet 102. The door 112 may also contain a peripheral seal (not shown) to keep the interior space 106 of the cabinet 102 substantially airtight. Also, it is to be understood that the merchandiser 100 may have more than one door 112. In addition, the cooling cassette 10 may also be utilized with refrigerated merchandisers 100 that do not provide a door 112. These merchandisers 100 are generally referred to as open-access merchandisers providing a consumer with immediate access to the contents stored therein. As schematically shown in FIG. 7 and FIG. 10 for example, the compartment 104 is located at the base of the merchandiser 100 and beneath the base 128 of the cabinet 102. The compartment 104 at the base of the refrigerated merchandiser 100 is configured to receive the cooling cassette 10. The cooling cassette 10 may be slidably inserted into or withdrawn from, as the case may be, the compartment 104 beneath cabinet 102 to facilitate servicing and repair of the components comprising the cassette 10. When inserting the cooling cassette 10 into the compartment 104, a handle 60 on the front panel 20 of the cooling cassette 10 may be utilized to position the cassette 10. Once inserted into the compartment 104, any method known in the art such as levers can be utilized to raise the cassette 10 and lock it into its operative position within the compartment 104. The cooling cassette 10 can then be raised so that the cooling cassette 10 is in contact with the bottom surface of the base 128 of the cabinet 102. In particular, the return chamber 38 and supply chamber 40 of the cooling cassette 10 will be substantially aligned with an air return opening 114 and an air supply opening 116, respectively in the base 128 of the cabinet 102. The air return opening 114 and/or the air supply opening 116 may be covered with a screen or a grille (not shown) to prevent items from falling into the return chamber 38 or the supply chamber 40, respectively. As such, the cabinet 102 and the cooling cassette 10 are operatively associated for circulating air. The cooling cassette 10 may also be placed into a sealing relationship with the base 128 of the cabinet 102. Thus, a sealing member (not shown), which may include one or more compressible or non-compressible seals, may be mounted to the bottom surface of the base 128 of the cabinet 102 or may be mounted to the top surface of the frame 68 of the cover plate 66 of the cooling cassette 10. In particular, the sealing system may outline the return chamber 38 and the supply chamber 40 of the receptacle 46 of the cooling section 58. The sealing system is configured and disposed to provide an airtight seal and prevent undesired heat exchange which reduces the cooling efficiencies. In particular, the sealing system is configured and disposed to prevent air drawn to the cooling cassette 10 through air return opening 114 and return chamber 38 from bypassing the evaporator 32 and instead flowing directly to the supply chamber 40 and air supply opening 116. In addition, the sealing system is configured and disposed to prevent air drawn to the cooling cassette 10 through air return opening 114 and return chamber 38 from escaping to the ambient or the heating section 56 of the cooling cassette 10. Similarly, the sealing system is also configured and disposed to prevent ambient air or air from the heating section 56 from being drawn into the cooling section 58 through the cooling cassette 10. In addition, a faceplate/front grille 134 may be in front of the cooling cassette so as to hide or cover the cassette from the view of a consumer. The airflow path through the refrigerated merchandiser 100 and cooling cassette 10 is also schematically shown in FIG. 7. Generally, the evaporator fan 34 of the cooling cassette 10 is utilized to circulate air within the refrigerated display cabinet 102 and the cooling section 58 of the cooling cassette 10. Air is drawn from the interior space 106 of the cabinet 102 into the cooling cassette 10 through air return opening 114 and return chamber 38 in an air return stream, represented by the arrow designated A. The evaporator fan 34, located upstream with respect to the evaporator 32, draws the air into the evaporator 32. Heat transfer occurs between the air in the evaporator 32 and the refrigerant circulating within the evaporator 32 coils of the cooling cassette 10. Subsequently, the air is cooled and leaves the evaporator 32 through supply chamber 40 and air supply opening 116 in an air supply stream, represented by the arrow designated B. The cooled air enters the air passageway 126 between the rear wall 118 and the inner rear panel 124 of the cabinet 102. The cooled air is drawn upwardly, represented by the arrow designated C, through the air passageway 126. The cooled air may enter the interior space 106 of the refrigerated cabinet 102 through openings 130 formed in the inner rear panel 124, represented by the arrow designated D. The cooled air may also enter the interior space 106 of the cabinet 102 through a gap 132 between the top wall 120 and an edge of the inner rear panel 124, represented by the arrow designated E. The cooled air is then discharged into the interior space 106 of the cabinet 102 and utilized to cool the containers 110 housed within the interior space 106. After the air flows through the interior space 106 of the cabinet 102, represented by the arrow designated F, it is then drawn back to the evaporator fan 34 and evaporator 32 through the air return opening 114 located in the base 128 of the cabinet 102 and the return chamber 38 of the cooling cassette 10. While the cooling operation occurs, the process continues until the cabinet temperature reaches a desired temperature. In addition, the cooling cassette 10 operates in a conventional manner. Initially, the compressor 26, the condenser 28, and the evaporator 32 are operatively connected to form a closed circuit using refrigerant lines (not shown) for circulating a refrigerant. In particular, the compressor 26 circulates a refrigerant through the condenser 28 and the evaporator 32. The compressor 26 is utilized to compress the refrigerant into a heated, high pressure vapor. The refrigerant then enters the condenser 28. As air is drawn through the condenser 28 using the condenser fan 30, the refrigerant condenses into a liquid phase by releasing heat to the air surrounding the condenser coils 28. Thereafter, the refrigerant line may also include an expansion valve (not shown) that causes the liquid refrigerant to expand and vaporize. Then, the refrigerant enters the evaporator 32. As air from the interior space 106 of the cabinet 102 is drawn into the evaporator 32 using an evaporator fan 34, the refrigerant vaporizes by absorbing heat from the air surrounding the evaporator coils 32. In the evaporator 32, the air is cooled and returned back to the interior space 106 of the refrigerated display cabinet 102. Thereafter, the refrigerant is transferred to the compressor 26 and compressed in the compressor 26 to a heated, high pressure vapor and the process continues until the cabinet temperature reaches a desired temperature. Referring to FIGS. 1-3 and 7, the housing 86 of the cooling cassette 10 may also house the controls 36 for regulating the cooling cassette 10 and the refrigerated cabinet 102 operatively associated with the cooling cassette 10. The controls 36 may be mounted to the controls panel 20a of front panel 20. The controls 36 may contain a thermostat, a power switch, and an electrical connection 90 for providing power to the cooling cassette 10, and the controls 36 may also include additional controls known to those skilled in the art. The thermostat monitors the temperature of the air within the interior space 106 of the refrigerated display cabinet 102 and activates the compressor 26 when the temperature of the air reaches a first pre-determined set point. The condenser fan 30 and the evaporator fan 34 are activated at the same time as the compressor 26. Typically, the compressor 26 continues operating and circulating refrigerant until the temperature of the air in the interior space 106 of the cabinet 102 reaches a second pre-determined set point. Additionally, the evaporator fan 34 may operate or work intermittently when the compressor 26 is not operating or is in an off-period, based upon the cooling requirements and the need to optimize energy. When the air reaches a second pre-determined set point, the compressor 26, the condenser fan 30, and the evaporator fan 34 stop operating until the air once again reaches the first pre-determined set point. The cooling cassette 10 provides many advantages over current modular systems. For instance, by configuring the components of the cooling cassette 10 and in particular by utilizing the receptacle 46 in the cooling section 58, the cooling cassette 10 provides a more compact design. In particular, the cooling cassette 10 provides a more compact design than current modular systems used for similarly sized merchandisers. For instance, the cooling cassette 10 has a more compact design than current modular systems typically used for refrigerated merchandisers that are from about 100 cm to about 200 cm, such as from about 125 cm to about 175 cm, such as from about 135 cm to about 160 cm in height in the vertical direction. Because of the performance and energy requirements and the size of the components necessary to meet such requirements, current modular systems have a height of at least about 27.9 cm (11 inches), such as at least about 30.5 cm (12 inches), such as at least about 31.75 cm (12.5 inches). On the other hand, the cooling cassette 10 has a height of from about 20.3 cm (8 inches) to 25.4 cm (10 inches), such as from about 21.6 cm (8.5 inches) to 25.4 cm (10 inches), such as from about 22.9 cm (9 inches) to 25.4 cm (10 inches), such as about 24.1 cm (9.5 inches). In addition, the cooling cassette 10 has a height as mentioned above in conjunction with an internal volume of less than about 0.082 m3 (5000 in3), such as less than about 0.080 m3 (4900 in3), such as less than about 0.078 m3 (4750 in3), such as less than about 0.075 m3 (4600 in3) but generally greater than about 0.057 m3 (3500 in3), such as greater than about 0.066 m3 (4000 in3). On the other hand, current modular systems with a height of at least about 30.5 cm (12.5 inches) have an internal volume of greater than about 0.082 m3 (5000 in3) such as greater than about 0.091 m3 (5500 in3). In addition, even though the cooling cassette 10 is more compact, it still meets the necessary performance and cooling requirements for conventional refrigerated merchandisers 100. For example, the cooling cassette 10 can be utilized in a conventional refrigerated merchandiser, such as those found in retail establishments, comprising 3, 4, 5, or 6 shelves containing beverages such as 20 ounce bottles. While current modular systems may be able to meet these performance and cooling requirements, they do not provide a compact design and their size comes at the expense of valuable storage and cooling space within the refrigerated cabinet 102. As such, because the cooling cassette 10 has a more compact size, it also permits a reduction in volume allocated for the operating refrigeration components. Consequently, the cooling cassette 10 provides more usable cooling space within the interior space 106 of a refrigerated cabinet 102 of a refrigerated merchandiser 100. The cooling cassette 10 allows for an increase in usable cooling space 106 without requiring a change in the overall height of the merchandiser 100. Therefore, conventional refrigerated merchandisers can be fitted to incorporate an additional shelf when using the cooling cassette 10. While the interior space of a refrigerated merchandiser 100 comprising a current modular system may only contain 3 shelves for storing products such as 20 ounce bottles, a refrigerated merchandiser 100 of the same size can be fitted to accommodate the cooling cassette 10 and provide an interior space 106 that may contain 4 shelves of 20 ounce bottles. Therefore, the cooling cassette 10 provides more usable storage and cooling space. In addition, the cooling cassette 10 provides the necessary performance and cooling requirements without having to increase the width of the cooling cassette 10. In particular, the width of the cooling cassette 10 is determined by the width of conventional refrigerated merchandisers 100. As such, the cooling cassette 10 has a configuration that positions the cooling section 58 adjacent the heating section 56 within the width constraints without having to at least partially overlap the cooling section 58 and the heating section 56. As such, the cooling cassette 10 is configured in a manner that one would not expect. Another advantage of utilizing the cooling cassette 10 is the increase in energy efficiency. Because the cooling cassette 10 is more compact with a reduction in volume and height compared to current modular systems, the cooling cassette 10 is more energy efficient and requires less electricity. By reducing the height and volume of the cooling cassette 10, the smaller cooling envelope results in a reduction in energy or cooling losses, In addition, the reduction in size also provides less surface area to radiate heat and contact with the cooled air. Another advantage of utilizing the cooling cassette 10 is that the cassette 10 can be preassembled separately from the refrigerated display cabinet 102. Consequently, this allows for flexibility in combining the cassette 10 and cabinet 102 to produce the refrigerated merchandiser 100. The cassette 10 can be placed into the compartment 104 of the merchandiser 100 requiring only the steps of connecting the electrical power, control electronics, and optionally, conduits for draining before the merchandiser 100 is operational. For instance, as shown in FIG. 1, a simple plug and socket connection 90 allows for easy removal and these connections can be utilized for the electrical power and control electronics. Another advantage is that when a component of the cooling cassette 10 fails, the cooling cassette 10 can be removed without requiring removal of the entire merchandiser 100. In addition, instead of placing the merchandiser 100 out of service, a replacement cassette 10 can be inserted into the compartment 104 while the malfunctioning unit is repaired. This allows for flexibility in servicing the malfunctioning cassette offsite while still providing the operator with a functional merchandiser. Furthermore, when a component of the cassette 10 malfunctions, the panel adjacent the malfunctioning component can be easily removed and reattached in order to conduct the necessary repairs.
