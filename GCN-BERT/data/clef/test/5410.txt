FABRIC CARE COMPOSITIONS COMPRISING POLYURETHANE, POLYUREA AND/OR POLYURETHANEUREA POLYMERS FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure relates to compositions and systems comprising fit retention polymers and methods of making and using the same. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION When fabrics such as garments are worn, such fabric may lose their shape due to stresses and strains on the garment fibers that occur, for example, due to everyday movements by the wearer. As a result, the "fit" of the garment is lost and the garment's appearance as well as comfort is lost. In order to alleviate this problem, fibers such a spandex (elastane) are incorporated into certain garments and/or garment weaves may be altered. Unfortunately, such solutions typically increase the cost of a garment and must be done at a textile mill when the fabric that is used in such garment is made. Thus, if such a solution is not implemented from the start, such "fit" issue cannot addressed subsequently. So, what is needed is a solution to the "fit" problem that can implemented at any time during a fabric's life. Applicants provide such a solution herein. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure relates to compositions and systems comprising fit retention polymers and methods of making and using the same. Methods of using such compositions including contacting a fabric with the fabric care composition are also disclosed. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As used herein, the articles "a" and "an" when used in a claim, are understood to mean one or more of what is claimed or described. As used herein, the term "comprising" means various components conjointly employed in the preparation of the compositions of the present disclosure. Accordingly, the terms "consisting essentially of and "consisting of are embodied in the term "comprising." As used herein, "fabric care compositions" include compositions for handwash, machine wash, additive compositions, compositions suitable for use in the soaking and/or pretreatment of stained fabrics, rinse-added compositions, sprays and ironing aids. The fabric care compositions may take the form of, for example, liquid and granule laundry detergents, fabric conditioners, other wash, rinse, dryer-added products such as sheet, and sprays, encapsulated and/or unitized dose compositions, ironing aids, fabric sprays for use on dry fabrics, or as compositions that comprise two or more separate phases that are dispensed together. Fabric care compositions in the liquid form are generally in an aqueous carrier, and generally have a viscosity from about 1 to about 2000 centipoise (1-2000 mPa*s), or from about 200 to about 800 centipoises (200-800 mPa*s). Viscosity can be determined by conventional methods readily known in the art. The term also encompasses low-water or concentrated formulations such as those containing less than about 50% or less than about 30% or less than about 20% water or other carrier. As used herein, the term "substituted" means the replacement of -H with a chemically acceptable moiety, for example a hydroxyl, an amine, an aromatic, an alkoxy, a carboxylate, a phosphate, or a sulphate. As used herein, the terms "include," "includes," and "including" are meant to be non-limiting. Unless otherwise noted, all component or composition levels are in reference to the active portion of that component or composition, and are exclusive of impurities, for example, residual solvents or by-products, which may be present in commercially available sources of such components or compositions. It should be understood that every maximum numerical limitation given throughout this specification includes every lower numerical limitation, as if such lower numerical limitations were expressly written herein. Every minimum numerical limitation given throughout this specification will include every higher numerical limitation, as if such higher numerical limitations were expressly written herein. Every numerical range given throughout this specification will include every narrower numerical range that falls within such broader numerical range, as if such narrower numerical ranges were all expressly written herein. Form of composition. The composition can be any liquid form, for example a liquid or gel form, or any combination thereof. The composition may be in any unit dose form, for example a pouch.

Surfactancy boosting polymer. The composition may comprise a surfactancy boosting polymer. Preferred polymers are amphiphilic alkoxylated grease cleaning polymers and/or random graft co-polymers. These polymers are described in more detail below. Amphiphilic alkoxylated grease cleaning polymer. Amphiphilic alkoxylated grease cleaning polymers refer to any alkoxylated polymers having balanced hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties such that they remove grease particles from fabrics and surfaces. Specific embodiments of the amphiphilic alkoxylated grease cleaning polymers of the present invention comprise a core structure and a plurality of alkoxylate groups attached to that core structure. The core structure may comprise a polyalkylenimine structure comprising, in condensed form, repeating units of formulae (I), (II), (III) and (IV): (I) (I I) (i l l) (IV) wherein # in each case denotes one-half of a bond between a nitrogen atom and the free binding position of a group A1 of two adjacent repeating units of formulae (I), (II), (III) or (IV); * in each case denotes one-half of a bond to one of the alkoxylate groups; and A1 is independently selected from linear or branched C2-C6-alkylene; wherein the polyalkylenimine structure consists of 1 repeating unit of formula (I), x repeating units of formula (II), y repeating units of formula (III) and y+1 repeating units of formula (IV), wherein x and y in each case have a value in the range of from 0 to about 150; where the average weight average molecular weight, Mw, of the polyalkylenimine core structure is a value in the range of from about 60 to about 10,000 g/mol. The core structure may alternatively comprise a polyalkanolamine structure of the condensation products of at least one compound selected from N-(hydroxyalkyl)amines of formulae (La) and/or (Lb), wherein A are independently selected from Ci-C6-alk lene; R1, R1*, R2, R2*, R3, R3*, R4, R4*, R5 and R5* are independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl, wherein the last three mentioned radicals may be optionally substituted; and R6 is selected from hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl or aryl, wherein the last three mentioned radicals may be optionally substituted. The plurality of alkylenoxy groups attached to the core structure are independently selected from alkylenoxy units of the formula (V) A-04d-CH2-CH2-04drA3-°- -R (V) wherein * in each case denotes one-half of a bond to the nitrogen atom of the repeating unit of formula (I), (II) or (IV); A is in each case independently selected from 1,2-propylene, 1,2- butylene and 1,2-isobutylene; A is 1,2-propylene; R is in each case independently selected from hydrogen and C1-C4-alkyl; m has an average value in the range of from 0 to about 2; n has an average value in the range of from about 20 to about 50; and p has an average value in the range of from about 10 to about 50. Specific embodiments of the amphiphilic alkoxylated grease cleaning polymers may be selected from alkoxylated polyalkylenimines having an inner polyethylene oxide block and an outer polypropylene oxide block, the degree of ethoxylation and the degree of propoxylation not going above or below specific limiting values. Specific embodiments of the alkoxylated polyalkylenimines according to the present invention have a minimum ratio of polyethylene blocks to polypropylene blocks (n/p) of about 0.6 and a maximum of about 1.5(x+2y+l) 1/2. Alkoxykated polyalkyenimines having an n/p ratio of from about 0.8 to about 1.2(x+2y+l) 1/2 have been found to have especially beneficial properties. The alkoxylated polyalkylenimines according to the present invention have a backbone which consists of primary, secondary and tertiary amine nitrogen atoms which are attached to one another by alkylene radicals A and are randomly arranged. Primary amino moieties which start or terminate the main chain and the side chains of the polyalkylenimine backbone and whose remaining hydrogen atoms are subsequently replaced by alkylenoxy units are referred to as repeating units of formulae (I) or (IV), respectively. Secondary amino moieties whose remaining hydrogen atom is subsequently replaced by alkylenoxy units are referred to as repeating units of formula (II). Tertiary amino moieties which branch the main chain and the side chains are referred to as repeating units of formula (III). Since cyclization can occur in the formation of the polyalkylenimine backbone, it is also possible for cyclic amino moieties to be present to a small extent in the backbone. Such polyalkylenimines containing cyclic amino moieties are of course alkoxylated in the same way as those consisting of the noncyclic primary and secondary amino moieties. The polyalkylenimine backbone consisting of the nitrogen atoms and the groups A1, has an average molecular weight Mw of from about 60 to about 10,000 g/mole, preferably from about 100 to about 8,000 g/mole and more preferably from about 500 to about 6,000 g/mole. The sum (x+2y+l) corresponds to the total number of alkylenimine units present in one individual polyalkylenimine backbone and thus is directly related to the molecular weight of the polyalkylenimine backbone. The values given in the specification however relate to the number average of all polyalkylenimines present in the mixture. The sum (x+2y+2) corresponds to the total number amino groups present in one individual polyalkylenimine backbone. The radicals A1 connecting the amino nitrogen atoms may be identical or different, linear or branched C2-C6-alkylene radicals, such as 1,2-ethylene, 1,2-propylene, 1,2-butylene, 1,2- isobutylene,l,2-pentanediyl, 1,2-hexanediyl or hexamethylen. A preferred branched alkylene is 1,2-propylene. Preferred linear alkylene are ethylene and hexamethylene. A more preferred alkylene is 1,2-ethylene. The hydrogen atoms of the primary and secondary amino groups of the polyalkylenimine backbone are replaced by alkylenoxy units of the formula (V). ~A-o^fCH2-CH2-o ^fA3-°^R (V) In this formula, the variables preferably have one of the meanings given below: A in each case is selected from 1,2-propylene, 1,2-butylene and 1,2-isobutylene; preferably A 2 is 1,2-propylene. A 3 is 1,2-propylene; R in each case is selected from hydrogen and Ci-C4-alkyl, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl and tert.-butyl; preferably R is hydrogen. The index m in each case has a value of 0 to about 2; preferably m is 0 or approximately 1; more preferably m is 0. The index n has an average value in the range of from about 20 to about 50, preferably in the range of from about 22 to about 40, and more preferably in the range of from about 24 to about 30. The index p has an average value in the range of from about 10 to about 50, preferably in the range of from about 11 to about 40, and more preferably in the range of from about 12 to about 30. Preferably the alkylenoxy unit of formula (V) is a non-random sequence of alkoxylate blocks. By non-random sequence it is meant that the [-A -0-]m is added first (i.e., closest to the bond to the nitrogen atom of the repeating unit of formula (I), (II), or (III)), the [- CH2-CH2-0-]n is added second, and the [-A -0-]p is added third. This orientation provides the alkoxylated polyalkylenimine with an inner polyethylene oxide block and an outer polypropylene oxide block. The substantial part of these alkylenoxy units of formula (V) is formed by the ethylenoxy units -[CH2-CH2-0)]n- and the propylenoxy units -[CH2-CH2(CH3)-0]p-. The alkylenoxy units may additionally also have a small proportion of propylenoxy or butylenoxy units -[A -0]m-, i.e. the polyalkylenimine backbone saturated with hydrogen atoms may be reacted initially with small amounts of up to about 2 mol, especially from about 0.5 to about 1.5 mol, in particular from about 0.8 to about 1.2 mol, of propylene oxide or butylene oxide per mole of NH- moieties present, i.e. incipiently alkoxylated. This initial modification of the polyalkylenimine backbone allows, if necessary, the viscosity of the reaction mixture in the alkoxylation to be lowered. However, the modification generally does not influence the performance properties of the alkoxylated polyalkylenimine and therefore does not constitute a preferred measure. The amphiphilic alkoxylated grease cleaning polymers are present in the detergent and cleaning compositions of the present invention at levels ranging from about 0.05% to 10% by weight of the composition. Embodiments of the compositions may comprise from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight. More specifically, the embodiments may comprise from about 0.25 to about 2.5% of the grease cleaning polymer.

The Recovery Index is measured using a Tensile and Compression Tester Instrument, such as the Instron Model 5565 (Instron Corp., Norwood, Massachusetts, U.S.A.). The instrument is configured by selecting the following settings: the mode is Tensile Extension; the Waveform Shape is Triangle; the Maximum Strain is 10%, the Rate is 0.83mm/sec, the number of Cycles is 4; and the Hold time is 15 seconds between cycles. 1) Determine the weight of one approximately 25.4cm square swatch of 100% cotton woven fabric, (a suitable fabric is the Mercerized Combed Cotton Warp Sateen, Product Code 479, available from Testfabrics Inc., West Pittston, PA, USA). 2) Determine the amount of organo siloxane polymer required to deposit 5mg of the polymer per gram of fabric swatch and weigh that amount into a 50ml plastic centrifuge tube with a lid. 3) Dilute the organo siloxane polymer to 1.3 times the weight of the swatch with a solvent that completely dissolves or disperses the organo siloxane polymer (examples: isopropyl alcohol, THF, Ν,Ν-dimethylacetamide, water). ) Thoroughly disperse or dissolve silicone polyurethaneurea with shaking or vortex stirring as needed. ) Place fabric swatch lying flat into a stainless steel tray that is larger than the swatch.) Pour the organo siloxane polymer solution over the entire swatch as evenly as possible.) Fold the swatch twice to quarter, then roll it up while gently squeezing to disperse solution to the entire swatch. ) Unfold and repeat Step 7, folding in the opposite direction ) To make a control swatch, repeat the procedure described above using 1.3X weight of solvent only (nil active). 0) Lay each swatch on a separate piece of aluminum foil and place in a fume hood to dry overnight. 1) Cure each swatch in an oven with appropriate ventilation at 90 °C for 5 minutes, (a suitable oven is the Mathis Labdryer, with 1500 rpm fan rotation) (Werner Mathis AG, Oberhasli, Switzerland). 2) Condition fabrics in a constant temperature (21°C +/- 2 °C) and humidity (50% RH +/- 5% RH) room for at least 6 hours. 3) With scissors, cut the edge of one entire side of each swatch in the warp direction and carefully remove fabric threads one at a time without stressing the fabric until an even edge is achieved. 4) Cut 4 strips of fabric from each swatch (die or rotary cut), parallel to the even edge, that are 2.54 cm wide and at least 10 cm long 5) Evenly clamp the top and bottom (narrower edges) of the fabric strip into the 2.54cm grips on the tensile tester instrument with a 2.54 cm gap setting, loading a small amount of force (0.1N - 0.2N) on the sample. 6) Strain to 10% at 0.83 mm/s and return to 2.54 cm gap at the same rate. 7) Release bottom clamp and re-clamp sample during the hold cycle, loading 0.1N-0.2N of force on the sample. 8) Repeat Steps 15-16 until 4 hysteresis cycles have been completed for the sample. 9) Analyze 4 fabric samples per treatment swatch by the above method and average the tensile strain values recorded at 0.1N unload for Cycle 4. Recovery is calculated as follows: % Recovery = (10-Tensile Strain at 0.1N) 10 20) Recovery Index = % Recovery of Treatment % Recovery of Control EXAMPLES The following non-limiting examples are illustrative. Percentages are by weight unless otherwise specified. While particular aspects have been illustrated and described, other changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
