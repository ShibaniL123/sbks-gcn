Example 25: Synthesis of compound 11164, N-phenyl-1-(2,2,2-trifluoroacetyl)-N-(4-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzyl)piperidine-4-carboxamide
N-phenyl-N-(4-(5-(trifluoromethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzyl)piperidine-4-carboxamide hydrochloride (0.080 g, 0.171 mmol), synthesized in Example 11, and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.059 mL, 0.343 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (10 mL) at room temperature, and 2,2,2-trifluoroacetic anhydride (0.027 mL, 0.188 mmol) was added to the solution, followed by stirring at the same temperature for 18 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 4 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 0% to 50%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.061 g, 67.6%) as colorless oil.
