CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/641,364 filed on May 2, 2012, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure is concerned with certain triazolopyridazine compounds that are capable of inhibiting certain protein kinases, and especially the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) protein. Compounds of the present disclosure can be used to treat a number of disorders caused by or associated with abnormal LRRK2 kinase activity. Compounds of the present disclosure can be used to treat disorders including neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease; precancerous conditions and cancer; autoimmune disorders such as Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis; and leprosy (Hansen's disease). BACKGROUND ART The LRRK2 gene encodes a protein kinase and it has been disclosed that missense mutations in this gene can lead to a number of diseases such as various neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease. Additionally, LRRK2 is genetically linked to precancerous conditions and cancer; autoimmune disorders such as Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis; and leprosy. For instance, it has been suggested that certain mutations in LRRK2 can lead to Parkinson's disease through the up-regulation of the kinase activity of the protein kinase. It is suspected that this protein kinase may be over-active in Parkinson's disease. There has been much interest raised by the recent discovery that different autosomal dominant point mutations within the gene encoding for LRRK2 predispose humans to develop late-onset Parkinson's disease (OMIM accession number 609007), with a clinical appearance indistinguishable from idiopathic Parkinson's disease. See Paisan-Ruiz et al. (2004), “Cloning of the gene containing mutations that cause PARK 8-linked Parkinson's disease.” Neuron. 44, 595-600; Mata et al. (2006), “LRRK2 in Parkinson's disease: protein domains and functional insights.” Trends Neurosci. 29, 286-293; Taylor et al. (2006), “LRRK2: a common pathway for Parkinsonism, pathogenesis and prevention?” Trends Mol. Med. 12, 76-82. The genetic analysis undertaken to date indicates that mutations in LRRK2 are relatively frequent, not only accounting for 5-10% of familial Parkinson's disease, but also being found in a significant proportion of sporadic Parkinson's disease cases. See Farrer et al. (2005), “LRRK2 mutations in Parkinson disease.” Neurology 65, 738-740; and Zabetian et al. (2005), “A clinic-based study of the LRRK2 gene in Parkinson disease yields new mutations.” Neurology 65, 741-744. Little is known about how LRRK2 is regulated in cells, what its physiological substrates are and how mutations cause or increase risk of Parkinson's disease. The domain structure of LRRK2 is depicted in WO 2011/141756 A1, disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. See FIG. 1 therein, which also shows mutations which have been reported in patients with Parkinson's disease. The defining feature of the LRRK2 enzyme is a leucine rich repeat (LRR) motif (residues 1010-1291), a Ras-like small GTPase (residues 1336-1510), a region of high amino acid conservation that has been termed the C-terminal of Ras complex (COR) domain (residues 1511-1878), a protein kinase catalytic domain (residues 1879-2132) and a C-terminal VVD40 motif (2231-2276). See Bosgraaf et al. (2003), “Roc, a Ras/GTPase domain in complex proteins.” Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1643, 5-10; and Marin (2006), “The Parkinson disease gene LRRK2: evolutionary and structural insights.” Mol. Biol. Evol. 23, 2423-2433. The protein kinase domain of LRRK2 belongs to the tyrosine-like serine threonine protein kinases and is most similar to the kinase RIP (Receptor Interacting Protein), which play key roles in innate immunity signaling pathways. See Manning et al. (2002), “The protein kinase complement of the human genome.” Science 298, 1912-1934. Almost 40 single amino acid substitution mutations have been linked to autosomal-dominant Parkinson's disease. Mata et al., supra; Taylor et al., supra; WO 2011/141756 A1. It has also been reported that the most prevalent mutant form of LRRK2 accounting for approximately 6% of familial Parkinson's disease and 3% of sporadic Parkinson's disease cases in Europe, comprises an amino acid substitution of Gly2019 to a Ser residue. Gly2019 is located within the conserved DYG-Mg′-binding motif, in subdomain-VII of the kinase domain. Mata et al., supra. More recent reports suggest that this mutation enhances the autophosphorylation of LRRK2, as well as its ability to phosphorylate myelin basic protein 2-3-fold. West et al. (2005), “Parkinson's disease-associated mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 augment kinase activity.” Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 102, 16842-16847; and Greggio et al. (2006), “Kinase activity is required for the toxic effects of mutant LRRK2ldardarin.” Neurobiol. Dis. 23, 329-341. These observations suggest that over-activation of LRRK2 predisposes humans to develop some forms of Parkinson's disease. As discussed in “Chromosomal amplification of leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2) is required for oncogenic MET signaling in papillary renal and thyroid carcinomas”, Looyeng et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (2011), 108(4), 1439-1444, S1439/1-S1439/10; language: English; database: CAPLUS, DOI:10.1073/pnas.1012500108; the receptor tyrosine kinase MET is frequently amplified in human tumors, resulting in high cell surface densities and constitutive activation even in the absence of growth factor stimulation by its endogenous ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). LRRK2 was identified and shown to be amplified and overexpressed in papillary renal and thyroid carcinomas. Down-regulation of LRRK2 in cultured tumor cells compromises MET activation and selectively reduces downstream MET signaling to mTOR and STAT3. Loss of these critical mitogenic pathways induces cell cycle arrest and cell death due to loss of ATP production, indicating that MET and LRRK2 cooperate to promote efficient tumor cell growth and survival in these cancers. Missense mutations in LRRK2, as discussed above cause late-onset Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, common genetic variation in LRRK2 modifies susceptibility to Crohn's disease and leprosy. See “LRRK2 inhibition attenuates microglial inflammatory responses”, Moehle et al., Journal of Neuroscience (2012), 32(5), 1602-1611. Language: English, Database: CAPLUS, DOI:10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5601-11.2012. Included among the genes identified as being associated with leprosy susceptibility or resistance, PARK2 and LRRK2 have been discussed as participating in the regulation of host-cell apoptosis. See “Leprosy susceptibility: genetic variations regulate innate and adaptive immunity, and disease outcome,” Cardoso et al., Future Microbiology (2011), 6(5), 533-549. Cardoso et al. further report that the same genes associated with leprosy are also associated with autoimmune (Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis) or neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson's and Alzheimer's).

1-(azetidin-1-yl)-2-((3-(thiazol-2-yl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazin-6-yl)thio)propan-1-one Synthesis Compounds according to the present disclosure can, for example, be prepared by the methods outlined below. A practitioner skilled in the art will understand the appropriate use of protecting groups [see: Greene and Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis] and the preparation of known compounds found in the literature using the standard methods of organic synthesis. There may come from time to time the need to rearrange the order of the recommended synthetic steps, however this will be apparent to the judgment of a chemist skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Compounds of formula I found in this disclosure can be prepared by a variety of methods; one example is illustrated in Scheme I for compounds where X═—C(R3R4)C(O)OH, —C(R3R4)C(O)OR5, —C(R3R4)C(O)NR6R7, —C(R3R4)C(O)NHR6 or —C(R3R4)C(O)NH2. Commercially available 3-chloro-5-thiopyridazine [or an analog with substituted R1 or R2] is alkylated with a 1-chloroacetic acid ester analog which may be substituted at R3 and R4 using a variety of bases (Na2CO3, NaOH, Et3N) in solvents such as DMF, acetone, butanone, THF, EtOH and the like at a temperature range of −10° C. to reflux temperature. Transfromation of the resulting alkylation product to the triazolopyridazine can be managed by heating up to reflux temperature in an alcohol solvent such as butanol or ethanol a mixture of the chloropyridazine with an acylhydrazide substituted with the required group Z as described in formula I. This results in a concomitant N-alkylation of the chloropyridazine followed by a cyclocondensation to the triazolopyridazine product. Scheme II illustrates an alternative approach where the order of the first three steps is interchanged from the order described in Scheme I. This method leads to the synthesis of the 6-chlorotriazolopyridazine which is a convenient intermediate for the preparation of a variety of analogs [Scheme III]. The 6-chlorotriazolopyridazine intermediate serves as a starting point for compounds where the thioether linkage is replaced by an ether linkage or an amine. The sodium salt of a hydroxyacetic acid ester analog prepared from NaH in dry DMF is stirred with cooling until the starting material is consumed. The resulting product is an —O— linked ester which can be hydrolyzed to the acid and coupled with an amine to give amides as described in Schemata I and II. Elaboration of 6-chlorotriazolopyridazine to an amine linked compound can best be realized by treating the chloro compound with neat distilled, liquid ammonia in a pressure bomb at high temperature and pressure until all of the 6-chlorotriazolopyridazine is consumed. The resulting 6-NH2 analog is alkylated with an alpha-haloacetic acid ester analog to give an ester product which can be transformed to the acid and amide as described before. Finally metal coupling chemistry championed by Buchwald or by Chan and Lam would be useful for the direct transformation of the 6-chlorotriazolopyridazine to the N-linked esters with a judicious choice of conditions. The triazolopyridazine with an ester side chain linked to it by a —S—, —O—, —N(R3)— provides a convenient starting point for many analogs of formula I. The terminal ester can be converted to an alcohol group by a reducing agent such as lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) and the like, in an ethereal solvent such as THF, Et2O or dioxane at temperatures ranging from −78° C. to reflux temperature of the solvent. Three paths are open to the utilization of this alcohol: i) transformation into a leaving group such as a halogen (POCl3 or CCl4/Ph3P for chloro-derivatives; PBr3 or CBr4/Ph3P for bromo-derivatives etc.) or a sulfonate ester (methane sulfonyl chloride/CH2Cl2/Et3N or p-toluene sulfonyl chloride/pyridine) then displacement with an amine H2NR6, HNR6R7 (in a non-polar aprotic solvent such as DMF or DMSO, alternatively an alcoholic solvent such as EtOH or n-BuOH may be used, at temperatures ranging from 0° C. to reflux) or ammonia (liquid ammonia, pressure bomb with temperatures ranging from ambient to 200° C.); ii) the alcohol group is transformed into a leaving group as described above and subsequently displaced with a substituted or unsubstituted heterocycle (provided N remains unsubstituted) such as imidazole, pyrazole, triazoles, tetrazole, indole, indazole, benzimidazole in polar protic an aprotic solvents such as EtOH, n-BuOH, DMF or DMSO at temperatures ranging from 0° C. to the reflux temperature of the solvent, bases such as Na2CO3, KOH, Et3N or Hunigs base may be used as well; iii) the alcohol may be oxidized to an aldehydes with reagents such as PDC or PCC in dichloromethane or the Swern oxidation (dichloromethane, DMSO, oxalyl chloride, then Et3N). A practitioner skilled in art of organic chemical synthesis will recognize that the derived aldehydes are particularly useful intermediates. They may be transformed into amines by reductive amination under a variety of conditions with an amine such as NH3, H2NR6 or HNR6R7 with reagents systems such as: H2(g) and Pd—C catalyst in alcohol solvent, NaBH(OAc)3, CH2Cl2, NaBH3(CN) etc. A second use is for enolate condensation chemistry with an ester or ketone with strong hindered base such as lithium diisopropylamide in a solvent such as THF, Et2O or dioxane at temperatures ranging from −78° C. to ambient temperature. A third use is for addition by alkyl or aryl lithium or alkyl or aryl Grignard reagents or other metallated alkyl, aryl, heteroalkyl or heteroaryl species. Suitable solvents for these reactions include THF, Et2O or dioxane; reaction temperatures range from −78° C. to reflux temperature of the solvent. The commercially available ethyl 3-carboxyl-5-chloropyridazine is reacted with the appropriate acylhydrazide under conditions similar to those described previously. The resulting ethyl 6-carboxyltriazolopyridazine can be transformed to an amide by first hydrolysis of the ester functionality under basic or acidic conditions, then using methods described above, transformed to the amide with a peptide coupling reagent, a trialkyl amine base, in DMF with an appropriate amine. Reduction of the ester and oxidation of the resulting alcohol gives an aldehyde that can undergo reductive amination with an appropriate amine under the conditions described previously. The further utility of aldehydes of this type is described further in Scheme IV. Transformation of the alcohol resulting from reduction of the ester to a primary halo-compound gives an alkylating that can be used to prepare amine analogs or heteroaryl analogs and also homolgate the side chain by alkylation with a 2-alkyl acetoacetate ester with NaOEt in EtOH. The acetyl group is removed by a retroaldol in refluxing NaOEt in EtOH. The resulting acid is ready for amide formation using any of the conditions discussed previously. The primary halo-compound is also a useful intermediate for the formation of ethers using Williamson ether synthesis conditions. Scheme VI describes methodology for the homologation of the C-linked side chain by treating the primary halo-compound prepared in Scheme V with excess NaCN in DMSO or DMF at temperatures ranging from ambient to 60° C. The resulting cyano compound is hydrolyzed to the acid with hot ethanolic NaOH, then treated with ethereal diazomethane to give a methyl ester. This ester can then be alkylated with appropriate alkyl halides to give subsitutent R3 or R4 as desired. The chemist also has the option of not alkylating the ester as illustrated. In both cases the resulting esters may be transformed to various compounds of formula I using the chemistry illustrated in Schemata I through V. It is also contemplated that from time to time a set of enantiomers or diasteromers may be produced by the action of generating a chiral center(s) during synthesis. These compounds may be separated by means of chromatography, flash chromatography, HPLC or the like, with chiral columns in the case of enantiomers and sometimes diastereomers, or separated by means of crystallization or prepared enantiomerically pure by the judicious selection of synthetic methods. All of these processes are known to persons skilled in the art of organic synthesis and need not be described herein. EXPERIMENTAL Preparation of ethyl 2-((6-chloropyridazin-3-yl)thio)propanoate The synthesis of ethyl 2-((6-chloropyridazin-3-yl)thio)propanoate starts with commercially available 2-chloro-6-thiopyridazine which was added to an aqueous basic solution such as NaOH solution and the mixture was stirred for approximately 10-30 min before a solution of ethyl chloroacetate (837 mg, 7.35 mmol) in a polar solvent such as acetone was added dropwise over 10-30 min. Stirring was continued for 1-2 h, and then the reaction was allowed to stand at room temperature. The resulting solid was collected by filtration, washed with water, and then dried to give ethyl 2-((6-chloropyridazin-3-yl)thio)propanoate. Example 2 Ethyl 2-((3-(thiophen-2-yl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazin-6-yl)thio)acetate To 2-thiophenecarbohydrazide (215 mg, 1.5 mmol) dissolved in n-BuOH (3 mL) was added ethyl 2-((6-chloropyridazin-3-yl)thio)propanoate (232 mg, 1 mmol), and the whole was heated for 5 h in a 140-145° C. oil bath. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature (˜25° C.), and the solid residue removed by filtration. The filtrate was then diluted with methylene chloride (50 mL), and washed with saturated with NaHCO3 (˜15 mL). The combined aqueous layers were washed twice with methylene chloride, and the organic layers were then combined, washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated. The resulting solid was then recrystallized from EtOH to give ethyl 2-((3-(thiophen-2-yl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazin-6-yl)thio)acetate.

FABMS (M+H) calculated for C13H12N4O3S.H was 305.0702. found 305.0705. Biological Testing Compounds were assessed for inhibition of LRRK2 inhibition using the following procedure. Recombinant GST-LRRK2 (delta970), purified from baculovirus infected insect cells (SF9), at least 90% pure and either wild-type sequence or bearing the pathogenic G2019S mutation, was combined into a kinase buffer at 30 nM concentration. Kinase buffer consists of 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, and 50 μM peptide substrate (amino acid sequence RLGAWRFYTLRRARQGNTKQR). Experimental compounds or control (no compound) were added at desired concentrations in DMSO and water, where final concentration of DMSO in kinase reactions was 0.1% for all drug concentrations. Activation buffer that consists of a final concentration in the reactions of 10 mM MgCl2 and ATP (˜92 μM for WT-LRRK2 reactions and ˜52 μM for G2019S-LRRK2, which represent respective Km ATP concentrations) were added to each reaction, in addition to 0.5 μCi of gamma-32-P-dATP per reaction. Reactions were incubated at 1400 RPM at 30° C. for 30 min. and then spotted in triplicate directly onto a slot-blot apparatus fitted with phospho-cellulose paper and allowed to dry. Each slot was then washed with 10 mM phosphoric acid buffer until beta-radiation could not be detected in eluted wash buffer, usually ˜1 mL per slot. Paper within each slot were excised and radiation measured by liquid scintillation. Raw CPM were input into GraphPad, and IC-50 values calculated using non-linear regression analysis, where 100% activity is defined by reactions with control (no) inhibitor compounds, and baseline activity is defined by control reactions that did not include LRRK2 enzyme. The Table below contains the data for the compounds of the invention.

Both Example 90 and Example 34 partially inhibited levels of pS935, which demonstrates that the compounds successfully enter the cells and engage and inhibit LRRK2. Recently, high levels of LRRK2 expression in primary microglia that are the immune cells of the nervous system have been discovered (Moehle et al., J. Neuroscience (2012), PMID 22302802). This publication shows that knockdown of LRRK2 expression using RNA interference attenuates the induction of the pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic factor TNF-alpha. More recently, LRRK2 has also been detected in primary macrophages, specifically macrophages isolated after thioglycolate exposures in mice. To assess whether Example 90 can inhibit the G2019S-LRRK2 induced increase in TNF-alpha to wild-type levels of TNF-alpha induction by LPS, primary macrophages were exposed in culture to 5 μM 1 hour prior to LPS stimulation (100 ng/ml), and TNF-alpha levels were measured 6 hours later. Example 90 successfully returned G2019S-LRRK2 over-expressing cells back to WT levels, indicating that G2019S-LRRK2 was inhibited in these cells. In keeping with the present disclosure, the triazolopyridazine compounds of the present disclosure can be used alone or in appropriate association, and also may be used in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and other pharmaceutically active compounds. The active agent may be present in the pharmaceutical composition in any suitable quantity. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers described herein, for example, vehicles, adjuvants, excipients, or diluents, are well-known to those who are skilled in the art. Typically, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is chemically inert to the active compounds and has no detrimental side effects or toxicity under the conditions of use. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers can include polymers and polymer matrices. The choice of carrier will be determined in part by the particular method used to administer the composition. Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. The following formulations for oral, aerosol, parenteral, subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, rectal, and vaginal administration are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting. Formulations suitable for oral administration can consist of (a) liquid solutions, such as an effective amount of the compound dissolved in diluents, such as water, saline, or orange juice; (b) capsules, sachets, tablets, lozenges, and troches, each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as solids or granule; (c) powders; (d) suspensions in an appropriate liquid; and (e) suitable emulsions. Liquid formulations may include diluents, such as water, cyclodextrin, dimethyl sulfoxide and alcohols, for example, ethanol, benzyl alcohol, propylene glycol, glycerin, and the polyethylene alcohols including polyethylene glycol, either with or without the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant, suspending agent, or emulsifying agent. Capsule forms can be of the ordinary hard- or soft-shelled gelatin type containing, for example, surfactants, lubricants, and inert fillers, such as lactose, sucrose, calcium phosphate, and corn starch. Tablet forms can include one or more of the following: lactose, sucrose, mannitol, corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid, microcrystalline cellulose, acacia, gelatin, guar gum, colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, talc, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, stearic acid, and other excipients, colorants, diluents, buffering agents, disintegrating agents, moistening agents, preservatives, flavoring agents, and pharmacologically compatible carriers. Lozenge forms can comprise the active ingredient in a flavor, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, as well as pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acadia, emulsions, and gels containing, the addition to the active ingredient in an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acadia, emulsions, and gels containing, in addition to the active ingredient, such carriers as are known in the art. The triazolopyridazine compounds of the present disclosure alone or in combination with other suitable components, can be made into aerosol formulations to be administered via inhalation. These aerosol formulations can be placed into pressurized acceptable propellants, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, propane, and nitrogen. They also may be formulated as pharmaceuticals for non-pressured preparations, such as in a nebulizer or an atomizer. Formulations suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous, isotonic sterile injection solutions, which can contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats, and solutes that render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions that can include suspending agents, solubilizers, thickening agents, stabilizers, and preservatives. The compound can be administered in a physiologically acceptable diluent in a pharmaceutical carrier, such as a sterile liquid or mixture of liquids, including water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, an alcohol, such as ethanol, isopropanol, or hexadecyl alcohol, glycols, such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol such as poly(ethyleneglycol) 400, glycerol ketals, such as 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane-4-methanol, ethers, an oil, a fatty acid, a fatty acid ester or glyceride, or an acetylated fatty acid glyceride with or without the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant, such as a soap or a detergent, suspending agent, such as pectin, carbomers, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, or carboxymethylcelluslose, or emulsifying agents and other pharmaceutical adjuvants. Oils which can be used in parenteral formulations include petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic oils. Specific examples of oils include peanut, soybean, sesame, cottonseed, corn, olive, petrolatum, and mineral. Suitable fatty acids for use in parenteral formulations include oleic acid, stearic acid, and isostearic acid. Ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate are examples of suitable fatty acid esters. Suitable soaps for use in parenteral formulations include fatty alkali metal, ammonium, and triethanolamine salts, and suitable detergents include (a) cationic detergents such as, for example. dimethyldialkylammonium halides, and alkylpyridinium halides, (b) anionic detergents such as, for example, alkyl, aryl, and olefin sulfonates, alkyl olefin, ether, and monoglyceride sulfates, and sulfosuccinates, (c) nonionic detergents such as, for example, fatty amine oxides, fatty acid alkanolamides, and polyoxyethylene polypropylene copolymers, (d) amphoteric detergents such as, for example, alkyl β-aminopropionates, and 2-alkylimidazoline quaternary ammonium salts, and (e) mixtures thereof. The parenteral formulations typically contain from about 0.5% to about 25% by weight of the active ingredient in solution. Suitable preservatives and buffers can be used in such formulations. In order to minimize or eliminate irritation at the site of injection, such compositions may contain one or more nonionic surfactants having a hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) of from about 12 to about 17. The quantity of surfactant in such formulations ranges from about 5% to about 15% by weight. Suitable surfactants include polyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, such as sorbitan monooleate and the high molecular weight adducts of ethylene oxide with a hydrophobic base, formed by the condensation of propylene oxide with propylene glycol. Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are also well-known to those who are skilled in the art. The choice of excipient will be determined in part by the particular compound, as well as by the particular method used to administer the composition. Accordingly, there is a wide variety of suitable formulations of the pharmaceutical composition of the present disclosure. The following methods and excipients are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting. The pharmaceutically acceptable excipients preferably do not interfere with the action of the active ingredients and do not cause adverse side-effects. Suitable carriers and excipients include solvents such as water, alcohol, and propylene glycol, solid absorbants and diluents, surface active agents, suspending agent, tableting binders, lubricants, flavors, and coloring agents. The formulations can be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose sealed containers, such as ampules and vials, and can be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid excipient, for example, water, for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules, and tablets. The requirements for effective pharmaceutical carriers for injectable compositions are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. See Pharmaceutics and Pharmacy Practice, J.B. Lippincott Co., Philadelphia, Pa., Banker and Chalmers, Eds., 238-250 (1982) and ASHP Handbook on Injectable Drugs, Toissel, 4th ed., 622-630 (1986). Formulations suitable for topical administration include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavor, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert base, such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia; and mouthwashes comprising the active ingredient in a suitable liquid carrier; as well as creams, emulsions, and gels containing, in addition to the active ingredient, such carriers as are known in the art. Additionally, formulations suitable for rectal administration may be presented as suppositories by mixing with a variety of bases such as emulsifying bases or water-soluble bases. Formulations suitable for vaginal administration may be presented as pessaries, tampons, creams, gels, pastes, foams, or spray formulas containing, in addition to the active ingredient, such carriers as are known in the art to be appropriate. One skilled in the art will appreciate that suitable methods of exogenously administering a compound of the present disclosure to an animal are available, and, although more than one route can be used to administer a particular compound, a particular route can provide a more immediate and more effective reaction than another route. As regards these applications, the present method includes the administration to an animal, particularly a mammal, and more particularly a human, of a therapeutically effective amount of the compound effective in the inhibition of kinase protein and especially LRRK2. The method also includes the administration of a therapeutically effect amount of the compound for the treatment of patient having a predisposition for being afflicted with Parkinson's disease. The dose administered to an animal, particularly a human, in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to affect a therapeutic response in the animal over a reasonable time frame. One skilled in the art will recognize that dosage will depend upon a variety of factors including the condition of the animal, the body weight of the animal, as well as the severity and stage of the cancer. The total amount of the compound of the present disclosure administered in a typical treatment is preferably between about 10 mg/kg and about 1000 mg/kg of body weight for mice, and between about 100 mg/kg and about 500 mg/kg of body weight, and more preferably between 200 mg/kg and about 400 mg/kg of body weight for humans per daily dose. This total amount is typically, but not necessarily, administered as a series of smaller doses over a period of about one time per day to about three times per day for about 24 months, and preferably over a period of twice per day for about 12 months.
