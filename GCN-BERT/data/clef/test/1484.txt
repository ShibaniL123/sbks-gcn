useful improvements in COAL CUTTING MiCHIKSS, and particu¬ larly to machines of the class having a supporting frame adapted to be moved relative to the coal body, and cutting devices projecting therefrom adapted to engage the coal to form a kerf therein preparatory to blasting down the coal above the kerf. It is the especial object of this invention to provide, in a machine of the class described, means to form a single kerf in the coal body at the level of the mine floor, to form such a kerf in the coal body spaced above said floor, or to simultaneously form a plurality of spaced apart kerfs at the option of the operator. The means whereby I attain this object are fully set forth in the following specification and illustrated in the accompanying drawing of which Pig. 1 is a plan view of the preferred embodiment of my invention, the cover plates being broken away to reveal certain parts below. Fig. 2 is a side elevation of the machine shown in Fig. 1, the side plates being broken away to reveal the interior mechanism. Fig. 3 is a side elevation of the machine shown in Figs. 1 and 2, on a reduced scale, illustrating the manner of manipulating the cutting mechanism to simulta¬ neously cut a plurality of spaced apart kerfs.

Fig. 7 is a diagrammatic view showing the method of using the machine to gather the dislodged coal onto a conveyor for transportation. Like numerals refer to similar parts in the several figures. In the drawings, I have shown the preferred embodi¬ ment of my invention wherein the main frarae 1 comprises an elongated, rectangular structure adapted to rest upon and slide over the floor of the mine. Within the frame 1 is mounted a motor 2 by which the operative elements of the machine are actuated. The motor 2 may be of any preferred type suitable to the conditions under which the machine operates. For purposes of illustration, I have here shown an electric motor adapted to receive its actuating current through a suitable flexible conductor cable and to be controlled by the customary controlling mechanism, but as such devices are well understood in the mining machine art and as they form no part in the present invention, their illustration and description are not thought to be required at this time. The motor 2 is provided with an armature shaft 3 which projects at both ends of its casing and is provided with power transmitting devices at both ends. At its forward end, the main frame 1 contains the feeding mechanism by which the machine may bs moved over the floor of the mine. This feeding mechanism comprises . „ ,- • r - O '.'J a winding drura 4 upon which, is windable a flexible cable the free end of which is adapted to be connected with any suitable abutments such as the anchor jack 6 towards which the machine may be drawn when the cable is wound upon the drum. The drum 4- is rotatably supported upon a vertical shaft 7, and is connectible with a spur gear 8, also mounted upon the shaft 7, by means of a friction clutch contained within the drum 4, and controllable by the manipulation of a hand wheel 9 positioned convenient to the hand of the operator. The spur gear 8 meshes with a pinion 10 attached to a vertical shaft 11 journaled in suitable bearings of the main frame. Attached to the shaft 11 is a ratchet wheel 12 adapted to be engaged by a pawl 13 carried by the rocker arm. 14. The rocker arm 14 is connected through the connecting rod 15 with a crank 16 fixed to the shaft 17, and the shaft 17 carries a worm gear 18 which engages the worm 19 upon the forward end of the armature shaft 3. When the armature shaft 3 revolves, the rotative motion is trans¬ mitted through the worm 19, worm wheel 18, crank 16, rod 15, rocker arm 14, pawl 13, ratchet wheel IS, pinion 10, to the gear 8 and through the friction devices within the drum 4 to cause the rotation of said drum to wind the cable 5*. thereon. Suitable guide sheaves 20, mounted at the forward corners of the main frame 1, serve to guide the feed cable in the desired direction from the winding drum 4. From the rearward end of the main frame 1 there projects two brackets SI and SS having journal bearings S3, 24 and-25 in which the vertical shaft 26 is rotatably supported. The bracket 21'is shaped to form a gear case S7 within which is mounted a worm gear wheel 28 which is secured to the shaft 26 by a suitable key. The worm gear wheel S8 is engaged by a _4— ,- .- r- o";j worm 29 mounted upon the armature shaft extension 50 which is supported in suitable journal bearings formed on the bracket 21. The armature shaft extension 30 extends in axial alinement -with the armature shaft 3 and is adapted to be connected thereto by a suitable clutch 31. Mechanism is provided for the control of the clutch 31 but as such devices are well understood in the art, and as it forms no part of the present invention, its illustration and description is not thought to be required at this time. A sleeve 32, freely mounted upon the lower portion of the shaft 26, extends through the journal bearing 23 and to its lower end is fixed a sprocket wheel 33. At the upper end of the sleeve 32 are formed clutch teeth adapted to engage the corresponding teeth of a jaw clutch member 24 which is slidably attached to the shaft 26. A shifting lever 35 is arranged to move the clutch member 34 into or out of engagement with the sleeve 32 to operatively connect the sprocket wheel 33 with the shaft 26, or to dis¬ connect it therefrom as condition may require. A rock shaft 36 mounted upon the bracket 21 engages the clutch shifting lever 35, and this rock shaft is provided with a handle 37 positioned convenient to the hand of the operator, by the manipulation of which the clutch 34 may be controlled. Formed on the bracket 21 is a circular flange 38 which rotatably supports a turn table 39. Projecting horizontally from the turn table 39 is a cutter arm 40 upon the edges of which are formed guideways wherein travels the cutter chain 41 oft the type commonly used in coal mining machines to cut the coal. Provision is made at 42 whereby the free end of the feed cable 5 may be attached to the cutter ana 40, and a groove 43 formed in the periphery of the turn table 39 serves to guide said cable towards the guide sheave 20 so that, by the winding of the cable upon the binding drum 4 the cutter ana 40 may he caused to rotats about the axis or the turn table to cause the cutter chain 41 to engage the coal to cut it. Attached to the turn table 39 is a latch 44, the bolt of which is adapted to engage either of a series of apertures 45 formed in the frame casting 21, to lock the cutter arm rigidly in the preferred position of angular adjustment. Formed on the upper portion 27 of the bracket 21 is a circular flange 46 which rotatably supports a second turn table 47, and from this turn table 47 projects a second cutter bar 48 which is rotatable in a plane parallel to the plane of the cutter arm 40. A third circular flange 49 is formed upon the bracket 22 of the main frame and upon this flange is mounted a third turn table 50 from which projects a third cutter arm 51 also rotatable in a plane extending parallel to the planes of the cutter arms 40 and 48. In every respect the turn tables 47 and 50 and the cutter arms 48 and 51 are substantially similar to the corresponding part of the cutter arm 40. Rotatably mounted upon the shaft 26 are sprocket wheels 52 and 53 arranged in alinement with the guideways of the cutter arm 48 and 51 and these sprocket wheels engage the cutter chain 54 and 55 respectively. Upon the hub of each of the sprocket wheels 52 and 53 are formed clutch teeth adapted to engage with the clutch members 56 and 57 slidably attached to the shaft 26, and these clutches are pro¬ vided with suitable mechanism for their control so that either or all of the sprocket wheels 33, 52 and 53 may be connected to or disconnected from the shaft 26 to drive their respective cutter chains. Bolts 58 and 59 similar to the bolt 44 are arranged to lock the cutter arms 48 and 51 in the desired position of angular adjustment. Upon each side of the main frame 1 are mounted guide sheaves 60, 61 and 62 adapted to engage the feed cable 5 to lead it to either the turn table 47 or the turn table 50 to cause their respective rotation about the common axis. In Fig. 3 of the drawing I have shown an arrange¬ ment by which all three of the cutter arms 40, 48 and 51 may be simultaneously rotated to cut spaced apart kerfs in the coal face. As here illustrated the end of the feed cable is attached to a ring 63 from which extends three branch cables 64, 65 and 66 which are led around the guide sheaves 60, 61 and 62 appropriate to the turn tables 39, 47 and to simultaneously cause the cutter arms 40, 48 and 51 to form spaced apart parallel kerfs in the coal face. It is apparent that either of the branch cables 64, 65 or 66 may be omitted so as to cause the rotation of only two of the cutter arms. By* the devices above described, I have provided a machine adapted to form a kerf at the base of the mine vein, to form a kerf spaced above the mine floor, or to simultaneously form a plurality of kerfs extending in parallelism across the face of the vein. It is apparent that the machine here shown may be subject to wide varia¬ tion as to details, that either of the cutter areas may be omitted, or that any preferred number of additional cutter arms may be added without departure from the spirit of my invention. In operation, my improved mining machine is brought to the working place with all three of the cutter arms projecting longitudinally of the machine and locked in that position. The machine is then positioned adjacent the coal face, extending longitudinally therealong. The feed rope 5 is cLraifm out from the windixig drum and attached, in the i-anner above described, to the cutter arm or arms which-are appropriate to form the kerf or kerfs desired. The cutter chains ofsthe appropriate cutter arms are then actuated, the chains remaining idle upon any arm v;hich is not in active use at the time, and the winding drum is actuated to cause rotation of the appropriate cutter arm or arms to form the kerf or kerfs desired. After the cutter arm or arms have swung through the preferred angle it or they are locked in that position, the feed cable disconnected therefrom, conducted around the guide sheave 20 and attached to an anchor jack 6 positioned adjacent the coal face in advance of the machine. By the winding of the cable 5, the machine will be moved bodily along the coal face to produce a kerf or kerfs extending longitudinally thereof. The diameter of sprocket wheels 33, 52 and 53 is such . that the distance between the ends of diametrically opposite bits on the chains will be substantially equal to the width of the main frame. In this manner, the cutter chains will discharge to points beyond the path of advance of the machine, so that the machine may be returned over the same path without obstruction. In Tigs. 6 and 7 of the drawing, I have illustrated one method of operating my improved coal cutting machine in combination with a longwall conveyor of well known design to effect the mining and reclaiming of the coal. As here illustrated, the coal cutting machine is positioned adjacent the coal face 67 with the Mowenmost cutter arm 40 turned at right angles to the longitudinal lines of the machine and -S- -. .- - r"' C1 C2 inserted beneath the coal. The feed rope 5 extends along the coal face and is attached to a suitably positioned anchor jack 6 in advance of the machine. Positioned upon the mine floor, imraediately adjacent the outer side of the coal cutting machine, and extending parallel with the coal face 67, is a longwall conveyor comprising an elongated frame 68 and a laterally projecting plate 69 -which extends along the frsirie in contact with the mine floor. Within the frame 68, and consequently not visible in the drawing, is an endless chain to T/hich is attached the conveyor flights 70 which project across the plate 69 in contact therewith and are adapted, when said chain is actuated, to propel material along said plate. The construction of the frame 68 is such that it forms one side of a conveyor trough, the bottom of which is the plate 69. The opposite wall of the trough is formed by the loose coal lying upon the mine floor adjacent the plate 69. YJhen the coal cutter is actuated to undercut the coal, the cuttings produced by the kerf cutter 40 are delivered thereby onto the plate 69 and are transported by the scrapers 70 longitudinally of the conveyor to the discharge point, where they are delivered to a suitable receptacle for further disposition. After the coal cutting machine has advanced to the full length of the coal face, the coal above the kerf is dislodged from the body of the vein, by blasting or other suitable methods. All of the cutter arms 40, 48 and 51 are then turned to the position at.,right angles to the longitudinal lines of the machine and locked in that position. The feed rope 5 is adjusted over the guide sheaves 20, 60 and 62 and is attached to an anchor jack 71 suitably positioned'at the rearward side of the machine. The electric motor 2 is then actuated in such manner that the cutter chains 41, 54 and 55 will travel around the cutter frame 40, 48 and 51 in the direction opposite to that ox" the cutting operation. As the machine travels along the coal face, the cutter bits /of the three cutter arms will engage the dislodged and broken coal and move it outwardly onto the plate 69 to be transported by the conveyor flights 70 to the delivery end of the conveyor. , After all of the dislodged coal has been removed, the coal cutting machine will be repositioned adjacent the neisly formed coal face, the longwall conveyor repositioned adjacent the coal cutting ma chine, and the operation repeated ad libitum. tL What I claim is: 1.
