TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a polyimide having excellent properties such as transparency, bending resistance and high heat resistance, and having a very low coefficient of linear thermal expansion up to a high temperature; and a precursor thereof. The present invention also relates to a polyimide film, a varnish comprising a polyimide precursor or a polyimide, and a substrate. BACKGROUND ART With the coming of an advanced information society, the developments of optical materials such as an optical fiber and an optical waveguide in the field of optical communications, and optical materials such as a liquid crystal oriented film and a protective film for a color-filter in the field of display devices has recently advanced. In the field of display devices, in particular, a plastic substrate which is light-weight and excellent in flexibility has been studied as an alternative to a glass substrate, and the development of a display which is capable of being bent and rolled has been intensively conducted. Accordingly, there is need for a higher-performance optical material which may be used for such purposes. Aromatic polyimides are intrinsically yellowish-brown-colored due to the intramolecular conjugation and the formation of charge-transfer complexes. Consequently, as a means of reducing coloring, methods of developing transparency, for example, by introducing fluorine atom into the molecule, imparting flexibility to the main chain, introducing a bulky group as a side chain, or the like to suppress the intramolecular conjugation and the formation of charge-transfer complexes are proposed. In addition, methods of developing transparency by the use of a semi-alicyclic or wholly-alicyclic polyimide which do not form charge-transfer complexes in principle are also proposed. Patent Literature 1 discloses that a thin-film transistor substrate is obtained by forming a thin-film transistor on a film substrate of a transparent polyimide in which the residue of the tetracarboxylic acid component is an aliphatic group by the use of a conventional film-forming process in order to obtain a thin, light-weight and break-proof active matrix display device. The polyimide concretely used herein is prepared from 1,2,4,5-cyclohexane tetracarboxylic dianhydride as the tetracarboxylic acid component and 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl ether as the diamine component. Patent Literature 2 discloses a process for producing a colorless transparent resin film formed of a polyimide having excellent colorlessness/transparency, heat resistance and flatness, which is used for a transparent substrate for a liquid crystal display device or an organic EL display device, a thin-film transistor substrate, a flexible wiring substrate, and the like, by a solution-casting method using a particular drying step. The polyimide used herein is prepared from 1,2,4,5-cyclohexane tetracarboxylic dianhydride as the tetracarboxylic acid component and α,α′-bis(4-aminophenyl)-1,4-diisopropylbenzene and 4,4′-bis(4-aminophenoxy)biphenyl as the diamine component, and the like. Patent Literatures 3 and 4 disclose polyimides which are soluble in organic solvents, and prepared using dicyclohexyl tetracarboxylic acid as the tetracarboxylic acid component and diaminodiphenyl ether, diaminodiphenyl methane, 1,4-bis(4-aminophenoxy)benzene, 1,3-bis(4-aminophenoxy)benzene, 2,2-bis[4-(4-aminophenoxyl)phenyl]propane, bis[4-(4-aminophenoxyl)phenyl]sulfone, bis[4-(4-aminophenoxyl)phenyl]ether or m-phenylenediamine as the diamine component. Such a semi-alicyclic polyimide, in which an alicyclic tetracarboxylic dianhydride is used as the tetracarboxylic acid component and an aromatic diamine is used as the diamine component, combines transparency, bending resistance and high heat resistance. However, such a semi-alicyclic polyimide generally has a great coefficient of linear thermal expansion of 50 ppm/K or more, and therefore the difference in coefficient of linear thermal expansion between a semi-alicyclic polyimide and a conductive material such as a metal is great, and a trouble such as an increase in warpage may occur during the formation of a circuit board, and there has been a problem of not easily performing a process for forming a fine circuit for use in a display, or the like, in particular. Patent Literature 5 discloses a polyimide obtained from an alicyclic acid dianhydride containing ester bond and a varied aromatic diamine, and the polyimide of Example 4, for example, has a coefficient of linear thermal expansion at 100° C. to 200° C. of not more than 50 ppm/K. However, the polyimide has a glass-transition temperature of about 300° C., and it is assumed that the film softens and the coefficient of linear thermal expansion becomes much greater at a higher temperature, and there is a risk that a trouble occurs in a process for forming a circuit, which requires low thermal expansibility at a high temperature, as well as at a low temperature. Non Patent Literature 1 discloses a polyimide prepared using norbornane-2-spiro-α-cyclopentanone-α′-spiro-2″-norbornane-5,5″,6,6″-tetracarboxylic dianhydride as the tetracarboxylic acid component. Non Patent Literature 1 discloses that the polyimide has high heat resistance and also has a high glass-transition temperature. Moreover, Non Patent Literature 1 discloses that the norbornane-2-spiro-α-cyclopentanone-α′-spiro-2″-norbornane-5,5″,6,6″-tetracarboxylic dianhydride used herein comprises six types of stereoisomers. Patent Literature 6 discloses a polyimide prepared using norbornane-2-spiro-α-cyclopentanone-α′-spiro-2″-norbornane-5,5″,6,6″-tetracarboxylic dianhydride and 4,4′-oxydianiline, and the like. However, no mention is made of steric structure of norbornane-2-spiro-α-cyclopentanone-α′-spiro-2″-norbornane-5,5″,6,6″-tetracarboxylic dianhydride.

The diamine component to provide a repeating unit of the chemical formula (3) in which A2 is a structure of the chemical formula (4) has an aromatic ring, and when the diamine component has a plurality of aromatic rings, the aromatic rings are each independently linked to each other by direct bond, amide bond, or ester bond. When the aromatic rings are linked at the 4-position relative to the amino group or the linking group between the aromatic rings, the obtained polyimide has a linear structure and may have low linear thermal expansibility, although the linking position of the aromatic rings is not limited thereto. Meanwhile, the aromatic ring may be substituted by methyl or trifluoromethyl. The substitution position is not particularly limited.

These diamines may be used alone or in combination of a plurality of types. In one embodiment, the one in which the diamine component is only 4,4′-diaminobenzanilide singly may be excluded.

In the polyimide precursor (A-3) of the third invention, the diamine component to provide the other repeating unit other than the repeating unit represented by the chemical formula (5) and the repeating unit represented by the chemical formula (6) may be any one of the diamine components to provide a structure of the chemical formula (7). In other words, the aromatic diamines described as the diamine component to provide repeating units of the chemical formula (5) and the chemical formula (6) in which A3 is a structure of the chemical formula (7) may be used as the diamine component to provide the other repeating unit other than the repeating units represented by the chemical formula (5) and the chemical formula (6). These diamines may be used alone or in combination of a plurality of types. In the polyimide precursor (A-3) of the third invention, other aromatic or aliphatic diamines may be used as the diamine component to provide the other repeating unit other than the repeating unit represented by the chemical formula (5) and the repeating unit represented by the chemical formula (6).

These may be used alone or in combination of a plurality of types. The purity of the tetracarboxylic acid component to be used in the present invention may be preferably, but not limited to, 99% or more, more preferably 99.5% or more. (In the case where the component contains a plurality of structural isomers, the purity is determined on the condition that the structural isomers are regarded as the same component without distinguishing them. In the case where a plurality of types of tetracarboxylic acid components are used, the purity is the value of the tetracarboxylic acid component having the highest purity, or the average value of the purities of all tetracarboxylic acid components to be used which are determined separately and weighted with the mass ratio of the used components; for example, the purity of the tetracarboxylic acid component used is calculated to be 97% when 70 parts by mass of a tetracarboxylic acid component having a purity of 100% and 30 parts by mass of a tetracarboxylic acid component having a purity of 90% are used). When the purity is less than 98%, the molecular weight of the polyimide precursor may not be sufficiently increased and the obtained polyimide may have low heat resistance. The purity is a value which may be determined by gas chromatography analysis, liquid chromatography analysis or 1H-NMR analysis, or the like. In the case of a tetracarboxylic dianhydride, the purity may be determined by subjecting the tetracarboxylic dianhydride to hydrolysis treatment to form a tetracarboxylic acid, and determining the purity of the tetracarboxylic acid. The purity of the diamine component to be used in the present invention may be preferably, but not limited to, 99% or more, more preferably 99.5% or more. (In the case where a plurality of types of diamine components are used, the purity is the value of the diamine component having the highest purity, or the average value of the purities of all diamine components to be used which are determined separately and weighted with the mass ratio of the used components; for example, the purity of the diamine component used is calculated to be 97% when 70 parts by mass of a diamine component having a purity of 100% and 30 parts by mass of a diamine component having a purity of 90% are used). When the purity is less than 98%, the molecular weight of the polyimide precursor may not be sufficiently increased and the obtained polyimide may have low heat resistance. The purity is a value which may be determined by gas chromatography analysis, liquid chromatography analysis or 1H-NMR analysis, or the like. Norbornane-2-spiro-α-cyclopentanone-α′-spiro-2″-norbornane-5,5″,6,6″-tetracarboxylic acid, or the like may be synthesized by the method described in Patent Literature 6, and the like, although the method for synthesizing norbornane-2-spiro-α-cyclopentanone-α′-spiro-2″-norbornane-5,5″,6,6″-tetracarboxylic acid, or the like is not limited thereto. As described in Non Patent Literature 1, norbornane-2-spiro-α-cyclopentanone-α′-spiro-2″-norbornane-5,5″,6,6″-tetracarboxylic acid, or the like may comprise several types of stereoisomers, which depends on the synthesis method. Norbornane-2-spiro-α-cyclopentanone-α′-spiro-2″-norbornane-5,5″,6,6″-tetracarboxylic acid, or the like, or an intermediate thereof may be subjected to purification by the use of column, or the like to isolate each one of stereoisomers, or a mixture of several types of stereoisomers. Single products of, or a mixture of trans-endo-endo-norbornane-2-spiro-α-cyclopentanone-α′-spiro-2″-norbornane-5,5″,6,6″-tetracarboxylic acid, or the like, and cis-endo-endo-norbornane-2-spiro-α-cyclopentanone-α′-spiro-2″-norbornane-5,5″,6,6″-tetracarboxylic acid, or the like may be also obtained by subjecting norbornane-2-spiro-α-cyclopentanone-α′-spiro-2″-norbornane-5,5″,6,6″-tetracarboxylic acid, or the like, or an intermediate thereof to purification by the use of column, or the like. As for the polyimide precursor of the present invention [polyimide precursors (A-1) (A-2) and (A-3)], when the tetracarboxylic acid component and the diamine component comprise isomers, each one of the isomers may be isolated and used for the polymerization, or the like, or alternatively, the isomers as the mixture may be used for the polymerization, or the like. In the polyimide precursor of the present invention, X1 and Y1 in the chemical formula (1), X2 and Y2 in the chemical formula (3), X3 and Y3 in the chemical formula (5), and X4 and Y4 in the chemical formula (6) are each independently hydrogen, an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, or an alkylsilyl group having 3 to 9 carbon atoms. As for X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3, X4 and Y4, the types of the functional groups and the introduction ratio of the functional groups may be changed by the production method as described later. In the case where X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3, X4 and Y4 are hydrogen, a polyimide tends to be easily produced therefrom. Meanwhile, in the case where X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3, X4 and Y4 are each an alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, preferably having 1 to 3 carbon atoms, the polyimide precursor tends to have excellent storage stability. In this case, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3, X4 and Y4 are more preferably methyl or ethyl. Additionally, in the case where X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3, X4 and Y4 are each an alkylsilyl group having 3 to 9 carbon atoms, the polyimide precursor tends to have excellent solubility. In this case, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3, X4 and Y4 are more preferably trimethylsilyl or t-butyldimethylsilyl. When an alkyl group or an alkylsilyl group is introduced, X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3, X4 and Y4 each may be converted into an alkyl group or an alkylsilyl group in a ratio of 25% or more, preferably 50% or more, more preferably 75% or more, although the introduction ratio of the functional groups is not limited thereto. When X1, Y1, X2, Y2, X3, Y3, X4 and Y4 each are converted into an alkyl group or an alkylsilyl group in a ratio of 25% or more, the polyimide precursor may have excellent storage stability. According to the chemical structures X1 and Y1, X2 and Y2, X3 and Y3, or X4 and Y4 have, the polyimide precursors of the present invention may be each independently classified into 1) polyamic acid (X1 and Y1, X2 and Y2, X3 and Y3, or X4 and Y4 are hydrogen), 2) polyamic acid ester (at least part of X1 and Y1 is an alkyl group, at least part of X2 and Y2 is an alkyl group, at least part of X3 and Y3 is an alkyl group, or at least part of X4 and Y4 is an alkyl group), and 3) 4) polyamic acid silyl ester (at least part of X1 and Y1 is an alkylsilyl group, at least part of X2 and Y2 is an alkylsilyl group, at least part of X3 and Y3 is an alkylsilyl group, or at least part of X4 and Y4 is an alkylsilyl group). Each class of the polyimide precursors of the present invention may be easily produced by the following production methods. However, the method for producing the polyimide precursor of the present invention is not limited to the following production methods. 1) Polyamic Acid The polyimide precursor of the present invention may be suitably obtained, in the form of a polyimide precursor solution composition, by reacting a tetracarboxylic dianhydride as a tetracarboxylic acid component and a diamine component in a substantially equimolar amount, preferably in a molar ratio of the diamine component to the tetracarboxylic acid component [molar number of the diamine component/molar number of the tetracarboxylic acid component] of 0.90 to 1.10, more preferably 0.95 to 1.05, in a solvent at a relatively low temperature of 120° C. or less, for example, to suppress the imidization. More specifically, the polyimide precursor may be obtained by dissolving the diamine in an organic solvent, adding the tetracarboxylic dianhydride to the resulting solution gradually while stirring the solution, and then stirring the solution at a temperature of 0° C. to 120° C., preferably 5° C. to 80° C., for 1 hour to 72 hours, although the method for synthesizing the polyimide precursor of the present invention is not limited thereto. When they are reacted at a temperature of 80° C. or more, the molecular weight may vary depending on the temperature history in the polymerization and the imidization may proceed by heat, and therefore the polyimide precursor may not be stably produced. The sequence of the addition of the diamine and the tetracarboxylic dianhydride in the production method as described above is preferred because the molecular weight of the polyimide precursor is apt to increase. Meanwhile, the sequence of the addition of the diamine and the tetracarboxylic dianhydride in the production method as described above may be reversed, and the sequence is preferred because the amount of the precipitate is reduced. In addition, when the diamine component is excessive in the molar ratio of the tetracarboxylic acid component to the diamine component, a carboxylic acid derivative may be added in an amount which substantially corresponds to the excessive molar number of the diamine component, as necessary, so that the molar ratio of the tetracarboxylic acid component to the diamine component is closer to the substantially equimolar amount. As the carboxylic acid derivative to be used herein, tetracarboxylic acids, which do not substantially increase the viscosity of the polyimide precursor solution, that is, do not substantially involve the molecular chain extension, or tricarboxylic acids and anhydrides thereof, and dicarboxylic acids and anhydrides thereof, which function as an end-stopping agent, and the like are preferred. 2) Polyamic Acid Ester A diester dicarboxylic acid chloride may be obtained by reacting a tetracarboxylic dianhydride and an arbitrary alcohol to provide a diester dicarboxylic acid, and then reacting the diester dicarboxylic acid and a chlorinating agent (thionyl chloride, oxalyl chloride, and the like). The polyimide precursor may be obtained by stirring the diester dicarboxylic acid chloride and a diamine at a temperature of −20° C. to 120° C., preferably −5° C. to 80° C., for 1 hour to 72 hours. When they are reacted at a temperature of 80° C. or more, the molecular weight may vary depending on the temperature history in the polymerization and the imidization may proceed by heat, and therefore the polyimide precursor may not be stably produced. In addition, the polyimide precursor may also be easily obtained by dehydrating/condensing a diester dicarboxylic acid and a diamine by the use of a phosphorus-based condensing agent, a carbodiimide condensing agent, or the like. The polyimide precursor obtained by the method is stable, and therefore the polyimide precursor may be subjected to purification, for example, reprecipitation in which a solvent such as water and alcohols is added thereto. 3) Polyamic Acid Silyl Ester (Indirect Method) A silylated diamine may be obtained by reacting a diamine and a silylating agent in advance. The silylated diamine may be purified by distillation, or the like, as necessary. And then, the polyimide precursor may be obtained by dissolving the silylated diamine in a dehydrated solvent, adding a tetracarboxylic dianhydride to the resulting solution gradually while stirring the solution, and then stirring the solution at a temperature of 0° C. to 120° C., preferably 5° C. to 80° C., for 1 hour to 72 hours. When they are reacted at a temperature of 80° C. or more, the molecular weight may vary depending on the temperature history in the polymerization and the imidization may proceed by heat, and therefore the polyimide precursor may not be stably produced. As for the silylating agent to be used herein, the use of a silylating agent containing no chlorine is preferred because it is unnecessary to purify the silylated diamine. Examples of the silylating agent containing no chlorine atom include N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide, and hexamethyldisilazane. Among them, N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide, and hexamethyldisilazane are particularly preferred, because they contain no fluorine atom and are inexpensive. In addition, in the silylation reaction of diamine, an amine catalyst such as pyridine, piperidine and triethylamine may be used so as to accelerate the reaction. The catalyst may be used, as it is, as a catalyst for the polymerization of the polyimide precursor. 4) Polyamic Acid Silyl Ester (Direct Method) The polyimide precursor may be obtained by mixing a polyamic acid solution obtained by the method 1) and a silylating agent, and then stirring the resulting mixture at a temperature of 0° C. to 120° C., preferably 5° C. to 80° C., for 1 hour to 72 hours. When they are reacted at a temperature of 80° C. or more, the molecular weight may vary depending on the temperature history in the polymerization and the imidization may proceed by heat, and therefore the polyimide precursor may not be stably produced. As for the silylating agent to be used herein, the use of a silylating agent containing no chlorine is preferred because it is unnecessary to purify the silylated polyamic acid, or the obtained polyimide. Examples of the silylating agent containing no chlorine atom include N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide, and hexamethyldisilazane. Among them, N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide, and hexamethyldisilazane are particularly preferred, because they contain no fluorine atom and are inexpensive. All of the production methods as described above may be suitably performed in an organic solvent, and as a consequence a varnish of the polyimide precursor of the present invention may be easily obtained. As the solvent used in the production of the polyimide precursor, for example, aprotic solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone and dimethyl sulfoxide are preferred, and N,N-dimethylacetamide and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone are particularly preferred. However, any solvent may be used without any trouble on the condition that the starting monomer components and the formed polyimide precursor can be dissolved in the solvent, and the structure of the solvent is not limited thereto. Examples of the solvent preferably employed include amide solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide and N-methylpyrrolidone; cyclic ester solvents such as γ-butyrolactone, γ-valerolactone, δ-valerolactone, γ-caprolactone, ε-caprolactone and α-methyl-γ-butyrolactone; carbonate solvents such as ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate; glycol solvents such as triethylene glycol; phenol solvents such as m-cresol, p-cresol, 3-chlorophenol and 4-chlorophenol; acetophenone, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, sulfolane, and dimethylsulfoxide. In addition, other common organic solvents, namely, phenol, o-cresol, butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, propyleneglycol methyl acetate, ethyl cellosolve, butyl cellosolve, 2-methyl cellosolve acetate, ethyl cellosolve acetate, butyl cellosolve acetate, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, diethoxyethane, dibutyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, methyl isobutyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, butanol, ethanol, xylene, toluene, chlorobenzene, turpentine, mineral spirits, petroleum naphtha-based solvents, and the like may be used. These solvents may be used in combination of a plurality of types. In the present invention, although the logarithmic viscosity of the polyimide precursor is not limited thereto, the logarithmic viscosity of the polyimide precursor in a N,N-dimethylacetamide solution at a concentration of 0.5 g/dL at 30° C. may be preferably 0.2 dL/g or more, more preferably 0.8 dL/g or more, particularly preferably 0.9 dL/g or more. When the logarithmic viscosity is 0.2 dL/g or more, the molecular weight of the polyimide precursor is high, and therefore the obtained polyimide may have excellent mechanical strength and heat resistance. In the present invention, it is preferred that the varnish of the polyimide precursor comprises at least the polyimide precursor of the present invention and a solvent, and the total amount of the tetracarboxylic acid component and the diamine component is 5 mass % or more, preferably 10 mass % or more, more preferably 15 mass % or more, based on the total amount of the solvent, the tetracarboxylic acid component and the diamine component. Additionally, it is generally preferred that the total amount is 60 mass % or less, preferably 50 mass % or less. When the concentration, which is approximate to the concentration of the solid content based on the polyimide precursor, is too low, it may be difficult to control the thickness of the obtained polyimide film in the production of the polyimide film, for example. As the solvent used for the varnish of the polyimide precursor of the present invention, any solvent may be used without any trouble on the condition that the polyimide precursor can be dissolved in the solvent, and the structure of the solvent is not particularly limited. Examples of the solvent preferably employed include amide solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone; cyclic ester solvents such as γ-butyrolactone, γ-valerolactone, δ-valerolactone, γ-caprolactone, ε-caprolactone and α-methyl-γ-butyrolactone; carbonate solvents such as ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate; glycol solvents such as triethylene glycol; phenol solvents such as m-cresol, p-cresol, 3-chlorophenol and 4-chlorophenol; acetophenone, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, sulfolane, and dimethylsulfoxide. In addition, other common organic solvents, namely, phenol, o-cresol, butyl acetate, ethyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, propyleneglycol methyl acetate, ethyl cellosolve, butyl cellosolve, 2-methyl cellosolve acetate, ethyl cellosolve acetate, butyl cellosolve acetate, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane, diethoxyethane, dibutyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, methyl isobutyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, methyl ethyl ketone, acetone, butanol, ethanol, xylene, toluene, chlorobenzene, turpentine, mineral spirits, petroleum naphtha-based solvents, and the like may be used. Additionally, these may be used in combination of a plurality of types. In the present invention, although the viscosity (rotational viscosity) of the varnish of the polyimide precursor is not limited thereto, the rotational viscosity, which is measured with an E-type rotational viscometer at a temperature of 25° C. and at a shearing speed of 20 sec−1, may be preferably 0.01 to 1000 Pa-sec, more preferably 0.1 to 100 Pa-sec. In addition, thixotropy may be imparted, as necessary. When the viscosity is within the above-mentioned range, the varnish is easy to handle during the coating or the film formation, and the varnish is less repelled and has excellent leveling property, and therefore a good film may be obtained. As necessary, a chemical imidizing agent (an acid anhydride such as acetic anhydride, and an amine compound such as pyridine and isoquinoline), an anti-oxidizing agent, a filler, a dye, a pigment, a coupling agent such as a silane coupling agent, a primer, a flame retardant, a defoaming agent, a leveling agent, a rheology control agent (flow-promoting agent), a releasing agent, and the like may be added to the varnish of the polyimide precursor of the present invention. As necessary, an inorganic particle such as silica may be mixed into the varnish of the polyimide precursor of the present invention. Examples of the mixing method include, but not limited to, a method in which an inorganic particle is dispersed in a polymerization solvent, and then a polyimide precursor is polymerized in the solvent; a method in which a polyimide precursor solution and an inorganic particle are mixed; a method in which a polyimide precursor solution and an inorganic particle dispersion are mixed; and a method in which an inorganic particle is added to and mixed with a polyimide precursor solution. For example, a silica particle or a silica particle dispersion may be added to the varnish of the polyimide precursor of the present invention. As for the silica particle to be added, the particle size is preferably 100 nm or less, more preferably 50 nm or less, particularly preferably 30 nm or less. When the particle size of the silica particle to be added is more than 100 nm, the polyimide may be white-turbid.

Preferred examples of the form of the obtained polyimide include a film, a laminate of a polyimide film and another substrate, a coating film, a powder, a bead, a molded article, a foamed article, and a varnish.

When the concentration is too low, it may be difficult to control the thickness of the obtained polyimide film in the production of the polyimide film, for example. As the solvent used for the varnish of the polyimide of the present invention, any solvent may be used without any trouble on the condition that the polyimide can be dissolved in the solvent, and the structure of the solvent is not particularly limited. The solvent used for the varnish of the polyimide precursor of the present invention as described above may be used likewise as the solvent. In the present invention, although the viscosity (rotational viscosity) of the varnish of the polyimide is not limited thereto, the rotational viscosity, which is measured with an E-type rotational viscometer at a temperature of 25° C. and at a shearing speed of 20 sec−1, may be preferably 0.01 to 1000 Pa-sec, more preferably 0.1 to 100 Pa-sec. In addition, thixotropy may be imparted, as necessary. When the viscosity is within the above-mentioned range, the varnish is easy to handle during the coating or the film formation, and the varnish is less repelled and has excellent leveling property, and therefore a good film may be obtained. As necessary, an anti-oxidizing agent, a filler, a dye, a pigment, a coupling agent such as a silane coupling agent, a primer, a flame retardant, a defoaming agent, a leveling agent, a rheology control agent (flow-promoting agent), a releasing agent, and the like may be added to the varnish of the polyimide of the present invention. As necessary, an inorganic particle such as silica may be mixed into the polyimide obtained from the polyimide precursor of the present invention and the polyimide of the present invention. Examples of the mixing method include, but not limited to, a method in which an inorganic particle is dispersed in a polymerization solvent, and then a polyimide precursor is polymerized in the solvent; a method in which a polyimide precursor solution and an inorganic particle are mixed; a method in which a polyimide precursor solution and an inorganic particle dispersion are mixed; a method in which an inorganic particle is mixed into a polyimide solution; and a method in which an inorganic particle dispersion is mixed into a polyimide solution. A silica-containing polyimide may be obtained by imidizing a polyimide precursor in a silica-dispersed polyimide precursor solution in which silica is dispersed by any one of these methods; or by mixing a polyimide solution with a silica particle or a silica-dispersed solution, and then heating and drying the mixture to remove the solvent therefrom.

As for the silica particle to be added, the particle size is preferably 100 nm or less, more preferably 50 nm or less, particularly preferably 30 nm or less. When the particle size of the silica particle to be added is more than 100 nm, the polyimide may be white-turbid. Additionally, in the case where a silica particle dispersion is used, “ORGANOSILICASOL DMAc-ST (primary particle size: 10-15 nm, dispersion solvent: N,N-dimethylacetamide) solid content: 20-21%” made by Nissan Chemical Industries, Ltd., and the like may be used, for example. The polyimide obtained from the polyimide precursor of the present invention and the polyimide of the present invention may have preferably, but not limited to, a coefficient of linear thermal expansion from 50° C. to 400° C. of 45 ppm/K or less, more preferably 30 ppm/K or less, more preferably 25 ppm/K or less, more preferably 24 ppm/K or less, more preferably 22 ppm/K or less, particularly preferably 20 ppm/K or less, when the polyimide is formed into a film, and have a very low coefficient of linear thermal expansion up to a high temperature. When the coefficient of linear thermal expansion is great, the difference in coefficient of linear thermal expansion between the polyimide and a conductive material such as a metal is great, and therefore a trouble such as an increase in warpage may occur during the formation of a circuit board. The polyimide obtained from the polyimide precursor of the present invention and the polyimide of the present invention may have preferably, but not limited to, a light transmittance at 400 nm of 70% or more, more preferably 75% or more, more preferably 77% or more, more preferably 78% or more, more preferably 79% or more, particularly preferably 80% or more, in the form of a film having a thickness of 10 μm, and have excellent optical transparency. When the light transmittance is low, the light source must be bright, and therefore a problem of more energy required, or the like may arise in the case where the polyimide is used in display application, or the like. The polyimide obtained from the polyimide precursor of the present invention and the polyimide of the present invention may have preferably, but not limited to, a total light transmittance (average light transmittance at wavelengths of 380 nm to 780 nm) of 85% or more, more preferably 86% or more, more preferably 87% or more, particularly preferably 88% or more, in the form of a film having a thickness of 10 μm, and have excellent optical transparency. When the total light transmittance is low, the light source must be bright, and therefore a problem of more energy required, or the like may arise in the case where the polyimide is used in display application, or the like. As for a film formed of the polyimide of the present invention, the thickness of the film is preferably 1 μm to 250 μm, more preferably 1 μm to 150 μm, more preferably 1 μm to 50 μm, particularly preferably 1 μm to 30 μm, although it varies depending on the intended use. When the polyimide film is too thick, the light transmittance may be low in the case where the polyimide film is used in applications where light passes through the polyimide film. The polyimide obtained from the polyimide precursor of the present invention and the polyimide of the present invention may have preferably, but not limited to, a 5% weight loss temperature of more than 470° C., more preferably 480° C. or more, more preferably 490° C. or more, particularly preferably 495° C. or more. In the case where a gas barrier film, or the like is formed on the polyimide for the formation of a transistor on the polyimide, or the like, swelling may occur between the polyimide and the barrier film due to outgassing associated with the decomposition of the polyimide, or the like when the heat resistance is low. The polyimide obtained from the polyimide precursor of the present invention and the polyimide of the present invention has excellent properties such as high transparency, bending resistance and high heat resistance, and has a very low coefficient of linear thermal expansion up to a high temperature, and therefore the polyimide may be suitably used in the applications of transparent substrate for display, transparent substrate for touch panel, or substrate for solar battery. One example of a method for producing a polyimide film/base laminate, or a polyimide film with the use of the polyimide precursor of the present invention will be described hereinafter. However, the method is not limited to the following method. For example, a varnish of the polyimide precursor of the present invention is flow-cast on a base of ceramic (glass, silicon, or alumina), metal (copper, aluminum, or stainless steel), heat-resistant plastic film (polyimide), or the like, and dried at a temperature of 20° C. to 180° C., preferably 20° C. to 150° C., by the use of hot air or infrared ray in a vacuum, in an inert gas such as nitrogen, or in air. And then, the obtained polyimide precursor film is heated and imidized at a temperature of 200° C. to 500° C., more preferably about 250° C. to about 450° C., by the use of hot air or infrared ray in a vacuum, in an inert gas such as nitrogen, or in air, wherein the polyimide precursor film is on the base, or alternatively, the polyimide precursor film is peeled from the base and fixed at the edges, to provide a polyimide film/base laminate, or a polyimide film. The thermal imidization is preferably performed in a vacuum or in an inert gas so as to prevent oxidation and degradation of the obtained polyimide film. The thermal imidization may be performed in air if the thermal imidization temperature is not too high. At this point, the thickness of the polyimide film (the polyimide film layer, in the case of a polyimide film/base laminate) is preferably 1 μm to 250 μm, more preferably 1 μm to 150 μm, in view of the transportability in the subsequent steps. The imidization reaction of the polyimide precursor may also be performed by chemical treatment in which the polyimide precursor is immersed in a solution containing a dehydrating/cyclizing agent such as acetic anhydride in the presence of a tertiary amine such as pyridine and triethylamine, instead of the thermal imidization by heat treatment as described above. Alternatively, a partially-imidized polyimide precursor may be prepared by adding the dehydrating/cyclizing agent to the varnish of the polyimide precursor in advance and stirring the varnish, and then flow-casting the varnish on a base and drying it. A polyimide film/base laminate, or a polyimide film may be obtained by further heating the partially-imidized polyimide precursor as described above. A flexible conductive substrate may be obtained by forming a conductive layer on one surface or both surfaces of the polyimide film/base laminate or the polyimide film thus obtained. A flexible conductive substrate may be obtained by the following methods, for example. As for the first method, the polyimide film is not peeled from the base in the “polyimide film/base” laminate, and a conductive layer of a conductive material (metal or metal oxide, conductive organic material, conductive carbon, or the like) is formed on the surface of the polyimide film by sputtering, vapor deposition, printing, or the like, to provide a conductive laminate of “conductive layer/polyimide film/base”. And then, as necessary, the “conductive layer/polyimide film” laminate is peeled from the base, to provide a transparent and flexible conductive substrate which consists of the “conductive layer/polyimide film” laminate. As for the second method, the polyimide film is peeled from the base in the “polyimide film/base” laminate to obtain the polyimide film, and then a conductive layer of a conductive material (metal or metal oxide, conductive organic material, conductive carbon, or the like) is formed on the surface of the polyimide film in the same way as in the first method, to provide a transparent and flexible conductive substrate which consists of the “conductive layer/polyimide film” laminate or “conductive layer/polyimide film/conductive layer” laminate. In the first and the second methods, a gas barrier layer against water vapor, oxygen, or the like, and an inorganic layer such as a light-controlling layer may be formed on the surface of the polyimide film by sputtering, vapor deposition, gel-sol process, or the like, as necessary, before the conductive layer is formed. In addition, a circuit may be suitably formed on the conductive layer by photolithography process, various printing processes, ink-jet process, or the like. The substrate of the present invention comprises a circuit of a conductive layer on a surface of a polyimide film formed of the polyimide of the present invention, optionally with a gas barrier layer or an inorganic layer therebetween, as necessary. The substrate is flexible, and excellent in high transparency, bending resistance and heat resistance, and also has a very low coefficient of linear thermal expansion up to a high temperature and excellent solvent resistance, and therefore a fine circuit may be easily formed thereon. Accordingly, the substrate may be suitably used as a substrate for display, touch panel, or solar battery. More specifically, a flexible thin-film transistor is produced by further forming a transistor (inorganic transistor, or organic transistor) on the substrate by vapor deposition, various printing processes, ink-jet process, or the like, and is suitably used as a liquid crystal device for display device, an EL device, or a photoelectric device.
