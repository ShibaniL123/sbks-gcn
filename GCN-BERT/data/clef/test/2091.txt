TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a meglumine salt of 6-fluoro-3-hydroxy-2-pyrazinecarboxamide (hereinafter referred to as “Compound A”), an injectable preparation containing the same and a process thereof. BACKGROUND ART These days, worldwide pandemic has been caused by H1N1 influenza virus and occurrence of pandemic by a further virulent virus in the future is a concern. At present, as therapeutic agents for influenza, e.g., Oseltamivir, Zanamivir, Peramivir, Laninamivir and Amantadine are used. However, these therapeutic agents have, for example, the following drawbacks. Oseltamivir cannot be administered to patients having difficulty in oral administration. It is difficult to administer Zanamivir to children and aged persons. It takes a long time to administer Peramivir. Amantadine is ineffective against Type B influenza virus and resistant viruses have emerged. Laninamivir is an inhalation drug, which is not suitable to patients with dementia and a severe disease and it is difficult to administer it to children. A further superior therapeutic agent for influenza has been desired. Particularly, an injection that can be administered to patients having difficulty in oral administration, children and aged persons has been desired. Meanwhile, many reports have been published on methods for improving solubility of medicinal compounds in water. For example, a method for improving the solubility in water by changing the state of a water-insoluble medicinal compound into an amorphous state is known. In general, an amorphous state of a compound exhibits more superior solubility in water than a crystalline state thereof (PATENT DOCUMENT 1). Compound A or a salt thereof has a superior antiviral activity and is useful as a therapeutic agent for viral infection (PATENT DOCUMENT 2). However, Compound A has low solubility in water and thus an injection of Compound A or a salt thereof has not been known yet. The present inventors prepared an aqueous solution of a sodium salt of Compound A by using sodium hydroxide generally used as a base, and then produced a lyophilized preparation in accordance with a common method, for improving the water solubility of Compound A. The sodium salt of Compound A obtained by this process was an amorphous dry powder, thus quick dissolution thereof in water was expected. However, contrary to the expectation, the obtained lyophilized preparation was a lyophilized cake having poor solubility and required a long time to dissolve. To describe more specifically, when a solvent was added to the lyophilized preparation, the lyophilized cake changed into a poorly soluble mass substance that took a long time to dissolve. The amorphous lyophilized preparation of a sodium salt of Compound A was a preparation needing a long time to dissolve, and was difficult to handle with significant loss of convenience in use. Meanwhile, as a method for preparing a lyophilized preparation, a process having an annealing step provided therein is known. However, the effect of the annealing step on the solubility of a lyophilized preparation differs depending on substances. Therefore, studies have been made in a trial-and-error manner (NON-PATENT DOCUMENT 1). PRIOR ARTS REFERENCES Patent Documents PATENT DOCUMENT 1: JP 3413406 PATENT DOCUMENT 2: International Publication No. WO 00/10569 pamphlet NON-PATENT DOCUMENT 1: Development of medicinal drug, Vol. 11, page 393, 2000 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION Problem to be Solved by the Invention There is a need for the development of an injectable preparation of Compound A or a salt thereof with superior solubility. Means for Solving the Problems The present inventors have intensively conducted studies with the view to attaining the above desire. As a result, they have found that (1) a meglumine salt of Compound A (hereinafter referred to as “Salt A”) can also be present in an amorphous or crystalline state, (2) the solubility of Salt A in water is high, (3) the dissolution rate of amorphous Salt A in water, the dissolution rate of a crystal of Salt A in water, and the dissolution rate of a milled crystal of Salt A in water are significantly high, and (4) a preparation containing amorphous Salt A, a crystal of Salt A and/or a milled crystal of Salt A is superior in solubility. More specifically, amorphous Salt A can be produced by lyophilizing an aqueous solution of Salt A. Amorphous Salt A has high solubility and significantly high dissolution rate in water. Thus, a preparation containing amorphous Salt A is superior in solubility and useful as an injectable preparation. A crystal of Salt A can be produced by precipitating a crystal from a solution of Salt A. The crystal has high solubility and significantly high dissolution rate in water. Thus, a preparation containing a crystal of Salt A is superior in solubility and useful as an injectable preparation. Furthermore, a milled crystal of Salt A has high solubility and significantly high dissolution rate in water. Thus, a preparation containing a milled crystal of Salt A is superior in solubility and useful as an injectable preparation. A powder filling method is known as a technique for filling a vial, etc. with a powder. However, in a powder filling method, it is difficult to accurately control the filler content and contamination with minute foreign bodies occurs easily, when compared to a method that divides a solution into small portions. For these reasons, as a process for producing a solid injection, a process by lyophilization is the most reliable process. As a result of intensive studies, the present inventors have found that a lyophilized preparation of a crystal of Salt A having significantly high dissolution rate can be produced in a short crystallization time by controlling the temperature (crystallization temperature) range in a temperature-increasing step after primary freezing in lyophilization. More specifically, a crystal of Salt A can be produced by providing a step of increasing temperature after the primary freezing of lyophilization. The resultant crystal has high solubility in water and significantly high dissolution rate, even though it is not milled. Therefore, the preparation containing the crystal is superior in solubility and useful as an injectable preparation. As a result of intensive studies conducted repeatedly, the present inventors have found that a further superior lyophilized preparation can be produced by adding additives to an aqueous solution of Salt A to be subjected to lyophilization. In such a manner, the present invention has been accomplished. Meanwhile, it is known that a crystalline state changes to an amorphous state when water is removed from the crystal of a hydrate (Yu L., Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews, Vol. 48, page 29, 2001). However, the crystal of Salt A of the present invention does not change to an amorphous state even if a dehydration operation is applied during lyophilization. In addition, a lyophilized preparation of Salt A of the present invention has more superior solubility and much higher stability, compared to the amorphous lyophilized preparation of a sodium salt of Compound A. A superior lyophilized preparation of a crystal of Salt A can be produced according to the process of the present invention. The lyophilized preparation can be easily maintained in aseptic conditions and from which insoluble foreign bodies can be easily removed. Therefore, the lyophilized preparation is an injection superior in usability. More specifically, the present invention is as follows: 1. Salt A or a hydrate thereof. Salt A or a hydrate thereof has high solubility in water and significantly high dissolution rate. 2. A crystal of a Salt A or a hydrate thereof. The crystal has high solubility in water and significantly high dissolution rate. 3. Amorphous Salt A. The amorphous Salt A has high solubility in water and significantly high dissolution rate. 4. An injectable preparation containing Salt A or a hydrate thereof. The injectable preparation is superior in solubility. 5. An injectable preparation containing a crystal of Salt A or a hydrate thereof. The injectable preparation is superior in solubility. 6. An injectable preparation containing an amorphous Salt A or a hydrate thereof. The injectable preparation is superior in solubility. 7. The injectable preparation according to 4 or 5 above, further containing an amino acid and a saccharide, or an amino acid and a sugar alcohol. The injectable preparation is superior in solubility. 8. A lyophilized preparation containing Salt A. The lyophilized preparation is superior in solubility. 9. A lyophilized preparation containing a crystal of Salt A. The lyophilized preparation is superior in solubility. 10. A lyophilized preparation containing amorphous Salt A. The lyophilized preparation is superior in solubility. 11. The lyophilized preparation according to 8 or 9 above, further containing an amino acid and a saccharide, or an amino acid and a sugar alcohol. The lyophilized preparation is superior in solubility. 12. A process for producing a lyophilized preparation containing a crystal of Salt A, including the following steps: (1) cooling an aqueous solution containing Compound A and meglumine to produce a frozen product; (2) increasing the temperature of the frozen product; (3) further cooling the frozen product; and (4) carrying out lyophilization. The process can produce a lyophilized preparation of a crystal of Salt A, which has significantly high dissolution rate, in a short crystallization time. 13. The process according to 12 above, wherein the achieving temperature of the frozen product falls within the range of −20 to −5° C. in the step of increasing the temperature of the frozen product. By setting the temperature of the frozen product so as to fall within the range of −20 to −5° C., a further superior lyophilized preparation of a crystal of Salt A can be produced. Advantages of the Invention Salt A of the present invention is superior in solubility in water and useful as a drug substance of an injectable preparation. Furthermore, a preparation containing Salt A of the present invention is useful as an injectable preparation which is superior in solubility and stability and even satisfactory in appearance. Moreover, the process for producing Salt A of the present invention is useful as a process for producing a lyophilized preparation of a crystal of Salt A which is superior in solubility and stability and even satisfactory in appearance. MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail. Compound A can be produced by a method described, for example, in PATENT DOCUMENT 2. Compound A has a tautomer: 6-fluoro-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2-pyrazinecarboxamide. This tautomer is included in the present invention. Salt A of the present invention and an injectable preparation containing Salt A can be produced, for example, according to the following processes. Process 1: Crystal of Salt A Monohydrate A crystal of Salt A monohydrate can be produced by adding Compound A and meglumine to water, heating the mixture to dissolve, adding 2-propanol and collecting a precipitated crystal by filtration. The amount of water is satisfactorily 1 to 10 times (v/w), and preferably 2 to 4 times (v/w) as large as that of Compound A. The amount of meglumine is satisfactorily 1.0 time (mole) or above, and preferably 1.0 to 1.5 times (mole) as large as that of Compound A. The temperature of the reaction with meglumine is satisfactorily 30 to 100° C. and preferably 40 to 80° C. The amount of 2-propanol is satisfactorily 5 to 50 times (v/w), and preferably 10 to 15 times (v/w) as large as that of Compound A. An injectable preparation can be produced by filling a vial, etc. with the crystal of Salt A monohydrate and/or the milled crystal of Salt A monohydrate thus obtained. Process 2: Crystal of Salt A Anhydrate A crystal of Salt A anhydrate can be produced by allowing a crystal of Salt A monohydrate to stand still at −20 to 60° C. under reduced pressure. The standstill time is satisfactorily 0.5 to 120 hours and preferably 1 to 72 hours. The degree of pressure reduction is not particularly limited; however it is satisfactorily 100 Pa or below and preferably 50 Pa or below. Alternatively, a crystal of Salt A anhydrate can be produced by allowing a crystal of Salt A monohydrate to stand still under heating. The heating temperature is satisfactorily 30° C. or above, preferably 50° C. to 110° C. and more preferably 50° C. to 90° C. An injectable preparation can be produced by filling a vial, etc. with the crystal of Salt A anhydrate and/or the milled crystal of Salt A anhydrate thus obtained. Alternatively, an injectable preparation of a Salt A anhydrate can be produced by grinding the crystal of Salt A monohydrate and then drying it in the same manner as mentioned above. Process 3: Amorphous Salt A (Lyophilization) Amorphous Salt A can be produced by lyophilizing an aqueous solution of Compound A and meglumine. The amount of water is satisfactorily 10 to 100 times (v/w), and preferably 10 to 50 times (v/w) as large as that of Compound A. Meglumine is added such that the pH of the aqueous solution becomes satisfactorily 4.0 to 10 and preferably 7.0 to 9.0. Lyophilization may be performed, for example, by freezing an aqueous solution of Compound A and meglumine at −40° C. or below and maintaining the temperature of the resultant product at a collapse temperature or below. Process 4: Crystal of Salt A (Lyophilization) (1) First Step (Primary Freezing Step) An aqueous solution of Compound A and meglumine can be frozen to obtain an amorphous frozen product. The amount of water is satisfactorily 10 to 100 times (v/w), and preferably 10 to 50 times (v/w) as large as that of Compound A. Meglumine is added such that the pH of the aqueous solution becomes 4.0 to 10 and preferably 7.0 to 9.0. The temperature of the primary freezing step is satisfactorily a collapse temperature or below. In the case of the present invention, the temperature of −60 to −40° C. is preferable. The period of time for the primary freezing step is satisfactorily 1 to 10 hours and preferably 2 to 5 hours. (2) Second Step (Annealing Step) The temperature of the amorphous frozen product is increased and the frozen product is maintained for a preset time (annealing) to allow crystallization to proceed to obtain a crystalline frozen product. The temperature, at which thawing of the frozen product dose not occur and crystallization proceeds to the extent that the frozen product maintains a frozen state, may be satisfactory in the annealing step; preferably −20 to −2° C., more preferably −20 to −5° C., and further preferably −15 to −5° C. The period of time for maintaining the annealing step is satisfactorily 0.5 to 48 hours and preferably 1 to 24 hours. (3) Third Step (Secondary Freezing Step) Subsequently, the crystalline frozen product is cooled again. The temperature of the secondary freezing step is preferably −60 to −30° C. The period of time for the secondary freezing step is satisfactorily 1 to 10 hours and preferably 2 to 5 hours. (4) Fourth Step (Lyophilization Step) Subsequently, pressure reduction treatment can be performed to produce a lyophilized preparation. This step can be performed in accordance with a lyophilization method usually used, for example, in two steps, i.e., a primary drying step and a secondary drying step. The primary drying step is carried out under reduced pressure while product temperature is maintained at the eutectic point or below; however, since the temperature drops as the moisture sublimates from the frozen product, the preset temperature of an apparatus may be the eutectic point or above. The product temperature of the frozen product is satisfactorily −40 to −3° C. and preferably −30 to −5° C. The preset temperature of an apparatus is satisfactorily −20 to 60° C. and preferably −10 to 50° C. The degree of pressure reduction in the primary drying step is not particularly limited; however it is satisfactorily 100 Pa or below and preferably 50 Pa or below. As the amount of sublimating moisture decreases, the rate of temperature decrease becomes slower. As a result, the product temperature increases and becomes almost equal to the preset temperature. Usually, at this time point, the primary drying step is determined to have completed. Subsequently, the secondary drying step is carried out. The secondary drying step is carried out at room temperature or above and preferably 30 to 60° C. In the secondary drying step, the degree of pressure reduction is preferably enhanced in order to accelerate removal of water. The degree of pressure reduction is satisfactorily 0.5 to 10 Pa and preferably 1 to 5 Pa. The secondary drying step may be satisfactorily carried out up until the point where the product temperature becomes almost equal to the preset temperature and a product temperature virtually does not change. The powder X-ray diffraction pattern of a crystal of Salt A produced by the process was the same as the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of a crystal of Salt A anhydrate produced in process 2. More specifically, a lyophilized preparation of a crystal of Salt A anhydrate can be produced by the use of the process. In the process for producing the lyophilized preparation of the present invention, a sterilization treatment or the like may be carried out in accordance with the procedure usually employed. In the process of the present invention, since no organic solvents are used, the lyophilized preparation has no residual solvent.

Comparative Example 2 To a suspension of Compound A (12.0 g) in Water for Injection (70 mL) was added 1 mol/L aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, and the mixture was stirred to dissolve Compound A. Thereafter, 1 mol/L aqueous sodium hydroxide solution was further added to adjust the pH to 8.5. To the solution was added Water for Injection to give a total volume of 160 mL. Thereafter, the mixture was filtered through a 0.22-μm membrane filter to obtain a liquid preparation (pH 8.5). Each vial was filled with the liquid preparation (8 mL), lyophilized and then closed airtight to obtain a lyophilized preparation of an amorphous product. Lyophilization Method 1. Vials were cooled at the shelf temperature of −60° C. to freeze the content. 2. The temperature of the vials was increased to the shelf temperature of 50° C. under vacuum (50 Pa or below) and the vials were maintained at the same pressure and the same temperature for 39 hours. Test Example 1 Solubility To the each vial obtained in Comparative Examples and Examples was added Water for Injection (10 mL) and the vials were shaken by hand. Thus, the dissolution time of the solid substance was measured. The results are shown in Table 3.

The dissolution time of an amorphous sodium salt (Comparative Example 2) was 65 seconds. The dissolution time of a milled crystal of a meglumine salt monohydrate (Example 2) was 5 seconds. The milled crystal of a meglumine salt exhibited more superior solubility than the amorphous sodium salt. The dissolution time of an amorphous meglumine salt (Example 5) was 5 seconds. The amorphous meglumine salt exhibited more superior solubility than the amorphous sodium salt. The dissolution time of preparations (Examples 6 to 9, 41 to 44) produced by lyophilization including an annealing step was 10 to 31 seconds. The preparation produced by this process exhibited more superior solubility than the amorphous sodium salt even though it is not milled. The dissolution time of preparations (Examples 10 to 13) containing amino acids as an additive; preparations (Examples 14 to 19) containing saccharides as an additive; preparations (Examples 20 to 23) containing sugar alcohols as an additive; preparations (Examples 24 to 26) containing salts as an additive; a preparation (Example 27) containing creatinine as an additive, a preparation (Example 28) containing urea as an additive; a preparation (Example 29) containing nicotinic acid amide as an additive; and a preparation (Example 30) containing trometamol as an additive demonstrate that these preparations exhibit much more superior solubility than an amorphous sodium salt. Furthermore, the dissolution time of preparations (Examples 31 to 34, 45, 46, 49 to 59, 64 to 68) containing amino acids and saccharides, and preparations (Examples 35 to 40, 47, 60 to 63) containing amino acids and sugar alcohols all fall within the range of 10 seconds and thus exhibited extremely superior solubility. Test Example 2 Appearance Appearance was observed. As a result, lyophilized preparations of Examples 7 and 8 looked uniform without a melting mark. Furthermore, the preparations of Examples 12, 15, 27, 31 to 33, 36, 38, 51, 55 and 59 were uniform cakes without a melting mark. The surface of the preparations was smooth and appearance was more satisfactory. Lyophilized preparations having more preferable appearance were obtained by blending additives. Test Example 3 Stability (1) The lyophilized preparations of Examples 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, 20, 23, 31, 32, 36 and 40 were allowed to stand still at 40° C. for 6 months and then checked for appearance and residual ratio of Compound A. As a result, appearance change and reduction of the content of Compound A were not observed. Test Example 4 Stability (2) The lyophilized preparations of Examples 69 and Comparative Example 1 were irradiated (1,200,000 lx·hr) by a D65 lamp (FLR20S-D-EDL-D65/M) and then their appearance was observed. As a result, appearance change was not observed in the preparation of Example 69; whereas the preparation of Comparative Example 1 turned into orange-yellow.
