These disclosures are incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure generally relates to a multicarboxylate, such as an alkyl alkoxy dicarboxylate or an alkylaryl carboxylate and a method of making the multicarboxylate. In particular embodiments, the present disclosure concerns an alkoxy multicarboxylate compound, a method of making such a compound, and methods of using the compound in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications. BACKGROUND Alkoxy carboxylates have been used as surfactant additives in a variety of settings, such as in shampoos, laundry detergents, and liquid dish washing compositions. These carboxylic acid compositions have additional potential application as oil additives, such as in marine engines, and in situations where water emulsion formation can occur. They may also have cosmetic applications in combination with Guerbet esters which are highly valued cosmetic esters for their exceptional emolliency properties in skin and body creams. Additionally, alkoxy carboxylates are used in tertiary oil recovery processes. However, all such alkoxy carboxylates have only included one carboxylate group. Reservoir systems, such as petroleum reservoirs, typically contain fluids such as water and a mixture of hydrocarbons such as oil and gas. To remove (“produce”) the hydrocarbons from the reservoir, different mechanisms can be utilized such as primary, secondary or tertiary recovery processes. In a primary recovery process, hydrocarbons are displaced from a reservoir through the high natural differential pressure between the reservoir and the bottom hole pressure within a wellbore. The reservoir's energy and natural forces drive the hydrocarbons contained in the reservoir into the production well and up to the surface. Artificial lift systems, such as sucker rod pumps, electrical submersible pumps or gas-lift systems, are often implemented in the primary production stage to reduce the bottom hole pressure within the well. Such systems increase the differential pressure between the reservoir and the wellbore intake; thus, increasing hydrocarbon production. However, even with use of such artificial lift systems only a small fraction of the original-oil-in-place (OOIP) is typically recovered using primary recovery processes as the reservoir pressure, and the differential pressure between the reservoir and the wellbore intake declines over time due to production. For example, typically only about 10-20% of the OOIP can be produced before primary recovery reaches its limit, either when the reservoir pressure is so low that the production rates are not economical or when the proportions of gas or water in the production stream are too high. In order to increase the production life of the reservoir, secondary or tertiary recovery processes can be used. Secondary recovery processes include water or gas well injection, while tertiary methods are based on injecting additional chemical compounds into the well, such as surfactants and polymers. Typically in these processes, fluids are injected into the reservoir to maintain reservoir pressure and drive the hydrocarbons to producing wells. An additional 10-50% of OOIP can be produced through tertiary recovery processes in addition to the oil produced during primary recovery. While surfactants can be used as wetting agents, emulsifiers, detergents and solubilizers, they are also utilized in various stages of hydrocarbon recovery and processing, such as in drilling operations (e.g., drilling fluids/dispersants), reservoir injection (e.g., fracturing fluids, enhanced oil recovery fluids), well productivity (e.g., acidizing fluids), hydrocarbon transportation, environmental remediation, or a combination thereof. Alkylaryl carboxylates have been used as enhanced oil recovery surfactants, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,269,881, incorporated herein in full by reference, with one carboxylate group. There is a need for improved additive compositions for use in EOR applications.

Uses: Compositions of the disclosure can be used as wetting agents, oil additives, lubricants, emulsifiers, detergents, cosmetics, stabilizers, and solubilizers. They may also be utilized in various stages of hydrocarbon recovery and processing, such as in drilling operations (e.g., drilling fluids/dispersants), reservoir injection (e.g., fracturing fluids, recovery fluids), well productivity (e.g., acidizing fluids), hydrocarbon transportation, environmental remediation, polymer damage remediation, or a combination thereof. Chemically Enhanced Oil Recovery Methods: As used herein and unless indicated otherwise, “multicarboxylate” refers to both alkoxy multicarboxylate and alkylaryl multicarboxylate. In one embodiment, the multicarboxylate composition is used as a surfactant in a chemically enhanced oil recovery (CEOR) process. In another embodiment, the multicarboxylate additive functions as a stabilizer in a CEOR process. In one embodiment, the multicarboxylate composition functions as a stabilizer in polymer flooding with brine solutions containing a high concentration of divalent cations, e.g., greater than 500 ppm, and for temperatures greater than 70° C., even when employed in an amount less than 2000 ppm (0.2%). In another embodiment a stabilizer, the multicarboxylate is used in an amount ranging from 200 ppm (0.02%) to 1500 ppm (0.15%). Polymer flooding refers to injection streams containing any of associative polymers, water soluble unhydrolyzed polyacrylamides, or partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamides (PHPA) and with very little if any surfactant (<100 ppm). Polymer flooding can be by itself (e.g., alkaline polymer slug or AP slug), or as part of sequence of a polymer flooding slug followed by, or following, a polymer surfactant flooding (e.g., alkaline surfactant polymer or ASP slug). The polymer forms precipitates in hard brine and at temperatures >70° C., thereby limiting the application of polyacrylamides in polymer flooding at moderately high temperatures and hard brines due to plugging of the formation. Hard brines are defined as solutions containing >500 ppm of divalent ions. The only method to deploy PHPA under conditions of up to 100° C. is to remove divalent ions content. The use of the multicarboxylate composition as a stabilizer obviates the formation of precipitates in the injection stream, e.g., for the injection stream to have an NTU<20. In one embodiment for use as a surfactant, the aqueous stream composition comprises 0.3-10% by weight of the multicarboxylate. In another embodiment, the CEOR composition comprises 0.5% to 5% by weight of the multicarboxylate as a surfactant. In yet another embodiment, the CEOR composition comprises 0.01% to 20% by weight of the multicarboxylate as a surfactant. In yet another embodiment, the CEOR composition comprises less than 1% by weight of the multicarboxylate as a surfactant. The alkoxy carboxylate composition is suitable for CEOR composition when used in high temperature reservoirs, such as reservoirs above 55° C. The alkoxy carboxylate composition can be tailored to the conditions of the reservoir needing enhanced oil recovery. For example, the compound or the amount of the compound can be adjusted depending on the type of reservoir or the polymer used for the EOR application. In one embodiment, the length and branching of the alcohol portion can be decreased or increased, the length and ratio of each BO, EO, PO portions can be decreased or increased, and the length and positioning of the carboxylate surfactant portion may also be increased or decreased depending on the reservoir properties. In another embodiment, the components EO's (CH2-CH2-O) and PO's (CH(CH3)-CH2-O can be varied depending on the polymer selected for the injection stream. FIG. 1 is an example oil recovery system which includes injection well 11 which extends to a portion of a subsurface reservoir 13 containing hydrocarbons for production, such that injection well 11 is in fluid communication with subsurface reservoir 13 and the hydrocarbons. Production well 15 is also in fluid communication with reservoir 13 in order to receive the hydrocarbons. Production well 15 is positioned a lateral distance away from injection well 11. For example, production well 15 can be positioned between 50 feet to 10,000 feet away from injection well 11. There can be additional production wells (not shown) at predetermined locations to optimally receive the hydrocarbons being pushed through reservoir 13 due to injections from additional injection wells (not shown). In an embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 1, a first surfactant-polymer (SP) slug 17 is injected through the injection well 11 into reservoir 13. The first SP slug 17 may be preceded by a pre-flush, such as a pre-flush of softened water at any desired salinity and/or by a polymer flood. As described further below, the SP slug comprises at least a carboxylate surfactant. The first SP slug 17 disperses through reservoir 13, with at least a portion thereof proceeding toward production well 15. A driver, chaser, or polymer drive slug 21 may be injected through the injection well into the reservoir after the SP slug 17, as illustrated in FIG. 2. The polymer used in the chaser slug 21 can be the same polymer used in the SP slug or may be different. In one embodiment, multiple chaser slugs can be injected. For example, a first chaser slug containing a small amount of polymer can be injected and the followed by a second chaser slug containing a larger amount of polymer. For each reservoir operation, the optimal slug volumes may be determined prior to injection. For example, the SP slugs may be injected into the reservoir in volumes of between 0.05 to 0.5 PV, 0.1 to 0.4 PV, or about 0.1 PV. The necessary slug size can be determined through core flooding experiments and simulation. The volume of SP slug 17 may be the equal to, or different from the volume of the chaser. The speed of injection of the slugs may also vary depending on the reservoir operations. The methods of the disclosure may be performed on-shore or off-shore, and may be adjusted to make the most efficient use of the location. As an example, seawater may be used as an aqueous base for any of the slugs described here, since off-shore production facilities tend to have an abundance of seawater available, limited storage space, and transportation costs to and from off-shore site are typically high. If seawater is used as the aqueous base, it can be softened prior to the addition of the alkali, polymer and/or surfactant, thereby removing any multivalent ions, specifically Mg and Ca. Additionally, the alkali, polymer, and surfactants may be added to an aqueous base fluid in a solid form or in a solution. Solid forms may be put into solution prior to addition to the production fluid or the solid form may be directly added to the production fluid. Embodiments of the disclosure can be practiced in high temperature reservoirs, for example, greater than 50° C., greater than 55° C., greater than 60° C., greater than 65° C., greater than 70° C., greater than 80° C., or greater than 90° C. In some embodiments, the temperature of the reservoir is 15° C. to over 100° C. Polymer: At least one polymer may be included with the multicarboxylate additive in the CEOR composition, to control the mobility of the CEOR composition when injected into a reservoir for enhanced oil recovery. Suitable polymers include, but are not limited to, biopolymers such as xanthan gum and scleroglucan and synthetic polymers such as water soluble unhydrolyzed or partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamides (HPAMs or PHPAs) and hydrophobically-modified associative polymers (APs). Also included are co-polymers of polyacrylamide (PAM) and one or both of 2-acrylamido 2-methylpropane sulfonic acid (and/or sodium salt) sold under the trademark AMPS (also more generally known as acrylamido tertiobutyl sulfonic acid or ATBS) and N-vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP). Molecular weights (Mw) of the polymers range from about 100,000 Daltons to about 30,000,000 Daltons, such as about 100,000 to about 500,000, or about 1,000,000 to about 20,000,000 Daltons. In specific embodiments of the disclosure the polymer is about 2,000,000 Daltons, about 8,000,000 Daltons, or about 20,000,000 Daltons. The polymer and the size of the polymer may be tailored to the permeability, temperature and salinity of the reservoir. When the CEOR composition is injected as a slug into a subterranean reservoir, effective amounts of polymer are concentrations that allow the slug to efficiently sweep the reservoir. The required viscosity is a function of mobility ratio. Mobility ratio (M) is defined as water (or ASP) relative permeability divided by oil relative permeability multiplied by oil viscosity divided by water (or ASP) viscosity (krw/kro*μo/μw). Generally a unit mobility ratio, M=1, or lower is desired in an ASP flood. In one example, the effective amount of polymer added to each slug is sufficient to reduce the viscosity of each subsequent slug, in order obtain favorable mobility ratio throughout the entire flood process. For example, effective amounts of polymer include, but are not limited to about 250 ppm to about 5,000 ppm, such as about 500 to about 2500 ppm concentration, or about 750 to 3000 ppm in order to achieve a favorable mobility ratio under the reservoir conditions of temperature. Different slugs may comprise different amounts of polymer. Optional Surfactant: Surfactants may be included in the CEOR composition, along with the multicarboxylate additive, to lower the interfacial tension between the oil and water phase to less than about 0.01 dyne/cm (for example) and thereby recover additional oil by mobilizing and solubilizing oil trapped by capillary forces. In one embodiment, an SP slug is prepared by combining a polymer with a multicarboxylate additive and 0.1-15% by weight of at least a surfactant that is not a multicarboxylate. Examples of surfactants that can be utilized include, but are not limited to, anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, non-ionic surfactants, or a combination thereof. Anionic surfactants can include sulfates, sulfonates, phosphates, or other carboxylates. Such anionic surfactants are known and described in the art in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,770,641, which is incorporated herein by reference. Examples of specific anionic surfactants include internal olefin sulfonates, isomerized olefin sulfonates, alkyl aryl sulfonates, medium alcohol (C10 to C36) alkoxy sulfates, alcohol ether [alkoxy] single carboxylates, and alcohol ether [alkoxy]sulfates. Example cationic surfactants include primary, secondary, or tertiary amines, or quaternary ammonium cations. Example amphoteric surfactants include cationic surfactants that are linked to a terminal sulfonate or carboxylate group. Example non-ionic surfactants include other alcohol alkoxylates such as alkylaryl alkoxy alcohols or alkyl alkoxy alcohols. Other non-ionic surfactants can include alkyl alkoxylated esters and alkyl polyglycosides. In some embodiments, multiple non-ionic surfactants such as non-ionic alcohols or non-ionic esters are combined. As a skilled artisan may appreciate, the surfactant(s) selection may vary depending upon such factors as salinity, temperature, and clay content in the reservoir. The surfactants can be injected in any manner such as continuously or in a batch process. Alkali Additives: Depending on the type of reservoir, alkali may be included in the SP flood, making it an alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP) flood. In one embodiment, the alkali employed is a basic salt of an alkali metal from Group IA metals of the Periodic Table, such as an alkali metal hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate. In one embodiment, the alkali is selected from the group consisting of sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium silicate, tetrasodium EDTA, sodium metaborate, sodium citrate, and sodium tetraborate. The alkali may be used in amounts ranging from about 0.3 to about 5 weight percent of the solution, such as about 0.5 to about 3 weight percent. As previously discussed, use of the alkali maintains surfactant in a high pH environment, which can minimize surfactant adsorption. Alkali can also protect the surfactant from hardness. Using alkali before and after an ASP slug can help to minimize surfactant adsorption, as a high pH environment is maintained through any diffusion of an ASP slug. Additional Additives: The CEOR composition may also include additional additives, such as chelators, co-solvents, reducing agents/oxygen scavengers, and biocides. Chelators may be used to complex with multivalent cations and soften the water in the solution. Examples of chelators include ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) which can also be used as an alkali, methylglycinediacetic acid (MGDA). Chelants may be utilized to handle hard brines. The amount of chelant may be selected based on the amount of divalent ions in the slug solutions. For example, chelating agents can be used a 10:1 molar ratio with divalent cations such as calcium or magnesium or barium. Other chelating agents may work depending on the brine composition and the desired pH. Suitable co-solvents may be selected from lower carbon chain alcohols like isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, n-propyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, sec-butyl alcohol, n-amyl alcohol, sec-amyl alcohol, n-hexyl alcohol, sec-hexyl alcohol and the like; alcohol ethers, polyalkylene alcohol ethers, polyalkylene glycols, poly(oxyalkylene)glycols, poly(oxyalkylene)glycols ethers or any other common organic co-solvent or combinations of any two or more co-solvents. For example, in an embodiment, an ether, ethylene glycol butyl ether (EGBE), is used and may be about 0.75 to 1.5 times the concentration of surfactant of ASP slug 21. Co-solvents, when used, may be present in an amount of about 0.5 to about 6.0 weight percent of the solution, such as from about 0.5 to about 4.0 weight percent, or about 0.5 to about 3 weight percent. Reducing agents/oxygen scavengers such as sodium dithionite may be used to remove any oxygen in the mixture and reduce any free iron into Fe2+. They can be used to protect synthetic polymers from reactions that cleave the polymer molecule and lower or remove viscosifying abilities. A reduced environment can also lower surfactant adsorption. Biocides can be used to prevent organic (algal) growth in facilities, stop sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) growth which “sour” the reservoir by producing dangerous and deadly H2S, and are also used to protect biopolymers from biological life which feed on their sugar-like structures and therefore remove mobility control. Biocides include aldehydes and quaternary ammonium compounds. EXAMPLES The following illustrative examples are intended to be non-limiting. Example 1 Alkoxy Dicarboxylate Synthesis An alkoxy dicarboxylate is prepared using a two-step procedure. A sodium chloro acid salt is synthesized from a chloro acid compound comprising two carboxylates, such as a succinate. This reaction is conducted in a separate glass vessel with the product dried prior to addition to the surfactant step. The sodium chloro acetate group is then added to the alkyl alkoxy alcohol. This step synthesizes the alkoxy dicarboxylate surfactants. The process involves reacting alkyl alkoxy alcohols, for example, with a strong base to generate an anion on the alkoxy alcohol (loss of H+ to strong base) which then displaces the chloride group from the added sodium chloro carboxylic salt to insert the carboxylate groups on to the alkoxy alcohol. The chemical mechanism for the reaction is an SN2 displacement. The reaction operating conditions range from room temperature to 150° C. at from 0 to 10 inches of mercury vacuum. The reactor for the second step has electronic controls for temperature and vacuum control with manual valves for gas blanketing. The reactants are charged to the reactor prior to heating. A cold trap is used to collect the tertiary butanol that is formed by the strong base as well as solvents to keep the reactants in solution. All electrical equipment is plugged into a temperature controller that is powered by a hood receptacle. The vacuum is controlled by a vacuum system monitor. Example 2 Alkoxy Dicarboxylate Synthesis In this example, 1.1 moles of potassium tert-butoxide is reacted with 1 mole of alkyl ethoxylate propoxylate C10-18 alcohol at 45° C. for 1 hour while stirring at reduced pressure of 17 mm Hg. Tertiary butanol that is pulled off is collected in a dry ice/acetone trap. Then, 1.1 moles of sodium chlorosuccinate dissolved in 100 mL DMSO is added to the alkyl ethoxylate propoxylate C10-18 alcohol/potassium t-butoxide mixture. The reaction temperature is increased to 90° C. and the pressure again reduced to about 17 mm Hg. The reaction mixture is stirred under these conditions over night or until liquid is no longer being collected in the dry ice/acetone mixture. The alkyl ethoxy propoxy succinate is isolated by ether and water extraction. The % conversion is greater than 90%. Example 3 Alkoxy Multicarboxylate Synthesis An alkoxy multicarboxylate is prepared using a two-step procedure. A sodium chloro multi-acid salt reagent is synthesized from a chloro acid compound. This reaction is conducted in a separate glass vessel with the product dried prior to addition to the surfactant step. A sodium chloro multicarboxylate group is then added to the alkyl alkoxy alcohol. This step synthesizes the alkoxy multicarboxylate surfactants. The process involves reacting alkyl alkoxy alcohols with a strong base to generate an anion on the alkoxy alcohol (loss of H+ to strong base) which then displaces the chloride group from the added sodium chloro multicarboxylic salt to insert the carboxylate groups. The chemical mechanism for the reaction is an SN2 displacement. The reaction operating conditions ranges from room temperature to 150° C. at from 0 to 10 inches of mercury vacuum. The reactor for the second step has electronic controls for temperature and vacuum control with manual valves for gas blanketing. The reactants are then charged to the reactor prior to heating. A cold trap is used to collect the tertiary butanol that is formed by the strong base as well as solvents to keep the reactants in solution. All electrical equipment is plugged into a temperature controller that is powered by a hood receptacle. The vacuum is controlled by a vacuum system monitor. Example 4 Alkoxy Tricarboxylate Synthesis In this example, 1.1 moles of potassium tert-butoxide is reacted with 1 mole of alkyl ethoxylate propoxylate C10-18 alcohol at 45° C. for 1 hour while stirring at reduced pressure of 17 mm Hg. Tertiary butanol that is pulled off is collected in a dry ice/acetone trap. Then, 1.1 moles of sodium chloro 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylate dissolved in 100 mL DMSO is added to the alkyl ethoxylate propoxylate C10-18 alcohol/potassium t-butoxide mixture. The reaction temperature is increased to 90° C. and the pressure again reduced to about 17 mm Hg. The reaction mixture is stirred under these conditions over night or until liquid is no longer being collected in the dry ice/acetone mixture. The alkyl ethoxy propoxy tricarboxylate is isolated by ether and water extraction. The % conversion is greater than 90%. Example 5 Alkoxy Tetracarboxylate Synthesis In this example, 1.1 moles of potassium tert-butoxide is reacted with 1 mole of alkyl ethoxylate propoxylate C10-18 alcohol at 45° C. for 1 hour while stirring at reduced pressure of 17 mm Hg. Tertiary butanol that is pulled off is collected in a dry ice/acetone trap. Then, 1.1 moles of sodium chloro 1,1,2,3-propanetetracarboxylate dissolved in 100 mL DMSO is added to the alkyl ethoxylate propoxylate C10-18 alcohol/potassium t-butoxide mixture. The reaction temperature is increased to 90° C. and the pressure again reduced to about 17 mm Hg. The reaction mixture is stirred under these conditions over night or until liquid is no longer being collected in the dry ice/acetone mixture. The alkly ethoxy propoxy tetracarboxylate is isolated by ether and water extraction. The % conversion is greater than 90%. Example 6 Alkylaryl Multicarboxylate Synthesis An alkylaryl multicarboxylate is synthesized as follows. A slight excess of (1.1 moles base:1 mole of substituted phenol) potassium t-butoxide is reacted with a guerbet/phenol compound at about 45° C. under reduced pressure of 17 mm Hg for 2 hours. Tertiary butanol is removed and collected in a dry ice/isopropanol trap. Then a slight excess (1.1:1, for example) of chloro multicarboxylate (e.g. succinate) is added to the phenol mixture. The reaction temperature is increased to about 90° C. at a pressure of less than or equal to 17 mm Hg pressure overnight. The multicarboxylate material is separated by lowering the solution pH to about 3 with acid solution and heating the mixture to 90° C. The upper layer of the resulting mixture is collected. Changing the pH to about 8 with NaOH yields the salt form of the multicarboxylate. Example 7 Analysis of Dicarboxylate A sample of dicarboxylate was synthesized as described above. The product from the reaction of both chloro acetate or chloro succinate with a nonionic alkoxy alcohol yield products with either one (acetate) or two acid (succinate) terminal groups. IR (4000-600 Wavenumbers transmittance): The acetate product has a broad carbonyl singlet shifted to lower wavenumbers indicating a lowering of bond strength. However, the succinate product has doublet carbonyl peak. One peak of the doublet is close to the starting chloro succinate while the second is at a lower wavenumber similar to the acetate product. The doublet may also indicate the proximity of the alkoxy groups to one acid group vs. the second or terminal acid group. HPLC (Column: Zorbax SB-C8 4.6×250 mm, 5 um, Mobil Phase: 90% H2O, 10% acetonitrile, 8 gm phosphorus acid, Detector: Agilent Diode Array Detector G4212A/B): The product from the chloro acetate reaction is shifted by 1.5 minutes to shorter retention on the column indicating less chromatographic separation with the polar mobile phase than the chloro acetate reactant. The chloro succinate product has a similar retention time to the acetate product due to the presence of the alkoxy groups which affects the chromatographic separation more than the addition of a second acid group. However, the product retention time is only 0.6 minutes shorter than the chloro succinate reactant indicating that the two acid groups are separated even less with the polar mobile phase. Both the IR and HPLC results indicate that an alcohol alkoxylated dicarboxylate is synthesized using the described methods. Example 8 Comparative Example A solution of hard brine (containing >500 ppm) containing partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PHPA) at a concentration of 2000 ppm and at a temperature of >70° C. is provided. It is observed that PHPA in the presence of >500 ppm divalent ions forms a solid precipitate (flocculates) in solution, with NTU>20. If this hard brine containing PHPA is used for in polymer flooding at moderately high temperatures, it is expected to plug the formation. Example 9 Comparative Example Example 8 is repeated except the PHPA concentration is 1000 ppm. It is observed that solid precipitate (flocculates) still forms in the solution, with NTU>20. Example 10 Comparative Example Example 8 is repeated, except that the divalent ions content is removed (to be less than 100 ppm) prior to the addition of PHPA. No precipitate is formed. NTU is <20. Example 11 Addition of Stabilizer Example 8 is repeated with field brines at 120° C. under anaerobic conditions (solutions degassed and sealed in glass ampoules) with several divalent chelating chemicals. No precipitation occurred (and NTU<20) with the addition of alkoxylated carboxylate as an additive for 9 hours at 120° C. The additive has a formula of R(28 carbons)-O—(CH2-CH2-O)25-COO—Na+. The concentrations of the surfactant were 0.15% (1500 ppm) and 0.05% (500 ppm). These surfactant concentrations are much lower than the same surfactant used in a surfactant oil flood which ranges from 1-2%.
