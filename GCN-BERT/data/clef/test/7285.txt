PRIORITY DATA This patent application is a non-provisional patent application claiming priority to U.S. Provisional Patent App. No. 61/970,250, filed on Mar. 25, 2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein. FIELD The present invention generally relates to biorefining processes for converting biomass into xylitol and other products. BACKGROUND Lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant renewable material on the planet and has long been recognized as a potential feedstock for producing chemicals, fuels, and materials. Lignocellulosic biomass normally comprises primarily cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Cellulose and hemicellulose are natural polymers of sugars, and lignin is an aromatic/aliphatic hydrocarbon polymer reinforcing the entire biomass network. Xylitol is a five-carbon sugar alcohol that can be found in nature in small quantities. It has attracted global attention because of its sweetening power similar to that of sucrose, but provides much fewer calories. Xylitol is also known to be metabolized through insulin-independent pathways in human body and therefore it can be used as sugar substitute for diabetics. Currently, xylitol is industrially produced by chemical hydrogenation of xylose-containing hemicellulosic hydrolysate in the presence of a metal catalyst under high temperature and pressure However, this chemical process is costly and energy-intensive; in addition, there is also a need for a complex purification and separation process. In order to produce xylitol in a more environmental-friendly manner, research has been conducted on alternative strategies that utilize microorganisms for conversion of xylose-to-xylitol from hemicelluloses (Prakasham et al., “Current trends in biotechnological production of xylitol and future prospects,” Curr. Trends Biotechnol. Pharm. 3, 8-36, 2009; Granström, et al., “A rare sugar xylitol. Part I: the biochemistry and biosynthesis of xylitol,” Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 74, 277-281, 2007). Improved processes to produce and recover xylitol are needed commercially. SUMMARY The present invention addresses the aforementioned needs in the art. In some variations, the invention provides a process for producing ethanol and xylitol from lignocellulosic biomass, the process comprising: (a) extracting hemicelluloses from a feedstock comprising lignocellulosic biomass, wherein the hemicelluloses include xylose oligomers and other sugar oligomers;(b) hydrolyzing the xylose oligomers and the other sugar oligomers, using an acid catalyst or enzymes, to generate xylose and other sugar monomers, respectively;(c) fermenting the other sugar monomers to ethanol using a suitable ethanol-producing microorganism;(d) optionally removing at least some of the ethanol;(e) fermenting the xylose to xylitol using a suitable xylitol-producing microorganism;(f) recovering the ethanol, derived from step (c) and/or, if conducted, step (d); and(g) recovering the xylitol derived from step (e).

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS This description will enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and it describes several embodiments, adaptations, variations, alternatives, and uses of the invention. These and other embodiments, features, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent to those skilled in the art when taken with reference to the following detailed description of the invention in conjunction with any accompanying drawings. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an,” and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All composition numbers and ranges based on percentages are weight percentages, unless indicated otherwise. All ranges of numbers or conditions are meant to encompass any specific value contained within the range, rounded to any suitable decimal point. Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing parameters, reaction conditions, concentrations of components, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about.” Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending at least upon a specific analytical technique. The term “comprising,” which is synonymous with “including,” “containing,” or “characterized by” is inclusive or open-ended and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps. “Comprising” is a term of art used in claim language which means that the named claim elements are essential, but other claim elements may be added and still form a construct within the scope of the claim. As used herein, the phase “consisting of” excludes any element, step, or ingredient not specified in the claim. When the phrase “consists of” (or variations thereof) appears in a clause of the body of a claim, rather than immediately following the preamble, it limits only the element set forth in that clause; other elements are not excluded from the claim as a whole. As used herein, the phase “consisting essentially of” limits the scope of a claim to the specified elements or method steps, plus those that do not materially affect the basis and novel characteristic(s) of the claimed subject matter. With respect to the terms “comprising,” “consisting of,” and “consisting essentially of,” where one of these three terms is used herein, the presently disclosed and claimed subject matter may include the use of either of the other two terms. Thus in some embodiments not otherwise explicitly recited, any instance of “comprising” may be replaced by “consisting of” or, alternatively, by “consisting essentially of.” The present invention, in some variations, is premised on the realization that an important aspect of commercial production of xylitol is the ability to achieve high concentration of its precursor, xylose. By first fermenting other sugars to ethanol or other products, or by co-fermenting a sugar solution under conditions in which the other sugars (besides xylose) are fermented faster than xylose, the xylose concentration can be enriched. When such xylose is then fermented to xylitol, it will be in relatively high concentration for more efficient separation and purification. For example if half the initial sugars are xylose and half are C6 sugars, completely fermenting the C6 sugars and optionally removing the products, means that the xylose purity doubles. Even accounting from some non-fermented C5 or C6 sugars, the xylose purity may increase from ˜40% to ˜80% of the sugars present, for example. Certain exemplary embodiments of the invention will now be described. These embodiments are not intended to limit the scope of the invention as claimed. The order of steps may be varied, some steps may be omitted, and/or other steps may be added. Reference herein to first step, second step, etc. is for illustration purposes only.

The process further comprises, in preferred embodiments, removing lignin derived from the lignocellulosic biomass. The lignin may be removed during hemicellulose hydrolysis, or following such step. Lignin removal may be integrated with removal of ethanol or other C6 fermentation product, to increase purity of xylitol. The biomass feedstock may be selected from hardwoods, softwoods, forest residues, industrial wastes, pulp and paper wastes, consumer wastes, or combinations thereof.
