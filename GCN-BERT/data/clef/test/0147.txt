BIOCOMPOSITES AND METHODS OF MAKING THE SAME FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0001] In general, the present invention is related to biopolymer and biocomposite materials and structures, and methods of making and using the same. In some embodiments, the present invention is directed to oriented collagen based biocomposite materials and structures, and methods of making. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0001a] Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field. [0002] Collagen gels, bandages, sponges and fibers have been used as carriers for stem cells. Collagen is a natural protein present in many tissues. It supplies tensile strength to the tissues as well as providing attachment sites for cells to bind, migrate and proliferate. However, collagen gels and pulverized collagen lack tensile strength and tend to dissipate in the tissue under pressure and thus are not well suited to the task of maintaining cells in defined locations. [0003] Collagen can be isolated in pure form from a variety of tissues as a soluble protein which can be reconstituted into fibers. In general, fibers lack the superstructure they exhibit in different tissues. This has limited the success of using collagen in many medical applications. [0004] Tissue damage to heart, striated muscle, skin, bone and cartilage, spinal cord, etc. often progresses and causes the breakdown of normal surrounding tissue increasing the area damaged and seriously impairing tissue function. Current concepts suggest that various factors or cells could be introduced into the damaged area by direct injection to prevent further damage and even restore the damaged area. Indeed, preclinical as well as clinical trials have shown improved heart function when mesenchymal stem cells are injected into the site of tissue damage. However, such studies have also shown that significant amounts of the injected cells leak out of the tissue and most of the cells remaining rapidly die. Thus there is a need for devices which allow delivery of various types of cells to specific sites in damaged tissue and maintain their survival and expansion. However, the physical properties of different tissues vary strikingly (compare heart muscle with striated muscle with skin or spinal cord. Thus, delivery vehicles should have sufficient strength to allow them to be placed in a specific tissue without causing alterations in tissue function due to poorly matched physical factors. This calls for materials whose physical properties are suitable for the tissue in which they are to be used. Also, cells require factors and surfaces to support their survival, migration and production of specific repair factors. In brief, the treatment of damaged tissues should be improved by novel devices which would deliver and maintain stem and other cells in specific sites to allow them to survive and produce factors that sustain tissue at risk. [0005] Tendon and ligament injuries are among the most common health problems affecting the adult population. It is estimated that 175,000 Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstructions were performed in the year 2000 in the United States at a cost of more than $2 billion. There are 50,000 patients requiring surgical repair of rotator cuff and 5 million new cases of tennis elbow each year in the United States alone. In addition, 11% of regular runners suffer from Achilles tendinopathy. In 2000, treatments for shoulder pain cost the United States government up to $7 billion and the total cost for tendon and ligament injury has been estimated at $30 billion annually; see Chen, J., Xu J., Wang A., Zheng Μ., 2009. Scaffolds for tendon and ligament repair: review of the efficacy of commercial products. Expert Rev. Med. Devices. 6. 1:61-73. [0006] Current methods to repair tendon and ligaments of the hand and foot have had only limited success. In some cases, the joints are immobilized for four weeks while scar tissue builds up. This scar tissue, which has poor mechanical properties, must assume the function of the original tendon/ligament but has a high rate of failure. In other cases non-absorbable sutures anchored to bone are used. These sutures lack the appropriate elasticity and often evoke an immune response. In other cases, repair is not possible and the replacement procedures available have various limitations. [0007] Current clinical and research practice utilizes animal and human grafts as the primary material in daily clinical practice to repair tendon and ligament defects. Biological substitutes include autografts, allografts, and xenografts. [0008] Autologous grafts of patellar tendon and hamstring tendons are considered the “gold standard” in tissue repair and are usually preferred to avoid rejection. However, these autografts suffer from a number of disadvantages. For example, autografts require additional surgery on the patient which may cause donor site morbidity, increased recovery time, and/or possible pain at the harvesting site plus harvest site infection, nerve injury, and patellar fracture. An additional disadvantage in the use of the hamstring tendon for ACL reconstruction is the lack of efficient tendon-bone healing, which affects patient recovery due to instability of the tendon-bone interface. [0009] Allografts are obtained from tendons, dermis and other tissues of cadavers. Xenografts are harvested from animal tendons, small intestine submucosa, dermis and skin, and pericardium. Allografts and xenografts are primarily composed of type I collagen with similar mechanical properties to human tendons. However, alio- and xenografts can potentially transmit disease or infection, and may elicit an unfavorable immunogenic response from the host. [0010] Synthetic grafts exhibit excellent short-term results but the long-term clinical outcome is poor, with a failure rate of 40 to 78% from fragmentation, stress shielding of new tissue, fatigue, creep, and wear debris, which can eventually lead to arthritis and synovitis. [0011] Current cell-seeding techniques include: a) delivering cell-gel composites into the region of the scaffold and b) delivering cell suspensions into scaffolds in a static or dynamic situation. However, there are some disadvantages to these techniques, such as the low efficiency of cell attachment to dense fibrous matrix or scaffolds and the weak mechanical strength of gel systems. These disadvantages make it very difficult to seed a significant number of cells on dense tissue grafts. Thus the limitations of current technology prohibit the use of stem cells to improve the efficiency of large tissue grafts for tissue repair. To address these limitations partial thickness incisions and ultrasonication were developed to allow the seeded cells to infiltrate the tendon in culture prior to implantation. Without incisions or ultrasonication, extrinsic cells seeded onto the tendon surface have difficulty penetrating the tendon. However, with incision and ultrasonication, the mechanical strength of the grafts is reduced which limits the potential of clinical application. [0012] Several research groups have attempted to tissue engineer neo-ligaments in vitro for tendon and ligament replacements as described in Hairfield-Stein Μ. et al. 2007. Development of Self-Assembled, Tissue-Engineered Ligament from Bone Marrow Stromal Cells. Tissue Engineering. 13. 4:703-710. One of the first promising results in this direction has been published by Goldstein JD et al. in Goldstein, JD, et al. 1989. Development of a Reconstituted Collagen Tendon Prosthesis. The Journal of Bone and Joins Surgery. 71. A. 8: 1183-1191; and Dunn et al. Dunn, MG. et al. 1992. Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using a composite collagenous prosthesis. A biomechanical & histological rabbit study. Am J Sports Med. 20. 507-515. Constructed scaffolds of collagen fibers are bundled in different configurations with and without a collagen gel to hold them together. Dunn et al. and other groups used collagen scaffolds with and without seeded cells. The main problems of this approach have been: a) the rate of degradation of scaffold collagen was higher than the rate of newly synthesized collagen causing the neo-ligament to fail to support in vivo loading; and b) the cost of production was too high and reproducibility was low. [0013] To reduce the rate of degradation, several research groups have used silk and other synthetic materials. This solved the enzymatic degradation problem but generated other problems including immune reactions, fibrosis, and wear debris. Attempts to eliminate extracellular matrix scaffolds have led to a new approach of so-called “functional tissueengineering” or “spontaneous 3-dimensional tissue development” as described in Calve, S., Dennis RG, Kosnik PE, Baar Κ, Grosh Κ, Arruda EM. 2004. Engineering of functional tendon. Tissue Engineering. 10, 755-761. This method does not rely as heavily upon the material properties of pre-existing artificial or biological scaffolds which limit the physiologic or mechanical properties of the newly formed tissue. Rather media like collagen gels, fibrin gels, Matrigel, or synthetic gels are employed to orchestrate the formation of the newly formed tissue. Chen et al in Chen X, Zou ΧΗ, Yin GL, Ouyang HW. 2009. Tendon tissue engineering with mesenchymal stem cells and biografts: an option for large tendon defects? Frontiers in Bioscience. SI. 23-32 present a comprehensive review of this and other stem cell tissue engineering methods for tendon repair. However, the problems (a) and (b) highlighted above are still valid in the case of functional tissue engineering. [0014] Several efforts have been made to render reconstituted collagen structures with some degree of orientational anisotropy. The alignment of molecules and fibrils by mechanical loading, microfluidic channels, flow and magnetic field induced alignment, electrochemical processing, interstitial flow, high magnetic field, oriented electrospinning, Langmuir-Blodgett deposition, and extrusion processes have been demonstrated in the research lab. The collagen matrices produced by each of these processes have successfully caused the alignment of different cells. However, they do not mimic natural extracellular matrices (ECMs) and lack the essential natural spatial complexity, for example, controlled fibril diameters, aligned fibrils, crimps, periodicity and angular distribution. The lack of secondary structure results in poor strength in the synthetic scaffold and affects cellular survival and behavior. Builles et al. (2007) demonstrate the importance of the cell environment on a newly synthesized ECM. Some have achieved better control of fibril size and demonstrate the formation of tissue-like patterns. However, there are problems with the size of the construct they produce and the lengthy process required. The importance of nanoand micro- structures and their orientation is especially important for tendons and ligaments, since these tissues require strength, elasticity and a guide for cells to attach and migrate for repair to occur. For example, a recent review devoted to cellular-extracellular architecture of human tissue has no discussion about fibril orientation or alignment in ECM, although it states that “the importance of scaffold architecture in tissue engineering is increasingly being realized, which has resulted in a change in trend in the designs of scaffolds, from isotropic scaffolds to heterogeneous and anisotropic “biomimetic” scaffolds, with the goal being to mimic the organization of the cells (such as alignment or clustering) and/or the ECM of the tissue under consideration.” See 30. Singh Μ., Tech Β, Berkland C, and Detamore MS. 2008. Strategies and Applications for Incorporating Physical and Chemical Signal Gradients in Tissue Engineering. Tissue Engineering. Part Β. 14. 4: 341-366. [0015] More recently, methods to deposit collagen in ordered arrays on glass or plastic substrate to make a thin film with skin-like, tendon-like, aligned-braided, and other fibrillar structures have been described in United States Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0069893 and Unites States Patent Application Serial No. 11/951,324, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Importantly, these aligned and ordered collagen deposits direct the orientation of cells applied to them. Specifically, cells attach and align on the films and migrate along the axis of alignment. Such films can be treated with factors, such as growth factors which enhance cell survival, migration and proliferation. Other biopolymers can and have been devised to deliver cells to tissues but many lack biocompatibilities, are not lost or incorporated into the tissue or have physical properties quite different from the tissue and alter its function. [0016] Despite substantial efforts to develop biomaterials to mimic tendon, skin and other collagen-based fibrillar tissues, to date there is no industrial manufacturing method for producing these materials. Accordingly, significant further developments are much needed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0042] It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the compositions, films and methods described herein. In this application, the use of the singular includes the plural unless specifically state otherwise. Also, the use of “or” means “and/or” unless state otherwise. Similarly, “comprise,” “comprises,” “comprising,” “include,” “includes” and “including” are not intended to be limiting. The terms “layer” or “film” or “thin film” or “matrix” may be used interchangeably throughout the description. [0043] In general, the present invention is related to biocomposite materials and structures, and methods of making and using the same. In some embodiments, the present invention is directed to oriented collagen based biocomposite materials and structures, and methods of making. In some embodiments, methods of forming collagen based films where collagen is arrayed in various forms (aligned, kinked, woven or combinations of the above) are provided. The collagen based films can be converted or formed into individual pseudo-fibers by a sequential application of aqueous solvent and force at a solvent air interface. In some embodiments such pseudo-fibers can be cross linked to enhance their strength as well as treated with various factors or materials such as heparin to enhance their ability to store growth factors and/or to enhance their hydration, among other properties. [0044] The following non-limiting definitions are used herein. “Fibrillar biopolymers” refers to different types of collagen, laminin, fibronectin, fibrin, silk, other polypeptides and their combinations. [0045] “Oriented fibrillar biopolymer material” refers to material which has a repeating pattern. In particular, it can be a crystalline fibrillar biopolymer or semi-crystalline fibrillar biopolymer. In some embodiments the biopolymer is refereed to as “oriented” if its surface has a repeating pattern. In particular, the surface pattern can be determined by one of the 17 plane crystallographic groups. The orientation can be assessed by any one of optical polarimetry, polarized microscopy, laser diffraction, x-ray diffraction, atomic probe microscopy, electron microscope. [0046] “Fibrillar biopolymer solution and gel” have different phases depending on the concentration, temperature, pH, ionic strength, and additives. In some embodiments these phases are the liquid crystal phases with long range orientational order (e.g., isotropic, cholisteric, smectic, nematic, hexogonal). Different liquid crystal phases will appear to have distinct textures when viewed under a polarized microscope. Different phase can be recognized by light diffraction and scattering, by Muller matrix polarimetiy, by density variation, and by differential calorimetry. Collagen, laminin, DNA, many polypeptides, and other fibrillar biopolymer are the good examples of lyotropic liquid crystal materials. Small amount of inorganic additives (e.g., orthovanadate) may change the phase transition. A comprehensive information on the collagen phase formation is presented in Mosser G, Anglo A, Helary C, Bouligand Υ, Giraud-Guille MM. 2006; Dense tissue-like collagen matrices formed in cell-free conditions; Matrix Biology. 25: 3-13; which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. [0047] Application of the stable (laminar) flow conditions to a particular liquid phase results in pattern formation. In other words, in some embodiments the biopolymer solution or gel is flowed in a laminar manner or in the laminar regime. Examples of such flow conditions include, but are not limited to: Couette flow, Taylor-Couette flow, plane and axisymmetric Poiseuille flow. [0048] The change of ambient conditions (humidity, temperature, UV, X-ray, e-beam, electric, magnetic field) or key parameters of fibrillar biopolymer like pH and ionic strength may result in self-assembly process and cause transition from liquid/gel phase to a solid phase of oriented material. In an exemplary embodiment the transition from the liquid/gel phase to the solid phase is accomplished by a drying process. The resulting pattern of the biopolymer in the solid phase is dependent upon the pattern in the liquid phase and the self-assembly process. In one embodiment a fast drying process of the collagen solution results in the formation of helical fibrils with small diameter (transparent material), and a slow drying process results in the formation of helical fibrils with large diameter (hazy material). In the case of a thin collagen layer (e.g., several microns thickness) the resulting orientation substantially depends on the chemical and physical properties of the substrate. In some embodiments functionalization of the substrate may be used to control the orientation. [0049] A “pseudo-fiber” is produced when a free standing ribbon of oriented collagen is caused to roll up lengthwise about the long axis of the ribbon and be held stablely in place by electrostatic forces. [0050] A “thread” is produced by a weaving together a plurality of pseudo-fibers, typically three or more pseudo-fibers. [0051] A “biodegradable matrix” herein refers to a material which can naturally break down and be reabsorbed in a physiological environment. A biocompatible matrix here is a biocompatible material used to bond biopolymers together. [0052] It is useful to briefly review the structure of ligaments and tendons which has been discussed in the literature. While the characteristics of collagen at the molecular level have been extensively studied and are well understood, there is a less clear understanding of the characteristics and structure at the tendon and ligament level. [0053] Some embodiments of the present invention describe a manufactured scaffold product which has the same structure of tendons and ligaments found in mammalian bodies. The method begins with molecular grade collagen, typically type I, and reconstitutes it using a proprietary process into the scaffold. The process creates the scaffold in the absence of cellular or other biological material. Because these additional components are absent, it permits a clearer picture to be obtained of the resulting scaffold and its basic geometric structure. In so doing, it has given insights as to how these parts of the mammalian body are organized and how they are created, which have not been reported to date in the literature. [0054] In describing the structure of ligaments and tendons, there is an organizational hierarchy which has distinct properties at each level. Depending upon how each level is defined, researchers identify six, seven or eight levels. The following table 1 shows the terminology typically used to describe eight levels, (ref: “Tissue Mechanics” by Cowin & Doty, 2007). Table 1 Level 1 polypeptide Level 2 tropocollagen Level 3 microfibril Level 4 subfibril Level 5 fibril Level 6 fiber Level 7 fascicle Level 8 tendon and ligament [0055] Six of the levels, i.e. levels 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 are shown in FIG. 1. The following explanation is provided to assist the teaching of the present invention. In LEVEL 1, each polypeptide alpha chain which compose the collagen molecule consists of about 1000 amino acid residues. Each chain winds in a left-handed helix about 1.2 nm in diameter. [0056] In LEVEL 2, Tropocollagen or the "collagen molecule" is approximately 300 nm long and 1.5 nm in diameter. It is made up of three polypeptide alpha chains. These three left-handed helices are twisted together into a right-handed coil resulting in a triple helix. This triple helix is a "super helix" since it is right-handed helix comprised three left-handed helices. [0057] In LEVEL 3, The microfibril is formed by five strands of collagen molecules. Each strand is comprised of collagen molecules connected end-to-end with a discrete gap between them. These strands are wound together into a left-handed super-super helix by electrostatic forces to form the microfibril of diameter 3.5 to 4 nm. [0058] In LEVEL 4, The subfibril has a diameter of 10-20 nm and consists of a cluster of microfibrils. [0059] In LEVEL 5, The fibril is formed by winding together subfibrils to make a right-handed super-super-superhelix with a pitch of about 1090 nm and a diameter of 30-500 nm. The gaps between the ends of the collagen molecules of the microfibrils align to form the characteristic 67 nm “D-band” periodicity. [0060] In LEVEL 6, The fiber has a diameter of 1-20 um and consists of a cluster of fibrils. [0061] In LEVEL 7, Fascicles are composed of fibers which are assembled into structures which are organized in a crimp pattern which has been described as undulating waviness, waveform or zigzag. The function of the crimps is to provide the elasticity required for tissues subjected to tensile forces such as ligaments, tendons, heart pericardium, etc. These crimps do not occur in bone collagen that is largely subjected to compression forces. Cellular ingrowth occurs at the fascicle level. [0062] In LEVEL 8, The ligament and tendon are comprised of bundles of fascicles. There is no lateral coupling between fascicles so they can slide freely past each other which creates a smoothly functioning mechanical assembly. [0063] There have been numerous studies on the mechanical behavior of tendons and ligaments, such as the study by A.D.Freed and T.C.Doering in Freed AD and Doehring TC. 2005; Elastic Model for Crimped Collagen Fibril. J. Biomech. Eng. 127. 587-593. They observed that soft passive tissues are multiconstituent materials that, from a load carrying point of view, are predominantly composed of two elastic substances, collagen and elastin, immersed in a proteoglycan gel. They observe that fascicles are comprised of bundles of fibrils and do not discuss the intermediate form of “fiber”. They propose that the crimp formation is tied to the slender aspect ratio of the fibril, which buckles under the internal restoring forces of the elastin matrix whenever a fibrous tissue is free from external load. This rumpled configuration is known as crimp. This invention describes a different mechanism which produces the crimp. It is as a result of a collagen regeneration method as distinct from a buckling phenomena of existing collagen. [0064] As a simplifying assumption, they propose that the fibril which forms the crimp be considered as a mechanical coil spring. This assumption matches well with the observed nonlinear stress/strain behavior of crimped collagen tissues wherein the spring exhibits linear behavior at low stresses (toe region) of the stress/strain curve shown in FIG. 2C until the coil becomes stretched out. At that point the coil starts to become stiffer and stiffer causing a continuous increase in the slope of the curve (heel region). After the coil is fully stretched out, the behavior becomes linear again, but at a much steeper slope (linear region). This curve is known as the “J” curve owing to its shape. The mathematical model that they propose matches well with experimental data. [0065] FIG. 2Α is an SEM photograph showing the helical nature of crimped collagen fibers in chord* tendinae taken from a porcine mitral valve. FIG. 2Β is a diagram of the helical spring used by Freed and Doering in their mathematical model. It shows how the central force acting along the centerline of a helix is transferred to other areas of the helix. Note that the SEM photograph of FIG. 2Α shows a left-handed helix while the diagram FIG. 2Β shows a right-handed helix. Nowhere in the paper is the difference between the figures noted nor is the concept of handedness discussed, which illustrates a lack of understanding and teaching in the prior art. [0066] While there are many references in the literature to the helical nature of tendon and ligament crimps, no discussion of handedness could be found. Freed and Doering is a specific example of how the notion of handedness has gone unnoticed. [0067] In some embodiments of the present invention are described the production of bioequivalent reconstituted tendon like matrices made from solutions of purified monomeric collagen. These novel matrices include advantages such as but not limited to any one or more of: a) biocompatibility, b) high mechanical strength and “J” elasticity characteristics in the fibril direction, c) defect-free over a large area (2”xl0”), d) biomimetic (i.e. approximate the native ligament structure-at the nano- through macro-scales), and ℮) biodegradable depending on the level of crosslinking. FIGs. 3Α to 3F illustrate some examples of collagen films or membranes according to embodiments of the present invention. FIGs. 4Α and 4Β illustrate a comparison between rat-tail tendon and a collagen matrix formed according to embodiments of the present invention, respectively. The complex crimp and aligned-braided structure of the matrices can incorporate growth factors with a desired spatial gradient to augment biofunctionality. Fibroblasts, myoblasts, neurons, and mesenchymal stem cells show excellent proliferation, migration and alignment on these matrices. The tendon-like matrices can be formed into either fiber structures or multi-layer composite scaffolds. These scaffolds can be repopulated with patient stem cells and factors derived from the patient’s platelets to substantially reduce healing time and improve their efficiency. Embodiments of the present invention enable the production of native tissue scaffolds outside of the body. [0068] In one aspect of the present invention, methods of producing a biopolymer material, layer and/or structure are provided. In some embodiments a layer of multidomain semi-crystalline fibrillar biopolymer on a substrate are formed from a predominantly monomeric solution, comprising the steps of: producing a shear flow between a substrate and at least one solid means, inducing a long-range molecular and fibrillar orientation in the solution, controlling initial pH and temperature of the solution, controlling pH and temperature of the solution while in the shear flow, and drying the solution under controlled pH, temperature, and/or evaporation rates of the solution. [0069] The biopolymer layer may be formed of desired orientation. The particular orientation may be characterized by certain parameters and definitions depending upon the biopolymer organization, as discussed in detail below. [0070] In some embodiments the range of orientation is also controlled. Range of orientation is the crystallography term defined as the maximum distance between local domains of sameangle orientation. In this case, the range can be as small as 10 nm for skin-like orientation to as much as 0.5 meter for tendon-like orientation. [0071] Embodiments of the method of the present invention has benefits, such as long-range molecular orientation of liquid crystal solutions with low pH under the shear loading and self-assembly during drying at variable pH. In particular in some embodiments, the drying process can be kept at neutral pH adjusted to 7.4±0.2. The inventors have found that control of pH, temperature, and/or evaporation rate of the solution during the drying process assists in the self-assembly process of the collagen, in addition to applying shear flow. [0072] Different types fibrillar biopolymers can be used: fibrillar collagens, fibronectin, laminin, silk, etc. [0073] This method enables production of both uniform and multidomain semi-crystalline layers with short and long-range orientations. The distinctions are outlined in Table 2 and shown in FIGs. 5Α to 5C. Table 2 Biopolymer organization Range of Orientation Structure Tendon-like Long Uniform Woven skin-like Short Multi-domain Aligned-braided Long Uniform [0074] An example of the collagen layer prepared by the method described above is shown in FIG. 6Β. Each fibril extends in a vertical orientation and has a wavy shape which has a characteristic period. The periodicity of adjacent fibrils are approximately equal. The fibrils nest together to create a “crimp” pattern that is formed by the bunching of adjacent fibrils. The crimp pattern lies in the horizontal direction. [0075] FIG. 6Α is an SEM photo of the tendon structure of a porcine mitral heart valve which shows the characteristic crimp pattern seen in all tendons. The area within the box has the same dimensions as the formed material shown in FIG. 6Β. It can be seen that the crimp pattern of the artificial matrix in FIG. 6Β is similar to the crimp pattern of the actual tendon in FIG. 6Α. [0076] The morphology of the crimp pattern described above is formed by the nesting of helical fibrils of collagen. The helical structure is comprised of both right-handed and left-handed helices nested together to form a double super-helix structure as shown with reference to FIGs. 8Α to 8C. As shown in the figures, the “darker” shaded fibrils are right-handed, the “lighter” shaded fibrils are left-handed. [0077] Note that the crimps are actually the cluster of peaks of the nested helices. The peaks of the dark helices form right-handed crimps. The peaks of the light helices form left-handed crimps. [0078] These nested helices operate as an array of helical springs. The fact that the array is composed of approximately equal numbers of right and left-handed springs does not affect the spring constant of the array. However when the array is bent rather than extended, the right and left-handed springs tend to balance one another. One side of the array goes into tension, while the other goes into compression. The right and left-handed springs interlock and tend to balance one another creating a natural stability. [0079] FIGs. 8Α - 8C show a single double super-helix in several views. [0080] Depending upon the particular biopolymer organization, the definition of “orientation,” will have different meanings as illustrated in Table 3 below. Table 3: Definition of Orientation Biopolymer organization Component Definition Tendon-like Fibril Axis of helix Tendon-like “Crimp” Line connecting peaks of nested helical fibrils Aligned-braided Fibril Axis of helix Woven skin-like Fibril Local vector [0081] The key difference between tendon-like and the aligned-braided formation shown in FIG. 10 is the packing density of the helices. In the tendon-like, the helices are close-packed, whereas in aligned-braided, the helices are loose-packed. FIG. 11 is a AFM image of a double crimped biopolymer material according to some embodiments of the present invention. [0082] Based upon this more complete understanding of the structure of crimps, the ligament hierarchy can be modified as shown below in Table 4 below. Description Helical structure Structural components 1 polypeptide Left-handed 1 alpha chain 2 tropocollagen Right-handed 3 polypeptides 3 microfibril Left-handed 5 tropocollagens 4 subfibril 5 fibril Right-handed, left-handed Clusters of subfibrils 6 n/a (fiber) n/a n/a 7 fascicle Right-handed + left-handed Matched pairs of nested fibrils 8 tendon and ligament Tal lie 4 [0083] We have found that these films have oriented fibrillar structure and have some anisotropic mechanical strength and can be removed from the substrate either before or after treatment, modification, neutralization and or cross-linking, and the like. [0084] One example of such a modification involves an ion-exchange reaction. For example, it is the treatment by dipping the collagen film in an ortho-vanadate or pyrophosphate solution. Another example is to dip the collagen in a solution of heparin. Such modifications, change the properties of the film such as its ability to be hydrated, its ability to bind proteins or its ability to enhance the behavior of cells applied to it. Some examples of the ability of these collagen matrices to control cell behavior are shown in FIGs. 12Α - 12C. In general, aligned fibers cause cells to align along their axis. In the case of nerves, while the cells themselves do not show heightened alignment, the neurite processes they produce are highly extended and aligned with the fiber. Such phenomena of matrix structure controlling cell behavior extends to various stem cells. [0085] In some aspects a process for producing tendon-like collagen matrix from purified monomeric collagen solution is provided. Embodiments of this process are suitable for lyotropic liquid crystal materials, among others. According to some embodiments the molecular collagen solution in a liquid crystal state can be deposited on glass and plastic with optical precision by a precision applicator head as shown in and described more fully in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2008/0115724 (and in particular as shown in FIG. 1), the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In the exemplary embodiment the glass substrate is mounted on a stage which is transported by a linear actuator under a stationary applicator head. The head is adjustable to produce biopolymer matrices of different coating thicknesses. In one example a clean glass substrate and a coating speed of in the range from lOmm/sec to 1000 mm/sec is used to produce the desired crimp structures. In initial experiments, purified collagen I solutions from any of several commercial sources was used. The resulting matrices can be delaminated from the glass and have a variety of structures in situ as shown in FIGs. 3Α to 3F. A three-layer structure can be made comprised of two collagen matrices in cross orientation with a thin heparin layer bonding them together. This sample can be further crosslinked by exposure to riboflavin according to the procedure described in Wollensak G., Wilsch Μ., Spoerl Ε., Seiler Τ. 2004. Collagen fiber diameter in the rabbit cornea after collagen crosslinking by riboflavin/UVA. Cornea. 23. 5: 503-507. Two types of polymers were used, namely dextran and activated PolyEthylene Glycol for crosslinking. The thin tendon-like collagen matrix can be spontaneously converted into a pseudo-fiber as described in more detail below. Preliminary mechanical evaluation of the tendon-like collagen pseudo-fiber (125 pm in diameter) shows strength of at least 60 grams. This construct has considerable strength in both directions even without crosslinking. [0086] Referring to FIG. 9, another embodiment of the system 100 is shown. In this embodiment, the system 100 may comprise a prism 102 made of a hard material, such as stainless steel and the like. The prism 102 is precisely positioned over a smooth substrate 104, (such as glass, to form a gap 112. Components of the prism 102, in some embodiments, include an inlet profile 108, in some embodiments typically of cylindrical shape, a planar surface 106 polished to a high degree of flatness blended smoothly with the inlet profile and a sharp edge 110 which forms the transition at the exit of the gap 112. The method of positioning the prism over the substrate to form a precise gap is not discussed here. In some embodiments, a narrow strip of collagen solution liquid is deposited on the substrate to form a puddle 114. In certain embodiments, the liquid may be of sufficiently high viscosity to form a free-standing puddle. In some embodiments, the prism is held fixed and the substrate moves from left to right dragging the liquid into the inlet profile zone, causing the liquid to fill the gap until it reaches the exit. The gap can be in the range of 5-50 microns and the coating speed can range from 10 to 100 mm/sec. While in the narrow gap, the liquid is subjected to high shearing forces of sufficient time duration to cause it to become oriented. The sharp edge at the exit serves to minimize the size of the naturally occurring meniscus, which, if too large, would cause unacceptable streaking on the finished film. In alternate embodiments, the prism can be moved in relation to the substrate. [0087] In some embodiments, biocomposites of the present invention are formed using a liquid film applicator comprising: (i) at least two longitudinal side members having the form of parallel wedgelike rails with their bases occurring in the same plane as the substrate ; (ii) a crossover member having the form of a bridge between said side members, wherein said crossover member has at least one flat face and is in contact with each said rail in at least one point; and (iii) a clamp system ensuring strict fixation of the bridge at any preset position on said rails, wherein said bridge can be moved along both said rails so that the flat face of said bridge makes a certain constant dihedral angle within 10 arc minutes with the substrate plane and the gap between said flat face and said substrate plane has a width from 0 to 50 microns. [0088] Other methods of making are also taught according to methods of the present invention. For example, a tubular embodiment is provided wherein the shearing zone has a cylindrical geometry. The cylindrical geometry may be formed by any number of means, and in one embodiment the cylindrical geometry is comprised of a hollow cylinder having positioned within it a solid cylindrical mandrel. The shearing gap is formed by the differences in diameter between the hollow cylinder inner diameter and solid mandrel outer diameter. The biopolymeric material is extruded through the gap under the force of high pressure and in so doing creates a flow such as Couette flow, Taylor-Couette flow, plane or axisymmetric Poiseuille flow to form the oriented scaffold structure. Fine control of the gap can be achieved by fabricating both the hollow cylinder and solid mandrel at a slight taper angle. Axially displacing the mandrel with respect to the hollow cylinder will allow the gap to have a fine adjustment. In the above description, a tube will be formed with the average direction of the fibrils parallel to the central axis of the mandrel and cylinder components. By imparting a differential rotational velocity about the central axis of one component with respect to the other while the collagen tube is being extruded, the average direction of the fibrils will follow a helical path along the tube and create an angle with respect to the central axis. [0089] The discrete or continues biopolymeric film produced as described above can be transferred into the oriented biopolymeric (collagen) pseudo-fiber. This is one of the subjects of the present invention and may be formed by a system such as illustrated in FIG. 13. The thin collagen film (for example, 2-6 um thick and 1” wide) can be fully or partially dipped into a suitable solution as shown in FIG. 13 (for example, PBS solution). The film when removed from the solvent collapses into a pseudo-fiber at the air solution interface as shown in FIG. 7Α. The pseudo-fiber can be dried with or without mechanical and thermal treatment. Several pseudo-fibers can be braided to produce threads varying in diameter and strength. Examples of such thread and pseudo-fiber are shown in FIG. 7Β. Embodiments of the present invention allow control of the degree of elasticity of the final pseudo-fiber by producing collagen deposits on plastic or glass which have varied arrangement of collagen fibrils. For example, collagen deposited under alternate conditions can produce a kink or fold in the pseudo-fiber and final thread producing a thread with a J type of mechanical extension. Even greater elasticity can be produced by depositing collagen in a woven structure where bundles of aligned fibers support much greater elasticity. [0090] Of particular advantage films, fibers and pseudo-fibers produced according to the present invention may be used to support the attachment, migration and proliferation of cells. In general, cells can be applied to the pseudo-fibers by placing them in a suspension of cells in media. Alternatively, media containing the cells of interest can be applied to the dry suspended pseudo-fiber and allowed to flow down its length. Cells in the media bind to the collagen pseudo-fiber particularly in the presence of serum. The process can be repeated to increase the number of cells bound. One example of the use of oriented collagen pseudo-fiber for the delivery of stem cells into a tissue is shown in FIG. 14. [0091] Typically the cells to be delivered to a specific tissue will be either stem cells, nerve cells, muscle cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, embryonal stem cells or cells expected to improve repair, regeneration or function. Application to tissue can be as a patch or by insertion of a pseudo-fiber into the portion of the injured tissue using a catheter or needle as well known to physicians and those skilled in the art. [0092] Materials such as collagen, laminin, fibronectin or synthetics when deposited on a glass or plastic can serve as a system for testing the response of cells by plating cells thereon and then observing the behavior of the cells, such as whether there is attachment or not of the cells, migration or not, proliferation or not, and the like. Furthermore, growth factors or biological materials such as platelet rich plasma, which is a rich source of factors stimulating cell behavior, can be incorporated into the various substrates. One mechanism that can be used is adsorption. Another is incorporating factors such as heparin or other glycosaminoglycans which bind electrostaticly. Factors can also bind to certain regions of the substrate and have an affinity for a variety of growth factors. Similarly, bioactive materials such as vanadate, anti inflammatory agents of negative charge, or anti proteases including ethylenediamine tetra acetic acid or citrate bind tightly to the positively charged collagen substrates. The ability to modify cell behavior and the ability of cells to degrade the material are readily tested in cell culture. Additionally, such modified substrates are useful in a variety of assays for assessing cell behavior on the modified substrates including nerve cells, stem cells and tumor cells, among others. [0093] Of further advantage, embodiments of the present invention provide methods that enable formation functionalized and/or modified biocomposite structures. In some situations strong adherence to a substrate is required for cell culture studies. This can be accomplished by using functionalized surfaces which bind the deposited biopolymer either ionicly or by covalent bond formation. In other cases where the removal of deposited material is desired various deposition surfaces can be used which allow ready release of the deposit for further processing. [0094] In some embodiments, functional properties of such biopolymers can be modified or improved depending upon the desired application. Such modifications include the crosslinking of the deposited biopolymers and the sterilization of the material as deposited on the substrate or after further manipulations, among others. [0095] In some embodiments collagen starting solutions are prepared as follows. Molecular grade liquid collagen solution is obtained from a number of commercial sources such as BD with concentrations typically in the range of 3mg/ml. Mammalian sources of the collagen can be rat tail, bovine, porcine, human or others. The solution is placed inside a dialysis membrane tube with molecular weight cutoff range of 12,000 to 14,000 Daltons obtained from Spectrum Labs. The tube is placed in a vessel and covered on all sides with polyethylene glycol (PEG) of a molecular weight 20,000 chilled to 4°C. The PEG molecular weight must be larger than the molecular weight cutoff of the dialysis tube. The vessel and its contents are placed in an environment at 4°C for a time sufficient for the PEG to remove the water content from the collagen solution and raise its concentration. Times will vary dependant upon the volume of collagen in the tube and the saturation of the PEG on the outside and can be as little as 10 minutes and as much as 3 hours. The concentrated collagen is then removed from the tube and placed into a vial which is centrifuged at 4°C to remove any entrapped air. [0096] The collagen solution can also be prepared from a powdered form of collagen. Typical method is to add an acid such as HC1 or acetic acid at 4°C to the powder, let sit 18 hours at 4°C and dilute to the final concentration. [0097] Increased concentration can also be achieved by placing the collagen solution in a commercially designed vial with a dialysis-type membrane mounted at the bottom and centrifuging at 4°C until desired concentration is achieved. An example of such a vial is Vivaspin manufactured by Sartorius Stedim. Various molecular weight cutoffs of the membrane are available from 10,000 and upwards. Typical final concentrations of the collagen can range from 20 mg/ml up to 100 mg/ml. Preferred concentrations range from 40 mg/ml to 75 mg/ml. and can differ depending upon the desired fibrillar orientation and the particular nature of the starting collagen material from various suppliers. [0098] One important parameter which defines the phase of lyotropic liquid crystals is concentration. The methods to adjust the concentration are described above. Two other important parameters are ionic strength and pH. The used range of pH for liquid collagen I and laminin is from 2 to 9. The preferred range of pH is from 2 to 5. The used range of ionic strength is from 0.001Μ to 0.5Μ. The preferred range of ionic strength is from 0.1Μ to 0.3Μ. [0099] The standard process of the phase transition is evaporation process which can be accompanied with air-knife drying, vacuum, high and low temperature conditions. For a thin biopolymer layer a UV treatment can be effective if the biopolymer solution has been activated by UV sensitive additive like, for example, riboflavin. In this UV treatment may initiate the biopolymer crosslink. [0100] Self-assembly process in many fibrillar biopolymers highly depends on ionic strength and pH which can be regulated by, for example, ammonia evaporation. In the case of biopolymer deposition on a conductive/metallic substrate the ionic strength can be adjusted by the application of an electric field. [0101] Several polymeric materials like, for example, PET have low adhesion to collagen and laminin therefore this type of material can be used for a surface functionalization if the goal is to remove the oriented biopolymer from substrate. Standard adhesive tape can be used for this procedure. [0102] The aminosilylated glass functionalization causes a substantial change in the structure of oriented collagen thin film deposited on the glass surface. Thus, it results in a vertical fibril formation shown in FIG. 3Β instead of skin-like woven pattern shown in FIG. 3D fabricated without glass treatment. [0103] Additionally, certain growth factors, such as insulin, insulin like growth factors, VEGF, PDGF and the like, bind to receptors on the cell surface which stimulate cellular processes through tyrosine kinase receptor domains within the cells. Typically the kinase domain will phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptor which puts the receptor in an “active” state. Enzymatic removal of these phosphate residues by certain intracellular phosphatases terminates the “active’ state of the receptor and its activity on the cells behavior. Orthovanadate is able to inhibit these phosphatases and enhance receptor phosphorylation and activity. [0104] Factors such as growth factors and orthovanadate can be incorporated into the collagen structures to enhance stability and stimulate cellular responses. Orthovanadate which is incorporated without associated ligand into the actual structure of the collagen matrix secures its retention and minimizes matrix dissolution by serving as an ionic bridge linking adjacent molecules. In this form, the collagen/ orthovanadate complex enhances cell matrix interaction and increases cellular responses to endogenous and exogenously added tyrosine kinase growth stimulants especially cell survival, migration, proliferation and differentiation. There are reports of orthovanadate toxicity, however its incorporation in firm ionic association with collagen molecules in the absence of an associated ligand limits the diffusion of orthovanadate, restricts its systemic exposure and limits its actions to cells entering or in contact with the construct. [0105] We have described methods to prepare purified collagen from solution into films where collagen is arrayed in various forms (aligned, kinked, woven or combinations of the above), among other aspects. Such materials can be converted into individual pseudo-fibers by a sequential application of aqueous solvent and force at a solvent air interface. Such pseudo-fibers can be cross linked to enhance their strength as well as treated with various factors such as heparin and others to enhance their ability to store growth factors and to enhance their hydration. Application to the tissue requiring treatment is by standard procedures well known to physicians skilled in the art. [0106] It is understood that the examples and embodiments described herein are for illustrative purposes only and that various modifications or changes in light thereof will be suggested to persons skilled in the art and are to be included within the spirit and purview of this application and scope of the appended claims. All publications, patents, and patent applications cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes. EXAMPLES [0107] The following examples are provided for illustration purposes only, and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention in any way. [0108] Cell culture investigations were performed with fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells (mouse adipose-derived and human bone marrow derived). The following cell growth media were used: low-glucose DMEM with 10% FBS for fibroblasts, high-glucose DMEM with 10% FBS for adipose-derived stem cells, alpha-MEM with 20% FBS for human mesenchymal stem cells (all media were supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mM L-glutamine). [0109] Example 1: Cell seeding on oriented collagen film (matrix) with tendon-like structure on a glass chip. Fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells (mouse adipose-derived and human bone marrow derived) were used. Cells were seeded at 4-6,000 cells/cm2 onto collagen substrates on glass chips placed in 6-well cell culture plates, in growth medium with no FBS and allowed to attach. Then the medium was changed for complete growth medium (with 10% FBS), in which cells were maintained up to one week. The cells align on the substrate according to its pattern, see the Figure Α2. Cells are observed until they form a monolayer sheet (up to one week). [0110] Example 2: cell seeding on a collagen pseudo-fiber. Fibroblasts were used. Cells were seeded on a oriented collagen pseudo-fiber in a high density cell suspension (106 cells/ml): a 3-cm pseudo-fiber was placed in an 15-ml Falcon tube with 1 ml of cell suspension and incubated on a shaker for 30 min at 37°C in CO2 incubator. The cell-seeded pseudo-fiber was then placed into a well of a 6-well culture plate, with its ends fixed with glass chips. Cell attachment was verified after seeding with light microscopy, and cell migration from the pseudo-fiber was monitored with light and fluorescent microscopy, as shown in FIG. 14. [0111] Example 3: Collagen ribbon is dipped into an acidic solution of orthovanadate which has a sodium chloride buffer. As a result of ion-exchange reactions, the orthovanadate will crosslink the collagen fibrils and form collagen-vanadate composite matrix, which preserves the structural characteristics. Neutralization in PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) solution and rinsing in DI water removes superfluous orthovanadate.

They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.
