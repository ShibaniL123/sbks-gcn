RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is related to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/721,881, filed Nov. 2, 2012, U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/778,231, filed Mar. 12, 2013, and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/889,276, filed Oct. 10, 2013, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A biological target of recent interest is histone deacetylase (HDAC) (see, for example, a discussion of the use of inhibitors of histone deacetylases for the treatment of cancer: Marks et al. Nature Reviews Cancer 2001, 7, 194; Johnstone et al. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery 2002, 287). Post-translational modification of proteins through acetylation and deacetylation of lysine residues plays a critical role in regulating their cellular functions. HDACs are zinc hydrolases that modulate gene expression through deacetylation of the N-acetyl-lysine residues of histone proteins and other transcriptional regulators (Hassig et al. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997, 1, 300-308). HDACs participate in cellular pathways that control cell shape and differentiation, and an HDAC inhibitor has been shown effective in treating an otherwise recalcitrant cancer (Warrell et al. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998, 90, 1621-1625). At this time, eleven human HDACs, which use Zn as a cofactor, have been identified (Taunton et al. Science 1996, 272, 408-411; Yang et al. J. Biol. Chem. 1997, 272, 28001-28007. Grozinger et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999, 96, 4868-4873; Kao et al. Genes Dev. 2000, 14, 55-66; Hu et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275, 15254-15264; Zhou et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U.S.A. 2001, 98, 10572-10577; Venter et al. Science 2001, 291, 1304-1351) and these members fall into three classes (class I, II, and IV) based on sequence homology to their yeast orthologues (O. Witt et al. Cancer Letters, 2009, 277, 8-21). Class I HDACs include HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8, and are referred to as “classical” HDACs, which implies a catalytic pocket with a Zn2+ ion at its base. There remains a need for preparing structurally diverse HDAC inhibitors, particularly ones that are potent and/or selective inhibitors of particular classes of HDACs and individual HDACs.

Hemoglobin protein levels within each cell were determined at day 4 of differentiation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC2 has been shown to derepress fetal globin. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) derepression, or induction, is an established therapeutic strategy in sickle cell disease (SCD), and could also be effective in treating beta-thalassemia. Hydroxyurea is currently the only drug with proven efficacy in sickle cell disease. This therapy is cytotoxic, poorly tolerated, and only reduces the frequency and severity of sickle cell crises in a subset of patients. There are no approved drugs for treatment of beta-thalassemia. Fetal (γ) globin expression is silenced in adults partly through the action of a complex containing BCL11A and HDACs 1 and 2. Genetic ablation and chemical inhibition of HDAC1 or HDAC2 result in the derepression of γ globin in adult bone marrow derived erythroid cells (Bradner, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2010). While a variety of non-specific HDAC inhibitors have been used successfully to induce HbF, further clinical development has been limited by their variable efficacy and concerns over off target side-effects observed in small clinical trials. Therefore, development of selective and potent HDAC1 and HDAC2 inhibitors leading to HbF reactivation represents a refined and more targeted therapeutic approach for the treatment of SCD and beta-thalassemia. It has also been shown that deregulated HDAC1 expression is particularly common in advanced cancers of the gastrointestinal system, such as, for example, pancreatic, colorectal, and liver (hepatocellular) carcinomas as well as in prostate and breast cancer. HDAC2 and HDAC3 expression are also associated with advanced stage disease and poor prognosis in gastric, prostate and colorectal cancers. HDAC2 is also over expressed in cervical cancer. Clinical trials for the treatment of patients with advanced solid tumors, lymphomas, and leukemias utilizing class I selective HDAC inhibitors such as MS275, depsipeptide, and MGCD0103 have been published (O. Witt et al., Cancer Letters, 2009, 277, 8-21 and H-J. Kim and S.-C. Bae, Am. J. Transl. Res. 2011; 3(2): 166-179). HDACs have also been found to repress HIV-1 (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) transcription through deacetylation events, particularly in latently infected resting CD4+ T cells. As such, it is known that HDAC inhibitors can induce the transcriptional activation of the HIV-1 promoter, or re-activate latent HIV-1 from the patient viral reservoir. It is generally accepted that the use of HDAC inhibitors in the treatment of HIV infection can be valuable in purging the latently infected reservoirs in patients, particularly patients undergoing Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAAT). For examples of HDAC inhibitors used alone or in combination with one or more anti-retroviral agents for the treatment of HIV latency and/or infection, please see US 2010/0166806, US 2010/0324034, and US 2012/0203014, which are hereby incorporated in their entirety.

The compounds are, in particular, able to inhibit HDAC1 and HDAC2 activity. The compounds described herein may have HDAC1 IC50 values ranging from 5 to 100 nM and HDAC2 IC50 values ranging from 10 to 300 nM, demonstrating approximately 10- to 100-fold selectivity over HDAC3, respectively. Certain compounds also have good oral bioavailability in rat and monkey, with area under curve values (AUC) exceeding 10000 ng*hr/mL following a 4-5 mg/kg dose.

Example 1 Synthesis of N-(2-aminophenyl)-2-(piperazin-1-yl)quinoline-6-carboxamide Experimental Procedure Step 1: A mixture of compound 1 (10 g, 0.53 mol) and m-CPBA (18.4 g, 0.106 mol) in DCM (50 ml) was stirred at r.t. overnight. Aq. NaHCO3 (40 ml, saturated) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred for 30 min. The organic layer was separated, dried, filtered and concentrated to obtain a residue, which was re-crystallized by EA (5 ml) to afford compound 2 (8.7 g, 80%) as a light yellow solid. Step 2: To a solution of compound 2 (4.0 g, 0.020) and DMF (8 ml) in DCM was added SOCl2 (8 ml) slowly at 0° C. and stirred at r.t. for 5 h. The resulting mixture was concentrated to obtain a residue, and DCM (50 ml) with Aq. NaHCO3 (saturated, 20 ml) was added and stirred for 30 min. The organic layer was separated and concentrated to obtain a residue, which was purified by silica gel chromatography to afford compound 3 (1.3 g, 30%) as a white solid. Step 3: A mixture of compound 3 (10 g, 0.045 mol), CuI (10 g, 0.53 mol), N-boc-piperazine (25 g, 0.135 mol) and K2CO3 (18.6 g, 0.135 mol) in DMSO (120 ml) was stirred at 100° C. for overnight. Upon completion as monitored by TLC (thin-layer chromatography), 300 ml of EA (ethyl acetate) was added, followed by filtration (underlay 15 cm diatomite). Concentration of the mixture yielded a residue, to which water (300 ml) and Aq. Citric acid (saturated, 30 ml) were added. Stirring at r.t. for 30 min., followed by filtration yielded compound 4 (18 g, ˜100%) as a yellow solid to be used in the next step without purification. Step 4: A mixture of compound 4 (18 g, crude) and 2M NaOH (50 ml) in EtOH (100 ml) and THF (100 ml) was stirred at 70° C. for 4 h. TLC was used to monitor the reaction to completion.

LCMS: m/z=481 (M+H)+ Example 46 HDAC Enzyme Assays Compounds for testing were diluted in DMSO to 50 fold the final concentration and a ten point three fold dilution series was made. The compounds were diluted in assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 0.001% Tween-20, 0.05% BSA, 20 μM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) to 6 fold their final concentration. The HDAC enzymes (purchased from BPS Biosciences) were diluted to 1.5 fold their final concentration in assay buffer and pre-incubated with the compounds for 24 hours prior to addition of the substrate. The substrate tripeptide substrate 3 (synthesized in house) for each enzyme was equal to the Km as determined by a substrate titration curve. The enzyme and substrate concentrations used are given in Table 2. The substrates were diluted in assay buffer at 6× their final concentration with 0.3 μM sequencing grade trypsin (Sigma). The substrate/trypsin mix was added to the enzyme/compound mix, the plate was shaken for 60 seconds and placed into a Spectramax M5 microtiter plate reader. The development of fluorescence was monitored for 30 mM and the linear rate of the reaction was calculated. The IC50 was determined using Graph Pad Prism by a four parameter curve fit. The IC50 values obtained for the compounds of this invention are found in Table 1. TABLE 2 Enzyme concentration Substrate concentration HDAC1 3.5 ng/μl 3.8 μM HDAC2 0.2 ng/μl 2.3 μM HDAC3 0.08 ng/μl 3.9 μM Example 47 CD34+ Globin Switching Assay CD34+ cells isolated from human bone marrow were cultured in vitro using two distinct sets of culture conditions. Culture system 1 (CS1), described by Xu J et al. (Science 2011 Nov. 18; 334(6058):993-6), consists of a 7 day expansion phase in media that supports hematopoietic progenitor cells followed by a differentiation phase of 4 to 8 days in media that induces development of erythroid lineage cells. Culture system 2 (CS2), described by Bradner J E (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2010 Jul. 13; 107(28):12617-22), consists of a 7 day expansion phase in media that supports differentiation of cells towards the erythroid lineage followed by a differentiation phase for 3 days where erythroid cell development continues. After 3 to 5 days in differentiation media CS1 cells are primarily early erythroblasts (EB), while CS2 cells are primarily late EB. mRNA levels were determine by quantitative real time PCR using primer/probe sets designed to adult major β-globin (β), adult minor β-globin (δ), fetal β-like globin (HbG, γ), and embryonic β-like globin (ε). Protein levels were determined by flow cytometry using fluorescent antibodies against fetal hemoglobin (HbF) or adult hemoglobin (HbA). In the experiment shown in FIG. 1A, cells from CS1 were differentiated in the presence of vehicle (DMSO), 30 μM hydroxyurea, 1 μM MS-275 (entinostat), or 1 μM Compound 001. Globin mRNA levels were determined in cells at day 0, 3, 5, and 8 of differentiation. In the experiment shown in FIG. 1B, cells from CS2 were differentiated in the presence of vehicle (DMSO) or 5, 1, or 0.3 μM of Compound 001, Compound 002, or Compound 003. Globin mRNA levels were determined at day 3 of differentiation. In the experiment shown in FIG. 1C, upper row, cells from CS1 were differentiated in the presence of vehicle (DMSO), or 1 μM each of MS-275 (entinostat), Compound 001, Compound 002, or Compound 003. Hemoglobin protein levels within each cell were determined at day 5 of differentiation. In the experiment shown in FIG. 1C, lower row; cells from CS2 were differentiated for 2 days in the presence of vehicle (DMSO), or 1 μM each of MS-275 (entinostat), Compound 001, Compound 002, or Compound 003. After 2 days, media was exchanged and cells were differentiated for an additional 2 days in the absence of compound. Hemoglobin protein levels within each cell were determined at day 4 of differentiation. The results of these experiments are shown in FIGS. 1A, 1B, and 1C. Example 48 Pharmacological Inhibition of Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) 1, 2 or 3 have Distinct Effects on Cellular Viability, Erythroid Differentiation, and Fetal Globin (HbG) Induction The goal of this example was to investigate the effects of selective inhibitors of HDAC1, 2, or 3 on cytotoxicity, erythroid differentiation, and HbG induction in cultured human CD34+ bone marrow cells. To investigate whether HDAC1 or HDAC2 was the preferred therapeutic target, two compounds were used. Compound 001 is an HDAC1/2 selective compound biased towards HDAC1 with IC50 values of 4, 15, and 114 nM for HDAC1, 2, and 3, respectively. In contrast, Compound 004 showed balanced HDAC1 and HDAC2 selectivity with IC50 values of 27, 24, and 247 nM for HDAC1, 2, and 3, respectively. Treatment of cells for 6 days with 1 μM of Compound 001 or Compound 004 resulted in a 3-fold increase in the percentage of HbG relative to other beta-like globin transcripts. However, it was found that Compound 001 treatment resulted in an approximately 3-fold decrease in cell viability after 6 days of treatment, while Compound 004 treatment resulted in a minimal reduction (1.2-fold) in cell viability. Decreased cell viability observed with Compound 001 was associated with a reduction of cells positive for the erythroid differentiation markers CD71 and glycophorinA. This result is consistent with the Mx-Cre mouse model where HDAC1KO; HDAC2het had reduced numbers of erythrocytes, thrombocytes, and total bone marrow cells, while the HDAC1het; HDAC2KO was unaffected (Wilting R H, EMBO Journal, 2010). These results suggest that compounds with a pharmacological profile of increased selectivity towards HDAC2 inhibition versus HDAC1 may be less cytotoxic and minimize effects on differentiation, while still inducing HbG in human CD34+ bone marrow cells. Example 49 Mechanistic Insights into Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) Induction Through Chemical Inhibition of Histone Deacetylase 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2) The mechanism through which HDAC1/2 inhibition leads to activation of HbG remains largely unknown. In this example, Compound 001 was used to investigate changes in gene expression and chromatin organization that result from inhibition of HDAC1/2. Gene expression profiling was performed on cells treated with Compound 001 (n=3) or vehicle (n=3) using Affymetrix PrimeView GeneChips. Treatment of early erythroblasts (CD71+, GlyA−) resulted in the up and down regulation of 1294 and 681 probe sets, respectively. In comparison, treatment of late erythroblasts (CD71+, GlyA+) resulted in a total of 255 probe set changes. This finding is consistent with follow-up experiments demonstrating that Compound 001 is unable to induce HbG in cells positive for both CD71 and GlyA. Taken together, these results suggest that erythroblasts become less responsive to HDAC inhibition as they mature. Gene set enrichment analysis using public domain data revealed that genes up- or down-regulated by HDAC1/2 shRNA knockdown are significantly over represented in the list of genes induced or repressed by Compound 001, respectively, suggesting pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC1/2 recapitulates genetic ablation. Significant enrichment in other gene sets involving targets linked to HbG regulation, including lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) (Shi L, Nature Medicine, 2012) were identified. GeneChip and quantitative real-time PCR time course experiments show that Compound 001 treatment leads to a decrease in Bcl11A (2-fold) and Sox6 (10-fold) mRNA, known repressors of fetal globin synthesis, and an increase in Klf2 (2-fold) and Gata2 (8-fold) mRNA, proposed fetal globin activators. This result is consistent with work by others that show Gata2 is suppressed, in part, by the NuRD complex (Hong W, EMBO Journal, 2005) and that Gata2 binding at the HbG promoter leads to increased levels of HbG expression (Zhu X, PLoS One, 2012). Interestingly, Gata2 induction preceded Sox6 suppression in Compound 001 treated cells and the Sox6 promoter contains 8 canonical WGATAR binding sites and one Gata2-specific binding motif, raising the possibility suppression of Sox6 by Compound 001 is mediated by Gata2 induction. To investigate these possibilities, chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next generation sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed for HDAC1, HDAC2, Gata2, and the HDAC2-specific histone modification H3K56 in Compound 001 and vehicle treated cells. ChIP-seq data, both by itself and in combination with gene expression data, will provide further insight into the mechanism through which HDAC1/2 regulates HbF synthesis.
