Step 1. Ethyl 2-fluoro-3-(3-(4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridin-5-yl)benzoate
To a solution of 5-chloro-3-(4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl)-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine (Example 1, Step 2, 200 mg, 0.61 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (4 mL) and water (1 mL) was added ethyl 2-fluoro-3-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzoate (380 mg, 1.29 mmol) and potassium phosphate (280 mg, 1.32 mmol), followed by (2'-aminobiphenyl-2-yl)(chloro)(dicyclohexyl(2',4',6'-triisopropylbiphenyl-2-yl)phosphoranylidene)palladium (50 mg, 0.064 mmol), and the reaction vial was purged with nitrogen for 5 mins. After this time the reaction mixture was stirred at 90Â° C. for 15 hours. It was then cooled to r.t., filtered and concentrated to dryness. The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography using 0-10% methanol in DCM to afford desired product as yellowish solid (151 mg, 55%).
