FIELD OF INVENTION This invention relates to compositions comprising polymer blends which are useful as viscosity modifiers. These compositions may comprise an oil of lubricating viscosity, a hydrogenated copolymer of an olefin block and vinyl aromatic block, wherein the copolymer is optionally functionalized, and a radial polymer. These compositions may be useful as lubricating compositions, for example, engine oils. BACKGROUND The use of polymers as viscosity modifiers (or viscosity index improvers) or dispersant viscosity modifiers in oils of lubricating viscosity is known. Typical polymer backbones include polymethacrylates, polyolefins or hydrogenated styrene-butadienes, and functional derivatives thereof. For dispersant viscosity modifiers, the backbone may be functionalized with a grafted nitrogen-containing compound. SUMMARY Viscosity modifiers (VMs) used in engine oils often have a strong influence on the fuel economy obtained by the engine. In general, higher molecular weight VMs tend to provide better fuel economy because the viscosity of the oil under shear tends to be less as compared to VMs with lower molecular weights. However, higher molecular weight VMs also tend to exhibit more permanent loss in viscosity as a result of polymer chain scission. The permanent loss of these VMs may be measured using the Shear Stability Index (SSI) test which measures the percentage of viscosity loss of a polymer after shearing. High SSI (e.g., 40-50 SSI) polymers tend to lose significant amounts of viscosity upon shearing. Conventional VMs such as olefin copolymers typically require a high SSI in order to consistently pass the ILSAC Sequence VIB fuel economy test. The ILSAC Sequence VIB test is a fuel economy test required for North American gasoline engine lubricants with GF-4 credentials. The test measures both initial fuel economy and fuel economy durability. US 2009/0143261 discloses engine oil compositions comprising polymer viscosity index improver such as e.g. styrene-olefin copolymers. These engine oils pass the ILSAC Sequence VIB fuel economy test. Recently, some manufacturers have indicated that there is a need for lubricants to stay in grade after substantial use in the field. This has resulted in some manufacturers requiring that the permanent shear be no greater than 35 SSI. This is in conflict with the requirement for providing good fuel economy. The problem therefore is to provide an engine oil composition containing a VM that exhibits good shear stability (i.e., 35 SSI or less) and passes the ILSAC Sequence VIB fuel economy test. This invention provides a solution to this problem. The present invention relates to lubricating oil composition, comprising: (I) an oil of lubricating viscosity; (II) a hydrogenated copolymer comprising at least one of block A and at least one of block B, block A comprising an olefin polymer block, block B comprising a vinyl aromatic polymer block, the mole ratio of monomer units in block A to monomer units in the combination of block A plus block B being in the range from 0.5 to 0.9; wherein from 5 to 95 mol % of the repeat units in block A contain alkyl branching groups, with the proviso that when the copolymer comprises a tapered copolymer greater than 38.5 mol % to 95 mol % of the repeat units in block A contain alkyl branching groups; and (III) a radial polymer comprising a core and 3 to 12 polymeric arms extending from the core, each arm being derived from one or more conjugated dienes and one or more monoalkenyl aromatic hydrocarbons, each arm having a weight average molecular weight in the range from 40,000 to 200,000, each arm being hydrogenated at from 90 to 100% of the available double bonds, the radial polymer having a weight average molecular weight in the range from 300,000 to 2,500,000, wherein the weight ratio of (II) to (III) is in the range from 90:10 to 10:90, wherein the concentration of (II) and (III) in the composition is in the range from 0.5% to 2.5%.

It is to be understood that unless specifically stated otherwise, references to "a," "an," and/or "the" may include one or more than one, and that reference to an item in the singular may also include the item in the plural. The term "hydrocarbyl substituent" or "hydrocarbyl group" is used in its ordinary sense, which is well-known to those skilled in the art. Specifically, it refers to a group having a carbon atom directly attached to the remainder of the molecule and having predominantly hydrocarbon character. Examples of hydrocarbyl groups include: (i) hydrocarbon substituents, that is, aliphatic (e.g., alkyl or alkenyl), alicyclic (e.g., cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl) substituents, and aromatic-, aliphatic-, and alicyclic-substituted aromatic substituents, as well as cyclic substituents wherein the ring is completed through another portion of the molecule (e.g., two substituents together form a ring);(ii) substituted hydrocarbon substituents, that is, substituents containing non-hydrocarbon groups which, in the context of this invention, do not alter the predominantly hydrocarbon nature of the substituent (e.g., halo (especially chloro and fluoro), hydroxy, alkoxy, mercapto, alkylmercapto, nitro, nitroso, and sulphoxy);(iii) hetero substituents, that is, substituents which, while having a predominantly hydrocarbon character, in the context of this invention, contain other than carbon in a ring or chain otherwise composed of carbon atoms. Heteroatoms include sulphur, oxygen, nitrogen, and encompass substituents as pyridyl, furyl, thienyl and imidazolyl. In general, no more than two, preferably no more than one, non-hydrocarbon substituent will be present for every ten carbon atoms in the hydrocarbyl group; typically, there will be no non-hydrocarbon substituents in the hydrocarbyl group. The term "branched alkyl groups" includes branched alkyl groups that are optionally further substituted. As otherwise stated, alkyl branches on the polymer chain may or may not themselves be further branched.

It is to be understood that the upper and lower amount, range, and ratio limits set forth herein may be independently combined. Similarly, the ranges and amounts for each element of the invention may be used together with ranges or amounts for any of the other elements. (I) Oil of Lubricating Viscosity The inventive composition comprises an oil of lubricating viscosity. The oils that may be used may include natural and synthetic oils, oil derived from hydrocracking, hydrogenation, and hydrofinishing, unrefined, refined and re-refined oils and mixtures of two or more thereof. Unrefined oils are those obtained directly from a natural or synthetic source generally without (or with little) further purification treatment. Refined oils are similar to the unrefined oils except they have been further treated in one or more purification steps to improve one or more properties. Purification techniques are known in the art and include solvent extraction, secondary distillation, acid or base extraction, filtration, percolation and the like. Re-refined oils are also known as reclaimed or reprocessed oils, and are obtained by processes similar to those used to obtain refined oils and often are additionally processed by techniques directed to removal of spent additives and oil breakdown products. The natural oils may include animal oils, vegetable oils (e.g., castor oil, lard oil), mineral lubricating oils such as liquid petroleum oils and solvent-treated or acid-treated mineral lubricating oils of the paraffinic, naphthenic or mixed paraffinic-naphthenic types and oils derived from coal or shale or mixtures thereof. The synthetic oils may include hydrocarbon oils such as polymerized and interpolymerized olefins (e.g., polybutylenes, polypropylenes, propyleneisobutylene copolymers); poly(1-hexenes), poly(1-octenes), poly(1-decenes), and mixtures thereof; alkyl-benzenes (e.g. dodecylbenzenes, tetradecylbenzenes, dinonylbenzenes, di-(2-ethylhexyl)-benzenes); polyphenyls (e.g., biphenyls, terphenyls, alkylated polyphenyls); alkylated diphenyl ethers and alkylated diphenyl sulphides and the derivatives, analogs and homologs thereof or mixtures thereof. Other synthetic lubricating oils that may be used may include liquid esters of phosphorus-containing acids (e.g., tricresyl phosphate, trioctyl phosphate, and the diethyl ester of decane phosphonic acid), and polymeric tetrahydrofurans. Synthetic oils may be produced by Fischer-Tropsch reactions and typically may be hydroisomerised Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbons or waxes. In one embodiment oils may be prepared by a Fischer-Tropsch gas-to-liquid synthetic procedure as well as other gas-to-liquid oils. The oils of lubricating viscosity may comprise one or more oils as specified in the American Petroleum Institute (API) Base Oil Interchangeability Guidelines. The five base oil groups are as follows: Group I (sulphur content >0.03 wt %, and/or <90 wt % saturates, viscosity index 80-120); Group II (sulphur content <0.03 wt %, and ≥90 wt % saturates, viscosity index 80-120); Group III (sulphur content ≤0.03 wt %, and ≥90 wt % saturates, viscosity index ≥120); Group IV (all polyalphaolefins (PAOs)); and Group V (all others not included in Groups I, II, III, or IV). The oil of lubricating viscosity comprises an API Group I, Group II, Group III, Group IV, Group V oil or mixtures thereof. Often the oil of lubricating viscosity is an API Group I, Group II, Group III, Group IV oil or mixtures thereof. Alternatively the oil of lubricating viscosity is often an API Group I, Group II, Group III oil or mixtures thereof. The lubricant composition may be in the form of a concentrate and/or a fully formulated lubricant. If the polymer blend of the present invention is in the form of a concentrate (which may be combined with additional oil to form, in whole or in part, a finished lubricant), the ratio of the polymer blend to the oil of lubricating viscosity and/or to diluent oil may include the ranges of 1:99 to 99:1 by weight, or 80:20 to 10:90 by weight. (II) Hydrogenated Copolymer The hydrogenated copolymer may comprise block A and block B. These may be represented by the formulae: and wherein a and b are coefficients for their corresponding monomer repeat units, wherein the ratio of a/(a+b) is 0.5 to 0.9, or 0.55 to 0.8, or 0.6 to 0.75;R2 is H, alkyl, or alkyl-Z, with the proviso that 5 mol % to 95 mol % of the R2 groups are alkyl or alkyl-Z groups (in one embodiment, R2 is not H);R3 is an arene group or an alkyl-substituted arene group optionally further functionalized with a pendant carbonyl-containing group;E is an alkylene group or an alkenylene group (typically E is a C4 group);X, Y and Z are independently H or pendant carbonyl-containing groups, with the proviso that at least one of X, Y and Z is a pendant carbonyl-containing group; andm, n, and o are numbers of repeat units for the moieties described above, with the proviso that each repeat unit is present in sufficient quantities to provide the polymer with an appropriate number average molecular weight, and wherein the polymer is terminated with a polymerisation terminating group, and with the proviso that when the copolymer comprises a tapered copolymer block, A contains repeat units with greater than 38.5 mol % to 95 mol % of branched, optionally substituted alkyl groups (that is, alkyl branching groups). The hydrogenated copolymer may be represented by the formula: wherein a and b are coefficients for their corresponding monomer repeat units, wherein the ratio of a/(a+b) is 0.5 to 0.9, or 0.55 to 0.8, or 0.6 to 0.75;R1 is H, t-alkyl, sec-alkyl, CH3-, R'2N-, or aryl, or, in another embodiment, primary alkyl;R2 is H, alkyl or alkyl-Z, with the proviso that in block (A) 5 mol % to 95 mol % of the R2 groups are alkyl or -alkyl-Z groups;R3 is an arene group or an alkyl-substituted arene group optionally further functionalized with a pendant carbonyl-containing group;R4 is a polymerising terminating group, such as H or alkyl;E is an alkylene group or an alkenylene group (typically E is a C4 group);X, Y and Z are independently H or a carbonyl-containing group, with the proviso that at least one of X, Y and Z is a pendant carbonyl-containing group;R' is a hydrocarbyl group, andm, n, and o are numbers of repeat units for the moieties described above, with the proviso that each repeat unit is present in sufficient quantities to provide the hydrogenated copolymer with an appropriate number average molecular weight, and with the proviso that when the copolymer comprises a tapered copolymer, block A contains repeat units with greater than 38.5 mol % to 95 mol % of branched, optionally substituted alkyl groups (that is, branching alkyl groups). The hydrogenated copolymer may be made by the process comprising: (a) polymerizing (i) a vinyl aromatic polymer block and (ii) an olefin polymer block, wherein the olefin reacts by 1,2-addition to give 5 mol % to 95 mol % of branched, optionally substituted alkyl groups in the olefin polymer block, followed by one or more of steps (b) to (d);(b) optionally hydrogenating the product of step (a);(c) optionally either (c1) reacting, under free radical grafting conditions (in processes well known to a person skilled in the art of polymer science e.g., solution phase and/or melt processes i.e. extrusion grafting), a carbonyl containing compound, with the polymer from step (b) to form a polymer with a pendant carbonyl containing group, or(c2) reacting, under thermal grafting conditions, a carbonyl containing compound with the polymer from step (a) to form a polymer with a pendant carbonyl containing group, followed by optionally hydrogenating the polymer of (c2);(d) optionally reacting the carbonyl containing polymer of step (c1) and/or (c2) with at least one of an alcohol and/or an amine (typically forming an ester, an amide or an imide) to form a functionalized polymer, with the proviso that when the copolymer comprises a tapered copolymer, block A contains repeat units with greater than 38.5 mol % to 95 mol % of branched, optionally substituted alkyl groups (that is, alkyl branching groups); and(e) optionally reacting the copolymer with a pendant carbonyl-containing group with at least one of an alcohol and/or an amine, to form a functionalized polymer, with the proviso that when the copolymer comprises a tapered copolymer, block A contains repeat units with greater than 38.5 mol % to 95 mol % of branched, optionally substituted alkyl groups (that is, alkyl branching groups). The hydrogenated copolymer may be hydrogenated at 50 % to 100 %, or 90 % to 100 % or 95 % to 100 % of available double bonds (which does not include aromatic unsaturation). In one embodiment block A may be derived from one or more dienes. Suitable dienes used to generate the block represented by A include 1,4-butadiene or isoprene. In one embodiment the diene is 1,4-butadiene. In one embodiment block A is substantially free of, or free of, isoprene. As used herein the term "substantially free of isoprene" means the polymer contains isoprene-derived units at not more than impurity levels, typically, less than 1 mol % of the polymer, or 0.05 mol % or less of the polymer, or 0.01 mol % or less of the polymer, or 0 mol % of the polymer. The diene may polymerize by either 1,2- addition or 1,4- addition. The degree of 1,2-addition may be defined by the relative amounts of repeat units of branched alkyl groups (also defined herein as R2). Any initially-formed pendant unsaturated or vinyl groups, upon hydrogenation, become alkyl branches ("branched alkyl groups"). Block A (when not in a tapered copolymer) may contain from 20 mol % to 80 mol %, or 25 mol % to 75 mol %, or 30 mol % to 70 mol %, or 40 mol % to 65 mol % of repeat units of branched alkyl groups. A tapered copolymer, may contain 40 mol % to 80 mol %, or 50 mol % to 75 mol % of block A containing repeat units of branched alkyl groups (or vinyl groups). The copolymer may be prepared by anionic polymerization techniques. As a person skilled in the art will appreciate, it is believed that anionic polymerization initiators containing alkali metals and/or organometallic compounds are sensitive to interactions between the various metals and the counterion and/or solvent. In order to prepare a polymer with increasing amounts of diene polymerized with a larger amount of 1,2-addition, it is typical to employ a polar solvent (for example tetrahydrofuran). Further employing an initiator with a lower atomic mass is suitable (for example use lithium rather than cesium). In different embodiments butyl lithium or butyl sodium may be used as initiators. Typical anionic polymerization temperatures such as below 0°C, or -20°C or less may be employed. A more detailed description of methods suitable for preparing a polymer with a greater amounts of diene 1,2-addition stereospecificity is found in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, Volume 4, pages 316-317 or in Anionic Polymerisation, Principles and Practical Applications, Edited by Henry L. Hsieh and Roderic P. Quirk, pages 209 and 217, 1996, Marcel Dekker. The olefin polymer block may be formed with a large amount of 1,2-addition (i.e. 5 mol % to 95 mol % of branched groups) by employing the processes or methods described in US Patent Numbers 5,753,778 (discloses in column 3, lines 1 to 33 a process using an alkyllithium initiator for selectively hydrogenating a polymer); 5,910,566 (discloses in column 3, lines 13 to 43 a suitable process, solvent and catalyst for hydrogenating a conjugated diene); 5,994,477 (discloses in column 3, line 24 to column 4, line 32 a method for selectively hydrogenating a polymer); 6,020,439 (column 3, lines 30-52 discloses a suitable catalyst); and 6,040,390 (discloses in column 9, lines 2-17 a suitable catalyst). Typically the amount of 1,2-addition disclosed in the Examples of these patents range from 30 to 42 % of the butadiene units). Suitable vinyl aromatic monomers include styrene or alkylstyrene (e.g. alpha-methylstyrene, para-methyl styrene, para-tert-butylstyrene, alpha-ethylstyrene, and para-lower alkoxy styrene). In one embodiment the vinyl aromatic monomer is styrene. The vinyl aromatic monomers (e.g. a substituted styrene) may often be functionalized with a group including acyl groups or halo-, alkoxy-, carboxy, hydroxy-, sulphonyl-, nitro-, nitroso-, and hydrocarbyl-substituents wherein the hydrocarbyl group typically has 1 to 12 carbon atoms. The acyl group may be incorporated into the vinyl aromatic block under thermal grafting conditions, optionally in the presence of a Lewis acid. Suitable Lewis acid catalysts are known in the art and include BF3 and complexes thereof, AlCl3, TiCl4, or SnCl2. Complexes of BF3 include boron trifluoride etherate, boron trifluoride-phenol and boron trifluoride-phosphoric acid. Thermal grafting conditions are known in the art and include a reaction temperature of 0°C to 150°C, or 10°C to 120°C or 50°C to 100°C. The pendant carbonyl-containing group may be derived from alkyl acid halides (typically chlorides), alkyl anhydrides or alkyl-substituted monocarboxylic acids or derivatives thereof. In different embodiments the alkyl group contains 6 to 100, or 8 to 80 or 8 to 50 carbon atoms. Examples of a suitable alkyl group include polyisobutylene, linear or branched dodecyl, tetradecyl or hexadecyl. The weight average molecular weight of the hydrogenated copolymer may be in the range from 1000 to 1,000,000, or 5,000 to 500,000, or 10,000 to 250,000, or 50,000 to 175,000. The polydispersity of the hydrogenated polymer may be in the range from 1 to less than 1.6, or 1 to 1.55, or 1 to 1.4, or 1.01 to 1.2. The hydrogenated copolymer may comprise a backbone derived from 5 to 70 mol %, or 10 mol % to 60 mol %, or 20 mol % to 60 mol % of the alkenylarene monomer e.g., styrene. The hydrogenated copolymer may comprise a backbone derived from 30 to 95 mol %, or 40 mol % to 90 mol %, or 40 mol % to 80 mol % of an olefin monomer, typically a diene, e.g., butadiene. The hydrogenated copolymer is a block copolymer and may include regular, random, tapered or alternating architectures. The block copolymer may be either a di-block AB copolymer, or a tri-block ABA copolymer. Often the polymer is a di-block AB copolymer. In one embodiment the polymer is other than a tapered copolymer.

The X and Y groups may be grafted onto the polymer backbone under free radical conditions. The free radical conditions are known and include a reaction temperature of 20°C to 200°C, or 60°C to 160°C. The R2 group, containing alkyl or -alkyl-Z groups, may also be defined as a vinyl group prior to hydrogenation. The 1,2- addition produces a vinyl group or branching group. The number of carbons present on an unsubstituted R2 may be from 1 to 8, or 1 to 4, or about 2. When R2 is further substituted, e.g., with a pendant carbonyl containing group, the number of carbon atoms on R2 increases by the number of carbon atoms present in the pendant carbonyl containing group. The Z group of the -alkyl-Z and/or the Y group may be grafted onto the vinyl or branched group or backbone under ene-reaction conditions. The ene-reaction conditions are known and include a reaction temperature of 60°C to 220°C, or 100°C to 200°C. R3 may be derived from vinyl aromatic monomers, or mixtures thereof.

The hydrogenated copolymer may be a diblock sequential block copolymer, or a diblock normal diblock copolymer. In one embodiment the hydrogenated copolymer is not a triblock or higher block copolymer. In one embodiment the hydrogenated copolymer comprises a backbone derived from styrene and butadiene. Commercially available copolymers of styrene and butadiene (i.e. an unfunctionalized copolymer with X, Y and Z groups defined as hydrogen from formulae above) with 5 mol % to 95 mol % of butadiene reacted by 1,2- addition include Lubrizol®7408A.

Typically the nitrogen-containing group reacts with the pendant carbonyl-containing group. Suitable amines include aliphatic, aromatic or non-aromatic amines. The amine functional group may be (i) bonded to a pendant carbonyl containing group, e.g., a carboxylic acid to form an imide or amide functionality, or (ii) the amine may be bonded directly onto the olefin block polymer (block A). In different embodiments the amine functional group may be derived from a nitrogen-containing monomer, and/or an amine with a primary and/or secondary nitrogen.

Examples of other suitable aromatic amines include amino-substituted aromatic compounds and amines in which the amine nitrogen is a part of an aromatic ring, such as 3-aminoquinoline, 5-aminoquinoline, and 8-aminoquinoline. Also included are aromatic amines such as 2-aminobenzimidazole, which contains one secondary amino group attached directly to the aromatic ring and a primary amino group attached to the imidazole ring. Other amines include N-(4-anilinophenyl)-3-aminobutanamide or 3-amino propyl imidazole. Yet other amines include 2,5-dimethoxybenzylamine Additional aromatic amines and related compounds are disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,107,257 and 6,107,258; some of these include aminocarbazoles, benzoimidazoles, aminoindoles, aminopyrroles, amino-indazolinones, mercaptotriazoles, aminophenothiazines, aminopyridines, aminopyrazines, aminopyrimidines, pyridines, pyrazines, pyrimidines, aminothiadiazoles, aminothiothiadiazoles, and aminobenzotriaozles. Other suitable amines include 3-amino-N-(4-anilinophenyl)-N-isopropyl butanamide, and N-(4-anilinophenyl)-3-{(3-aminopropyl)-(cocoalkyl)-amino} butanamide. Other aromatic amines which can be used include various aromatic amine dye intermediates containing multiple aromatic rings linked by, for example, amide structures. Examples include materials of the general structure and isomeric variations thereof, where Rviii and Rix are independently alkyl or alkoxy groups such as methyl, methoxy, or ethoxy. In one instance, Rviii and Rix are both -OCH3 and the material is known as Fast Blue RR [CAS# 6268-05-9]. In another instance, Rix is -OCH3 and Rviii is -CH3, and the material is known as Fast Violet B [99-21-8]. When both Rviii and Rix are ethoxy, the material is Fast Blue BB [120-00-3]. U.S. Patent 5,744,429 discloses other aromatic amine compounds, particularly aminoalkyl-phenothiazines. N-aromatic substituted acid amide compounds, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent application 2003/0030033 A1, may also be used for the purposes of this invention. Suitable aromatic amines include those in which the amine nitrogen is a substituent on an aromatic carboxyclic compound, that is, the nitrogen is not sp2 hybridized within an aromatic ring. The aromatic amine will typically have an N-H group capable of condensing with the pendant carbonyl containing group. Certain aromatic amines are commonly used as antioxidants. Of particular importance in that regard are alkylated diphenylamines such as nonyldiphenylamine and dinonyldiphenylamine. To the extent that these materials will condense with the carboxylic functionality of the polymer chain, they are also suitable for use within the present invention. However, it is believed that the two aromatic groups attached to the amine nitrogen may lead to steric hindrance and reduced reactivity. Thus, suitable amines include those having a primary nitrogen atom (-NH2) or a secondary nitrogen atom in which one of the hydrocarbyl substituents is a relatively short chain alkyl group, e.g., methyl. Among such aromatic amines are 4-phenylazoaniline, 4-aminodiphenylamine, 2-aminobenzimidazole, and N,N-dimethylphenylenediamine. Some of these and other aromatic amines may also impart antioxidant performance to the polymers, in addition to dispersancy and other properties. In one embodiment of the invention, the amine component of the reaction product further comprises an amine having at least two N-H groups capable of condensing with the carboxylic functionality of the polymer. This material is referred to hereinafter as a "linking amine" as it can be employed to link together two of the polymers containing the carboxylic acid functionality. It has been observed that higher molecular weight materials may provide improved performance, and this is one method to increase the material's molecular weight. The linking amine can be either an aliphatic amine or an aromatic amine; if it is an aromatic amine, it is considered to be in addition to and a distinct element from the aromatic amine described above, which typically will have only one condensable or reactive NH group, in order to avoid excessive crosslinking of the polymer chains. Examples of such linking amines include ethylenediamine, phenylenediamine, and 2,4-diaminotoluene; others include propylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine, and other, ω-polymethylenediamines. The amount of reactive functionality on such a linking amine can be reduced, if desired, by reaction with less than a stoichiometric amount of a blocking material such as a hydrocarbyl-substituted succinic anhydride. In one embodiment the amine comprises nitrogen-containing compounds capable of reacting directly with a polymer backbone. Examples of suitable amines include N-p-diphenylamine 1,2,3,6-tetrahydrophthalimide, 4-anilinophenyl methacrylamide, 4-anilinophenyl maleimide, 4-anilinophenyl itaconamide, acrylate and methacrylate esters of 4-hydroxydiphenylamine, the reaction product of p-aminodiphenylamine or p-alkylaminodiphenylamine with glycidyl methacrylate, the reaction product of p-aminodiphenylamine with isobutyraldehyde, derivatives of p-hydroxydiphenylamine; derivatives of phenothiazine, vinyl-substituted diphenylamines, or mixtures thereof. The nitrogen-containing compound may be directly reacted onto the polymer backbone by grafting of the amine onto the polymer backbone either (i) in a solution using a solvent, or (ii) under reactive extrusion conditions in the presence or absence of solvent. The amine-functional monomer may be grafted onto the polymer backbone in multiple ways. In one embodiment, the grafting takes place by a thermal process via an "ene" reaction. In one embodiment the grafting takes place by a Friedel Crafts acylating reaction. In another embodiment the grafting is carried out in solution or solid form through a free radical initiator. Solution grafting is a well-known method for producing grafted polymers. In such a process, reagents are introduced either neat or as solutions in appropriate solvents. The desired polymer product must sometimes then be separated from the reaction solvents and/or impurities by appropriate purification steps. In one embodiment the nitrogen-containing compound may be directly reacted onto the polymer backbone by free radical catalysed grafting of the polymer in solvents like benzene, t-butyl benzene, toluene, xylene, or hexane. The reaction may be carried out at an elevated temperature in the range of 100°C to 250°C or 120°C to 230°C, or 160°C to 200°C, e.g., above 160°C, in a solvent, such as a mineral lubricating oil solution containing, e.g., 1 to 50, or 5 to 40 wt. %, based on the initial total oil solution of said polymer and preferably under an inert environment. The molecular weight of the functionalized polymer will be correspondingly somewhat higher than the ranges given above for the polymer. However, the weight average and number weight molecular weights for functionalized polymer may be readily estimated on the basis of the amount and molecular weight of the amine or alcohol. Examples of commercially available hydrogenated copolymers that may be used include LZ® 7408A which is available from Lubrizol, and Dyne® 623-11, Dyne® 623-12 and Dyne® 623-14 which are available from Dynasol.

The non-conjugated alkenyl groups may be attached to the same or different electron withdrawing groups such as an aromatic nucleus. The polyalkenyl coupling agents may be characterized as having the property that at least two of the alkenyl groups are capable of independent reaction with different polymer groups. The polyalkenyl coupling agents may be aliphatic, cyclic or aromatic. The polyalkenyl coupling agent may include one or more polyvinyl benzenes, for example, divinyl benzene. The number of arms attached to the core may be in the range from 3 to 12, or from 6 to 10, or from 7 to 9, or from 7 to 8. Hydrogenation of the radial polymer may be accomplished using any of the techniques known in the art. In general, these techniques may involve the use of a suitable catalyst, particularly a catalyst or catalyst precursor comprising a Group VI or Group VIII metal atom. The radial polymer may be hydrogenated at from 90 to 100%, or from 98 to 100% of the available double bonds (which do not include aromatic unsaturation). The weight average molecular weight each of the arms of the hydrogenated radial polymer may be in the range from 40,000 to 200,000, or from 60,000 to 100,000. The polydispersity of the arms may be in the range from 1.02 to 1.20, or from 1.05 to 1.10. The weight average molecular weight of the radial polymer may be in the range from 300,000 to 2,500,000, or from 500,000 to 1,000,000.

Polymer Blends The hydrogenated copolymer (II) and the radial polymer (III) may be blended together using any polymer blending procedure. These polymers may be co-extruded. These polymers may be blended by dispersing them in a blend or diluent oil. The weight ratio of the copolymer (II) to the radial polymer (III) may be from 90:10 to 10:90, or from 90:10 to 50:50, or from 80:20 to 70:30, or 80:20. The SSI for the polymer blend may be in the range from 0 to 40, or from 5 to 30, or from 10 to 20, or from 12 to 18.

Typically, fully-formulated lubricating oil will contain one or more of these performance additives. Dispersants Dispersants are often known as ashless-type or ashless dispersants because, prior to mixing in a lubricating oil composition, they do not contain ash-forming metals and they do not normally contribute any ash forming metals when added to a lubricant and polymeric dispersants. Ashless type dispersants are characterized by a polar group attached to a relatively high molecular weight hydrocarbon chain. Typical ashless dispersants include N-substituted long chain alkenyl succinimides. Examples of N-substituted long chain alkenyl succinimides include polyisobutylene succinimide with number average molecular weight of the polyisobutylene substituent in the range 350 to 5000, or 500 to 3000. Succinimide dispersants and their preparation are disclosed, for instance in US Patent 4,234,435.

The dithiocarbamate-containing compounds may be prepared by reacting a dithiocarbamate acid or salt with an unsaturated compound. The dithiocarbamate containing compounds may also be prepared by simultaneously reacting an amine, carbon disulphide and an unsaturated compound. Generally, the reaction occurs at a temperature of 25°C to 125°C. US Patents 4,758,362 and 4,997,969 describe dithiocarbamate compounds and methods of making them.
