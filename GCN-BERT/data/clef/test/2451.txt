CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application is a 371 U.S. National Stage of International Application No. PCT/NO2011/000253, filed on Sep. 15, 2011, which claims priority to Norwegian Patent Application No. 20101289 filed on Sep. 15, 2010, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety as if fully set forth herein. The present invention relates to an improved ski binding for touring or cross-country skiing. As is well known by any manufacturer of ski bindings, as well as most users of ski bindings, a ski binding should comprise of as few functional parts as possible to functionally flawless in use when exposed to repetitive stress, snow, ice and water entering and freezing within the binding. Moreover, less functional parts allows easier assembly and lower production cost of the binding. To further reduce production cost while simultaneously offering a high quality binding to a customer at acceptable sale price, is it advantageously to allow most or all of the assembly of the parts of the binding to be performed in a fully automatic process. The fewer manual operations required, the less expensive the binding becomes. Currently there exists a very large amount of ski bindings on the market, and a substantial number of these bindings is based on the well-known NNN norm, i.e. for use with ski shoes that has a transversal engagement pin mounted underneath the front of the sole of the ski shoe, the binding engaging the engagement pin at either end of the engagement pin or parts of the engagement pin. Several of these ski bindings is constructed in a way that requires several manual and/or complicated automated operations to able to assemble the different parts of the binding. In particular, in an automated assembly operation it is disadvantageous to allow operations performed from different directions, i.e. some operation in a vertical direction, some in a horizontal direction as well as at an angle relative to these directions. Also, rotating an constructional part or element could complicate or add further complexity or cost of the required equipment. Operations in several directions to assemble parts could therefore include joining certain parts either manual or in different position prior to the in-line part assembly. Most touring and cross-country ski bindings on the market today includes some kind of biasing means providing a return biasing force on the rotation of the ski shoe. A very common biasing means is a resilient element positioned in front of and adjacent to the toe of a ski shoe. The front resilient element experiences a large compressive force as well as an upwards lifting force by the toe of the shoe due to the rotational movement of the shoe as the heel of the ski shoe is rotated toward it highest position. It is a common problem for ski bindings of prior art that the repetitive upwards lifting force at some point pulls the resilient element out of its housing. Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide a ski binding that comprises a resilient element, that are easy to assemble; and has simple, yet secure fastening means for the resilient element. The ski binding according to the present invention is defined by claim 1 and accompanying dependent claims 2-5. An aspect of the present invention relates to a touring or cross-country binding comprising: an engagement section 2.1 for pivotal engagement of a ski shoe engagement pin 21;a first housing section 9 provided with an opening 9.2 adapted to receive the engagement section 2.1;at least one resilient element 10 fastenable in front of the engagement section 2.1; anda second housing section 7 connected to the first housing section 9, wherein the resilient element 10 is provided with at least one rear flange 10.1 extending from a rear lower section of the element, wherein the at least one rear flange extends to a position under a bottom surface of the first housing section 9.

FIG. 1 illustrates a ski binding 2,3 fixed to the upper surface of a ski 1, where the ski binding comprises a front element having an engagement section 2.1 for pivotal engagement of a ski shoe engagement pin 21, and a rear binding element 3 for engagement with a slit in the underside of the heel of the ski shoe. The front and rear elements of the ski binding also appears from FIG. 2. The ski have on its upper surface a ski binding fastening base element 1.1, e.g. a so called NIS-plate, to which the front and rear binding elements 2,3 can be releasable fastened by snap fastening. Also, by utilizing such an element 1.1 adjustable positioning of the elements 2,3 along the ski becomes possible to adjust to the ski shoe size and the substantially vertical load on the ski. The base element 1.1 can be fastened to or integrated with a ski 1. Alternatively, could the elements 2,3 be fastened to the ski by use of regular screws or other fastening means could be used. Now with reference to FIG. 3 showing an exploded view of the ski binding. The engagement section 2.1 of the binding includes a first stationary engagement part 4 and a movable engagement part 5. A spring-loaded activation element 6 is also provided to move the movable engagement part 5 between a locking position and a release position of the ski shoe. Further, a second housing section 7 exists having a bottom 7.1 and a pair of side elements 7.2 extending from the bottom 7.1 and providing bearing surfaces 7.3 for the fulcrum pins 6.1 of the activation element 6. The stationary engagement part 4 includes a base 4.1 and a pair of protruding elements 4.2, which at top have recesses 4.3 to provide the engagement section 2.1, as shown in more detail in FIG. 10-20. The movable engagement part 5 is a slider in sliding engagement with the stationary engagement part 4 and in sliding engagement with slider guides 7.4 of the second housing section 7. The movable engagement part 5 includes at a rear area thereof a pair of protruding locking elements 5.1, e.g. hook shaped elements, extending from a base 5.2 of the movable engagement part 5. Each locking element 5.1 in locking position for the movable engagement part 5 is positioned sideways in relation to adjacent recess 4.3 on the stationary engagement section 4 to provide in co-operation with said recess 4.3 a means for locking the engagement pin 21, see FIGS. 11, 13, 15, 17 and 20. Each locking element 5.1 in ski shoe releasing position of the movable engagement part 5 is positioned forward in relation to the adjacent recess 4.3 of the stationary engagement part 4, that is, displaced from the recess 4.3 in the lengthwise direction of the binding, see FIGS. 12, 14, 16 and 18. Activation element 6 includes a button 6.2 extending downwards to directly engage an forward positioned opening 5.3 in the slider, whereby the slider 5 is slided forward to a releasing position by a downwards pushing operation on the activation element 6 at a position behind its fulcrum pins 6.1. A lower edge 6.4 of each sidewall of the activation element, at a position below the fulcrum pins 6.1, is curved. The curved lower edge 6.4 sits on a neighboring surface of the base 5.2 of the slider shaped movable engagement part 5 to reduce the stress on the fulcrum pins 6.1. A spring 8 is positioned between an abutment 7.5 at the bottom 7.1 of the second housing section 7 and an abutment 5.4 on the slider shaped movable engagement part 5 to provide spring loading of the movable engagement part 5 and the activation element 6. As illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 10-16, the stationary engagement part 4 is positioned under the slider shaped movable engagement part 5 and rests on the bottom 7.1 of the first housing section, whereby the movable engagement part 5 at its front area is sliding on top of the bottom 7.1 of the second housing section 7 and at its rear area slides on top of the stationary engagement section 4. In the alternative illustrated in FIGS. 17 and 18, the stationary engagement part 4 is positioned above the slider shaped movable engagement section 5, and the stationary engagement section 4 has feet or other types of fastening means (not clearly shown) resting on the bottom 7.1 of the second housing section 7, whereby the movable engagement part 5 on its underside is sliding on the bottom 7.1 of the second housing section 7 and with its upper surface of its rear area sliding connects with a underside surface of the stationary engagement part 4. The element 6 acts as a release mechanism, and due to the button 6.2 co-operating with opening 5.3 of the movable engagement part 5, and the part 5 is spring-loaded by the spring 8, element 6 is also spring-loaded. It should be noted that the outside of engagement pocket 7.5 constitute one of the guides 7.4 for part 5. An important aspect of the present invention is that element 6 is arranged to directly exert a force on the movable engagement section 5, that in reality constitutes a ski shoe fastening element. By activation of the release element 6 by exertion of a release force, e.g. by utilizing the pointed end of a ski pole; on position 6.2, is a substantial stress applied the fulcrum pins 6.1 from the bearing surfaces 7.3 on the side elements 7.2 provided a remedy is provided to reduce such stress. To avoid breakage in the release mechanism, i.e. fulcrum pins 6.1, as a result of substantial vertical release force, represents the provision of the curved bottom edge 6.4 to ride the adjacent surface of the base 5.2 of the slider shaped movable engagement part 5, that the vertically directed stress component exerted on the fulcrum pins is substantially reduced, and the smaller stress component working in the vertical direction on the fulcrum pins, will have an acceptable value. Hence, the stress exerted on the fulcrum pins will be within fully acceptable limits. The risk of malfunction is with that removed. It should also be envisaged that when element 6 via its button 6.2 displaces the movable engagement part 5 in a forwards direction, the curved bottom edge 6.4 by frictional contact with the base 5.2 of the part 5 assist the operation of the button 6.2. FIG. 21 illustrates the sole of a ski shoe or ski boot wherein the front area of the sole comprises an engagement pin 21 attached to the ski binding 2, whereby the engagement pin is lies in the engagement section 2.1 and is locked by locking element 5.1. As indicated in the exploded view of FIG. 3 is a second housing part 9 provided, the first housing section 9 being adapted to snap connection from above on the second housing section 7. The first housing section 9 has at a front area thereof a pair of recesses 9.1 for pivotal engagement with an upper part of the fulcrum pins 6.1. The first housing section 9, at the position of the protruding elements 4.2, 5.1 of the stationary and movable engagement parts 4, 5, an opening 9.2. The first housing section 9 effects that the fulcrum pins 6.1 of the element 6 is limited in upwards movement, and also effects that the stationary and movable engagement element 5, 6 is limited in upwards movement. Further, as illustrated in FIG. 3, at least one resilient elements 10, 11 is fastenable to the first housing section 9, where at least one resilient element is fastenable in front of or behind the engagement section 2.1 for pivotal engagement of the ski shoe. The front resilient elements 10 is preferably fastenable to the first housing section 9 from underneath the first housing section 9. The behind, or rear, resilient element 11 is fastenable to the second housing section from above by snap connection. Now also with reference to FIGS. 22a-22c, the front resilient element of the present invention is provided with at least one rear flange 10.1 extending from a rear lower section of the element. The at least one rear flange extends under the first housing section 9 when the resilient element is mounted in the opening 9.2 of the first housing section 9, such that the resilient element is kept in position by a bottom surface of the first housing section 9. To further secure the resilient element the rear flange can also be provided with an opening adapted to engage a pin, where the pin is positioned on the bottom surface of the first housing section 9 or on a upper surface of the second housing section 7. The front resilient element is also provided with a left 10.2 and right flange 10.3 provided on the left and right side, respectively, of the resilient element. The flanges are adapted to fit into correspondingly shaped seats in the first housing section 9. As illustrated in FIG. 3, these left and right flanges are further provided with openings adapted to engage respective pins on the bottom surface of the first housing section 9 or on an upper surface of the second housing section 7. An exemplary second housing section 7, also illustrated in FIG. 3, shows three resilient element engagement pins 7.5, 7.6, 7.7 arranged on the second housing section 7, respectively adapted to engage the rear flange 10.1, left flange 10.2 and right flange 10.3. According to yet an exemplary embodiment of the present invention the front resilient element is further provided with an traversal flange 10.4 extending from the rear lower section of the resilient element 10, wherein the upper surface of the traversal flange 10.4 is substantially in level with the upper surface of the first housing section 9 adjacent to the opening 9.2 when the resilient element is mounted in the second housing section. In the assembled ski binding illustrated in FIG. 4a, the traversal flange 10.4 covers the ski shoe engagement pin reception area 9.3, such that when in use, during the forward rotation of a ski shoe, downwards and backwards forces are exerted on the traversal flange 10.4 by the ski shoe engagement pin 21. Further, according to another exemplary aspect of the present invention, the engagement section 2.1 of the assembled ski binding comprises a pair of locking elements 5.1 that in the locking position extends over the outer ends 10.5, 10.6 of the traversal flange 10.4, such that the front resilient element is fixed in position by the pair of locking elements 5.1. The elements 12, 13 in FIG. 3 is only plates of decorative and cover purposes and have no further functionality. As is understood from viewing FIG. 3, the second housing section 7, the stationary engagement part 4, the movable engagement part 5, the spring 8, the activation element 6, and the first housing section 9, all capable of being assembled by successive vertical directed mounting steps.
