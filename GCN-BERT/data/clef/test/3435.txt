Preparation of 3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl trifluoromethane sulfonate
3-((Tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (1.92 g, 3.98 mmol) was added to a solution of (R)-3-(2-aminopropyl)-2-methylaniline (0.784 g, 4.77 mmol) and DIPEA (1.031 ml, 5.97 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (15 ml). The reaction was heated at 85Â° C. for 18 hours. After cooling, the reaction was diluted with DCM and washed with water. The aqueous layer was extracted with DCM, and the combined organic layers were dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 4% methanolic ammonia in DCM. Pure fractions were concentrated to dryness to afford (R)-3-(2-((3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline (1.97 g, 100%) as a yellow oil.
