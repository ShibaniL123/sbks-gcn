Example 4: di[p-(dimethylcarbamoylamino)phenyl]phenyl phosphate (HA-IV)
HA-IV corresponds to a compound according to Formula (I) with m=2; n=1; p=0; X=O; R1=R2=methyl; R3=-O-phenyl; R6=H, wherein the -NHC(O)NR1R2 group is in the p-position.
28.83 g (160 mmol) N-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-N',N'-dimethylurea are suspended in 160 ml acetonitrile (100%, VWR) in an N2-washed three-necked flask with a return condenser, dropping funnel, thermometer and magnetic stirrer, 16.19 g (160 mmol) triethylamine (99.5%, Sigma-Aldrich) are added and the mixture being produced is cooled by means of an ice bath to a temperature of 0° C. A solution of 16.88 g (80 mmol) phosphoric acid phenyl ester dichloride (97%, ABCR) in 80 ml acetonitrile is added drop-wise by means of a dropping funnel in such a way that the temperature does not rise above 5° C. Thereafter, the ice bath is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature. The solid produced is separated off, rewashed with a little acetonitrile and dried in air. The solid is then suspended in 200 ml water, stirred at 50° C. for 30 min, separated off again and rewashed again with water. Drying then takes place at 60° C. in a vacuum.
