ΐ TITLE Steam Arm Washer SPECIFICATION DESCRIPTION [0001] The present invention relates generally to cleaning used, dirty steam arms on an foamed milk coffee machine of milk frothing machine. [0002] There are a number of challenges in foaming milk for coffee drinks so as to thoroughly clean the steam arm after every use. [0003] Making great foamed milk is a highly skilled procedure that requires steam arm purging and thorough cleaning after evey operation. Experts typically use a wet rag for this cleaning process. [004] Clean steam arms give a better tasting foamed milk. [0005] Failing to thoroughly clean the steam arm after every use results in milk products progressively building up and forming an unsightly 'milk sausage' on the steam arm. [0006] Steam arms need to be purged with scaldingly hot steam and this is a workplace health hazard. STEAM ARM WASHER OPERATION [0007] The steam arm thoroughly cleans each steam arm automatically after each use. [0008] The steam arm is cleaned with water [0009] The steam arm is cleaned with brushes [0010] The steam arm is purged with hot steam in a safe manner [0011] milk foaming can result in the steam tip becoming blocked if the arm is not purged after each use. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0012] The present invention relates to the need for milk foaming machines to be kept clean, hygienic and of attractive appearance. [0013] The present invention relates to the needs to purge steam arms with scaldingly hot steam in a safe manner. [0014] The present invention relates to the needs to automate functions that are currently done manually and in a manner that poses a burns risk to the operator. [0015] This innovation vastly improves and makes more consistent steam arm cleanliness which means that the milk foaming machine owner can employ less specialized foamed milk makers at a lower cost and still get a great quality result. ΐ TITLE Steam Arm Washer [0016] This invention finds an innovative way to purge steam arms with hot steam in a safe manner.[0017] This innovative method of cleaning steam arms addresses and solves the thorough cleaning problem.[0018] This innovative method of cleaning steam arms addresses and solves problem of steam tip blockages.[0019] Cleaner and more hygienic cleaning of steam arms means that the output quality is better with lower cost, less specialized foamed milk making staff.[0020] Thorough cleaning reduces wastage of milk.[0021] This innovation dramatically standardizes the cleaning of steam arms required after every use.[0022] This innovation standardizes and automates a milk foaming function that is currently un-standardized and manual.
