CHITI -GLUCAN COMPLEX, ITS PREPARATION, AND USES This application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/001,306, filed May 21, 2014, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Throughout this application, various publications are referenced, including referenced in parenthesis. Full citations for publications referenced in parenthesis may be found listed at the end of the specification immediately preceding the claims. The disclosures of all referenced publications in their entireties, are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art to, which this invention pertains . BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Pharmaceutical tablets and capsules often contain one or more excipients which act as binders, fillers, disintegrants , diluents, lubricants, preservatives, and/or antioxidants. Powdered excipients can be used to bulk up a drug formulation in order to allow for accurate dispensation of the active pharmaceutical ingredient when producing a dosage form. Powder flow is a critical component for the manufacture of pharmaceutical tablets and capsules (Shah 2008) . For example, tablets are often manufactured on a rotary multi- station tablet press by filling the tablet die with powder from a hopper based on volume. Capsules are also filled based upon powder volume. The rate of discharge (M) from a hopper for a free flowing powder can be calculated by the empirical equation = ^pbjD5g2 tan a , where pb is the bulk density of the powder, D is the opening diameter of the hopper, and is the angle of the hopper walls (Holdich 2002) . Thus, the rate of discharge from a hopper increases with increasing bulk density of the powder. Higher discharge rates allow for higher machine speeds and greater productivity. New pharmaceutical excipients having high bulk densities allowing for increased machine speeds and higher productivity are needed.

Natural biocomposite suitable for the production of the biocomposite powder of the present invention can be extracted from K. pastoris biomass using, for example, the procedures described in WO 2013/140222 or by the procedures described herein . In some embodiments, the natural biocomposite is extracted from K. pastoris biomass by first contacting the K. pastoris biomass with a 0.2 to 5.0 M alkaline aqueous solution to form a biomass suspension. In some embodiments, the alkaline aqueous solution is NaOH, KOH, Ca(OH)2, Na2C03, K2CO3, CaC03, NaHC03, or KHCO3. In some embodiments, the alkaline aqueous solution is a solution of NaOH or NaHC03.

The biomass suspension can be mixed for 1-5 hours at a temperature of 60-70°C. In some embodiments, the suspension is stirred for 2 hours at a temperature of 65 °C. The reaction mixture is then cooled, optionally mixed with a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution, and neutralized by the addition of acid (for example HC1) to form an alkaline soluble and alkaline insoluble fraction. In some embodiments, the reaction mixture is cooled to a temperature of 30-45°C. In some embodiments, the PBS solution comprises 20.45 g/L NaCl, 0.46 g/L KC1 , 10.14 g/L Na2HP04«7H20, and 0.54 g/L KH2P04, pH 7.2. The alkaline soluble fraction is then separated from the alkaline insoluble fraction. In some embodiments, the alkaline soluble fraction is separated from the alkaline insoluble fraction by centrifugation, filtration, or sedimentation. Following separation, one or more of the following washings can be performed on the alkaline insoluble fraction: i. a water wash which is repeated until the pH and the conductivity of the mixture are between 5.0 and 8.0, and below 50 uS/cm, respectively; ii. a wash with an aqueous saline solution, such as, for example, phosphate buffered saline (PBS) comprising 20.45 g/L NaCl ; 0.46 g/L KC1 ; 10.14 g/L Na2HP04 · 7H20 or 6.612 g/L Κ2ΗΡΟ4 and 0.54 g/L KH2P04, pH 7.2, which is repeated until the pH of the mixture is between 5.0 and 8.0; iii. a wash with acetone, an alcohol, or an aqueous solution thereof.

Depending on the drying procedure used, the dried natural biocomposite will be obtained in forms ranging from low -density/high volume foams to high density/compact pellets, which are used to modulate the physical properties. Milling procedure for preparation of the natural biocomposite powder The natural biocomposite powder of the invention can be prepared by any method known in the art for the production of powders or granules, such as fluidized bed granulation, high shear granulation, spray drying or wet granulation. In an embodiment, the dried biocomposite is milled and granulated by any industrial fragmentation and disintegrating equipment used to obtain granules and known by the people skilled in the art, such as hammer, roller, knife, blade, or disks. The granulators used in this process can be low shear, like for instance fluid-bed granulator, medium shear or high shear granulators . In some embodiments of the invention, biocomposite dried in an aerated oven at temperatures between 40 and 100 °C is milled by passing through a comminuting mill equipped with knife impact rotor and a sieve ranging from 0.25 mm to 10 mm in the output, preferably a sieve ranging from 0.25 to 1.0 mm in the output. In some embodiments, the material obtained is processed a second time in the same equipment with a sieve ranging from 0.25 mm to 5 mm, preferably a sieve ranging from 0.25 mm to 0.5 mm. In some embodiments, the resulting granulate is passed through an oscillating and rotating sieve mill with a sieve ranging from 0.0125 to 2.5 mm. In some embodiments, dried biocomposite is micronized by passing through a mechanical impact mill (e.g. Fitzmill® Communitor, Fitzpatrick) equipped with a 5-15 mm sieve aperture. In some embodiments, the sieve has a 9 mm square aperture. In some embodiments, the material obtained is processed through the mill a second time but with a sieve having an aperture smaller than the aperture of the sieve used in the first pass. In some embodiments, the sieve used in the second pass has a 2.3 mm square aperture. In some embodiments, the dried natural biocomposite is milled by passing through a Cone Mill, equipped with a conical or V rotor, and a sieve ranging from 0.25 mm to 10 mm in the output, preferably a sieve ranging from 0.25 to 1.0 mm in the output. The rotor speeds used can range from 500 rpm to 5000 rpm. In some embodiments, the natural biocomposite is milled by passing through a Ball Mill. The rotor speeds used can range from 500 rpm to 1500 rpm. In some embodiments, the natural biocomposite can be milled by passing through a Multi Mill. The rotor speeds used can range from 500 rpm to 5000 rpm. In some embodiments, the natural biocomposite is dried by freeze drying or by spray drying or fluidized bed drying or by conical dryer, and is passed through a roller compactor also known as a chilsonator, for instance the Chilsonator® IR520, once or twice, or as many times as considered sufficient, to obtain the powder of interest. The powder obtained by any of the methods described above is calibrated by any of the calibration methods used by the person skilled in the art, such as screening on successive sieves followed by gravimetric measurements. For instance, the particles can be calibrated in an oscillating and rotating sieve mill equipped with a sieve ranging from 0.05 mm to 1.5 mm. In some embodiments, a biocomposite powder is sieved in a tower of sieves stacked on top of one another in ascending degree of coarseness. In these embodiments, the powder is charged in the largest aperture sieve. After a vibration period, each granulometric size fraction is collected from the correspondent sieve. In some embodiments, sieves having aperture sizes of 212 μτη, 160 μτη, 100 μπι, 75 μττι, and/or 40 μπι are used to separate a biocomposite powder of the invention into fractions having a size of greater than 212 μηι, less than 212 μπι, less than 160 μτη, less than 100 μιη, less than 75 μπ, and/or less than 40 μτη. In some embodiments, 212 μπι, 160 μπι, 100 μπι, 75 μτη, and 40 μπ\ sieves are used to make fractions of particles having a size greater than 212 μιη, 160-212 μπι, 100- 160 μιη, 75-100 μπι, 40-75 μτη, and less than 40 μπι. In some embodiments, smaller or larger aperture sieves are used to produce fractions of different sizes as desired. For example, one or more sieves having a aperture of 25, 50, 80, 90, 125, 150, 180, 200, 250 and/or larger than 250 μτη can be used to prepare fractions of the desired particle size. The natural biocomposite powder of the present invention is characterized by particles with the minimum possible porosity, preferably less than 2.5%, which is controlled by adjusting the parameters of the drying process, such as drying speed, time and temperature. The particles shape may be spherical or cylindrical or even laminated, depending on the combination of procedures performed previously, but the final shape will preferably be spherical.

Example 1: Production of a high bulk density biocomposite CGC was extracted from Komagataella pastoris biomass grown on glycerol in a fed-batch mode, as described in WO 2013/140222. The extraction procedure involved subjecting the biomass to alkaline conditions (NaOH 1M) at 65°C, for 2h. Afterwards, the alkaline insoluble material (AIM) was separated from the alkaline soluble fraction. The AIM was washed with PBS solution (pH 7.2), water and methanol. Finally, the polymer was dried at 40°C for 24h. The CGC thus obtained had a chitin- glucan molar ratio between 26.8:73.2 and 38.2:61.8. The polymer also had a mannose content of 10.50±1.11 wt%, a protein content of 4.14±0.05 wt%, and a total inorganic salts content of 44.21±5.85 wt%. Example 2: Sub- fractionation of the biocomposite of Example 1 The biocomposite of Example 1 processed two times using a mechanical impact mill (Fitzmill® Comminutor, Fitzpatrick) . The impact mill was equipped with a sieve having a 9 mm square aperture in the first pass and a 2.34 mm sieve in the second pass. The powder was collected and sieved using a tower of 212 Um, 160 m, 100 ]im, 75 μπ\, and 40 μπι sieves stacked on top of one another in ascending degree of coarseness. The powder was charged in the largest aperture at the top of the tower and the tower was vibrated with an amplitude of 1.5 mm for 10 minutes each run. , The powder fractions were then collected from each sieve. The granulometric distribution of the powder was as follows. Table 3 : Granulometric distribution of the biocomposite powder . The results in Table 3 are shown graphically in Figure 1. Bulk density, tapped density, and Carr Index values were determined for several samples of the biocomposite powder prior to sieving. Parameter Unit Value Bulk Density (g/mL) 0.87+0.11 Tapped lOOx (g/mL) 1.00±0.11 Carr Index 13.26±3.29 Table 4 Bulk Density (g/raL) , Tapped Density (g/mL) , and Carr Index values of samples of the biocomposite powder prior to sieving Example 3 : Rheological characterization of the biocomposite powder The biocomposite powder from Example 1 and its sub- fractions from Example 2 were analyzed to determine their physical properties using a FT4 powder rheometer (Freeman Technology, Gloucestershire, UK) . The FT4 powder rheometer calculates the energy needed to make a powder flow as a twisted blade rotates and moves down and up through the powder at a defined helix angle and speed. Overview of FT4 experiments Stability A friable powder that is prone to attrition (breaking down of particles) under the stresses imposed during flow, can exhibit different flow properties at the start of the test to those at the end, due to the changes in particle size and particle shape . Instability may occur for other reasons also and powders that are cohesive and compressible may become caked or agglomerated during flow and as a result change their flow properties during a series of tests. Therefore, the recommended starting point when measuring a powder for the first time is the Stability (Rep) program, which runs the powder through a series of identical measurements. If the powder is stable, then the result from each measurement is similar. However, if the powder changes for any reason then a trend reflecting this change is usually observed. A stability index can be calculated from these measurements : , . , . , , Energy Test 7 Stability J Index SI = - E—nerag*y Test 1 When SI « 1, the powder is robust and not greatly affected by being made to flow. When SI > 1, the powder is affected by being made to flow. Possible causes of a SI > 1 include de- aeration, agglomeration, segregation, moisture uptake, and electrostatic charge. When SI < 1, the powder is also affected by being made to flow. Possible causes of a SI < 1 include attrition, de-agglomeration, over blending of an additive, and coating of the vessel and blade by additive. Understanding which factors contribute to the trend observed needs to be gained with reference to what is known about the powder. For example, if the particles are small and the powder bulk cohesive, then it is possible that the powder may become agglomerated, de-aerated or caked. However, if it is known that the powder has a wide particle size distribution, it is possible that the instability is due to segregation, rather than agglomeration. Small changes (0.9 < SI < 1.1) are normal for most powders and are to be expected. It is recommended that further work be carried out to understand an unstable characteristic only if the SI is outside this range. Variable Flow Rate Method The rate at which powders are handled and moved thorough any given process will vary from point to point. Even the most basic transfer systems will require the powder to flow at reduced rates in some places and at high rates elsewhere. The sensitivity of a powder to flow rate is usually an important parameter when describing its flow properties. It is common that cohesive powders are more sensitive to changes in flow rate than non-cohesive or granular materials, mainly as a result of the high air content in the cohesive materials. The variable flow rate program begins by subjecting the powder to a standard flow rate of 100 mm/s while measuring the flow energy. For subsequent tests the flow rate is reduced and the affect on the rheology is measured. This is typically carried out at 4 flow rates (see Figure 2) . The data obtained from the stability and variable flow rate programs are used to assign the following parameters to the powder : Basic Flowability Energy (BFE) = Energy Test 7 Energy Test 7 Stability Index (SI) ,= Energy Test 1 Energy Test 11 Flow Rate Index = Energy Test 8 Results A comparison of the Stability (friability) of particles in function of the attrition and the resistance they have to be moved (Variable Flow Rate) was made between the following powders : • CGC - initial - Biocomposite powder before sub- fractioning . • CGC Sub-fraction - 212um - Sub-fraction containing particles above 212 μπα. • CGC Sub- fraction - lOOum - Sub-fraction containing particles between 100 μτη and 160 μπι. CGC Sub- fraction - 75um - Sub- fraction containing particles between 75 μιη and 100 μπι. • Avicel® PH 302 - High density microcrystalline cellulose marketed for the production of tablets by direct compression • Prosolv® Easy Tab - Commercialized ready to use mix of powders for direct compression with 96.5% of Avicel® PH 102 The bulk density of five of these powders is shown in Table 5. Table 5: Bulk Density The results of the comparison are shown in Figure 2 and Table 6. Table 6: Results From the bottom to top of Figure 2, there was an increase of the Basic Fluidization Energy (BFE) . BFE is the minimal energy necessary to move the particles in each powder. These results provide information about the flowability of each powder. High bulk density powders and/or roughness of their particles increase the BFE. In CGC powders the BFE increases with the particle size. Except for CGC Sub-fraction 1 - 212μπι, all lines of Figure 2 are more or less parallel to X axis, which shows that all powders tested were stable. This also means that the powders do not produce small particles by attrition. There was a reduction in BFE of CGC Sub-fraction - 212 urn, likely because the large particles of this powder became polished after being moved. Avicel® PH 102 had the lowest BFE due to its low density (0.26-0.31 g/cm3) . Prosolv® Easy Tab had the second lowest BFE. Prosolv® Easy Tab is a commercial mixture, specially prepared and ready to use, for direct compression. It is made of 96.5% of Avicel® PH 102 plus lubricants and disintegrants which are smaller powders and are located in the surface of large particles, increasing the powder density and the attrition between large particles when moved . The powder with the next lowest BFE was CGC -initial. It has particles of different diameters below 212 μιη. Because it is a powder with high density the small particles of CGC between large particles produce a lubricating effect which lowers the BFE. The powder with the next lowest BFE was CGC Sub-fraction 75μπι. In this case the high density of whole powder (due to large granules) superimposes to the lubricating effect of small particles (the void volume between large particles is not completed full) . The BFE of Avicel® PH 302 shows less stability because BFE increases with test number. The initial BFE is higher because the attrition of particles and increases with the test number due the erosion of the particles with the concomitant production of fine particles (high friability) . Comparing BFE profiles of CGC Sub-fraction -75μπι and Avicel® PH 302, Avicel® PH 302 has higher BFE (worse flowability) than CGC Sub- fraction - 75 μπι, and Avicel® PH 302 suffers more erosion (produce fine particles) during mobilization than CGC Sub-fraction -75 μπι. CGC Sub-fraction -75 μπι has more robust (and probably smoother) particles which increase powder flowability and reduce powder segregation (separation of fine particles from large particles) . Example 4: Compressibility of sub- fractions Compressibility trials for CGC - initial and CGC sub-fractions were performed using the FT4 powder rheometer. The results of the compressibility trials are shown in Figure 3. Figure 3 shows that CGC Sub-fraction - 40μτη (sub-fraction of Fraction containing particles between 40 μπι and 75 μπι) was the most compressible of the tested sub-fractions. It is expected that CGC Sub-fraction - 40μιη BFE will be higher than CGC Fraction- initial but lower than CGC Sub- fraction -75μπι. Discussion Examples 1-4 show that a biocomposite powder comprising a CGC and having a high bulk density can be prepared from dried CGC biocomposite. Thus, it was discovered that fractionation of the dried biocomposite allows for additional control over the bulk density of the final biocomposite powder. For example, blending of different fractions can be used to provide final CGC products having different bulk densities. The examples also show that the size profile of a final biocomposite product can be manipulated by combining different amounts of sub- fractionated biocomposite powder. Examples 1-4 also show that the high bulk density biocomposite powders of the invention have flowability and stability properties which are comparable to or better than those of the commercial reference products.
