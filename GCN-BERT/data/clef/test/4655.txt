MUSCARINIC AGONISTS FIELD [0001] The present disclosure relates to the fields of chemistry and medicine. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to compounds that affect cholinergic receptors, especially muscarinic receptors, and methods of using such compounds for modulating conditions associated with muscarinic receptors. BACKGROUND [0002] Muscarinic cholinergic receptors mediate many of the actions of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the central and peripheral nervous systems, gastrointestinal system, heart, endocrine glands, lungs, and other tissues. Muscarinic receptors play a central role in the central nervous system for higher cognitive functions, as well as in the peripheral parasympathetic nervous system. Five distinct muscarinic receptor subtypes, referred to as subtypes Μ1-Μ5, have been identified. The Mi subtype is the predominant subtype found in the cerebral cortex in hippocampus and is believed to be involved in the control of cognitive functions; the M2 subtype is the predominant subtype found in heart and is believed to be involved in the control of heart rate; the M2 subtype is also found in brain regions such as cortex and hippocampus where it is predominantly located presynaptically; the M3 subtype is believed to be involved in gastrointestinal and urinary tract stimulation as well as sweating and salivation; the Μ4 subtype is present in the brain and may be involved in locomotion; the Μ5 receptor is present in the brain. Mi and M4 have been particularly associated with the dopaminergic system. [0003] Pilocarpine is a pharmaceutical that has been used to treat glaucoma and to prevent other eye diseases and symptoms thereof. Pilocarpine is recognized as a non-selective muscarinic receptor agonist, and can cause unwanted side effects. Accordingly, there is a need for compounds, such as selective muscarinic agonists, that can increase acetylcholine signaling and/or effect in the brain via activity at specific muscarinic receptor subtypes in the central and peripheral nervous system, both as pharmacological tools and as therapeutic agents.

Thus, the compounds provided herein may be enatiomerically pure or be stereoisomeric mixtures. In addition, it is understood that in any compound having one or more double bond(s) generating geometrical isomers that can be defined as Ε or Ζ each double bond may independently be Ε or Ζ a mixture thereof. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are also intended to be included. [0063] As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to a salt of a compound that does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the compound. Pharmaceutical salts can be obtained by reaction of a compound disclosed herein with an acid or base. Base-formed salts include, without limitation, ammonium salt (ΝΗ4 ); alkali metal, such as, without limitation, sodium or potassium, salts; alkaline earth, such as, without limitation, calcium or magnesium, salts; salts of organic bases such as, without limitation, dicyclohexylamine, N-methyl-D-glucamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine; and salts with the amino group of amino acids such as, without limitation, arginine and lysine. Useful acid-based salts include, without limitation, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, nitrates, phosphates, methanesulfonates, ethanesulfonates, p-toluenesulfonates and salicylates. [0064] Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and hydrates are complexes of a compound with one or more solvent of water molecules, or 1 to about 100, or 1 to about 10, or one to about 2, 3 or 4, solvent or water molecules. [0065] As used herein, a “prodrug” refers to a compound that may not be pharmaceutically active but that is converted into an active drug upon in vivo administration. The prodrug may be designed to alter the metabolic stability or the transport characteristics of a drug, to mask side effects or toxicity, to improve the flavor of a drug or to alter other characteristics or properties of a drug. Prodrugs are often useful because they may be easier to administer than the parent drug. They may, for example, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent drug is not. The prodrug may also have better solubility than the active parent drug in pharmaceutical compositions. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound disclosed herein, which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”) to facilitate absorption through a cell membrane where water solubility is detrimental to mobility but which then is metabolically hydrolyzed to a carboxylic acid (the active entity) once inside the cell where water-solubility is beneficial. A further example of a prodrug might be a short peptide (polyaminoacid) bonded to an acid group where the peptide is metabolized in vivo to release the active parent compound. By virtue of knowledge of pharmacodynamic processes and drug metabolism in vivo, those skilled in the art, once a pharmaceutically active compound is known, can design prodrugs of the compound (see, e.g. Nogrady (1985) Medicinal Chemistry A Biochemical Approach, Oxford University Press, New York, pages 388-392) [0066] As used herein, to “modulate” the activity of a receptor means either to activate it, i.e., to increase its cellular function over the base level measured in the particular environment in which it is found, or deactivate it, i.e., decrease its cellular function to less than the measured base level in the environment in which it is found and/or render it unable to perform its cellular function at all, even in the presence of a natural binding partner. A natural binding partner is an endogenous molecule that is an agonist for the receptor. [0067] An “agonist” is defined as a compound that increases the basal activity of a receptor (i.e. signal transduction mediated by the receptor). [0068] As used herein, “partial agonist” refers to a compound that has an affinity for a receptor but, unlike an agonist, when bound to the receptor it elicits only a fractional degree of the pharmacological response normally associated with the receptor even if a large number of receptors are occupied by the compound. [0069] An “inverse agonist” is defined as a compound, which reduces, or suppresses the basal activity of a receptor, such that the compound is not technically an antagonist but, rather, is an agonist with negative intrinsic activity. [0070] As used herein, “antagonist” refers to a compound that binds to a receptor to form a complex that does not give rise to any response, as if the receptor was unoccupied. An antagonist attenuates the action of an agonist on a receptor. An antagonist may bind reversibly or irreversibly, effectively eliminating the activity of the receptor permanently or at least until the antagonist is metabolized or dissociates or is otherwise removed by a physical or biological process. [0071] As used herein, a “subject” refers to an animal that is the object of treatment, observation or experiment. “Animal” includes cold- and warm-blooded vertebrates and invertebrates such as fish, shellfish, reptiles and, in particular, mammals. “Mammal” includes, without limitation, mice; rats; rabbits; guinea pigs; dogs; cats; sheep; goats; cows; horses; primates, such as monkeys, chimpanzees, and apes, and, in particular, humans. [0072] As used herein, a “patient” refers to a subject that is being treated by a medical professional such as an M.D. or a D.V.M. to attempt to cure, or at least ameliorate the effects of, a particular disease or disorder or to prevent the disease or disorder from occurring in the first place. [0073] As used herein, a “carrier” refers to a compound that facilitates the incorporation of a compound into cells or tissues. For example, without limitation, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a commonly utilized carrier that facilitates the uptake of many organic compounds into cells or tissues of a subject. [0074] As used herein, a “diluent” refers to an ingredient in a pharmaceutical composition that lacks pharmacological activity but may be pharmaceutically necessary or desirable. For example, a diluent may be used to increase the bulk of a potent drug whose mass is too small for manufacture or administration. It may also be a liquid for the dissolution of a drug to be administered by injection, ingestion or inhalation. A common form of diluent in the art is a buffered aqueous solution such as, without limitation, phosphate buffered saline that mimics the composition of human blood. [0075] As used herein, an “excipient” refers to an inert substance that is added to a pharmaceutical composition to provide, without limitation, bulk, consistency, stability, binding ability, lubrication, disintegrating ability etc., to the composition. A “diluent” is a type of excipient. [0076] A "receptor" is intended to include any molecule present inside or on the surface of a cell that may affect cellular physiology when it is inhibited or stimulated by a ligand. Typically, a receptor comprises an extracellular domain with ligand-binding properties, a transmembrane domain that anchors the receptor in the cell membrane, and a cytoplasmic domain that generates a cellular signal in response to ligand binding ("signal transduction"). A receptor also includes any molecule having the characteristic structure of a receptor, but with no identifiable ligand. In addition, a receptor includes a truncated, modified, mutated receptor, or any molecule comprising partial or all of the sequences of a receptor. [0077] "Ligand" is intended to include any substance that interacts with a receptor. [0078] The "Ml receptor" is defined as a receptor having an activity corresponding to the activity of the Ml muscarinic receptor subtype characterized through molecular cloning and pharmacology. [0079] "Selective" or "selectivity" is defined as a compound's ability to generate a desired response from a particular receptor type, subtype, class or subclass while generating less or little response from other receptor types. "Selective" or "selectivity" of one or more particular subtypes of a muscarinic agonist compound means a compound's ability to increase the activity of the subtypes while causing little or no increase in the activity of other subtypes. [0080] As used herein, "coadministration" of pharmacologically active compounds refers to the delivery of two or more separate chemical entities, whether in vitro or in vivo. Coadministration means the simultaneous delivery of separate agents; the simultaneous delivery of a mixture of agents; as well as the delivery of one agent followed by delivery of a second agent or additional agents. Agents that are coadministered are typically intended to work in conjunction with each other. [0081] The term "an effective amount" as used herein means an amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue, system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation or palliation of the symptoms of the disease being treated. Compounds [0082] Disclosed herein are compounds that modulate cholinergic receptors, including muscarinic receptors. In some embodiments, the compounds are agonists of cholinergic receptors. In some embodiments, the compounds have therapeutic effect and can be used to treat disease or conditions such as cognitive dysfunctions such as cognitive impairment, forgetfulness, confusion, memory loss, depression, attentional deficits, deficits in visual perception, and cognitive dysfunctions associated with mental disorders such as neuropsychiatric disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, dementia, age-related cognitive decline, and Down’s syndrome; neuropsychiatric disorders such as sleep disorders, depression, psychosis, hallucinations, aggressiveness, paranoia, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorders, and Gilles de la Tourette’s syndrome; eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia; anxiety disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorders, panic disorders, phobic disorders, general anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorders; mood disorders, such as clinical depression, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder; neurodegenerative disorders and conditions such as alcoholism, Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Huntington’s disease, HIV-associated dementia, Lewy body dementia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, Pick’s disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy; and other diseases and disorders such as pain, such as neuropathic pain; increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, ocular hypertension and other ophthamological conditions such as ocular surface indications and conditions such as dry eye, blepharitis and meibomian gland disease, corneal sensitivity that has been impaired due to surgery on the cornea or other surface of the eye, allergic conjunctivitis and atopic and vernal keratoconjunctivitis, treat ptyregia, ocular symptoms of graft versus host disease, ocular allergy, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, uveitis, anterior uveitis, Behcet’s disease, Sjogren’s syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, chronic ocular surface inflammation caused by viral infection, herpes simplex keratitis, ocular rosacea, and pinguecula.

These diseases/conditions are associated with the cholinergic receptors, such as the muscarinic receptors. [0083] In some embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein have been optimized in order to have good solution stability, i.e.minimal base-catalyzed hydrolysis. Examples of such medical devices are dropper bottle of plastics such as low density polyethylene or polyethylene terephthalate. In some embodiments, the compounds disclosed herein have been developed to have a good systemic metabolic lability without losing ocular efficacy. This generally means that the compounds disclosed herein are easily metabolized once they leave the eye, improving the selectivity for ocular effects. [0084] Consequently the emboidments and aspects disclosed herein includes compounds that have been designed to have targeted properties (such as those disclosed above) compared to other known muscarinic receptor agonists, for example those disclosed in W02006/068904. The compounds herein are thus designed to be muscarinic receptor agonists. [0085] In some embodiments the compounds are Ml agonists, which for example, is shown in Table 1. In some embodiments the compounds are Ml selective agonists. In some embodiments the compounds are Ml agonists with no or low M3 activity. [0086] Some of the compounds disclosed herein have been assayed by for example R-SAT and GTPyS binding. [0087] In some embodiments the compounds should have an Ml pEC50 value of at least 7.5, or at least 8.0, or at least 8.5 as assayed by R-SAT. [0088] In some embodiments the compounds should have an Ml pEC50 value of at least 6.5, or at least 7.0, or at least 7.5 as assayed by GTPyS binding. [0089] In some embodiments the compounds should have a EFF% (percent efficacy) of at least 25, such as at least 30, such as above 30, such as above 40, such as above 50, as assayed by GTPyS binding.

[0115] The compounds disclosed herein may have the ability to increase cholinergic receptor activity or activate cholinergic receptors. Cholinergic receptor activity includes signaling activity or any other activity that is directly or indirectly related to cholinergic signaling or activation. The cholinergic receptors include muscarinic receptors. The muscarinic receptor can be, for example, in the central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, gastrointestinal system, heart, endocrine glands, or lungs. The muscarinic receptor can be a wildtype, truncated, mutated, or modified cholinergic receptor. Kits comprising the compounds disclosed herein for increasing cholinergic receptor activity or activating cholinergic receptors are also contemplated. [0116] The system containing the cholinergic receptor may, for example, be a subject such as a mammal, non-human primate or a human. The system may also be an in vivo or in vitro experimental model, such as a cell culture model system that expresses a cholinergic receptor, a cell-free extract thereof that contains a cholinergic receptor, or a purified receptor. Non-limiting examples of such systems are tissue culture cells expressing the receptor, or extracts or lysates thereof. Cells that may be used in the present method include any cells capable of mediating signal transduction via cholinergic receptors, for example the Mi muscarinic receptor, either via endogenous expression of this receptor (certain types of neuronal cells lines, for example, natively express the Mi receptor), or such as following introduction of the an exogenous gene into the cell, for example, by transfection of cells with plasmids containing the receptor gene. Such cells are typically mammalian cells (or other eukaryotic cells, such as insect cells or Xenopus oocytes), because cells of lower life forms generally lack the appropriate signal transduction pathways for the present purpose. Examples of suitable cells include: the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH 3Τ3 (ATCC CRL 1658), which responds to transfected Mi receptors by increased growth; RAT 1 cells (Pace et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:7031-35 (1991)); and pituitary cells (Vallar et al., Nature 330:556-58 (1987)). Other useful mammalian cells for the present method include but are not limited to ΗΕΚ 293 cells, CHO cells and COS cells. [0117] The compounds disclosed herein also have the ability to reduce intraocular pressure and therefore can be used in the treatment of such diseases as glaucoma. Glaucoma is a disease in which an abnormality is observed in the circulation-control mechanism of the aqueous humor filling up the anterior chamber, i.e., the space formed between the cornea and the lens. This leads to an increase in the volume of the aqueous humor and an increase in intraocular pressure, consequently leading to visual field defects and even to loss of eyesight due to the compulsion and contraction of the papillae of the optic nerve. Some embodiments disclosed hererin are concerned with exploring muscarinic agonists to treat eye diseases. Examples of eye diseaseas are increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, ocular hypertension, dry eye, blepharitis and meibomian gland disease, restore corneal sensitivity that has been impaired due to surgery on the cornea or other surface of the eye, allergic conjunctivitis and atopic and vernal keratoconjunctivitis, ptyregia, ocular symptoms of graft versus host disease, ocular allergy, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, uveitis, anterior uveitis, Behcet’s disease, Sjogren’s syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, chronic ocular surface inflammation caused by viral infection, herpes simplex keratitis, ocular rosacea, and pinguecula. In addition, the compounds disclosed herein may be used prevent corneal transplant rejection. As stated above glaucoma generally refers to damage in the optic nerve. There are theories indicating that increased intraocular pressure (IOP) is a factor to consider in connection with damage of the optic nerve. [0118] Accordingly, compounds disclosed herein have been found to reduce intraocular pressure. Compounds disclosed herein have also been found to have improved efficacy in vitro and in vivo, for example as tested by topical administration. The effect of some of the compounds disclosed herein can be seen in Figure 1 where compounds disclosed herein have been compared to a compound as previously described as AC00263201 (Comparative compound 2). The compounds were topically administered to an ocular hypertensive monkey eye. [0119] Additionally compounds disclosed herein have been found to have good pharmacokinetic properties in particular in connection with eye diseases such as glaucoma and other ophthalmic conditions. Examples of pharmacokinetic (ΡΚ) properties are good corneal exposure, iris ciliary body exposure and retinal exposure for at least 24h whereas the systemic exposure is low as can be seen in Figure 3. The improved pharmacokinetics for example means that the half life of the compound in iris ciliary body may be improved. [0120] The compounds disclosed herein have been found to increase tear secretion upon comparison with known pharmaceuticals used to treat eye diseases. An example of such pharmaceuticals is Pilocarpine. Pilocarpine is a non-selective muscarinic agonist and has in particular been used to treat dry eye and dry mouth symptoms by increasing tear and saliva secrection. Figure 2 illustrates the results obtained from the increased tear secreation study between compounds disclosed herein, AC00263201 and Pilocarpine. Surprisingly compounds disclosed herein (i.e. Ml selective muscarinic agonists) have an action similar to Pilocarpine. [0121] Some embodiments also pertain to the field of predictive medicine in which pharmacogenomics is used for prognostic (predictive) purposes. Pharmacogenomics deals with clinically significant hereditary variations in the response to drugs due to altered drug disposition and abnormal action in affected persons (see e.g., Eichelbaum, Clin Exp Pharmacol. Physiol., 23:983-985 (1996) and Linder, Clin. Chem. 43:254-66 (1997)). In general, two types of pharmacogenetic conditions can be differentiated: genetic conditions transmitted as a single factor altering the way drugs act on the body (altered drug action) or genetic conditions transmitted as single factors altering the way the body acts on drugs (altered drug metabolism). These pharmacogenetic conditions can occur as naturally-occurring polymorphisms. [0122] One pharmacogenomics approach to identifying genes that predict drug response, known as "a genome-wide association", relies primarily on a high-resolution map of the human genome consisting of known gene-related markers (e.g., a "bi-allelic" gene marker map that consists of 60,000-100,000 polymorphic or variable sites on the human genome, each of which has two variants). Such a high-resolution genetic map can be compared to a map of the genome of each of a statistically significant number of patients taking part in a Phase II/III drug trial to identify markers associated with a particular observed drug response or side effect. Alternatively, such a high resolution map can be generated from a combination of some tenmillion known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human genome. As used herein, a "SNP" is a common alteration that occurs in a single nucleotide base in a stretch of DNA. For example, a SNP may occur once per every 1,000 bases of DNA. A SNP may be involved in a disease process although the vast majority may not be disease-associated. Given a genetic map based on the occurrence of such SNPs, individuals can be grouped into genetic categories depending on a particular pattern of SNPs in their individual genome. In such a manner, treatment regimens can be tailored to groups of genetically similar individuals, taking into account traits that may be common among such genetically similar individuals. [0123] Alternatively, a method termed the "candidate gene approach" can be utilized to identify genes that predict drug response. According to this method, if a gene that encodes a drug's target is known (e.g., a protein or a receptor), all common variants of that gene can be identified in the population. It can be readily determined by standard techniques a particular version of the gene is associated with a particular drug response. [0124] Alternatively, a method termed "gene expression profiling" can be utilized to identify genes that predict drug response. For example, the gene expression of an animal dosed with a drug (e.g., a compound or composition disclosed herein) can give an indication whether gene pathways related to toxicity have been turned on. [0125] Information generated from more than one of the above pharmacogenomics approaches can be used to determine appropriate dosage and treatment regimens for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment of an individual. This knowledge, when applied to dosing or drug selection, can avoid adverse reactions or therapeutic failure and thus enhance therapeutic or prophylactic efficiency when treating a subject with a compound or composition disclosed herein, such as a modulator identified by one of the exemplary screening assays described herein. These approaches can also be used to identify novel candidate receptor or other genes suitable for further pharmacological characterization in vitro and in vivo. [0126] Accordingly, other embodiments include methods for identifying a genetic polymorphism predisposing a subject to being responsive to a compound described herein. The method comprises administering to a subject an effective amount of a compound; identifying a responsive subject having an ameliorated disease or condition associated with a cholinergic receptor; and identifying a genetic polymorphism in the responsive subject, wherein the genetic polymorphism predisposes a subject to being responsive to the compound. Identifying a genetic polymorphism in the responsive subject can be performed by any means known in the art including the methods discussed above. In addition, a kit to be used for identifying a genetic polymorphism predisposing a subject to being responsive to a compound disclosed herein comprises the compound disclosed herein, and preferably reagents and instructions for performing a genetic polymorphism test. [0127] In one embodiment, a subject can be tested for a known polymorphism that predisposes the subject to being responsive to the compound disclosed herein. The presence of the polymorphism indicates that the subject is suitable for treatment. [0128] The pharmacological properties and the selectivity of the compounds disclosed herein for specific muscarinic receptor subtypes may be demonstrated by a number of different assay methods using, for example, recombinant receptor subtypes, preferably of the human receptors as available, e.g., conventional second messenger or binding assays. A particularly convenient functional assay system is the receptor selection and amplification assay disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,707,798, which describes a method of screening for bioactive compounds by utilizing the ability of cells transfected with receptor DNA, e.g., coding for the different muscarinic subtypes, to amplify in the presence of a ligand of the receptor. Cell amplification is detected as increased levels of a marker also expressed by the cells. [0129] One embodiment includes a method of increasing an activity of a cholinergic receptor comprising contacting the cholinergic receptor or a system containing the cholinergic receptor with an effective amount of at least one compound of Formula I, as defined supra. [0130] Disorders suitable for treatment by compound disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, cognitive dysfunctions such as cognitive impairment, forgetfulness, confusion, memory loss, depression, attentional deficits, deficits in visual perception, and cognitive dysfunctions associated with mental disorders such as neuropsychiatric disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, dementia, age-related cognitive decline, and Down’s syndrome; neuropsychiatric disorders such as sleep disorders, depression, psychosis, hallucinations, aggressiveness, paranoia, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorders, and Gilles de la Tourette’s syndrome; eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia; anxiety disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorders, panic disorders, phobic disorders, general anxiety disorders, and posttraumatic stress disorders; mood disorders, such as clinical depression, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder; neurodegenerative disorders and conditions such as alcoholism, Alzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Huntington’s disease, HIV-associated dementia, Lewy body dementia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, Pick’s disease, and progressive supranuclear palsy; and other diseases and disorders such as pain, such as neuropathic pain; increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, ocular hypertension, dry eye, blepharitis and meibomian gland disease, restore corneal sensitivity that has been impaired due to surgery on the cornea or other surface of the eye, allergic conjunctivitis and atopic and vernal keratoconjunctivitis, ptyregia, ocular symptoms of graft versus host disease, ocular allergy, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, uveitis, anterior uveitis, Behcet’s disease, Sjogren’s syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, ocular cicatricial pemphigoid, chronic ocular surface inflammation caused by viral infection, herpes simplex keratitis, ocular rosacea, and pinguecula. In addition, the compounds disclosed herein may be used prevent corneal transplant rejection. Additionally the compounds disclosed herein may have neuroprotective effects and be used to treat age related macular degeneration, wet macular degeneration, dry macular degeneration, geographic atrophy, diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, tumors, retinal vein occlusion, optic neuropathy, ocular ischemic neuropathy, optic neuritis, retinitis pigmentosa and neuritis secondary to multiple sclerosis. [0131] The Tic disorders also include a spectrum of disorders including Tourettes and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). [0132] The affective disorder spectrum, including unipolar, bipolar are also anticipated to be suitable for treatment using compounds of Formula I. [0133] Neuropathic pain results from damage to or dysfunction of the peripheral or central nervous system, rather than stimulation of pain receptors. Pharmaceutical Compositions [0134] In another aspect, the present disclosure relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a physiologically acceptable surface active agents, carriers, diluents, excipients, smoothing agents, suspension agents, film forming substances, and coating assistants, or a combination thereof; and a compound disclosed herein. Acceptable carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA (1990), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Preservatives, stabilizers, dyes, sweeteners, fragrances, flavoring agents, and the like may be provided in the pharmaceutical composition. For example, sodium benzoate, ascorbic acid and esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid may be added as preservatives. In addition, antioxidants and suspending agents may be used. In various embodiments, alcohols, esters, sulfated aliphatic alcohols, and the like may be used as surface active agents; sucrose, glucose, lactose, starch, crystallized cellulose, mannitol, light anhydrous silicate, magnesium aluminate, magnesium methasilicate aluminate, synthetic aluminum silicate, calcium carbonate, sodium acid carbonate, calcium hydrogen phosphate, calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, and the like may be used as excipients; magnesium stearate, talc, hardened oil and the like may be used as smoothing agents; coconut oil, olive oil, sesame oil, peanut oil, soya may be used as suspension agents or lubricants; cellulose acetate phthalate as a derivative of a carbohydrate such as cellulose or sugar, or methylacetate-methacrylate copolymer as a derivative of polyvinyl may be used as suspension agents; and plasticizers such as ester phthalates and the like may be used as suspension agents. [0135] The term “pharmaceutical composition” refers to a mixture of a compound disclosed herein with other chemical components, such as diluents or carriers. The pharmaceutical composition facilitates administration of the compound to an organism. Multiple techniques of administering a compound exist in the art including, but not limited to, oral, injection, aerosol, parenteral, and topical administration. Pharmaceutical compositions can also be obtained by reacting compounds with inorganic or organic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. [0136] The term “carrier” defines a chemical compound that facilitates the incorporation of a compound into cells or tissues. For example dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a commonly utilized carrier as it facilitates the uptake of many organic compounds into the cells or tissues of an organism. [0137] The term “diluent” defines chemical compounds diluted in water that will dissolve the compound of interest as well as stabilize the biologically active form of the compound. Salts dissolved in buffered solutions are utilized as diluents in the art. One commonly used buffered solution is phosphate buffered saline because it mimics the salt conditions of human blood. Since buffer salts can control the pH of a solution at low concentrations, a buffered diluent rarely modifies the biological activity of a compound. [0138] The term “physiologically acceptable” defines a carrier or diluent that does not abrogate the biological activity and properties of the compound. [0139] The pharmaceutical compositions described herein can be administered to a human patient per se, or in pharmaceutical compositions where they are mixed with other active ingredients, as in combination therapy, or suitable carriers or excipient(s). Techniques for formulation and administration of the compounds of the instant application may be found in “Remington’s Pharmaceutical Sciences,” Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 18th edition, 1990. [0140] Suitable routes of administration may, for example, include oral, rectal, transmucosal, topical, or intestinal administration; parenteral delivery, including intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramedullary injections, as well as intrathecal, direct intraventricular, intraperitoneal, intranasal, or intraocular injections. The compounds can also be administered in sustained or controlled release dosage forms, including depot injections, osmotic pumps, pills, transdermal (including electrotransport) patches, and the like, for prolonged and/or timed, pulsed administration at a predetermined rate. [0141] The pharmaceutical compositions may be manufactured in a manner that is itself known, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or tabletting processes. [0142] Pharmaceutical compositions for use as described herein may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. Any of the well-known techniques, carriers, and excipients may be used as suitable and as understood in the art; e.g., in Remington’s Pharmaceutical Sciences, above. [0143] Injectables can be prepared in conventional forms, either as liquid solutions or suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to injection, or as emulsions. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, mannitol, lactose, lecithin, albumin, sodium glutamate, cysteine hydrochloride, and the like. In addition, if desired, the injectable pharmaceutical compositions may contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting agents, pH buffering agents, and the like. Physiologically compatible buffers include, but are not limited to, Hanks’s solution, Ringer’s solution, or physiological saline buffer. If desired, absorption enhancing preparations (for example, liposomes), may be utilized. [0144] For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated may be used in the formulation. [0145] Pharmaceutical formulations for parenteral administration, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion, include aqueous solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or other organic oils such as soybean, grapefruit or almond oils, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents that increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use. [0146] For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated readily by combining the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds disclosed herein to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by combining the active compounds with solid excipient, optionally grinding a resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol; cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch, potato starch, gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as the cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a salt thereof such as sodium alginate. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses. [0147] Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. [0148] For buccal administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner. [0149] For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use as described herein are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g., dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, e.g., gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. [0150] Further disclosed herein are various pharmaceutical compositions well known in the pharmaceutical art for uses that include intraocular, intranasal, and intraauricular delivery. Suitable penetrants for these uses are generally known in the art. Topical ophthalmic compositions may be formulated as a solution in water buffered at a pH of 5.0 to 8.0. Other ingredients that may be desirable to use in the ophthalmic preparations include preservatives (such as benzalkonium chloride, stabilized oxychloro complex, which is sold as Purite™, or stabilized chlorine dioxide), cosolvents (such as polysorbate 20, 60 and 80, Pluronic® F-68, F-84 and P-103, cyclodextrin, or Solutol) and viscosity-building agents (such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, or hydroxypropyl cellulose). The compounds disclosed herein may also be used in an intraocular implant as described in U.S. Patent 7,931,909 which is hereby incorporated by reference. Pharmaceutical compositions for intraocular delivery include aqueous ophthalmic solutions of the active compounds in water-soluble form, such as eyedrops, or in gellan gum (Shedden et al., Clin. Ther., 23(3):440-50 (2001)) or hydrogels (Mayer et al., Ophthalmologica, 210(2): 101-3 (1996)); ophthalmic ointments; ophthalmic suspensions, such as microparticulates, drug-containing small polymeric particles that are suspended in a liquid carrier medium (Joshi, A., J. Ocul. Pharmacol., 10(1):29-45 (1994)), lipid-soluble formulations (Aim et al., Prog. Clin. Biol. Res., 312:447-58 (1989)), and microspheres (Mordenti, Toxicol. Sci., 52(1): 101-6 (1999)); and ocular inserts. All of the above-mentioned references, are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Such suitable pharmaceutical formulations are most often and preferably formulated to be sterile, isotonic and buffered for stability and comfort. Pharmaceutical compositions for intranasal delviery may also include drops and sprays often prepared to simulate in many respects nasal secretions to ensure maintenance of normal ciliary action. As disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA (1990), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, and well-known to those skilled in the art, suitable formulations are most often and preferably isotonic, slightly buffered to maintain a pH of 5.5 to 6.5, and most often and preferably include antimicrobial preservatives and appropriate drug stabilizers. Pharmaceutical formulations for intraauricular delivery include suspensions and ointments for topical application in the ear. Common solvents for such aural formulations include glycerin and water. [0151] The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides. [0152] In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt. [0153] For hydrophobic compounds, a suitable pharmaceutical carrier may be a cosolvent system comprising benzyl alcohol, a nonpolar surfactant, a water-miscible organic polymer, and an aqueous phase. A common cosolvent system used is the VPD co-solvent system, which is a solution of 3% w/v benzyl alcohol, 8% w/v of the nonpolar surfactant Polysorbate 80™, and 65% w/v polyethylene glycol 300, made up to volume in absolute ethanol. Naturally, the proportions of a co-solvent system may be varied considerably without destroying its solubility and toxicity characteristics. Furthermore, the identity of the co-solvent components may be varied: for example, other low-toxicity nonpolar surfactants may be used instead of POLYSORBATE 80™; the fraction size of polyethylene glycol may be varied; other biocompatible polymers may replace polyethylene glycol, e.g., polyvinyl pyrrolidone; and other sugars or polysaccharides may substitute for dextrose. [0154] Alternatively, other delivery systems for hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds may be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are well known examples of delivery vehicles or carriers for hydrophobic drugs. Certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide also may be employed, although usually at the cost of greater toxicity. Additionally, the compounds may be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the therapeutic agent. Various sustained-release materials have been established and are well known by those skilled in the art. Sustained-release capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the compounds for a few weeks up to over 100 days. Depending on the chemical nature and the biological stability of the therapeutic reagent, additional strategies for protein stabilization may be employed. [0155] Agents intended to be administered intracellularly may be administered using techniques well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. For example, such agents may be encapsulated into liposomes. All molecules present in an aqueous solution at the time of liposome formation are incorporated into the aqueous interior. The liposomal contents are both protected from the external micro-environment and, because liposomes fuse with cell membranes, are efficiently delivered into the cell cytoplasm. The liposome may be coated with a tissue-specific antibody. The liposomes will be targeted to and taken up selectively by the desired organ. Alternatively, small hydrophobic organic molecules may be directly administered intracellularly. [0156] Additional therapeutic or diagnostic agents may be incorporated into the pharmaceutical compositions. Alternatively or additionally, pharmaceutical compositions may be combined with other compositions that contain other therapeutic or diagnostic agents. Methods of Administration [0157] The compounds or pharmaceutical compositions may be administered to the patient by any suitable means. Non-limiting examples of methods of administration include, among others, (a) administration though oral pathways, which administration includes administration in capsule, tablet, granule, spray, syrup, or other such forms; (b) administration through non-oral pathways such as rectal, vaginal, intraurethral, intraocular, intranasal, or intraauricular, which administration includes administration as an aqueous suspension, an oily preparation or the like or as a drip, spray, suppository, salve, ointment or the like; (c) administration via injection, subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, intravenously, intramuscularly, intradermally, intraorbitally, intracapsularly, intraspinally, intrastemally, or the like, including infusion pump delivery; (d) administration locally such as by injection directly in the renal or cardiac area, e.g., by depot implantation; as well as (℮) administration topically; as deemed appropriate by those of skill in the art for bringing the compound disclosed herein into contact with living tissue. [0158] Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for administration include compositions where the active ingredients are contained in an amount effective to achieve its intended purpose. The therapeutically effective amount of the compounds disclosed herein required as a dose will depend on the route of administration, the type of animal, including human, being treated, and the physical characteristics of the specific animal under consideration. The dose can be tailored to achieve a desired effect, but will depend on such factors as weight, diet, concurrent medication and other factors which those skilled in the medical arts will recognize. More specifically, a therapeutically effective amount means an amount of compound effective to prevent, alleviate or ameliorate symptoms of disease or prolong the survival of the subject being treated. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein. [0159] As will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, the useful in vivo dosage to be administered and the particular mode of administration will vary depending upon the age, weight and mammalian species treated, the particular compounds employed, and the specific use for which these compounds are employed. The determination of effective dosage levels, that is the dosage levels necessary to achieve the desired result, can be accomplished by one skilled in the art using routine pharmacological methods. Typically, human clinical applications of products are commenced at lower dosage levels, with dosage level being increased until the desired effect is achieved. Alternatively, acceptable in vitro studies can be used to establish useful doses and routes of administration of the compositions identified by the present methods using established pharmacological methods. [0160] In non-human animal studies, applications of potential products are commenced at higher dosage levels, with dosage being decreased until the desired effect is no longer achieved or adverse side effects disappear. The dosage may range broadly, depending upon the desired effects and the therapeutic indication. Typically, dosages may be between about 10 microgram/kg and 100 mg/kg body weight, preferably between about 100 microgram/kg and 10 mg/kg body weight. Alternatively dosages may be based and calculated upon the surface area of the patient, as understood by those of skill in the art. [0161] The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage for the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein can be chosen by the individual physician in view of the patient’s condition. (See e.g., Fingl et αℓ. 1975, in “The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics”, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, with particular reference to Ch. 1, ρ. 1). Typically, the dose range of the composition administered to the patient can be from about 0.5 to 1000 mg/kg of the patient’s body weight. The dosage may be a single one or a series of two or more given in the course of one or more days, as is needed by the patient. In instances where human dosages for compounds have been established for at least some condition, those same dosages may be used, or dosages that are between about 0.1% and 500%, more preferably between about 25% and 250% of the established human dosage. Where no human dosage is established, as will be the case for newly-discovered pharmaceutical compounds, a suitable human dosage can be inferred from ED50 or ID50 values, or other appropriate values derived from in vitro or in vivo studies, as qualified by toxicity studies and efficacy studies in animals. [0162] It should be noted that the attending physician would know how to and when to terminate, interrupt, or adjust administration due to toxicity or organ dysfunctions. Conversely, the attending physician would also know to adjust treatment to higher levels if the clinical response were not adequate (precluding toxicity). The magnitude of an administrated dose in the management of the disorder of interest will vary with the severity of the condition to be treated and to the route of administration. The severity of the condition may, for example, be evaluated, in part, by standard prognostic evaluation methods. Further, the dose and perhaps dose frequency, will also vary according to the age, body weight, and response of the individual patient. A program comparable to that discussed above may be used in veterinary medicine. [0163] Although the exact dosage will be determined on a drug-by-drug basis, in most cases, some generalizations regarding the dosage can be made. The daily dosage regimen for an adult human patient may be, for example, an oral dose of between 0.1 mg and 2000 mg of each active ingredient, preferably between 1 mg and 500 mg, e.g. 5 to 200 mg. An ocular eye drop may range in concentration between 0.005 and 5 percent. In one embodiment, an eye drop may range between 0.01 and 1 percent, or between 0.01 and 0.3 percent in another embodiment. In other embodiments, an intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular dose of each active ingredient of between 0.01 mg and 100 mg, preferably between 0.1 mg and 60 mg, e.g. 1 to 40 mg is used. In cases of administration of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, dosages may be calculated as the free base. In some embodiments, the composition is administered 1 to 4 times per day. Alternatively the compositions disclosed herein may be administered by continuous intravenous infusion, preferably at a dose of each active ingredient up to 1000 mg per day. As will be understood by those of skill in the art, in certain situations it may be necessary to administer the compounds disclosed herein in amounts that exceed, or even far exceed, the above-stated, preferred dosage range or frequency in order to effectively and aggressively treat particularly aggressive diseases or infections. In some embodiments, the compounds will be administered for a period of continuous therapy, for example for a week or more, or for months or years. [0164] Dosage amount and interval may be adjusted individually to provide plasma or tissue levels of the active moiety which are sufficient to maintain the modulating effects, or minimal effective concentration (MEC). The MEC will vary for each compound but can be estimated from in vitro data. Dosages necessary to achieve the MEC will depend on individual characteristics and route of administration. However, HPLC assays or bioassays can be used to determine plasma concentrations. [0165] Dosage intervals can also be determined using MEC value. Compositions should be administered using a regimen which maintains plasma levels above the MEC for 10-90% of the time, preferably between 30-90% and most preferably between 50-90%. [0166] In cases of local administration or selective uptake, the effective local concentration of the drug may not be related to plasma concentration. [0167] The amount of composition administered may be dependent on the subject being treated, on the subject’s weight, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration and the judgment of the prescribing physician. [0168] Compounds disclosed herein can be evaluated for efficacy and toxicity using known methods. For example, the toxicology of a particular compound, or of a subset of the compounds, sharing certain chemical moieties, may be established by determining in vitro toxicity towards a cell line, such as a mammalian, and preferably human, cell line. The results of such studies are often predictive of toxicity in animals, such as mammals, or more specifically, humans. Alternatively, the toxicity of particular compounds in an animal model, such as mice, rats, rabbits, or monkeys, may be determined using known methods. The efficacy of a particular compound may be established using several recognized methods, such as in vitro methods, animal models, or human clinical trials. Recognized in vitro models exist for nearly every class of condition, including but not limited to cancer, cardiovascular disease, and various immune dysfunction. Similarly, acceptable animal models may be used to establish efficacy of chemicals to treat such conditions. When selecting a model to determine efficacy, the skilled artisan can be guided by the state of the art to choose an appropriate model, dose, and route of administration, and regime. Of course, human clinical trials can also be used to determine the efficacy of a compound in humans. [0169] The compositions may, if desired, be presented in a pack or dispenser device which may contain one or more unit dosage forms containing the active ingredient. The pack may for example comprise metal or plastic foil, such as a blister pack. The pack or dispenser device may be accompanied by instructions for administration. The pack or dispenser may also be accompanied with a notice associated with the container in form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use, or sale of pharmaceuticals, which notice is reflective of approval by the agency of the form of the drug for human or veterinary administration. Such notice, for example, may be the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for prescription drugs, or the approved product insert. Compositions comprising a compound disclosed herein formulated in a compatible pharmaceutical carrier may also be prepared, placed in an appropriate container, and labeled for treatment of an indicated condition.

The tear distance, in mm, is recorded. The mice were not anesthetized or otherwise sedated. Tear secretion is measured at baseline, after which a 5μ1 drop of 0.1% 302s, 303s, or 305 or vehicle or 20 μ1 standard drop of 0.2% Pilocarpine is applied to each eye, and tear secretion is measured again 1, 3, 6, and/or 24 hours post-dosing. Data are analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni comparisons to vehicle. All data are shown in Figure 2 and Table 2. In the longest time-course study (the pilocarpine 24-hour study), the compound (302s) and pilocarpine showed statistically significant improved tear secretion at 3 and 6 hours post-dosing, and compound 302s showed a trend toward significance at 24 hours, compared to vehicle, but the effect on tear secretion with Comparative Compound 2 was not significantly different from vehicle. The enhancement of tear secretion by the compound exceeded the effect of pilocarpine at all time points. Further details can be seen in Figure 2. In other studies using the same method (see Table 2), additional compounds disclosed herein (303s and 305) were shown to have effects on tear secretion greater than that of Comparative Compound 2 that were statistically significant compared to vehicle.

Methods for Pharmacokinetic Evaluation [0272] The experimental animals were normotensive male New Zealand White rabbits. A single drop (35μ1) of a compound, (302s), at a concentration of 0.126% (corrected for oxalate salt weight) was administered to each eye by pipette. At 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hours, plasma, aqueous humor, vitreous humor, cornea, iris-ciliary body, retina, and choroid were collected (2 rabbits/timepoint, or 4 eyes/timepoint). Approximately 0.5ml of blood was collected and placed in EDTA tubes. Blood samples were kept on ice during the duration of sample collection, and centrifuged to harvest plasma. Animals were euthanized and ocular tissues were collected and placed in vials and kept on dry ice for the duration of the collections. All ocular tissue and plasma samples were stored at or below -60°C until bioanalysis. In all tissues, the Tmax for the compound was 0.25hr. Maximal plasma concentration(Cmax) for the compound was 6.4ng/g. The plasma concentration at most timepoints was > 100-fold lower than the compound concentration in target ocular tissues (iris/ciliary body, cornea, retina). The concentration of compound 302s in the target ocular tissues remained at active levels up to at least 24 h. The analysis of all tissues is reported in Figure 3.
