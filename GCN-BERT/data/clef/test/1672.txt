BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION (1) Field of the Invention The present invention relates to peptide analogs of oxyntomodulin (OXM, glucagon-37), which have been modified to be resistant to cleavage and inactivation by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and to increase in vivo half-life of the peptide analog while enabling the peptide analog to act as a dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor (GCGR) agonist, and the use of such peptide analogs for treatment of metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity. (2) Description of Related Art The hormone oxyntomodulin (OXM, glucagon-37) is a posttranslational product of preproglucagon processing in the intestine and central nervous system (CNS) and is secreted from L-cells in the gut in response to food intake. Discovered in 1983, OXM has been implicated in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure (Jarrouse et al., Endocrinol. 115: 102-105 (1984); Schjoldager et al., Eur. J. Clin. Invest., 18: 499-503 (1988)). Central or peripheral administration of OXM in rats causes a decrease in short term food intake with minimal effects on gastric emptying (Dakin et al. Endocrinology, 142: 4244-4250 (2001), Dakin et al. Endocrinology, 145: 2687-2695 (2004)). Repeated intracerebroventricular administration of OXM in rats results in elevated core temperatures and reduced weight gain compared to pair-fed animals, suggesting effects on both caloric intake and energy expenditure (Dakin et al. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab., 283: E1173-E1177 (2002)). In related studies, peripheral administration of OXM dose-dependently inhibited both fast-induced and dark phase food intake, but unlike GLP-1, had no effect on gastric emptying. OXM also reduced levels of fasting ghrelin and increased c-fos immunoreactivity, in the arcuate nucleus (ARC). Repeated seven-day IP administration of OXM caused a reduction in the rate of body weight gain and adiposity in rats (See Dakin et al. Endocrinology, 145: 2687-2695 (2004)). Studies of OXM action in mice have demonstrated that although OXM can activate both the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors, the anorectic actions of OXM require only the GLP-1 receptor, as icy OXM inhibits food intake in glucagon receptor knockout mice. However, the anorectic effects of OXM are completely absent in GLP-1 receptor knockout mice. Furthermore, exendin-4, but not OXM, regulates energy expenditure in mice. Hence, OXM appears to be a weak agonist at the GLP-1 receptor, when used in pharmacological concentrations (See Baggio et al., Gastroenterol. 127: 546-58 (2004)). OXM was also found to ameliorate glucose intolerance in mice fed a high fat diet (Dakin et al., Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 294: E142-E147 (2008) and increase the intrinsic heart rate in mice independent of the GLP-1 receptor (Sowden et al., Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 292: R962-R970 (2007). OXM has also been shown to differentially affect GLP-1 receptor beta-arrestin recruitment and signaling through Galpha (Jorgensen et al., J. Pharma. Exp. Therapeut. 322: 148-154 (2007)) and to differentially affect hypothalamic neuronal activation following peripheral injection of OXM (Choudhri et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 350: 298-306 (2006)). In humans, a single 90 minute intravenous infusion of OXM in normal weight healthy subjects reduced hunger scores and food intake at a buffet meal by about 19%. Cumulative twelve-hour caloric intake was reduced by about 11% with no reports of nausea or changes in food palatability (Cohen et al., J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 88: 4696-4701 (2003); Lykkegaard et al., ADA Scientific Sessions, Abstract #1506-P (2003)). More recently, pre-prandial injections of OXM over a four-week period in obese healthy volunteers (BMI about 33) led to a significant reduction of caloric intake on the first day of treatment (about 25%) that was maintained over the course of the study (35% reduction after four weeks) (Wynne et al., Diabetes 54: 2390-2395 (2005)). Robust weight loss was observed at the end of the study in treated subjects (1.9%, placebo-corrected). Plasma levels of OXM were similar to that observed in the infusion study (peak concentration about 950 pM). The absence of any tachyphylaxis and a low incidence of mild and transient nausea (about 3%) despite the relatively high doses necessitated by the poor in vivo stability of OXM (plasma t1/2<12 minutes) renders this hormone one of the few obesity targets with both human validation and an attractive tolerability profile. OXM has a very short half-life and is rapidly inactivated by the cell surface dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) (Zhu et al., J. Biol. Chem. 278: 22418-22423 (2002). However, DPP-IV inhibitors are weight-neutral in the clinic, suggesting that supraphysiological levels of OXM (900-1000 pM) may be required to achieve weight loss in humans. OXM peptide analogs for inducing weight loss in humans has been the object of Published International Application Nos. WO03/022304, WO2004/062685, and WO2006/134340. OXM therefore shows potential as a treatment for metabolic disorders such as diabetes and obesity. However, because of the poor in vivo stability of OXM, there exists a need to develop OXM analogs that can be safely and efficaciously administered for the treatment of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. It would be further desirable if analogs or derivatives were developed that were modified by conjugation to moieties that would improve stability and pharmacokinetics, more particularly modifications that confer resistance to DPP-IV cleavage. It would further be desirable to provide OXM analogs that are capable of acting as dual GLP-1 receptor/glucagon receptor agonists.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION OXM-based therapy has the potential to favorably impact both obesity and, the as yet to be carefully characterized, concomitant effects on improving diabetes. Weight loss efficacy and reduction in food intake upon peripheral administration of OXM has been well validated in humans (Wynne et al., Diabetes 54: 2390-2395 (2005)). More recently, OXM has been shown to increase metabolic rate and specifically activity-related energy expenditure in obese subjects (Wynne et al., Int. J. Obes. 30: 1729-1736 (2006), advance online publication, Apr. 18, 2006; doi:10.1038/sj.ijo.0803344). OXM has also been shown to reduce body weight in humans (See, for example, Published International Application Nos. WO03/022304, WO2004/062685, and WO2006/134340); however, the effects of the OXM peptide and similar dual GLP-1 receptor/glucagon receptor (GLP-1R/GCGR) agonists on the glycemic control independent of weight loss have not been systematically studied. The ability of OXM to have agonist activity at both the glucagon receptor and the GLP-1 receptor makes it an attractive candidate for treating metabolic diseases where it is desirable that the treatment positively interact with the glucagon and GLP-1 receptors. OXM (and GLP-1) has a very short half-life and is rapidly inactivated by the cell surface dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). Mutations can be incorporated into the OXM peptide to render the peptide resistant to DPP-IV cleavage; however, many of these mutations have also been found to inactivate the native peptide or adversely affect the ability of the peptide to interact with the glucagon receptor (GCGR) or GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) (See Published International Application No. WO2007/100535, which is incorporated herein in its entirety). OXM (and GLP-1) is also rapidly cleared by the kidneys. Conjugation of peptides with bulky substituents such as polyethylene glycol can reduce renal clearance of the peptide; however, when these bulky substituents have been incorporated into the OXM peptide, many of resulting OXM peptide analogs have been found to have a reduced ability or no ability to effectively interact with the glucagon receptor. Before effective therapies for metabolic diseases based on administering OXM peptides can be advanced, the problems associated with stability and pharmacokinetics need to be solved. The OXM peptide analogs disclosed herein solve these problems. First, the limited in vivo stability of native OXM and GLP-1 due to cleavage by DPP-IV and rapid renal clearance, which necessitates frequent dosing (t.i.d. s.c. injections for OXM, continuous infusion for GLP-1) at high doses in humans has been solved by mutating the site of DPP-IV cleavage (the penultimate residue at the N-terminus) and lipidating the OXM peptide to increase in vivo half-life (t1/2). It is anticipated that the t1/2 of the lipidated (such as acylated or conjugated with a cholesterol moiety) OXM peptide analogs in humans will be suitable for at least once daily administration. The OXM peptide analogs disclosed herein are more convenient for therapeutic purposes than native OXM, which requires t.i.d. dosing. Second, the tolerability profile of polypeptides of the current invention is anticipated to be similar to that of native OXM in humans, which may be superior to that of conventional GLP-1 mimetics like exenatide and liraglutide. The chronic efficacy of the OXM analogs disclosed herein may therefore be better than conventional GLP-1 mimetics, such as Byetta® (Amylin Pharmaceuticals), due to minimal nausea and vomiting, which have typically been dose limiting for the GLP-1 mimetics. Unlike the latter, no dose-titrations to mitigate nausea may be required for polypeptides of this invention. Third, no systematic studies have been performed to evaluate the potential for improving glucose control. Since OXM is potent agonist of the glucagon receptor, the expectation would be that chronic administration would lead to impaired glucose control (hyperglycemia). However, unexpectedly, the OXM analogs disclosed herein, which incorporate a balanced GLP-1 receptor and GCGR co-agonism, gives enhanced reductions in food intake and body weight with chronic administration and results in improved glucose tolerance. OXM peptide analogs that have dual GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and glucagon receptor (GCGR) agonist activity are indicated herein as (+/+). OXM peptide analogs that are GLP-1 agonists only are indicated herein as (+/0). To produce a long acting OXM peptide analogs has not been straight forward. Our initial studies focused on site-specific conjugation of a bulky poly-ethylene glycol (PEG) substituent at promising locations throughout the peptide. Surprisingly, addition of PEG at all positions tested resulted in a significant reduction in GCGR and/or GLP-1R potency. We therefore investigated other methods to improve pharmaco kinetic properties, whilst maintaining GCGR activity. Addition of a cholesterol conjugate to various positions in the peptide indicated C-terminal conjugation as the most favorable method. In vitro and in vivo studies, however, indicated that the cholesteroylation resulted in a significant serum shift of potency and decreased in vivo efficacy. Therefore, further investigation resulted in the non-trivial inclusion of a hydrophilic linker between the peptide and cholesterol group, or direct addition of an acyl-chain to a C-terminal residue. Primary indications in which the OXM analogs disclosed herein can be used for is the treatment of obesity and/or diabetes. Secondary indications are metabolic syndrome, hyperglycemia, impaired fasting glucose, and other prediabetic states. Further indications include all indications for GLP-1 such as irritable bowel syndrome and other absorptive diseases of the gut, ischemia, stroke, and neurological disorders including anxiety, impaired cognition, and Alzheimer's disease. Based on published human studies with OXM, the OXM analogs disclosed herein are anticipated to exhibit at least comparable if not superior efficacy and a better safety profile than current anti-obesity agents such as orlistat (Xenical® (Roche), a lipase inhibitor) and sibutramine (Meridia® (Abbott Laboratories), a seratonin/norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitor), for which GI intolerance (diarrhea, flatulence) and hypertension are common side effects, respectively. In particular aspects, the OXM peptide analogs optionally includes a protecting group covalently joined to the N-terminal amino group. A protecting group covalently joined to the N-terminal amino group of the peptide reduces the reactivity of the amino terminus under in vivo conditions. Amino protecting groups include —C1-10 alkyl, —C1-10 substituted alkyl, —C2-10 alkenyl, —C2-10 substituted alkenyl, aryl, —C1-6 alkyl aryl, —C(O)—(CH2)1-6—COOH, —C(O)—C1-6 alkyl, —C(O)-aryl, —C(O)—O—C1-6 alkyl, or —C(O)—O-aryl. In particular embodiments, the amino terminus protecting group is selected from the group consisting of acetyl, propyl, succinyl, benzyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, and t-butyloxycarbonyl. Deamination of the N-terminal amino acid is another modification that is contemplated for reducing the reactivity of the amino terminus under in vivo conditions. The OXM peptide analogs may be modified to have a protecting group covalently joined to the C-terminal carboxy group, which reduces the reactivity of the carboxy terminus under in vivo conditions. For example, carboxylic acid groups of the peptide, whether carboxyl-terminal or side chain, may be provided in the form of a salt of a pharmacologically-acceptable cation or esterified to form a C1-6 ester, or converted to an amide of formula NRR2 wherein R and R2 are each independently H or C1-6 alkyl, or combined to form a heterocyclic ring, such as a 5- or 6-membered ring. The carboxy terminus protecting group is preferably attached to the α-carbonyl group of the last amino acid. Carboxy terminus protecting groups include, but are not limited to, amide, methylamide, and ethylamide Amino groups of the peptide, whether N-terminal or side chain, may be in the form of a pharmacologically-acceptable acid addition salt, such as the HCl, HBr, acetic, benzoic, toluene sulfonic, maleic, tartaric, and other organic salts, or may be modified to C1-6 alkyl or dialkyl amino or further converted to an amide. The OXM peptide analogs that are capable of acting as dual GLP-1 and glucagon agonists comprise the amino acid sequence of a human oxyntomodulin (OXM) shown in SEQ ID NO:1 wherein the second amino acid from the N-terminus is substituted with an amino acid that renders the peptide resistant to cleavage and inactivation by dipeptidyl peptidase IV; a lipid or cholesterol moiety covalently linked to the OXM peptide analog; optionally one to three amino acid substitutions in addition to the substitution at position 2; and optionally has a protecting group that, if present, is joined to the C-terminal carboxy group of the peptide. In further embodiments, the peptide analogs further lack the amino acid sequence RNRNNIA (SEQ ID NO:104). In general, OXM peptide analogs having the above structure will act as a dual GLP-1 receptor and glucagon receptor agonist and have a serum half-life greater than the serum half-life of native human OXM.

L1-Z2 can be linked to the C-terminal amino acid of P or to an internal amino acid of P. In each of the above embodiments, the lipid or cholesterol moiety can be directly or indirectly linked to the side chain of an amino acid. When the lipid or cholesterol moiety is indirectly linked to the amino acid side-chain, the lipid or cholesterol moiety is linked to the amino acid side-chain by means of a linker moiety. In particular aspects, the lipid or cholesterol is directly linked to the side chain of an amino acid which is then linked to the OXM peptide analog by a linker moiety (L1). In particular embodiments of the OXM analogs disclosed herein, when residues 16 and 20 are Glu and Lys, respectively, the side chains of said residues can participate in a lactam bridge between said Glu and Lys residues. In many embodiments, the linker moiety is a hydrophilic linker. The chemical structure of the linker moiety is not critical, however, since it serves primarily as a spacer. However, in certain embodiments, the linker moiety may itself provide improved properties to the OXM peptide analogs. Examples of linker moieties, include but are not limited to, amino acids and peptides; alkyl linkers such as —NH—(CH2)s—C(O)—, wherein s=2-20, these alkyl linkers may further be substituted by any non-sterically hindering group such as lower alkyl (for example, C1-6) lower acyl, halogen (for example, Cl, Br), CN, NH2, phenyl, and the like; an ethoxy polymer that includes one to twelve ethoxy units; Ttds (1-amino-4,7,10-trioxa-13-tridecanamine-succinamic acid); and one, two, three, or more gamma glutamic acid residues. In general, the linker moiety is covalently linked to the C-terminal amino acid of the peptide (P) and Z2 is covalently linked to the linker moiety. In particular aspects, the linker moiety is covalently linked to an internal amino acid of P and Z2 is covalently linked to the linker moiety. In further aspects, when L1-Z2 are covalently linked to an internal amino acid of P, X9 can include one or more gamma glutamic acid residues. The OXM peptide analogs include diastereomers as well as their racemic and resolved enantiomerically pure forms. In general, the amino acids are in the L-form with particular amino acids in D-form. As is known in the art, individual amino acids can be represented as follows: A=Ala=Alanine; C=Cys=Cysteine; D=Asp=Aspartic Acid; E=Glu=Glutamic Acid; F=Phe=Phenylalanine; G=Gly=Glycine; H=His=Histidine; I=Ile=Isoleucine; K=Lys=Lysine; L=Leu=Leucine; M=Met=Methionine; N=Asn=Asparagine; P=Pro=Proline; Q=Gln=Glutamine; R=Arg=Arginine; S=Ser=Serine; T=Thr=Threonine; V=Val=Valine; W=Trp=Tryptophan; and Y=Tyr=Tyrosine. Table 1 shows the structures for a representative number of OXM peptide analogs based on the full-length OXM molecule that have activity at both the glucagon receptor and the GLP-1 receptor (+/+). OXM peptide analogs OXM29, 208, 209 and 229 are peptide analogs precursors (thiolated peptides) that were used for the conjugation reaction with the bromo-cholesterol moieties.

OXM peptide analogs OXM36 and OXM115 were prepared from OXM229, which includes the native human OXM peptide but with a D-serine at amino acid position 2 and a cysteine residue in peptide linkage at the C-terminus and in which the C-terminal carboxy group has been amidated. OXM36 has the structure HsQGTFTSDYSKYLDSRRAQDFVQWLMNTKRNRNNIAC4-CONH2 (SEQ ID NO:8) wherein C4 is a cysteine residue in which cholest-5-en-3-yl{[(2R)-3-amino-2-(amino)-3-oxopropyl]thio}acetate is covalently linked thereto as shown below. OXM115 has the structure HsQGTFTSDYSKYLDSRRAQDFVQWLMNTKRNRNNIAC7-CONH2 (SEQ ID NO:21) wherein the C7 is a cholest-5-en-3-yl 1-{[(2R)-3-amino-2-(amino)-3-oxopropyl]thio}-2-oxo-6,9,12,15-tetraoxa-3-azaoctadecan-18-oate (or Cys(Oxa4-cholesterol)) as shown below. C7 differs from C4 in that it has a hydrophilic spacer formed by four ethylene glycol repeats (ethoxy units) between the cholesterol group and the cysteine moiety. The C7 group increases solubility of the resulting peptide-cholesterol conjugate. Moreover, in the presence of serum plasma, the peptide-C7 conjugate shows a less prominent serum shift than peptide-C4 conjugates. This was found to be important for maintaining an optimal balanced activity on the two receptors GLP-1R and Glucagon receptor. The results shown in the Examples illustrate this aspect. OXM peptide analogs OXM70 and OXM216 were prepared from OXM29, which includes the native human OXM peptide but with α-aminoisobutyric acid at amino acid position 2 and with a cysteine residue in peptide linkage at the C-terminus and in which the C-terminal carboxy group has been amidated. OXM70 has the structure HαQGTFTSDYSKYLDSRRAQDFVQWLMNTKRNRNNIAC4-CONH2 (SEQ ID NO:12) wherein C4 is cholest-5-en-3-yl{[(2R)-3-amino-2-(amino)-3-oxopropyl]thio}acetate as shown for OXM36. OXM216 has the structure HαQGTFTSDYSKYLDSRRAQDFVQWLMNTKRNRNNIAC7-CONH2 (SEQ ID NO:29) wherein the C7 is a cholest-5-en-3-yl 1-{[(2R)-3-amino-2-(amino)-3-oxopropyl]thio}-2-oxo-6,9,12,15-tetraoxa-3-azaoctadecan-18-oate (or Cys(Oxa4-cholesterol)) as for OXM115. OXM peptide analog OXM212 was prepared from OXM208, which includes the native human OXM peptide but with α-aminoisobutyric acid at amino acid position 2, norleucine in place of the methionine residue at position 27, with a cysteine residue in peptide linkage at the C-terminus and in which the C-terminal carboxy group has been amidated. OXM212 has the structure HαQGTFTSDYSKYLDSRRAQDFVQWLnNTKRNRNNIAC4-CONH2 (SEQ ID NO:26) wherein C4 is cholest-5-en-3-yl{[(2R)-3-amino-2-(amino)-3-oxopropyl]thio}acetate as shown for OXM36. OXM peptide analog OXM213 was prepared from OXM209, which includes the native human OXM peptide but with α-aminoisobutyric acid at amino acid position 2, O-methyl-L-homoserine in place of the methionine residue at position 27, with a cysteine residue in peptide linkage at the C-terminus and in which the C-terminal carboxy group has been amidated. OXM213 has the structure HαQGTFTSDYSKYLDSRRAQDFVQWLYNTKRNRNNIAC4-CONH2 (SEQ ID NO:28) wherein C4 is cholest-5-en-3-yl{[(2R)-3-amino-2-(amino)-3-oxopropyl]thio}acetate as shown for OXM36. OXM237 has the structure HsQGTFTSDYSKYLDSRRAQDFVQWLmNTKRNRNNIAC7-CONH2 (SEQ ID NO:31). It was designed to contain D-Ser (s) at position 2, Met(O) at position 27, and a Cys(Oxa4-cholesterol) (C7) at position site 38. OXM238 was designed to contain D-Ser (s) at position 2, Met(O) at position 27, and a Cys(acetamide) (C5) at position site 38. This peptide has the same peptide sequence of OXM237 and is a control peptide with no cholesterol but with the cysteine thiol blocked with acetamide. OXM259-OXM268 and OXM306-308 (as shown in Table 1) have the amino acid sequence of OXM but wherein the amino acid at position 2 has been substituted with a non-natural amino acid to identify amino acid substitutions that confer resistance to DPP4 catalytic activity. OXM peptide analogs that lack the amino acid sequence RNRNNIA (SEQ ID NO:55) can also display full agonistic activity on the GLP-1 and the Glucagon receptors. These OXM peptide analogs along with some additional peptides based upon the full-sized OXM peptide are shown in Table 2. These truncated OXM peptide analogs are variants of the Glucagon K (GcgK) genus of peptides that were disclosed in commonly owned International Published Application No. WO2007100535. The GcgK peptides are peptides where the OXM sequence has been truncated at the C terminus to eliminate the seven amino acid residues at the C-terminus. The resulting peptide is that one of glucagon with an extra lysine residue at the C-terminus. This GcgK peptide is compatible with a +/+ pattern in which the peptides show subnanomolar potency on both the GLP-1R and the GCGR. In contrast, native OXM shows nanomolar potency on the two receptors. An additional advantage of the GcgK peptide is that the two basic arginine residues at the C-terminus have been eliminated. This was important in the construction of lipidated (acylated or cholesterylated) peptide analogs having dual GLP-1/GCGR agonist activity. Our data has shown that lipidated peptide analogs with a pI above 7 based on the OXM sequence stimulate mast cell degranulation while lipidated peptide analogs with a pI of about 5 appear not to stimulate mast degranulation (See Example 11). Thus based on our results, to reduce the risk of the peptide stimulating mast cell degranulation, the pI for lipidated based peptide analogs should be around 5. Therefore, in particular aspects the lipidated peptide analogs have a pI less than 6.0. In further aspects, the lipidated peptide analogs have a pI between 4.5 and 6.0. In a further aspect, the lipidated peptide analogs have a pI of about 5.4. Reduction of pI was done using one or more of the following three different strategies: 1) substitution of residues in the peptide, 2) introduction of a carboxylate group at the C terminus, and 3) introduction of negative residues such as one or more gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid residues as spacers. Therefore, in one aspect of OXM peptide analogs with a pI of less than 6.0, the acyl or cholesterol group is covalently linked to the peptide by means of a spacer that comprises two gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid residues. Examples of these peptide analogs include those peptide analogs shown in Table 2. For example, peptides with a pI of about 5.4 include but are not limited to OXM345, OXM380, OXM381, OXM392, OXM395, OXM398, OXM399, OXM400, and OXM401. In another aspect of peptide analogs with a pI of less than 6.0, the acyl or cholesterol group is covalently linked to an internal amino acid in the peptide analogs by means of a spacer that comprises one or two gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid residues and the peptide further includes one or more gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid residue covalently to the lysine residue at the C-terminus Examples of these peptide analogs include but are not limited to OXM407, OXM408, OXM414, and OXM418. In another aspect of peptide analogs with a pI of less than 6.0, the acyl or cholesterol group is covalently linked to the C-terminus of the peptide by means of a spacer that comprises one gamma-carboxy-glutamic acid residue and the peptide further includes one or more amino acid substitutions to reduce the pI of the peptide. OXM374 is an example of such a peptide analog. Therefore, further provided is a peptide analog comprising the amino acid sequence HSQGTFTSDYSKYLDSRRAQDFVQWLMNTK (SEQ ID NO:109) in which the second amino acid from the N-terminus of the peptide is substituted with an amino acid that renders the peptide resistant to cleavage and inactivation by dipeptidyl peptidase IV; the peptide includes a lipid or cholesterol moiety covalently linked to the peptide by a spacer comprising one or more gamma-glutamic acid residues; the peptide optionally includes one to three amino acid substitutions in addition to the substitution at position 2; and the peptide optionally includes a protecting group that, if present, is joined to the C-terminal carboxy group of the peptide; wherein the peptide analog has a pI of less than 6.0 and is a dual GLP-1 receptor agonist and glucagon receptor agonist, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. In particular aspects, peptide analogs have a pI between 4 and 6, or a pI of about 5.0, for example, a pI of about 5.4. In further aspects, the amino acid substituted for the second amino acid from the N-terminus of the peptide analog is selected from the group consisting of D-serine, α-aminoisobutyric acid, and 1-amino-1-cyclobutane carboxylic acid. In particular aspects, the peptide analog includes a cholesterol moiety covalently linked to the thiol group of a cysteine residue that is covalently linked to the ε-amino group of the lysine residue at the C-terminus of the peptide analog by a spacer comprising one or more gamma glutamic acid residues.

In a further embodiment, the lipid moiety is covalently linked to the ε-amino group of the lysine residue by one or more gamma-glutamic acid residues. In a further embodiment, the lipid moiety is covalently linked to the ε-amino group of the lysine residue at the C-terminus by one or more gamma-glutamic acid residues. In a further embodiment, the lipid moiety is covalently linked to the ε-amino group of the lysine residue by one or more gamma-glutamic acid residues and the lysine residue linked to the lysine residue at the C-terminus by one or more gamma-glutamic acid residues. In further aspects, the peptide analog further includes one or more amino acid substitutions at amino acid positions selected from the group consisting of positions 10, 12, 16, 17, 18, and 27. In particular embodiments, the peptide analog includes one or more amino acid substitutions selected from the group consisting of lysine for the tyrosine at position 10, serine for the lysine at position 12, glutamic acid or α-aminoisobutyric acid for the serine at position 16, glutamic acid for the arginine at position 17, alanine for the arginine at position 18, lysine for the glutamine at position 20, and norleucine or O-methyl-L-homoserine for the methionine at position 27.

Pharmaceutical Compositions Further provided are pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of one or more of the OXM analogs disclosed herein for the treatment of a metabolic disorder in an individual. Such disorders include, but are not limited to, obesity, metabolic syndrome or syndrome X, type II diabetes, complications of diabetes such as retinopathy, hypertension, dyslipidemias, cardiovascular disease, gallstones, osteoarthritis, and certain forms of cancers. The obesity-related disorders herein are associated with, caused by, or result from obesity. “Obesity” is a condition in which there is an excess of body fat. The operational definition of obesity is based on the Body Mass Index (BMI), calculated as body weight per height in meters squared (kg/m2). “Obesity” refers to a condition whereby an otherwise healthy subject has a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2, or a condition whereby a subject with at least one co-morbidity has a BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2. An “obese subject” is an otherwise healthy subject with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2 or a subject with at least one co-morbidity with a BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2. A “subject at risk for obesity” is an otherwise healthy subject with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 to less than 30 kg/m2 or a subject with at least one co-morbidity with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 to less than 27 kg/m2. The increased risks associated with obesity occur at a lower Body Mass Index (BMI) in Asians. In Asian countries, including Japan, “obesity” refers to a condition whereby a subject with at least one obesity-induced or obesity-related co-morbidity that requires weight reduction or that would be improved by weight reduction, has a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2. In Asian countries, including Japan, an “obese subject” refers to a subject with at least one obesity-induced or obesity-related co-morbidity that requires weight reduction or that would be improved by weight reduction, with a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2. In Asian countries, a “subject at risk of obesity” is a subject with a BMI of greater than 23 kg/m2 to less than 25 kg/m2. As used herein, the term “obesity” is meant to encompass all of the above definitions of obesity. Obesity-induced or obesity-related co-morbidities include, but are not limited to, diabetes, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus—type 2, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, insulin resistance syndrome, dyslipidemia, hypertension, hyperuricacidemia, gout, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, sleep apnea syndrome, Pickwickian syndrome, fatty liver; cerebral infarction, cerebral thrombosis, transient ischemic attack, orthopedic disorders, arthritis deformans, lumbodynia, emmeniopathy, and infertility. In particular, co-morbidities include: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, and other obesity-related conditions. “Treatment” (of obesity and obesity-related disorders) refers to the administration of the compounds of the present invention to reduce or maintain the body weight of an obese subject. One outcome of treatment may be reducing the body weight of an obese subject relative to that subject's body weight immediately before the administration of the compounds of the present invention. Another outcome of treatment may be preventing body weight regain of body weight previously lost as a result of diet, exercise, or pharmacotherapy. Another outcome of treatment may be decreasing the occurrence of and/or the severity of obesity-related diseases. The treatment may suitably result in a reduction in food or calorie intake by the subject, including a reduction in total food intake, or a reduction of intake of specific components of the diet such as carbohydrates or fats; and/or the inhibition of nutrient absorption; and/or the inhibition of the reduction of metabolic rate; and in weight reduction in patients in need thereof. The treatment may also result in an alteration of metabolic rate, such as an increase in metabolic rate, rather than or in addition to an inhibition of the reduction of metabolic rate; and/or in minimization of the metabolic resistance that normally results from weight loss. “Prevention” (of obesity and obesity-related disorders) refers to the administration of the compounds of the present invention to reduce or maintain the body weight of a subject at risk of obesity. One outcome of prevention may be reducing the body weight of a subject at risk of obesity relative to that subject's body weight immediately before the administration of the compounds of the present invention. Another outcome of prevention may be preventing body weight regain of body weight previously lost as a result of diet, exercise, or pharmacotherapy. Another outcome of prevention may be preventing obesity from occurring if the treatment is administered prior to the onset of obesity in a subject at risk of obesity. Another outcome of prevention may be decreasing the occurrence and/or severity of obesity-related disorders if the treatment is administered prior to the onset of obesity in a subject at risk of obesity. Moreover, if treatment is commenced in already obese subjects, such treatment may prevent the occurrence, progression or severity of obesity-related disorders, such as, but not limited to, arteriosclerosis, Type II diabetes, polycystic ovarian disease, cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, dermatological disorders, hypertension, insulin resistance, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and cholelithiasis. The obesity-related disorders herein are associated with, caused by, or result from obesity. Examples of obesity-related disorders include overeating and bulimia, hypertension, diabetes, elevated plasma insulin concentrations and insulin resistance, dyslipidemias, hyperlipidemia, endometrial, breast, prostate and colon cancer, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, cholelithiasis, gallstones, heart disease, abnormal heart rhythms and arrythmias, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, sudden death, stroke, polycystic ovarian disease, craniopharyngioma, the Prader-Willi Syndrome, Frohlich's syndrome, GH-deficient subjects, normal variant short stature, Turner's syndrome, and other pathological conditions showing reduced metabolic activity or a decrease in resting energy expenditure as a percentage of total fat-free mass, e.g, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Further examples of obesity-related disorders are metabolic syndrome, also known as syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome, sexual and reproductive dysfunction, such as infertility, hypogonadism in males and hirsutism in females, gastrointestinal motility disorders, such as obesity-related gastro-esophageal reflux, respiratory disorders, such as obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome), cardiovascular disorders, inflammation, such as systemic inflammation of the vasculature, arteriosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, hyperuricaemia, lower back pain, gallbladder disease, gout, and kidney cancer. The compounds of the present invention are also useful for reducing the risk of secondary outcomes of obesity, such as reducing the risk of left ventricular hypertrophy. The term “diabetes,” as used herein, includes both insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM, also known as type I diabetes) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM, also known as Type II diabetes). Type I diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes, is the result of an absolute deficiency of insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. Type II diabetes, or insulin-independent diabetes (i.e., non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), often occurs in the face of normal, or even elevated levels of insulin and appears to be the result of the inability of tissues to respond appropriately to insulin. Most of the Type II diabetics are also obese. The compounds of the present invention are useful for treating both Type I and Type II diabetes. The compounds are especially effective for treating Type II diabetes. The compounds of the present invention are also useful for treating and/or preventing gestational diabetes mellitus. U.S. Pat. No. 6,852,690, which is incorporated herein in its entirety, discloses methods for enhancing metabolism of nutrients comprising administering to a non-diabetic patient a formulation comprising a nutritively effective amount of one or more nutrients or any combination thereof and one or more insulinotropic peptides. The OXM peptide analogs disclosed herein are insulinotropic and can be administered to patients with a disturbed glucose metabolism such as insulin resistance but no overt diabetes, as well as patients who for any reason cannot receive nutrition through the alimentary canal. Such patients include surgery patients, comatose patients, patients in shock, patients with gastrointestinal disease, patients with digestive hormone disease, and the like. In particular, obese patients, atherosclerotic patients, vascular disease patients, patients with gestational diabetes, patients with liver disease such as liver cirrhosis, patients with acromegaly, patients with glucorticoid excess such as cortisol treatment or Cushings disease, patients with activated counterregulatory hormones such as would occur after trauma, accidents and surgery and the like, patients with hypertriglyceridemia and patients with chronic pancreatitis can be readily and suitably nourished according to the invention without subjecting the patient to hypo- or hyperglycemia. In particular, the administration to such a patient aims to provide a therapy to as rapidly as possible deliver the nutritional and caloric requirements to the patient while maintaining his plasma glucose below the so-called renal threshold of about 160 to 180 milligrams per deciliter of glucose in the blood. Although normal patients not having glucose levels just below the renal threshold can also be treated according to the invention as described above, patients with disturbed glucose metabolism such as hyperglycemic patients whose plasma glucose level is just above the renal threshold also find the therapy suitable for their condition. In particular, such patients who have a degree of hyperglycemia below the renal threshold at intermittent intervals can receive a combination treatment of nutrients plus insulinotropic peptides according to any of the following regimens. Normal patients not suffering from such hyperglycemia can also be treated using the peptide analogs disclosed herein. The OXM analogs disclosed herein may be used in a pharmaceutical composition when combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such compositions comprise a therapeutically-effective amount of one or more of the OXM analogs disclosed herein and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Such a composition may also be comprised of (in addition to the OXM analog disclosed herein and a carrier) diluents, fillers, salts, buffers, stabilizers, solubilizers, and other materials well known in the art. Compositions comprising the OXM analogs disclosed herein can be administered, if desired, in the form of salts provided the salts are pharmaceutically acceptable. Salts may be prepared using standard procedures known to those skilled in the art of synthetic organic chemistry. The term “individual” is meant to include humans and companion or domesticated animals such as dogs, cats, horses, and the like. Therefore, the compositions comprising formula I are also useful for treating or preventing obesity and obesity-related disorders in cats and dogs. As such, the term “mammal” includes companion animals such as cats and dogs. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic or organic bases and inorganic or organic acids.

It will be understood that, as used herein, references to the OXM analogs disclosed herein are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts. As utilized herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable” means a non-toxic material that does not interfere with the effectiveness of the biological activity of the active ingredient(s), approved by a regulatory agency of the Federal or a state government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia or other generally recognized pharmacopoeia for use in animals and, more particularly, in humans. The term “carrier” refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or vehicle with which the therapeutic is administered and includes, but is not limited to such sterile liquids as water and oils. The characteristics of the carrier will depend on the route of administration. The OXM analogs disclosed herein may be in multimers (for example, heterodimers or homodimers) or complexes with itself or other peptides. As a result, pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may comprise one ore more OXM analogs disclosed herein in such multimeric or complexed form. As used herein, the term “therapeutically effective amount” means the total amount of each active component of the pharmaceutical composition or method that is sufficient to show a meaningful patient benefit, i.e., treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of the relevant medical condition, or an increase in rate of treatment, healing, prevention or amelioration of such conditions. When applied to an individual active ingredient, administered alone, the term refers to that ingredient alone. When applied to a combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially, or simultaneously. The pharmacological composition can comprise one or more OXM analogs disclosed herein; one or more OXM analogs disclosed herein and one or more other agents for treating a metabolic disorder; or the pharmacological composition comprising the one or more OXM analogs disclosed herein can be used concurrently with a pharmacological composition comprising an agent for treating a metabolic disorder. Such disorders include, but are not limited to, obesity, metabolic syndrome or syndrome X, type II diabetes, complications of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemias, cardiovascular disease, gallstones, osteoarthritis, and certain forms of cancers. When the pharmacological composition comprises another agent for treating a metabolic disorder or the treatment includes a second pharmacological composition comprising an agent for treating a metabolic disorder, the agent includes, but are not limited to, cannabinoid (CB1) receptor antagonists, glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, lipase inhibitors, leptin, tetrahydrolipstatin, 2-4-dinitrophenol, acarbose, sibutramine, phentamine, fat absorption blockers, simvastatin, mevastatin, ezetimibe, atorvastatin, sitagliptin, metformin, orlistat, Qnexa, topiramate, naltrexone, bupriopion, phentermine, losartan, losartan with hydrochlorothiazide, and the like.

In yet another embodiment, the OXM analogs disclosed herein can be delivered in a controlled release system including, but not limited to: a delivery pump (See, for example, Saudek, et al., New Engl. J. Med. 321: 574 (1989) and a semi-permeable polymeric material (See, for example, Howard, et al., J. Neurosurg. 71: 105 (1989)). Additionally, the controlled release system can be placed in proximity of the therapeutic target (for example, the brain), thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose. See, for example, Goodson, In: Medical Applications of Controlled Release, 1984. (CRC Press, Bocca Raton, Fla.). The amount of the compositions comprising one or more of the OXM analogs disclosed herein which will be effective in the treatment of a particular disorder or condition will depend on the nature of the disorder or condition, and may be determined by standard clinical techniques by those of average skill within the art. In addition, in vitro assays may optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed in the formulation will also depend on the route of administration, and the overall seriousness of the disease or disorder, and should be decided according to the judgment of the practitioner and each patient's circumstances. Ultimately, the attending physician will decide the amount of the composition with which to treat each individual patient. Initially, the attending physician will administer low doses of the composition and observe the patient's response. Larger doses of the composition may be administered until the optimal therapeutic effect is obtained for the patient, and at that point the dosage is not increased further. In general, the daily dose range lie within the range of from about 0.001 mg to about 100 mg per kg body weight of a mammal, preferably 0.01 mg to about 50 mg per kg, and most preferably 0.1 to 10 mg per kg, in single or divided doses. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases. However, suitable dosage ranges for intravenous administration of the compositions comprising the one or more OXM analogs disclosed herein are generally about 5-500 micrograms (μg) of active compound per kilogram (Kg) body weight. Suitable dosage ranges for intranasal administration are generally about 0.01 pg/kg body weight to 1 mg/kg body weight. Effective doses may be extrapolated from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal model test systems. Suppositories generally contain active ingredient in the range of 0.5% to 10% by weight; oral formulations preferably contain 10% to 95% active ingredient. Ultimately the attending physician will decide on the appropriate duration of therapy using compositions comprising the one or more OXM analogs disclosed herein of the present invention. Dosage will also vary according to the age, weight and response of the individual patient. Further provided is a pharmaceutical pack or kit, comprising one or more containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical compositions and OXM analogs disclosed herein. Optionally associated with such container(s) may be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceuticals or biological products, which notice reflects approval by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration. All references disclosed herein are incorporated herein in their entirety. The following examples are intended to promote a further understanding of the present invention. Example 1 The synthesis of the Oxyntomodulin (OXM) analogs was essentially as follows. The OXM analogs shown in Table 2 below were synthesized by solid phase using Fmoc/t-Bu chemistry on a peptide multisynthesizer APEX 396 (Advanced Chemtech) using a 40-well reaction block. Each peptide was synthesized in a single well. For peptide amides, 0.1 g of an aminomethylated polystirene LL (100-200 mesh, 0.41 mmol/g) (Novabiochem) resin derivatized with a modified Rink linker p-[(R,S)-α-[9H-Fluoren-9-yl-methoxyformamido]-2,4-dimethoxybenzyl]-phenoxyacetic acid (Rink, H., 1987, Tetrahedron Lett. 28:3787-3789; Bernatowicz, M. S. et al., 1989, Tetrahedron Lett. 30:4645-4667) was used. All the amino acids were dissolved at a 0.5 M concentration in a solution of 0.5M HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole) in DMF. The acylation reactions were performed for 45 minutes with six-fold excess of activated amino acid over the resin free amino groups. The amino acids were activated with equimolar amounts of HBTU (2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) and a two-fold molar excess of DIEA (N,N-diisopropylethylamine). Alternatively, the peptides were synthesized by solid phase using Fmoc/t-Bu chemistry on a Pioneer Peptide Synthesizer (Applied Biosystems). In this case, 0.1 g of a resin Fmoc-Linker AM-Champion, 1% cross-linked (Biosearch Technologies, Inc.) and a PEG-PS-based resin derivatized with a modified Rink linker p-[(R,S)-α-[9H-Fluoren-9-yl-methoxyformamido]-2,4-dimethoxybenzyl]-phenoxyacetic acid (Rink, H., 1987, Tetrahedron Lett. 28:3787-3789; Bernatowicz, M. S. et al., 1989, Tetrahedron Lett. 30:4645-4667) was used. All the acylation reactions were performed for 60 minutes with a four-fold excess of activated amino acid over the resin free amino groups following the end of peptide assembly on the synthesizer; double coupling was performed for N-terminal Aib and His. The side chain protecting groups were: OMpe (O-3-Methyl-pent-3-yl) for Asp; tert-butyl for Glu, Ser, D-Ser, Thr and Tyr; trityl for Asn, Cys, Gln, and His; and, tert-butoxy-carbonyl for Lys, Trp; and, 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl for Arg. For OXM110 and OXM177, Lysine-Palmitoyl was manually acylated by reaction with equimolar amounts of HBTU (2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate) and a 2-fold molar excess of DIEA (N,N-diisopropylethylamine) The acylation reaction was performed for 120 minutes with a three-fold excess of activated acylant over the resin free amino groups. At the end of the synthesis, the dry peptide-resins were individually treated with 20 mL of the cleavage mixture, 88% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 5% phenol, 2% triisopropylsilane and 5% water (Sole, N. A. and G. Barany, 1992, J. Org. Chem. 57:5399-5403) for 1.5 hours at room temperature. Each resin was filtered and the solution was added to cold methyl-t-butyl ether in order to precipitate the peptide. After centrifugation, the peptide pellets were washed with fresh cold methyl-t-butyl ether to remove the organic scavengers. The process was repeated twice. Final pellets were dried, resuspended in H2O, 20% acetonitrile, and lyophilized. The crude peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC using preparative Waters RCM Delta-Pak™ C−4 cartridges (40×200 mm, 15 μm) and using as eluents (A) 0.1% TFA in water and (B) 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile. The following gradient of eluent B was used: 20%-20% over five minutes and 20%-35% over 20 minutes for the OXM229 (the peptide thiolated precursor of OXM36 and OXM115), OXM29 (the thiolated precursor of OXM70 and OXM216), OXM208 (the peptide thiolated precursor of OXM212), and OXM209 (the peptide thiolated precursor of OXM213). For peptides OXM110 and 177, the following gradient of eluent B was used: 32%-32% over five minutes and 32%-42% over 20 minutes flow rate 80 mL/min Analytical HPLC was performed on a Alliance Waters Chromatograph, with a ACE C-4 (300 A), 3 um column, 150×4.6 mm, (CPS analitica p/n ACE-213-1546), at 45 C.°, using H2O, 0.1% TFA (A) and CH3CN, 0.1% TFA (B) as solvents and the following linear gradient: 20%-20% B (in five minutes)—35% B (in 20 minutes)-80% B (in two minutes), flow 1 mL/min. The purified peptide was characterized by electrospray mass spectrometry on a Micromass LCZ platform. Example 2 Synthesis of Oxyntomodulin (OXM) cholesterylated analogs OXM36, OXM70, OXM115, OXM212, OXM213, and OXM216 was as follows. The reactions were run under conditions that permit the formation of a thioether bond. The cholesterylaled OXM peptides were then isolated using reverse-phase HPLC and characterized on a Micromass LCZ platform. The analogs OXM36, 70, 212, and 213 were synthesized from the thiol containing OXM peptide precursor OXM229, OXM208, and 209, respectively, by reaction with the bromo derivative, cholest-5-en-3-yl bromoacetate having the structure to produce conjugates attached via a thioether bond. Briefly, 30 mg of peptide precursor were dissolved in one mL of DMSO (conc. 30 mg/mL) and a one molar excess of cholest-5-en-3-yl bromoacetate dissolved in THF (conc. 20 mg/mL) was added. Then 1% by volume of DIPEA (N,N-diisopropyl-ethylamine) was added to the mixture; after 30 minutes of incubation, the peptide solution was purified by RP-HPLC and characterized on a Micromass LCZ platform. The peptides OXM115 and 216 were synthesized from the thiol containing OXM peptide precursor OXM229 and OXM29 to produce analogs by reaction with the bromo derivative, cholest-5-en-3-yl 1-bromo-2-oxo-6,9,12,15-tetraoxa-3-azaoctadecan-18-oate to produce conjugates attached via a thioether bond. Briefly, 30 mg of peptide precursor were dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO (conc. 30 mg/mL) and a one molar excess of cholest-5-en-3-yl 1-bromo-2-oxo-6,9,12,15-tetraoxa-3-azaoctadecan-18-oate dissolved in THF (conc. 20 mg/mL) was added. Then 3% by volume of DIPEA (N,N-diisopropyl-ethylamine) was added to the mixture; after 30 minutes of incubation, the peptide solution was purified by RP-HPLC and characterized on a Micromass LCZ platform. Example 3 PEGylation reactions were run under conditions permitting thioester bond formation. The PEGylated OXM peptide was then isolated using reverse-phase HPLC or ion exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography (SEC).

Example 5 Peptides OXM237-OXM308 and OXM345-OXM414 were synthesized by solid phase using Fmoc/t-Bu chemistry on a peptide multisynthesizer Simphony Protein Technologies Inc. For peptide amides 0.5 g of a resin Aminomethylated thioethers LL (100-200 mesh, 0.41 mmol/g) (Novabiochem) resin derivatized with a modified Rink linker p-[(R,S)-α-[9H-Fluoren-9-yl-methoxyformamido]-2,4-dimethoxybenzyl]-phenoxyacetic acid (Rink, H., 1987, Tetrahedron Lett. 28:3787-3789; Bernatowicz, M. S. et al., 1989, Tetrahedron Lett. 30:4645-4667) was used. For peptide acids 0.5 g of a resin Aminomethylated thioether LL (100-200 mesh, 0.41 mmol/g) (Novabiochem) resin derivatized with 4-hydroxymethylphenoxyacetic acid. All the amino acids were dissolved at a 0.5 M concentration in a solution of 0.5M HOBt (Hydroxybenzotriazole) in DMF. The acylation reactions were performed for 60 min with 8-fold excess of activated amino acid over the resin free amino groups. The amino acids were activated with equimolar amounts of HBTU (2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate), solution 0.5 M in DMF, and a 2-fold molar excess of DIEA (N,N-diisopropylethylamine), solution 2M in NMP. The side chain protecting groups were: Ompe (O-3-Methyl-pent-3-yl) for Asp; tert-butyl for Glu, Ser, D-Ser, Thr and Tyr; trityl for Asn, Cys, Gln and His; tert-butoxy-carbonyl for Lys, Trp; and, 2,2,4,6,7-pentamethyldihydrobenzofuran-5-sulfonyl for Arg; Boc-His(Trt)-OH was used in the synthesis. For peptides OXM392, 395 and 398, Glu16 and Lys20 were incorporated as Glu(Oall) and Lys(Alloc). At the end of the assembly the resins were dried, the protecting groups of Glu(Oall) and Lys(Alloc) were removed and the lactam bridge was formed by incubating the resin with 5 molar excess of HBTU and 10 molar excess of DIPEA.

We initially screened peptides in fluorescence cell based assays that measure production of cyclic-AMP (cAMP), using CHO cell lines stably expressing either recombinant human GLP-1R or human GCGR. Determination of Mouse and human GLP-1R and GCGR Agonist Activity was essentially as follows. CHO cells stably expressing mouse or human GLP-1R or GCGR were grown in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM), 10% FBS, 1 mM L-glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin (100 μ/mL) and 750 μg G418/mL for three-four days before harvesting using Enzymefree Dissociation Media (EFDM, Specialty Media). To determine GLP-1R and GCGR activity, OXM and OXM-Q3E were diluted in assay buffer and were incubated with cells in the absence or presence of 10% mouse plasma, respectively, for 30 min at room temperature. The assay was terminated with the addition of the LANCE kit Detection buffer as per the manufacturer's instructions. The plates were held an additional hour at room temperature, then increasing cAMP levels were detected by a decrease in TR-FRET signal as measured in an EnVision counter (PerkinElmer) in comparison to a standard curve of cAMP as per the manufacturer's instructions. Data were analyzed using the linear and nonlinear regression analysis software, GraphPad Prism. Evaluation of the utility of a dual GLP-1R/GCGR co-agonists (OXM mimetic) versus a GLP-1R selective agonist (GLP-1 mimetic) was as follows. First, in order to evaluate the therapeutic utility of a dual GLP-1R/GCGR agonist (OXM mimetic), a matched peptide that was selective for only the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1 mimetic), yet differs from native OXM by only one amino acid was identified. This peptide differed from native OXM by having a Glutamic acid (E) residue at position 3 instead of Glutamine (Q). A second GLP-1 mimetic was identified that had an aspartic acid residue (D) in place of the Q. The efficacy of the GLP-1 mimetic and the OXM mimetic in improving metabolic control in rodents were compared. These peptides and human OXM were synthesized and purified by GL Biochem (Shanghai) Ltd. In Table 4, the in vitro potencies and receptor binding affinities of native OXM and OXM-Q3E and OXM-Q3D peptides. Mutation of the third residue from the neutral Q to an acidic residue, e.g., D or E significantly reduces the potency of native oxyntomodulin to bind the glucagon receptor, while having minimal effect on the potency for the GLP-1 receptor.

As demonstration of in vivo efficacy for peptides is often confounded by inadequate pharmacokinetic properties, the perfused liver assay offers an alternative ex vivo method of assessing test peptides for activity in the functioning organ of interest. Animals for the In Vivo Assays: Lean or diet-induced obese 10-12-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Taconic Farms (Germantown, N.Y.) and housed in individual Tecniplast cages in a conventional SPF facility. Mice were maintained on either regular chow (Teklad 7012: 13.4% kcal from fat; Harlan Teklad) or high fat diet (D12492: 60% kcal from fat; Research Diets, Inc.) with ad libitum access to water in a 12-h ligh/12-h dark cycle unless stated otherwise. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. Male C57BL/6N mice were distributed by weight into treatment groups (n=6/group). On the morning of study, food was removed and mice were s.c. administered with vehicle (sterile water) OXM or OXM-Q3E at 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1 or 3 mg/kg. 10 min prior the glucose challenge. Blood glucose concentrations were determined at T=−10 min and T=0 min (baseline). Mice were then immediately challenged, intraperitoneally, with D-glucose (2 g/kg). One group of vehicle-treated mice was challenged with 0.9% saline as a negative control. Blood glucose levels were determined from tail bleeds taken at 20, 40 and 60 min after D-glucose challenge. The blood glucose excursion profile from T=0 to T=60 min was used to integrate the area under the curve (AUC) for each treatment. Percent inhibition values for each treatment were generated from the AUC data normalized to the saline-challenged controls. Areas under the curve (AUC) for glucose (AUC glucose) was calculated using the trapezoidal method. Statistics. Statistical analysis was done using unpaired 2-tailed Student's t test. P values<0.05 were reported as significant. Liver Glycogenolysis Assay. Humanized GCGR mice (C57B/6N) were anesthetized (Nembutal IP, 50 mg/kg) in the middle of the dark cycle. The portal vein was then cannulated and the liver was excised and perfused with a preoxygenated Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffered solution for 5-10 minutes which initially was not recirculated to wash out any endogenous substrates. The liver was then placed into a 20 mm NMR tube and the initial Krebs solution was exchanged for a Krebs-BSA perfusate (approx. 72 ml, 2.5% BSA), which was recirculated. 31P NMR spectroscopy was performed initially to examine the ATP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) levels to assess hepatic viability. A 13C NMR-visible pool of glycogen was then created by the addition of the gluconeogenic substrate [2-13C] Pyruvate and ammonium chloride (˜7 mM and 1 mM, respectively) to the perfusate, and the amount of 13C glycogen contained in the liver was monitored in real time via the Cl resonance of the glucosyl units in glycogen. After 45 minutes, OXM, OXM-Q3E, glucagon or vehicle was perfused and the subsequent response of glycogen levels was used to assess GCGR activation (Bergans et al., NMR Biomed. 16: 36-46, (2003)). Glucose dependent insulin secretion (GDIS). To measure GDIS, mouse pancreatic islets were isolated by the collagenase method using the procedure of pancreatic duct cannulation and density gradient purification (Mu et al., Diabetes 55: 1695-704, (2006)) and were incubated with 2 or 16 mmol/L glucose. Insulin was measured in aliquots of the incubation buffer by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay with a commercial kit (ALPCO diagnostics, Windham, N.H.). Animal study protocols were reviewed and approved by the Merck Research Laboratories Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in Rahway, N.J. 13C-NMR spectroscopy was used to non-invasively monitor glycogen and glucose levels in response to acute treatment with novel oxyntomodulin analogs in real time. Mice expressing human GCGR were anesthetized (Nembutal IP, 50 mg/kg) at approximately the middle of the dark cycle. The portal vein was then cannulated and tied off and the liver was excised. The liver was then placed into a 20 mm NMR tube and the initial Krebs solution was exchanged for a Krebs-BSA perfusate, which was recirculated. 31P NMR spectroscopy was performed initially to examine the ATP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) levels in the liver which can be used to assess hepatic viability. A 13C NMR-visible pool of glycogen was then created by the addition of the gluconeogenic substrate [2-13C] Pyruvate+NH4Cl and the amount of glycogen contained in the liver was monitored in real time via the Cl resonance of the glucosyl units in glycogen. After approximately 45 minutes, OXM or an OXM peptide analog was infused and the subsequent response of glycogen levels was used to assess human GCGR activation. The area of the Cl resonance of the glucosyl units in glycogen is plotted over time in FIG. 1 for livers that received either the OXM peptide analogs, 50 pM glucagon, or media. As can be seen below, native OXM induces glycogenolysis in a dose dependent fashion and induces full glycogenolysis at 1.5 nM and has an approximate EC50 of 0.5 nM, in comparison, OXM-Q3E induced only about 58% at 300 nM, consistent with its poor GCGR agonist potency. Given the ability of OXM to stimulate a robust glycogenolysis response, we further examined the in vivo GCGR receptor occupancy of OXM and OXM-Q3E in a competition assay in wild-type mice. Three cohorts of mice were dosed with either vehicle (total counts), vehicle and cold glucagon (non-specific binding), or OXM-Q3E subcutaneously. About 15 minutes post dose, 125I-glucagon was administered intra-venously and about 15 minutes later, the liver was collected and total radioactivity assayed. As shown in FIG. 2, glucagon (GCG) at 1.5 mpk gave 84% GCGR occupancy, 3 mpk OXM gave 31% GCGR occupancy, and OXM-Q3E gave 0% GCGR occupancy. Using the matched peptides, OXM, OXM-Q3E, we investigated both acute and chronic pharmacological effects of co-agonism of both receptors in a chronic hyperglycemic clamp and a chronic food intake (FI) and body weight (BW) study (Table 5) and in an acute intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT, FIG. 3). While both peptides effectively improved glucose tolerance, OXM-Q3E out-performed native OXM in reducing glucose excursion in both lean and diet induced obesity (DIO) mouse models. However, the native peptide proved superior at reducing food intake and body weight (ΔBW: −6% for OXM vs −2.4% for OXM-Q3E at 5 mg/kg) in DIO mice, an effect attributed to co-agonism of the GCGR. In both acute and chronic paradigms, native OXM did not cause increased glucose excursion.

DIO mice (16 wk on high fat diet) were anesthetized with xylazine and ketamine and catheterized through the right internal jugular vein 3 days before the in vivo studies. 25% glucose was infused and adjusted for the duration of the experiment to maintain hyperglycemia. Due to the short half-life of the peptides (both are rapidly inactivated by dipeptidyl peptidase IV and renally cleared (Zhu et al., J. Biol. Chem. 278: 22418-23, (2003))), vehicle, OXM (˜16 μg/kg/min) and OXM-Q3E (˜16 μg/kg/min) were infused intravenously during the last 60 minutes of the study. The venous catheter was used for infusion, and blood samples were collected from the tail vein. Each animal was monitored for food intake and weight gain after surgery to ensure complete recovery. Hyperglycemic clamps were performed in conscious, unrestrained, catheterized mice as previously described (Pocai et al., Nature. 43: 1026-31, (2005)). Briefly, plasma glucose was measured by OneTouch glucometer every 10 minutes during the 2 hour period. Twenty-five percent glucose (D-glucose, Sigma) was infused i.v. and the rate was adjusted periodically to clamp the plasma glucose levels (˜20 mM). One hour after the beginning of the infusion, OXM (˜16 μg/kg/min), OXM-Q3E (16 μg/kg/min) and vehicle (sterile saline) were administered for the rest of the period. Glucose infusion rate (GIR) was adjusted to body weight. The results of the hyperglycemic clamp assay are shown in FIGS. 3A and 3B. Blood glucose levels were maintained at about 20 mmol/L during the clamp. In OXM-Q3E treated animals, a quick and robust increase in glucose infusion (GIR, glucose infusion rate) was required to maintain hyperglycemia compared with vehicle-treated mice (GIRO-60 55±4 vs 6±2 mg/kg/min; OXM-Q3E vs vehicle; p<0.05). OXM also increased the glucose infusion rate required to maintain hyperglycemia (GIRO-60=40±4 vs 6±2 mg/kg/min; OXM vs vehicle, p<0.05) but the increase in GIR was about 30% lower than that in the OXM-Q3E group (GIRO-60=40±4 vs 55±4 mg/kg/min; OXM vs OXM-Q3E respectively, p<0.05), and the glucose lowering effect was delayed (by about 10 minutes) compared to OXM-Q3E treated mice, *p<0.05 vs vehicle. The effect of OXM or OXM-Q3E on glucose excursion in C57BL/6N lean mice was compared. FIGS. 4A and 4B show that both native and OXM peptide analogs reduce glucose excursion. The subcutaneous administration of either peptide, prior to dextrose challenge (Plasma Cmax) in an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT), significantly reduced blood glucose excursion in a dose-dependent manner. A comparison of the minimal effective dose indicates that OXM-Q3E is about 10-fold more effective at reducing glucose than native peptide (in vivo EC50 0.055 nM and 0.38 nM respectively). Example 8 Native OXM has an in vivo half-life (t1/2) of about 8 to 12 minutes in humans, unsuitable for sustained pharmacological therapy. Therefore, we investigated the addition of bulky substituents to the peptide to reduce renal clearance. Various molecular weight PEG moieties or N-ethyl maleimide were conjugated to the OXM peptide at various locations throughout the molecule, by conjugation to the side chain of an introduced cysteine residue. Positions that were investigated for conjugation with either Cys-N-ethyl malemide or a Cys-PEG moiety are underlined in the following amino acid sequence for OXM (SEQ ID NO:1) or placed at the C-terminus of the OXM. HSQGT FTSDY SKYLD SRRAQ DFVQW LMNTK RNRNN IA Unexpectedly, PEGylation (5 to 80 kDa) appeared to severely diminish the ability of the peptide analog to activate either the GCGR or both GLP-1R and GCGR. In some cases, introduction of an N-ethyl maleimide-capped cysteine residue was sufficient to significantly reduce activity. The results are shown in Table 6).

We initially conjugated the peptides with a cholesterol group via the cysteine side chain and again measured their ability to stimulate cAMP production in GLP-1R and GCGR transfected cell lines. C-terminal conjugation was the most favorable location for conjugation and OXM analogs with low nanomolar receptor potencies were identified. Unexpectedly, analysis of these peptides in the ex vivo liver perfusion glycogenolysis assay indicated that the in vitro GCGR agonist potency was not correctly reflecting GCGR activation in the liver (See OXM70 in FIG. 5). Measurement of agonist potency in 10 to 20% plasma added to the in vitro cell assay revealed a significant “serum shift” that effectively reduced the potency of the molecule by more than >40-fold (See Table 7), suggesting that the cholesteroylated molecules bound to lipid and/or protein in the plasma, reducing the effective concentration.

Example 10 In order to mitigate the effects of plasma binding on receptor engagement we employed a modified strategy to improve the pharmacokinetics by incorporating a hydrophilic linker between the peptide and the cholesterol group. Addition of a tetra-ethoxy linker (Oxa4) between the cholesterol moiety and the peptide significantly reduced the effect observed above when plasma was added to the cell based assay, i.e., reduced the “serum shift” to as little as 2 fold as shown in Table 8. Furthermore, substituting either aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) or D-Serine (D-Ser) at amino acid position two further improved both GLP-1R and GCGR affinity. We confirmed these in vitro observations in both the ex vivo glycogenolysis assay and the GCG receptor binding assay (See Table 8), obtaining results that confirmed that conjugation of a hydrophilically linked cholesterol group or an acyl chain resulted in identification of molecules that efficiently engaged and activated the GCGR.

We evaluated the efficacy of various lipidated peptides to reduce body weight, food intake (DIO mice) and improve glycemic control (lean mice) following both acute and chronic administration. As shown in FIGS. 6 through 9, following a single subcutaneous dose, the lipidated molecules significantly reduce food intake and body weight both acutely and with sustained efficacy. As predicted from the in vitro analysis, the analogs containing either acyl groups or a hydrophilic linker were significantly more efficacious than the other site-specific lipidated OXM analogs in reducing food intake and body weight in this model. FIGS. 6A and 6B summarize the acute in vivo efficacy of OXM70 on reducing food intake and body weight in established DIO mice. FIGS. 7A and 7B summarize the acute in vivo efficacy of OXM110 and OXM177 on reducing food intake and body weight in established DIO mice. FIGS. 8A and 8B summarizes the acute in vivo efficacy of OXM216, OXM115, and OXM177 on reducing food intake and body weight in established DIO mice. In all three experiments, Ad libitum fed, DIO male C57BL/6 mice (about 51 g each) were weighed and dosed ip with either vehicle (water) or OXM analog OXM70, OXM110, OXM177, OXM216, or OXM115 about 30 minutes prior to the onset of the dark phase. Food intake was measured about two hours and 18 hours later. Body weight changes at 18 hours (overnight) were also measured *P<0.05 vs. vehicle, n=5-6 per group). Chronic Food Intake & Body Weight Effects To determine the chronic effects of the analogs on energy and glucose metabolism, studies were performed in an established diet induced obesity (DIO) mouse model. Ad libitum fed male C57BL/6N wild-type mice (n=6 per group, mean body weight ˜50 g) were dosed with vehicle, OXM115, OXM177, OXM110 at 3 or 10 mg/kg every other day (Q2D) during the course of a 14-consecutive-day study. Body weight, food intake and basal glucose levels were measure daily. As shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B, chronic treatment with the lipidated analogs significantly reduced body weight and food intake in a dose dependent manner throughout the duration of the study. FIG. 9C shows the basal glucose over the time period of the study in response to the various peptides. All the lipidated peptides tested significantly reduced basal glucose in a dose dependent manner throughout the duration of the study compared with day 0 of the chronic study and with vehicle-treated animals in the same day (p<0.05). An IPGTT was carried out on day 13, showed that glucose tolerance was improved following chronic administration of the lipidated analogs, in a dose dependent manner (FIG. 9D). Improvement Glucose Tolerance As shown in FIGS. 10 through 13, in C57BL/6N lean mice IPGTT, the subcutaneous administration of the OXM peptide analogs, prior to dextrose challenge timed appropriately to correspond to the Plasma Cmax, significantly reduced blood glucose excursion in a dose-dependent manner, for all lipidated analogs tested. Metabolic Rate Effects In order to establish whether administration of the tetra-ethoxy-linked cholestroylated OXM115 analog confers a metabolic rate, a chronic study was performed, with a single injection of OXM115. Male B6 DIO mice (average starting body weight 55 g) were acclimated to metabolic rate chambers without food at thermoneutrality (T 29° C.). A three hour period from 6:00 to 9:00 am was used to calculate resting metabolic rate. Three hours into the light phase (9:00 am), vehicle (dH2O), OXM115 at 3 or 10 mg/kg was administered subcutaneously. The total cycle time was set for 20 minutes, consisting of a reference reading with a 70 second settling time and a 10 second measure period as well as 60 second settle time and 10 second measure time for each of the 16 cages. Results shown in FIGS. 14A and B show that administration of OXM115 dose dependently increased the acute metabolic rate in DIO mice. FIG. 15 summarizes the acute in vivo efficacy of OXM303, OXM304, and OXM305 on reducing food intake and body weight in established DIO mice and shows OXM305 as being particularly efficacious at reducing food intake and reducing body weight. Ad libitum fed, DIO male C57BL/6 mice (about 50 g each) were weighed and dosed s.c. with either vehicle (water) or OXM analogs 30 minutes prior to the onset of the dark phase. Food intake was measured two hours, 18, and 42 hours later. Body weight changes at 18 and 42 hours (overnight) were also measured (*P<0.05 vs. vehicle, n=5-6 per group). FIG. 16 summarizes the acute in vivo efficacy of OXM395, OXM399, OXM400, and OXM401 on reducing food intake and body weight in established DIO mice. OXM401 is a 0/+ control peptide having the sequence HAibEGTFTSDYSKYLDSRRAQDFVQWLmNTK-γEγE-C(Oxa12Chol) (SEQ ID NO:99). Established DIO mice (˜52 g each) were dosed sc with vehicle (30% HBC) or peptide 1 mg/kg about 30 minutes prior to the onset of the dark phase. Food intake and body weight changes were measured over a four day time period (* P<0.05 vs. vehicle, n=5 per group). Example 11 This example shows that lipidated peptides with a pI above 7 based on the OXM sequence stimulate mast cell degranulation while lipidated peptides with a pI of about 5 appears not to stimulate mast degranulation. To assess the histamine releasing potential of oxyntomodulin analogs, we established an in vitro counterscreening assay using the human mast cell line LAD2. LAD2 cells (50,000 cells/well, 96-well plate) were incubated with compounds for 30 minutes. The degranulation of LAD2 cells was determined by quantification of the β-hexosaminidase released into the supernatants and in cell lysates after hydrolysis of 4-methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminide Results are expressed as percentage of β-hexosaminidase release, calculated as percent of total content. Table 1 summarizes the degranulation potency (EC50) of OXM analogues in LAD2 cells. The results suggest that to reduce the likelihood of stimulating degranulation of mast cells, the pI for lipidated based analogues should be around 5.
