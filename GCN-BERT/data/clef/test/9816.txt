This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. provisional application No. 61/320,905, filed Apr. 5, 2010, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference as if written herein in its entirety. This invention was made with support from the U.S. Government under Contract No. DOD 05118004 and NIH No. 1U54HD053177-01A1. The U.S. Government has certain rights to this invention. Disclosed herein are new non-hormonal steroid compounds and compositions and their application as pharmaceuticals for the treatment of disease. Methods of modulation of NF-κB activity in a human or animal subject are also provided for the treatment of diseases mediated by NF-κB. Muscular wasting diseases, such as muscular dystrophies, are a group of degenerative diseases that culminate in progressive skeletal muscle wasting leading to muscle weakness, a high incidence of bone fracture, wheelchair dependence, and in some cases death. Of the muscular dystrophies, Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most severe and most widely recognized. Another muscular wasting disease which shows similar symptoms, although less severe than Duchenne muscular dystrophy, is Becker muscular dystrophy. Even though the defective dystrophin gene causing both Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy has been known for over 20 years, a cure is still lacking. Several catabolic factors that act to destroy host tissues during the cachectic process have been identified. It appears that the oversecretion of inflammatory cytokines, specifically tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), is one of the most likely causes of cachexia. Specifically, TNF-α can mimic most of the abnormalities that occur in cachexia such as weight loss, anorexia, increased thermogenesis, changes in lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, and muscle wasting. Muscle atrophy can also be induced by the loss of innervation or damage to innervation of the muscle tissue. Diseases such as chronic neuropathy and motor neuron disease can cause damage to innervation. Physical injury to the nerve can also lead to damage to the innervation of the muscle tissue. Alternatively, muscle atrophy can be the result of environmental conditions such as during spaceflight or as a result of aging or extended bed rest. Under these environmental conditions, the muscles do not bear the usual weight load, resulting in muscle atrophy from disuse. Specifically, during muscle disuse, intracellular processes are activated to induce proteolysis, mainly through the ATP dependent ubiquitin proteasome pathway, which regulates the NF-κB pathway. NF-κB is known to mediate extracellular signals responsible for the induction of genes involved in pro-inflammatory responses. NF-κB is sequestered in the cytoplasm of most non-stimulated cells through a non-covalent interaction with one of several proteins known as inhibitors of kappa-beta (IκBs) (May & Ghosh, (1997) Semin Cancer. Biol. 8, 63-73; May & Ghosh, (1998) Immunol. Today 19, 80-88; Ghosh et al., (1998) Annu. Rev. Immunol. 16, 225-260). Cellular stimuli associated with pro-inflammatory responses such as TNF-α activate kinases, which in turn activate NF-κB by phosphorylating IκBs. The kinases that phosphorylate IκBs are called IκB kinases (IKKs). Phosphorylation targets IκBs for subsequent ubiquitination and degradation. This degradation of IκBs reveals the nuclear localization signal on NF-κB, allowing nuclear accumulation of activation, which leads to binding of DNA and control of specific gene expression. Phosphorylation of IκB is therefore an important step in the regulation of NF-κB downstream of many stimuli, although other mechanisms can lead to the activation of functional NF-κB. The identification and characterization of kinases that phosphorylate IκBs has led to a better understanding of signaling pathways involving NF-κB activation. Several different subtypes of IKK have been identified thus far. IKKα was initially identified as an IκB kinase induced by TNF-α stimulation in HeLa cells (DiDonato et al., (1997) Nature 388, 548-554). Another IκB kinase homologous to IKKα was identified, termed IKKβ, and determined to be the major IκB kinase induced following TNFα stimulation (Takeda et al., (1999) Science 284, 313-316; U.S. Pat. No. 6,030,834, issued to Pots et al. (2000); U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,302, issued to Woronicz et al. (1999)). IKKα and IKKβ have an overall homology of 52% and a 65% homology in the kinase domain (Zandi et al., (1997) Cell 91, 243-252). IκB protein kinases (IKKs) phosphorylate IκBs at specific serine residues. Specifically, they phosphorylate serines 32 and 36 of IκBζ (Traenckner et al., (1995) EMBO J. 14, 2876-2883; DiDonato et al., (1996) Mol. Cell. Biol. 16, 1295-1304). Phosphorylation of both sites is required to efficiently target IκBα for degradation. Furthermore, activation of IKKα and IκKβ is usually in response to NF-κB activating agents including phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-1 (IL-1), TNF-α, reactive oxygen species, and DNA damaging agents. Mutant IKKα and IKKβ, which are catalytically inactive, can be used to block NF-κB stimulation. IκB kinases are therefore essential in the regulation of NF-κB activation processes downstream of inflammatory stimuli. In other pathways, IκB kinases may not be important. IKKα and IKKβ have distinct structural motifs including an amino terminal serine-threonine kinase domain separated from a carboxyl proximal helix-loop-helix domain by a leucine zipper domain. These structural characteristics are unlike other kinases, and the non-catalytic domains are thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions. As such, proteins which bind to IKKs should be capable of regulating the activity of NF-κB and potentially regulating downstream events such as induction of NF-κB. For instance, NEMO (NF-κB Essential Modulator) is a protein which has been identified to bind to IKKs and facilitate kinase activity (Yamaoke et al., (1998) Cell 93, 1231-1240; Rothwarf et al., (1998) Nature 395, 287-300). In vivo studies have shown that chronic NF-κB activation is associated with muscular wasting diseases such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and is further illustrated in US 2007/0225315 (Mar. 15, 2007). Specifically, muscle wasting was largely prevented in subjects that were heterozygous for the p65/RelA NF-κB subunit. An injection of an NF-κB activation inhibitor peptide was found to inhibit the dystrophic phenotype in affected mice subjects. Without being bound by a particular theory, it appears that chronic activation of NF-κB is required for the muscle wasting symptoms of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. As such, a drug-based therapy targeting NF-κB can be an effective strategy to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy, as well as other forms of muscular wasting diseases. In general, muscular wasting diseases may be treated in accordance with the present disclosure with a direct or indirect modulator of NF-κB. Indirect modulators of NF-κB include, for example, inhibitors of IκB kinases (IKKs) such as IKKα inhibitors and IKKβ inhibitors, and inhibitors functioning directly upstream from IKKs in the signaling pathway such as inhibitors of phosphoinositide dependent kinase (PDK) and inhibitors of Akt (also referred to as PKB). As noted above, one suitable approach for modulating the NF-κB pathway is by binding to one of the IκB protein kinases (IKKs). By binding the IKKs, phosphorylation of IκBs is blocked and NF-κB cannot be activated. In one embodiment, direct inhibiting compounds of IKK catalytic activity can be administered for the purpose of blocking the NF-κB pathway and inhibiting a muscular wasting disease. Specifically, inhibitors of IKKα or their enantiomers, analogs, prodrugs, active metabolites, salts, and/or hydrates thereof can be administered to the subject for the purpose of inhibiting a muscular wasting disease. Novel compounds and pharmaceutical compositions, certain of which have been found to modulate NF-κB have been discovered, together with methods of synthesizing and using the compounds including methods for the treatment of NF-κB-mediated diseases in a patient by administering the compounds.

Additionally, the compounds disclosed herein can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like. In general, the solvated forms are considered equivalent to the unsolvated forms. The term “bond” refers to a covalent linkage between two atoms, or two moieties when the atoms joined by the bond are considered to be part of larger substructure. A bond may be single, double, or triple unless otherwise specified. A dashed line between two atoms in a drawing of a molecule indicates that an additional bond may be present or absent at that position. The term “disease” as used herein is intended to be generally synonymous, and is used interchangeably with, the terms “disorder” and “condition” (as in medical condition), in that all reflect an abnormal condition of the human or animal body or of one of its parts that impairs normal functioning, is typically manifested by distinguishing signs and symptoms, and causes the human or animal to have a reduced duration or quality of life. The term “NF-κB-mediated disease,” refers to a disease in which NF-κB plays an active role in the disease pathology. NF-κB-mediated diseases include diseases in which multiple biological pathways and/or processes in addition to NF-κB-mediated processes contribute to the disease pathology. A NF-κB-mediated disease may be completely or partially mediated by modulating the activity or amount of NF-κB. In particular, a NF-κB-mediated disease is one in which modulation of NF-κB results in some effect on the underlying disease e.g., administration of a NF-κB modulator results in some improvement in at least some of the patients being treated. The term “NF-κB-mediated disease” also refers to the following diseases, even though the compounds disclosed herein exert their effects through biological pathways and/or processes other than NF-κB: muscular dystrophy, arthritis, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, sepsis, rheumatic disease, cancer atherosclerosis, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, leptospiriosis renal disease, glaucoma, retinal disease, ageing, headache, pain, complex regional pain syndrome, cardiac hypertrophy, muscle wasting, catabolic disorders, obesity, fetal growth retardation, hypercholesterolemia, heart disease, chronic heart failure, ischemia/reperfusion, stroke, cerebral aneurysm, angina pectoris, pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, acid-induced lung injury, pulmonary hypertension, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Sjogren's syndrome, hyaline membrane disease, kidney disease, glomerular disease, alcoholic liver disease, gut diseases, peritoneal endometriosis, skin diseases, nasal sinusitis, mesothelioma, anhidrotic ecodermal dysplasia-ID, behcet's disease, incontinentia pigmenti, tuberculosis, asthma, crohn's disease, colitis, ocular allergy, appendicitis, paget's disease, pancreatitis, periodonitis, endometriosis, inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory lung disease, silica-induced diseases, sleep apnea, AIDS, HIV-1, autoimmune diseases, antiphospholipid syndrome, lupus, lupus nephritis, familial mediterranean fever, hereditary periodic fever syndrome, psychosocial stress diseases, neuropathological diseases, familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, inflammatory neuropathy, parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, alzheimer's disease, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, huntington's disease, cataracts, and hearing loss. The term “combination therapy” means the administration of two or more therapeutic agents to treat a therapeutic condition or disorder described in the present disclosure. Such administration encompasses co-administration of these therapeutic agents in a substantially simultaneous manner, such as in a single capsule having a fixed ratio of active ingredients or in multiple, separate capsules for each active ingredient. In addition, such administration also encompasses use of each type of therapeutic agent in a sequential manner. In either case, the treatment regimen will provide beneficial effects of the drug combination in treating the conditions or disorders described herein. “NF-κB modulator is used herein to refer to a compound that exhibits an EC50 with respect to NF-κB activity of no more than about 100 μM and more typically not more than about 50 μM, as measured in the NF-κB inhibitor assays described generally hereinbelow. “EC50” is that concentration of modulator which either activates or reduces the activity or increases or decreases the amount of an enzyme (e.g., (NF-κB)) to half-maximal level. Certain compounds disclosed herein have been discovered to exhibit modulatory activity against NF-κB. In certain embodiments, compounds will exhibit an EC50 with respect to NF-κB of no more than about 10 μM; in further embodiments, compounds will exhibit an EC50 with respect to NF-κB of no more than about 5 μM; in yet further embodiments, compounds will exhibit an EC50 with respect to NF-κB of not more than about 1 μM; in yet further embodiments, compounds will exhibit an EC50 with respect to NF-κB of not more than about 200 nM, as measured in the NF-κB assay described herein. The phrase “therapeutically effective” is intended to qualify the amount of active ingredients used in the treatment of a disease or disorder. This amount will achieve the goal of reducing or eliminating the said disease or disorder. The term “therapeutically acceptable” refers to those compounds (or salts, prodrugs, tautomers, zwitterionic forms, etc.) which are suitable for use in contact with the tissues of patients without undue toxicity, irritation, and allergic response, are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and are effective for their intended use. As used herein, reference to “treatment” of a patient is intended to include prophylaxis. The term “patient” means all mammals including humans. Examples of patients include humans, cows, dogs, cats, goats, sheep, pigs, and rabbits. Preferably, the patient is a human. The term “prodrug” refers to a compound that is made more active in vivo. Certain compounds disclosed herein may also exist as prodrugs, as described in Hydrolysis in Drug and Prodrug Metabolism: Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Enzymology (Testa, Bernard and Mayer, Joachim M. Wiley-VHCA, Zurich, Switzerland 2003). Prodrugs of the compounds described herein are structurally modified forms of the compound that readily undergo chemical changes under physiological conditions to provide the compound. Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compound by chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to a compound when placed in a transdermal patch reservoir with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent. Prodrugs are often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier to administer than the compound, or parent drug. They may, for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas the parent drug is not. The prodrug may also have improved solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent drug. A wide variety of prodrug derivatives are known in the art, such as those that rely on hydrolytic cleavage or oxidative activation of the prodrug. An example, without limitation, of a prodrug would be a compound which is administered as an ester (the “prodrug”), but then is metabolically hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid, the active entity. Additional examples include peptidyl derivatives of a compound. The compounds disclosed herein can exist as therapeutically acceptable salts. The present invention includes compounds listed above in the form of salts, including acid addition salts. Suitable salts include those formed with both organic and inorganic acids. Such acid addition salts will normally be pharmaceutically acceptable. However, salts of non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be of utility in the preparation and purification of the compound in question. Basic addition salts may also be formed and be pharmaceutically acceptable. For a more complete discussion of the preparation and selection of salts, refer to Pharmaceutical Salts Properties, Selection, and Use (Stahl, P. Heinrich. Wiley-VCHA, Zurich, Switzerland, 2002). The terms “therapeutically acceptable salt,” or “salt,” as used herein, represents salts or zwitterionic forms of the compounds disclosed herein which are water or oil-soluble or dispersible and therapeutically acceptable as defined herein. The salts can be prepared during the final isolation and purification of the compounds or separately by reacting the appropriate compound in the form of the free base with a suitable acid. Representative acid addition salts include acetate, adipate, alginate, L-ascorbate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate (besylate), bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, digluconate, formate, fumarate, gentisate, glutarate, glycerophosphate, glycolate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hippurate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethansulfonate (isethionate), lactate, maleate, malonate, DL-mandelate, mesitylenesulfonate, methanesulfonate, naphthylenesulfonate, nicotinate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylproprionate, phosphonate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, pyroglutamate, succinate, sulfonate, tartrate, L-tartrate, trichloroacetate, trifluoroacetate, phosphate, glutamate, bicarbonate, para-toluenesulfonate (p-tosylate), and undecanoate. Also, basic groups in the compounds disclosed herein can be quaternized with methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides, and iodides; dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl, and diamyl sulfates; decyl, lauryl, myristyl, and steryl chlorides, bromides, and iodides; and benzyl and phenethyl bromides. Examples of acids which can be employed to form therapeutically acceptable addition salts include inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, and phosphoric, and organic acids such as oxalic, maleic, succinic, and citric. Salts can also be formed by coordination of the compounds with an alkali metal or alkaline earth ion. Hence, the present invention contemplates sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium salts of the compounds disclosed herein, and the like. Basic addition salts can be prepared during the final isolation and purification of the compounds by reacting a carboxy group with a suitable base such as the hydroxide, carbonate, or bicarbonate of a metal cation or with ammonia or an organic primary, secondary, or tertiary amine. The cations of therapeutically acceptable salts include lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and aluminum, as well as nontoxic quaternary amine cations such as ammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, triethylamine, diethylamine, ethylamine, tributylamine, pyridine, N,N-dimethylaniline, N-methylpiperidine, N-methylmorpholine, dicyclohexylamine, procaine, dibenzylamine, N,N-dibenzylphenethylamine, 1-ephenamine, and N,N′-dibenzylethylenediamine. Other representative organic amines useful for the formation of base addition salts include ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperidine, and piperazine. In certain embodiments, the salts may include hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfonate, citrate, tartrate, phosphonate, lactate, pyruvate, acetate, succinate, oxalate, fumarate, malate, oxaloacetate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, benzenesulfonate and isethionate salts of compounds disclosed herein. A salt of a compound can be made by reacting the appropriate compound in the form of the free base with the appropriate acid. While it may be possible for the compounds of the subject invention to be administered as the raw chemical, it is also possible to present them as a pharmaceutical formulation. Accordingly, provided herein are pharmaceutical formulations which comprise one or more of certain compounds disclosed herein, or one or more pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, prodrugs, amides, or solvates thereof, together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers thereof and optionally one or more other therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be “acceptable” in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. Any of the well-known techniques, carriers, and excipients may be used as suitable and as understood in the art; e.g., in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. The pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may be manufactured in any manner known in the art, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping or compression processes. The formulations include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramuscular, intravenous, intraarticular, and intramedullary), intraperitoneal, transmucosal, transdermal, rectal and topical (including dermal, buccal, sublingual and intraocular) administration although the most suitable route may depend upon for example the condition and disorder of the recipient. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Typically, these methods include the step of bringing into association a compound of the subject invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, amide, prodrug or solvate thereof (“active ingredient”) with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. Formulations of the compounds disclosed herein suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus, electuary or paste. Pharmaceutical preparations which can be used orally include tablets, push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbitol. Tablets may be made by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with binders, inert diluents, or lubricating, surface active or dispersing agents. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active ingredient therein. All formulations for oral administration should be in dosages suitable for such administration. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with filler such as lactose, binders such as starches, and/or lubricants such as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft capsules, the active compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, liquid paraffin, or liquid polyethylene glycols. In addition, stabilizers may be added. Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used, which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses. The compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in powder form or in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or sterile pyrogen-free water, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous (oily) sterile injection solutions of the active compounds which may contain antioxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, such as ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers or agents which increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. For oral or parenteral use, the compounds may be formulated as nanoparticle preparations. Such nanoparticle preparations can include, for example, nanoshere encapsulations of active compounds, inactive nanoparticles to which active compounds can be tethered, or nanoscale powders of active compounds. Nanoparticle preparations can be used to increase the bioavailability of the active compounds, control the rate of release of the active compounds, or deliver active compounds to a particular location in the body. See A. Dove, “An Easy Pill to Swallow”, Drug Discovery & Development Magazine: 11(11), November, 2008, pp. 22-24. In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a sparingly soluble salt. For buccal or sublingual administration, the compositions may take the form of tablets, lozenges, pastilles, or gels formulated in conventional manner. Such compositions may comprise the active ingredient in a flavored basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth. The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, or other glycerides. Certain compounds disclosed herein may be administered topically, that is by non-systemic administration. This includes the application of a compound disclosed herein externally to the epidermis or the buccal cavity and the instillation of such a compound into the ear, eye and nose, such that the compound does not significantly enter the blood stream. In contrast, systemic administration refers to oral, intravenous, intraperitoneal and intramuscular administration. Formulations suitable for topical administration include liquid or semi-liquid preparations suitable for penetration through the skin to the site of inflammation such as gels, liniments, lotions, creams, ointments or pastes, and drops suitable for administration to the eye, ear or nose. The active ingredient for topical administration may comprise, for example, from 0.001% to 10% w/w (by weight) of the formulation. In certain embodiments, the active ingredient may comprise as much as 10% w/w. In other embodiments, it may comprise less than 5% w/w. In certain embodiments, the active ingredient may comprise from 2% w/w to 5% w/w. In other embodiments, it may comprise from 0.1% to 1% w/w of the formulation. Formulations for topical administration in the mouth, for example buccally or sublingually, include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavored basis such as sucrose and acacia or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in a basis such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia. For administration by inhalation, compounds may be conveniently delivered from an insufflator, nebulizer pressurized packs or other convenient means of delivering an aerosol spray. Pressurized packs may comprise a suitable propellant such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Alternatively, for administration by inhalation or insufflation, the compounds according to the invention may take the form of a dry powder composition, for example a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. The powder composition may be presented in unit dosage form, in for example, capsules, cartridges, gelatin or blister packs from which the powder may be administered with the aid of an inhalator or insufflator. Preferred unit dosage formulations are those containing an effective dose, as herein below recited, or an appropriate fraction thereof, of the active ingredient. It should be understood that in addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations described above may include other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for example those suitable for oral administration may include flavoring agents. Compounds may be administered orally or via injection at a dose of from 0.1 to 500 mg/kg per day. The dose range for adult humans is generally from 5 mg to 2 g/day. Tablets or other forms of presentation provided in discrete units may conveniently contain an amount of one or more compounds which is effective at such dosage or as a multiple of the same, for instance, units containing 5 mg to 500 mg, usually around 10 mg to 200 mg. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. The compounds can be administered in various modes, e.g. orally, topically, or by injection. The precise amount of compound administered to a patient will be the responsibility of the attendant physician. The specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diets, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the precise disorder being treated, and the severity of the indication or condition being treated. Also, the route of administration may vary depending on the condition and its severity. In certain instances, it may be appropriate to administer at least one of the compounds described herein (or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, or prodrug thereof) in combination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example only, if one of the side effects experienced by a patient upon receiving one of the compounds herein is hypertension, then it may be appropriate to administer an anti-hypertensive agent in combination with the initial therapeutic agent. Or, by way of example only, the therapeutic effectiveness of one of the compounds described herein may be enhanced by administration of an adjuvant (i.e., by itself the adjuvant may only have minimal therapeutic benefit, but in combination with another therapeutic agent, the overall therapeutic benefit to the patient is enhanced). Or, by way of example only, the benefit of experienced by a patient may be increased by administering one of the compounds described herein with another therapeutic agent (which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has therapeutic benefit. By way of example only, in a treatment for diabetes involving administration of one of the compounds described herein, increased therapeutic benefit may result by also providing the patient with another therapeutic agent for diabetes. In any case, regardless of the disease, disorder or condition being treated, the overall benefit experienced by the patient may simply be additive of the two therapeutic agents or the patient may experience a synergistic benefit. In any case, the multiple therapeutic agents (at least one of which is a compound disclosed herein) may be administered in any order or even simultaneously. If simultaneously, the multiple therapeutic agents may be provided in a single, unified form, or in multiple forms (by way of example only, either as a single pill or as two separate pills). One of the therapeutic agents may be given in multiple doses, or both may be given as multiple doses. If not simultaneous, the timing between the multiple doses may be any duration of time ranging from a few minutes to four weeks. Thus, in another aspect, certain embodiments provide methods for treating NF-κB-mediated disorders in a human or animal subject in need of such treatment comprising administering to said subject an amount of a compound disclosed herein effective to reduce or prevent said disorder in the subject, in combination with at least one additional agent for the treatment of said disorder that is known in the art. In a related aspect, certain embodiments provide therapeutic compositions comprising at least one compound disclosed herein in combination with one or more additional agents for the treatment of NF-κB-mediated disorders. Specific diseases to be treated by the compounds, compositions, and methods disclosed herein include ageing, headache, pain, complex regional pain syndrome, cardiac hypertrophy, muscular dystrophy, muscle wasting, catabolic disorders, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, obesity, fetal growth retardation, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, heart disease, chronic heart failure, ischemia/reperfusion, stroke, cerebral aneurysm, angina pectoris, pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, acid-induced lung injury, pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hyaline membrane disease, kidney disease, glomerular disease, alcoholic liver disease, leptospiriosis renal disease, gut diseases, peritoneal endometriosis, skin diseases, nasal sinusitis, mesothelioma, anhidrotic ecodermal dysplasia-ID, behcet's disease, incontinentia pigmenti, tuberculosis, asthma, arthritis, crohn's disease, colitis, ocular allergy, glaucoma, appendicitis, paget's disease, pancreatitis, periodonitis, endometriosis, inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory lung disease, sepsis, silica-induced diseases, sleep apnea, AIDS, HIV-1, autoimmune diseases, antiphospholipid syndrome, lupus, lupus nephritis, familial mediterranean fever, hereditary periodic fever syndrome, psychosocial stress diseases, neuropathological diseases, familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy, inflammatory neuropathy, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, rheumatic disease, alzheimer's disease, amyotropic lateral sclerosis, huntington's disease, retinal disease, cataracts, hearing loss, and cancer.

It is expected that these compounds when made will have activity similar to those that have been made and tested. The activity of the compounds in Examples 1-7 and 9-10 as NF-κB modulators is illustrated in the following assays. The other compounds listed above, which have not yet been made and/or tested, are predicted to have activity in these assays as well. Biological Activity Assay In Vitro NF-kB Inhibitor Screening Assay C2C12 skeletal muscle cells stably transfected with a luciferase reporter construct regulated under multiple copies of the NF-kB response element (Panomics, Fremont, Calif.) were used to screen NF-kB inhibitors. These cells were maintained at 37° C. with 5% CO2 in a tissue culture incubator with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) medium containing 10% Fetal bovine serum (FBS) (ATCC, Manassas, Va.), Penicillin 100 U/ml, Streptomycin 100 μg/ml, and 100 μg/ml Hygromysin B (Roche, Indianapolis, Ind.). Screening assays were performed in myoblasts (grown in medium containing 10% FBS) in duplicate 96 well plates at a cell concentration of 5×104 cells per well in 100 ul volume. Cells were pretreated with various concentrations (0.01 ug/ml to 10 ug/ml) of compound for 24 hr duration before stimulating with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (10 ng/ml) for another 24 hrs. Prednisolone was included in every plate tested as a positive control. After the completion of incubation cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with cell lysis buffer to measure luciferase activity (Promega Corp, Madison, Wis.) using Centro LB 960 luminometer (Berthold technologies, GmbH & Co, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Relative luminescence units with TNF-α stimulation in the absence of drugs were considered as 100% percent and data was represented as % inhibition relative to TNF-α induced NF-kB activation. Some of the compounds disclosed herein were tested in the C2C12 skeletal muscle cell luciferase assay and exhibited ≧100% inhibition at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 ug/mL; 80-100% inhibition at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 ug/mL; 60-80% inhibition at concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 ug/mL; 40-60% inhibition at concentrations of 1 and 10 ug/mL; and 20-40% inhibition at concentrations of 10 ug/mL. Cell viability was assayed in duplicate plates by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) (Sigma, Saint Louis, Mo.) as per manufacturer's protocols. Percent cell viability was calculated relative to untreated cells. There was not a significant decrease in cell viability (<80%) for any of compounds tested at any of the doses (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 ug/mL) tested. Inhibition of NF-kB Nuclear Translocation Inhibition of TNF-α induced NF-kB activation was confirmed by nuclear translocation immunofluorescence assay. C2C12 cells were grown on cover slips and treated with TNF-α and compound at optimal concentrations as described above. Cells were fixed with acetone and stained with a rabbit anti-NF-kB (p60) antibody/anti-rabbit Texas red (Santa Cruz Biotech, Inc, Santa Cruz, and CA) and counterstained with 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole HCl (DAPI) (Invitrogen, CA) to visualize the nuclei. Some of the compounds disclosed herein were tested in the nuclear translocation immunofluorescence assay and blocked TNF-α induced NF-kB nuclear translocation. In Vivo mdx Mouse Model of Dystrophy Separate groups (n=12-14) of mdx mice were treated with prednisolone (5 mg/kg/day; per oral in feed), Example 1 (20 and 40 mg/kg/day; per oral in feed) and Example 2 (20 and 40 mg/kg/day; per oral in feed) for 3 months. All mice underwent 30 min biweekly treadmill exercise during the treatment duration to unmask the mild disease phenotype of mdx mouse model. Effect on Body Weight (BM) Prednisolone treated mice showed significantly lower body weight (P<0.05) than untreated mice at 33.8 weeks age. Mice treated with some of the compounds disclosed herein at 20 and 40 mg/kg/day dosages gained significantly more body weight and gastrocnemius muscle mass than untreated mice. Effect on In Vivo Motor Coordination and Strength Motor coordination and strength were assessed using Rota-rod (Ugo Basile, VA, Italy) testing. Briefly, mice were trained on the rota-rod for two days before collecting data. Each acclimatization session consisted of four training sessions, 2 per day and each session lasting 120 seconds at a speed of 5 rpm). Each trial consisted of placing the mice on the rod at 10 rpm for 60 seconds (stabilizing period) followed by an acceleration from 10 rpm to 40 rpm within the first 25 seconds until the animal fell from the rod or until 180 seconds are reached. If the animals fell during the stabilizing period, they were placed back on the rod to complete the session. The total testing time was 240 seconds (60 seconds stabilization time and 180 seconds test time). Each trial was performed twice a day (2 hour interval between sessions) for 3 consecutive days. The latency to fall (seconds) was recorded and all six scores were averaged per mouse. The average data was expressed as latency to fall (in seconds) for each group mice at 3 age groups. The ability of untreated mice to stay on the rod did not change significantly with time. Mice treated with some of the compounds disclosed herein at 20 and 40 mg/kg/day dosages showed increased latency to fall at 12, 24, or 36 weeks. In some instances, latency to fall was decreased or unchanged, increased by 0-10%, increased by 10-20%, increased by 20-30%, or increased by 30-40%. Effect on In Vitro Force Contractions: The distal tendon of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle was tied securely to the lever arm of a servomotor/force transducer (model 305B, Aurora Scientific, Richmond Hill, ON, Canada) and the proximal tendon to a tissue clamp. Muscles were stimulated between two platinum electrodes. With supramaximal stimulation of the muscle using single 0.2-ms square stimulation pulses for the EDL, muscle length was adjusted to the length (Lo) that resulted in maximal twitch force. With the muscle held at Lo using stimulation frequencies of 30, 50, 80, 100, 120 and 150 Hz, the maximum isometric tetanic force force (Po) developed during a 300 ms train of stimulation pulses was recorded for the EDL muscle. The muscle length was then measured with calipers and after removal of the muscle from the bath the mass of the muscle was determined. For each muscle, the optimum fiber length (Lf) was calculated by multiplying Lo by a previously determined Lf/Lo ratio of 0.45. Total muscle fiber cross-sectional area was determined by dividing the wet mass by the product of Lf and the density of mammalian skeletal muscle (1.06 mg/mm3). Maximum isometric specific force (sPo) was determined by dividing Po by the total muscle fiber cross-sectional area. There was no statistically significant (P<0.05) difference in specific force between untreated and prednisolone groups. Mice treated with some of the compounds disclosed herein at 20 and 40 mg/kg/day dosages showed statistically significant (P<0.05) increased isometric specific force. In some instances, isometric specific force was decreased or unchanged, increased by 0-5%, increased by 5-10%, increased by 10-15%, or increased by 15-20%. Histological Evaluations Hematoxylin and Eosin staining of gastrocnemius muscle of untreated mdx mice show significant degeneration and inflammation. Skeletal muscle from Example 1- and Example 2-treated mice showed significant decrease in inflammation, degeneration, and increase in regenerating muscle fibers in comparison to untreated and prednisolone treated mdx mice. Continuous administration of prednisolone appeared to increase degeneration and decrease in regeneration of dystrophic skeletal muscle. Glucocorticoid Receptor Binding Assay To determine the receptor binding affinity of example compounds to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a ligand binding assay was performed using cDNA expression clones (Baculovirus) for human and mouse glucocorticoid receptor-alpha. Liver extracts containing different GR constructs were incubated with radiolabeled 3H-Dexamethsone (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and test compound in assay buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 20 mM sodium molybdate, pH 7.6). The amount of radioactivity was measured using a scintillation plate reader. Dexamethasone showed competitive binding with 3H-dexamethasone at micromolar concentrations. Some of the compounds disclosed herein were tested in the glucocorticoid receptor binding assay and found to have no significant (>75%) competitive binding to the glucocorticoid receptor at millimolar concentrations. From the foregoing description, one skilled in the art can easily ascertain the essential characteristics of this invention, and without departing from the spirit and scope thereof, can make various changes and modifications of the invention to adapt it to various usages and conditions. 1.
