PHARMACOKINETICS OF IONTOPHORETIC SUMATRIPTAN ADMINISTRATION Related Applications: This application claims priority to U.S. Application Serial No. 12/142,604, filed June 19, 2008, the entire contents of which hereby are incorporated herein by reference. Background The process of iontophoresis was described by LeDuc in 1908 and has since found commercial use in the delivery of ionically charged therapeutic agent molecules such as pilocarpine, lidocaine and dexamethasone. hi this delivery method, ions are carried into the skin by an electrical current that is supplied by a positive and negative electrode. Postive ions are carried away from the positive anode, while negative ions are carried away from the negative cathode. Earlier, and some present, iontophoretic devices have been typically constructed of two electrodes attached by adhesive materials to a patient, each connected by a wire to a remote power supply. A recent publication has indicated that sumatriptan can be transdermally transported effectively using iontophoresis (Femenia-Font et aL J. Pharm. Sci., 94, 2183-2186, 2005). In this study, iontophoretic transport of sumatriptan was found to be at a rate 385 fold higher than passive transport.

Detailed Description One advantage of the methods of the present invention over oral administration of sumatriptan is that there is less variation of pharmacokinetic parameters with the present invention as compared to oral or nasal delivery, In contrast to oral delivery of sumatriptan, the amount of variance between the subjects after being administered sumatriptan iontophoretically is a fraction of the amount of variance between the subjects after being administered sumatriptan orally. Another advantage the methods of the present invention is that the methods allow sumatriptan to be administered such that the AUCo-mf is similar to that of other dosage forms such as systemic, oral, or nasal administration, while the C^ax is substantially reduced. By doing this, the amount of sumatriptan delivered systemically may be similar to the other methods, but concentration spiking is preferably reduced. Another advantage of the methods of the present invention is that the concentration of sumatriptan in the subject generally reaches therapeutic levels less than an hour after administration begins. Furthermore, therapeutic levels of sumatriptan may be maintained for a desired length of time, e.g., four to five hours. The methods of the invention can be described, at least in part, by the use of pharmacokinetic parameters. Pharmacokinetic parameters may be calculated using methods known in the art.

Each of the treatment periods were separated by a 2 day washout period. During the screening period, each subject had a physical examination, including vital signs, a hepatitis screen, HIV screen, urine drug screening, an electrocardiogram, pregnancy test (females only), ethanol breath test and clinical laboratory tests. In addition, the medical history and demographic data including age and race was recorded. All assessments were conducted no more than 28 days prior to the first dosing. Subjects who met all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria were admitted on Day -1. During the confinement periods, subjects did not engage in strenuous activity and abstained from alcohol and tobacco. During each confinement period, the subjects received study dosing after an overnight fast. The subjects were dosed at 0800 hours on Day 1 of each dosing period. For periods I and 2, the subjects were confined to the study center the morning before dosing of Treatment A (Day -1) and through the 24 hour post dose assessments for Treatment Β. For periods 3-5, the subjects were confined to the study center the morning before dosing of Treatment C (Day -1) and through the 24 hour post dose assessments for Treatment Ε. Each dosing period lasted approximately 2 days with at least a 2 day washout period between dosings. Study participants were between 19 and 50 years old. The patches for Treatments A and C were applied to a clean, dry, relatively hairfree area of the upper arm. Treatments were applied to alternating arms. The patches for Treatments D and Ε were applied to a clean, dry, relatively hair free area of the upperback. Treatments were applied to alternating right and left positions on the upper back. ΡΚ blood samples were scheduled for collection per subject for each of the five periods, For Treatments A and Β, 4 rnL blood samples for sumatriptan plasma concentrations were collected by catheter or venipuncture into EDTA collection tubes at the scheduled collection times. For Treatments C, D and Ε, 2.7 mL blood samples for sumatriptan plasma concentrations were collected by catheter or venipuncture into EDTA collection tubes at the scheduled collection times. Blood samples were cooled in an ice bath and centrifuged as soon as possible after collection, Plasma samples were stored in labeled tubes at -20°C. Standard safety assessments were also performed during each treatment period and at the conclusion of the study, including adverse event monitoring, clinical safety laboratory tests, and vital signs, lontophoretic delivery system assessments including adhesion and dermal irritation and the amount of adhesive residue on the skin were performed during Treatments A, C, D and Ε. The subjects were healthy adult volunteers (four males and five females) who were willing to attend the clinic for five treatment periods. The subjects received no other medication (prescription or over-the-counter) for two weeks prior to study entry, unless approved by the designated physician. Study participants were between 19 and 50 years old. The mean age was 28 years old. The five treatments, as described in Table 1, were administered in five clinical periods. Four of the five dosing treatments were using the patches comprising the formulations of the invention. The patch was applied to the upper arm or upper back depending on the Treatment period. In treatment Β, the subjects received an Imigran FTab oral tablet (100 mg sumatriptan succinate) with 240 mL of water after an overnight fast. Subjects remained fasted for 4 hours after dosing. The drug reservoir pad (anode) formulation for Treatment A, C, D and Ε was: 10% polyamine formulation plus 4% sumatriptan succinate (loaded with up to 120 mg of sumatriptan). The salt reservoir pad (cathode) formulation for Treatments A, C, D and Ε was: 2% hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) and NaCl. There were no serious adverse events reported during the study periods. The most frequently reported adverse event was headache related to Treatment Β (sumatriptan succinate 100 mg oral tablet) and tingling and itching at patch site for patch treatments A, C, D and Ε. Mean skin erythema scores were also calculated for each of the patch treatments. Immediately after patch removal, mean scores were 1.40 or below for each of the four patch treatments. After 72 hours, the mean scores were each below 1,00. Nine subjects were dosed with patch Treatment A and Treatment Β, the 100 mg sumatriptan oral tablet. Seven subjects were treated with patch Treatments C, D, and Ε. Descriptive statistics for the ΡΚ parameters. AUCo-inf, AUCo-ba, Cma?;, TmM, Lambda and fie , were calculated. Arithmetic means of AUCo-inf range from 99 to 144 ng/mL for patches (Treatment A: 99 ng/mL; Treatment C: 99 ng/mL; Treatment D: 144 ng/mL; and Treatment Ε: 105 ng/mL) and is about 225 ng/mL^h for Treatment Β. Arithmetic means of half-life (Τ½) range from 2.6 to 3 hours for the patches (Treatment A: 3.0 hr; Treatment C: 2.7 hr; Treatment D: 2.6 hr; and Treatment Ε: 2.5 hr) and is about 3.4 hours for Treatment Β. The results of analysis of variance among the treatment groups in AUCo-inf, AUCo-bst, and Cm,; were also analyzed. Treatment Β (sumatriptan 100 mg oral tablet) is statistically different (p<0.001) from all patch treatments (A, C, D, and Ε) studied in all ΡΚ parameters. Treatment A and C are somewhat similar in their ΡΚ profile; both are different from Treatment D in AUCo-mf, AUCo-hst, and Cmax; both are not different from Treatment Ε in AUCs, Furthermore, both Treatment A and Treatment C have lower Cmax compared to Treatment Ε. Example 2: Study of Patch Pharmacokinetics as Compared to Oral, Nasal and Subcutaneous Injections of Sumatriptan In this example, the iontophoretic patches of the invention were compared to the currently approved oral, subcutaneous (SQ) injection and nasal spray formulations of lmitrex® in healthy volunteers. The bioavailability of the drag was compared to the bio availability relative to the 6 mg SQ injection. This was a single center, open label, randomized, single-dose, crossover study, wherein subjects were to receive seven study treatments in sequence according to the randomization schedule, separated by a 3 to 10 day washout period. The drug being tested was sumatriptan succinate in the iontophoretic patch of the invention. The patch was compared to three formulations of lmitrex® (100 mg oral sumatriptan succinate tablet (Treatment Β), 6 mg subcutaneous injection (Treatment C) and 20 mg intranasal spray (Treatment D)). Subjects were admitted on Day -1, at least 12 hours prior to dosing on Day 1 of each treatment period, and remained in the clinical unit under supervision until the last PIC sample was obtained. During each treatment period, blood was obtained at prescribed times for ΡΚ analysis. Subjecrs A total of 25 subjects (12 females and 13 males) were enrolled in the study and all received sumatriptan. Overall, 16 (64%) subjects completed the study, Four subjects withdrew consent; 3 subjects discontinued the study due to an adverse event; 1 subject was lost to follow-up; and, I subject discontinued due to a protocol violation. Study participants were between 21 and 57 years old. All 25 enrolled subjects were treated with sumatriptan: 23 subjects received control treatments (Treatments Β (100 mg oral sumatriptan succinate tablet), C (6 mg subcutaneous injection), and D (20 mg intranasal spray)) and 17 subjects had at least one patch of the invention (Treatments A, Ε, F or G, as shown in Table 2).

The plasma samples were analyzed by a validated HPLC with MS/MS detection. The following ΡΚ parameters were determined: Tjras, λ,. tw, AUCo-te, AUCo-mf and total body clearance (Cl/F). The bioavailability (F) of the non-parenteral formulations were assessed relative to the SQ injection. ΡΚ parameters for sumatriptan were calculated from the actual plasma concentration-time data using non-compartmental method with WinNonlin™ computer program. ΡΚ parameters for each treatment were reported along with descriptive statistics. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare AUCo-mf and C,mx values between treatments, AUCo-hst, TmM and tm were summarized descriptively. The mean clearance for the 17 subjects who had Treatments F and G was 544S3 mL/hr. Table 3 below provides a summary of arithmetic means of the pharmacokinetic parameters for each treatment group.

Both treatments F and G yielded AUCo-inf of approximately 113 hri'ng/mL. Arithmetic means of C,„-,x for oral, nasal, and injection groups were 51.6 ng/mL, 12.5 ng/mL, and 82.2 ng/mL, respectively. Arithmetic means of Cmax for the patches ranged from 24.7 ng/mL (Treatment F) to 23.1 ng/mL (Treatment G). TmM was 0.25 hour for the injection, 1,45 hour for nasal, and 2.24 hour for the oral formulation. Apparent Tm3X for Treatment F was 1.65 hour and Treatment G was 2.53 hour.

The elimination half-life after removing the patch was 2.94 hours for Treatment F and 2.86 hours for Treatment G. The terminal half-life for the oral formulation in this study may have appeared greater than previously reported (See, e.g., Duquesnoy C, et a!., Eur, J. Pharm. Sci., 6:99-104 (1998) and Jhee SS et αℓ., Clin. Pharmacokinet., 40:189-205 (2001)) because of the high sensitivity of PPD LCMS method used (limit of quantification equal 0.200 ng/mL), resulting in quantification of clinically insignificant levels, possibly reflecting the presence of a deep compartment, Safely> Evaluation: There were no deaths or serious adverse events reported in this study. There were no unexpected adverse events or a significant increase in the frequency of commonly reported adverse events in subjects receiving the patch of the invention compared with oral, nasal and subcutaneous administration of sumatriptan. Atypical sensations, and pain and pressure sensations, which are commonly reported for oral and subcutaneous sumatriptan (as shown in Table 5), were not reported following the Treatments F and G patch. This may reflect in part the lower Cmax levels obtained with the patch treatments. Adverse events were also categorized into two special groupings; (1) Atypical Sensations and (2) Pain and Pressure Sensations. This was done to be consistent with current triptan labeling which sought to capture both various short-lived side effects associated with triptans (i.e., sensation of warmth / cold, paresthesias) and which are grouped as “Atypical Sensations”, and “Pain and Pressure Sensations”. The majority of these adverse events, Atypical Sensations and Pain and Pressure Sensations (Table 5), occurred in close proximity to the T„ws in subjects treated with oral and subcutaneous sumatriptan.

Regarding treatments with the iontophoretic patch of the invention overall, no subject in this study had a skin irritation score of 3 or 4 at any time. There were no subject discontinuations directly attributable to patch treatments (application site disorders). Skin irritation scores were either scored 0 or i by 72 hours. Skin irritation scores were statistically better (ΐ.℮., lower mean score) for Treatment F compared to Treatment G at 48 and 72 hours post patch removal. At 72 hours or at 10 day follow-up, all skin irritation scores were “0” (no erythema). At the time of patch removal, more than 75% of the subjects had minimal or no erythema. By 48 hours post patch removal all subjects had minimal or no erythema (ΝΒ: one assessment was not done for Treatment F). At 72 hours all of the subjects treated with Treatment F had no erythema (ΝΒ: one assessment was not done for Treatment F). For subjects that had minimal erythema at 72 hours (35.3% of Treatment G subjects) the erythema completely resolved by the day 10 follow-up, In general, these findings (Table 6) were not clinically different from those observed in subjects treated with Patches A and Ε.

The sumatriptan plasma concentration time curves for both the iontophoretic patches of the invention were not substantially different from each other, indicating that transdermal delivery of sumatriptan is not significantly influenced by differences in formulation loading in the 2,6-3,0 gram range. Treatments using the patches of the invention yielded pharmacokinetics of plasma sumatriptan intermediate between Treatment D (20 mg sumatriptan nasal spray) and Treatment Β (100 mg sumatriptan oral tablets). The patches of the invention delivered sumatriptan with CmM of 23-25 ng/mL and sustained plasma concentrations of sumatriptan in this range for the full 4 hours of current flow. These results confirm and extend pharmacokinetic data obtained in Example 1.
