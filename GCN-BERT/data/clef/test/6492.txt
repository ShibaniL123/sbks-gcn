Step B: 5-(2-Methyl-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridin-3-yl)-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-one. A microwave vial was charged with 3-bromo-2-methyl-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-b]pyridine (53 mg, 0.19 mmol), 5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-one (74 mg, 0.28 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (22 mg, 0.019 mmol), sat. aq. Na2CO3 (0.65 mL), and 1,4-dioxane (2.6 mL). The headspace was evacuated and immediately refilled with N2 (3×). The reaction vial was capped, sealed, and heated in an oil bath at 90° C. for 18 h. After cooling to rt, the mixture was diluted with EtOAc and H2O. The aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (2×), and the combined organics dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was purified by reverse-phase HPLC on a XBridge C18 column (5 μm, 100×4.6 mm), mobile phase of 10-100% ACN in 20 mM NH4OH, to afford the title compound as a white solid (24 mg, 37% yield).
