Pharmaceutical Composition against Chronic Bacterial Infections The present invention relates to a polypeptide comprising a peptidoglycan hydrolase for use as a medicament for the treatment of chronic bacterial infections. The present invention further relates to a polypeptide comprising a peptidoglycan hydrolase comprising an endopeptidase, N-acetyl-muramoyl-L-alanine-amidase, N-acetyl-muramidase, N-acetyl- glucosaminidase and/or lytic transglycosylase. One of the challenges in bacterial infectious diseases is the problem of chronic infections, which require long durations of antibiotic treatment and often reoccur. Chronic bacterial infections are typically caused by bacteria "persisters", i.e. a small subpopulation of bacteria that survive an antibiotic treatment by essentially shutting down metabolism, even as their counterparts, who are in a normal metabolic state, are killed off. As a result, the patient initially appears to be fully recovered, but over the course of weeks or months, the persisters start returning to life, often stronger and more aggressive than ever before, and the illness is back. Said bacterial persistence is a major obstacle to the successful treatment of infectious bacterial diseases. It can stretch illnesses out over months, cause bacterial infections to spread to kidneys and other organs, and raise treatment costs extremely. Unlike antibiotic resistant bacteria, whose ability to withstand drug treatments is based on genetic differences, persisters are genetically identical to the other members of their bacterial community. Persisters are often called antibiotics tolerant bacterial strains. Given its significant negative impact, bacterial persistence has become a growing threat. Moreover, up to date, no treatment that directly targets persisters is known. Bacterial persistence has been verified in a number of species, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Mycobacterium spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella. It is assumed that all bacterial pathogens can establish life-long chronic infections. Thus, there is a need for antibacterial agents that treat chronic bacterial infections. This object is solved by the subject matter defined in the claims. The following figure serves to illustrate the invention. Figure 1 shows in a schematic diagram the bactericidal effect of a polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 123 (lOx and 3 Ox MIC) on isolated persister fractions of P. aeruginosa PA14 (light grey) and PA1255 (dark grey) is compared to ciprofloxacin (lOxMIC and 30xMIC), both in the absence and presence of 0.5 mM EDTA. Controls include 0.5 mM EDTA and ofloxacin (lOxMIC and 30xMIC). Mean values (± SEMs) are shown for at least three independent replicates. Figure 2 shows A. baumannii RUH 134 persister killing by the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 126 and the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 125. The bactericidal effects of the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 126 (30xMIC) and the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 125 (30xMIC) on isolated persister fractions are compared to those of ciprofloxacin (30xMIC), in both the absence and the presence of 0.5 mM EDTA. Additional controls include 0.5 mM EDTA and tobramycin (30xMIC). Mean values (± standard error of the mea [SEM]) are shown for at least three independent replicates (except for the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 125). The control shows the number of persisters before treatment. Figure 3 shows E. coli UTI-89 persister killing by the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 124. The bactericidal effects of the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 124 (10* MIC) on isolated persister fractions are compared to those of ciprofloxacin (l OxMIC), in both the absence and the presence of 0.5 mM EDTA. Additional control is 0.5 mM EDTA. Figure 4 shows /'. aeruginosa PA14 persister killing by the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 124. The bactericidal effects of the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 124 (3 O MIC) on isolated persister fractions are compared to those of ciprofloxacin (30xMIC), in both the absence and the presence of 0.5 mM. EDTA. Additional controls include 0.5 mM EDTA and ofloxacin The term "polypeptide" as used herein refers in particular to a polymer of amino acid residues linked by peptide bonds in a specific sequence. The amino acid residues of a polypeptide may be modified by e.g. covalent attachments of various groups such as carbohydrates and phosphate. Other substances may be more loosely associated with the polypeptide, such as heme or lipid, giving rise to conjugated polypeptides which are also comprised by the term "polypeptide" as used herein. The term as used herein is intended to encompass also proteins. Thus, the term "polypeptide" also encompasses for example complexes of two or more amino acid polymer chains. The term "polypeptide" does encompass embodiments of polypeptides which exhibit optionally modifications typically used in the art, e.g. biotinylation, acetylation, pegylation, chemical changes of the amino-, SH- or carboxyl-groups (e.g. protecting groups) etc.. As will become apparent from the description below, the polypeptide of to the present invention may also be a fusion protein, i.e. linkage of at least two amino acid sequences which do not occur in this combination in nature. The term "polypeptide" as used herein is not limited to a specific length of the amino acid polymer chain, but typically the polypeptide will exhibit a length of more than about 50 amino acids, more than about 100 amino acids or even more than about 150 amino acids. Usually, but not necessarily, a typical polypeptide of the present invention will not exceed about 750 amino acids in length. The term„cell wall " as used herein refers to all components that form the outer cell enclosure of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and thus guarantee their integrity. In particular, the term„cell wall" as used herein refers to peptidoglycan, the outer membrane of the Gram- negative and peptidoglycan of Gram-positive bacteria with the lipopolysaccharide, the bacterial cell membrane, but also to additional layers deposited on the peptidoglycan as e.g. capsules, outer protein layers or slimes.

The term "tag" in contrast to the term "amino acid sequence stretch" as used herein refers to a peptide which can be useful to facilitate expression and/or affinity purification of a polypeptide, to immobilize a polypeptide to a surface or to serve as a marker or a label moiety for detection of a polypeptide e.g. by antibody binding in different ELISA assay formats as long as the function making the tag useful for one of the above listed facilitation is not caused by the positively charge of said peptide. However, the His6-tag may, depending on the respective pH, also be positively charged, but is used as affinity purification tool as it binds to immobilized divalent cations and is not understood to be a "amino acid sequence stretch" as used herein. Preferably an amino acid sequence stretch as used herein as a length of about 6 to about 39 amino acid residues. As used herein, the term "cationic peptide" refers preferably to a peptide having positively charged amino acid residues. Preferably a cationic peptide has a pKa- value of 9.0 or greater. Typically, at least four of the amino acid residues of the cationic peptide can be positively charged, for example, lysine or arginine. "Positively charged" refers to the side chains of the amino acid residues which have a net positive charge at about physiological conditions. The term "cationic peptide" as used herein refers also to polycationic peptides, but also includes cationic peptides which comprise for example less than 20%, preferably less than 10% positively charged amino acid residues.

As used herein, an "antimicrobial peptide" (AMP) may in particular be a peptide which is not a cationic peptide, polycationic peptide, amphiphatic peptide, sushi peptide, defensins, and hydrophobic peptide, but nevertheless exhibits antimicrobial activity. The term "sushi peptide" as used herein refers to complement control proteins (CCP) having short consensus repeats. The sushi module of sushi peptides functions as a protein-protein interaction domain in many different proteins. Peptides containing a Sushi domain have been shown to have antimicrobial activities. Preferably, sushi peptides are naturally occurring peptides. The term "amphiphatic peptide" as used herein refers to synthetic peptides having both hydrophilic and hydrophobic functional groups. Preferably, the term "amphiphatic peptide" as used herein refers to a peptide having a defined arrangement of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups e.g. amphiphatic peptides may be e.g. alpha helical, having predominantly non polar side chains along one side of the helix and polar residues along the rest of its surface.

The term "comprising" as used herein shall not be construed as being limited to the meaning "consisting of (i.e. excluding the presence of additional other matter). Rather, "comprising" implies that optionally additional matter may be present. The term "comprising" encompasses as particularly envisioned embodiments falling within its scope "consisting of (i.e. excluding the presence of additional other matter) and "comprising but not consisting of (i.e. requiring the presence of additional other matter), with the former being more preferred. The present invention relates to a polypeptide comprising a peptidoglycan hydrolase for use as a medicament for the treatment of chronic bacterial infections. In particular, the present relates to a polypeptide comprising a peptidoglycan hydrolase for use as a medicament for the treatment of chronic bacterial, infections, wherein the peptidoglycan hydrolase is an endolysin and wherein the chronic bacterial, infection is associated wit Pseudomonas (e.g. Pseudotnonas aeruginosa), Escherichia, (e.g. E. coli), Staphylococcus spp. (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus), Acinetobacter (e.g. Acinetobacter baumanii), Mycobacterium spp. (e.g. Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), Listeria monocytogenes and/or Salmonella bacteria. The present invention further relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a polypeptide comprising a peptidoglycan hydrolase for use as a medicament for the treatment of chronic bacterial infections. In particular it relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a polypeptide comprising a peptidoglycan hydrolase for use as a medicament for the treatment of chronic bacterial infections, wherein the peptidoglycan hydrolase is an endo!ysin and wherein the chronic bacterial infection is associated with Pseudomonas (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa), Escherichia (e.g. E. coli), Staphylococcus spp. (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus), Acinetohacter (e.g. Acinetobacter baumanii), Mycobacterium spp. (e.g. Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), Listeria monocytogenes and/or Salmonella bacteria. The polypeptide of the present invention comprising the peptidoglycan hydrolase is composed of an amino acid molecule having the amino acid sequence of an endopeptidase, N-acetyl- muramoyl-L-alanine-amidase (amidase), N-acetyl-muramidase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase or lytic transglycosylase and thus is suitable for degrading the peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls. The polypeptide of the present invention thus exhibits the activity of a peptidoglycan hydrolase, i.e. is capable of degrading bacterial peptidoglycan. The peptidoglycan hydrolase may be composed of an amino acid molecule having at least the amino acid sequence selected from the group of an endopeptidase, N-acetyl-muramoyl-L-alanine-amidase (amidase), N- acetyl-muramidase, N-acetyl-glucosaminidase and lytic transglycosylase, i.e. the peptidoglycan hydrolase may have more than one peptidoglycan hydrolyzing activities. The peptidoglycan structure of a bacterial cell wall is overall largely conserved with minor modifications (Schleifer & Kandler 1972). Bacterial species have interpeptide bridges composed of different amino acids or may even lack an interpeptide bridge. In peptidoglycan structures lacking an interpeptide bridge a Diaminopimelic acid (DAP ) or meso- Diaminopimelic acid (mDAP; an amino acid, representing an epsilon-carboxy derivative of lysine being a typical component of peptidoglycan) (Diaminopimelic acid is residue replaces the amino acid L-Lys and directly cross-links to the terminal amino acid D-Ala of the opposite peptide chain. Thus, there are limited types of chemical bonds available that can be hydro lyzed by peptidoglycan hydrolases. The peptidoglycan hydrolases exhibit at least one enzyme domain having an enzymatic activity as listed above. In addition the peptidoglycan hydrolases may contain at least one domain suitable for binding to the peptidoglycan and supporting the enzymatic activity of the peptidoglycan hydrolase. The binding domains are typically called cell-wall binding domains (CBD). Preferably a domain having enzymatic activity is the N-acetylglucosaminidase that hydro lyzes the glycan component of the peptidoglycan on the reducing side of GlcNAc. Examples of peptidoglycan hydrolases exhibiting the N-acetylglucosaminidase activity are autolysins, e.g. AltA from Enterococcus faecalis (Mesnage et al., 2008) or Acm A, Acm B, Acm C, and Acm D from Lactococcus lactis (Steen et al, 2007). Further examples are endolysins, e.g. the LambdaSa2 endolysin (Pritchard et al, 2007). Further preferably, a domain having enzymatic activity is the N-acetyl-muramidase that hydrolyzes the glycan component of the peptidoglycan on the reducing side of MurNAc, i.e. the hydrolysis of the beta-(l->4) linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetyl-D- glucosamine residues in a peptidoglycan. Furthermore, N-acetyl-muramidase hydrolyzes N- acetyl-D-glucosamine residues in chitodextrins. The EC number of N-acetyl-muramidase is EC 3.2.1.17 with alternative names for N-acetyl-muramidase like 1 ,4-N-acetylmuramidase, mucopeptide, glucohydrolase, mucopeptide, N-acetylmuramoylhydrolase, muramidase, Ν,Ο- diacetylmuramidase, and peptidoglycan N-acetylmuramoylhydrolase. Examples of peptidoglycan hydrolases exhibiting the N-acetyl-muramidase activity are autolysins, exolysins, bacteriocins, and endolysins, e.g.: Cpl -1 endolysin (Garcia et al, 1987), B30 endolysin (Pritchard et al, 2004), Cpl-7 (Garcia et al, 1990). Further preferably, a domain having enzymatic activity is the lytic transglycosylase that hydrolyzes the same bond as muraminidases, but form N-acetyl-l,6-anhydro-muramyl intermediates during hydrolysis, i.e. the hydrolysis of the b(l -> 4) linkages between N- acetylmuramyl and N-acetylglucosaminyl residues of the peptidoglyccan. The reaction includes forming a N-acetyl-l,6-anhydro-muramyl moiety residue during glycosidic cleavage. The EC number of lytic transglycosylase is EC 4.2.2.nl - Peptidoglycan lytic exotransglycosylase with alternative names for lytic transglycosylase like peptidoglycan lytic exotransglycosylase and exomuramidase. Examples of peptidoglycan hydrolases exhibiting the lytic transglycosylase activity are phage lambda endolysin (Taylor and Gorazdowska, 1974) and phage Phi KZ gpl44 endolysin (Paradis-Bleau et al, 2007). Further preferably, a domain having enzymatic activity is the N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase that hydrolyzes the amide bond between the glycan moiety (MurNAc) and the peptide moiety (L-alanine) of the cell wall. The EC number of N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase is EC 3.5.1.28 with alternative names for N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase like amidase, acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidase; N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine amidase; N- acylmuramyl-L-alanine amidase; acetylmuramoyl-alanine amidase; N-acetylmuramic acid L- alanine amidase; acetylmuramyl-alanine amidase; N-acetylmuramylalanine amidase; murein hydrolase; N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase type I; N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase type II. Examples of peptidoglycan hydrolases exhibiting the N-acetylmuramoyl-L- alanine amidase activity are amidase domain of the staphylococcal phage Fl l endolysin (Navarre et al, 1999), LysK (Becker et al, 2009a; Donovan et al, 2009), Listeria phage endolysin Ply511 (Loessner et al, 1995b) and PlyPSA (Korndorfer et al, 2006). Further preferably, a domain having enzymatic activity is the endopeptidase that hydrolyzes peptide bonds between two amino acids. Cleavage may occur in the stem peptide, e.g. Ply500 and Plyl 18 L-alanyl-D-glutamate endolysins (Loessner et al., 1995b) or in the interpeptide bridge, e.g., Fl l D-alanyl-glycyl endolysin (Navarre et al, 1999) or the lysostaphin bacteriocin/exolysin. The EC number of endopeptidase is EC 3.4.25.74 in case of Lysostaphin, and EC 3.4.24 in case of Plyl 18. An alternative name for endopeptidase is metallopeptidase. Examples of peptidoglycan hydrolases exhibiting the endopeptidase activity are. Ply500, Plyl 18, L-alanyl-D-glutamate endolysins (Loessner et al, 1995b), Ply PSA, LysK, Lambda Sail, Fl l D-alanyl-glycyl endolysin (Navarre et al, 1999), B30, lysostaphin. The peptidoglycan degrading activity of a polypeptide having peptidoglycan hydrolase activity on Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria can be measured by assays well known in the art, e.g. by muralytic assays in which the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is permeabilized or removed (e.g. with chloroform) to allow the putative enzyme access to the peptidoglycan layer. If the enzyme is active, degradation of the peptidoglycan layer will lead to a drop of turbidity, which can be measured photometrically (see for example Briers et al., J. Biochem. Biophys Methods 70: 531-533, (2007) or Schmelcher et al, Bacteriophage endolysins as novel antimicrobials. Schmelcher M, Donovan DM, Loessner MJ. Future Microbiol. 2012 Oct;7(10): l 147-7).

Example 1 : Persister killing - Planktonic persister cells were isolated from a stationary phase culture as described e.g. in Chen et al, 2011 (Chen X, Zhang M, Zhou C, Kallenbach NR, Ren D. 2011. Control of bacterial persister cells by Trp/Arg-containing antimicrobial peptides. Appl Environ Microbiol 77:4878-4885.). Briefly, an overnight culture of P. aeruginosa PA14 and PA1255 (a cystic fibrosis isolate) was inoculated each in 50 ml 1 :20 Trypticase Soy Broth (TSB). After 48h of growth at 37°C, the culture was treated with ofloxacin at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml (5xMIC) for 5 hours at 37°C, while shaking at 200 rpm. The persister cells surviving this antibiotic treatment were isolated by centrifugation (5250g, 15 min, 4°C) and the cell pellet was washed twice with 20 mM HEPES buffer. Prior to treatment, cells were resuspended in the same volume of 20 mM HEPES buffer. A persister killing assay was performed as described e.g. by De Groote et al, 2009 (De Groote VN, Verstraeten N, Fauvart M, Kint CI, Verbeeck AM, Beullens S, Cornells P, Michiels J. 2009. Novel persistence genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa identified by high-throughput screening. FEMS Microbiol Lett 297:73-79). Briefly, a volume of 100 μΐ of the isolated persister fraction was mixed with polypeptides comprising peptidoglycan hydrolase or ciprofloxacin (final concentrations of lOx or 30xMIC against the respective strains), in the absence or presence of 0.5 mM EDTA-Na2 (final concentration) up to a final volume of 200 μΐ. Control treatments with 20mM HEPES buffer, 0.5 mM EDTA or ofloxacin (30x and lOx MIC) were performed in parallel. The mixtures were shaken (200 rpm) for lh at 37°C. Treated persisters where washed twice with 20 mM HEPES buffer and appropriate dilutions were plated on TSB agar plates and incubated at 37°C. The number of persisters was determined after 72h incubation to allow complete resuscitation of all surviving persisters. Each experiment was independently repeated at least 3 times. Example 2: Materials and methods for examples 3 to 6 Isolation of persister fraction Planktonic persister ceils were isolated from, a stationary-phase culture as described previously ( Lichens V, Defraine V, Van der Lcyden A, De Groote VN, Fierro C, Beullens S, Verstraeten N, Kint C, Jans A, Frangipani E, Visa P, Marchal. K. Versees W, Fauvart M, Michicls J. 2014. A putative de-N-acetylase of the PIG-L superfamily affects fluoroquinolone tolerance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Pathogen. Dis. 71 :39-54.) with minor modifications. An overnight culture of .P. aeruginosa PA14, PA1255 (a cystic fibrosis isolate), Escherichia colt UTI-89 (isolate from, chronic urinary tract infection) and Acinetobacter baumannii RUN 1 4 (reference strain for global, clone 2) was diluted 100 x in 50 ml. 1 :20 Trypticase soy broth (TSB). After overnight growth at 37°C, the cultures were treated with either 10 tLig/ml. ofloxacin (/'. aeruginosa strains), 200 >ug/ml tobramycin. (A. baumannii) or 200 μg/ml amikacin (E. coli) for 5h at 37°C, while shaking at 200 rpm.. The antibiotic concentrations were chosen, to allow only persister cells to survive, based on previous time-kill curves. The persister fractions were isolated by centrifugation (5,250 x g for 15 min at 4°C), and the cell. pellet was washed twice with. 20 mM. HEPES (pH 7.4). Prior to treatment, the cells were resuspended in a ten-fold reduced volume of 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) to concentrate the persisters. Persister killing assay A persister killing assay was performed as described previously (Liebens et al, 2014), with, minor modifications. A volume of 100 μΐ of the isolated persister fraction was mixed with either the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 124, 125, 126 or ciprofloxacin (final concentrations of lOx or 30xMIC against the respective strains), i the absence or presence of 0.5 mM EDTA-Na2 (final, concentration) up to a final, volume of 200 μΐ. Control treatments with 20 m.M HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.5 mM EDTA, or ofloxacin/tobramycin/amikacin ( Ox and lOxMIC) were performed in parallel. The mixtures were shaken (200 rpm) for lh at 37°C. The treated persister cells were washed twice with 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), and the appropriate dilutions were plated on TSB plates and incubated at 37°C. The number of persisters was determined after 72 h of incubation to allow for complete resuscitation of all surviving persisters. Example 3: The bactericidal activity of the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 126 was tested against isolated persister fractions of P. aeruginosa strains. Persister fractions of two different strains (PA14 and PA1255, an isolate of a cystic fibrosis patient) were collected after 5h exposure to 5X MIC ofloxacin. The lack of killing after further exposure of the isolated fractions to increased ofloxacin concentrations (lOx and 30xMIC) confirmed the persistent (antibiotic- tolerant) nature of both isolated persister fractions. The persisters were incubated with different concentrations of the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 126 or ciprofloxacin ( 1 O M IC and 30xMIC) in the absence or presence of 0.5 mM EDTA. The polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 126 ( 1 Ox and 30xMIC) completely eradicated the remaining persisters in the presence of 0.5 mM EDTA, whereas similar doses of ciprofloxacin (with and without EDTA) or 0.5 mM EDTA alone did not affect the persisters. In the absence of EDTA, a 30xMIC dose of the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 126 reduced the persister fractions of PA 14 and PA 1255 severely. In summary, the overall activity of the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 126 against these persister fractions is extremely pronounced. Example 4: The killing activity of the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 126 (30xMIC) was evaluated against A. baumannii RUH persisters. Those were isolated after a 5h treatment with tobramycin. Aside of the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 126, also the effect of the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 125 (30xMIC) was evaluated. Ciprofloxacin (30xMIC) was used as a control antibiotic. Both polypeptides, i.e. the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 126 as well as the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 125, and ciprofloxacin were tested in the absence and presence of 0.5 m.M EDTA. Tobramycin (30xMIC) and 0.5 m.M EDTA were added as a control. The polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 126 (30xMIC) reduced the number of persisters with approximately 1.75 log units, whereas the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 126 (30xMIC) with 0.5 mM EDTA resulted in a complete eradication (>2.5 log in comparison to 0.5 mM EDTA/Tobramycin control). Whereas the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 125 (30xMIC) alone did not strongly affect persisters, a strong reduction (approximately 1.8 log in comparison to the 0.5 mM EDTA/Tobramycin control) is observed in the presence of 0.5 mM EDTA. Example 5: The killing effect of the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 124 (comprising a fusion of Sarcotoxin I A (SEQ ID NO: 48) and Z144 (SEQ ID NO: 11), active against vegetative cells of Λ'. coli) was analyzed against the isolated persister fraction of E. coli. An isolate of a chronic urinary tract infection was used to isolate the persister fraction upon 5h amikacin exposure. A final concentration corresponding to l OxMIC was used, both in the absence or the presence of 0.5 mM EDTA. 0.5 mM EDTA was included as control. Ciprofloxacin ( 1 Ox MIC) was tested as comparison antibiotic. The isolated persister fraction (approximately 102 persisters/mi) was significantly smaller in comparison to P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii persister fractions. The control antibiotic ciprofloxacin (lOxMIC) (with and without EDTA) and the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 124 (lOxMIC) without 0.5 mM EDTA did not completely kill persisters. However, combination of the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 124 (lOxMIC) with 0.5 mM EDTA completely eradicated the persisters. Example 6: The anti-persister effect of the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 124 was evaluated against persisters isolated from P. aeruginosa PA14 upon exposure to ofloxacin. The persisters were treated with the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 124 with a final, concentration equivalent to 30xMIC against /'. aeruginosa PA14, both in the absence and the presence of 0.5 mM EDTA. 0.5 mM EDTA and ofloxacin (30xMIC) were included as a control. Ciprofloxacin was included as comparison antibiotic. In comparison to the 0.5 mM EDTA control, the polypeptide according to SEQ ID NO: 124 (30xMIC) reduced the number of persisters with approximately 2.3 log units.
