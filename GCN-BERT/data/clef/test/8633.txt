Example Compound 51
2-((3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)amino)-2-oxoethyl 2-(2-iodophenyl)acetate
2-(2-iodophenyl)acetic acid (25.9 mg, 0.1 mmol) was dissolved in dry DCM (2 mL), cooled to 0 Â°C and added DCC (20.2 mg, 0.1 mmol) and DMAP (2.8 mg, 0.02 mmol) followed by N-(3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1 H-pyrazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyacetamide (24.0 mg, 0.1 mmol), synthesized as reported in Example 1. The obtained suspension was filtered over cotton to remove the bulk of DCU and purified by column chromatography (75% EtOAc in PE) to yield 44 mg of the title compound (92%).
