FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion comprising a polyurethane resin dispersed in an aqueous medium. Further, the present invention relates to a coating composition and a paint composition, each comprising the aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion, and a polyurethane resin film produced from a composition comprising the polyurethane resin dispersion. BACKGROUND ART Polycarbonate polyol is a useful compound as a raw material for producing a polyurethane resin by using a reaction with an isocyanate compound, wherein the polyurethane resin is used for, for example, a rigid foam, a flexible foam, a coating composition, a bonding agent, synthetic leather, and an ink binder. Further, it has been known that a coating film obtained by applying an aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion using polycarbonate polyol as a raw material has excellent light resistance, excellent heat resistance, excellent hydrolytic resistance, and excellent oil resistance (see patent document 1). As an aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion which forms a film having high flexibility, a composition having a crosslinked structure introduced into a polyether polyurethane resin using a polyamine compound having three or more amino groups in total has been reported (see patent document 2). Further, an aqueous polyether polyurethane resin comprising an aliphatic hydrocarbon compound having one carboxyl group and one hydroxyl group has been reported (see patent document 3). PRIOR ART REFERENCES Patent Documents Patent document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei 10-120757 Patent document 2: Japanese Patent Application prior-to-examination Publication (kohyo) No. 2001-521953 Patent document 3: Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2004-231813 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION Problems to be Solved by the Invention However, the aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion using polycarbonate polyol as a raw material described in patent document 1 is disadvantageous in that the dispersibility of the polyurethane resin in water is poor due to high cohesive force of the polycarbonate polyol, making it difficult to obtain an aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion having high storage stability. Further, the aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion has a problem in that a film obtained after drying the dispersion has poor flexibility. For this reason, when used for various coatings and bonding agents, for example, a coating composition on metal, an overcoat agent on various plastics (films), a coating composition on woodworking, and a printing ink, the aqueous dispersion cannot exhibit satisfactory "urethane-like flexibility". The polyether polyurethane resin described in patent document 2 exhibits flexibility by virtue of the polyether chain which is a soft segment and has a problem of poor light resistance which is characteristic of the polyether. To solve the problem, an attempt has been made to produce an aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion using polycarbonate polyol instead of the polyether polyol which is a raw material for the polyether polyurethane resin. However, it has been found that the obtained aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion has a problem in that the flexibility is unsatisfactory (or the elastic modulus is high). The aqueous polyether polyurethane resin described in patent document 3 has a problem of poor light resistance which is characteristic of the polyether. To solve the problem, an attempt has been made to produce an aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion using polycarbonate polyol instead of the polyether polyol which is a raw material for the aqueous polyether polyurethane resin. However, it has been found that the obtained aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion has problems in that the storage stability is poor, and in that the resultant aqueous polyurethane resin has an unsatisfactory molecular weight, so that a polyurethane film having a satisfactory strength cannot be obtained. A task of the present invention is to obtain an aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion which is advantageous not only in that the dispersion exhibits excellent storage stability in an aqueous medium, but also in that when the dispersion is applied onto a substrate and dried, a polyurethane film having a low elastic modulus can be obtained. Means to Solve the Problems The present inventors have made various studies with a view toward solving the above-mentioned problems and providing an aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion which is advantageous not only in that the dispersion exhibits excellent storage stability in an aqueous medium, but also in that after the dispersion is dried, a film having satisfactory flexibility is formed. As a result, it has been found that an aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion comprising a polyurethane resin dispersed in an aqueous medium is effective, wherein the polyurethane resin is obtained by reacting (A) a polyurethane prepolymer with (B) a chain extender, wherein the polyurethane prepolymer (A) is obtained by reacting (a) a polycarbonate polyol compound, (b) a polyisocyanate compound, (c) an acid group-containing polyol compound, and (d) a compound having one acid group and one hydroxyl group, wherein the chain extender (B) contains (B-1) a polyamine compound having three or more amino group(s) and/or imino group(s) in total, and the present invention has been completed.

Polyurethane prepolymer (A) may contain additional polyol (a-2) and/or chain terminating agent (d-2). In obtaining polyurethane prepolymer (A), when the total amount of polycarbonate polyol compound (a), polyisocyanate compound (b), acid group-containing polyol compound (c), compound (d) having one acid group and one hydroxyl group, and chain extender (B), and optionally chain terminating agent (d-2) and additional polyol (a-2) is 100 parts by weight, the amount of polycarbonate polyol compound (a) is preferably 40 to 90 parts by weight, more preferably 50 to 85 parts by weight, further preferably 60 to 80 parts by weight. The amount of acid group-containing polyol compound (c) is preferably 0.5 to 10 parts by weight, more preferably 1 to 5 parts by weight. The amount of additional polyol (a-2) is preferably 0 to 20 parts by weight, more preferably 0 to 10 parts by weight, further preferably 0 to 5 parts by weight. When the amount of polycarbonate polyol compound (a) is 40 parts by weight or more, the obtained polyurethane film has an appropriately lowered elastic modulus, and, when the amount of polycarbonate polyol compound (a) is 90 parts by weight or less, the aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion has improved storage stability. When the amount of acid group-containing polyol compound (c) is 0.5 part by weight or more, the obtained aqueous polyurethane resin has excellent dispersibility in an aqueous medium, and, when the amount of acid group-containing polyol compound (c) is 10 parts by weight or less, a coating film obtained by applying the obtained aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion has excellent water resistance, and further the obtained film has improved flexibility. When the amount of additional polyol (a-2) is too large, the obtained polyurethane resin film may become poor in weathering resistance, light resistance, hydrolytic resistance, or chemical resistance. In obtaining polyurethane prepolymer (A), the ratio of the mole of isocyanate groups of polyisocyanate compound (b) to the total mole of hydroxyl groups of the all polyol components comprising polycarbonate polyol compound (a), acid group-containing polyol compound (c), compound (d) having one acid group and one hydroxyl group, and optionally additional polyol (a-2) is preferably 1.05 to 2.5. When the ratio of the mole of isocyanate groups of polyisocyanate compound (b) to the total mole of hydroxyl groups of the all polyol components is 2.5 or less, polyurethane prepolymer (A) having no isocyanate group at the molecular end thereof is reduced, namely, the molecules which are not reacted with chain extender (B) are reduced, so that a film can be appropriately obtained after drying the aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion of the present invention. On the other hand, when the ratio of the mole of isocyanate groups of polyisocyanate compound (b) to the total mole of hydroxyl groups of the all polyol components is 1.05 or more, it is unlikely that the unreacted polyisocyanate compound (b) in a large amount remains in the reaction system, and hence it is unlikely that such an unreacted compound is reacted with chain extender (B) or water to cause chain extension of the molecules, so that the aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion of the present invention can be produced with ease and improved the storage stability. Further, the obtained polyurethane film has an appropriately lowered elastic modulus. The ratio of the mole of isocyanate groups of polyisocyanate compound (b) to the total mole of hydroxyl groups of the all polyol components is more preferably 1.1 to 1.8, further preferably 1.2 to 1.6. When polycarbonate polyol compound (a), acid group-containing polyol compound (c), polyisocyanate compound (b), and compound (d) having one acid group and one hydroxyl group are reacted with each other to obtain polyurethane prepolymer (A), (a), (c), and (d) may be reacted with (b) in any order. In the reaction for obtaining polyurethane prepolymer (A), a catalyst can be used. With respect to examples of the catalysts, there is no particular limitation, but examples include salts of a metal and an organic or inorganic acid, and organometal derivatives, e.g., tin catalysts (such as trimethyltin laurate and dibutyltin dilaurate) and lead catalysts (such as lead octylate), amine catalysts (such as triethylamine, N-ethylmorpholine, and triethylenediamine), and diazabicycloundecene catalysts. Of these, from the viewpoint of the reactivity, dibutyltin dilaurate is preferred. With respect to the reaction temperature for the reaction of the polyol components with the polyisocyanate, there is no particular limitation, but the reaction temperature is preferably 40 to 150°C. When the reaction temperature is too low, it is likely that the raw materials are not dissolved, so that the viscosity of the obtained polyurethane prepolymer (A) is too high to stir the prepolymer satisfactorily. When the reaction temperature is too high, for example, a problem of a side reaction may occur. The reaction temperature is further preferably 60 to 120°C. The reaction of polycarbonate polyols compound (a), acid group-containing polyol compound (c), polyisocyanate compound (b), and compound (d) having one acid group and one hydroxyl group may be conducted either without a solvent or in an organic solvent added. Examples of organic solvents include acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, N-methylpyrrolidone, N-ethylpyrrolidone, and ethyl acetate. Of these, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and ethyl acetate are preferred because they can be removed by heating under a reduced pressure after dispersing the polyurethane prepolymer in water and performing the chain extension reaction. Further, N-methylpyrrolidone and N-ethylpyrrolidone are preferred because they serve as a film-forming aid in forming a coating film from the obtained aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion. The amount of the added organic solvent, in terms of a weight, is preferably 0.1 to 2.0 times, more preferably 0.15 to 0.8 time as large as the total weight of polycarbonate polyol compound (a), acid group-containing polyol compound (c), polyisocyanate compound (b), and compound (d) having one acid group and one hydroxyl group. In the present invention, polyurethane prepolymer (A) preferably has an acid value (AV) of 8 to 30 mg KOH/g, more preferably 10 to 22 mg KOH/g, further preferably 14 to 19 mg KOH/g. When the acid value of polyurethane prepolymer (A) is 8 mg KOH/g or more, the dispersibility in an aqueous medium is excellent. On the other hand, when the acid value of polyurethane prepolymer (A) is 30 mg KOH/g or less, the obtained polyurethane resin coating film has improved water resistance, and further the obtained film has improved flexibility. In the present invention, the term "acid value of polyurethane prepolymer (A)" means an acid value of so-called solids of the polyurethane prepolymer, which are obtained by removing the solvent used in producing polyurethane prepolymer (A) and the neutralizing agent used for dispersing polyurethane prepolymer (A) in the aqueous medium. Specifically, the acid value of polyurethane prepolymer (A) can be introduced by the following formula (3). Acid value of polyurethane prepolymerAmg KOH/g=Millimole of acid group-containing polyol compoundb+Millimole ofcompounddhaving one acid group and one hydroxyl group×56.11/Total weight of polycarbonate polyol compounda,acid group-containing polyol compoundc,polyisocyanate compoundb,and compounddhaving one acid group and one hydroxyl group (Polyurethane resin) In the present invention, the polyurethane resin may be obtained by a one-shot process in which polycarbonate polyol compound (a), acid group-containing polyol compound (c), polyisocyanate compound (b), compound (d) having one acid group and one hydroxyl group, and chain extender (B) are reacted at the same time. Alternative, the polyurethane resin may be obtained by a prepolymer method in which polycarbonate polyol compound (a), acid group-containing polyol compound (c), polyisocyanate compound (b), and compound (d) having one acid group and one hydroxyl group are reacted to prepare polyurethane prepolymer (A), and the prepared polyurethane prepolymer (A) and chain extender (B) are reacted with each other. When polyurethane prepolymer (A) and chain extender (B) are reacted with each other to obtain a polyurethane resin, the temperature for the reaction of polyurethane prepolymer (A) and chain extender (B) is, for example, 0 to 80°C, preferably 0 to 60°C. (Aqueous medium) In the present invention, the polyurethane resin is dispersed in an aqueous medium. Examples of the aqueous media include water, and a mixed medium of water and a hydrophilic organic solvent. As examples of the water, there can be mentioned tap water, ion-exchanged water, distilled water, and ultrapure water. Of these, taking into consideration, for example, easy availability and unstable particles caused due to the influence of salts, ion-exchanged water is preferably used. Examples of the hydrophilic organic solvents include lower monohydric alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, and propanol; polyhydric alcohols, such as ethylene glycol and glycerol; and aprotic hydrophilic organic solvents, such as N-methylmorpholine, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, and N-ethylpyrrolidone. The amount of the hydrophilic organic solvent in the aqueous medium is preferably 0 to 20% by weight.

Step (α) for obtaining polyurethane prepolymer (A) may be performed either in an atmosphere of inert gas or in an atmosphere of air. Preferred conditions for step (α) are substantially the same as those for the above-mentioned method for obtaining polyurethane prepolymer (A), and the descriptions of the same conditions are omitted. As examples of neutralizing agents which can be used in step (β) of neutralizing the acid group of polyurethane prepolymer (A), there can be mentioned organic amines, such as trimethylamine, triethylamine, triisopropylamine, tributylamine, triethanolamine, N-methyldiethanolamine, N-ethyldiethanolamine, N-phenyldiethanolamine, dimethylethanolamine, diethylethanolamine, N-methylmorpholine, and pyridine; inorganic alkali salts, such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide; and ammonia.

In step (γ) of dispersing polyurethane prepolymer (A) in an aqueous medium, with respect to the method for dispersing the polyurethane prepolymer in an aqueous medium, there is no particular limitation, but, for example, there can be mentioned a method in which polyurethane prepolymer (A) is added to an aqueous medium being stirred by, e.g., a homomixer or a homogenizer, and a method in which an aqueous medium is added to polyurethane prepolymer (A) being stirred by, e.g., a homomixer or a homogenizer. In step (δ) of reacting polyurethane prepolymer (A) with chain extender (B) having reactivity with the isocyanate group of polyurethane prepolymer (A), step (δ) may be performed slowly while cooling, or may be performed under heating conditions at 60°C or lower so as to promote the reaction. The reaction time for the reaction conducted while cooling is about 0.5 to 24 hours, and the reaction time for the reaction conducted under heating conditions at 60°C or lower is about 0.1 to 6 hours.

The weight average molecular weight is measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and a value determined by conversion from a calibration curve preliminarily prepared with the standard polystyrene can be used. When the weight average molecular weight is smaller than the above range, a film may not be obtained by drying the aqueous urethane resin dispersion. When the weight average molecular weight is larger than the above range, the aqueous urethane resin dispersion may become poor in the drying properties. In the aqueous polyurethane resin dispersion of the present invention, if necessary, an additive, such as a thickener, a photosensitizer, a curing catalyst, an ultraviolet light absorber, a light stabilizer, an anti-foaming agent, a plasticizer, a surface conditioner, or an anti-settling agent, can be added.

In the tables, the number of the amount (weight ratio) of the individual raw materials has been basically rounded off to the nearest whole digit, and therefore the sum of the amounts of all the raw materials of the urethane resin is not always 100. The aqueous polyurethane resin dispersions obtained in Comparative Examples 1, 2, 4, and 7 had so poor storage stability that a weight average molecular weight and an elastic modulus of each film could not be measured.
