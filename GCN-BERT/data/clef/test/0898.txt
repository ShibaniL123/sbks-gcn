3-(3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propyl)-1-methylpteridine-2,4-dione
Step 1
3-(3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propyl)-1-methylpteridine-2,4-dione
3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propyl methanesulfonate (185 mg, 0.729 mmol), 1-methylpteridine-2,4-dione (100 mg, 0.561 mmol) and potassium carbonate (233 mg, 1.68 mmol) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (5 mL), potassium iodide (9.3 mg, 0.0561 mmol) was added. The reaction was allowed to heat to 120Â°C and stirred for 3 hours, cooled to room temperature, filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by preparative HPLC to give 3-(3-(1H-indol-3-yl)propyl)-1-methylpteridine-2,4-dione (10.0 mg) with a yield of 5%.
