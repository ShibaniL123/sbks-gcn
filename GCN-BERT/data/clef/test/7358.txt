Example 43
4-{[(6-Bromo-3-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}cubane-1-carboxylic acid
93.4 mg (0.17 mmol, purity 91%) of the compound from Example 83A were dissolved in 4.9 ml of a THF/methanol mixture (5:1), 0.84 ml (0.84 mmol) of a 1 M lithium hydroxide solution was added and the mixture was stirred at 50Â° C. for 1 h. After cooling to RT, the mixture was adjusted to pH 1-2 by addition of 4 M hydrochloric acid and purified by preparative HPLC (Method 2). The solid obtained was stirred in boiling water for 3 h, filtered whilst hot and dried under reduced pressure. This gave 52 mg (63% of theory, purity 99%) of the title compound
