HIGH HEAT POLYCARBONATE COMPOSITIONS CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/979,864, filed April 15, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. TECHNICAL FIELD [0002] The present disclosure relates generally to polycarbonate compositions, methods of using the compositions, and processes for preparing the compositions. In particular, the disclosure relates to polycarbonate compositions having improved thermal, mechanical, or rheological properties. The disclosure also relates to articles comprising the polycarbonate compositions, and more particularly, metallizable articles formed from the compositions. BACKGROUND [0003] Polycarbonates (PC) are synthetic thermoplastic resins that can be derived from bisphenols and phosgenes by interfacial polymerization, or from bisphenols and diaryl carbonates by melt polymerization. Polycarbonates are a useful class of polymers having many desired properties. They are highly regarded for optical clarity and enhanced impact strength and ductility at room temperature. [0004] Since part designs are becoming more and more complex, a need remains for materials that have an improved balance of properties (e.g., heat resistance, melt flow, impact resistance, and metallizability). In particular, there remains a need for improved polycarbonate compositions, and articles formed from such compositions. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0005] FIG. 1 depicts an exemplary auto bezel that can be molded from a disclosed polycarbonate blend composition. The bezel can be metallized after the molding process. DETAILED DESCRIPTION [0006] The present disclosure relates to polycarbonate-based blend compositions, also referred to herein as thermoplastic compositions. The compositions include at least one high heat polycarbonate. The compositions can include one or more additional polymers (e.g., homopolycarbonates, polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymers, polyesters). The compositions can include one or more additives (e.g., fillers, mold release agents, antioxidants). The compositions can have improved thermal properties, mechanical properties, or rheological properties. [0007] The compositions can be used to manufacture a variety of articles, and in particular, metallized articles suited to high heat applications. For example, the compositions can be used to prepare metallized headlamp bezels. Automotive headlamps are increasingly utilizing light sources that operate at higher temperatures and generate greater heat loads than in the past. Headlamps are also becoming a more integral part of automobile design to improve aerodynamics and aesthetic appearance. The result is that headlamp components (e.g., the lens) are closer to the light (and heat) source, necessitating use of materials that have an increased heat resistance while retaining other material characteristics. [0008] The thermoplastic compositions are preferably directly metallizable for use in manufacture of metallized articles (e.g., metallized bezels). Additional preparation steps, such as base coating or chemical etching, can reduce the gloss of the metallized part. Thermoplastics can be evaluated for metallizability by assessing initial appearance after metallization, cross-hatch adhesion, haze onset temperature, and corrosion resistance, for example. [0009] The terms "comprise(s)," "include(s)," "having," "has," "can," "contain(s)," and variants thereof, as used herein, are intended to be open-ended transitional phrases, terms, or words that do not preclude the possibility of additional acts or structures. The singular forms "a," "an" and "the" include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The present disclosure also contemplates other embodiments "comprising," "consisting of and "consisting essentially of," the embodiments or elements presented herein, whether explicitly set forth or not. [0010] The conjunctive term "or" includes any and all combinations of one or more listed elements associated by the conjunctive term. For example, the phrase "an apparatus comprising A or B" may refer to an apparatus including A where B is not present, an apparatus including B where A is not present, or an apparatus where both A and B are present. The phrases "at least one of A, B, . . . and N" or "at least one of A, B, . . . N, or combinations thereof are defined in the broadest sense to mean one or more elements selected from the group comprising A, B, . . . and N, that is to say, any combination of one or more of the elements A, B, . . . or N including any one element alone or in combination with one or more of the other elements which may also include, in combination, additional elements not listed. [0011] The terms "first," "second," "third," and the like, as used herein, do not denote any order, quantity, or importance, but rather are used to distinguish one element from another. [0012] For the recitation of numeric ranges herein, each intervening number there between with the same degree of precision is explicitly contemplated. For example, for the range of 6-9, the numbers 7 and 8 are contemplated in addition to 6 and 9, and for the range 6.0-7.0, the number 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9, and 7.0 are explicitly contemplated. [0013] Disclosed are polycarbonate-based blend compositions. The compositions include at least one high heat polycarbonate, which may be referred to herein as "the first polycarbonate." The compositions may include one or more additional polycarbonates, which may be referred to herein as "the second polycarbonate," "the third polycarbonate," and the like. The compositions may include one or more polyesters, which may be referred to herein as "the first polyester," "the second polyester," and the like. The compositions may include one or more hydroxyl-functionalized flow promoters (e.g., alkylene glycols). The compositions may include one or more additives. [0014] The compositions include at least one polycarbonate. Polycarbonates of the disclosed blend compositions may be homopolycarbonates, copolymers comprising different moieties in the carbonate (referred to as "copolycarbonates"), copolymers comprising carbonate units and other types of polymer units such as polysiloxane units, polyester units, and combinations thereof.

In another example, the cyclohexylidene-bridged bisphenol may be the reaction product of two moles of a cresol with one mole of a hydrogenated isophorone (e.g., l,l,3-trimethyl-3-cyclohexane-5-one). Such cyclohexane-containing bisphenols, for example the reaction product of two moles of a phenol with one mole of a hydrogenated isophorone, are useful for making polycarbonate polymers with high glass transition temperatures and high heat distortion temperatures. Cyclohexyl bisphenol-containing polycarbonates, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing with other bisphenol polycarbonates, are supplied by Bayer Co. under the APEC® trade name. [0028] The dihydroxy compound of formula (17) can have formula (18), which may be useful for high heat applicatio (also known as l,l-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methylphenyl)cyclohexane (DMBPC)). [0029] The dihydroxy compound of formula (17) can have formula (19), which may be useful for high heat applicatio (also known as bisphenol isophorone).

It will be understood that where the fused ring is aromatic, the ring as shown in formula (21) will have an unsaturated carbon-carbon linkage where the ring is fused. When i is 0, h is 0, and k is 1, the ring as shown in formula (21) contains 4 carbon atoms; when i is 0, h is 0, and k is 2, the ring as shown contains 5 carbon atoms, and when i is 0, h is 0, and k is 3, the ring contains 6 carbon atoms. In one example, two adjacent groups (e.g., Rq and R1 taken together) form an aromatic group, and in another embodiment, Rq and R1 taken together form one aromatic group and Rr and Rp taken together form a second aromatic group. When Rq and R1 taken together form an aromatic group, Rp can be a double-bonded oxygen atom, i.e., a ketone.

[0043] The polysiloxane blocks comprise repeating siloxane units of formula (32): wherein each R is independently a C1-C13 monovalent organic group. For example, R can be a C1-C13 alkyl, C1-C13 alkoxy, C2-C13 alkenyl, C2-C13 alkenyloxy, C3-C6 cycloalkyl, C3-C6 cycloalkoxy, C6-Ci4 aryl, C6-Cio aryloxy, C7-C13 arylalkyl, C7-C13 aralkoxy, C7-C13 alkylaryl, or C7-C13 alkylaryloxy. The foregoing groups can be fully or partially halogenated with fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine, or a combination thereof. Where a transparent poly(carbonate-siloxane) is desired, R is unsubstituted by halogen. Combinations of the foregoing R groups can be used in the same copolymer. [0044] The value of E in formula (32) can vary widely depending on the type and relative amount of each component in the composition, the desired properties of the composition, and like considerations. Generally, E has an average value of 2 to 1,000, specifically 2 to 500, 2 to 200, or 2 to 125, 5 to 80, or 10 to 70. E may have an average value of 10 to 80, 10 to 40, 40 to 80, or 40 to 70. Where E is of a lower value (e.g., less than 40), it can be desirable to use a relatively larger amount of the poly(carbonate-siloxane).

[0090] The polyesters can be obtained by interfacial polymerization or melt-process condensation, by solution phase condensation, or by transesterification polymerization wherein, for example, a dialkyl ester such as dimethyl terephthalate can be transesterified with ethylene glycol using acid catalysis, to generate poly(ethylene terephthalate). It is possible to use a branched polyester in which a branching agent, for example, a glycol having three or more hydroxyl groups or a trifunctional or multifunctional carboxylic acid has been incorporated. Furthermore, it is sometimes desirable to have various concentrations of acid and hydroxyl end groups on the polyester, depending on the ultimate end use of the composition.

In certain embodiments, formula (63) includes at least three hydroxymethyl groups, or at least two hydroxymethyl groups and one amino group. [0096] Exemplary compounds of formula (63) include, but are not limited to, 1,1- dimethylol-l-aminoethane (DAE), 1,1-dimethylol-l-aminopropane (DAP), tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (THAM), 1,1,1-trimethylolpropane (TMP), 1,1,1- trimethylolethane, pentaerythritol (PETOL), dipentaerythritol, tripentaerythritol, 1,1,1- trimethylol pentane, or any combination thereof.

[0098] In certain embodiments, the hydroxyl-functionalized flow promoter is a hydroxyl- functionalized aromatic compound. The hydroxyl-functionalized aromatic compound can be a mono-aryl (e.g., 1,4-di hydroxybenzene, or 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane), a bis-aryl (e.g., BPA), or a hydroxyl functionalized oligo or poly-aryl moiety.

[00101] The hydroxyl-functionalized flow promoters can be present in the compositions in an amount of 0.01 to 2% by weight, and preferably 0.05 to 1% based on total weight of the composition. [00102] The compositions may comprise additional components, such as one or more additives. Suitable additives include, but are not limited to impact modifiers, UV stabilizers, colorants, flame retardants, heat stabilizers, plasticizers, lubricants, mold release agents, fillers, reinforcing agents, antioxidant agents, antistatic agents, blowing agents, anti-drip agents, and radiation stabilizers. [00103] The blend compositions may have a combination of desired properties. [00104] Melt viscosity (MV) of the blend compositions may be determined using ISO 11443 or ASTM D3835. Melt viscosity is a measurement of the rheological characteristics of a composition at temperatures and shear conditions common to processing equipment. A lower value for melt viscosity indicates that the composition flows easier. Melt viscosity may be determined at different temperatures (e.g., 260 °C, 280 °C, 300 °C, 316 °C, or 330 °C) and different shear rates (e.g., 1500 or 5000 second-1). Melt viscosities are typically determined by pressing a molten composition through a die while measuring the pressure drop over the complete or part of the die. Melt viscosities may be measured by, for example, a Kayeness Capillary viscometer (e.g., with a capillary length: diameter ratio of 20:1, a capillary diameter of 1.0 millimeter, a capillary entrance angle of 180 degrees, and a dwell time of 4 minutes). Melt viscosity may be reported in Pascal-seconds and the shear rate may be reported in reciprocal seconds. A melt viscosity measured at a shear rate of 5000 s"1 may be referred to as a high shear melt viscosity value. [00105] The blend compositions may have a melt viscosity of 50 MPa to 400 MPa, 50 MPa to 375 MPa, 50 MPa to 350 MPa, 50 MPa to 325 MPa, 50 MPa to 300 MPa, 50 MPa to 275 MPa, 50 MPa to 250 MPa, 50 MPa to 225 MPa, 50 MPa to 200 MPa, 50 MPa to 175 MPa, 50 MPa to 150 MPa, 100 MPa to 375 MPa, 100 MPa to 350 MPa, 100 MPa to 325 MPa, 100 MPa to 300 MPa, 100 MPa to 275 MPa, 100 MPa to 250 MPa, 100 MPa to 225 MPa, or 100 MPa to 200 MPa, measured in accordance with ISO 11443 at 300 °C at a shear rate of 1500 s"1, or measured in accordance with ISO 11443 at 316 °C at a shear rate of 5000 s"1. [00106] Melt volume flow rate (often abbreviated MVR) of the blend compositions may be determined using ISO 1133 or ASTM D1238. MVR measures the volume of a composition extruded through an orifice at a prescribed temperature and load over a prescribed time period. The higher the MVR value of a polymer composition at a specific temperature, the greater the flow of that composition at that specific temperature. [00107] MVR may be measured, for example, by packing a small amount of polymer composition into an extruder barrel of an extruder. The composition may be preheated for a specified amount of time at a particular temperature (the test temperature is usually set at or slightly above the melting region of the material being characterized). After preheating the composition, a particular weight (e.g., a 2.16 kg weight) may be introduced to a piston, which acts as the medium that causes extrusion of the molten polymer composition. The weight exerts a force on the piston and thereby the molten polymer composition, and the molten composition flows through the dye wherein the displacement of the molten composition is measured in cubic centimeters per over time such as 10 minutes (cm /10 min). [00108] The compositions may have a MVR of 2 to 300 cm3/10 min, 2 to 200 cm3/10 min, 2 to 100 cm3/10 min, 10 to 300 cm3/10 min, 20 to 300 cm3/10 min, 30 to 300 cm3/10 min, 40 to 300 cm3/10 min, 50 to 300 cm3/10 min, 60 to 300 cm3/10 min, 70 to 300 cm3/10 min, 80 to 300 cm3/10 min, 90 to 300 cm3/10 min, 100 to 300 cm3/10 min, 50 to 200 cm3/10 min, 75 to 175 cm3/10 min, or 100 to 150 cm3/10 min, using the ISO 1133 method, 2.16 kg load, 330 °C temperature, 360 second dwell. [00109] Melt flow rate (often abbreviated MFR) of the blend compositions may be determined using ISO 1133 or ASTM D1238. MFR measures the mass of a composition extruded through an orifice at a prescribed temperature and load over a prescribed time period. The higher the MFR value of a polymer composition at a specific temperature, the greater the flow of that composition at that specific temperature. [00110] The compositions may have a MFR of 2 to 500 g/10 min, 2 to 300 g/10 min, 2 to 200 g/10 min, 2 to 100 g/10 min, 10 to 500 g/10 min, 20 to 500 g/10 min, 30 to 500 g/10 min, 40 to 500 g/10 min, 50 to 500 g/10 min, 60 to 500 g/10 min, 70 to 500 g/10 min, 80 to 500 g/10 min, 90 to 500 g/10 min, 100 to 500 g/10 min, 50 to 300 g/10 min, 75 to 250 g/10 min, or 100 to 200 g/10 min, using the ISO 1133 method, 2.16 kg load, 330 °C temperature, 360 second dwell. [00111] Glass transition temperature (Tg) of the blended compositions may be determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), for example, with a heating rate of 10 °C/minute and using the second heating curve for Tg determination. [00112] The compositions may have glass transition temperatures ranging from 120 °C to 230 °C, 140 °C to 185 °C, 145 °C to 180 °C, 150 °C to 175 °C, 155 °C to 170 °C, or 160 °C to 165 °C. The compositions may have a glass transition temperature of 150 °C, 151 °C, 152 °C, 153 °C, 154 °C, 155 °C, 156 °C, 157 °C, 158 °C, 159 °C, 160 °C, 161 °C, 162 °C, 163 °C, 164 °C, 165 °C, 166 °C, 167 °C, 168 °C, 169 °C, 170 °C, 171 °C, 172 °C, 173 °C, 174 °C, or 175 °C. [00113] Heat deflection temperature or heat distortion temperature (often abbreviated HDT) of the blended compositions may be determined according to ISO 75 or ASTM D648. HDT is a measure of heat resistance and is an indicator of the ability of a material to withstand deformation from heat over time. A higher HDT value indicates better heat resistance. Measurements may be performed on molded ISO bars (80x10x4 mm) preconditioned at 23 °C and 50% relative humidity for 48 hrs. The heating medium of the HDT equipment may be mineral oil. Measurements may be performed in duplicate and the average value reported. [00114] The compositions may have heat deflection temperatures ranging from 120 °C to 230 °C, 140 °C to 185 °C, 145 °C to 180 °C, 150 °C to 175 °C, 155 °C to 170 °C, or 160 °C to 165 °C, measured at 0.45 MPa stress or 1.8 MPa stress in accordance with ISO 75. The compositions may have a heat deflection temperature of 150 °C, 151 °C, 152 °C, 153 °C, 154 °C, 155 °C, 156 °C, 157 °C, 158 °C, 159 °C, 160 °C, 161 °C, 162 °C, 163 °C, 164 °C, 165 °C, 166 °C, 167 °C, 168 °C, 169 °C, 170 °C, 171 °C, 172 °C, 173 °C, 174 °C, or 175 °C, measured at 0.45 MPa stress or 1.8 MPa stress in accordance with ISO 75. [00115] Vicat softening temperature may be determined according to ISO 306. Vicat softening temperature is a measure of the temperature at which a thermoplastic material starts to soften rapidly. Measurements may be performed using a heating rate of 120 °C/hour and a force of 50 Newtons (method B120). Test specimens of 10x10x4 mm may be cut from molded 80x10x4 mm ISO impact bars. Each test may be performed in duplicate and the average of the two results reported. [00116] The compositions may have Vicat B120 softening temperatures ranging from 120 °C to 230 °C, 140 °C to 185 °C, 145 °C to 180 °C, 150 °C to 175 °C, 155 °C to 170 °C, or 160 °C to 165 °C, measured in accordance with ISO 306. The compositions may have a Vicat B120 softening temperature of 150 °C, 151 °C, 152 °C, 153 °C, 154 °C, 155 °C, 156 °C, 157 °C, 158 °C, 159 °C, 160 °C, 161 °C, 162 °C, 163 °C, 164 °C, 165 °C, 166 °C, 167 °C, 168 °C, 169 °C, 170 °C, 171 °C, 172 °C, 173 °C, 174 °C, or 175 °C, measured in accordance with ISO 306. [00117] Multiaxial impact testing (MAI) may be performed according to ISO 6603 or ASTM D3763. This procedure provides information on how a material behaves under multiaxial deformation conditions. The multiaxial impact value indicates the amount of energy the material absorbs during the test; a higher value generally indicates a better result. Impact properties that may be reported include Energy to Maximum Load, Energy to Failure, and Average Total Energy, all expressed in units of Joules. Ductility of tested parts may be expressed in percent ( D) based on whether the part fractured in a brittle or ductile manner. [00118] Multiaxial impact may be measured using injection molded plaques (e.g., disks 3.2 mm thick and 10 centimeters in diameter). The plaques may be prepared using standard molding conditions or abusive molding conditions. Standard molding conditions may refer to a barrel temperature of 580 °F and a residence time of 35 seconds. Abusive molding conditions may refer to a barrel temperature of 580-620 °F and a residence time of 120 seconds. Abusive molding conditions may refer to conditions where the composition dwells in the molder barrel for an extended period of time and/or under elevated molding temperatures that may cause thermal degradation of one or more polymers in the composition. An apparatus, such as a Dynatup, may be used to evaluate multiaxial impact, and may have a tup of 10 mm, 12.5 mm, or 20 mm. The impact velocity may be 4.4 m/s. Measurements may be conducted at various temperatures (e.g., 23 °C, 0 °C, -30 °C). [00119] The blend compositions may have an Energy to Maximum Load of 10 J to 250 J, 50 J to 200 J, or 100 J to 150 J, at 23 °C, 0 °C, or -30 °C, molded under standard molding conditions. [00120] The blend compositions may have an Energy to Maximum Load of 10 J to 250 J, 50 J to 200 J, or 100 J to 150 J, at 23 °C, 0 °C, or -30 °C, molded under abusive molding conditions. [00121] The blend compositions may have an Energy to Failure of 10 J to 250 J, 50 J to 200 J, or 100 J to 150 J, at 23 °C, 0 °C, or -30 °C, molded under standard molding conditions. [00122] The blend compositions may have an Energy to Failure of 10 J to 250 J, 50 J to 200 J, or 100 J to 150 J, at 23 °C, 0 °C, or -30 °C, molded under abusive molding conditions. [00123] The blend compositions may have an Average Total Energy of 10 J to 250 J, 50 J to 200 J, or 100 J to 150 J, at 23 °C, 0 °C, or -30 °C, molded under standard molding conditions. [00124] The blend compositions may have an Average Total Energy of 10 J to 250 J, 50 J to 200 J, or 100 J to 150 J, at 23 °C, 0 °C, or -30 °C, molded under abusive molding conditions. [00125] The blend compositions may possess a ductility of greater than or equal to 50%, greater than or equal to 55%, greater than or equal to 60%, greater than or equal to 65%, greater than or equal to 70%, greater than or equal to 75%, greater than or equal to 80%, greater than or equal to 85%, greater than or equal to 90%, greater than or equal to 95%, or 100% in a notched izod impact test at -20 °C, -15 °C, -10 °C, 0 °C, 5 °C, 10 °C, 15 °C, 20 °C, 23 °C, 25 °C, 30 °C, or 35 °C at a thickness of 3.2 mm according to ASTM D3763. [00126] The blend compositions may have a notched izod impact (Nil). A higher Nil value indicates better impact strength. The polycarbonate compositions may have a notched izod impact strength (Nil) of greater than or equal to 5 kJ/m 2 , greater than or equal to 10 kJ/m 2 , greater than or equal to 15 kJ/m 2 , greater than or equal to 20 kJ/m 2 , greater than or equal to 25 kJ/m 2 , greater than or equal to 30 kJ/m 2 , greater than or equal to 35 kJ/m 2 , greater than or equal to 40 kJ/m 2 , greater than or equal to 45 kJ/m 2 , greater than or equal to 50 kJ/m 2 , greater than or equal to 55 kJ/m 2 , or greater than or equal to 60 kJ/m 2 , measured at 23 °C, 0 °C, or - 30 °C according to ISO 180. [00127] Metallization may be performed on molded parts (e.g., 1.5 mm or 3 mm thick) using a physical vapor deposition (PVD) process. This process deposits a 100 - 150 nm thick aluminum layer onto one side of the molded part under vacuum, followed by a protective plasma-deposited siloxane hard-coat of 50 nm. [00128] To determine haze onset temperatures, three metallized parts may placed in a calibrated air convection oven for 1.5 hrs. If no haze is observed, the oven temperature may be increased by 2 °C and the parts replaced with three fresh parts to avoid artifacts of in-situ annealing. Oven temperatures at which metallized parts are hazed may be recorded as haze onset temperatures. The parts used in the haze onset measurements may be dynatup parts (0.125" thickness) vacuum-metallized on one side (~80 nm thickness aluminum coating). The parts may be conditioned for the experiments by immediately placing the freshly metallized parts in sealed bags, and conditioned at 25 °C/50 relative humidity (RH) for 5 and 10 days prior to haze onset tests, while some parts may be kept unconditioned. [00129] A metallized 1.5 mm thick or 3 mm thick sample (e.g., plaque) of the blend composition may have a haze onset temperature of greater than or equal to 130 °C, greater than or equal to 135 °C, greater than or equal to 140 °C, greater than or equal to 145 °C, greater than or equal to 150 °C, greater than or equal to 155 °C, greater than or equal to 160 °C, greater than or equal to 165 °C, greater than or equal to 170 °C, or greater than or equal to 175 °C. [00130] Adhesion of a metal layer to a molded article comprising the blend compositions can be evaluated using the cross-hatch adhesion test method (ASTM 3359/ISO 2409). A GT0 rating is considered the best. To conduct the test, a lattice pattern of scratches may be scratched onto a metallized plaque by first making 6 parallel cuts with a cutting tool, and thereafter making another six cuts overlapping the original cuts at a 90 degree angle. These cuts result in a cross cut area of 25 squares being obtained. All loose material may then be removed with a brush. The lattice pattern may then be covered with tape (Tesa 4651). The tape may be removed quickly. The plaque is then ready for evaluation. The crosscut area may be evaluated and classified from GT0 to GT5 (excellent to poor). [00131] A metallized sample of the blend composition may pass a cross-hatch adhesion test (ASTM D 3359, ISO 2409) with a GT0 metal adhesion rating. A metallized sample of the blend composition may pass a cross-hatch adhesion test (ASTM D 3359, ISO 2409) with a GT1 metal adhesion rating. [00132] A metallized sample of the blend composition may pass a corrosion test. Corrosion testing may be performed via exposing metallized samples to a climate chamber at 40°C and 98% relative humidity as described in the DIN50017. The sample may be exposed for a time period of 120 hour or 240 hours. A metallized sample of the blend composition may exhibit 10% or less, 9% or less, 8% or less, 7% or less, 5% or less, 4% or less, 3% or less, 2% or less, 1% or less, or 0% corrosion when stored for 120 hours or 240 hours at 98% relative humidity at 40 °C, in accordance with DIN 50017. [00133] Yellowness Index (YI) for laboratory scale samples may be determined using a HunterLab Color System. Yellowness Index (YI) may be measured according to ASTM D1925 on plaques of 3 mm thickness and on films of 0.2 mm thickness. Films can be prepared in a petri dish by casting from a solution of 1.1 grams of a polycarbonate in 10 ml chloroform. A molded sample of the polycarbonate blend composition can have a yellow index less than or equal to 15, less than or equal to 10, less than or equal to 5, less than or equal to 1, or 0, as measured according to ASTM D1925. [00134] Metallized gloss measurements may be carried out using a BKY Gardner trigloss instrument. Measurements can be recorded at 20 degrees. To determine gloss before and after heat aging, 4 inchx4 inch (10.2 cmxlO.2 cm) molded plaques may be tested before and after aging at 160 °C for 1 hour, for example. A metallized article prepared from the polycarbonate blend composition can have a gloss greater than or equal to 1000 units, greater than or equal to 1100 units, greater than or equal to 1200 units, greater than or equal to 1300 units, great than or equal to 1400 units, greater than or equal to 1500 units, greater than or equal to 1600 units, greater than or equal to 1700 units, greater than or equal to 1750 units, greater than or equal to 1800 units, greater than or equal to 1850 units, greater than or equal to 1900 units, greater than or equal to 1950 units, or 2000 units, measured at 20 degrees using a trigloss meter. A metallized article prepared from the polycarbonate blend composition can retain 80% or greater, 85% or greater, 90% or greater, 95% or greater, or 100% of its gloss after heat aging (e.g., heat aging at 150 °C for one hour, or 160 °C for one hour). A metallized article prepared from the polycarbonate blend composition can have a gloss greater than or equal to 1000 units, greater than or equal to 1500 units, greater than or equal to 1900 units, greater than or equal to 1950 units, or 2000 units, measured at 20 degrees using a trigloss meter; and can retain 80% or greater, 85% or greater, 90% or greater, 95% or greater, or 100% of its gloss after heat aging (e.g., heat aging at 150 °C for one hour, or 160 °C for one hour). [00135] Reflectivity of metallized parts may be determined. Reflectivity may be assessed using a spectrophotometer (e.g., an X-rite 1-7 spectrophotometer) in reflection mode with specular light excluded (e.g., specular excluded mode using a 25 mm aperture according to ASTM D1003 using D65 illumination and a 10 degree observer angle). A mirror image has a high level of specular reflection. Hence when specular reflection is excluded from the measurement, a highly reflective, mirror like metallized surface will give low L*. A decrease in mirror like reflectivity will give more diffuse light scattering and hence give a higher L*. [00136] A metallized sample of the blend composition may have high reflectivity.

[00143] There is also provided an article formed from the compositions (via, e.g., injection molding), and having a metallized surface, wherein the metallized surface retains 80% or more, 85% or more, 90% or more, or 95% or more of its gloss after heat aging at 160° C for 1 hour, measured at 20 degrees using a trigloss meter. A base coat can be present between the article and the metallized surface, or the surface of the article can be directly metallized without a base coat. [00144] In certain embodiments, there is provided an article formed from the compositions, specifically a composition having up to 2 wt % of a particulate filler, or no filler, and having a metallized surface, wherein the metallized surface retains 80% or more, 85% or more, 90% or more, or 95% or more of its gloss after heat aging at 150° C for 1 hour, measured at 20 degrees using a tri gloss meter. An undercoat can be present between the article and the metallized surface, or a surface of the article can be directly metallized. [00145] In certain embodiments, there is provided an article formed from the compositions, where the compositions include one or more additives such as, for example, antioxidants, flame retardants, heat stabilizers, light stabilizers, antistatic agents, colorants, and the like. An antioxidant stabilizer composition can be used, such as for example a hindered diol stabilizer, a thioester stabilizer, an amine stabilizer, a phosphite stabilizer, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing types of stabilizers. [00146] The polycarbonate compositions may be molded into useful shaped articles by a variety of methods, such as injection molding, extrusion, rotational molding, compression molding, blow molding, sheet or film extrusion, profile extrusion, gas assist molding, structural foam molding, and thermoforming. Additional fabrication operations for preparing the articles include, but are not limited to, molding, in-mold decoration, baking in a paint oven, lamination, metallization, and/or thermoforming. [00147] Various types of gates can be employed for preparing molded articles, such as for example, side gates, spoke gates, pin gates, submarine gates, film gates, disk gates, or any combination thereof. [00148] The article may be produced by a manufacturing process. The process may include (a) providing a polycarbonate composition as disclosed herein; (b) melting the composition, for example at 200-400 °C, 225-350 °C, or 270-300 °C in an extruder; (c) extruding the composition; and (d) isolating the composition. The article may be further produced by (e) drying the composition and (f) melt forming the composition. [00149] A method of preparing a metallized article can include molding a composition into a predetermined mold dimensioned to a selected article as described above; and subjecting the molded article to a metallization process (e.g., vacuum deposition processes, vacuum sputtering processes, or a combination thereof). An exemplary method can include the general steps of an initial pump down on a molded article in a vacuum chamber; glow discharge/plasma clear; and metal deposition and application of a topcoat. Exemplary metals for metallization include, but are not limited to, chrome, nickel, and aluminum. The surface of the molded item can be cleaned and degreased before vapor deposition in order to increase adhesion. A base coat can optionally be applied before metallization, for example, to improve metal layer adhesion. In certain embodiments, the metallized article is manufactured without applying a base coat prior to metallization. [00150] A method of preparing a metallized article can include molding an article and subsequently metallizing the article using a physical vapor deposition (PVD) metallization process. During the metallization process, high vacuum may be applied and the article treated with plasma to create a polar surface to enhance adhesion. Subsequent to plasma treatment, a metal (e.g., aluminum) can be vaporized to deposit a selected thickness (e.g., 100 nm to 150 nm) of metal layer onto the article surface. This step may be followed with applying a plasma-deposit siloxane hardcoat of selected thickness (e.g., 50 nm) to protect the metal layer against oxidation and scratches. [00151] A method of preparing a metallized article can include mounting an article (e.g., on a rack) after molding and cleaning the article (e.g., with ionized air); positioning the article in a vacuum chamber; and metallizing the article under reduced pressure (e.g., using physical vapor deposition). After metallization, a protective transparent layer may be applied to the metallized article. For example, hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDS) or SiOx may be applied in the vacuum chamber, or a silicone hard coat may be applied outside the vacuum chamber. In certain embodiments, the metallization process includes the steps of forepumping, glow discharge, high vacuum pumping, coating (thermal coating in high vacuum), cool-down time, protective coating (glow discharge polymerization), venting, and charging. [00152] A method of preparing a metallized article can include drying a molded article (e.g., in a circulating oven) at a selected temperature (e.g., 275 °F) and time (e.g., 8 hours). The molded article can optionally be placed in a bag (e.g., ziplock bag) and heat sealed to minimize moisture uptake prior to metallization. The molded article can be placed on an open rack in a controlled environment at a selected temperature (e.g., 23 °C), and humidity (e.g., 50% relative humidity), and for a selected time (e.g., 1 to 5 days). The molded article may then be metallized (e.g., with evaporative metallization or sputtering). Evaporative metallization may include the process of having a metal resistively heated under deep vacuum that is subsequently allowed to cool onto exposed surfaces. [00153] A method of preparing a metallized article can include providing an article into a vacuum chamber and pumping down the vacuum chamber (e.g., using a roughing pump to obtain a pressure of 8x10 -"2 mbar, following by a fine pump to achieve a pressure of 1x10 -"3 mbar). After the pump down, the pressure can be increased (e.g., to 2.5x10" mbar) by adding a selected gas (e.g., argon or an oxygen/argon mixture) into the chamber. A glow discharge plasma clean may be implemented (e.g., at 40kHz/3kW) to prepare the article surface for metallization. The chamber may then be pumped down to a suitable pressure (e.g., 1.3xl0"4) prior to metallization. Next, metal deposition (e.g., aluminum deposition) may be implemented for a suitable time (e.g., 1 minute) to apply a selected thickness of metal (e.g., 70 to 100 nm). Following evaporative deposition of the metal, the pressure can be increased in the vacuum chamber (e.g., to 4x10" mbar) in preparation for topcoat application (e.g., HMDS topcoat). The topcoat material (e.g., HDMS) may be introduced into the vacuum chamber to apply a protective layer (e.g., a 45 nm protective HMDS layer) under glow discharge conditions (e.g., for 180 min). [00154] A method of preparing a metallized article can include an initial pump down (e.g., less than 10"5 Mbar); glow discharge pretreatment (e.g., using air, pressure of 10"1 Mbar, voltage 4Kv, time 1 minute); pump down (e.g., less than 10"5 Mbar); thermal aluminum evaporation (e.g., in 1 minute); and plasil protective layer application under glow discharge (e.g., using air, pressure 10"1 Mbar, voltage 4Kv, time 1 minute). [00155] A method of preparing a metallized article can provide an article with a metal layer thickness of, for example, 10 nm to 300 nm, 50 nm to 200 nm, 75 nm to 175 nm, 100 to 150 nm, or 70 nm to 100 nm. [00156] A topcoat (e.g., siloxane hard-coat) can be applied to a metallized article, the topcoat having a thickness of, for example, 5 nm to 150 nm, 10 nm to 100 nm, 30 nm to 75 nm, 40 nm to 60 nm, or 45 nm to 55 nm. [00157] A wide variety of articles can be manufactured using the disclosed compositions, including components for lighting articles, particularly optical reflectors. The optical reflectors can be used in automotive headlamps, headlamp bezels, headlight extensions and headlamp reflectors, for indoor illumination, for vehicle interior illumination, and the like. [00158] In the manufacture of an optical reflector, the thermoplastic composition can be molded, an optional base coat can be applied to a surface of the article, followed by metallization of the surface. In certain embodiments, a base coat is not applied to a surface of the molded article prior to metallization. The surfaces of the molded items are smooth and good gloss can be obtained even by direct metal vapor deposition without treating the molded item with primer. Moreover, because the release properties of the molded item during injection molding are good, the surface properties of the molded item are superior without replication of mold unevenness. [00159] The articles, in particular lighting articles, can have one or more of the following properties: very low mold shrinkage; good surface gloss even when metal layers are directly vapor deposited; no residue on the mold after long molding runs; and the vapor deposited surfaces do not become cloudy or have rainbow patterns even on heating of the vapor deposited surface. The articles further can have good heat stability. [00160] The polycarbonate blend compositions preferably have one or more beneficial properties for the production of heat resistant articles (e.g., automotive bezels), and in particular, metallizable heat resistant articles. It has been unexpectedly found that the compositions disclosed herein can be prepared having a combination of thermal, mechanical, and rheological properties that exceed currently available technologies.

[00196] Vicat B120 softening temperatures were measured according to ISO 306-2013. [00197] Notched Izod Impact (Nil) Strength is used to compare the impact resistances of plastic materials. Notched Izod impact strength was determined using a 3.2 mm (4 mm for ISO) thick, molded, notched Izod impact bar. It was determined per D256-2010 or ISO 180- 2000. The results are reported in Joules per meter (ASTM) or kJ/m (ISO). Tests were conducted at room temperature (23° C) and at low temperatures (0 °C and -30 °C). [00198] Multiaxial impact energies were measured according to ASTM D3763-2010 or ISO 6603. [00199] Heat deflection temperature (HDT) is a relative measure of a material's ability to perform for a short time at elevated temperatures while supporting a load. The test measures the effect of temperature on stiffness: a standard test specimen is given a defined surface stress and the temperature is raised at a uniform rate. HDT was determined as flatwise under 1.82 MPa or 0.45 MPa loading with 3.2 mm (4mm for ISO) thickness bar according to ASTM D648-2007 or ISO 75-2013. Results are reported in °C. [00200] Melt volume rate (MVR) was measured at 300°C/2.16 kg or 330°C/2.16 kg as per ASTM D1238-2010 or ISO 1133-2011. Melt viscosity (MV) was measured according to IS011443 at a temperature of 300 °C or 316 °C and shear rate of 1500 or 5000 s"1. [00201] Melt flow rate was measured according to ASTM D1238-2010 or ISO 1133-2011. [00202] Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) employing a temperature sweep rate of 20°C/min was used to determine glass transition temperatures. [00203] Spiral flow test: The spiral flow length was measured under a molding temperature of 330°C, a mold temperature of 100°C, and an injection pressure of 300mm/s. The resulting molded parts had a thickness of 1 mm and a width of 15 mm. [00204] Yellowness Index (YI) was measured using the ASTM D1925 test method on plaques of 3 mm thickness and on films of 0.2 mm thickness. Films were prepared in a petri dish by casting from a solution of 1.1 grams of a polycarbonate in 10 ml of chloroform. [00205] Color data was acquired on an X-rite 1-7 spectrophotometer in the range 360 nm to 750 nm. The reflection data was acquired in specular excluded mode using a 25 mm aperture according to ASTM D1003 using D65 illumination and a 10 degree observer angle. A mirror image has a high level of specular reflection. Hence when specular reflection is excluded from the measurement, a highly reflective, mirror like metallized surface will give low L*. A decrease in mirror like reflectivity will give more diffuse light scattering and hence give a higher L*. [00206] Metallization was performed on molded parts from a film gate injection set-up having dimensions 60mm x 60mm and a thickness of either 3 mm or 1.5 mm using the physical vapor deposition (PVD) process. This process deposits a 100 - 150 nm thick aluminum layer onto one side of the molded part under vacuum, followed by a protective plasma-deposited siloxane hard-coat of 50 nm. The initial metallization performance was assessed by 2 well-trained operators as acceptable ("OK") or not acceptable ("NOK"). Metal adhesion was tested according to the ASTM3359/ISO2409 method using a tape (Scotch 898) pull test on a metallized surface inscribed with a Crosshatch, using a rating system with GT0 indicating no delamination and GT5 indicating 100% delamination. Corrosion testing was performed via exposing metallized samples to a climate chamber at 40°C and 98% relative humidity as described in the DIN50017 procedure. Haze onset was determined as the highest temperature at which no visual defects appear after 1 hour of heat aging in an air circulating oven, exposing all sides of the sample (symmetric heating). [00207] Haze measurements were performed on rectangular injection molded plaques having dimensions of 6"Lx2.5"Wx0.125"T according to ASTM D1003. [00208] Transmittance was measured according to ASTM D1003, and defined in the following formula as: %T - (171o)xl00%; wherein: Ϊ - intensity of the light passing through the test sample; and i - Intensity of incident light, [00209] Molecular weight determinations were performed using GPC, using a cross-linked styrene-divinylbenzene column and calibrated to bisphenol-A polycarbonate standards using a UV-VIS detector set at 254 nm. Samples were prepared at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, and eluted at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. [00210] Table 1 summarizes the exemplary materials components of the polycarbonate blend compositions. The listed copolymers and polycarbonate resins were prepared by methods known in the art. All other chemical entities were purchased from the commercial sources listed.

All solid additives (e.g., stabilizers, colorants, solid flame retardants) were dry blended offline as concentrates using one of the primary polymer powders as a carrier and starve-fed via gravimetric feeder(s) into the feed throat of the extruder. The remaining polymer(s) were starve-fed via gravimetric feeder(s) into the feed throat of the extruder as well. [00212] Extrusion of all materials was performed on a 25 mm Werner-Pfleiderer ZAK twin-screw extruder (L/D ratio of 33/1) with a vacuum port located near the die face. The extruder has 9 zones, which were set at temperatures of 40 °C (feed zone), 200 °C (zone 1), 250 °C (zone 2), 270 °C (zone 3), and 280-300 °C (zone 4 to 8). Screw speed was 300 rpm and throughput was between 15 and 25 kg/hr. [00213] The compositions were molded after drying at 135°C for 4 hours on a 45-ton Engel molding machine with 22 mm screw or 75-ton Engel molding machine with 30 mm screw operating at a temperature around 310°C with a mold temperature of 100°C. [00214] Unless stated otherwise, the phrase "0.4 wt additives" or a derivation thereof, as used in the following tables, refers to 0.27 wt pentaerythritol tetrastearate (PETS) + 0.08 wt phosphite stabilizer (e.g., Iragafos 168) + 0.04 wt hindered phenol (e.g., Irgafos 1076). [00215] Polyester flow aids were incorporated into polycarbonate blend compositions to lower viscosity and create high heat compositions that process more easily. The performance properties of these compositions are displayed in Table 2. The composition 4 containing PBT demonstrated the greatest increase in flow rates (MVR, MFR) and reduction in viscosity while also maintaining high impact strength. Table 2 [00216] Further studies incorporating PBT and PET into blends containing PPPBP-PC-1 and PC-6 are displayed in Table 3. Compositions containing 2-5% PBT and 4-6% PET demonstrated improvements in flow and viscosity. However, these improvements were accompanied by a reduction in heat (Tg).

These compositions possessed the best balance of flow and heat properties. Table 4 [00218] Table 5 shows that compositions 26 and 28 exhibited significantly increased melt flow rates and lowered melt viscosities. At the same time, 26 and 28 demonstrated a maintenance of heat capability (e.g., see their values for HDT and Tg). [00219] These compositions were made by powder to pellet conversion and compounding of experimental samples using a single screw lab line, S2. All ingredients were tumble- blended prior to compounding and fed using a single feeder to the extruder. The typical sample size for this extruder is 3 kg. Standard injection molding was done at 580 °F with 35 s cycle time. Abusive molding was done at 580 °F with 120 s cycle time. Table 5 [00220] Metallization data for 26 and 28 is summarized in Table 6. Metallized samples pass haze onset at thicknesses of 3.0 mm and 1.5 mm at temperatures up to 165 °C. Table 6 also displays that the compositions pass the cross-hatch adhesion test with the highest rating of GTO at both thicknesses. In addition, both 26 and 28 pass the corrosion test in a humid environment for up to 10 days. Table 6 [00221] Incorporation of the flow aid PBT with high temperature PC-8 was also investigated (Table 7), although this strategy to improve flow properties in this polycarbonate blend had limited success. Incorporation of PBT into the PC-8 blends lowered melt viscosity and improved melt flow rate with greater amounts of PBT. However, melt viscosities were higher than those observed for the corresponding PPPBP-PC-1 blends (Table 5), and heat capability is compromised significantly. Overall, the flow improvements demonstrated from modification of the PC-8 blend are much less pronounced than the improvements noted above in compositions 26 and 28. Table 7 [00222] Table 8 shows PBT as a flow aid in blends with 68 wt PPPBP-PC-1 and BPA polycarbonate produced by interfacial or melt polymerization. Melt viscosity is decreased similarly in blends with either interfacial or melt produced polycarbonate with the addition of 1.5% or 5% PBT. Heat deflection temperature is also similar with both types of polycarbonate in the corresponding blends with PBT, and notched Izod impact values are maintained in all blends. Table 8 to ISO180. [00223] The balance between flow and impact properties of PPPBP-PC containing compositions were significantly improved by the addition of polysiloxane-polycarbonate copolymers. In addition, these improved compositions showed no loss in aesthetics, metallization properties, or heat. As such, compositions were obtained that have significantly improved impact performance properties at a given flow level, as show in in Tables 9-12. [00224] Composition 40 including PPPBP-PC-1 and PC-Si- 1, and composition 41 further including PC-3, both demonstrated similar visual appearance, Crosshatch adhesion, and corrosion resistance compared to compositions including PPPBP-PC-1 and PC-1 and/or PC-2 (38, 39) (Table 9). Compositions 40 and 41 also have similar haze onset as compositions 38 and 39 at the same MVR level. These results demonstrate that inclusion of PC-siloxane copolymers in PPPBP-PC- 1/PC blends does not have a negative effect on the metallization properties, while the flow/ impact balance is improved. Table 9 [00225] Additional PPPBP-PC/PC-siloxane blends were produced to explore the effect of varying the amounts of PC-siloxane in the composition (Table 10). In all cases, heat properties were comparable to 42, a non-PC- siloxane containing blend. Significant improvements in Nil and MAI (at low temp) strengths were observed upon incorporation of PC-Si-1 or PC-Si-2, especially at higher loadings. Table 10 Melt Viscosity was measured according to ISOH443; Vicat B120 was measured according to IS0306; HDT was measured according to IS075; Nil was measured according to ISO180; MAI was measured according to ISO6603. [00226] Compositions including the lower molecular weight PPPBP-PC-3 resin were evaluated, as shown in Table 11. Thermal properties decreased by a few degrees Celsius compared to the corresponding composition including PPPBP-PC-1. The compositions including PC-siloxane showed significant improvements in Izod notched impact and multi axial impact (at low temp), especially at higher loadings. By changing to a lower molecular weight PPPBP-PC resin, a significant improvement in flow was observed. Table 11 according to IS075; Nil was measured according to ISO180; MAI was measured according to ISO6603. [00227] Table 12 shows that compositions including 45 wt% PPPBP-PC-1 and a PC- siloxane retained heat properties comparable to the non-PC- siloxane containing composition 62. Upon inclusion of PC-Si-1 or PC-Si-2, the Vicat B120 softening temperature is not affected. Significant improvements in Izod notched impact and multi axial impact (at low temp) for PC-Si-1 and PC-Si-2 are noted, especially at higher loadings. These compositions additionally retained or improved flow properties (MVR). Ultimately, in both the 64% PPPBP-PC-1 modified compositions and 45% PPPBP-PC-1 compositions, the incorporation of PC-siloxane (either PC-Si-1 or PC-Si-2) provided significant improvement in impact-flow balance, while retaining heat. Table 12 I Composition | 62 | 63 | 64 | 65 | 66 | 67 | 68 | 69 | 70 | 71 | 72 according to IS075; Nil was measured according to ISO180; MAI was measured according to ISO6603. [00228] Table 13 shows that incorporation of PDMS in the PPPBP-PC blends resulted in negative aesthetic issues on molded parts, which may result in failures upon metallization (visual appearance). In addition, impact properties significantly deteriorated, especially at the higher loading of PDMS (composition 76). Incorporation of PMPS yielded no aesthetic issues, but resulted in significant deterioration of Izod impact properties (compositions 77 and 78).

[00229] Table 14 shows that impact modifier systems such as ABS / SAN, MBS / SAN, Bulk ABS and silicone acrylics were used to improve the impact / flow balance. Although it was possible to improve these properties, the metallization of molded parts based on these compositions were not acceptable ("NOK"). Table 14 MVR was measured according to ISOH33; Melt Viscosity was measured according to ISOH443; Vicat B120 was measured according to IS0306; HDT was measured according to IS075; Nil was measured according to ISO180; MAI was measured according to ISO6603. [00230] The flow properties of PPPBP-PC compositions were also improved by lowering the molecular weight of the accompanying BPA polycarbonate resins in the blends. By implementation of this lower molecular weight polycarbonate resin approach, compositions were obtained that have improved impact properties. [00231] Table 15 summarizes the compositions made by this approach, as well as their performance under a variety of experimental conditions. Replacing high molecular weight polycarbonate (PC-1) with lower molecular weight polycarbonate (PC-2, PC-3, or PC-7) improved flow properties, and heat properties were maintained relative to composition 42. Composition 43 showed a slight decrease in room temperature ductility, however, impact performance was improved or comparable to 42 for the remaining compositions. Decreasing the amount of PPPBP-PC-1 copolymer resulted in an improvement of flow properties accompanied by a worsening of heat properties (compositions 85 and 86). The opposite effect was observed when the amount of PPPBP-PC-1 was increased (compositions 87-89). These results also showed that incorporation of a lower molecular weight polycarbonate does not have an influence on metallization performance of the composition. Table 15 Melt Viscosity was measured according to ISOH443; Vicat B120 was measured according to ISO306; HDT was measured according to IS075; Nil was measured according to ISO180; MAI was measured according to ISO6603. [00232] Table 16 shows that an increase in melt flow was also achieved by the employment of lower molecular weight PPPBP-BPA copolymer (17k or 20k) in the blends. Compositions containing lower molecular weight PPPBP copolymer were evaluated in comparison to the corresponding compositions containing 23k molecular weight PPPBP. [00233] Impact properties of the lower molecular weight compositions are not adversely affected in comparison to composition 42, however, composition 97 showed a decrease in room temperature ductility. Taken together, these results demonstrated that by lowering the molecular weight of the PPPBP-PC copolymer, flow properties were improved and heat and impact properties were maintained. In addition, these results also demonstrated that replacing the higher molecular weight PC-1 with the lower molecular weight PC-2 or PC-3 improved flow properties (see trends of compositions 92-94 and 95-97). Table 16 according to IS075; Nil was measured according to ISO180; MAI was measured according to ISO6603. [00234] Table 17 shows the combination of PPPBP-PC-3 with a variety of polycarbonates and/or additives. The most significant flow increase without a concurrent loss of melt stability and heat capability was observed with compositions 101 and 102. These blends also maintained impact strength. Incorporation of PC-4 (100) resulted in the melt viscosity and flow unimproved - yet still improved compared to 1 (standard, MV=160 Pa*s under same conditions). Compositions including 65% of the PPPBP-PC-3 and 1-2% PBT (compositions 103-106) displayed poor melt stability, as demonstrated by the loss of 30-58% viscosity (at 316 °C, 1800 seconds). Table 17 [00235] The performance properties of compositions 101 and 102 are shown in Table 18. These findings reinforced the previous results demonstrating that melt flow properties are improved when PPPBP-PC-1 is replaced with PPPBP-PC-3, and are further improved by blending with additional lower molecular weight polycarbonates. For example, a decrease in high shear melt viscosity was observed for compositions 99, 101, and 102 (111, 100, and 96 Pa-s, respectively) by blending lower molecular weight polycarbonates with PPPBP-PC-3. In addition, heat is unchanged as the glass transition temperatures of the blends are maintained at 171-172 °C. Table 18 [00236] Table 19 shows that 101 and 102 passed the haze onset at 3.0 mm (165 °C), cross hatch adhesion, and corrosion tests for both natural and black materials. For 1.5 mm samples, a small mold defect appeared, and the sample of composition 101 with natural color had a small corrosion spot after 10 days of hydro aging. Table 19 [00237] Further modification of compositions 101 and 102 was achieved by replacing the PPPBP-PC-3 with PPPBP-PC-2 in the blends. The performance properties of these blends are shown in Table 20. Impact properties (MAI) are maintained under both standard and abusive molding conditions while flow properties are improved (increased MVR, increased MFR, decreased high shear melt viscosity) compared to 1. Table 20 [00238] Properties of blends with PPPBP-PC- 1 and PPPBP-PC-4 are shown in Table 21. The decrease in mol% PPPBP in a copolymer of the same Mw did not result in significant changes in properties, showing that molecular weight is controlling melt flow properties. Melt flow rate did not increase when PPPBP-PC-1 was replaced with PPPBP-PC-4. Melt viscosity at 5000 s"1 increased slightly to 166 Pa*s when PPPBP-PC-1 was replaced with PPPBP-PC-4. Heat deflection temperature and Tg did not change significantly when PPPBP- PC-1 was replaced with PPPBP-PC-4. Multi Axial Impact, Total Energy of 72-74 J and 100% ductility were maintained under standard molding conditions when PPPBP-PC-1 was replaced with PPPBP-PC-4. Multi Axial Impact, Total Energy of 74-75 J and 100% ductility were maintained under abusive molding conditions when PPPBP-PC-1 was replaced with PPPBP-PC-4. Table 21 [00239] Table 22 shows properties of blends with 45 wt PPPBP-PC-3 and 55 wt of polycarbonate components. The melt flow rate increased from 43 to 72 g/10 min when PPPBP-PC-1 was replaced with PPPBP-PC-3, and further increased to 93 g/lOmin by blending with lower Mw BPA polycarbonate resins. The MVR increased from 40 cm /lOmin to 68 cm3/10min when PPPBP-PC-1 was replaced with PPPBP-PC-3, and was further increased to 87-89 cm /lOmin by blending with lower Mw BPA polycarbonates. A decrease occurred in high shear melt viscosity (measured at 5000s"1) from 133 to 101 Pa-s with PPPBP-PC-3, and further decreased to 84-88 Pa-s in blends of PPPBP-PC-3 with lower Mw BPA polycarbonate. Tg was maintained at 165-167 °C for blends with PPPBP-PC-3, and 160-162 °C for blends with lower Mw polycarbonates. HDT was maintained at 154-155 °C for all blends with PPPBP-PC-3. Multi Axial Impact, Total Energy of 68-72 J and 100% ductility were maintained under standard molding conditions when PPPBP-PC-1 was replaced with PPPBP-PC-3.

Implementation of this strategy to improve flow properties promoted the retention of properties such as thermal resistance and impact strength. [00241] Tables 23 and 24 show that a variety of alkylene glycols (e.g., PEG, PPG, ethylene glycol) were shown to improve flow properties in a series of compositions. However, heat properties of these compositions decreased slightly in comparison to 42. A correlation between the molecular weight of PEG incorporated into the composition and the effectiveness of flow promotion was observed. The lower molecular weight PEG was more effective at improving the flow, whereas the higher molecular weight PEG showed less of an improvement. THAM is an additional flow promoter that also demonstrated the ability to improve flow properties of the PPPBP-PC compositions, while heat and impact performance properties were maintained (composition 128). Table 23 Melt Viscosity was measured according to ISOH443; Vicat B120 was measured according to ISO306; HDT was measured according to IS075; Nil was measured according to ISO180; MAI was measured according to ISO6603. Table 24 according to IS075; Nil was measured according to ISO180; MAI was measured according to ISO6603. [00242] Table 25 demonstrates that the addition of PC-Si-2 copolymer to PPPBP-PC- 1 compositions containing PEG-1 led to achievement of low temperature ductility while improving flow and maintaining impact strength (e.g., composition 136). Table 25 according to IS075; Nil was measured according to ISO180; MAI was measured according to ISO6603. [00243] Glycerol monosterate (GMS) is a further example of an alkylene alcohol derivative which also gave much improved flow in compositions containing high heat copolymers such as PPPBP-PC-1 (Table 26) and PC-8 (Table 27) and compositions containing PC-siloxane (Table 28). Compositions containing combinations of GMS and PETS or GTS are even more beneficial for flow improvement. Table 26 Composition 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 MAI, 0°C ductility (%) - 20 0 100 100 80 Melt Viscosity was measured according to ISOH443; Vicat B120 was measured according to IS0306; HDT was measured according to IS075; Nil was measured according to ISO180; MAI was measured according to ISO6603. Table 27 MVR measured according to IS0306; HDT was measured according to IS075; Nil was measured according to ISO180; MAI was measured according to ISO6603. Table 28 measured according to IS0306; HDT was measured according to IS075; Nil was measured according to ISO180; MAI was measured according to ISO6603. [00244] Table 29 demonstrates that bisphenol-A can also be used as a flow promoter. Table 29 Melt Viscosity was measured according to ISOH443; Vicat B120 was measured according to IS0306; HDT was measured according to IS075; Nil was measured according to ISO180; MAI was measured according to ISO6603. [00245] While polyester additives are effective at increasing the melt flow rate of PPPBP- PC blends (Tables 2-8), the melt stabilities of these blends were limited at typical high heat polycarbonate processing temperatures. To improve the stability of these blends at high heat and to avoid discoloration, compositions that incorporate alternative stabilizer packages were developed. [00246] Variant compositions of 26 with alternative stabilizer packages were prepared (Table 30). The stabilizers used for the compositions include PEPQ (higher Mw phosphite stabilizer), MZP (acid quencher), and phosphoric acid (H3PO4). Additionally, in some formulations, hindered phenol stabilizer was removed or replaced with hydroxyl octaphenyl benzotriazole. [00247] The compositions were prepared by powder to pellet conversion and compounding through the use of a single screw lab line. All ingredients were tumble-blended prior to compounding and fed using a single feeder to the extruder. Standard injection molding was done at 580 °F with a 35s cycle time. Abusive molding was done at 580 °F with a 120s cycle time. [00248] The compositions containing PEPQ (compositions 165-170) in place of the standard stabilizer package of 26 showed a significant decrease in Yellowness Index (YI). These compositions also maintained high flow and similar heat (Tg/HDT) and impact properties in comparison to 26. However, there was no improvement in melt stability (parallel plate viscosity change after 1800s). Table 30 [00249] Table 31 shows additional stabilizer packages that were investigated. A thioester antioxidant, pentaerythritol tetrakis-(3-dodecylthiopropionate), was employed as a stabilizer in conjunction with PEPQ and/or MZP in a modification of 26. Table 31 highlights that the YI was again significantly improved in all compositions containing PEPQ. The addition of pentaerythritol tetrakis-(3-dodecylthiopropionate) also improved YI, but less significantly. The compositions containing pentaerythritol tetrakis-(3-dodecylthiopropionate) (compositions 171-174) resulted in decreased flow, but improved melt stabilities (parallel plate viscosity change). Heat was maintained in all compositions, although a decrease in MAI energy was observed with the addition of MZP (173) or a higher loading of PEPQ (174). Table 31 [00250] Selected stabilizer packages from the experiments above were also evaluated in compositions containing 5% PET (Table 32). The experimental results of these PET containing blends incorporating PEPQ were in contrast to the results of the PBT containing blends of Table 31. All compositions containing 5% PET lost transparency (% T dropped from 88% to 66-74%) and had decreased flow (melt viscosity increased to 137-148 Pa-s). However, Tg increased to 185-188 °C, and melt stability improved, especially with PEPQ/ pentaerythritol tetrakis-(3-dodecylthiopropionate) combinations (compositions 179 and 180). Comparison of compositions 178 and 179 suggested that MZP aids in the reduction of haziness (increase in %T from 65 to 75%). This effect was also observed when comparing compositions 179 (PEPQ/ pentaerythritol tetrakis-(3-dodecylthiopropionate)) and 180 (PEPQ/ pentaerythritol tetrakis-(3-dodecylthiopropionate)/MZP), although the effect is much less pronounced in the presence of pentaerythritol tetrakis-(3-dodecylthiopropionate). Table 32 [00251] Copolyesters PCCD and PCTG were incorporated into PPPBP-PC containing compositions. The blends were made as a mixture of PPPBP-PC-3 with either PC-5 or a combination of PC-4 and PC-6 (Table 33). A pronounced anti- yellowing effect of PEPQ was also observed in this set of compositions. Comparison of compositions 181 (5% PCCD with standard stabilizer) and 182 (5% PCCD with PEPQ) or 184 (5% PCTG with standard stabilizer) and 185 (5% PCTG with PEPQ) demonstrated that PEPQ caused a significant decrease in YI in both PCCD and PCTG blends. [00252] The flow properties of these blends were further improved in comparison to 101, but addition of the polyesters caused a decrease in Tg, HDT and melt stability. However, due to the higher heat stability of PCTG and PCCD, the decreases in these properties were less than that observed with 5% PBT (Tables 30 and 31). In addition, the PPPBP-PC-3 copolymer content was maintained at 65%, while the compositions that contain PBT required 85% of the PPPBP-PC- 1 copolymer. In addition, the PPPBP-PC-3 containing blends showed an improvement in melt stability. Table 33 [00253] Decreased amounts of po yester flow aic Is (1-2% PBT, PET, PCC D, PCTG) were employed to modify the blend including PPPBP-PC-3 and PC-5 (101). As shown in Table 34, a decrease in melt viscosity was observed in all compositions composed of PEPQ and/or 1-2% of the polyester flow aids. The greatest flow improvement was observed with 1% PBT/1% PET (189), although this also resulted in the greatest decrease in melt stability. Incorporation of PEPQ caused a slight decrease in viscosity and melt stability even without the addition of any polyesters. These results demonstrated that PPPBP-PC-3 combined with small amounts of flow aid(s) maintained a low YI and resulted in a greater flow increase than with just PPPBP-PC-3 alone. Table 34 [00254] Decreased amounts of polyester flow aids (1-2% PBT, PET, PCCD, PCTG) were also were employed to modify the blends including PPPBP-PC-3 and a mixture of PC-4 and PC-6 (102). As shown in Table 35, melt viscosity is decreased in all compositions with PEPQ and/or 1-2% of the polyester flow aids. Again, the greatest flow improvement was with 1% PBT/1% PET (196), although this also resulted in the greatest decrease in melt stability. Incorporation of PEPQ caused a slight decrease in viscosity and melt stability even without the addition of any polyesters. As in the blends with PC-5, the PPPBP-PC-3 combined with small amounts of flow aid(s) maintained a low YI and resulted in a greater flow increase than with just PPPBP-PC-3 alone. These compositions also demonstrated less influence on melt stability than by the addition of increased amounts of flow aid.
