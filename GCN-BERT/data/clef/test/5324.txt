The invention includes herbicidal compositions comprising an herbicidally effective amount of a compound of Formula IA or IB in a mixture with an agriculturally acceptable adjuvant or carrier. The invention also includes a method of use of the compounds and compositions of the present invention to kill or control undesirable vegetation by application of an herbicidal amount of the compound to the vegetation or to the locus of the vegetation as well as to the soil prior to emergence of the vegetation or to the irrigation or flood water, prior to, or after emergence. The invention further includes a method for the selective postemergent control of undesirable vegetation in the presence of rice, wheat or forage, which comprises applying to said undesirable vegetation an herbicidally effective amount of a compound of the present invention. The invention also includes a method of making the compounds of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The herbicidal compounds of the present invention are arylyalkyl esters of 4-amino-6-(substituted phenyl)picolinic acids and 6-amino-2-(substituted phenyl)-4-pyrimidinecarboxylic acids and their derivatives. The picolinic acids from which the esters of Formula IB are derived are a new class of compounds having herbicidal activity. A number of picolinic acid compounds are described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,784,137 B2 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,314,849 B2, including inter alia, 4-amino-3-chloro-6-(4-chloro-2-fluoro-3-methoxy-phenyl)picolinic acid, 4-amino-3-chloro-5-fluoro-6-(4-chloro-2-fluoro-3-methoxyphenyl)picolinic acid and 4-amino-3-chloro-6-(2,4-dichloro-3-methoxyphenyl)picolinic acid. The pyrimidinecarboxylic acids from which the esters of Formula IA are derived are also a new class of compounds having herbicidal activity. A number of pyrimidinecarboxylic acid compounds are described in WO 2005/063721 A1, WO 2007/082076 A1, U.S. Pat. No. 7,863,220 B2, U.S. Pat. No. 7,300,907 B2, U.S. Pat. No. 7,642,220 B2, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,786,044 B2. These picolinic acids and pyrimidinecarboxylic acids control annual grass weeds, broadleaf weeds, and sedges in rice and wheat, but arylalkyl esters of the present invention demonstrate greater efficacy than the known esters, especially against weeds prominent in rice and wheat cropping systems and in pasture management programs. Preferred ester groups are those which produce greater levels of weed control than an acid equivalent rate of the methyl esters. Preferred ester groups include the unsubstituted benzyl ester and ortho-, meta-, and para-monosubstituted benzyl esters. The arylalkyl esters of the 6-amino-2-(substituted phenyl)-4-pyrimidinecarboxylic acids can be prepared by reacting the pyrimidinecarboxylic acid with an arylalkyl halide in the presence of a base. The arylalkyl esters of the picolinic acids can be prepared by coupling of picolinic acid with an alcohol using any number of suitable activating agents such as those used for peptide couplings such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or carbonyl diimidazole (CDI) or by reacting the corresponding acid with an appropriate arylalkyl alcohol in the presence of an acid catalyst. Alternatively, the arylalkyl esters can be prepared by reacting the picolinic acid with an arylalkyl halide in the presence of a base. It is recognized that some reagents and reaction conditions disclosed herein or in the chemical literature for preparing compounds of Formula IA or IB may not be compatible with certain functionalities present in the intermediates. In these instances, the incorporation of protection/deprotection sequences or functional group interconversions into the synthesis will aid in obtaining the desired products. The use and choice of the protecting groups will be apparent to one skilled in chemical synthesis. The terms “alkyl,” “alkenyl” and “alkynyl,” as well as derivative terms such as “alkoxy,” “acyl” and “alkylthio,” as used herein, include within their scope straight chain and branched chain moieties. Unless specifically stated otherwise, each may be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents selected from but not limited to halogen, alkoxy, alkylthio, or aminoalkyl, provided that the substituents are sterically compatible and the rules of chemical bonding and strain energy are satisfied. The terms “alkenyl” and “alkynyl” are intended to include one or more unsaturated bonds. The term “arylalkyl,” as used herein, refers to a phenyl substituted alkyl group having a total of 7 to 11 carbon atoms, such as benzyl (—CH2C6H5), 2-methylnaphthyl (—CH2C10H7) and 1- or 2-phenethyl (—CH2CH2C6H5 or —CH(CH3)C6H5). The phenyl group may itself be unsubstituted or substituted with one or more substituents independently selected from halogen, nitro, cyano, C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, halogenated C1-C6 alkyl, halogenated C1-C6 alkoxy, C1-C6 alkylthio, C(O)OC1-C6alkyl, or where two adjacent substituents are taken together as —O(CH2)nO— wherein n=1 or 2, provided that the substituents are sterically compatible and the rules of chemical bonding and strain energy are satisfied. Unless specifically limited otherwise, the term halogen includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. The compounds of Formula IA or IB have been found to be useful as pre-emergence and post-emergence herbicides for rice and cereals cropping systems and for pasture management programs. The term herbicide is used herein to mean an active ingredient that kills, controls or otherwise adversely modifies the growth of plants. An herbicidally effective or vegetation controlling amount is an amount of active ingredient which causes an adversely modifying effect and includes deviations from natural development, killing, regulation, desiccation, retardation, and the like. The terms plants and vegetation include germinating seeds, emerging seedlings, above and below ground plant parts such as shoots, roots, tubers, rhizomes and the like, and established vegetation. Herbicidal activity is exhibited by the compounds of the present invention when they are applied directly to the plant or to the locus of the plant at any stage of growth or before planting or emergence. The effect observed depends upon the plant species to be controlled, the stage of growth of the plant, the application parameters of dilution and spray drop size, the particle size of solid components, the environmental conditions at the time of use, the specific compound employed, the specific adjuvants and carriers employed, the soil type, water quality, and the like, as well as the amount of chemical applied. These and other factors can be adjusted as is known in the art to promote selective herbicidal action. Generally, it is preferred to apply the compounds of Formula IA or IB postemergence via spray or water application to relatively immature undesirable vegetation to achieve the maximum control of weeds. Application rates of about 1 to about 500 grams per hectare (g/ha) are generally employed in foliar-applied and water-applied postemergence operations. Preferred application rates are 10 to about 300 g/ha. For preemergence applications, rates of about 5 to about 500 g/ha are generally employed. Preferred application rates are 30 to about 300 g/ha. The higher rates designated generally give non-selective control of a broad variety of undesirable vegetation. The lower rates typically give selective control and can be employed in the locus of crops. The herbicidal compounds of the present invention are often applied in conjunction with one or more other herbicides to control a wider variety of undesirable vegetation. When used in conjunction with other herbicides, the presently claimed compounds can be formulated with the other herbicide or herbicides, tank mixed with the other herbicide or herbicides or applied sequentially with the other herbicide or herbicides. Some of the herbicides that can be employed in conjunction with the compounds of the present invention include: 2,4-D salts, esters and amines, acetochlor, acifluorfen, alachlor, amidosulfuron, aminopyralid, aminotriazole, ammonium thiocyanate, anilifos, atrazine, azimsulfuron, benfuresate, bensulfuron-methyl, bentazon, benthiocarb, benzobicyclon, benzofenap, bifenox, bispyribac-sodium, bromobutide, butachlor, cafenstrole, carfentrazone-ethyl, chlodinafop-propyrgyl, chlorimuron, chlorpropham, cinosulfuron, clethodim, clomazone, clomeprop, clopyralid, cloransulam-methyl, cyclosulfamuron, cycloxydim, cyhalofop-butyl, cumyluron, daimuron, diclosulam, diflufenican, diflufenzopyr, dimepiperate, dimethametryn, diquat, dithiopyr, EK2612, EPTC, esprocarb, ET-751, ethoxysulfuron, ethbenzanid, fenoxaprop, fenoxaprop-ethyl, fenoxaprop-ethyl+isoxadifen-ethyl, fentrazamide, flazasulfuron, florasulam, fluazifop, fluazifop-P-butyl, flucetosulfuron, flufenacet, flufenpyr-ethyl, flumetsulam, flumioxazin, flupyrsulfuron, fluoroxypyr, fomesafen, foramsulfuron, glufosinate, glufosinate-P, glyphosate, halosulfuron-methyl, haloxyfop-methyl, haloxyfop-R, haloxyfop-R-methyl, imazamethabenz, imazamox, imazapic, imazapyr, imazaquin, imazethapyr, imazosulfuron, indanofan, ioxynil, ipfencarbazone, isoxaben, MCPA, MCPB, mefenacet, mesosulfuron, mesotrione, metamifop, metazosulfuron, metolachlor, metosulam, metsulfuron, molinate, monosulfuron, MSMA, orthosulfamuron, oryzalin, oxadiargyl, oxadiazon, oxazichlomefone, oxyfluorfen, paraquat, pendimethalin, penoxsulam, pentoxazone, pethoxamid, picloram, piperophos, pretilachlor, profoxydim, prohexadione-calcium, propachlor, propanil, propisochlor, propyzamide, propyrisulfuron, prosulfuron, pyrabuticarb, pyraclonil, pyrazogyl, pyrazolynate, pyrazosulfuron-ethyl, pyrazoxyfen, pyribenzoxim, pyridate, pyriftalid, pyriminobac-methyl, pyrimisulfan, primisulfuron, pyroxsulam, quinoclamine, quinclorac, quizalofop-P-ethyl, S-3252, sethoxydim, simazine, simetryne, s-metolachlor, sulcotrione, sulfentrazone, sulfosate, tefuryltrione, thenylchlor, thiazopyr, thiobencarb, triclopyr, triclopyr-esters and amines, trifluralin, trinexapac-ethyl, tritosulfuron, and other 4-amino-6-(substituted phenyl)picolinates and 6-amino-2-(substituted phenyl)-4-pyrimidinecarboxylates and their salts and esters. The compounds of the present invention can additionally be employed to control undesirable vegetation in many crops that have been made tolerant to or resistant to them or to other herbicides by genetic manipulation or by mutation and selection. The herbicidal compounds of the present invention can, further, be used in conjunction with glyphosate, glufosinate, dicamba, imidazolinones, aryloxyphenoxypropionates or 2,4-D on glyphosate-tolerant, glufosinate-tolerant, dicamba-tolerant, imidazolinone-tolerant, aryloxyphenoxy-propionate tolerant or 2,4-D-tolerant crops. It is generally preferred to use the compounds of the invention in combination with herbicides that are selective for the crop being treated and which complement the spectrum of weeds controlled by these compounds at the application rate employed. It is further generally preferred to apply the compounds of the invention and other complementary herbicides at the same time, either as a combination formulation or as a tank mix. Similarly the herbicidal compounds of the present invention can be used in conjunction with acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors on acetolactate synthase inhibitor tolerant crops or with 4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) inhibitors on 4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor tolerant crops. The compounds of the present invention can generally be employed in combination with known herbicide safeners, such as benoxacor, benthiocarb, brassinolide, cloquintocet (mexyl), cyometrinil, cyprosulfamide, daimuron, dichlormid, dicyclonon, dietholate, dimepiperate, disulfoton, fenchlorazole-ethyl, fenclorim, flurazole, fluxofenim, furilazole, harpin proteins, isoxadifen-ethyl, mefenpyr-diethyl, mephenate, MG 191, MON 4660, naphthalic anhydride (NA), oxabetrinil, R29148 and N-phenyl-sulfonylbenzoic acid amides, to enhance their selectivity. They can additionally be employed to control undesirable vegetation in many crops that have been made tolerant to or resistant to them or to other herbicides by genetic manipulation or by mutation and selection. For example, corn, wheat, rice, soybean, sugar beet, cotton, canola, and other crops that have been made tolerant or resistant to compounds that are acetolactate synthase inhibitors in sensitive plants can be treated. Many glyphosate- and glufosinate-tolerant crops can be treated as well, alone or in combination with these herbicides. Some crops have been made tolerant to auxinic herbicides and ACCase herbicides such as 2,4-(dichlorophenoxy)acetic acid (2,4-D) and dicamba and aryloxyphenoxypropionates. These herbicides may be used to treat such resistant crops or other auxin tolerant crops. Some crops have been made tolerant to 4-hydroxyphenyl pyruvate dioxygenase inhibiting herbicides, and these herbicides may be used to treat such resistant crops. While it is possible to utilize the compounds of Formula IA or IB directly as herbicides, it is preferable to use them in mixtures containing an herbicidally effective amount of the compound along with at least one agriculturally acceptable adjuvant or carrier. Suitable adjuvants or carriers should not be phytotoxic to valuable crops, particularly at the concentrations employed in applying the compositions for selective weed control in the presence of crops, and should not react chemically with the compounds of Formula IA or IB or other composition ingredients. Such mixtures can be designed for application directly to weeds or their locus or can be concentrates or formulations that are normally diluted with additional carriers and adjuvants before application. They can be solids, such as, for example, dusts, granules, water dispersible granules, or wettable powders, or liquids, such as, for example, emulsifiable concentrates, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. They can also be provided as a pre-mix or tank mixed. Suitable agricultural adjuvants and carriers that are useful in preparing the herbicidal mixtures of the invention are well known to those skilled in the art. Some of these adjuvants include, but are not limited to, crop oil concentrate (mineral oil (85%)+emulsifiers (15%)); nonylphenol ethoxylate; benzylcocoalkyldimethyl quaternary ammonium salt; blend of petroleum hydrocarbon, alkyl esters, organic acid, and anionic surfactant; C9-C11 alkylpolyglycoside; phosphated alcohol ethoxylate; natural primary alcohol (C12-C16) ethoxylate; di-sec-butylphenol EO-PO block copolymer; polysiloxane-methyl cap; nonylphenol ethoxylate+urea ammonium nitrate; emulsified methylated seed oil; tridecyl alcohol (synthetic) ethoxylate (8EO); tallow amine ethoxylate (15 EO); PEG (400) dioleate-99. Liquid carriers that can be employed include water and organic solvents. The organic solvents typically used include, but are not limited to, petroleum fractions or hydrocarbons such as mineral oil, aromatic solvents, paraffinic oils, and the like; vegetable oils such as soybean oil, rapeseed oil, olive oil, castor oil, sunflower seed oil, coconut oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, linseed oil, palm oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, tung oil and the like; esters of the above vegetable oils; esters of monoalcohols or dihydric, trihydric, or other lower polyalcohols (4-6 hydroxy containing), such as 2-ethyl hexyl stearate, n-butyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, propylene glycol dioleate, di-octyl succinate, di-butyl adipate, di-octyl phthalate and the like; esters of mono, di and polycarboxylic acids and the like. Specific organic solvents include toluene, xylene, petroleum naphtha, crop oil, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexanone, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, ethyl acetate, amyl acetate, butyl acetate, propylene glycol monomethyl ether and diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, amyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerine, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, N,N-dimethyl alkylamides, dimethyl sulfoxide, liquid fertilizers and the like. Water is generally the carrier of choice for the dilution of concentrates. Suitable solid carriers include talc, pyrophyllite clay, silica, attapulgus clay, kaolin clay, kieselguhr, chalk, diatomaceous earth, lime, calcium carbonate, bentonite clay, Fuller's earth, cottonseed hulls, wheat flour, soybean flour, pumice, wood flour, walnut shell flour, lignin, and the like. It is usually desirable to incorporate one or more surface-active agents into the compositions of the present invention. Such surface-active agents are advantageously employed in both solid and liquid compositions, especially those designed to be diluted with carrier before application. The surface-active agents can be anionic, cationic or nonionic in character and can be employed as emulsifying agents, wetting agents, suspending agents, or for other purposes. Surfactants conventionally used in the art of formulation and which may also be used in the present formulations are described, inter alia, in “McCutcheon's Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual,” MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood, N.J., 1998 and in “Encyclopedia of Surfactants,” Vol. I-III, Chemical Publishing Co., New York, 1980-81. Typical surface-active agents include salts of alkyl sulfates, such as diethanolammonium lauryl sulfate; alkylarylsulfonate salts, such as calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate; alkylphenol-alkylene oxide addition products, such as nonylphenol-C18 ethoxylate; alcohol-alkylene oxide addition products, such as tridecyl alcohol-C16 ethoxylate; soaps, such as sodium stearate; alkylnaphthalene-sulfonate salts, such as sodium dibutyl-naphthalenesulfonate; dialkyl esters of sulfosuccinate salts, such as sodium di(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate; sorbitol esters, such as sorbitol oleate; quaternary amines, such as lauryl trimethylammonium chloride; polyethylene glycol esters of fatty acids, such as polyethylene glycol stearate; block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide; salts of mono and dialkyl phosphate esters; vegetable or seed oils such as soybean oil, rapeseed/canola oil, olive oil, castor oil, sunflower seed oil, coconut oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, linseed oil, palm oil, peanut oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, tung oil and the like; and esters of the above vegetable oils, particularly methyl esters. Oftentimes, some of these materials, such as vegetable or seed oils and their esters, can be used interchangeably as an agricultural adjuvant, as a liquid carrier or as a surface active agent. Other adjuvants commonly used in agricultural compositions include compatibilizing agents, antifoam agents, sequestering agents, neutralizing agents and buffers, corrosion inhibitors, dyes, odorants, spreading agents, penetration aids, sticking agents, dispersing agents, thickening agents, freezing point depressants, antimicrobial agents, and the like. The compositions may also contain other compatible components, for example, other herbicides, plant growth regulants, fungicides, insecticides, and the like and can be formulated with liquid fertilizers or solid, particulate fertilizer carriers such as ammonium nitrate, urea and the like. The concentration of the active ingredients in the herbicidal compositions of this invention is generally from about 0.001 to about 98 percent by weight. Concentrations from about 0.01 to about 90 percent by weight are often employed. In compositions designed to be employed as concentrates, the active ingredient is generally present in a concentration from about 5 to about 98 weight percent, preferably about 10 to about 90 weight percent. Such compositions are typically diluted with an inert carrier, such as water, before application. The diluted compositions usually applied to weeds or the locus of weeds generally contain about 0.0001 to about 1 weight percent active ingredient and preferably contain about 0.001 to about 0.05 weight percent. The present compositions can be applied to weeds or their locus by the use of conventional ground or aerial dusters, sprayers, and granule applicators, by addition to irrigation water or paddy flood water, and by other conventional means known to those skilled in the art. The following Examples are presented to illustrate the various aspects of this invention and should not be construed as limitations to the claims. EXAMPLES General: Microwave heating was carried out using a Biotage Initiator™ microwave reactor.

nutlets of the desired test plant species were planted in Sun Gro Metro-Mix® 360 planting mixture, which typically has a pH of 6.0 to 6.8 and an organic matter content of about 30 percent, in plastic pots with a surface area of 84.6 square centimeters (cm2). When required to ensure good germination and healthy plants, a fungicide treatment and/or other chemical or physical treatment was applied. The plants were grown for 7-31 days (d) in a greenhouse with an approximate 15 hour (h) photoperiod which was maintained at about 23-29° C. during the day and 22-28° C. during the night. Nutrients and water were added on a regular basis and supplemental lighting was provided with overhead metal halide 1000-Watt lamps as necessary. The plants were employed for testing when they reached the first or second true leaf stage. Treatments consisted of esters of compounds 33 and 39 and F and G. Compound F is methyl 6-amino-2-(4-chloro-2-fluoro-3-methoxyphenyl)-5-methoxypyrimidine-4-carboxylate; and compound G is methyl 4-amino-3-chloro-6-(4-chloro-2-fluoro-3-methoxyphenyl)picolinate. A weighed amount, determined by the highest rate to be tested, of each test compound was placed in a 25 mL glass vial and was dissolved in 4 mL of a 97:3 v/v (volume/volume) mixture of acetone and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to obtain concentrated stock solutions. If the test compound did not dissolve readily, the mixture was warmed and/or sonicated. The concentrated stock solutions obtained were diluted with 20 mL of an aqueous mixture containing acetone, water, isopropyl alcohol, DMSO, Atplus 411F crop oil concentrate, and Triton® X-155 surfactant in a 48.5:39:10:1.5:1.0:0.02 v/v ratio to obtain spray solutions containing the highest application rates. Additional application rates were obtained by serial dilution of 12 mL of the high rate solution into a solution containing 2 mL of a 97:3 v/v (volume/volume) mixture of acetone and DMSO and 10 mL of an aqueous mixture containing acetone, water, isopropyl alcohol, DMSO, Atplus 411F crop oil concentrate, and Triton® X-155 surfactant in a 48.5:39:10:1.5:1.0:0.02 v/v ratio to obtain ½×, ¼×, ⅛× and 1/16× rates of the high rate. Compound requirements are based upon a 12 mL application volume at a rate of 187 liters per hectare (L/ha). Formulated compounds were applied to the plant material with an overhead Mandel track sprayer equipped with 8002E nozzles calibrated to deliver 187 L/ha over an application area of 0.503 square meters (m2) at a spray height of 18 inches (43 cm) above the average plant canopy height. Control plants were sprayed in the same manner with the solvent blank. The treated plants and control plants were placed in a greenhouse as described above and watered by sub-irrigation to prevent wash-off of the test compounds. After 14 d, the condition of the test plants as compared with that of the untreated plants was determined visually and scored on a scale of 0 to 100 percent where 0 corresponds to no injury and 100 corresponds to complete kill. Some of the compounds tested, application rates employed, plant species tested, and results are given in Tables 3 and 4.

The prepared mud was dispensed in 250 mL aliquots into 480 mL non-perforated plastic pots with a surface area of 91.6 cm2 leaving a headspace of 3 cm in each pot. Rice seeds were planted in Sun Gro MetroMix 306 planting mixture, which typically has a pH of 6.0 to 6.8 and an organic matter content of about 30 percent, in plastic plug trays. Seedlings at the second or third leaf stage of growth were transplanted into 650 mL of mud contained in 960 mL non-perforated plastic pots with a surface area of 91.6 cm2 four days prior to herbicide application. The paddy was created by filling the 3 cm headspace of the pots with water. When required to ensure good germination and healthy plants, a fungicide treatment and/or other chemical or physical treatment was applied. The plants were grown for 4-14 d in a greenhouse with an approximate 14-h photoperiod which was maintained at about 29° C. during the day and 26° C. during the night. Nutrients were added as Osmocote (17:6:10, Nitrogen:Phosphorus:Potassium (N:P:K)+minor nutrients) at 2 grams (g) per cup. Water was added on a regular basis to maintain the paddy flood, and supplemental lighting was provided with overhead metal halide 1000-Watt lamps as necessary. The plants were employed for testing when they reached the second or third true leaf stage. Treatments consisted of esters of compounds 1-4, 6-33, 35-39, 41 and 42 and A-G.

Weighed amounts of technical grade compounds were placed in individual 120 mL glass vials and were dissolved in 20 mL of acetone to obtain concentrated stock solutions. If the test compound did not dissolve readily, the mixture was warmed and/or sonicated. The concentrated stock solutions obtained were diluted with 20 mL of an aqueous mixture containing 2.5% Agri-dex crop oil concentrate (v/v). The final application solutions contained 1.25% (v/v) Agri-dex crop oil concentrate. Generally, multiple concentrations were tested utilizing the same stock solution. Applications were made by injecting an appropriate amount of the application solution into the aqueous layer of the paddy. Control plants were treated in the same manner with the solvent blank. The treated plants and control plants were placed in a greenhouse as described above and water was added as needed to maintain a paddy flood. After 3 weeks the condition of the test plants, compared with that of the untreated plants, was determined visually and scored on a scale of 0 to 100 percent where 0 corresponds to no injury and 100 corresponds to complete kill.
