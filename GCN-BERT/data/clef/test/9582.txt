[Step 2] Synthesis of compound 11603
N-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-N-(4-(2-(2,2-difluoroacetyl)hydrazine-1-carbonyl)-2-fluorobenzyl)tetrahydro-2H-thiopyran-4-carboxamide 1,1-dioxide (0.170 g, 0.309 mmol), synthesized in step 1, and triethylamine (0.086 mL, 0.618 mmol) were dissolved in dichloromethane (15 mL) at room temperature, and methanesulfonyl chloride (0.036 mL, 0.464 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 2 hours. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The concentrate was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, 12 g cartridge; ethyl acetate/hexane = from 0% to 80%) and concentrated to give the title compound (0.015 g, 9.1%) as a white solid.
