TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to improving a nitrile hydratase (mutation) and its production method. Moreover, the present invention relates to genomic DNA that encodes the enzyme, a recombinant vector containing the genomic DNA, a transformant containing the recombinant vector, and a method for producing an amide compound. DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUND ART In recent years, a nitrile hydratase was found, which is an enzyme having nitrile hydrolysis activity that catalyses the hydration of a nitrile group to its corresponding amide group. Also, methods are disclosed to produce corresponding amide compounds from nitrile compounds using the enzyme or a microbial cell or the like containing the enzyme. Compared with conventional chemical synthetic methods, such methods are known by a high conversion or selectivity rate from a nitrile compound to a corresponding amide compound. Examples of microorganisms that produce a nitrile hydratase are the genus Corynebacterium, genus Pseudomonas, genus Rhodococcus, genus Rhizobium, genus Klebsiella, genus Pseudonocardia and the like. Among those, Rhodococcus rhodochrous strain J1 has been used for industrial production of acrylamides, and its usefulness has been verified. Furthermore, a gene encoding a nitrile hydratase produced by strain J1 has been identified (see patent publication 1). Meanwhile, introducing a mutation into a nitrile hydratase has been attempted not only to use a nitrile hydratase isolated from a naturally existing microorganism or its gene, but also to change its activity, substrate specificity, Vmax, Km, heat stability, stability in a substrate, stability in a subsequent product and the like of a nitrile hydratase. Regarding the nitrile hydratase in Pseudonocardia thermophila JCM 3095, from its conformational data, sites relating to the substrate specificity or thermal stability are anticipated, and mutant enzymes with modified substrate specificity were obtained (see patent publications 2˜4). Also, nitrile hydratase genes with improved heat resistance and amide-compound resistance have been produced by the inventors of the present invention (see patent publications 5˜9). To produce acrylamide for industrial applications using enzyme production methods, it is useful to develop a nitrile hydratase with improved catalytic activity when production costs such as catalyst costs are considered. Developing enzymes with improved activity is especially desired so as to achieve a reduction in the enzyme amount for reactions and in production costs or the like.

MODE TO CARRY OUT THE INVENTION In the following, the present invention is described in detail. 1. Nitrile Hydratase (a) Known Nitrile Hydratase The improved nitrile hydratase of the present invention is obtained by modifying a known nitrile hydratase and is not limited to being derived from any specific type. For example, those registered as nitrile hydratases in the GenBank database provided by the U.S. National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), or those described as nitrile hydratases in publications, may be referred to for a use. Examples of such nitrile hydratases are those described in patent publications 5˜9 (which are incorporated by reference in the present application). Nitrile hydratases in patent publications 5˜9 have heat resistance and acrylamide resistance, and by employing amino-acid substitutions according to the present invention, enhanced catalytic activity is further added to their properties. In particular, nitrile hydratases having amino-acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 53˜57 are listed as reference. Furthermore, by introducing a mutation from the gene encoding the amino-acid sequences described above using a well-known method, and by evaluating and screening mutant enzymes which have desired properties, improved enzymes with further enhanced activity are achieved. In particular, nitrile hydratases with amino-acid sequences shown in SEQ ID NOs: 58˜61 are listed. A “nitrile hydratase” has a conformation formed with α and β subunit domains, and contains a non-heme iron atom or a non-corrin cobalt atom as a prosthetic molecule. Such a nitrile hydratase is identified and referred to as an iron-containing nitrile hydratase or a cobalt-containing nitrile hydratase. An example of an iron-containing nitrile hydratase is such derived from Rhodococcus N-771 strain. The tertiary structure of such an iron-containing nitrile hydratase has been identified by X-ray crystal structural analysis. The enzyme is bonded with non-heme iron via four amino-acid residues in a cysteine cluster (Cys-Ser-Leu-Cys-Ser-Cys) (SEQ ID NO: 48) forming the active site of the α subunit. As for a cobalt-containing nitrile hydratase, examples are those derived from Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 strain (hereinafter may be referred to as “J1 strain”) or derived from Pseudonocardia thermophila. A cobalt-containing nitrile hydratase derived from the J1 strain is bound with a cobalt atom via a site identified as a cysteine cluster (Cys-Thr-Leu-Cys-Ser-Cys) (SEQ ID NO: 49) that forms the active site of the α subunit. In the cysteine cluster of a cobalt-containing nitrile hydratase derived from Pseudonocardia thermophila, cysteine (Cys) at position 4 from the upstream side (N-terminal side) of the cysteine cluster derived from the J1 strain is cysteine sulfinic acid (Csi), and cysteine (Cys) at position 6 from the furthermost downstream side (C-terminal side) of the cysteine cluster derived from the J1 strain is cysteine sulfenic acid (Cse). As described above, a prosthetic molecule is bonded with a site identified as cysteine clusters “C(S/T)LCSC” (SEQ ID NO: 48, 49) in the α subunit. Examples of a nitrile hydratase containing a binding site with such a prosthetic molecule are those that have amino-acid sequences and are encoded by gene sequences derived from the following: Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 (FERM BP-1478), Rhodococcus rhodochrous M8 (SU 1731814), Rhodococcus rhodochrous M33 (VKM Ac-1515D), Rhodococcus rhodochrous ATCC 39484 (JP 2001-292772), Bacillus smithii (JP H9-248188), Pseudonocardia thermophila (JP H9-275978), or Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius. On the other hand, the β-subunit is thought to be attributed to structural stability. For example, in the α subunit derived from Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 strain (FERM BP-1478), its amino-acid sequence is shown as SEQ ID NO: 4, and its base sequence is shown as SEQ ID NO: 3. Also, in the β subunit, its amino-acid sequence is shown as SEQ ID NO: 2, its base sequence is shown as SEQ ID NO: 1 and its accession number is “P21220.” In addition, in Rhodococcus rhodochrous M8 (SU 1731814), the accession number of the α subunit is “ATT 79340” and the accession number of the β subunit is “AAT 79339.” The accession number of the nitrile hydratase gene derived from Rhodococcus pyridinivorans MW3 is “AJ582605,” and the accession number of the nitrile hydratase gene derived from Rhodococcus pyridinivorans S85-2 is “AJ582605.” The nitrile hydratase gene of Rhodococcus ruber RH (CGMCC No. 2380) is described in CN 101463358. Moreover, the accession number of the nitrile hydratase gene derived from Nocardia YS-2002 is “X86737,” and the accession number of the nitrile hydratase gene derived from Nocardia sp. JBRs is “AY141130.” (b-1) Improved Nitrile Hydratase (β48) FIGS. 2-1 and 2-2 show the alignments of amino-acid sequences (in one-letter code) in β-subunits of known nitrile hydratases derived from various microorganisms. FIGS. 2-1 and 2-2 each show amino-acid sequences in sequence ID numbers 2, 5˜12, and 42˜47 of amino-acid sequences from the top. Furthermore, the improved nitrile hydratase of the present invention includes examples in which one or more (for example, 1˜10, preferred to be approximately 1˜5) amino-acid residues are deleted, substituted and/or added in the amino-acid sequences of known nitrile hydratases, excluding the amino-acid sequence identified as SEQ ID NO: 50. An example of the improved nitrile hydratase of the present invention has an amino-acid sequence identified as SEQ ID NO: 51 in the β subunit as shown in FIG. 3. Here, the amino-acid sequence shown as SEQ ID NO: 50 is located at positions 44˜52 counted from the N-terminal. According to an embodiment of the example above, in the improved nitrile hydratase that has the amino-acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 51, X1, X2, X3, X5, and X6 each independently indicate any amino-acid residue, and X4 is an amino acid selected from among cysteine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine, isoleucine, lysine, methionine, asparagine, proline, glutamine, serine and threonine. In addition, according to another embodiment, in the improved nitrile hydratase that has the amino-acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 51, X1, X3, X5, and X6 each independently indicate any amino-acid residue, X2 is S (serine), and X4 is an amino acid selected from among cysteine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine, isoleucine, lysine, methionine, asparagine, proline, glutamine, serine and threonine. Moreover, according to yet another embodiment, in the improved nitrile hydratase that has the amino-acid sequence as shown in SEQ ID NO: 51, X1 is I (isoleucine), X2 is S (serine), X3 is W (tryptophan), and X5 is K (lysine), X6 is S (serine), and X4 is an amino acid selected from among cysteine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine, isoleucine, lysine, methionine, asparagine, proline, glutamine, serine and threonine. Another example of the improved nitrile hydratase of the present invention is as follows: in the amino-acid sequence of a known nitrile hydratase identified as SEQ ID NO: 2, the amino-acid residue (tryptophan) at position 48 of the β subunit is substituted with cysteine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine, isoleucine, lysine, methionine, asparagine, proline, glutamine, serine or threonine. Modes of such amino-acid substitutions are denoted, for example, as Wβ48C, Wβ48D, Wβ48E, Wβ48H, Wβ48I, Wβ48K, Wβ48M, Wβ48N, Wβ48P, Wβ48Q, Wβ48S or Wβ48T. Amino acids are identified by a single-letter alphabetic code. The letter to the left of the numeral showing the number of amino-acid residues counted from the terminal to the substituted position (for example, “48”) represents the amino acid in a one-letter code before substitution, and the letter to the right represents the amino acid in a one-letter code after substitution. In particular, when the amino-acid sequence of the β subunit as shown in SEQ ID NO: 2 is denoted as “Wβ48C” in the improved nitrile hydratase, the abbreviation means that, in the amino-acid sequence of the β subunit (SEQ ID NO: 2), tryptophan (W) at position 48 counted from the N-terminal amino-acid residue (including the N-terminal amino-acid residue itself) is substituted with cysteine (C). Modes of amino acid substitutions in more preferred embodiments of the improved nitrile hydratase according to the present invention are shown as the following 1˜12: 1. Wβ48C, 2. Wβ48D, 3. Wβ48E, 4.

FIGS. 6-1 and 6-2 each show amino-acid sequences in sequence ID numbers 2, 5˜12, and 42˜49 of amino-acid sequences from the top. Furthermore, the improved nitrile hydratase of the present invention includes examples in which one or more (for example, 1˜10, preferred to be approximately 1˜5) amino-acid residues are deleted, substituted and/or added in the amino-acid sequences of known nitrile hydratases, excluding the amino-acid sequence identified as SEQ ID NO: 81. An example of the improved nitrile hydratase of the present invention has an amino-acid sequence identified as SEQ ID NO: 82 in the β subunit as shown in FIG. 7. Here, the amino-acid sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 81 is located at positions 29˜49 counted from the N-terminal.

In particular, when the amino-acid sequence of the β subunit (SEQ ID NO: 2) identified as SEQ ID NO: 2 is denoted as “Lβ37A” in the improved nitrile hydratase, the abbreviation means that, in the amino-acid sequence of the β subunit (SEQ ID NO: 2), leucine (L) at position 37 counted from the N-terminal amino-acid residue (including the N-terminal amino-acid residue itself) is substituted with alanine (A).

(b-6) Nitrile Hydratase Activity Among the activity properties of the improved nitrile hydratase according to the present invention, catalytic activity is improved relative to that in a nitrile hydratase before a mutation is introduced. Here, “nitrile hydratase activity” means an enzyme to catalyze the hydration for converting a nitrile compound to a corresponding amide compound (RCN+H2O→RCONH2). Determining the activity is conducted by bringing a nitrile compound as a substrate into contact with a nitrile hydratase for conversion to a corresponding amide compound and by determining the resultant amide compound. Any nitrile compound may be used as a substrate as long as nitrile hydratase reacts with such a compound, but acrylonitrile is preferred. Reaction conditions are a substrate concentration of 2.5%, reaction temperature of 10° C. to 30° C. and duration of 10˜30 minutes. The enzymatic reactions are terminated by adding phosphoric acid. Then, using HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) or gas chromatography, the produced acrylamide is analyzed to measure the amount of the amide compound. “Improved catalytic activity” means that when activity is measured in the culture of a transformant containing the improved nitrile hydratase or the improved nitrile hydratase isolated from the transformant, the catalytic activity of the improved nitrile hydratase is at least 10% higher than that of the parent strain measured under the same conditions. The parent strain in the present application means a transformant into which a template plasmid for mutation was introduced. As for an amide compound, an amide compound represented by the general formula (1) below, for example, is preferred. [in-line-formulae]R—CONH2 (1)[/in-line-formulae] (Here, R is an optionally substituted linear or branched alkyl or alkenyl group having 1˜10 carbon atoms, an optionally substituted cycloalkyl or allyl group having 3˜18 carbon atoms, or an optionally substituted saturated or unsaturated heterocyclic group.) Especially preferred is an acrylamide in which “R” in the formula is “CH2═CH—.” The above improved nitrile hydratase is obtained by performing amino-acid substitution on a nitrile hydratase. For example, such an improved nitrile hydratase is obtained by modifying the amino-acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 2) of a nitrile hydratase derived from Rhodococcus rhodocrous J1 strain, and by screening a nitrile hydratase with an improved catalytic activity. Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1 strain is internationally registered under accession number “FERM BP-1478” at the International Patent Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Central 6, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki), deposited Sep. 18, 1987. Using a nitrile hydratase derived from bacteria other than the J1 strain, catalytic activity is thought to be improved as well when a mutation is introduced by modifying a position, type of amino acid or DNA sequence described above. Preferred strains are: Rhodococcus rhodocrous M8 (SU 1731814) (SEQ ID NO: 5), Rhodococcus ruber TH (SEQ ID NO: 6), Rhodococcus rhodocrous M33 (VKM Ac-1515D), Rhodococcus pyridinivorans MW3 (SEQ ID NO: 7), Rhodococcus pyridinivorans S85-2 (SEQ ID NO: 8), Rhodococcus pyridinivorans MS-38 (SEQ ID NO: 9), Rhodococcus ruber RH (CN 101463358) (SEQ ID NO: 52), Nocardia sp. JBRs (SEQ ID NO: 10), Nocardia sp. YS-2002 (SEQ ID NO: 11), Rhodococcus rhodocrous ATCC 39384 (SEQ ID NO: 12), uncultured bacterium SP1 (SEQ ID NO: 42), uncultured bacterium BD2 (SEQ ID NO: 43), Comamonas testosterone (SEQ ID NO: 44), Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius Q6 (SEQ ID NO: 45), Pseudonocardia thermophila JCM 3095 (SEQ ID NO: 46), Rhodococcus rhodocrous Cr 4 (SEQ ID NO: 47), or the like. Obtained through natural mutation from the M8 strain above (SU 1731814), Rhodococcus rhodocrous M33 (VKM Ac-1515D) was selected because it is capable of constitutive expression of a nitrile hydratase. The amino-acid or gene sequence of the nitrile hydratase itself is not mutated (U.S. Pat. No. 5,827,699). In the β subunit in a bacterium listed above, the amino-acid residue at position 48 from the N-terminal of the improved nitrile hydratase is substituted with cysteine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine, isoleucine, lysine, methionine, asparagine, proline, glutamine, serine or threonine. Methods for conducting amino-acid substitution on a wild-type nitrile hydratase are as follows: a bacterium having nitrile hydratase activity is brought into contact for reactions with chemicals such as hydroxyl amine or nitrous acid as a mutation source; UV rays are irradiated to induce mutation; error-prone PCR or site-directed mutagenesis is employed to introduce a mutation at random into the gene that encodes a nitrile hydratase; and the like. (b-7) Error-Prone PCR To study functions and characteristics of proteins using a mutant, random mutagenesis is known. Random mutagenesis is a method to introduce a random mutation to the gene encoding a specific protein so that a mutant is produced. In random mutagenesis by PCR, stringency conditions are set low for the DNA amplification period so that a mutant base is introduced (error-prone PCR). In such an error-prone PCR method, a mutation is introduced randomly into any position of the entire DNA site to be amplified. Then, by examining the function of the obtained mutant, which occurred through the mutation introduced at a random site, information of the amino acid or domain important for a specific function of a protein is obtained. As a nitrile hydratase used for the template of error-prone PCR, the nitrile hydratase gene derived from a wild-type strain or DNA obtained as an amplified product by error-prone PCR is used. As reaction conditions for error-prone PCR, for example, a composition ratio of any one, two or three among dNTP (dGTP, dCTP, dATP or dTTP) in the reaction mix is reduced relative to another dNTP. In so setting, during the DNA synthesis, at a position that requires a dNTP whose ratio is reduced, another dNTP is more likely to be used by error and that may lead to mutation. In addition, other preferred reaction conditions are a composition in which the amount of MgCl2 and/or MnCl2 in the reaction mix is increased. (b-8) Improved Nitrile Hydratase Mutagenesis Based on a known nitrile hydratase gene, DNA that encodes such an improved nitrile hydtratase is produced by site-directed mutagenesis methods described in Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989), Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons (1987-1997) and the like. To introduce a mutation into DNA by well-known methods such as the Kunkel method or Gapped Duplex method, mutagenesis kits applying site-directed mutagenesis methods such as follows are used: QuickChange™ XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (made by Stratagene), GeneTailor™ Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (made by Invitrogen Corporation), TaKaRa Site-Directed Mutagenesis System (Mutan-K, Mutan-Super Express Km and the like, made by Takara Bio Inc.) and the like. Furthermore, the DNA related to the present invention includes DNA which is hybridized under stringent conditions with a DNA made up of a base sequence complementary to the base sequence of the DNA of the present invention, and which encodes a protein having nitrile hydratase activity. Such an improved nitrile hydratase DNA is obtained by introducing a mutation into a wild-type gene as described above. Alternatively, using the DNA sequence or its complementary sequence or a DNA fragment as a probe, improved nitrile hydratase DNA may also be obtained from cDNA libraries and genomic libraries by employing well-known hybridization methods such as colony hybridization, plaque hybridization, Southern blot or the like. Libraries constructed by a well-known method may be used, or commercially available cDNA libraries and genomic libraries may also be used. “Stringent conditions” are those for washing after hybridization; a salt concentration of 300˜2000 mM and a temperature of 40˜75° C., preferably a salt concentration of 600˜900 mM and a temperature of 65° C. For example, conditions 2×SSC at 50° C. may be employed. In addition to such a salt concentration of the buffer, temperature and the like, a person skilled in the art may set conditions for obtaining DNA that encodes a nitrile hydratase of the present invention by adding various conditions such as probe concentration, probe length and reaction time. For detailed procedures for hybridization, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd edition (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (1989)) or the like may be referred to. DNA to be hybridized includes DNA or its fragment, containing a base sequence which is at least 40%, preferably 60%, more preferably 90% or greater, homologous to the genomic DNA of the present invention. (c) Recombinant Vector, Transformant It is necessary for a nitrile hydratase gene to be put into a vector so that nitrile hydratase is expressed in the host organism to be transformed. Examples of such vectors are plasmid DNA, bacteriophage DNA, retrotransposon DNA, artificial chromosome DNA and the like. In addition, a host to be used in the present invention is not limited to any specific type as long as it can express the target nitrile hydratase after the recombinant vector is introduced into the host. Examples are bacteria such as E. coli and Bacillus subtilis, yeasts, animal cells, insect cells, plant cells and the like. When E. coli is used as a host, an expression vector with high expression efficiency, such as expression vector pkk 233-2 with a trc promoter (made by Amersham Biosciences Corp.), pTrc 99A (made by Amersham Biosciences Corp.) or the like, is preferred. In addition to a nitrile hydratase gene, a vector may be coupled with a promoter, terminator, enhancer, splicing signal, poly A addition signal, selection marker, ribosome binding sequence (SD sequence) or the like. Examples of selection markers are kanamycin resistance gene, dihydrofolate reductase gene, ampicillin resistance gene, neomycin resistance gene and the like. When a bacterium is used as a host, Escherichia coli may be used, for example, and a Rhodococcus strain such as Rhodococcus rhodochrous ATCC 12674, Rhodococcus rhodochrous ATCC 17895 and Rhodococcus rhodochrous ATCC 19140 may also be used. Those ATCC strains are obtained from the American type culture collection. When E. coli is used as a host for producing a transformant to express a nitrile hydratase, since most of the expressed nitrile hydratase is formed as an inclusion body and is insoluble, a transformant with low catalytic activity is obtained. On the other hand, if a Rhodococcus strain is used as a host, nitrile hydratase is present in the soluble fraction, and a transformant with high activity is obtained. Those transformants may be selected based on purposes. However, when an improved enzyme is selected under stringent conditions, a transformant with high activity derived from a Rhodococcus strain is preferred. Introducing a recombinant vector into a bacterium is not limited to any specific method as long as DNA is introduced into the bacterium. For example, a method using calcium ions, electroporation or the like may be employed. When yeast is used as a host, examples are Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Pichia pastoris and the like. As a method for introducing a recombinant vector into yeast, it is not limited specifically as long as DNA is introduced into the yeast. For example, an electroporation method, spheroplast method, lithium acetate method or the like may be employed. When animal cells are used as a host, monkey cells COS-7, Vero, CHO cells, mouse L cells, rat GH3 cells, human FL cells or the like may be employed. As a method for introducing a recombinant vector into animal cells, for example, an electroporation method, calcium phosphate method, lipofection method or the like may be used. When insect cells are used as a host, Sf9 cells, Sf21 cells or the like may be used. A method for introducing a recombinant vector into insect cells, for example, a calcium phosphate method, lipofection method, electroporation method or the like may be used. When plant cells are used as a host, tobacco BY-2 cells or the like may be used. However, that is not the only option. A method for introducing a recombinant vector into plant cells, for example, an Agrobacterium method, particle gun method, PEG method, electroporation method or the like may be used. (d) Method for Producing Culture and Improved Nitrile Hydratase An improved nitrile hydratase of the present invention is obtained by incubating the above transformant and by collecting from the obtained culture. The present invention also relates to a method for producing an improved nitrile hydratase, and the method is characterized by collecting an improved nitrile hydratase from the culture above. In the present invention, “culture” means any of culture supernatant, cell cultured cell, bacterial-cell culture, and cell homogenates or bacterial-cell homogenates. To incubate a transformant of the present invention, a generally used method for incubating a host is used. The target nitrile hydratase is accumulated in the culture. As for a culture to incubate a transformant of the present invention, a natural or synthetic culture medium is used as long as it contains a carbon source, a nitrogen source, inorganic salts or the like for the host bacteria to assimilate, and incubation of a transformant is performed efficiently. Examples of a carbon source are carbohydrates such as glucose, galactose, fructose, sucrose, raffinose and starch; organic acids such as acetic acid and propionic acid; alcohols such as ethanol and propanol; and the like. Examples of a nitrogen source are inorganic acids such as ammonia, ammonium chloride, ammonium sulfate, ammonium acetate and ammonium phosphate; ammonium salts of organic acids; and other nitrogen-containing compounds. In addition, peptone, yeast extract, meat extract, corn steep liquor, various amino acids or the like may also be used. Examples of minerals are monopotassium phosphate, potassium dihydrogenphosphate, magnesium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride, ferrous sulfate, manganese sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, calcium carbonate and the like. Also, if necessary, a defoaming agent may be used to prevent foaming during the incubation process. Moreover, cobalt ions or iron ions as prosthetic molecules of a nitrile hydratase, or nitriles and amides as an inducer of the enzyme, may also be added to the culture. Incubation may be conducted by adding selective pressure to prevent the vector and the target gene from being eliminated. Namely, if a selection marker is a drug-resistant gene, a corresponding chemical agent may be added; or if a selection marker is an auxotrophic complementary gene, corresponding nutrition factors may be removed. Also, if a selection marker has a genetic assimilation trait, an equivalent assimilation factor may be added as a sole factor if necessary. For example, when E. coli transformed by a vector containing an ampicillin-resistant gene is incubated, ampicillin may be added as needed during the incubation process. When incubating a transformant transformed by an expression vector containing an inducible promoter, such an inducer may be added to the culture if necessary. For example, when incubating a transformant transformed by an expression vector with a promoter inducible with isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), IPTG or the like may be added to the culture. Likewise, when incubating a transformant transformed by an expression vector with a trp promoter inducible with indoleacetic acid (IAA), IAA or the like may be added to the culture. Incubation conditions of a transformant are not limited specifically as long as the productivity of the target nitrile hydratase and growth of the host are not prohibited. Generally, conditions are preferred to be 10° C.˜40° C., more preferably 20° C.˜37° C., for 5˜100 hours. The pH value is adjusted using inorganic or organic acid, alkaline solution or the like. If it is an E. coli, the pH is adjusted to be 6˜9. As for incubation methods, solid-state culture, static culture, shaking culture, aeration-agitation culture and the like may be used. When an E. coli transformant is incubated, it is especially preferred to use shaking culture or aeration-agitation culture (jar fermentation) under aerobic conditions. When incubated in culture conditions above, the improved nitrile hydratase of the present invention is accumulated at a high yield in the above culture medium, namely, at least in any of culture supernatant, cell culture, bacterial-cell culture, cell homogenates or bacterial-cell homogenates. When an improved nitrile hydratase is incubated and produced in a cell or bacterial cell, the target nitrile hydratase is collected by homogenizing the cells or bacterial cells. Cells or bacterial cells are homogenized by high-pressure treatment using a French press or homogenizer, supersonic treatment, grinding treatment using glass beads or the like, enzyme treatment using lysozyme, cellulose, pectinase and the like, freezing and thawing treatment, hypotonic solution treatment, bacteriolysis induction treatment by phage, and so on. After the homogenization process, residues of cell homogenates or bacterial-cell homogenates (including insoluble fractions of the cell extract) are removed if necessary. To remove residues, centrifugal or filtration methods are employed. To increase the efficiency of removing residues, a coagulant or filter aid may be used. The supernatant obtained after the removal of residues is soluble fractions of the cell extract, which are used as a crudely purified improved nitrile hydratase solution. Also, when an improved nitrile hydratase is produced in a bacterial cell or in cells, it is an option to collect the bacterial cell or the cells themselves by a centrifuge or membrane filtration and to use without homogenizing them. When an improved nitrile hydratase is produced outside cells or bacterial cells, the culture may be used as is, or the cells or bacterial cells are removed using a centrifugal or filtration method. Then, the improved nitrile hydratase is collected from the culture by being extracted through ammonium sulfate precipitation, if necessary. Furthermore, dialysis or various chromatography techniques (gel filtration, ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, etc.) may be used to isolate and purify the nitrile hydratase. To check the production yield of a nitrile hydratase obtained by incubating a transformant is not limited to using any specific method, but SDS-PAGE (polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis), nitrile hydratase activity measurements or the like may be used to determine the yield per culture, per wet or dry weight in a bacterial cell, or per crude enzymatic protein. SDS-PAGE may be conducted by a method well known by a person skilled in the art. Also, the activity described above may be applied to nitrile hydratase activity. Without using any living cells, an improved nitrile hydratase of the present invention may be produced using a cell-free protein synthesis system. In a cell-free protein synthesis system, a protein is produced in an artificial vessel such as a test tube using a cell extract. A cell-free protein synthesis system used in the present application includes a cell-free transcription system that synthesizes RNA using DNA as a template. In such a case, an organism corresponding to the above host is the organism from which the cell extract is derived. Here, for the cell extract, extracts of eukaryotic or prokaryotic origin, such as the extract from wheat germ, E. coli and the like, may be used. Such cell extracts may be concentrated or not. The cell extract is obtained by ultrafiltration, dialysis, polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation or the like. In the present invention, a commercially available kit may also be used for cell-free protein synthesis. Examples of such a kit are a reagent kit PROTEIOS™ (Toyobo), TNT™ system (Promega KK), a synthesizer PG-Mate™ (Toyobo), RTS (Roche Diagnostics) and the like. An improved nitrile hydratase obtained by cell-free protein synthesis as described above is also purified by properly selecting a chromatography type. 2. Method for Producing Amide Compound The improved nitrile hydratase obtained above is used as an enzymatic catalyst for material production. For example, an amide compound is produced by bringing a nitrile compound into contact with the improved nitrile hydratase. Then, the amide compound produced upon contact is collected. Accordingly, an amide compound is produced. The isolated and purified nitrile hydratase as described above is used as an enzymatic catalyst. In addition, a gene is introduced so as to express an improved nitrile hydratase in a proper host as described above and the culture after the host is incubated or the processed products of the culture may also be used. Processed products are, for example, incubated cells immobilized with acrylamide gel or the like, those processed by glutaraldehyde, those supported by inorganic carriers such as alumina, silica, zeolite, diatomaceous earth and the like. Here, “contact” means that an improved nitrile hydratase and a nitrile compound are present in the same reaction system or incubation system: for example, an isolated and purified improved nitrile hydratase and a nitrile compound are mixed; a nitrile compound is added into a incubation vessel of a cell to express an improved nitrile hydratase gene; cells are incubated in the presence of a nitrile compound; a cell extract is mixed with a nitrile compound; and so on. A nitrile compound as a substrate is selected by considering the substrate specificity of the enzyme, stability of the enzyme in the substrate and the like. As for a nitrile compound, acrylonitrile is preferred. The reaction method and the method for collecting an amide compound after the completion of reactions are properly selected depending on the characteristics of the substrate and the enzymatic catalyst. The enzymatic catalyst is preferred to be recycled as long as its activity is not deactivated. From the viewpoint of preventing deactivation and of recycling ease, the enzymatic catalyst is preferred to be used as a processed product. EXAMPLES In the following, examples of the present invention are described in detail. However, the present invention is not limited to those. Rhodococcus rhodocrous J1 strain is registered under accession number “FERM BP-1478” at the International Patent Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Central 6, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki), deposited Sep. 18, 1987. Preparation Example 1 Preparation of Plasmid pSJ034 As a template to perform the amino-acid substitution of the present invention, plasmid pSJ034 (FIG. 1) having the nitrile hydratase gene of the J1 strain was produced by the following method. Plasmid pSJ034 is capable of expressing nitrile hydratase in a Rhodococcus strain. Plasmid pSJ034 was produced from pSJ023 by the method disclosed in JP publication H10-337185. Namely, partially cleaved at the XbaI site and ligated with the Sse8387I linker, plasmid pSJ033 was prepared so that one XbaI site of plasmid pSJ023 was substituted with Sse8387I. Next, plasmid pSJ033 was partially cleaved at the Sse8387I site, and a Klenow fragment was used to blunt the ends so as to cause self ligation. Accordingly, plasmid pSJ034 was obtained. Here, pSJ023 is a transformant “R. rhodochrous ATCC 12674/pSJ023,” and is internationally registered under accession number “FERM BP-6232” at the International Patent Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Central 6, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki), deposited Mar. 4, 1997. Preparation Example 2 Preparation of Plasmid pFR005 (1) Construction of Mutant Gene Library As for a template plasmid, pER855A (FIG. 5) was used, prepared by modifying plasmid pER855 (see JP publication 2010-172295) as follows: counted downstream from the N-terminal amino-acid residue of the amino-acid sequence (SEQ ID NO: 2) in the β subunit, an amino-acid residue at position 167 was mutated from asparagine (N) to serine (S); an amino-acid residue at position 219 was mutated from valine (V) to alanine (A); an amino-acid residue at position 57 was mutated from serine (S) to methionine (M); an amino-acid residue at position 114 was mutated from lysine (K) to tyrosine (Y); and an amino-acid residue at position 107 was mutated from threonine (T) to lysine (K). First, introduction of a mutation into the nitrile hydratase gene was conducted as follows: <Composition of PCR Reaction Mixture> sterile water 20 μL pER855A (1 ng/mL) 1 μL Forward primer (10 mM) 2 μL Reverse primer (10 mM) 2 μL PrimeSTAR MAX (2×) 25 μL total 50 μL <PCR Reaction Conditions> (98° C. for 10 sec, 55° C. for 5 sec, 72° C. for 90 sec)×30 cycles <primers> primers for saturation mutagenesis at β17 (SEQ ID NO: 63) β17RM-F: ggatacggaccggtcNNStatcagaaggacgag (SEQ ID NO: 64) β17RM-R: ctcgtccttctgataSNNgaccggtccgtatcc <Reaction Conditions> (94° C. for 30 sec, 65° C. for 30 sec, 72° C. for 3 min)×30 cycles After the completion of PCR, 5 μL of the reaction mixture was provided for 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis, an amplified fragment of 11 kb was confirmed, and 1 DpnI (provided with the kit) was added to the PCR reaction mixture, which was then reacted at 37° C. for an hour. Accordingly, the template plasmid was removed. After that, the reaction mixture was purified using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega KK), and transformation was introduced into JM109 using the purified PCR reaction product. A few thousand obtained colonies were collected from the plate, and plasmid DNA was extracted using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen) to construct a mutant gene library. (2) Producing Rhodococcus Transformant The cells of Rhodococcus rhodochrous strain ATCC 12674 at a logarithmic growth phase were collected by a centrifugal separator, washed with ice-cooled sterile water three times and suspended in the sterile water. Then, 1 μL of plasmid prepared in (2) above and 10 μL of the bacterial-cell suspension were mixed and ice-cooled. The plasmid DNA and the bacterial-cell suspension were supplied into a cuvette, and electric pulse treatment was conducted at 2.0 KV and 200Ω using an electroporation device, Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). The cuvette with the mixture processed by electric pulse was let stand for 10 minutes under ice-cold conditions, and a heat-shock treatment was conducted at 37° C. for 10 minutes. Then, 500 μL of an MYK culture medium (0.5% polypeptone, 0.3% Bacto yeast extract, 0.3% Bacto malt extract, 0.2% K2HPO4, 0.2% KH2PO4) was added and let stand at 30° C. for 5 hours, and the strain was then applied on an MYK agar medium containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin. The colony obtained after being incubated at 30° C. for 3 days was used as a transformant. In the same manner, transformant pER 855A was prepared as a comparative strain. (3) Amide Treatment on Rhodococcus Strain Transformant The Rhodococcus transformant containing nitrile hydratase gene, obtained in (2) above and ATCC 12674/pER855A as a comparative strain were used for screening. In a 96-hole deep-well plate, 1 mL each of a GGPK culture medium (1.5% glucose, 1% sodium glutamate, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.05% K2HPO4, 0.05% KH2P O4, 0.05% MgSO4.7H2O, 1% CoCl2, 0.1% urea, 50 μg/mL kanamycin, pH 7.2) was supplied. In each culture medium, the above strain was inoculated, and subjected to liquid culture at 30° C. for 3 days. Next, 30 μL of the liquid culture obtained above was dispensed in a 96-hole plate and the culture medium was removed by centrifugation. Lastly, 40 μL of a 50% acrylamide solution was added to suspend the bacteria. The transformant suspended in a high-concentration acrylamide solution was put in an incubator to completely deactivate the comparative strain through heat treatment conducted at 50° C. for 30 minutes. The remaining nitrile hydratase activity was measured as follows. First, after the acrylamide treatment, a transformant was washed with a 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and the activity was measured by the following method. The washed transformant and 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) were supplied to a test tube and preincubated at 30° C. for 10 minutes, and an equivalent volume of a 5% acrylonitrile solution (pH 7.0) was added and reacted for 10 minutes. Then, one tenth volume of 1 M phosphoric acid was added to terminate the reaction. Next, the transformant was removed from the terminated reaction mixture by centrifugation, and the mixture was diluted to a proper concentration for analysis by HPLC (WAKOSIL 5C8 (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) 250 mm long, 10% acetonitrile containing 5 mM phosphoric acid, flow rate of mobile phase at 1 mL/min, wavelength of a UV absorption detector 260 nm). Using untreated cells for which acrylamide treatment was not conducted, activity was measured for comparison. Then, based on the obtained activity values, the remaining activity after acrylamide treatment was determined. Among hundreds of transformants containing a mutant nitrile hydratase gene obtained above, mutant enzyme pFR005 showing resistance to a high-concentration acrylamide was selected. (4) Confirming Base Sequence To confirm the base sequence of the nitrile hydratase gene, plasmid was recovered from the selected strains. Rhodococcus transformants were inoculated in 10 mL of an MYK culture medium (0.5% polypeptone, 0.3% Bacto yeast extract, 0.3% malt extract, 1% glucose, 50 μg/mL kanamycin) and incubated for 24 hours, and a 20% sterile glycine solution was added to make the final concentration of 2%, and further incubated for another 24 hours. Then, the bacterial cells were recovered by centrifugation, washed with a TES buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8)-10 mM NaCl-1 mM EDTA), suspended in 2 mL of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH8)-12.5% sucrose-100 mM NaCl-1 mg/mL lysozyme, and subjected to shaking culture at 37° C. for 3 hours. Then, 0.4 mL of 10% SDS was added and the mixture was shaken gently for an hour at room temperature, to which 2.1 mL of 5 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.2) was added and let stand in ice for an hour. Next, the mixture was centrifuged for an hour at 10,000×g at 4° C. to obtain a supernatant, to which a 5-times volume ethanol was added and let stand at −20° C. for 30 minutes. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000×g for 20 minutes. The precipitate was washed with 10 mL of 70% ethanol and dissolved in 100 μL of a TE buffer. Accordingly, a DNA solution was obtained. Next, the sequence including nitrile hydratase was amplified by a PCR method. <Composition of PCR Reaction Mixture> template plasmid 1 μL 10× PCR buffer (made by NEB) 10 μL primer NH-19 (50 μM) 1 μL primer NH-20 (50 μM) 1 μL 2.5 mM dNTPmix 8 μL sterile water 79 μL Taq DNA polymerase (made by NEB) 1 μL <primers> (SEQ ID NO: 65) NH-19: GCCTCTAGATATCGCCATTCCGTTGCCGG (SEQ ID NO: 66) NH-20: ACCCTGCAGGCTCGGCGCACCGGATGCCCAC <Reaction Conditions> (94° C. for 30 sec, 65° C. for 30 sec, 72° C. for 3 min)×30 cycles After completion of PCR, 5 μL of the reaction mixture was subjected to 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis to detect a 2.5 kb PCR amplified product. After Exo-SAP treatment (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) on the PCR reaction mixture, samples for alignment analysis were prepared by a cycle sequencing method, and were analyzed using CEQ-2000XL (Beckman Coulter). As a result, the mutation positions of pFR005 were confirmed to be Nβ167S, Vβ219A, Sβ57M, Kβ114Y, Tβ107K and Pβ17 G. Namely, in plasmid pFR005, proline at position 17 in the β subunit was mutated to glycine, serine at position 57 in the β subunit was mutated to lysine, tyrosine at position 107 in the β subunit was mutated to lysine, lysine at position 114 in the β subunit was mutated to tyrosine, asparagine at position 167 in the β subunit was mutated to serine, and valine at position 219 in the β subunit was mutated to alanine.

Then, 1 μL of DpnI (provided in the kit) was added to the PCR reaction mixture and reacted at 37° C. for an hour to remove the template plasmid. After the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was purified using Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (made by Promega KK), and the purified PCR product was used to transform JM109. From the obtained culture, plasmid DNA was extracted using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (made by Qiagen), and the base sequence of the nitrile hydratase was confirmed using automated sequencer CEQ 8000 (made by Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Obtained plasmids were named as follows.

Then, 1 μL of plasmid prepared in example 1 and 10 μL of the bacterial-cell suspension were mixed and ice-cooled. The DNA and the bacterial-cell suspension were supplied in a cuvette, and electric pulse treatment was conducted using an electroporation device, Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad Laboratories), under conditions of 2.0 kV and 200Ω. The electric-pulse processed mixture was let stand in an ice-cold condition for 10 minutes, and subjected to heat shock at 37° C. for 10 minutes. After 500 μL of an MYK culture medium (0.5% polypeptone, 0.3% Bacto yeast extract, 0.3% Bacto malt extract, 0.2% K2HPO4, 0.2% KH2PO4) was added and let stand at 30° C. for 5 hours, the strain was applied onto an MYK agar culture medium containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin and incubated at 30° C. for 3 days. The obtained colony after incubating at 30° C. for 3 days was used as a transformant. Each transformant obtained above was inoculated into an MYK culture medium (50 μg/mL kanamycin), and subjected to shaking culture at 30° C. for 2 days. Then, 1% culture was inoculated into a GGPK culture medium (1.5% glucose, 1% sodium glutamate, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.05% K2HPO4, 0.05% KH2P O4, 0.05% Mg2O4.7H2O, 1% CoCl2, 0.1% urea, 50 μg/mL kanamycin, pH 7.2), and subjected to shaking culture at 30° C. for 3 days. Bacterial cells were collected by using a centrifuge, and were washed with a 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) to prepare a bacterial-cell suspension. Example 3 Improved Nitrile Hydratase Activity The nitrile hydratase activity in the obtained bacterial-cell suspension was measured by the following method: 0.2 mL of the bacterial-cell mixture and 4.8 mL of a 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) were mixed, to which 5 mL of a 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5.0% (w/v) acrylonitrile was further added. Next, the mixture was reacted while being shaken at 10° C. for 10 minutes. Then, bacterial cells were filtered and the amount of produced acrylamide was determined using gas chromatography. <Analysis Conditions> analysis instrument: gas chromatograph GC-14B (Shimadzu Corporation) detector: FID (detection at 200° C.) column: 1 m glass column filled with PoraPak PS (column filler made by Waters Corp.) column temperature: 190° C. Nitrile hydratase activity was determined by conversion from the amount of acrylamide. Here, regarding nitrile hydratase activity, the amount of enzyme to produce 1 μmol of acrylamide per 1 minute is set as 1 U. Table 7 shows relative activities when the parent strain activity without amino-acid substitution was set at 1.0.

Namely, using the method in example 1, each of the improved nitrile hydratases with a substituted amino acid were prepared, and a transformant was obtained by the method in example 2. Further, the enzymatic activity was measured by the same method in example 3. The results are shown in Table 8.

Example 5 SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis Using a sonicator VP-300 (TAITEC Corporation), the bacterial-cell suspension prepared in example 2 was homogenized for 10 minutes while being ice-cooled. Next, the bacterial-cell homogenate was centrifuged at 13500 rpm for 30 minutes and a cell-free extract was obtained from the supernatant. After the protein content of the cell extract was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit, the cell extract was mixed with a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% w/v SDS, 12% v/v β mercaptoethanol, 20% v/v glycerol, and a trace of bromophenol blue), and boiled for 5 minutes for denaturation. A 10% acrylamide gel was prepared and denatured samples were applied to have an equivalent protein mass per one lane to conduct electrophoresis analysis (FIG. 4). As a result, since hardly any difference was observed in the band strength of nitrile hydratase in all the samples, the expressed amount of nitrile hydratase was found to be the same. Accordingly, the enzymatic specific activity was found to be attributed to the improved enzymatic activity. Example 6 Preparation of Transformant Containing Nitrile Hydratase Derived from Rhodococcus Rhodocrous M8 Strain (Hereinafter Referred to as M8 Strain) (1) Preparation of Chromosomal DNA from M8 Strain The M8 strain (SU 1731814) is obtained from the Russian Institute of Microorganism Biochemistry and Physiology (VKPM S-926). In 100 mL of an MYK culture medium (0.5% polypeptone, 0.3% Bacto yeast extract, 0.3% Bacto malt extract, 0.2% K2HPO4, 0.2% KH2PO4, pH 7.0), the M8 strain was subjected to shaking culture at 30° C. for 72 hours. The culture mixture was centrifuged, and the collected bacterial cells were suspended in 4 mL of a Saline-EDTA solution (0.1 M EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 8.0). Then, 8 mg of lysozyme was added to the suspension, which was shaken at 37° C. for 1˜2 hours and was frozen at −20° C. Next, 10 mL of Tris-SDS solution (1% SDS, 0.1M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0)) was added to the suspension while the suspension was gently shaken. Proteinase K (Merck KGaA) was further added (final concentration of 0.1 mg) and shaken at 37° C. for 1 hour. Next, an equivalent volume of TE saturated phenol was added, agitated (TE: 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)) and then centrifuged. The supernatant was collected and a double volume of ethanol was added and DNA strands were wrapped around a glass rod. Then, the phenol was removed through centrifugation by successively adding 90%, 80%, and 70% ethanol. Next, the DNA was dissolved in a 3 mL TE buffer, to which a Ribonuclease A solution (processed at 100° C. for 15 minutes) was added to have a 10 μg/mL concentration and shaken at 37° C. for 30 minutes. Proteinase K (Merck KGaA) was further added and shaken at 37° C. for 30 minutes. After an equivalent volume of TE saturated phenol was added and centrifuged, the mixture was separated into upper and lower layers. An equivalent volume of TE saturated phenol was further added to the upper layer and centrifuged to separate into upper and lower layers. Such a process was repeated. Then, an equivalent volume of chloroform (containing 4% isoamyl alcohol) was added, centrifuged and the upper layer was collected. Then, a double volume of ethanol was added to the upper layer and the DNA strands were collected by wrapping them around a glass rod. Accordingly, chromosomal DNA was obtained. (2) Using PCR, Preparation of Improved Nitrile Hydratase from Chromosomal DNA Derived from M8 Strain The nitrile hydratase derived from the M8 strain is described in a non-patent publication (Veiko, V. P. et al., “Cloning, Nucleotide Sequence of Nitrile Hydratase Gene from Rhodococcus rhodochrous M8,” Russian Biotechnology (Mosc.) 5, 3-5 (1995)). The sequences of β subunit, α subunit and activator are respectively identified in SEQ ID NOs: 37, 38 and 39. Based on the sequence information, primers of SEQ ID numbers 40 and 41 in the sequence listing were synthesized and PCR was performed using the chromosomal DNA prepared in step (1) above as a template. <Composition of PCR Reaction Mixture> sterile water 20 μL template DNA (chromosomal DNA) 1 μL primer M8-1 (10 mM) 2 μL primer M8-2 (10 mM) 2 μL PrimeSTAR MAX (2×) 25 μL total 50 μL <primers> (SEQ ID NO: 40) M8-1: GGTCTAGAATGGATGGTATCCACGACACAGGC (SEQ ID NO: 41) M8-2: cccctgcaggtcagtcgatgatggccatcgattc <Reaction Conditions> (98° C. for 10 sec, 55° C. for 5 sec, 72° C. for 30 sec)×30 cycles After the completion of PCR, 5 μL of the reaction mixture was subjected to 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis (0.7 wt. % Agarose I, made by Dojin Chemical Co., Ltd.) and an amplified fragment of 1.6 kb was detected. The reacted mixture was purified using Wizard SV gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega KK). Next, the collected PCR product was coupled with a vector (pUC118/Hinc II site) using a ligation kit (made by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) so that competent cells of E. coli JM109 were transformed using the reaction mixture. A few clones from the obtained transformant colony were inoculated into 1.5 mL of an LB-Amp culture medium, and incubated at 37° C. for 12 hours while being shaken. After incubation was finished, the bacterial cells were collected from the culture through centrifugation. Plasmid DNA was extracted from the collected bacterial cells using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). The base sequence of nitrile hydratase in the obtained plasmid DNA was confirmed using a sequencing kit and automated sequencer CEQ 8000 (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) (SEQ ID NO: 62). Next, the obtained plasmid DNA was cleaved with restriction enzymes XbaI and Sse8387I, and subjected to 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis so as to collect a nitrile hydratase gene fragment (1.6 kb), which was then inserted into XbaI-Sse8387I site of plasmid pSJ042. The obtained plasmid was named pSJ-N01A. Here, pSJ042 as a plasmid capable of expressing nitrile hydratase in Rhodococcus J1 strain was prepared by a method described in JP publication 2008-154552 (the content is incorporated in this application by reference). Plasmid pSJ023 used for preparation of pSJ042 is registered as transformant ATCC 12674/pSJ023 (FERM BP-6232) at the International Patent Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Central 6, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki), deposited Mar. 4, 1997. Example 7 Preparation and Evaluation of Improved Nitrile Hydratase Using plasmid pSJ-N01A obtained in example 6, the amino acid at position 48 of the β subunit was substituted. The same method in example 1 was employed for amino-acid substitution to prepare an improved nitrile hydratase. Next, using the same method in example 3, a transformant of Rhodococcus rhodocrous ATCC 12674 strain and its bacterial-cell suspension were prepared. Then, the enzymatic activity was measured by the same method as in example 4. The results are shown in Table 9.

The reacted mixture was purified using Wizard SV gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega), and JM109 was transformed using the purified PCR reaction product. Then, a plasmid DNA was extracted from the obtained culture using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen), and the base sequence of the nitrile hydratase was confirmed using an automated sequencer CEQ 8000 (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) Obtained plasmids were named as shown in Table 11.

Then, 1 μL of plasmid prepared in example 1 and 10 μL of the bacterial-cell suspension were mixed and ice-cooled. The DNA and the bacterial-cell suspension were supplied in a cuvette, and electric pulse treatment was conducted using an electroporation device, Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad Laboratories), under conditions of 2.0 kV and 200Ω. The electric-pulse processed mixture was let stand in an ice-cold condition for 10 minutes, and subjected to heat shock at 37° C. for 10 minutes. After 500 μL of an MYK culture medium (0.5% polypeptone, 0.3% Bacto yeast extract, 0.3% Bacto malt extract, 0.2% K2HPO4, 0.2% KH2PO4) was added and let stand at 30° C. for 5 hours, and applied onto an MYK agar culture medium containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin and incubated at 30° C. for 3 days. The obtained colony after incubating at 30° C. for 3 days was used as a transformant. Each transformant obtained above was inoculated into an MYK culture medium (50 μg/mL kanamycin), and subjected to shaking culture at 30° C. for 2 days. Then, 1% culture was each inoculated into a GGPK culture medium (1.5% glucose, 1% sodium glutamate, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.05% K2HPO4, 0.05% KH2PO4, 0.05% Mg2O4.7H2O, 1% CoCl2, 0.1% urea, 50 μg/mL kanamycin, pH 7.2), and shaking culture was performed at 30° C. for 3 days. Bacterial cells were collected by using a centrifuge and were washed with a 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) to prepare a bacterial-cell suspension. Example 10 Improved Nitrile Hydratase Activity The nitrile hydratase activity in the obtained bacterial-cell suspension was measured by the following method: 0.2 mL of the bacterial-cell mixture and 4.8 mL of a 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) were mixed, to which 5 mL of a 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5.0% (w/v) acrylonitrile was further added.

Example 17 Preparation of Transformant Containing Nitrile Hydratase Derived from Rhodococcus Rhodocrous M8 Strain (Hereinafter Referred to as M8 Strain) (1) Preparation of Chromosomal DNA from M8 Strain The M8 strain (SU 1731814) is obtained from Russian Institute of Microorganism Biochemistry and Physiology (VKPM S-926). In a 100 mL MYK culture medium (0.5% polypeptone, 0.3% Bacto yeast extract, 0.3% Bacto malt extract, 0.2% K2HPO4, 0.2% KH2PO4, pH 7.0), the M8 strain was subjected to shaking culture at 30° C. for 72 hours. The culture mixture was centrifuged, and the collected bacterial cells were suspended in 4 mL of Saline-EDTA solution (0.1 M EDTA, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 8.0). Then, 8 mg of lysozyme was added to the suspension, which was shaken at 37° C. for 1˜2 hours and was frozen at −20° C. Next, 10 mL of Tris-SDS solution (1% SDS, 0.1M NaCl, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0)) was added to the suspension while the suspension was gently shaken. Proteinase K (Merck KGaA) was further added (final concentration of 0.1 mg) and shaken at 37° C. for 1 hour. Next, an equivalent volume of TE saturated phenol was added, agitated (TE: 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0)) and then centrifuged. The supernatant was collected, a double volume of ethanol was added and DNA strands were wrapped around a glass rod. Then, the phenol was removed through centrifugation by successively adding 90%, 80%, and 70% ethanol. Next, the DNA was dissolved in a 3 mL TE buffer, to which a Ribonuclease A solution (processed at 100° C. for 15 minutes) was added to have a 10 μg/mL concentration and shaken at 37° C. for 30 minutes. Proteinase K (Merck KGaA) was further added and shaken at 37° C. for 30 minutes. After an equivalent volume of TE saturated phenol was added and centrifuged, the mixture was separated into upper and lower layers. An equivalent volume of TE saturated phenol was further added to the upper layer and centrifuged to separate into upper and lower layers. Such a process was repeated. Then, an equivalent volume of chloroform (containing 4% isoamyl alcohol) was added, centrifuged and the upper layer was collected. Then, a double volume of ethanol was added and the DNA strands were collected by wrapping them around a glass rod. Accordingly, chromosomal DNA was obtained. (2) Using PCR, Preparation of Improved Nitrile Hydratase from Chromosomal DNA Derived from the M8 Strain The nitrile hydratase derived from the M8 strain is described in a non-patent publication (Veiko, V. P. et al., “Cloning, Nucleotide Sequence of Nitrile Hydratase Gene from Rhodococcus rhodochrous M8,” Russian Biotechnology (Mosc.) 5, 3-5 (1995)). The sequences of β subunit and α subunit are respectively identified as SEQ ID NOs: 17 and 18. Based on the sequence information, primers of SEQ ID NOs: 115 and 116 in the sequence listing were synthesized and PCR was performed using the chromosomal DNA prepared in step (1) above as a template. <Composition of PCR Reaction Mixture> sterile water 20 μL template DNA (chromosomal DNA) 1 μL primer M8-1 (10 mM) 2 μL primer M8-2 (10 mM) 2 μL PrimeSTAR MAX (2×) 25 μL total 50 μL <primers> (SEQ ID NO: 115) M8-1: GGTCTAGAATGGATGGTATCCACGACACAGGC (SEQ ID NO: 116) M8-2: CCCCTGCAGGTCAGTCGATGATGGCCATCGATTC <PCR Reaction Conditions> (98° C. for 10 sec, 55° C. for 5 sec, 72° C. for 30 sec)×30 cycles After completion of PCR, 5 μL of the reaction mixture was subjected to 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis (0.7 wt. % Agarose I, made by Dojin Chemical Co., Ltd.) and an amplified fragment of 1.6 kb was detected. The reacted mixture was purified using Wizard SV gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega KK). Next, the collected PCR product was coupled with a vector (pUC118/Hinc II site) using a ligation kit (made by Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd.) so that competent cells of E. coli JM109 were transformed using the reaction mixture. A few clones from the obtained transformant colonies were inoculated into 1.5 mL of an LB-Amp culture medium, and subjected to shaking culture at 37° C. for 12 hours. After incubation was finished, the bacterial cells were collected from the culture through centrifugation. A plasmid DNA was extracted from the collected bacterial cells using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen). The base sequence of nitrile hydratase in the obtained plasmid DNA was confirmed using a sequencing kit and automated sequencer CEQ 8000 (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). Next, the obtained plasmid DNA was cleaved at restriction enzyme XbaI and Sse8387I, and subjected to 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis so as to collect nitrile hydratase gene fragments (1.6 kb), which were then introduced into XbaI-Sse8387I site of plasmid pSJ042. The obtained plasmid was named pSJ-N01A. Here, pSJ042 as a plasmid capable of expressing nitrile hydratase in Rhodococcus J1 strain was prepared by a method described in JP publication 2008-154552. Plasmid pSJ023 used for preparation of pSJ042 is registered as transformant ATCC 12674/pSJ023 (FERM BP-6232) at the International Patent Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Central 6, 1-1-1 Higashi, Tsukuba, Ibaraki), deposited Mar. 4, 1997. Example 18 Preparation and Evaluation of Improved Nitrile Hydratase Using plasmid pSJ-N01A obtained in example 5, the amino acid at position 83 of the α subunit was substituted. The same method as in example 1 was employed for amino-acid substitution to prepare an improved nitrile hydratase. Next, using the same method as in example 2, a transformant of Rhodococcus rhodocrous ATCC 12674 strain and its bacterial-cell suspension were prepared. Then, the enzymatic activity was measured by the same method as in example 4. The results are shown in Table 18. TABLE 18 name of catalytic activity plasmid amino-acid substitution (relative value) pSJ-N01A none (parent strain) 1.0 (comp. example) pSJR17 Qα83M 6.9 From the results above, pSJR17 in which the amino acid at position 83 of the a subunit was substituted with methionine was found to have an enhanced enzymatic activity the same as in example 4. Example 19 Preparation of Improved Nitrile Hydratase Using plasmid pSJ034 formed in preparation example 1, amino-acid substitution was conducted. The following composition of a reaction mixture, reaction conditions and primers were used for the PCR. <Composition of PCR Reaction Mixture> sterile water 20 μL pSJ034 (1 ng/mL) 1 μL Forward primer (10 mM) 2 μL Reverse primer (10 mM) 2 μL PrimeSTAR MAX (2×) 25 μL total 50 μL <PCR Reaction Conditions> (98° C. for 10 sec, 55° C. for 5 sec, 72° C. for 90 sec)×30 cycles <primers> saturation mutagenesis for α82 (SEQ ID NO: 129) α82RM-F: ATGCCGGTNNSCAGGCACACCAAATTT (SEQ ID NO: 130) α82RM-R: TGTGCCTGSNNACCGGCATAGCCCAAT After the completion of PCR, 5 μL of the reaction mixture was subjected to 0.7% agarose gel electrophoresis and an amplified fragment of 1 kb was confirmed. Then, 1 μL of DpnI (provided with a kit) was added to the PCR reaction mixture and reacted at 37° C. for an hour to remove the template plasmid. The reacted mixture was purified using Wizard SV gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega), and JM109 was transformed using the purified PCR reaction product. Then, a plasmid DNA was extracted from the obtained culture using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen), and the base sequence of the nitrile hydratase was confirmed using an automated sequencer CEQ 8000 (Beckman Coulter, Inc.) Obtained plasmids were named as shown in Table 19.

Then, 1 μL of plasmid prepared in example 2 and 10 μL of the bacterial-cell suspension were mixed and ice-cooled. The DNA and the bacterial-cell suspension were supplied in a cuvette, and electric pulse treatment was conducted using an electroporation device, Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad Laboratories), under conditions of 2.0 kV and 200Ω. The electric-pulse processed mixture was let stand in an ice-cold condition for 10 minutes, and subjected to heat shock at 37° C. for 10 minutes. After 500 μL of an MYK culture medium (0.5% polypeptone, 0.3% Bacto yeast extract, 0.3% Bacto malt extract, 0.2% K2HPO4, 0.2% KH2PO4) was added and let stand at 30° C. for 5 hours, and applied onto an MYK agar culture medium containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin and incubated at 30° C. for 3 days. The obtained colony after incubating at 30° C. for 3 days was used as a transformant. Each transformant obtained above was inoculated into an MYK culture medium (50 μg/mL kanamycin), subjected to shaking culture at 30° C. for 2 days. Then, 1% culture was inoculated into a GGPK culture medium (1.5% glucose, 1% sodium glutamate, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.05% K2HPO4, 0.05% KH2PO4, 0.05% Mg2O4.7H2O, 1% CoCl2, 0.1% urea, 50 μg/mL kanamycin, pH 7.2), and subjected to shaking culture at 30° C. for 3 days. Then, bacterial cells were collected by using a centrifuge and were washed with a 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) to prepare a bacterial-cell suspension. Example 21 Improved Nitrile Hydratase Activity The nitrile hydratase activity in the obtained bacterial-cell suspension was measured by the following method. After 0.2 mL of the bacterial-cell mixture and 4.8 mL of a 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) were mixed, 5 mL of a 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 5.0% (w/v) acrylonitrile was further added, and the mixture was reacted while being shaken at 10° C. for 10 minutes. Then, bacterial cells were filtered and the amount of produced acrylamide was determined by gas chromatography. <Analysis Conditions> analysis instrument: gas chromatograph GC2014 (Shimadzu Corporation) detector: FID (detection at 200° C.) column: 1 m glass column filled with PoraPak PS (column filler made by Waters Corp.) column temperature: 190° C. Nitrile hydratase activity was determined by conversion from the amount of acrylamide. Here, regarding nitrile hydratase activity, the amount of enzyme to produce 1 μmol of acrylamide per 1 minute is set as 1 U. Table 20 shows relative activities when the parent strain activity without amino-acid substitution was set at 1.0.

Example 22 SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis Using a sonicator VP-300 (TAITEC Corporation), the bacterial-cell suspension prepared in example 3 was homogenized for 10 minutes while being ice-cooled. Next, the bacterial-cell homogenate was centrifuged at 13500 rpm for 30 minutes and a cell-free extract was obtained from the supernatant. After the protein content of the cell extract was measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit, the cell extract was mixed with a polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% w/v SDS, 12% v/v β mercaptoethanol, 20% v/v glycerol, and a trace of bromophenol blue), and boiled for 5 minutes for denaturation. A 10% acrylamide gel was prepared, and denatured samples were applied to have an equivalent protein mass per one lane to conduct electrophoresis analysis. As a result, since hardly any difference was observed in the band strength of nitrile hydratase in all the samples, the expressed amount of nitrile hydratase was found the same. Accordingly, enzymatic specific activity was found to be attributed to the improved enzymatic activity.
