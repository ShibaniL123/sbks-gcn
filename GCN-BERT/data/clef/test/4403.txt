TCR(alpha)-LCR-DERIVED GENE REGULATORY CASSETTES CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims priority to and is a non-provisional of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 61/990,807 (filed May 9, 2014) the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. STATEMENT OF FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT [0002] This invention was made with Government support under Contract Number SC1-GM095402 awarded by the National Institute of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences. REFERENCE TO A SEQUENCE LISTING [0003] This application refers to a "Sequence Listing" listed below, which is provided as an electronic document entitled "2015051 1_Sequence.txt" (12 kb, created on April 27, 2015), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0004] The subject matter disclosed herein relates to T-cell receptor alpha (TCRa) locus control region (LCR)-derived gene regulatory cassettes. A locus control region (LCR) is defined by an ability to impart position-independent and high-level tissue-specific expression of a linked transgene. The LCR protects the transgene from certain effects that could silence the transgene if it integrates into inactive chromatin. [0005] The T-cell receptor a (TCRa) gene is exclusively expressed in T-lineage cells. Pre-rearranged TCRa transgenes are expressed only in T-cell-bearing tissues, such as thymus and spleen, but not in other organs, such as liver and heart. Even within T-cell- bearing tissues, current vectors used in T-cell gene therapy are not immune from silencing effects that halt the expression of the transgene. Nor are these vectors spatiotemporally specific in their production of the therapeutic transgene product. This limits this approach to vector transduction of terminally differentiated T-cells. [0006] It would be advantageous to transduce stem cell populations with such vectors to produce an ever-renewable source of T-cells expressing the therapeutic gene product. But to do this in a safe way, vectors must be designed to direct high-level therapeutic gene expression to T-cells, and not other stem cell progeny. To do this in an effective way, the vector must also be equipped with regulatory DNA that enables the vector to be resilient to the silencing effects of heterochromatin dynamics during T-cell differentiation from stem cell precursors. Unfortunately, no vectors are currently known that are entirely satisfactory. A new vector is therefore desired. [0007] The discussion above is merely provided for general background information and is not intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0008] A method of delivering a transgene to a cell is provided. The method uses a vector that contains a T-cell receptor alpha locus control region (TCRαLCR) derived gene regulatory cassette having fewer than 5.0-kb. The method delivers the transgene with spatiotemporally specific gene expression and silencing-prevention controls to a cell such that a predetermined subset of progeny cell-types express a gene product from the transgene. Other progeny of the cell diminish, or silence, the expression of the gene product. An advantage that may be realized in the practice of some disclosed embodiments of the method is the ability to direct high-level therapeutic transgene expression to T-cells but not to inadvertently impact other stem cell progeny. Another advantage that may be realized in the practice of some disclosed embodiments is the ability to express a transgene in a manner that is resilient to silencing effects. [0009] In a first embodiment, a method of delivering a gene to a cell is provided such that a predetermined subset of progeny of the cell expresses a predetermined gene product with spatiotemporally specificity and resistance to silencing. The method comprises introducing a vector to a cell. The vector comprises (a) a T-cell receptor alpha locus control region (TCRaLCR) derived gene regulatory cassette having fewer than 5.0- kb, the TCRaLCR derived gene regulatory cassette comprising a sequence that is at least 70% identical with SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3; and (b) a first transgene to be expressed. [0010] In a second embodiment, a method of delivering a gene to a T cell is provided such that the T cell expresses a predetermined gene product with resistance to silencing. The method comprises introducing a vector to a T cell. The vector comprises (a) a T-cell receptor alpha locus control region (TCRaLCR) derived gene regulatory cassette having fewer than 5.0-kb, the TCRaLCR derived gene regulatory cassette comprising a sequence that is at least 70% identical with SEQ ID NO: 3; and (b) a first transgene to be expressed. [0011] In a third embodiment, a vector for delivering a gene to a cell is provided such that a predetermined subset of progeny of the cell expresses a predetermined gene product with spatiotemporally specificity and resistance to silencing. The vector comprises (a) a T-cell receptor alpha locus control region (TCRaLCR) derived gene regulatory cassette having fewer than 5.0-kb, the TCRaLCR derived gene regulatory cassette comprising a sequence that is at least 70% identical with SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3; and (b) a first transgene to be expressed.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0020] Several T-cell receptor alpha (TCRa) locus control region (LCR)-derived gene regulatory cassettes are disclosed herein. Generally, these nucleotides range from 4.0- kbp to 1.3-kbp in DNA length. They contain various combinations of DNA from four functional regions of the TCRa LCR (as defined by studies in transgenic mouse models). These four functional regions refer to specific DNAse I hypersensitive sites (HS) within the TCRa LCR named as follows: HS 1, HS 1', HS4, HS6. The combinations were made via recombinant DNA technology and were maintained/produced using bacterial plasmid vectors. These regulatory cassettes provide consistent, high-level transgene expression from gene transfer vectors that is: 1) spatiotemporally specific to T-cells and 2) resistant to the silencing effects of genomic heterochromatin spreading. Two cell culture-based assays were developed to measure these two gene regulatory properties. [0021] Finding the minimal amount of TCRα LCR DNA capable of supporting maximal TCRα LCR activity is desirable for incorporation into viral vectors, which typically have limited space for exogenous DNA sequences. The disclosed SEQ ID NO: 1 provides a robust 4.0-kb mini-LCR (TαLCR4.0) version that is 30% of the original DNA length of the full LCR in the genome (13-kb) but reproduces the qualities of the full-length version. The temporal activation pattern of this 4.0-kb mini-LCR is particularly well suited to driving a pattern of the expression of therapeutic antigen receptors that mimics the natural, physiological expression pattern of endogenous αβ T-cell receptor complex emergence in vivo. The early temporal activation kinetics of the small (1.3-kb) mini-LCR (TaLCRl .3) (SEQ ID NO: 3) is well suited for expressing therapeutic cargo genes to correct inherited, genetic T-cell immunodeficiency, or to express genes in T-cells that confer them with intracellular resistance to infection by T-cell tropic viruses (e.g. HIV). Like TaLCR4.0 and TaLCRl .3, the medium (2.4-kb) mini-LCR (TαLCR2.4) (SEQ ID NO: 2) possesses a strong capacity to insulate linked gene expression from silencing over time in the genome of T cells. A more detailed discussion follows. [0022] Protection from silencing ("insulation capacity") [0023] In pilot experiments (data not shown), data showing that the full LCR possessed strong insulator-like activity in this assay was obtained, providing 100% protection of linked transgenes from silencing over time in all clones analyzed (n=7 single copy clones). For a description of the full LCR see B.D. Ortiz et al. Adjacent DNA elements dominantly restrict the ubiquitous activity of a novel chromatin-opening region to specific tissues The EMBO Journal, Vol. 16 No. 16 (1997) pp.5037-5045. In the absence of HS1' through HS6 of the LCR sequences, the linked reporter gene experienced gradual silencing over time in all clones analyzed (n=6 single copy clones). Three TCRαc-LCR constructions (SEQ. ID NO. 1 (TaLCR4.0), SEQ ID NO: 2 (TaLCR2.4) and SEQ ID NO: 3 (TaLCRl .3) were designed to maintain the strong insulator-like activity. [0024] As shown in FIG. 1 three TCRα -derived mini-LCR versions (SEQ ID NO: 1; SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 3) can protect a linked transgene from silencing over time in a T-cell culture model. This "insulation capacity" property of these TCRα "mini- LCRs" was tested in a stable transfected DP T-cell line (VL3-3M2). Transfected VL3- 3M2 T-cell clones were generated bearing TCR Vα promoter driven yellow fluorescence (YFP) reporter genes linked to either the TCRα enhancer only, a full LCR cassette (9.5- kb), or the large (SEQ ID NO: 1 ; ToαLCR4.0), medium (SEQ ID NO: 2; Tα LCR2.4) or small (SEQ ID NO: 3; Tα LCRl .3) mini-LCRs. The TCRa enhancer, which is contained within the HS1 functional region of the LCR, is described in further detail in Winoto and Baltimore, A novel, inducible and T cell-specific enhancer located at the 3 ' end of the T cell receptor a locus, The EMBO Journal, vol. 8, no. 3 (1989) pp 729-33. Specifically, FIG. 1 is a graph of flow cytometry analyses of average %YFP level maintenance (over time) in multiple clones bearing a given reporter construct. "Day" indicates the number of days in the absence of drug selection. The number of clones (n) assessed for each construct is as follows: Enhancer only, n=15, (small, SEQ ID NO: 3), n=19, (medium, SEQ ID NO: 2), n=25 (large, SEQ ID NO: 1), n=10, full LCR, n=9. The depicted p values are calculated using a 2-tailed students T test. [0025] Each clone was cultured in duplicate, one under drug selection, the second without drug selection (to permit detection of reporter gene silencing). YFP levels for all cultures were monitored over a 90-day period. The percent YFP maintenance in the absence of drug selection was calculated (YFPnodrug/YFPdrug) for each clone. All three mini-LCR versions were observed to offer substantial protection from reporter gene silencing by this measure. FIG. 1 shows the average %YFP level maintenance over time among the multiple clones containing a given reporter construct. Only the Ea "enhancer only" clones display significant loss of YFP levels in the absence of drug selection. In contrast, all versions of the mini-LCR offer significant protection from reporter gene silencing with activity comparable to that displayed by the full LCR in this assay. [0026] The gradual gene silencing in enhancer-only clones has been linked to changes in histone modifications at the reporter gene locus. Chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP) studies show maintenance of euchromatin marks (e.g. diacetylated histone H3) at the reporter locus over time when the Tα LCR4.0 (SEQ ID NO. 1) is present (FIG. 2A). Thus, the Tα LCR.4.0 provides an effective barrier to euchromatin loss and gradual gene silencing over time. As shown in FIG. 2A ChIP assays of acetylated histone H3 (Millipore 06-599 antibody) at the YFP (Vα YFP) reporter gene in stably-transfected VL3-3M2 T-cell clones in the presence (+) and absence (-) of drug selection. This mark is maintained in the presence of the Tα LCR4.0. In contrast, withdrawal of drug enables detection of acetylated H3 euchromatin loss in the absence of the LCR (FIG. 2B). ChIP signals are quantified by qRT-PCR. Vα YFP ChIP signals are normalized to GAPDH (internal control) and expressed as a fraction of the signal seen in the presence of drug selection. [0027] Spatiotemporal specificity [0028] FIG. 3G to FIG. 3L shows preliminary reporter gene assay tests of the Tα LCR4.0 "large mini-LCR" (SEQ ID NO: 1) in various blood cell types derived in vitro from mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). Full LCR-driven reporter (hCD2) bearing mESC clones (n>12, e.g. Al see Lahiji, et. al. 2013, J. Immunol 191 :472-9) produce erythroid, monocytic and early (DN1 and DN2 stage) T-cell progeny displaying no significant reporter gene activity. In sharp contrast, later stage (DN3 and DP) T-cells robustly express the TCRa LCR-driven reporter gene. Very promisingly, mESC clones bearing the Tα LCR4.0-driven reporter gene (n=4, e.g. LI 8) show very similar activity to that displayed by the full LCR (FIG. 3A to FIG. 3F). [0029] FIG. 3A to FIG. 3F depicts flow cytometry analyses of the full LCR-driven reporter hCD2 transgene activity in the indicated cell subsets (DN1, DN2, DN3, DP, erythroid and monocytic) derived in vitro from transfected ESC clones. A representative full LCR (Al) and TaLCR4.0 (L18) is shown. FIG. 3A to FIG. 3L each depict mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of per cell FITC-conjugated anti-hCD2 staining as plotted on a logarithmic scale. Relative to full LCR clones, Tα LCR4.0 clones (n=4) show only minor "leakage" of reporter expression in monocytic (10-14% cells in positive gate) and DN1 cells (12-18%). [0030] As shown in FIG. 4F to FIG. 41, preliminary data has also been obtained characterizing the spatiotemporal control characteristics of the TaLCRl .3 (SEQ ID NO: 3). FIG. 4A to FIG. 41 depict mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of per cell FITC- conjugated anti-hCD2 staining as plotted on a logarithmic scale. The small TaLCR1.3 differs from the large TaLCR4.0 (SEQ ID NO: 1) in that it displays activation at an earlier time point in T-cell development (DN1 stage) and also manifests a moderate level of activity in cells of monocytic lineage. The data for the full LCR is shown in FIG. 4A to FIG. 4E. Specifically FIG. 4 A to FIG. 41 depicts a flow cytometry analyses of hCD2 reporter activity (x-axis) in the indicated cell subsets derived in vitro from transfected ESC clones. [0031] These mini-LCRs, in the context of lenti viral gene therapy vectors, can provide cargo gene transcription from lentiviral vectors with the requisite resilience and specificity to be used in gene therapy applications in which T-cells expressing a therapeutic gene product in a patient are derived from genetically engineered stem cell transplants. [0032] The TCRα LCR gives consistent, high-level expression beginning in late stage thymic T-cells and mature peripheral T-cells. This late stage timing is particularly well suited to expression of exogenous antigen receptors, premature expression of which during T-cell development is known to cause abnormalities in mice. In contrast, the hCD2 LCR gives consistent high-level activity from early thymic T-cell stages on and is also consistently active in B-lineage cells. Thus the TCRα LCR is likely to be more specific in directing therapeutic gene expression to T-cells than the hCD2 LCR. The β- globin LCR is only active in erythroid lineage cells. [0033] In other embodiments, cell lines are created to test agents affecting TCRoc gene expression in cell culture. In still other embodiments, transgenic mouse models are created in which it is desired for the introduced gene's expression to be integration site- independent and directed to late stage thymic T cells and mature peripheral T cells. [0034] The efficacy of the disclosed mini-TCRa LCRs in the context of a lentiviral construct has been evaluated. A lentiviral gene transfer vector was obtained. A Va- promoter-driven YFP reporter gene (creating lenti-VaYFP) was cloned into it and further linked this to each of the mini-LCRs. [0035] FIG. 5 A to FIG. 5E shows flow cytometry data on bulk transfected C6VLB T cells carrying the four lentiviral plasmid constructs. The data show that the NTP viral transduction marker and YFP reporter genes are both functional in all constructs, with higher bulk YFP production seen in the presence of the small (s), medium (m) and large (L) mini TCRa-LCRs with little apparent interference with the function of the NTP transduction marker. [0036] In one embodiment, a method of delivering gene product expressed from a genomically integrated vector to a biological cell is provided. The method comprises introducing a genomically integrated vector to a biological cell. The genomically integrated vector comprises (a) a T-cell receptor alpha locus control region (TCRaLCR) derived gene regulatory cassette having fewer than 5.0-kb, the TCRaLCR derived gene regulatory cassette being at least 70% identical with SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2 or SEQ ID NO: 3; and (b) a first transgene to be expressed. In another embodiment, the TCRaLCR derived gene regulatory cassette is at least 80% identical with one of the above-referenced sequences. In yet another embodiment, the TCRaLCR derived gene regulatory cassette is at least 90% identical with one of the above-referenced sequences. In another embodiment, the TCRaLCR derived gene regulatory cassette consists essentially of one of the above-referenced sequences. [0037] The term "transgene" refers to a sequence that includes a promotor and a gene that encodes for a predetermined gene product. The first transgene may be, for example, a short promoter-driven cDNA that encodes a gene product with therapeutic impact. For example, a cDNA may be used to produce a protein in T cells that would substitute for one that would have been produced by an endogenous gene that is congenitally nonfunctional (for examples, see Tasher et al., The genetic basis of severe combined immunodeficiency and its variants, Applications of Clinical Genetics, (August 6, 2012) pp 67-80). Alternatively a cDNA encoding a TCR or chimeric antigen receptor directing T cells to target tumor cells may be used (see Porter et al., Chimeric Antigen Receptor- Modified T Cells in Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia, The New England Journal of Medicine, V. 365, (2011) pp725-33). Alternatively, a cDNA encoding a protein or a non-coding RNA (e.g. miRNA product) that inhibits the life cycle of a T-cell tropic virus inside a T cells may be used (for examples, see Tebas et al., Gene Editing of CCR5 in Autologous CD4 T Cells of Persons Infected with HIV, The New England Journal of Medicine, vol. 370, no. 10 (March 6, 2014), pp 901-910 and Tebas et al., Antiviral effects of autologous CD4 T cells genetically modified with a conditionally replicating lentiviral vector expressing long antisense to HIV, Blood, vol. 121, no. 9, (Feb 26, 2013), pp 1524-1533). The transgene may be linked 5' or 3' to the TCRaLCR derived gene regulatory cassette. [0038] In one embodiment, a second transgene is also provided. The second transgene may, for example, attenuate or modulate the function of the first transgene. For example a first CAR cDNA can be coupled with a second inhibitory CAR cDNA to divert off-target T cell responses (ref: Federov, et. al. Sci. Transl. Med. 2013Decl l;5(215):215ral72.). Alternatively, the first and second transgenes may co- express a set of two incomplete but complementary CAR encoding cDNAs to increase target cell specificity by requiring recognition of two antigens to induce a T cell response (Kloss, et. al. 2013, Nat. Biotechnol. 31 :71-5). Alternatively, a first CAR/TCR transgene can be co-expressed with a second transgene expressing a "suicide cDNA" (e.g. thymidine kinase) that will enable elimination of therapeutic gene expressing cells upon administration of a specific drug (e.g. acyclovir). In another embodiment, the first and second transgenes provide intracellular resistance to two T cell tropic viruses at once (e.g. HIV and HTLV-1). The first and second transgenes, in some embodiments, flank the TCRaLCR derived gene regulatory cassette. [0039] In one embodiment, the TCRαLCR derived gene regulatory cassette has fewer than 5.0-kb and is at least 90% identical with SEQ ID NO: 1. In another embodiment, the TCRaLCR derived gene regulatory cassette has fewer than 3.0-kb and is at least 90% identical with SEQ ID NO: 2. In yet another embodiment, the TCRaLCR derived gene regulatory cassette has fewer than 2.0-kb and is at least 90% identical with SEQ ID NO: 3. [0040] Three mini-TCRa LCRs (SEQ ID NO: 1; SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 3) were constructed from portions of the endogenous mouse TCRa LCR that had been determined to be functional cis-acting gene regulatory elements. These elements were assembled in the pBlueScript SK I (pBSK) cloning vector (Stratagene) as follows. [0041] Construction of the "small" mini-LCR (TαLCR1.3) cassette (SEQ ID NO: 1) [0042] pS-HSll ' PvuII/Sca I: The smallest version of the mini TCRa LCR contains segments of the HS1, HS1' and HS6 functional regions of the full LCR. To isolate the HS1 and 1' region, a PCR scheme was developed to amplify an 804-bp fragment spanning from the Pvu II site located at the 5 '-border of the Ea transcriptional enhancer located in HS 1 to the Sea I site (3 '-border) located in HS F. This region contains Ea and ends right after the identified CTCF sites within HS1 '. The forward primer included an artificial Xho I site on the 5 '-end and the reverse primer included an artificial Cla I site on the 3' end. The sequence for the forward primer was: 5'- GACCTGCTCGAGCTGC ACCCTGAAATGGT-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 4). The reverse primer sequence was: 5 '-CGAGTCATCGATACTGCTGCCCCCGTGTG-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 5). The insertion of these two unique restriction enzyme target sites enabled the insertion of the PCR product into the Xho I and Cla I sites of pBSK. This plasmid contained the functional regions of Ea and HS1' and was termed pS-HSl 1' PvuII/Sac I. [0043] pS-LCR : To complete the construction of the small LCR, a 554-bp Bel I to Bgl II fragment of the HS6 region was placed into the BamHI site of psHSl 1 ' PvuII/Sca I. Since digestions of DNA with Bel I and Bgl II leave both ends compatible with ligation into Bam HI sites, the resulting plasmids was analyzed for clones bearing the fragment in the correct natural genomic orientation. This was confirmed by restriction analysis. The correct plasmid was termed pSLCR, containing the TaLCRl.3 cassette. [0044] Construction of the "medium " mini-LCR (TαLCR2.4) cassette [0045] pM-LCR: The medium version of the mini TCRα LCR (Tα LCR2.4) has the same regions HS1, HS1' and HS6 as the small LCR with the addition of an 1127-bp region containing the HS4 element. This ApaL I to Dra I region of HS4 was blunted and ligated into a unique EcoR V site within pSLCR in between the HS1/HS1 ' and HS6 regions in the natural genomic orientation. [0046] Construction of the "large " mini-LCR (TαLCR4.0) cassette [0047] pL-HSll ' PvuII/BamHI: To isolate the enhancer (HS1) and complete HS1' region of the TCRa LCR, a PCR primer pair was designed to amplify a 1052-bp genomic fragment spanning from a Pvu II site located at the 5' border of the the Ea transcriptional enhancer in HS1 to a Bam HI site located at the 3 '-border of HS1 The forward primer included an artificial Xho I site on the 5' end and reverse primer included an artificial Cla I site on the 3 ' end. The sequence for the forward primer was: 5'- GACCTGCTCGAGCTGC ACCCTGAAATGGT-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 4), while the sequence for the reverse primer was: 5 ' -CGAGTCATCGATACTGCTGCCCCCGTGTGG-3 ' (SEQ ID NO: 5). The PCR product was digested with Xho I and Cla I and placed in to their corresponding sites in PBSK. Once assembled, this PBSK plasmid contained the complete HS 1 and HS Γ region and was termed pL-HS 11 ' PvuII/BamH I. [0048] pL-HSll VL-HS6 : A 1786-bp Mfe I to Ecl36 II fragment containing the complete HS6 region was excised. This fragment was inserted 3' of the HSl/HST DNA in pL- HS 11 ' PvuII/BamH I using the EcoR I site and Sma I sites. [0049] pL-LCR: The 1127-bp ApaL I to 1Dra I fragment containing the HS4 region was blunted and inserted into the EcoR V site of pL-HSl 1 '/L-HS6 in a position in between the HSl/HS1 ' and the HS6 DNA to complete pL-LCR containing the (TaLCR4.0) cassette.
