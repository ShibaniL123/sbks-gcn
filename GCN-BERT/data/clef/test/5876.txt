Automated Injection Device The mechanical workings of an automated injection assisting device can be prepared according to the disclosure in European application publication No. EP0693946 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,855,176, which are incorporated herein by reference. All combinations of the various elements described herein are within the scope of the invention. DEFINITIONS As used herein, “glatiramer acetate” is a complex mixture of the acetate salts of synthetic polypeptides, containing four naturally occurring amino acids: L-glutamic acid, L-alanine, L-tyrosine, and L-lysine. The peak average molecular weight of glatiramer acetate is between 5,000 and 9,000 daltons. Chemically, glatiramer acetate is designated L-glutamic acid polymer with L-alanine, L-lysine and L-tyrosine, acetate (salt). Its structural formula is: [in-line-formulae](Glu,Ala,Lys,Tyr)x.XCH3COOH[/in-line-formulae][in-line-formulae](C5H9NO4.C3H7NO2.C6H14N2O2.C9H11NO3)x.xC2H4O2[/in-line-formulae] CAS-147245-92-9 As used herein “glatiramer acetate drug substance” is the glatiramer acetate active ingredient prior to its formulation into a glatiramer acetate drug product. As used herein, a “glatiramer acetate drug product” is a formulation for pharmaceutical use which contains a glatiramer acetate drug substance. Copaxone is a commercial glatiramer acetate drug product manufactured by TEVA Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Israel), which is described in Copaxone, Food and Drug Administration Approved Labeling (Reference ID: 3443331) [online], TEVA Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., 2014 [retrieved on Dec. 24, 2014], Retrieved from the Internet: <URL: www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/020622s0891bl.pdf>, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Copaxone® is available as 20 mg/mL administered once per day, and/or 40 mg/ml administered three times per week. As used herein, a “sterilizing filter” is a filter with a pore size of 0.2 μm or less which will effectively remove microorganisms. By any range disclosed herein, it is meant that all hundredth, tenth and integer unit amounts within the range are specifically disclosed as part of the invention. Thus, for example, 1 mg to 50 mg means that 1.1, 1.2 . . . 1.9; and 2, 3 . . . 49 mg unit amounts are included as embodiments of this invention. This invention will be better understood by reference to the Experimental Details which follow, but those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the specific experiments detailed are only illustrative of the invention as described more fully in the claims which follow thereafter. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS Methods Glatiramer Acetate (GA) Injection 40 mg/mL in a prefilled syringe (GA injection 40 mg/mL in PFS or Copaxone® 40 mg/mL) was developed as a new formulation of the active ingredient glatiramer acetate, which is also used in the marketed product Copaxone® 20 mg/mL solution for injection in a prefilled syringe. Copaxone® 40 mg/mL is to be administered three times a week by subcutaneous injection to patients with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis. The new formulation is based on the formulation of the marketed Copaxone® 20 mg/mL solution for injection in a prefilled syringe. Copaxone® 20 mg/mL is an approved product, the safety and efficacy of which are supported by over two decades of clinical research and over a decade of post-marketing experience. The only difference between the formulations is the double amount of the active substance used, which results in a solution with double the concentration of glatiramer acetate (40 mg/mL vs. 20 mg/mL). The amount of mannitol in both Copaxone® formulations remains unchanged (40 mg/mL). The compositions of Copaxone® 20 mg/mL and Copaxone® 40 mg/mL are detailed in Table 1. TABLE 1 Compositions of Copaxone ® 20 mg/mL and Copaxone ® 40 mg/mL Copaxone ® Copaxone ® 20 mg/mL 40 mg/mL Components Content per mL Glatiramer Acetate1 20.0 mg 40.0 mg Mannitol 40.0 mg 40.0 mg USP/Ph.Eur. Water for Injection q.s. to 1.0 mL q.s. to 1.0 mL USP/Ph.Eur/JP 1Calculated on the dry basis and 100% assay 1. Calculated on the Dry Basis and 100% Assay Studies were conducted in order to verify that the formulation of Copaxone® 40 mg/mL, its manufacturing process and chemical, biological and microbiological attributes are appropriate for commercialization. Studies were also conducted to confirm the suitability of the proposed container closure system for packaging Copaxone® 40 mg/mL. Mannitol was chosen as the tonicity agent for the initially formulated Copaxone® (freeze dried product, reconstituted prior to administration) as it is also a bulking agent. When the currently marketed ready-to-use formulation of Copaxone® 20 mg/mL solution for injection prefilled syringe was developed, mannitol was used in this formulation as well, as the osmoregulator. Finally, when the new 40 mg/mL formulation was developed, based on the Copaxone® 20 mg/mL formulation, mannitol remained as the osmoregulator. Mannitol is widely used in parenteral formulations as an osmoregulator. It is freely soluble in water and stable in aqueous solutions. Mannitol solutions may be sterilized by filtration. In solution, mannitol is not affected by atmospheric oxygen in the absence of catalysts. The concentration of mannitol in the Copaxone® 40 mg/mL is 40 mg/mL. Maintaining the mannitol concentration in Copaxone® 40 mg/mL resulted in an essentially isotonic solution. Water for injection (WFI) is the most widely used solvent and inert vehicle in parenteral formulations. Water is chemically stable in all physical states. It is the base for many biological life forms, and its safety in pharmaceutical formulations is unquestioned. Example 1 The manufacturing process of Copaxone® 40 mg/mL comprises: Compounding a bulk solution of GA and mannitol in water for injections (WFI).Sterilizing filtration of the bulk solution yielding the sterile GA solution in bulk.Aseptic filling of sterile bulk solution into syringe barrels and stoppering.Inspection and final assembly of the filled syringes. Initially, filtration of bulk solution from the compounding vessel was performed through a sequential filter train consisting of two sequential sterilizing filters (filters named A1 and A2, respectively) to a receiving vessel. From the receiving vessel it was transferred to the intermediate vessel in the filling machine and further through dosing pumps and needles into prefilled syringes. However, due to a Health Authority request to place the sterilizing filter as close as possible to the filling point, the second sterilizing filter was moved between the receiving and intermediate vessels. In the current filtration train, the first sterilizing filter was named Filter A, and the second relocated sterilizing filter was named Filter B. See, FIG. 1. In line with the process for the approved Copaxone® 20 mg/mL formulation, all processing steps of the new Copaxone® 40 mg/mL formulation were originally conducted at controlled room temperature. However, filtration of the higher concentration solution resulted in a pressure build-up on the second filter, Filter B. Despite the observed pressure increase on Filter B, a high-quality drug product could be obtained by filtration of GA 40 mg/mL at controlled room temperature, as confirmed by release and stability data. Nevertheless, an improved filtration process was needed which avoided the build-up on the second filter. Flow rate for fluids can be defined by the differential pressure, and inversely moderated by viscosity. Viscosity, in turn, is usually reciprocal in relation to temperature (Meltzer and Jornitz, Filtration and Purification in the Biopharmaceutical Industry, Second Edition, CRC Press, 2007, page 166). Increasing the temperature of a solution will normally decrease the viscosity, thereby enhancing the flow rate. In an attempt to solve the pressure build-up problem on the second filter, the temperature condition of the filtration was raised above controlled room temperature. Although the viscosity decreased, the filterability decreased, resulting in a failed attempt. The following studies were performed: Filter Validation Study: Determination of ranges for the manufacturing parameters related to sterilizing Filter A and sterilizing Filter B of the bulk solution, as well as confirmation of filter compatibility with the drug product.Filtration Process: Selection of the sterilizing filtration conditions best suitable for the manufacturing process and the quality of the drug product. Filters Used for Copaxone® 20 mg/mL and Copaxone® 40 mg/mL Manufacturing The manufacturing process of Copaxone® 40 mg/mL was based on the process used to produce the marketed Copaxone® 20 mg/mL solution for injection in a prefilled syringe. Therefore the same filters used for filtration of marketed product were used. Two sterilizing filters were used, each of which having a pore size of 0.2 μm or less, to effectively remove microorganisms. Sterilization is achieved only by filtration using sterilizing filters and not by using other methods, e.g. sterilization is achieved without using heat, chemicals, or radiation exposure. Filter Validation Study Confirmation and Setting of Parameters Associated with Filter Compatibility and with Sterilizing Filtration The following tests were performed in order to confirm the filter validity: Extractables testing—assessment of extractables released from the filter upon steam sterilization and their removal from the filter by a model solvent, thus assessing the volume to be discarded after the filtration through the Filter B, prior to beginning of the aseptic filling. Compatibility/adsorption testing—assessment of the chemical compatibility of GA 20 mg/mL and GA 40 mg/mL solution with the filter material and the extent of its adsorption to the filter, thus assessing the volume to be discarded after the filtration through Filter B, prior to beginning of the aseptic filling in order to provide assay within specifications. Residual effect—To ensure that no significant residual GA 20 mg/mL or GA 40 mg/mL solution that might affect the post use integrity test remains on the filter after filtration. Bacterial challenge—To ensure that the filtration process does not affect the ability of the filter to provide a sterile solution. The above tests were conducted using maximum pressure (up to 5.0 bar). The validation study demonstrated that the selected filtration system is capable of providing a high quality Copaxone® 20 mg/mL and Copaxone® 40 mg/mL. Given the strict and well-defined operational and equipment parameters of the GA 40 mg/mL solution filtration process, a plan to mitigate the potential increase in pressure by reducing the filtration temperature was developed. Without much expectations, it was decided to examine the filtration process of GA 40 mg/mL sterile bulk solution through Filter B under reduced temperature conditions, using the same filters and filtration train as for the filtration at controlled room temperature. Accordingly, experiments were performed in order to compare the filtration of GA 40 mg/mL sterile bulk solution through Filter B under reduced temperature and controlled room temperature in the production environment and to ensure that there is no difference with regard to the quality and stability profiles of the filtered solutions. In all experiments, the sterile bulk solution was prepared according to the standard compounding and filtration train (see FIG. 1) and filtered through two filters: Filter A and Filter B. The experiments tested two different cooling technologies (cooled receiving vessels vs heat exchanger) with cooled filter. The studies are schematically depicted in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2. Further details about these experiments and their outcomes are provided hereafter. Filtration Process Experiment No. 1 The objective of Experiment No. 1 was to compare the filterability of a batch of bulk solution held and filtered through Filter B at either controlled room temperature or under reduced temperature conditions (cooling by double-jacketed receiving vessel and cooled Filter B housing). The study is schematically depicted in FIG. 1. The experimental design and the obtained results are summarized in Table 2 and FIG. 3. TABLE 2 Experimental Design and Results for Experiment No. 1.

Bulk solution size: 230 liters. Filtration of solution at controlled room temperature was stopped after 85 liters have been pushed through the filter due to increased pressure and the remaining solution was transferred to the cooled receiving vessels. 2The temperature increased (to 14.9° C.) once during the filtration following the addition of the remaining solution kept at ambient temperature. 3The filtrations were carried out in parallel. Surprisingly, filtration at reduced temperature allowed filtration to be completed without the pressure increase associated with filtration at controlled room temperature. Example 2 Filtration Process Experiment No. 2 The first objective of Experiment No. 2 was to evaluate whether local cooling of GA 40 mg/mL solution using a Heat Exchanger (HE) could improve the filterability through cooled Filter B compared to filterability of the same bulk solution at controlled room temperature. The second objective of Experiment No. 2 was to confirm that there is no difference in the quality of the drug product filled into syringes at controlled room temperature and drug product filled into syringes at reduced temperature. Cooling by heat exchanger was evaluated as it seemed to be much easier to steam sterilize than using the double jacketed receiving vessels. The HE was located between the receiving vessel and Filter B. Consequently, as opposed to Experiment No. 1 (in which the solution was cooled by the double-jacketed receiving vessels following filtration through Filter A and kept cooled prior to filtration through Filter B), the solution in this experiment was held at controlled room temperature prior to filtration of the locally cooled (by HE) GA solution through Filter B. The study is schematically depicted in FIG. 2. The experimental design and the obtained results are summarized in Table 3. The pressure observed over the course of the filling process of Experiment No. 2 is shown in FIG. 4. TABLE 3 Experimental Design and Results for Experiment No. 2.

Both filtration processes demonstrate similar impurity profiles. 1One bulk solution was prepared and divided into two portions. Bulk solution size: 230 liters. 2Both filtration processes (reduced and controlled room temperature) were carried out in parallel for comparison. At each stage, filtration was carried out at controlled room temperature, followed by filtration at reduced temperature. 3Filtration of solution at controlled room temperature was stopped due to pressure increase and the remaining solution was filtered at reduced temperature. Example 3 Filtration Process Experiment No. 3 One objective of Experiment No. 3 was to confirm whether cooling of GA 40 mg/mL bulk solution prior to filtration, using HE and cooled filter housing, allows filtration and filling of batches of 130 L size within various manufacturing regimens. Another objective of Experiment No. 3 was to evaluate the influence of holding time at various stages of the manufacturing process on filterability of GA 40 mg/mL. Another objective of Experiment 3 was to demonstrate with a high degree of assurance that locally cooled GA 40 mg/mL solution filtered through Filter B is not different in its quality and stability profile from GA 40 mg/mL solution filtered through Filter B at controlled room temperature conditions with regard to pre-determined parameters and limits. A series of three batches of bulk solution, manufactured at various regimens, were prepared. Each bulk solution was prepared from an identical combination of the same three drug substance batches. The experimental design and results are summarized in Table 4.

Both filtration processes result in product having substantially the same degradation and impurity profile at stress conditions. 1Batches A and A-2 are from the same bulk solution. Filter B was replaced with a new filter prior to filtration of A-2 . 2Compounding and subsequent holding time in the compounding vessel (incl. filtration through filter A). 3Time from end of filtration through Filter A to beginning of filtration through Filter B and filling. 4Since A-2 was filtered and filled into syringes subsequent to the filtration and filling of A, the stated holding time represents the sum of the holding time of A in addition to the time A-2 was held until the filtration at controlled room temperature was initiated. 5Throughout the filling, gradual increase of filtration pressure was required in order to maintain flow rate that would correspond to the rate required for continuous filling. Based on the results of Experiment No. 3, it was confirmed that local cooling by heat exchanger is sufficient in order to enable filtration of a 130 L batch. In addition, the quality and stability profile of GA 40 mg/mL solutions filtered at controlled room temperature and reduced temperature were found to be substantially identical. Example 4 Cooling of GA 40 mg/mL bulk solution below 17.5° C. in the compounding vessel before passing through cooled Filter A and cooled Filter B in sequence (see FIG. 6) results in lower pressure during the filtration step of both Filter A and Filter B as compared to the holding the same bulk solution in the compounding vessel and passing it through Filter A and Filter B at controlled room temperature (Cooling of the bulk solution by using double jacketed compounding vessel and cooling the filters by using double jacketed filter housings). Reducing the temperature of the GA 40 mg/mL bulk solution in the compounding vessel and passing it through cooled Filter A and Filter B in sequence (see FIG. 6) significantly reduces impairment of filterability caused by the total duration of the process (holding time) as well as by filtering larger volume, compared to the same bulk solution held and filtered under controlled room temperature. Example 5 Local cooling of GA 40 mg/mL bulk solution by a heat exchanger and passing the solution through cooled Filter A and cooled Filter B in sequence (see FIG. 7) results in lower pressure during the filtration step of both Filter A and Filter B as compared to passing the same bulk solution held and filtered under controlled room temperature. Reducing the temperature of the GA 40 mg/mL bulk solution using a heat exchanger and passing it through cooled Filter A and cooled Filter B in sequence (see FIG. 7) significantly reduces impairment of filterability caused by the total duration of the process (holding time) as well as by filtering larger volume, compared to the same bulk solution held and filtered under controlled room temperature. Example 6 Passing the sterilized GA 40 mg/mL bulk solution from the receiving vessel through cooled Filter B (see FIG. 8) significantly results in lower pressure during the filtration step compared to passing the same bulk solution filtered through Filter B under controlled room temperature. Passing the sterilized GA 40 mg/mL bulk solution from the receiving vessel through cooled Filter B (see FIG. 8) significantly reduces impairment of filterability caused by the total duration of the process (holding time) as well as by filtering larger volume, compared to the same bulk solution held and filtered under controlled room temperature. Example 7 Passing GA 40 mg/mL bulk solution from the compounding vessel through cooled Filter A and cooled Filter B in sequence (see FIG. 9) results in lower pressure during the filtration step of both Filter A and Filter B as compared to passing the same bulk solution filtered under controlled room temperature. Passing GA 40 mg/mL bulk solution from the receiving vessel through cooled Filter A and Filter B in sequence (see FIG. 9) significantly reduces impairment of filterability caused by the total duration of the process (holding time) as well as by filtering larger volume, compared to the same bulk solution filtered under controlled room temperature. Example 8 Cooling of GA 40 mg/mL bulk solution below 17.5° C. in the compounding vessel before passing through Filter A and Filter B in sequence (see FIG. 10) results in lower pressure during the filtration step of both Filter A and Filter B as compared to the holding the same bulk solution in the compounding vessel and passing it through Filter A and Filter B at controlled room temperature (Cooling of the bulk solution by using double jacketed compounding vessel). Reducing the temperature of the GA 40 mg/mL bulk solution in the compounding vessel and passing it through Filter A and Filter B in series (see FIG. 10) significantly reduces impairment of filterability caused by the total duration of the process (holding time) as well as by filtering larger volume, compared to the same bulk solution held and under controlled room temperature. Example 9 Cooling of GA 40 mg/mL bulk solution below 17.5° C. in the receiving vessel before passing through Filter B (see FIG. 11) results in lower pressure during the filtration step of Filter B as compared to the holding the same bulk solution in the compounding vessel at controlled room temperature (Cooling of the bulk solution by using double jacketed compounding vessel). Reducing the temperature of the GA 40 mg/mL bulk solution in the receiving vessel (see FIG. 10) significantly reduces impairment of filterability caused by the total duration of the process (holding time) as well as by filtering larger volume, compared to the same bulk solution held under controlled room temperature. Discussion of Examples 1-9 Reducing the temperature of GA 40 mg/mL sterile bulk solution significantly improved its filterability, as demonstrated by the much lower increase in pressure on Filter B during filtration and filling and by the larger volume that can be filtered at reduced temperature. Pressure increases were observed when the sterile bulk solution was held and filtered at controlled room temperature, while there was no significant increase in the pressure when the solution was filtered under reduced temperature conditions. The holding time of the bulk solution during filtration through Filter B negatively affects the filterability of the solution. However, the total duration of the process (holding time) impaired the filterability significantly less when filtration was performed under reduced temperature conditions. Consequently, longer holding time can be used with reduced temperature filtration. Both cooling of the solution by passing it through a heat exchanger (local cooling) and/or cooling of the whole bulk (e.g. by double-jacketed receiving vessel) before filtration through cooled Filters A or B or A and B were found to be suitable solutions for reduced temperature filtration. Accumulated stability data indicate that there is no substantial difference with regard to quality and stability profile between the solution filtered under reduced temperature conditions and the solution filtered at controlled room temperature. In sum, the performed experiments show that reduced temperature filtration through Filter B significantly improved the filterability of GA 40 mg/mL solution compared to the filterability of the solution when filtered at controlled room temperature. Moreover, reducing the temperature of the bulk solution during the compounding stage or before passing through Filter A, or reducing the temperature of Filter A also improves the filterability of GA 40 mg/mL solution compared to the filterability of the solution at controlled room temperature. Consequently, the proposed manufacturing process for commercial batches of GA 20 mg/mL and GA 40 mg/mL includes cooling of the solution prior to filtration of the bulk solution through Filter B. Example 10 Container Closure System The container closure systems selected for the Copaxone® 40 mg/mL are the same as those used for the marketed product Copaxone® 20 mg/mL PFS. The container closure system consists of a colorless glass barrel, a plastic plunger rod and a grey rubber stopper. Long Term and Accelerated Stability Studies Satisfactory stability data after up to 36 months storage under long-term storage conditions (5° C.±3° C.) and after 6 months storage under accelerated conditions (25°±2° C./60±5% RH) are available. The data demonstrate that the proposed container closure systems are suitable for protection and maintenance of the drug product quality throughout its proposed shelf-life. Protection from Light Marketed Copaxone® should be stored protected from light. Based on this recommendation, it is proposed that Copaxone® 40 mg/mL be similarly packed in PVC transparent blisters inside a carton box, which provides light protection. The light protection of the proposed packaging when used for the Copaxone® 40 mg/mL is recommended in accordance with the results obtained from a photostability study comparing the following packaging configurations: 1. Glass barrel syringe and plunger rod (Primary package); Glass barrel syringe and plunger rod in a transparent blister (partial secondary package);Glass barrel syringe and plunger rod in a transparent blister inside carton box (complete intended packaging configuration). As a reference, the following configurations were added: 2. Glass barrel syringe and plunger rod wrapped in aluminum foil; Glass barrel and plunger rod in a transparent blister wrapped in aluminum foil. All packages were simultaneously exposed to standardized sunlight (5 KLUX) for 10 days and to near UV light for additional 5 days. All the obtained results from the photostability study are within the specifications. However, the impurity peak detected is lower when the drug product is packed in its complete packaging configuration. The carton box was shown to improve the photostability and gives light protection as good as that of aluminum foil, which is regarded as a complete light protector. The intended packaging configuration is therefore considered suitable for its use. A storage statement to protect the product from light exposure should be added to the product label. Microbiological Attributes The medicinal product is a sterile, single dose, parenteral dosage form. Sterilization is achieved by sterile filtration. A microbial limits test is performed for the drug substance. The sterility and bacterial endotoxins are monitored upon release and throughout stability studies of the drug product, using pharmacopoeia methods. The limits applied are identical to those applied for the marketed Copaxone®. The same container closure systems are used for the Copaxone® 20 mg/mL and Copaxone® 40 mg/mL. The integrity testing studies performed to demonstrate the efficacy of the container closure systems on use for the marketed product are also considered relevant for Copaxone® 40 mg/mL.

Further, the results indicate that batches of Copaxone® 20 mg/mL were slightly hypotonic. 1.
