FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to novel polymorphs and salts of a compound which is an inhibitor of kinase activity, more specifically a compound which is an inhibitor of the activity or function of phosphoinositide 3′OH kinase isoform delta (hereinafter PI3Kδ), processes for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, and their use in the treatment of various disorders. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Cellular membranes represent a large store of second messengers that can be enlisted in a variety of signal transduction pathways. In relation to function and regulation of effector enzymes in phospholipids signaling pathways, class I PI3-kinases (e.g. PI3Kδ) generate second messengers from the membrane phospholipid pools. Class I PI3Ks convert the membrane phospholipid PI(4,5)P2 into PI(3,4,5)P3, which functions as a second messenger. PI and PI(4)P are also substrates of PI3K and can be phosphorylated and converted into PI3P and PI(3,4)P2, respectively. In addition, these phosphoinositides can be converted into other phosphoinositides by 5′-specific and 3′-specific phophatases. Thus, PI3K enzymatic activity results either directly or indirectly in the generation of two 3′-phosphoinositide subtypes which function as second messengers in intracellular signal transduction pathways (Trends Biochem. Sci. 22(7) p. 267-72 (1997) by Vanhaesebroeck et al.; Chem. Rev. 101(8) p. 2365-80 (2001) by Leslie et al.; Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 17 p. 615-75 (2001) by Katso et al.; and Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 59(5) p. 761-79 (2002) by Toker). To date, eight mammalian PI3Ks have been identified, divided into three main classes (I, II, and III) on the basis of sequence homology, structure, binding partners, mode of activation, and substrate preference. In vitro, class I PI3Ks can phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P), and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) to produce phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P), phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2, and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3, respectively. Class II PI3Ks can phosphorylate PI and PI4P. Class III PI3Ks can only phosphorylate PI (Vanhaesebroeck et al. (1997), above; Vanhaesebroeck et al. Exp. Cell Res. 253(1) p. 239-54 (1999); and Leslie et al. (2001), above). Class I PI3K is a heterodimer consisting of a p110 catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit, and the family is further divided into class Ia and class Ib enzymes on the basis of regulatory partners and mechanism of regulation. Class Ia enzymes consist of three distinct catalytic subunits (p110α, p110β, and p110δ) that dimerise with five distinct regulatory subunits (p85α, p55α, p50α, p85β, and p55γ), with all catalytic subunits being able to interact with all regulatory subunits to form a variety of heterodimers. Class Ia PI3K are generally activated in response to growth factor-stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinases, via interaction of the regulatory subunit SH2 domains with specific phosphotyrosine residues of the activated receptor or adaptor proteins such as IRS-1. Small GTPases (ras as an example) are also involved in the activation of PI3K in conjunction with receptor tyrosine kinase activation. Both p110α and p110β are constitutively expressed in all cell types, whereas p110δ expression is more restricted to leukocyte populations and some epithelial cells. In contrast, the single Class Ib enzyme consists of a p110γ catalytic subunit that interacts with a p101 regulatory subunit. Furthermore, the Class Ib enzyme is activated in response to G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) systems and its expression appears to be limited to leukocytes. As illustrated in Scheme A above, phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) phosphorylate the hydroxyl of the third carbon of the inositol ring. The phosphorylation of phosphoinositides to generate PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3)P, produces second messengers for a variety of signal transduction pathways, including those essential to cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell growth, cell size, cell survival, apoptosis, adhesion, cell motility, cell migration, chemotaxis, invasion, cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell shape changes, vesicle trafficking and metabolic pathway (Katso et al. (2001), above; and Mol. Med. Today 6(9) p. 347-57 (2000) by Stein et al.). The activity of PI3-kinases responsible for generating these phosphorylated signalling products was originally identified as being associated with viral oncoproteins and growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate phosphatidylinositol (PI) and its phosphorylated derivatives at the 3′-hydroxyl of the inositol ring (Panayotou et al. Trends Cell Biol. 2 p. 358-60 (1992)). However, more recent biochemical studies have revealed that class I PI3-kinases (e.g. class IA isoform PI3Kδ) are dual-specific kinase enzymes, meaning they display both lipid kinase (phosphorylation of phosphoinositides) as well as protein kinase activity, which have been shown to be capable of phosphorylation of other protein as substrates, including auto-phosphorylation as an intramolecular regulatory mechanism (EMBO J. 18(5) p. 1292-302 (1999) by Vanhaesebroeck et al.). Cellular processes in which PI3Ks play an essential role include suppression of apoptosis, reorganization of the actin skeleton, cardiac myocyte growth, glycogen synthase stimulation by insulin, TNFα-mediated neutrophil priming and superoxide generation, and leukocyte migration and adhesion to endothelial cells. PI3-kinase activation, is believed to be involved in a wide range of cellular responses including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (Parker, Current Biology 5(6) p. 577-79 (1995); and Yao et al. Science 267(5206) p. 2003-06 (1995)). PI3-kinase appears to be involved in a number of aspects of leukocyte activation. A p85-associated PI3-kinase has been shown to physically associate with the cytoplasmic domain of CD28, which is an important costimulatory molecule for the activation of T-cells in response to antigen (Pages et al. Nature 369 p. 327-29 (1994); and Rudd, Immunity 4 p. 527-34 (1996)). Activation of T cells through CD28 lowers the threshold for activation by antigen and increases the magnitude and duration of the proliferative response. These effects are linked to increases in the transcription of a number of genes including interleukin-2 (IL2), an important T cell growth factor (Fraser et al. Science 251(4991) p. 313-16 (1991)). PI3Kγ has been identified as a mediator of G beta-gamma-dependent regulation of JNK activity, and G beta-gamma are subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Lopez-Ilasaca et al. J. Biol. Chem. 273(5) p. 2505-8 (1998)). Recently, (Laffargue et al. Immunity 16(3) p. 441-51 (2002)) it has been described that PI3Kγ relays inflammatory signals through various G(i)-coupled receptors and is central to mast cell function, stimuli in the context of leukocytes, and immunology including cytokines, chemokines, adenosines, antibodies, integrins, aggregation factors, growth factors, viruses or hormones for example (J. Cell Sci. 114 (Pt 16) p. 2903-10 (2001) by Lawlor et al.; Laffargue et al. (2002), above; and Curr. Opinion Cell Biol. 14(2) p. 203-13 (2002) by Stephens et al.). Specific inhibitors against individual members of a family of enzymes provide invaluable tools for deciphering functions of each enzyme. Two compounds, LY294002 and wortmannin (hereinafter), have been widely used as PI3-kinase inhibitors. These compounds are non-specific PI3K inhibitors, as they do not distinguish among the four members of Class I PI3-kinases. For example, the IC50 values of wortmannin against each of the various Class I PI3-kinases are in the range of 1-10 nM. Similarly, the IC50 values for LY294002 against each of these PI3-kinases is about 15-20 μM (Fruman et al. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 67 p. 481-507 (1998)), also 5-10 microM on CK2 protein kinase and some inhibitory activity on phospholipases. Wortmannin is a fungal metabolite which irreversibly inhibits PI3K activity by binding covalently to the catalytic domain of this enzyme. Inhibition of PI3K activity by wortmannin eliminates subsequent cellular response to the extracellular factor. For example, neutrophils respond to the chemokine fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) by stimulating PI3K and synthesizing PtdIns (3, 4, 5)P3. This synthesis correlates with activation of the respiratory burst involved in neutrophil destruction of invading microorganisms. Treatment of neutrophils with wortmannin prevents the fMLP-induced respiratory burst response (Thelen et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 91 p. 4960-64 (1994)). Indeed, these experiments with wortmannin, as well as other experimental evidence, show that PI3K activity in cells of hematopoietic lineage, particularly neutrophils, monocytes, and other types of leukocytes, is involved in many of the non-memory immune response associated with acute and chronic inflammation. Based on studies using wortmannin, there is evidence that PI3-kinase function is also required for some aspects of leukocyte signaling through G-protein coupled receptors (Thelen et al. (1994), above). Moreover, it has been shown that wortmannin and LY294002 block neutrophil migration and superoxide release. It is now well understood that deregulation of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes contributes to the formation of malignant tumours, for example by way of increased cell growth and proliferation or increased cell survival. It is also now known that signaling pathways mediated by the PI3K family have a central role in a number of cell processes including proliferation and survival, and deregulation of these pathways is a causative factor a wide spectrum of human cancers and other diseases (Katso et al. Annual Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. (2001) 17 p. 615-675 and Foster et al. J. Cell Science (2003) 116(15) p. 3037-3040). PI3K effector proteins initiate signalling pathways and networks by translocating to the plasma membrane through a conserved Pleckstrin Homology (PH) domain, which specifically interacts with PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (Vanhaesebroeck et al. Annu. Rev. Biochem. (2001) 70 p. 535-602). The effector proteins signalling through PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PH domains include Serine/Threonine (Ser/Thr) kinases, Tyrosine kinases, Rac or Arf GEFs (Guanine nucleotide exchange factors) and Arf GAPs (GTPase activating proteins). In B and T cells PI3Ks have an important role through activation of the Tec family of protein tyrosine kinases which include Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) in B cells and Interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) in T cells. Upon PI3K activation, BTK or ITK translocate to the plasma membrane where they are subsequently phosphorylated by Src kinases. One of the major targets of activated ITK is phospholipase C-gamma (PLCγ1), which hydrolyses PtdIns(4,5)P2 into Ins(3,4,5)P3 and initiates an intracellular increase in calcium levels and diacylglycerol (DAG) which can activate Protein Kinases C in activated T cells. Unlike the Class IA p110α and p110β, p110δ is expressed in a tissue restricted fashion. Its high expression level in lymphocytes and lymphoid tissues suggests a role in PI3K-mediated signalling in the immune system. The p110δ kinase dead knock-in mice are also viable and their phenotype is restricted to defects in immune signalling (Okkenhaug et al. Science (2002) 297 p. 1031-4). These transgenic mice have offered insight into the function of PI3Kδ in B-cell and T-cell signalling. In particular, p110δ is required for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 formation downstream of CD28 and/or T cell Receptor (TCR) signalling. A key effect of PI3K signalling downstream of TCR is the activation of Akt, which phosphorylates anti-apoptotic factors as well as various transcription factors for cytokine production. As a consequence, T cells with inactive p110δ have defects in proliferation and Th1 and Th2 cytokine secretion. Activation of T cells through CD28 lowers the threshold for TCR activation by antigen and increases the magnitude and duration of the proliferative response. These effects are mediated by the PI3Kδ-dependent increase in the transcription of a number of genes including IL2, an important T cell growth factor. Therefore, PI3K inhibitors are anticipated to provide therapeutic benefit via its role in modulating T-cell mediated inflammatory responses associated to respiratory diseases such as asthma, COPD and cystic fibrosis. In addition, there is indication that T-cell directed therapies may provide corticosteroid sparing properties (Alexander et al. Lancet (1992) 339 p. 324-8) suggesting that it may provide a useful therapy either as a standalone or in combination with inhaled or oral glucocorticosteroids in respiratory diseases. A PI3K inhibitor might also be used alongside other conventional therapies such as a long acting beta-agonists (LABA) in asthma. In the vasculature, PI3Kδ is expressed by endothelial cells and participates in neutrophil trafficking by modulating the proadhesive state of these cells in response to TNFalpha (Puri et al. Blood (2004) 103(9) p. 3448-56.). A role for PI3Kδ in TNFalpha-induced signalling of endothelial cells is demonstrated by the pharmacological inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and PDK1 activity. In addition, PI3Kδ is implicated in vascular permeability and airway tissue edema through the VEGF pathway (Lee et al. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. (2006) 118(2) p. 403-9). These observations suggest additional benefits of PI3Kδ inhibition in asthma by the combined reduction of leukocyte extravasation and vascular permeability associated with asthma. In addition, PI3Kδ activity is required for mast cell function both in vitro and in vivo (Ali et al. Nature (2004) 431 p. 1007-11; and Ali et al. J. Immunol. (2008) 180(4) p. 2538-44) further suggesting that PI3K inhibition should be of therapeutical benefit for allergic indications such asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis. The role of PI3Kδ in B cell proliferation, antibody secretion, B-cell antigen and IL-4 receptor signalling, B-cell antigen presenting function is also well established Okkenhaug et al. (2002), above; Al-Alwan et al. J. Immunol. (2007) 178(4) p. 2328-35; and Bilancio et al. Blood (2006) 107(2) p. 642-50) and indicates a role in autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. Therefore PI3K inhibitors may also be of benefit for these indications. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3Kδ inhibits fMLP-dependent neutrophil chemotaxis on an ICAM coated agarose matrix integrin-dependent biased system (Sadhu et al., J. Immunol. (2003) 170(5) p. 2647-54.). Inhibition of PI3Kδ regulates neutrophil activation, adhesion and migration without affecting neutrophil mediated phagocytosis and bactericidal activity over Staphylococcus aureus (Sadhu et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. (2003) 308(4) p. 764-9). Overall, the data suggest that PI3Kδ inhibition should not globally inhibit neutrophil functions required for innate immune defence. PI3Kδ's role in neutrophils offers further scope for treating inflammatory diseases involving tissue remodeling such as COPD or rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, there is also good evidence that class Ia PI3K enzymes also contribute to tumourigenesis in a wide variety of human cancers, either directly or indirectly (Vivanco and Sawyers, Nature Reviews Cancer (2002) 2(7) p. 489-501). For example, inhibition of PI3Kδ may have a therapeutic role for the treatment of malignant haematological disorders such as acute myeloid leukaemia (Billottet et al. Oncogene (2006) 25(50) p. 6648-59). Moreover, activating mutations within p110α (PIK3CA gene) have been associated with various other tumors such as those of the colon and of the breast and lung (Samuels et al. Science (2004) 304(5670) p. 554). It has also been shown that PI3K is involved in the establishment of central sensitization in painful inflammatory conditions (Pezet et al. The J. of Neuroscience (2008) 28 (16) p. 4261-4270). A wide variety of retroviruses and DNA based viruses activate the PI3K pathway as a way of preventing host cell death during viral infection and ultimately exploiting the host cell synthesis machinery for its replication (Virology 344(1) p. 131-8 (2006) by Vogt et al.; and Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 6(4) p. 265-75 (2008) by Buchkovich et al.). Therefore PI3K inhibitors may have anti-viral properties in addition to more established oncolytic and anti-inflammatory indications. These antiviral effects raise interesting prospects in viral induced inflammatory exacerbations. For example, the common cold human rhinovirus (HRV) is responsible for more than 50% of respiratory tract infections but complications of these infections can be significant in certain populations. This is particularly the case in respiratory diseases such as asthma or chronic obstruction pulmonary disease (COPD). Rhinoviral infection of epithelial cells leads to a PI3K dependent cytokine and chemokine secretion (J. Biol. Chem. (2005) 280(44) p. 36952 by Newcomb et al.). This inflammatory response correlates with worsening of respiratory symptoms during infection. Therefore PI3K inhibitors may dampen an exaggerated immune response to an otherwise benign virus. The majority of HRV strains infect bronchial epithelial cells by initially binding to the ICAM-1 receptor. The HRV-ICAM-1 complex is then further internalised by endocytosis and it has been shown that this event requires PI3K activity (J. Immunol. (2008) 180(2) p. 870-880 by Lau et al.). Therefore, PI3K inhibitors may also block viral infections by inhibiting viral entry into host cells. PI3K inhibitors may be useful in reducing other types of respiratory infections including the fungal infection aspergillosis (Mucosal Immunol. (2010) 3(2) p. 193-205 by Bonifazi et al.). In addition, PI3Kδ deficient mice are more resistant towards infections by the protozoan parasite Leishmania major (J. Immunol. (2009) 183(3) p. 1921-1933 by Liu et al.). Taken with effects on viral infections, these reports suggest that PI3K inhibitors may be useful for the treatment of a wide variety of infections. PI3K inhibition has also been shown to promote regulatory T cell differentiation (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (2008) 105(22) p. 7797-7802 by Sauer et al.) suggesting that PI3K inhibitors may serve therapeutic purposes in auto-immune or allergic indications by inducing immuno-tolerance towards self antigen or allergen. Recently the PI3Kδ isoform has also been linked to smoke induced glucocorticoid insensitivity (Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. (2009) 179(7) p. 542-548 by Marwick et al.). This observation suggests that COPD patients, which otherwise respond poorly to corticosteroids, may benefit from the combination of a PI3K inhibitor with a corticosteroid. PI3K has also been involved in other respiratory conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a fibrotic disease with progressive decline of lung function and increased mortality due to respiratory failure. In IPF, circulating fibrocytes are directed to the lung via the chemokine receptor CXCR4. PI3K is required for both signalling and expression of CXCR4 (Int. J. Biochem. and Cell Biol. (2009) 41 p. 1708-1718 by Mehrad et al.). Therefore, by reducing CXCR4 expression and blocking its effector function, a PI3K inhibitor should inhibit the recruitment of fibrocytes to the lung and consequently slow down the fibrotic process underlying IPF, a disease with high unmet need. Compounds which are PI3-kinase inhibitors may therefore be useful in the treatment of disorders associated with inappropriate kinase activity, in particular inappropriate PI3-kinase activity, for example in the treatment and prevention of disorders mediated by PI3-kinase mechanisms. Such disorders include respiratory diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); viral infections including viral respiratory tract infections and viral exacerbation of respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD; non-viral respiratory infections including aspergillosis and leishmaniasis; allergic diseases including allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis; autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis; inflammatory disorders including inflammatory bowel disease; cardiovascular diseases including thrombosis and atherosclerosis; hematologic malignancies; neurodegenerative diseases; pancreatitis; multiorgan failure; kidney diseases; platelet aggregation; cancer; sperm motility; transplantation rejection; graft rejection; lung injuries; and pain including pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, back pain, general inflammatory pain, post hepatic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, inflammatory neuropathic pain (trauma), trigeminal neuralgia and Central pain. Attempts have been made to prepare compounds which inhibit PI3-kinase activity and a number of such compounds have been disclosed in the art.

Methods of Use The polymorphs and salts of the invention may be useful in the treatment of disorders wherein the underlying pathology is (at least in part) attributable to inappropriate PI3-kinase activity, such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). “Inappropriate PI3-kinase activity” refers to any PI3-kinase activity that deviates from the normal PI3-kinase activity expected in a particular patient. Inappropriate PI3-kinase may take the form of, for instance, an abnormal increase in activity, or an aberration in the timing and or control of PI3-kinase activity. Such inappropriate activity may result then, for example, from overexpression or mutation of the protein kinase leading to inappropriate or uncontrolled activation. Accordingly, in another aspect the invention is directed to methods of treating such disorders. Such disorders include respiratory diseases including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF); viral infections including viral respiratory tract infections and viral exacerbation of respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD; non-viral respiratory infections including aspergillosis and leishmaniasis; allergic diseases including allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis; autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis; inflammatory disorders including inflammatory bowel disease; cardiovascular diseases including thrombosis and atherosclerosis; hematologic malignancies; neurodegenerative diseases; pancreatitis; multiorgan failure; kidney diseases; platelet aggregation; cancer; sperm motility; transplantation rejection; graft rejection; lung injuries; and pain including pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, back pain, general inflammatory pain, post hepatic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, inflammatory neuropathic pain (trauma), trigeminal neuralgia and Central pain. In one embodiment, such disorders include respiratory diseases including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); allergic diseases including allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis; autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis; inflammatory disorders including inflammatory bowel disease; cardiovascular diseases including thrombosis and atherosclerosis; hematologic malignancies; neurodegenerative diseases; pancreatitis; multiorgan failure; kidney diseases; platelet aggregation; cancer; sperm motility; transplantation rejection; graft rejection; lung injuries; and pain including pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, back pain, general inflammatory pain, post hepatic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, inflammatory neuropathic pain (trauma), trigeminal neuralgia and Central pain The methods of treatment of the invention comprise administering a safe and effective amount of a polymorph or salt of the invention to a patient in need thereof. Individual embodiments of the invention include methods of treating any one of the above-mentioned disorders by administering a safe and effective amount of a polymorph or salt of the invention to a patient in need thereof. As used herein, “treat” in reference to a disorder means: (1) to ameliorate or prevent the disorder or one or more of the biological manifestations of the disorder, (2) to interfere with (a) one or more points in the biological cascade that leads to or is responsible for the disorder or (b) one or more of the biological manifestations of the disorder, (3) to alleviate one or more of the symptoms or effects associated with the disorder, or (4) to slow the progression of the disorder or one or more of the biological manifestations of the disorder. As indicated above, “treatment” of a disorder includes prevention of the disorder. The skilled artisan will appreciate that “prevention” is not an absolute term. In medicine, “prevention” is understood to refer to the prophylactic administration of a drug to substantially diminish the likelihood or severity of a disorder or biological manifestation thereof, or to delay the onset of such disorder or biological manifestation thereof. As used herein, “safe and effective amount” in reference to a polymorph or salt of the invention or other pharmaceutically-active agent means an amount sufficient to treat the patient's condition but low enough to avoid serious side effects (at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio) within the scope of sound medical judgment. A safe and effective amount of a compound will vary with the particular compound chosen (e.g. consider the potency, efficacy, and half-life of the compound); the route of administration chosen; the disorder being treated; the severity of the disorder being treated; the age, size, weight, and physical condition of the patient being treated; the medical history of the patient to be treated; the duration of the treatment; the nature of concurrent therapy; the desired therapeutic effect; and like factors, but can nevertheless be routinely determined by the skilled artisan. As used herein, “patient” refers to a human (including adults and children) or other animal. In one embodiment, “patient” refers to a human. The polymorphs and salts of the invention may be administered by any suitable route of administration, including both systemic administration and topical administration. Systemic administration includes oral administration, parenteral administration, transdermal administration and rectal administration. Parenteral administration refers to routes of administration other than enteral or transdermal, and is typically by injection or infusion. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous injection or infusion. Topical administration includes application to the skin as well as intraocular, otic, intravaginal, inhaled and intranasal administration. Inhalation refers to administration into the patient's lungs whether inhaled through the mouth or through the nasal passages. In one embodiment, the polymorphs and salts of the invention may be administered orally. In another embodiment, the polymorphs and salts of the invention may be administered by inhalation. In a further embodiment, the polymorphs and salts of the invention may be administered intranasally. The polymorphs and salts of the invention may be administered once or according to a dosing regimen wherein a number of doses are administered at varying intervals of time for a given period of time. For example, doses may be administered one, two, three, or four times per day. In one embodiment, a dose is administered once per day. In a further embodiment, a dose is administered twice per day. Doses may be administered until the desired therapeutic effect is achieved or indefinitely to maintain the desired therapeutic effect. Suitable dosing regimens for a polymorph or salt of the invention depend on the pharmacokinetic properties of that polymorph or salt, such as absorption, distribution, and half-life, which can be determined by the skilled artisan. In addition, suitable dosing regimens, including the duration such regimens are administered, for a polymorph or salt of the invention depend on the disorder being treated, the severity of the disorder being treated, the age and physical condition of the patient being treated, the medical history of the patient to be treated, the nature of concurrent therapy, the desired therapeutic effect, and like factors within the knowledge and expertise of the skilled artisan. It will be further understood by such skilled artisans that suitable dosing regimens may require adjustment given an individual patient's response to the dosing regimen or over time as individual patient needs change. Typical daily dosages may vary depending upon the particular route of administration chosen. Typical daily dosages for oral administration range from 0.001 mg to 50 mg per kg of total body weight, for example from 1 mg to 10 mg per kg of total body weight. For example, daily dosages for oral administration may be from 0.5 mg to 2 g per patient, such as 10 mg to 1 g per patient. In one aspect, the invention thus provides a method of treating a disorder mediated by inappropriate PI3-kinase activity comprising administering a safe and effective amount of a polymorph or salt of the invention to a patient in need thereof. In one embodiment, the disorder mediated by inappropriate PI3-kinase activity is selected from the group consisting of respiratory diseases (including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)); viral infections (including viral respiratory tract infections and viral exacerbation of respiratory diseases such as asthma and COPD); non-viral respiratory infections (including aspergillosis and leishmaniasis); allergic diseases (including allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis); autoimmune diseases (including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis); inflammatory disorders (including inflammatory bowel disease); cardiovascular diseases (including thrombosis and atherosclerosis); hematologic malignancies; neurodegenerative diseases; pancreatitis; multiorgan failure; kidney diseases; platelet aggregation; cancer; sperm motility; transplantation rejection; graft rejection; lung injuries; and pain (including pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis, back pain, general inflammatory pain, post hepatic neuralgia, diabetic neuropathy, inflammatory neuropathic pain (trauma), trigeminal neuralgia and Central pain). In one embodiment, the disorder mediated by inappropriate PI3-kinase activity is a respiratory disease. In another embodiment, the disorder mediated by inappropriate PI3-kinase activity is asthma. In another embodiment, the disorder mediated by inappropriate PI3-kinase activity is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

In one aspect, the invention provides a polymorph or salt of the invention for use in medical therapy. In another aspect, the invention provides a polymorph or salt of the invention for use in the treatment of a disorder mediated by inappropriate PI3-kinase activity. In a further aspect, the invention provides the use of a polymorph or salt of the invention in the manufacture of a medicament for use in the treatment of a disorder mediated by inappropriate PI3-kinase activity. Compositions The polymorphs and salts of the invention will normally, but not necessarily, be formulated into pharmaceutical compositions prior to administration to a patient. Accordingly, in one aspect the invention is directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a polymorph or salt of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. In another aspect the invention is directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising 0.05 to 1000 mg of a polymorph or salt of the invention and 0.1 to 2 g of one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. In a further aspect the invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition for the treatment or prophylaxis of a disorder mediated by inappropriate PI3-kinase activity comprising a polymorph or salt of the invention The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be prepared and packaged in bulk form wherein a safe and effective amount of a polymorph or salt of the invention can be extracted and then given to the patient such as with powders or syrups. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be prepared and packaged in unit dosage form wherein each physically discrete unit contains a polymorph or salt of the invention. When prepared in unit dosage form, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention typically may contain, for example, from 0.5 mg to 1 g, or from 1 mg to 700 mg, or from 5 mg to 100 mg of a polymorph or salt of the invention. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention typically contain one polymorph or salt of the invention. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” means a pharmaceutically acceptable material, composition or vehicle involved in giving form or consistency to the pharmaceutical composition. Each excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the pharmaceutical composition when commingled such that interactions which would substantially reduce the efficacy of the polymorph or salt of the invention when administered to a patient and interactions which would result in pharmaceutical compositions that are not pharmaceutically acceptable are avoided. In addition, each excipient must of course be pharmaceutically-acceptable eg of sufficiently high purity. The polymorph or salt of the invention and the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or excipients will typically be formulated into a dosage form adapted for administration to the patient by the desired route of administration. For example, dosage forms include those adapted for (1) oral administration such as tablets, capsules, caplets, pills, troches, powders, syrups, elixers, suspensions, solutions, emulsions, sachets, and cachets; (2) parenteral administration such as sterile solutions, suspensions, and powders for reconstitution; (3) transdermal administration such as transdermal patches; (4) rectal administration such as suppositories; (5) inhalation such as aerosols, solutions, and dry powders; and (6) topical administration such as creams, ointments, lotions, solutions, pastes, sprays, foams, and gels. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients will vary depending upon the particular dosage form chosen. In addition, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be chosen for a particular function that they may serve in the composition. For example, certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be chosen for their ability to facilitate the production of uniform dosage forms. Certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be chosen for their ability to facilitate the production of stable dosage forms. Certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be chosen for their ability to facilitate the carrying or transporting of the polymorph or salt of the invention once administered to the patient from one organ, or portion of the body, to another organ, or portion of the body. Certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may be chosen for their ability to enhance patient compliance. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients include the following types of excipients: diluents, fillers, binders, disintegrants, lubricants, glidants, granulating agents, coating agents, wetting agents, solvents, co-solvents, suspending agents, emulsifiers, sweetners, flavoring agents, flavor masking agents, coloring agents, anticaking agents, hemectants, chelating agents, plasticizers, viscosity increasing agents, antioxidants, preservatives, stabilizers, surfactants, and buffering agents. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain pharmaceutically acceptable excipients may serve more than one function and may serve alternative functions depending on how much of the excipient is present in the formulation and what other excipients are present in the formulation. Skilled artisans possess the knowledge and skill in the art to enable them to select suitable pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients in appropriate amounts for use in the invention. In addition, there are a number of resources that are available to the skilled artisan which describe pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and may be useful in selecting suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Examples include Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Company), The Handbook of Pharmaceutical Additives (Gower Publishing Limited), and The Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients (the American Pharmaceutical Association and the Pharmaceutical Press). The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are prepared using techniques and methods known to those skilled in the art. Some of the methods commonly used in the art are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences (Mack Publishing Company). Accordingly, in another aspect the invention is directed to process for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a polymorph or salt of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which comprises mixing the ingredients. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a polymorph or salt of the invention may be prepared by, for example, admixture at ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure. In one embodiment, the polymorph or salt of the invention will be formulated for oral administration. In another embodiment, the polymorph or salt of the invention will be formulated for inhaled administration. In a further embodiment, the polymorph or salt of the invention will be formulated for intranasal administration. In one aspect, the invention is directed to a solid oral dosage form such as a tablet or capsule comprising a safe and effective amount of a polymorph or salt of the invention and a diluent or filler. Suitable diluents and fillers include lactose, sucrose, dextrose, mannitol, sorbitol, starch (e.g. corn starch, potato starch, and pre-gelatinized starch), cellulose and its derivatives (e.g. microcrystalline cellulose), calcium sulfate, and dibasic calcium phosphate. The oral solid dosage form may further comprise a binder. Suitable binders include starch (e.g. corn starch, potato starch, and pre-gelatinized starch), gelatin, acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, tragacanth, guar gum, povidone, and cellulose and its derivatives (e.g. microcrystalline cellulose). The oral solid dosage form may further comprise a disintegrant. Suitable disintegrants include crospovidone, sodium starch glycolate, croscarmelose, alginic acid, and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose. The oral solid dosage form may further comprise a lubricant. Suitable lubricants include stearic acid, magnesuim stearate, calcium stearate, and talc. Where appropriate, dosage unit formulations for oral administration can be microencapsulated. The composition can also be prepared to prolong or sustain the release as for example by coating or embedding particulate material in polymers, wax or the like. The polymorphs and salts of the invention may also be coupled with soluble polymers as targetable drug carriers. Such polymers can include polyvinylpyrrolidone, pyran copolymer, polyhydroxypropylmethacrylamide-phenol, polyhydroxyethylaspartamidephenol, or polyethyleneoxidepolylysine substituted with palmitoyl residues. Furthermore, the polymorphs and salts of the invention may be coupled to a class of biodegradable polymers useful in achieving controlled release of a drug, for example, polylactic acid, polepsilon caprolactone, polyhydroxy butyric acid, polyorthoesters, polyacetals, polydihydropyrans, polycyanoacrylates and cross-linked or amphipathic block copolymers of hydrogels. In another aspect, the invention is directed to a liquid oral dosage form. Oral liquids such as solution, syrups and elixirs can be prepared in dosage unit form so that a given quantity contains a predetermined amount of a polymorph or salt of the invention. Syrups can be prepared by dissolving the a polymorph or salt of the invention in a suitably flavored aqueous solution, while elixirs are prepared through the use of a non-toxic alcoholic vehicle. Suspensions can be formulated by dispersing the polymorph or salt of the invention in a non-toxic vehicle. Solubilizers and emulsifiers such as ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols and polyoxy ethylene sorbitol ethers, preservatives, flavor additive such as peppermint oil or natural sweeteners or saccharin or other artificial sweeteners, and the like can also be added. In another aspect, the invention is directed to a dosage form adapted for administration to a patient by inhalation, for example as a dry powder, an aerosol, a suspension, or a solution composition. In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a dosage form adapted for administration to a patient by inhalation as a dry powder. In a further embodiment, the invention is directed to a dosage form adapted for administration to a patient by inhalation via a nebulizer. Dry powder compositions for delivery to the lung by inhalation typically comprise a polymorph or salt of the invention as a finely divided powder together with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients as finely divided powders. Pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients particularly suited for use in dry powders are known to those skilled in the art and include lactose, starch, mannitol, and mono-, di-, and polysaccharides. The finely divided powder may be prepared by, for example, micronisation and milling. Generally, the size-reduced (eg micronised) compound can be defined by a D50 value of about 1 to about 10 microns (for example as measured using laser diffraction). The dry powder may be administered to the patient via a reservoir dry powder inhaler (RDPI) having a reservoir suitable for storing multiple (un-metered doses) of medicament in dry powder form. RDPIs typically include a means for metering each medicament dose from the reservoir to a delivery position. For example, the metering means may comprise a metering cup, which is movable from a first position where the cup may be filled with medicament from the reservoir to a second position where the metered medicament dose is made available to the patient for inhalation. Alternatively, the dry powder may be presented in capsules (e.g. gelatin or plastic), cartridges, or blister packs for use in a multi-dose dry powder inhaler (MDPI). MDPIs are inhalers wherein the medicament is comprised within a multi-dose pack containing (or otherwise carrying) multiple defined doses (or parts thereof) of medicament. When the dry powder is presented as a blister pack, it comprises multiple blisters for containment of the medicament in dry powder form. The blisters are typically arranged in regular fashion for ease of release of the medicament therefrom. For example, the blisters may be arranged in a generally circular fashion on a disc-form blister pack, or the blisters may be elongate in form, for example comprising a strip or a tape. Each capsule, cartridge, or blister may, for example, contain between 20 μg-10 mg of the polymorph or salt of the invention. Aerosols may be formed by suspending or dissolving a polymorph or salt of the invention in a liquified propellant. Suitable propellants include halocarbons, hydrocarbons, and other liquified gases. Representative propellants include: trichlorofluoromethane (propellant 11), dichlorofluoromethane (propellant 12), dichlorotetrafluoroethane (propellant 114), tetrafluoroethane (HFA-134a), 1,1-difluoroethane (HFA-152a), difluoromethane (HFA-32), pentafluoroethane (HFA-12), heptafluoropropane (HFA-227a), perfluoropropane, perfluorobutane, perfluoropentane, butane, isobutane, and pentane. Aerosols comprising a polymorph or salt of the invention will typically be administered to a patient via a metered dose inhaler (MDI). Such devices are known to those skilled in the art. The aerosol may contain additional pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients typically used with MDIs such as surfactants, lubricants, cosolvents and other excipients to improve the physical stability of the formulation, to improve valve performance, to improve solubility, or to improve taste. There is thus provided as a further aspect of the invention a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation comprising a polymorph or salt of the invention and a fluorocarbon or hydrogen-containing chlorofluorocarbon as propellant, optionally in combination with a surfactant and/or a cosolvent. According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a pharmaceutical aerosol formulation wherein the propellant is selected from 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoro-n-propane and mixtures thereof. The formulations of the invention may be buffered by the addition of suitable buffering agents. Capsules and cartridges for use in an inhaler or insufflator, of for example gelatine, may be formulated containing a powder mix for inhalation of a polymorph or salt of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch. Each capsule or cartridge may generally contain from 20 μg to 10 mg of the polymorph or salt of the invention. Alternatively, the polymorph or salt of the invention may be presented without excipients such as lactose. The proportion of the active polymorph or salt in the local compositions according to the invention depends on the precise type of formulation to be prepared but will generally be within the range of from 0.001 to 10% by weight. Generally, for most types of preparations, the proportion used will be within the range of from 0.005 to 1%, for example from 0.01 to 0.5%. However, in powders for inhalation or insufflation the proportion used will normally be within the range of from 0.1 to 5%. Aerosol formulations are preferably arranged so that each metered dose or “puff” of aerosol contains from 20 μg to 10 mg, preferably from 20 μg to 2000 μg, more preferably from about 20 μg to 500 μg of a polymorph or salt of the invention. Administration may be once daily or several times daily, for example 2, 3, 4 or 8 times, giving for example 1, 2 or 3 doses each time. The overall daily dose with an aerosol will be within the range from 100 μg to 10 mg, preferably from 200 μg to 2000 μg. The overall daily dose and the metered dose delivered by capsules and cartridges in an inhaler or insufflator will generally be double that delivered with aerosol formulations. In the case of suspension aerosol formulations, the particle size of the particulate (e.g., micronised) drug should be such as to permit inhalation of substantially all the drug into the lungs upon administration of the aerosol formulation and will thus be less than 100 microns, desirably less than 20 microns, and in particular in the range of from 1 to 10 microns, such as from 1 to 5 microns, more preferably from 2 to 3 microns. The formulations of the invention may be prepared by dispersal or dissolution of the medicament and a polymorph or salt of the invention in the selected propellant in an appropriate container, for example, with the aid of sonication or a high-shear mixer. The process is desirably carried out under controlled humidity conditions. The chemical and physical stability and the pharmaceutical acceptability of the aerosol formulations according to the invention may be determined by techniques well known to those skilled in the art. Thus, for example, the chemical stability of the components may be determined by HPLC assay, for example, after prolonged storage of the product. Physical stability data may be gained from other conventional analytical techniques such as, for example, by leak testing, by valve delivery assay (average shot weights per actuation), by dose reproducibility assay (active ingredient per actuation) and spray distribution analysis. The stability of the suspension aerosol formulations according to the invention may be measured by conventional techniques, for example, by measuring flocculation size distribution using a back light scattering instrument or by measuring particle size distribution by cascade impaction or by the “twin impinger” analytical process. As used herein reference to the “twin impinger” assay means “Determination of the deposition of the emitted dose in pressurised inhalations using apparatus A” as defined in British Pharmacopaeia 1988, pages A204-207, Appendix XVII C. Such techniques enable the “respirable fraction” of the aerosol formulations to be calculated. One method used to calculate the “respirable fraction” is by reference to “fine particle fraction” which is the amount of active ingredient collected in the lower impingement chamber per actuation expressed as a percentage of the total amount of active ingredient delivered per actuation using the twin impinger method described above. The term “metered dose inhaler” or MDI means a unit comprising a can, a secured cap covering the can and a formulation metering valve situated in the cap. MDI system includes a suitable channeling device. Suitable channeling devices comprise for example, a valve actuator and a cylindrical or cone-like passage through which medicament may be delivered from the filled canister via the metering valve to the nose or mouth of a patient such as a mouthpiece actuator. MDI canisters generally comprise a container capable of withstanding the vapour pressure of the propellant used such as a plastic or plastic-coated glass bottle or preferably a metal can, for example, aluminium or an alloy thereof which may optionally be anodised, lacquer-coated and/or plastic-coated (for example incorporated herein by reference WO96/32099 wherein part or all of the internal surfaces are coated with one or more fluorocarbon polymers optionally in combination with one or more non-fluorocarbon polymers), which container is closed with a metering valve. The cap may be secured onto the can via ultrasonic welding, screw fitting or crimping. MDIs taught herein may be prepared by methods of the art (e.g. see Byron, above and WO96/32099). Preferably the canister is fitted with a cap assembly, wherein a drug-metering valve is situated in the cap, and said cap is crimped in place. In one embodiment of the invention the metallic internal surface of the can is coated with a fluoropolymer, more preferably blended with a non-fluoropolymer. In another embodiment of the invention the metallic internal surface of the can is coated with a polymer blend of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyethersulfone (PES). In a further embodiment of the invention the whole of the metallic internal surface of the can is coated with a polymer blend of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyethersulfone (PES). The metering valves are designed to deliver a metered amount of the formulation per actuation and incorporate a gasket to prevent leakage of propellant through the valve. The gasket may comprise any suitable elastomeric material such as, for example, low density polyethylene, chlorobutyl, bromobutyl, EPDM, black and white butadiene-acrylonitrile rubbers, butyl rubber and neoprene. Suitable valves are commercially available from manufacturers well known in the aerosol industry, for example, from Valois, France (e.g. DF10, DF30, DF60), Bespak plc, UK (e.g. BK300, BK357) and 3M-Neotechnic Ltd, UK (e.g. Spraymiser™). In various embodiments, the MDIs may also be used in conjunction with other structures such as, without limitation, overwrap packages for storing and containing the MDIs, including those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,119,853; 6,179,118; 6,315,112; 6,352,152; 6,390,291; and 6,679,374, as well as dose counter units such as, but not limited to, those described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,360,739 and 6,431,168. Conventional bulk manufacturing methods and machinery well known to those skilled in the art of pharmaceutical aerosol manufacture may be employed for the preparation of large-scale batches for the commercial production of filled canisters. Thus, for example, in one bulk manufacturing method for preparing suspension aerosol formulations a metering valve is crimped onto an aluminium can to form an empty canister. The particulate medicament is added to a charge vessel and liquefied propellant together with the optional excipients is pressure filled through the charge vessel into a manufacturing vessel. The drug suspension is mixed before recirculation to a filling machine and an aliquot of the drug suspension is then filled through the metering valve into the canister. In one example bulk manufacturing method for preparing solution aerosol formulations a metering valve is crimped onto an aluminium can to form an empty canister. The liquefied propellant together with the optional excipients and the dissolved medicament is pressure filled through the charge vessel into a manufacturing vessel. In an alternative process, an aliquot of the liquefied formulation is added to an open canister under conditions which are sufficiently cold to ensure the formulation does not vaporise, and then a metering valve crimped onto the canister. Typically, in batches prepared for pharmaceutical use, each filled canister is check-weighed, coded with a batch number and packed into a tray for storage before release testing. Suspensions and solutions comprising a polymorph or salt of the invention may also be administered to a patient via a nebulizer. The solvent or suspension agent utilized for nebulization may be any pharmaceutically-acceptable liquid such as water, aqueous saline, alcohols or glycols, e.g., ethanol, isopropylalcohol, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, etc. or mixtures thereof. Saline solutions utilize salts which display little or no pharmacological activity after administration. Both organic salts, such as alkali metal or ammonium halogen salts, e.g., sodium chloride, potassium chloride or organic salts, such as potassium, sodium and ammonium salts or organic acids, e.g., ascorbic acid, citric acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, etc. may be used for this purpose. Other pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients may be added to the suspension or solution. The polymorph or salt of the invention may be stabilized by the addition of an inorganic acid, e.g., hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulphuric acid and/or phosphoric acid; an organic acid, e.g., ascorbic acid, citric acid, acetic acid, and tartaric acid, etc., a complexing agent such as EDTA or citric acid and salts thereof; or an antioxidant such as antioxidant such as vitamin E or ascorbic acid. These may be used alone or together to stabilize the polymorph or salt of the invention. Preservatives may be added such as benzalkonium chloride or benzoic acid and salts thereof. Surfactant may be added particularly to improve the physical stability of suspensions. These include lecithin, disodium dioctylsulphosuccinate, oleic acid and sorbitan esters. In a further aspect, the invention is directed to a dosage form adapted for intranasal administration. Formulations for administration to the nose may include pressurised aerosol formulations and aqueous formulations administered to the nose by pressurised pump. Formulations which are non-pressurised and adapted to be administered topically to the nasal cavity are of particular interest. Suitable formulations contain water as the diluent or carrier for this purpose. Aqueous formulations for administration to the lung or nose may be provided with conventional excipients such as buffering agents, tonicity modifying agents and the like. Aqueous formulations may also be administered to the nose by nebulisation. The polymorph and salts of the invention may be formulated as a fluid formulation for delivery from a fluid dispenser, for example a fluid dispenser having a dispensing nozzle or dispensing orifice through which a metered dose of the fluid formulation is dispensed upon the application of a user-applied force to a pump mechanism of the fluid dispenser. Such fluid dispensers are generally provided with a reservoir of multiple metered doses of the fluid formulation, the doses being dispensable upon sequential pump actuations. The dispensing nozzle or orifice may be configured for insertion into the nostrils of the user for spray dispensing of the fluid formulation into the nasal cavity. A fluid dispenser of the aforementioned type is described and illustrated in WO05/044354, the entire content of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. The dispenser has a housing which houses a fluid discharge device having a compression pump mounted on a container for containing a fluid formulation. The housing has at least one finger-operable side lever which is movable inwardly with respect to the housing to cam the container upwardly in the housing to cause the pump to compress and pump a metered dose of the formulation out of a pump stem through a nasal nozzle of the housing. In one embodiment, the fluid dispenser is of the general type illustrated in FIGS. 30-40 of WO05/044354. Pharmaceutical compositions adapted for intranasal administration wherein the carrier is a solid include a coarse powder having a particle size for example in the range 20 to 500 microns which is administered by rapid inhalation through the nasal passage from a container of the powder held close up to the nose. Suitable compositions wherein the carrier is a liquid, for administration as a nasal spray or as nasal drops, include aqueous or oil solutions of the polymorph or salt of the invention. Pharmaceutical compositions adapted for transdermal administration may be presented as discrete patches intended to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the patient for a prolonged period of time. For example, the active ingredient may be delivered from the patch by iontophoresis as generally described in Pharmaceutical Research, 3(6), 318 (1986). Pharmaceutical compositions adapted for topical administration may be formulated as ointments, creams, suspensions, lotions, powders, solutions, pastes, gels, sprays, aerosols or oils. Ointments, creams and gels, may, for example, be formulated with an aqueous or oily base with the addition of suitable thickening and/or gelling agent and/or solvents. Such bases may thus, for example, include water and/or an oil such as liquid paraffin or a vegetable oil such as arachis oil or castor oil, or a solvent such as polyethylene glycol. Thickening agents and gelling agents which may be used according to the nature of the base include soft paraffin, aluminium stearate, cetostearyl alcohol, polyethylene glycols, woolfat, beeswax, carboxypolymethylene and cellulose derivatives, and/or glyceryl monostearate and/or non-ionic emulsifying agents. Lotions may be formulated with an aqueous or oily base and will in general also contain one or more emulsifying agents, stabilising agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents or thickening agents. Powders for external application may be formed with the aid of any suitable powder base, for example, talc, lactose or starch. Drops may be formulated with an aqueous or non-aqueous base also comprising one or more dispersing agents, solubilising agents, suspending agents or preservatives. Topical preparations may be administered by one or more applications per day to the affected area; over skin areas occlusive dressings may advantageously be used. Continuous or prolonged delivery may be achieved by an adhesive reservoir system. For treatments of the eye or other external tissues, for example mouth and skin, the compositions may be applied as a topical ointment or cream. When formulated in an ointment, the polymorph or salt of the invention may be employed with either a paraffinic or a water-miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the a polymorph or salt of the invention may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream base or a water-in-oil base. Pharmaceutical compositions adapted for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The compositions may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets. The polymorphs and salts and pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may be used in combination with or include one or more other therapeutic agents, for example selected from anti-inflammatory agents, anticholinergic agents (particularly an M1/M2/M3 receptor antagonist), β2-adrenoreceptor agonists, antiinfective agents, such as antibiotics or antivirals, or antihistamines.

One embodiment of the invention encompasses combinations comprising one or two other therapeutic agents. It will be clear to a person skilled in the art that, where appropriate, the other therapeutic ingredient(s) may be used in the form of salts, for example as alkali metal or amine salts or as acid addition salts, or prodrugs, or as esters, for example lower alkyl esters, or as solvates, for example hydrates to optimise the activity and/or stability and/or physical characteristics, such as solubility, of the therapeutic ingredient. It will be clear also that, where appropriate, the therapeutic ingredients may be used in optically pure form.

A further aliquot of THF was added at this point and the suspension stirred overnight at ambient temperature. The solids were isolated by filtration and dried in vacuo at 50° C. overnight to give the hemi-sebacate salt. NMR: Consistent with Salt Formation NMR (400 MHz, DMSO d6) d=13.49 (s, 1H), 11.94 (bs, 1H), 10.38 (bs, 1H), 9.38 (s, 1H), 8.58 (s, 1H), 8.42 (d, J=2.2 Hz, 1H), 7.99 (d, J=2.0 Hz, 1H), 7.93 (s, 1H), 7.88 (s, 1H), 7.35 (s, 1H), 4.00 (s, 3H), 3.74 (s, 2H), 3.11 (s, 3H), 2.80 (d, J=10.5, 2H), 2.18 (t, J=7.3 Hz, 2H), 1.48 (t, J=6.8 Hz, 2H), 1.25 (s, 4H), 1.05 (d, J=6.1 Hz, 6H). Sample contains 0.85 molar equivalents tetrahydrofuran—NMR signals 3.60 ppm (m, 3.3H) and 1.76 ppm (m, 3.4H). Hemi Pyromellitate A solution of pyromellitic acid (0.0546 g, 0.215 mmol, 0.55 eq) was made up in tetrahydrofuran (1 ml) and added to N-[5-[4-(5-{[(2R,6S)-2,6-dimethyl-4-morpholinyl]methyl}-1,3-oxazol-2-yl)-1H-indazol-6-yl]-2-(methyloxy)-3-pyridinyl]methanesulfonamide (0.1999 g, 0.390 mmol) followed by further tetrahydrofuran (1 ml). This suspension was sonicated at which point the solids changed physical character and set solid. A further aliquot of tetrahydrofuran (2 ml) was added and the solution was heated and sonicated, however dissolution was not observed. The suspension was allowed to cool and stir overnight at room temperature. The solids were collected by filtration and washed with tetrahydrofuran (2 ml) before drying in vacuo overnight at 50° C. to give the hemi-pyromellitate salt as a tetrahydrofuran solvate. NMR: Consistent with Salt Formation NMR (400 MHz, DMSO d6) d=13.52 (s, 1H), 9.39 (s, 1H), 8.61 (s, 1H), 8.42 (d, J=2.2 Hz, 1H), 8.20 (s, 1H), 7.99 (d, J=2.2 Hz, 1H), 7.96 (s, 1H), 7.91 (s, 1H), 7.45 (s, 1H), 4.01 (s, 5H), 3.60 (m, 6H), 3.11 (s, 3H), 3.02 (d, J=10.8 Hz, 2H), 2.06 (bs, 2H), 1.76 (m, 4H), 1.05 (d, J=6.1 Hz, 6H). Tetrahydrofuran signals are 3.60 ppm (m, 4H) and 1.76 ppm (M, 4H) corresponding to 1 molar equivalent. Hemi Benzenediacrylate 1,4-Benzenediacrylic acid (0.0431 g, 0.197 mmol, 0.5 eq) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (0.5 ml) with heating, this was added to N-[5[4-(5-{[(2R,6S)-2,6-dimethyl-4-morpholinyl]methyl}-1,3-oxazol-2-yl)-1H-indazol-6-yl]-2-(methyloxy)-3-pyridinyl]methanesulfonamide (0.2003 g, 0.391 mmol) and heated to give a solution. Tetrahydrofuran (1 ml) was added to the solution and it was then heated and sonicated before being allowed to stir at room temperature overnight. The solids were isolated by filtration and washed with tetrahydrofuran before being dried in vacuo at 65° C. overnight to give the hemi-benzenediacrylate salt (0.1385 g, 57% th). NMR: Consistent with Salt Formation NMR (400 MHz, DMSO d6) d=13.49 (bs, 1H), 12.40 (bs, 1H), 9.38 (bs, 1H), 8.58 (s, 1H), 8.42 (d, J=2.2 Hz, 1H), 7.99 (d, J=2.2 Hz, 1H), 7.93 (s, 1H), 7.88 (s, 1H), 7.73 (s, 2H), 7.58 (d, J=16.1 Hz, 1H), 7.35 (s, 1H), 6.62 (d, J=16.1 Hz, 1H), 4.00 (s, 3H), 3.74 (s, 2H), 3.11 (s, 3H), 2.80 (d, J=10.5 Hz, 2H), 1.05 (d, J=6.4 Hz, 6H).
