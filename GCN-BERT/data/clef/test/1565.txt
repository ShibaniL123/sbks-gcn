BACKGROUND 1. Field of the Invention This invention relates to exercise devices. Specifically those exercise devices that provide targeted anaerobic exercise through the use of the exerciser's body weight. 2. Description of Prior Art Physical exercise provides well known benefits. When performed properly and on a regular basis, physical exercise helps individuals control weight, combat health conditions and diseases, improve emotional well-being, increase energy and improve sleep. Although overlap is common, athletes generally categorize exercises into aerobic exercise and anaerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise improves the strength and efficiency of the exerciser's cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. Anaerobic exercise increases the efficiency and number of muscle fibers affected by a particular exercise. Because anaerobic exercise primarily affects the muscle fibers targeted by a particular exercise, exercisers often perform exercises that isolate and target a particular muscle group. Exercisers and athletes often attempt to train muscle groups in a manner that allows them to develop muscle fibers while improving their cardiovascular health. This type of training often involves performing several different anaerobic exercises with little or no rest between exercises. An example of this type of training is the Cross Fit style of training. Cross Fit requires an exerciser to perform, for example, push-up followed immediately by pull-ups and other compound exercises. A variety of exercise devices have been developed to help exercisers isolate and target a particular muscle group. These devices often use an additional component to provide resistance during an exercise. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,746,382 B2 describes a device for targeting an exerciser's quadriceps and relies on elastic bands to provide resistance. A variety of exercise devices have been developed that rely on the exerciser's body weight for resistance. U.S. Pat. No. 7,892,157 B2 discloses an exercise device that allows the exerciser to perform a variety of exercises using his or her body weight as resistance. While U.S. Pat. No. 7,892,157 B2 relies on body weight for resistance, it does not support the exerciser's body in a manner that prevents the exerciser's non-targeted muscle groups from assisting in an exercise. Devices that isolate the biceps are common in the prior art. U.S. Pat. No. 5,256,125 discloses a biceps curling machine. The device successfully targets the exerciser's biceps, but has the disadvantages of requiring a large mechanical frame and heavy metallic weights for resistance and it fails to develop the exerciser's Posterior Deltoids and Latissimus Dorsi. These devices also have the disadvantage of requiring time to set up and, therefore, preventing the exerciser from combining aerobic and anaerobic training. SUMMARY The invention disclosed in an exercise device that targets the exerciser's biceps and supporting muscle groups while using the exerciser's body weight as resistance. OBJECTS AND ADVANTAGES A person's body weight can provide significant resistance during exercise. The U.S. military services, for example, use a combination of push-ups, pull-ups and sit-ups as a significant portion of their strength training programs for new recruits. Therefore, the proposed invention has the following intentions a) To provide a device that targets the exerciser's biceps, posterior deltoids and latissimus dorsi b) To provide the exerciser with the opportunity to perform exercises without the need for heavy metallic weights or elastic bands with varying resistance c) To provide the exerciser with the opportunity to exercise his or her biceps without needing to spend time adjusting or setting up the exercise device d) To offer a device that allows the exerciser to train his or her biceps, posterior deltoids and latissimus dorsi while being able to quickly transition to other exercises BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEVERAL VIEWS OF THE DRAWINGS Overview: All the drawings are listed as FIGS. 1 through 8.

The example exercise device 100 includes a frame assembly 200, a support pad 300, a curl bar 400 and mounting provisions 500. FIG. 2 is a rear perspective view of an example of the exercise device 100. The example exercise device 100 includes a frame assembly 200 with a first rigid member 201, a second rigid member 202, a left-most rigid member 203, a right-most rigid member 204, a left-most horizontal rigid member 205, a right-most horizontal rigid member 206, a left-most angled rigid member 207, a right-most angled rigid member 208, a third rigid member 209, a left-most pad support rigid member 210, a right-most pad support rigid member 211, a fourth rigid member 212 and a fifth rigid member 213. In the preferred embodiment, the first rigid member 201, second rigid member 202 and third rigid member 209 will be of equal length. However, one skilled in the art will recognize that the first rigid member 201, second rigid member 202 and third rigid member 209 may be cut to any suitable length to satisfy a particular application. For example, larger cuts may be used to target men while smaller cuts may be used to target women. In the preferred embodiment, the first rigid member 201 and second rigid member 202 are horizontally oriented, spaced a distance apart and on the same plane. The left-most rigid member 203 is joined to the left-most ends of both the first rigid member 201 and the second rigid member 202. The right-most rigid member 204 is joined to the right-most ends of both the first rigid member 201 and the second rigid member 202. When viewed from the rear, the joined first rigid member 201, second rigid member 202, left-most rigid member 203 and right-most rigid member 204 will form a generally square or rectangular shape. Continuing with the preferred embodiment, FIG. 3 depicts a side profile of the exercise device. As shown in FIG. 3, the right-most horizontal rigid member 206 is joined at the junction of the second rigid member 202 and the right-most rigid member 204. The right-most angled rigid member 208 is joined with both the right-most horizontal rigid member 206 and at the junction of the right-most rigid member 204 and the first rigid member 201. Similarly, as shown in FIG. 2 the left-most horizontal rigid member 205 is joined at the junction of the second rigid member 202 and the left-most rigid member 203. The left-most angled rigid member 207 is joined with both the left-most horizontal rigid member 205 and at the junction of the left-most rigid member 203 and the first rigid member 201. When viewed from the side and as depicted in FIG. 3, the joined right-most horizontal rigid member 206, right-most rigid member 204 and right-most angled rigid member 208 will form a generally triangular shape. Similarly, the joined left-most horizontal rigid member 205, left-most rigid member 203 and left-most angled rigid member 207 will form a generally triangular shape. In the preferred embodiment, the angle formed between the left-most angled rigid member 207 and the left most horizontal rigid member 205 will be between 45 and 50 degrees. This angle has been determined to provide maximum benefit from the exercise while promoting safe usage of the device. FIG. 4 depicts the view A-A as defined in FIG. 3. FIG. 4 depicts the pad support portion of the exercise device's frame. In the preferred embodiment, the fourth rigid member 212 is joined at the junction of left-most angled rigid member 207 and the left-most horizontal rigid member 205. Similarly, the fifth rigid member 213 is joined at the junction of the right-most angled rigid member 208 and the right-most horizontal rigid member 204. The third rigid member 209 is located a distance between the first rigid member 201 and both the fourth rigid member 212 and the fifth rigid member 213 and joined with the left-most angled rigid member 207 and the right-most angled rigid member 208. The left-most pad support rigid member 210 is joined with the third rigid member 209 and the fourth rigid member 212. Similarly, the right-most pad support rigid member 211 is joined with the third rigid member 209 and the fifth rigid member 213. When viewed from view A-A, the joined third rigid member 209, fourth rigid member 212, fifth rigid member 213, left-most pad support member 210 and right-most pad support rigid member 211 will form a trapezoidal shape with a missing base. While the combination of joined third rigid member 209, fourth rigid member 212, fifth rigid member 213, left-most pad support member 210 and right-most pad support rigid member 211 will form a trapezoidal shape with a missing base in the preferred embodiment, one skilled in the art will recognize that this feature is preferred but not necessary for the device. The exercise device will function with the fourth rigid member 212 and the fifth rigid member 213 joined as a single rigid member spanning the distance between the left-most angled rigid member 207 and the right-most angled rigid member 208 and with the left-most pad support rigid member 210 and right-most pad support rigid member 211 removed from the device. As depicted in FIG. 3 and FIG. 2., a support pad 300 is mounted onto the structure formed by the right-most angled rigid member 208, the left-most angled rigid member 207, the third rigid member, 209, the fourth rigid member 212, the fifth rigid member 213, left-most pad support member 210 and right-most pad support member 211. The support pad 300 can be made with any material, but will preferably be made with a wooden support material covered with foam and vinyl as is typical in the art to cushion the exerciser's arms. In the preferred embodiment, the support pad will contain a cut-out on the side closest to the fourth rigid member 212 and fifth rigid member 213 and parallel to the third rigid member 209. The cut-out will be sized to provide enough space so that an exerciser's stomach does not prevent the exerciser from performing the exercise in a full range of motion. As depicted in FIG. 1, the exercise device will have a curl bar 400 that spans the distance between the left-most angled rigid member 207 and the right-most angled rigid member 208. The curl bar 400 is mounted on to the left-most angled rigid member 207 and the right-most angled rigid member 208. In the preferred embodiment, the curl bar 400 is curved to support an exerciser's wrists in a manner commonly known as an EZ curl bar. However, the curl bar 400 can be straight or contain any variety of angles. FIG. 1 depicts the exercise device mounted onto a functional training cage 900. The exercise cage 900 depicted in FIG. 1 is an example of exercise cages that are common in the art. The exercise cage 900 generally consists of several rigid members with sets of coaxial holes spaced a distance apart. The device is mounted onto the functional training cage 900 by mounting provisions 500. In the preferred embodiment, the mounting provisions 500 are joined at the junctions of the first rigid member 201, the left-most rigid member 203 and right-most rigid member 204 as well as at the junctions of the second rigid member 202, the left-most rigid member 203 and right-most rigid member 204. In the preferred embodiment, the mounting provisions will consist of two coaxial holes that will accept a pin, bolt or rod that will support the device and the weight of the exerciser. The coaxial holes in the exercise device will be aligned with the coaxial holes in the exercise cage 900 and a pin, bolt or rod will pass through both the coaxial holes in the exercise cage 900 and the exercise device's mounting provisions 500 in order to support the weight of the device and the exerciser. Alternative embodiments include a wall mounted version of the device as depicted in FIG. 5. As depicted in FIG. 5, the mounting provisions 500 are joined to the device with the device supported on a wall by a series of screws or bolts. FIG. 6 depicts an alternate embodiment of the exercise device where the device is a fixed stand-alone unit. As shown in FIG. 6, the support pad 300 and curl bar 400 are mounted onto the fixed stand-alone unit. The frame 600, as depicted, consists of a support base 601, left-most frame extension 602, right-most frame extension 603, left-most pad support 604 and right-most pad support arm 605. As depicted in FIG. 8, the support base 601 extends a distance sufficient to assure that the device remains upright when being used. The left-most frame extension 602 and right-most frame extension 603 are joined to the support base 601 and extend a height sufficient to allow a user to perform the exercise without touching the ground. As depicted in FIG. 8, the left-most frame extension 602 and right-most frame extension 603 are joined to the support base 601 at an angle that positions the user over the support base 601. The left-most pad support arm 604 is joined with the left-most frame extension 602 at the end opposite of the support base 601 and forms an angle preferably between 45 and 55 degrees from the ground. Similarly, the right-most pad support arm 605 is joined with the right-most frame extension 603 at the end opposite of the support base 601 and forms an angle preferably between 45 and 55 degrees from the ground. In this alternate embodiment, the left-most pad support arm 604 and right-most pad support arm 605 are formed so that there are horizontal components that rejoin the left-most frame extension 602 and right-most frame extension 603, respectively, at positions between the opposing ends of the left-most frame extension 602 and right-most frame extension 603. The horizontal components of the left-most pad support 604 and right-most pad support 605 are intended to provide additional structural support for the exercise device. However, one skilled in the art will recognize that the horizontal components of the left-most pad support 604 and right-most pad support 605 are not absolutely necessary for the exercise device. FIG. 7 depicts a rear view of this alternate embodiment of the device. As seen in FIG. 7, a horizontal rigid member 606 is joined to the left-most pad support 604 and right-most pad support 605. A right-most angled rigid member 607 is joined to the horizontal rigid member 606 and the right-most pad support 605. Similarly, a left-most angled rigid member 608 is joined to the horizontal rigid member 606 and the left-most pad support 604. The support pad 300 is mounted onto the left-most pad support 604 and right-most pad support 605 and is structurally supported by the horizontal rigid member 606, right-most angled rigid member 607 and left-most angled rigid member 608. The curl bar 400 is mounted onto the left-most pad support 604 and right-most pad support 605. Although FIGS. 6, 7 and 8 depict the left-most frame extension 602 and right-most frame extension 603 as attached to the end of the support base 601 and forming an angle to position the user over the support base 601, one skilled in the art will recognize that the left-most frame extension 602 and right-most frame extension 603 can be vertical and positioned anywhere on the support base 601 that will maintain the device in the upright position. Although three embodiments of the exercise device are described, one skilled in the art will recognize that this invention includes any embodiment that the support pad 300 and curl bar 400 to be placed in an elevated position so that the exerciser can grasp the curl bar, rest his or her forearms on the support pad and lift himself or herself from the ground. These other embodiments of the device include, but are not limited to, mounting the device onto a doorway, wall, or other exercise device. One skilled in the art will recognize that the device can be mounted by any means necessary to accomplish a particular mounting goal. FIG. 9 depicts an exerciser using the preferred embodiment of the device. The exerciser will grasp the curl bar 400 and rest his or her elbows and forearms on the support pad 300. As shown in FIG. 10, the exerciser will contract his or her forearms, biceps, shoulders and back muscles in an effort to lift herself until her arms are fully contracted. FIG. 11 depicts the upper and lower positions of the exerciser while using the device. 1.
