Comparative Example 19: Synthesis of (S)-3-aminoquinuclidine.diacetate
Toluene solution (28.22 g) containing (S)-3-aminoquinuclidine (3.03 g: 24.0 mmol) was charged into a 50 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and acetic acid (2.86 g: 47.6 mmol) was added thereto while stirring at room temperature. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60° C., to obtain (S)-3-aminoquinuclidine.diacetate (5.02 g: 20.4 mmol, yield=85%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 103° C., 135° C.
