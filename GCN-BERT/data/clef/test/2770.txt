No. 13/395,937 filed on 14 Mar. 2012, which is a 371 U.S. National Stage of International Application No. PCT/EP2010/005600, filed Sep. 13, 2010, which claims priority to German Patent Application No. 10 2009 042 493.8, filed Sep. 14, 2009. The entire disclosures of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference. FIELD The present invention relates to a granulate mixture for regenerating a bone, in particular by means of three-dimensional distraction, methods for three-dimensional callus distraction, and uses of said granulate mixture. BACKGROUND This section provides background information related to the present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art. At the present time, bone losses are generally filled using bone replacement materials, or autogenic or allogenic bone. Examples of bone replacement materials include inorganic materials such as calcium phosphate, hydroxyapatite, or bioglass, which are replaced by bone after a long absorption period. However, this procedure may be used only for minor defects; otherwise, there is the risk of infection due to insufficient vascularization. Such bone materials do not emit biomechanical pulses and therefore do not initiate active regeneration. There are also synthetically manufactured bone replacement materials made of organic materials, such as polyesters, polyamino acids, polyanhydrides, polyorthoesters, polyphosphazenes, polylactides, or polyglycolides, or made of allogenic organic materials, for example of bovine origin. However, bone substance losses may also be compensated for using microvascular connected autogenic or allogenenically vascularized transplants. From a biological standpoint, the best replacement material for bone is an autologous spongiosa transplant. However, such transplants have limited availability and exhibit a high absorption rate after transplantation. The materials and techniques used in the prior art frequently provide unsatisfactory bone quality, resulting, for example, in insecure anchoring of implant beds. In addition, frequently the bone replacement is insufficiently vascularized, thereby increasing the risk of infection. Furthermore, methods of the prior art often use growth factors which greatly increase the costs for the methods. Bone replacement materials are frequently used in the form of a granulated material, in particular in the mouth and jaw region. Such a granulated material is described in WO 2006/010507 A2, for example. Examples of granulated material known on the market include Bio-Oss® from Geistlich Pharma AG, BONITmatrix® from DOT GmbH, and cycIOS® and Ceros® from Mathys AG. Instead of using a bone replacement, missing bone substance may sometimes be filled by bone regeneration. Segmented interruptions in the osseous continuity of long tubular bones may be treated in this manner by distraction osteogenesis. Callus distraction has been known for over a hundred years. The most important biological stimulus for bone formation is mechanical stress. This releases piezoelectric forces which activate the osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Distraction osteogenesis induces new bone formation by triggering biological growth stimuli by means of slow separation of bone segments. This method achieves direct formation of woven bone by distraction. The defined tensile stress is essential for bone formation. When such a defined tensile stress is applied to bone fragments, the mesenchymal tissue exhibits an osteogenetic potential in the gap and at the contiguous fragment ends. When sufficient vascular potency is present, progressive distraction results in metaplasia of the organized hematoma, also referred to as blood coagulum, in a zone of longitudinally arranged fibrous tissue, which under optimal external and internal conditions may be directly converted to woven bone. A complication, however, is that the bone tissue requires highly complex control for regeneration. WO 01/91663 describes a two-dimensionally oriented bone distraction using an artificial interface. For such distraction methods from the prior art, in many cases only vertical regeneration is possible, for example in the jaw region. Thus, bone regeneration by distraction cannot be used for every type of bone defect. In addition, the devices used for distraction are complex, and distraction methods take a comparatively long time. DE 10 2006 047 248 A1 describes a three-dimensional structure which, by a change in volume, transmits pulses directly to osteoblasts and activates same. SUMMARY This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features. The technical object of the present invention is to provide a device which allows bone regeneration methods to be carried out which overcome the disadvantages of the prior art.

According to the invention, the swelling agent is preferably biocompatible. According to the invention, the swelling agent is preferably biodegradable. It may be provided, for example, that the swelling agent is not biogenic, in particular that the swelling agent contains no collagen or is collagen-free.

The casing may be formed from one or multiple biodegradable materials. The undegraded, i.e., intact, casing prevents contact of the swelling agent with a liquid. The swelling agent may come into contact with a liquid after the casing has partially or completely degraded. By selecting the thickness of the casing, one skilled in the art may specify the period of time over which the shell dissolves. It is thus possible to predefine the point in time that distraction begins. The thicker the biodegradable casing, for example, the later the onset of deformation, in particular expansion, of the encased granulated material, and thus, the start of the distraction pulses. The thickness of the casing may be from the thickness of a molecular film up to 5 mm. According to the invention, the casing preferably has at least the thickness of a molecular film. According to the invention, the casing preferably has a maximum thickness of 5 mm, in particular 2 mm, very particularly very 1 mm.

In one embodiment according to the invention, the casing may be composed of at least one gelatin film, for example. However, it may also be provided, for example, that the swelling agent of the at least one deformable, in particular expandable, particle is enclosed by a biodegradable sheathing.

According to the invention, the at least one deformable particle is preferably expandable and/or contractible. According to the invention, the at least one deformable particle is preferably expandable or contractible. According to the invention, the at least one deformable particle is preferably expandable. According to the invention, the deformable particles are preferably expandable particles. According to the invention, the deformable particles are preferably expandable in a predefined and controlled manner as a function of the action of force. According to the invention, the deformable particles are preferably deformable in a predefined and controlled manner as a function of the action of force. According to the invention, the at least one deformable particle is preferably contractible. According to the invention, the deformation of the at least one deformable particle preferably occurs as the result of a change in volume of the particle. In the context of the present invention, the “volume” of the deformable particles and in particular of the swelling agent is understood to mean the volume that is delimited by the outer surfaces of the particles or of the swelling agent. The deformable particles are preferably present in the form of a starting volume, preferably the original starting volume, which is able to change to a different volume as the result of contact with a liquid, in particular as the result of absorption of liquid. A change in the volume means a change in the starting volume, in particular a significant change in the starting volume, preferably an increase in the starting volume. The change may be, for example, a change in the starting volume of at least 1%, preferably 5%, preferably 10%, preferably 15%, preferably 20%, preferably 30%, preferably 40%, preferably 50%, preferably 60%, preferably 70%, preferably 80%, preferably 90%, and in the case of an enlargement, preferably at least 100%, preferably 150%, preferably 200%, or preferably 300%, for example as the result of expansion or deformation of the particles. In one embodiment according to the invention, the deformation, in particular expansion, of a deformable particle takes place in all three spatial directions. In one alternative embodiment according to the invention, the deformation, in particular expansion, takes place directed in one or two spatial directions. In one alternative embodiment according to the invention, the deformation, in particular expansion, takes place directed in one spatial direction. A directed deformation, in particular expansion, may be achieved, for example, by a sheathing, in particular a sheathing having a bellows. However, the directed expansion may also be achieved, for example, by a casing having different thicknesses at different locations, and which therefore dissolves at different rates. In that case, a deformation, in particular expansion, takes place at regions of the swelling agent at which the casing is already dissolved, and not at locations at which the casing has not yet dissolved. According to the invention, the change in volume of the deformable particles as a result of contact with and absorption of liquid, preferably a liquid containing biomolecules and/or cells, particularly preferably blood, is preferably induced by the particles, for example by the swelling agent. According to the invention the liquid is preferably water. According to the invention the liquid is preferably a bodily fluid. According to the invention the liquid is preferably an interstitial liquid. According to the invention the liquid is preferably blood. According to the invention, the absorbed liquid preferably contains no solid constituents larger than 150 kDa, particularly preferably larger than 100 kDa, in particular larger than 50 kDa. According to the invention, the change in volume of the deformable particles is preferably an increase in volume. Provision of the granulate mixture according to the invention allows the granulate mixture to be introduced into a bone defect, for example by surgical means. After introduction into the bone defect, according to the invention the volume of the deformable particles changes, for example increases or decreases, but in particular expands, due to contact with a liquid and associated liquid migration, in particular absorption of the liquid. As a result of the change in volume of the deformable particles, the deformable particles are changed in shape and/or size, particularly preferably the surface and thus the enclosed volume being enlarged. As a result, after introduction of the granulate mixture, osteogenic cells or cell aggregates which have migrated into the bone defect and adhered to the particles, in particular to the deformable particles, and to the nondeformable particles, are slowly exposed in a defined manner to stress, i.e., a biomechanical stimulus, in particular when they are located at a distance from the particles for which distraction is effective. As a result of the defined expansion of the deformable particles in the bone defect and the associated motion of the nondeformable particles and the resulting distraction of cells adhered to the particles, a three-dimensional callus distraction is achieved. In this manner a callus precursor is produced in the entire defect all at once by distraction, and then only needs to ossify. This stimulus is advantageously achieved in essentially a large number of cells, particularly preferably in all cells at the same time. According to the invention, biomechanical stimuli may be transmitted directly to the osteoblasts without the need for fibroblasts. Thus, the distraction may act on the osteoblasts with comparatively small forces. Without being bound to theoretical aspects, the distraction pulses are transmitted to most of the osteoblasts via the nondeformable particles, in particular when more nondeformable particles than deformable particles are present in the granulate mixture, and/or when the nondeformable particles are larger than the deformable particles. The granulate mixture according to the invention may advantageously be used in methods, preferably methods according to the invention, for bone regeneration, in particular for three-dimensional callus distraction. According to the invention, the granulate mixture according to the invention preferably transmits biomechanical pulses, in particular expansion stimuli or pressure stimuli, to the cells surrounding the granulate mixture, so that the cells may be distracted or compressed by distances of at least 0.5 μm in particular 1 μm more preferably 2 μm, most preferably 10 μm to preferably 100 μm, very particularly preferably 1000 μm, more particularly preferably 1 cm, most particularly preferably up to 10 cm. Thus, according to the invention the granulate mixture according to the invention preferably changes in length and/or width of the deformable particles by the above-referenced preferred distances. Biomechanical pulses are transmitted to the surrounding cells by virtue of this preferred change in length and/or width of the deformable particles. For example, cells which adhere to the particles at at least two adhesion points are expanded by the change in dimension. However, cells surrounding the particles may also experience a pressure pulse as a result of the change in dimension of the particles. The pulses may also be transferred via the body's own fibrin network. However, in particular the pulses are relayed to the cells also via the nondeformable particles, since the nondeformable particles which surround the deformable particles in the granulate mixture are likewise moved by the deformation of the deformable particles. Thus, the deformation of the deformable particles not only causes a pulse relay to osteoblasts, but also moves the nondeformable particles surrounding the deformable particles, so that the nondeformable particles may likewise relay pulses to the osteoblasts as a result of the motion. The nondeformable particles are thus able to enlarge the surface for adhesion of the osteoblasts and for transmitting the pulses, which normally are formed only by the deformable particles, to the osteoblasts. This may result in a cost reduction, for example, in particular when the deformable particles are more expensive to manufacture than the nondeformable particles. The pulses may also surprisingly and advantageously be controlled by the size or the size mixtures of the deformable particles and/or of the nondeformable particles, for example controlled in their intensity, duration, and/or speed. The pulses may also surprisingly and advantageously be controlled by the mixing ratio of the deformable particles to the nondeformable particles, for example controlled in their intensity, duration, and/or speed. Thus, one skilled in the art is able to select the composition of the particles in a granulate mixture according to the invention in such a way that the relay of pulses to the cells occurs with regard to the desired parameters, for example with regard to the duration of distraction, the speed of distraction, and/or the intensity of distraction. One skilled in the art is thus able to influence these parameters very easily, namely, by simply changing the size and/or the mixing ratio of the particles in the granulate mixture. In addition, a granulate mixture according to the invention may be easily and inexpensively prepared. For example, conventional nondeformable particles from the prior art may be mixed with the deformable particles without a high expenditure of effort. According to the invention, the biomechanical pulses are preferably transmitted at a maximum distraction rate of 1 mm/day. According to the invention, the expansion stimuli are preferably transmitted at a maximum distraction rate of 1 mm/day. According to the invention, the pressure stimuli are preferably transmitted at a maximum distraction rate of 1 mm/day. According to the invention, the degradation kinetics of the deformable particles are adapted to the time schedule for a distraction to be carried out using the granulate mixture according to the invention. According to the invention, the material of the deformable particles is preferably expandable, contractible, and/or deformable in a predefined and controlled manner as a function of an external action of force. The material may have plastic or elastic properties. These properties of the material enable the capacity, provided according to the invention, of the deformable particles to reversibly or irreversibly change in volume in a predefined and controlled manner. According to the invention, the starting volume of the deformable particles preferably changes at a predetermined rate. According to the invention, the maximum rate at which the starting volume of the deformable particles is able to change is great enough that the cells adhering to the particles, i.e., to the deformable particles and/or to the nondeformable particles, and/or the cells surrounding the particles, are distracted and/or compressed a maximum of 1.5 mm/day, particularly preferably 1.2 mm/day, in particular 1 mm/day, most preferably 0.9 mm/day. In one preferred embodiment, the volume of the deformable particles may change in a predefined and controlled manner at a rate at which expansion or contraction of a volume of 1000 μm3 to 216,000 μm3 occurs at a maximum of 0.6 mm per day in at least one spatial coordinate, particularly preferably a maximum of 0.577 mm per day, in particular a maximum of 0.55 mm per day, most preferably a maximum of 0.5 mm per day. In one preferred embodiment, the volume may change in a predefined and controlled manner at a rate at which expansion or contraction of a volume of 1000 μm3 to 216,000 μm3 occurs in at least one spatial coordinate at a maximum of at least 0.01 mm per day, particularly preferably at least 0.1 mm per day, in particular at least 0.2 mm per day, most preferably at least 0.5 mm per day. In one preferred embodiment, the volume of the deformable particles may change in a predefined and controlled manner at a rate at which expansion or contraction of a section of the body diagonals of the volume of the swelling agent between 10 μm and 60 μm in length occurs at a maximum of 0.6 mm per day, particularly preferably a maximum of 0.577 mm per day, in particular a maximum of 0.55 mm per day, most preferably a maximum of 0.5 mm per day. In one preferred embodiment, the volume may change in a predefined and controlled manner at a rate at which expansion or contraction of a section of the body diagonals of the volume of the swelling agent between 10 and 60 μm in length occurs at least 0.01 mm per day, particularly preferably at least 0.1 mm per day, in particular at least 0.2 mm per day, most preferably at least 0.5 mm per day. According to the invention, the deformable particles are preferably designed in such a way that the starting volume of the deformable particles is able to change continuously. According to the invention, the deformable particles are preferably designed in such a way that the starting volume of the deformable particles is able to change discontinuously. In the context of the present invention, “in a predefined and controlled manner” is understood to mean a change in the starting volume, in particular an expansion or contraction, which occurs over a predetermined distance and/or a predetermined volume, and whose rate, i.e., the expansion rate, contraction rate, or rate of change in volume, is likewise predetermined, i.e., intentionally selected. According to the invention, a change in the volume may also be only a change in the shape of the volume.

The present invention further relates to a method for producing a granulate mixture according to the invention, wherein at least one deformable, in particular expandable, particle, in particular a plurality of deformable, in particular expandable, particles, and at least one nondeformable, in particular nonexpandable, particle, in particular a plurality of nondeformable, in particular nonexpandable, particles, are mixed. The present invention further relates to a method for regenerating a bone, wherein at least one granulate mixture according to the invention is introduced into a defect region of a bone. The present invention further relates to medical procedures in which a granulate mixture according to the invention is used. The invention thus further relates to the first medical indication of a granulate mixture of deformable, in particular expandable, particles and nondeformable, in particular nonexpandable, particles, in particular of a granulate mixture according to the invention. In one embodiment according to the invention, the granulate mixture is introduced into a defect region of a bone in such a way that the at least one deformable, in particular expandable, particle comes into contact with a liquid. In one embodiment according to the invention, the bone defect is revivified before the granulate mixture is introduced. Accordingly, within the scope of the method according to the invention for bone regeneration, in one preferred embodiment a granulate mixture composed of deformable and nondeformable particles, in particular a granulate mixture according to the invention, is introduced into a defect region of a bone. In this defect region the granulate mixture is enclosed by a blood clot; i.e., the surfaces of the particles contact the autologous cells contained in the blood clot. After the granulate mixture has been introduced into the defect region of a bone, a change in volume, i.e., in particular a decrease or increase in volume, of the deformable particles is induced as the result of a liquid. This results in expansion and/or change in shape, and thus, the desired biomechanical stimulation of the osteogenic cells attached to the deformable particles and the nondeformable particles, and thus results in distraction and therefore bone regeneration. According to the invention, the action of force preferably occurs within the body, in particular within the bone defect. According to the invention, the change in volume of the deformable particles may lie in various ranges. The volume change is preferably approximately 10% of the longitudinal expansion of the cells or cell groups adhering to the deformable particles. According to the invention, the change in the expansion distance is preferably at least 0.5 μm, particularly preferably at least 1 μm, more preferably at least 10 μm, even more preferably at least 100 μm, very preferably at least 1000 μm, very particularly preferably at least 10 mm, and most preferably at least 100 mm. According to the invention, the change in the expansion distance is preferably 100 mm maximum, particularly preferably 10 mm maximum, more preferably 1000 μm maximum, even more preferably at least 100 μm maximum, very preferably 10 μm maximum, very particularly preferably 1 maximum, and most preferably 0.5 μm maximum. According to the invention the distraction distance is preferably 5 mm to 10 mm. According to the invention, the distraction force of the deformable particles must preferably be greater than the contraction force of the fibrin framework or of the blood clot. According to the invention, the distraction resulting from the deformation, expansion, or contraction of the deformable particles preferably begins one day after the granulate mixture is introduced into the bone defect. According to the invention, the distraction resulting from the deformation, expansion, or contraction of the deformable particles preferably begins one week after the granulate mixture is introduced into the bone defect. The beginning of the distraction may be specified by a casing of the deformable particles, in particular by the thickness of the casing. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction takes place over a period of several days or weeks. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction takes place over a period of several days. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction takes place over a period of several weeks. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction takes place over a period of at least one day, in particular at least 2 days, and a maximum of 300 days, in particular a maximum of 100 days. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction takes place over a period of at least one day. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction takes place over a period of at least 2 days. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction takes place over a period of at least 5 days. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction takes place over a period of at least 10 days. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction takes place over a maximum period of 300 days. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction takes place over a maximum period of 100 days. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction takes place over a maximum period of 50 days. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction takes place over a period of several days, in particular over a period of 5 to 20 days, particularly preferably over a period of approximately 10 days, in particular 10 days. According to the invention, the rate of change of the volume is at least great enough that cells adhering to the particles are distracted at least 1 μm/day. According to the invention, the maximum rate of change of the volume is great enough that cells adhering to the particles are distracted between 0.5 mm/day and 1 mm/day. According to the invention, the maximum rate of change of the volume is great enough that cells or osteogenic, callus-producing tissue adhering to the particles are distracted a maximum of 1 mm/day. A more rapid distraction rate than 1 mm/day results in differentiation of connective tissue instead of bone. As a result of the change in volume, the deformable particles transmit to the cells contained in the blood clot and adhered to the deformable and nondeformable particles biomechanical stimuli which trigger the body's own regenerative forces, thereby forming new autologous bone material. This new bone material does not differ from the original bone material surrounding the defect. The change in volume of the deformable particles results in biomechanical stimulus transmission throughout the entire space occupied by the granulate mixture, so that a biomechanical stimulus is transmitted to a much larger number of cells than for distraction osteogenesis from the prior art. According to the invention, the biomechanical stimulus is preferably transmitted from the deformable particles directly to osteoblasts, as well as by the nondeformable particles to the osteoblasts. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction takes place in all three spatial directions. In one alternative embodiment according to the invention, the distraction takes place directed in one or two spatial directions. In one alternative embodiment according to the invention, the distraction takes place directed in one spatial direction. Without being bound to theoretical aspects, in some situations it may be advantageous to have the distraction take place directed in one spatial direction so that the distraction follows a possible orientation of the fibers. For a distraction according to the invention, the biomechanical stimuli according to the invention may preferably be transmitted not only directly to osteoblasts adhering to the particles, but also indirectly via fibroblasts. According to the invention, fibroblasts adhering to the particles preferably further transmit the distraction stimulus to osteoblasts in a metered manner. Without being bound to theoretical aspects, after completion of the distraction the fibroblasts in the so-called “null zone” also become osteoblasts and likewise form bone. For a decreasing distraction rate, the number of fibroblasts preceding the osteoblasts changes. In contrast, distraction osteogenesis from the prior art transmits biomechanical stimuli via a two-dimensional interface composed of bone or another material only to cells which directly contact this two-dimensional interface. Without being bound to theoretical aspects, cell distraction as well as tissue distraction may be achieved by the method according to the invention. In conjunction with the present invention, cell distraction is understood to mean the distraction of individual cells, in particular osteoblasts. These individual cells attach to the deformable or nondeformable particles, and experience direct or indirect distraction pulses as a result of the deformation of the deformable particles. In one embodiment according to the invention, a distraction pulse experienced by a cell, in particular an osteoblast, is 1 μm to 10 μm. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction distance a cell, in particular an osteoblast, is pulled is 1 μm to 200 μm.

In one embodiment according to the invention, the rate at which a cell, in particular an osteoblast, is pulled is at least 1 μm/day. In conjunction with the present invention, tissue distraction is understood to mean the distraction of a tissue, for example a bone tissue, in particular a callus. The tissue is thus composed of a plurality of cells, in particular also osteoblasts. The tissue, in particular a callus, attaches to the deformable or nondeformable particles and experiences direct or indirect distraction pulses as a result of the deformation of the deformable particles. In one embodiment according to the invention, a distraction pulse experienced by a tissue, in particular a callus, is 1 μm to 1000 μm. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction distance a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is 10 μm to 30 cm. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction distance a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is 10 μm to 3 cm. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction distance a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is 10 μm to 10 mm. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction distance a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is at least 0.2 mm to a maximum of 5 mm. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction distance a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is at least 10 μm. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction distance a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is at least 100 μm. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction distance a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is at least 1 mm. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction distance a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is 30 cm maximum. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction distance a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is 10 cm maximum.

In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction distance a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is 1 cm maximum. In one embodiment according to the invention, the distraction distance a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is 0.5 cm maximum. In one embodiment according to the invention, the rate at which a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is at least 10 μm/day. In one embodiment according to the invention, the rate at which a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is at least 0.1 mm/day. In one embodiment according to the invention, the rate at which a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is at least 0.25 mm/day. In one embodiment according to the invention, the rate at which a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is 2 mm/day maximum. In one embodiment according to the invention, the rate at which a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is approximately 1 mm/day. In one embodiment according to the invention, the rate at which a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is at least 0.25 mm/day and a maximum of 2 mm/day. In one embodiment according to the invention, the rate at which a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is at least 0.5 mm/day and a maximum of 2 mm/day. In one embodiment according to the invention, the rate at which a tissue, in particular a callus, is pulled is at least 0.5 mm/day and a maximum of 1.5 mm/day. Thus, the invention provides a method in which a granulate mixture composed of deformable particles and nondeformable particles is introduced into a bone defect, and the deformable particles in the bone defect change in volume and/or shape. As a result of the change in volume and/or shape, biomechanical stimuli are transmitted to cells, in particular osteoblasts, present on the outer surfaces of the deformable particles and the nondeformable particles, thereby stimulating the cells to form bone. The device thus transmits biomechanical stimuli for utilization of the body's own regenerative forces. The method according to the invention is therefore a three-dimensional distraction. In the context of the present invention, “three-dimensional distraction” is understood to mean distractive bone regeneration in which biomechanical stimuli are transmitted to a bone fragment not only at the interface, i.e., in two dimensions, but also throughout a given volume, i.e., in three dimensions. According to the invention it may preferably be provided that the distraction occurs along one spatial axis. This may be achieved, for example, by using an alternative embodiment of the deformable particles in which the length of the particles is changed by a bellows, for example. The method according to the invention uses the body's own healing mechanisms as a bioreactor. Thus, the bone formation occurs under natural conditions, so that the necessary aspects such as growth factors, hormones, and cell composition are implicitly taken into account. In this manner the method according to the invention overcomes problems which may arise as a result of the highly complex control for bone regeneration, as well as the problems of a slow and complicated bone regeneration process using distraction methods from the prior art. According to the invention, the bone defect is preferably revivified before the device according to the invention is introduced. According to the invention, in the method according to the invention before the device according to the invention is introduced into a bone defect this defect is preferably surgically revivified, and in particular bleeding is induced. A blood clot forms in the defect as a result of the surgical revivification and the induced bleeding. After the surgical revivification of the bone defect, according to the invention a granulate mixture according to the invention is preferably introduced into the bone defect. The particles are enclosed, in particular completely enclosed, by the blood clot which forms. The deformable particles, for example also the swelling agent forming the particles, preferably come into contact with a liquid, for example the blood in the blood clot. According to the invention, the granulate mixture is introduced into a defect region of a bone in such a way that the swelling agent of the deformable particles comes into contact with a liquid. According to the invention, the deformable particles thus preferably change in volume after a defined point in time. According to the invention, the deformable particles preferably change in volume after one day. According to the invention, the deformable particles preferably change in volume after one week. Without being bound to theoretical aspects, the blood clot does not contract, but instead enlarges corresponding to the increase in volume of the deformable particles. The cells activated by the granulate mixture may be converted to proliferating osteoblasts which produce the extracellular matrix, and a callus may be formed which subsequently ossifies. When the deformable particles according to the invention are preferably biodegradable, the deformable particles are subsequently absorbed and/or metabolized. Thus, the bone defect may be filled with bone tissue which according to the invention is preferably produced by the described biomechanical stimuli from the granulate mixture. According to the invention, growth factors and other substances besides the granulate mixture may preferably be dispensed with. According to the invention, the newly formed bone material preferably differs, if at all, only slightly, either histologically or in its biological or medical value, from the original bone which surrounds it. According to the invention, the absorption time of the deformable particles is approximately 1 to 2 years, particularly preferably approximately 1.5 years, in particular 1.5 years. Since the deformable particles according to the invention are preferably biodegradable, the space resulting from the degradation of the device may be used for the extracellular matrix. According to the invention, the degradation of the deformable particles may preferably be adjusted in such a way that after a few weeks the particles degrade after they have emitted the biomechanical stimuli, and the resulting space is occupied by the extracellular matrix. In one alternative according to the invention, within the scope of the method according to the invention particles are used whose sheathing has cell adhesive properties. The surface of the sheathing particularly preferably has cell adhesive properties. The surface of the sheathing plays a role in the growth of cells from the blood clot. An adhesion of the cells to the sheathing preferred according to the invention may be influenced by virtue of the surface chemistry, surface physics, and surface topography of the sheathing. According to the invention the surface of the sheathing is preferably hydrophilic. For the ingrowing cells, the interaction between the negatively charged cell membrane and the electrical properties of the surface of the sheathing is preferred according to the invention. The present invention further relates to the use of a granulate mixture according to the invention for regenerating a bone, wherein the granulate mixture is introduced into a defect region of a bone. The present invention further relates to the use of deformable, in particular expandable, particles and nondeformable, in particular nonexpandable, particles for producing a granulate mixture, in particular a granulate mixture according to the invention, for regenerating a bone, wherein the granulate mixture is introduced into a defect region of a bone. The present invention further relates to a granulate mixture containing at least one deformable, in particular expandable, particle and at least one nondeformable, in particular nonexpandable, particle, in particular a granulate mixture according to the invention, for use in the regeneration of a bone. The invention further relates to the second medical indication of a granulate mixture composed of deformable, in particular expandable, particles and nondeformable, in particular nonexpandable, particles, in particular of a granulate mixture according to the invention, for regenerating a bone, in particular a bone in the jaw region. The invention further relates to the use of a granulate mixture according to the invention for manufacturing a kit for bone regeneration. The invention further relates to a kit for bone regeneration, containing a plurality of deformable, in particular expandable, particles and a plurality of nondeformable, in particular nonexpandable, particles. The invention relates in particular to a kit for bone regeneration, containing a granulate mixture according to the invention. According to the invention, said kits preferably contain at least one surgical instrument, particularly preferably at least one applicator, for example a syringe, and a capsule for absorption of the granulate mixture. According to the invention the kit preferably contains an instruction manual. According to the invention the kit preferably contains a package, particularly preferably a package which allows sterile storage of the granulate mixture. According to the invention, the components of the kit are associated with the granulate mixture according to the invention. Further devices such as a surgical instrument, an instruction manual, and/or a package may be associated with the granulate mixture according to the invention. According to the invention, preferred and alternative embodiments according to the invention of the granulate mixture according to the invention are also understood to be preferred and alternative embodiments according to the invention of uses according to the invention, and as preferred and alternative embodiments according to the invention of a method according to the invention. According to the invention, preferred and alternative embodiments according to the invention of the methods according to the invention are also understood to be preferred and alternative embodiments according to the invention of the uses according to the invention, and as preferred and alternative embodiments according to the invention of the granulate mixture according to the invention. FIG. 1 shows a kit 100 which contains an applicator syringe 10 made of sterilizable metal, on the open end 20 of which a disposable capsule 30, made of plastic, for example, is attached. The outwardly facing side of the disposable capsule 30 is provided with a protective cap 40. The disposable capsule 30 contains a granulate mixture 50 according to the invention composed of deformable particles and nondeformable particles. The granulate mixture is injected via the syringe into a bone defect (not illustrated), for example in the jaw region. The kit 100 according to the invention is used to inject the granulate mixture 50 into a bone defect. After introduction into the bone defect, as a result of the structure and composition according to the invention of the deformable particles, and due to contact with liquid, the volume of the swelling material of the deformable particles changes, resulting in expansion, contraction, and/or change in shape of the deformable particles. The nondeformable particles and the bone cells which in the meantime have become attached to the deformable particles and nondeformable particles are thus distracted for regeneration of the bone. FIG. 2A shows two deformable particles 51 and multiple nondeformable particles 52 of a granulate mixture 50 in a bone defect 200, specifically, immediately after the granulate mixture 50 has been introduced into the bone defect 200, for example by use of a kit 100. The deformable particles 51 are surrounded by casings 60. The deformable particles may be composed of a swelling agent, for example. After being introduced into the defect 200, the casing, which may be made of gelatin, for example, is biologically decomposed and degraded. FIG. 2B shows the situation after the casings 60 have degraded. The deformable particles 51 then come into direct contact with the liquid, in particular blood, present in the bone defect, thus causing the volume of the deformable particles 51 to become enlarged in the longitudinal axis, as schematically illustrated by the double arrows in FIG. 2B. This change in volume of the deformable particles 51 results in expanded particles 51, as is apparent from FIG. 2C. The expansion causes the surrounding nondeformable particles 52 to be pushed away, resulting in distraction of the cells 80 which have attached and adhered to the deformable particles and nondeformable particles 51/52.
