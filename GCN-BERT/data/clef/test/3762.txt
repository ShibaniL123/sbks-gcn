Multi Purpose Additive for Floor Coating Formulation Description Floor coating formulations require various additives to guarantee coalescence, leveling, plasti- cizing, wetting and drying control properties. Tributoxyethyl phosphate (TBEP) is a fire retardant but also a well known plasticizer and leveling agent with a reasonable performance in floor coating formulations. As tributoxyethyl phosphate (TBEP) contains phosphate, it is not welcome in terms of sustainability and eco-efficiency. Therefore, in the last years a lot of efforts have been done by the floor coating formulators to replace TBEP. US 4,460,734 describes a polymer composition comprising a polyalkoxylated linear aliphatic alcohol as leveling agent and a polymer, usually in form of a water insoluble latex polymer prepared by emulsion polymerisation and dispersed in the aqueous medium. This polymer compo- sition may be used to formulate aqueous polishes, in particular aqueous floor polishes. It is preferred that the linear aliphatic alcohol is polyalkoxylated with at least one compound selected from the group consisting of ethylene oxide, propylene oxide and epichlorohydrin. It is more preferable that the leveling agent is at least one compound selected from the group consisting of polyalkoxylated linear alcohols of formula CH3(CH2)mO(CH2CH20)nH, wherein m and n are integers and n is greater than one. Preferably, m is an integer from 9 to 15, and n is an integer from 2 to 6. The leveling agent may be composed of mixtures of polyalkoxylated linear aliphatic alcohols. In one embodiment it is preferred that the average value of m is about 12.5 and the average value of n is from 2 to 4. It is more preferable that the average value of n is 3.

Comparative example 3 describes the performance of aqueous floor polishes comprising Triton® X-45, which is ethoxylated octylphenol, having an average number ethylene oxide units of 7 to 8.

The Pencil Hardness and the Pendulum Hardness describe the plasticizing properties of an additive. The higher the Pencil Hardness and the lower the Pendulum Hardness, the better are the plasticizing properties. Table 4 shows that the inventive blends 1 to 5 all show at the same time good leveling properties, good plasticizing properties and good water-spot resistance properties. In particular, the inventive blends 1 to 5 all show at the same time a leveling of at least 4 as determined by ASTM D3153-87, a Pencil Hardness of at least 3H as determined by ASTM D3363-05, a Pendulum Hardness of maximum 32 as determined by DIN EN 1522 (2007) and a water-spot resistance of at least 4 as determined by ASTM D1793-92. The comparative additive tributoxyethyl phosphate (TBEP) shows a high leveling of 4 to 5, and a good water-spot resistance of 4, but the plasticizing properties are very poor. The Pencil Hardness is 2H and the Pendulum Hardness is 36. The comparative blends 1 and 2 comprising at least one compound of formula A, but no compound of formula B show a good leveling of 4, but the water-spot resistance is only 3 to 4, and the Pencil Hardness of comparative blend 1 is only 2H. The comparative blends 3 and 4 comprising at least one compound of formula B, but no com- pound of formula A show high plasticizing properties, but a poor leveling of 3, respectively, 3 to 4, and a poor water-spot resistance of 3 to 4. Thus the inventive blends of the present invention show well-balanced leveling, plasticizing and water-spot resistance properties. 1 .
