No. 13/420,511, filed Mar. 14, 2012, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION 1. Field of Invention The present invention relates to waterborne polyurethane with a reactive functional group and a nanocomposite based on the waterborne polyurethane and, more particularly, to waterborne polyurethane with a reactive side-chain group and clay based on the waterborne polyurethane and, more particularly, to waterborne polyurethane added with a small molecular monomer with a reactive functional group to increase the molecular weight and enhance the physical strength, the chemical resistance, the mechanical strength, the hydrolysis resistance, the thermo-tolerance and wear resistance. 2. Related Prior Art Waterborne polyurethane has been developed for about 60 years and commercialized for more than 30 years. Conventionally, to make waterborne polyurethane, polyol and a hydrophilic functional alcohol (or amine) monomer are pre-polymerized in a small amount of hydrophilic solvent and an excessive amount of di-isocyanate, and neutralized by an ionized compound. The hydrophilic solvent may be N-methyl pyrrolidone (“NMP”), methyl ethyl ketone (“MEK”) or acetone. The ionized compound may be carboxylic group/tertiary amine or sodium salt. Thus, the pre-polymer of the polyurethane is ionized. As a molecular chain grows to a certain length, the activity of the terminal isocyanate is considerably reduced. Hydrophilic amine can be used to extend the molecular chain and then enlarge the molecular weight, thus producing waterborne polyurethane dispersion. Early patents related to waterborne polyurethane are mostly focused on processes for making waterborne polyurethane. Recent patents related to waterborne polyurethane are mostly focused on improvement of the physical properties of waterborne polyurethane and applications of waterborne polyurethane. In Taiwanese Patent Nos. 293962 and 262197, waterborne polyurethane dispersion is disclosed for coating, adhering and gluing glass fibers. in Taiwanese Patent No. 228515, polyurethane, polyurethane-polyurea or polyurea dispersion that is self-crosslink at high temperature is used as paste for glass fibers so that the finished glass fibers exhibit improved processability and that plastics enhanced by the glass fibers exhibit improved mechanical properties. In Taiwanese Patent No. 191177, a di-isocyanate uretedione derivative is disclosed for use in waterborne polyurethane. The di-isocyanate uretedione derivative is made by addition aziridine in di-isocyanate uretedione. The physical properties of waterborne polyurethane can be enhanced by a reactive design. For example, disclosed in Taiwanese Patent No. 225495 is polyurethane dispersion of reactive or post-crosslink polyurethane. In Taiwanese Patent No. 197134, there is disclosed waterborne polyurethane lotion and a related coating. Moreover, waterborne polyurethane dispersion derived from blocked aromatic diisocyanate has been disclosed in papers such as U.S. Pat. No. 4,387,181 and Progress in Organic Coatings, 48, 2003, 71-79. In Taiwanese Patent No. 176144, disclosed waterborne polyurethane dispersion. When the temperature reaches a certain degree, isocyanate will be produced and reacts with any substance that contains the hydroxyl group. Such blocked waterborne polyurethane can be used in textile and on wood, paper and plastics. However, to effectively emulsify and disperse the pre-polymer in water, a practical product must include aliphatic or cycloaliphatic di-isocyanate that is lowly water-reactive such as di-isocyanate (“IPDI”), hexamethylene diisocyanate (“HDI”) and bis(cyclohexyl)methylene diisocyanate (“H12MDI”). These compounds are expensive, and their physical properties are no match of solvent-type counterparts because of the structure of aliphatic compounds. However, many organic solvents are used currently such as toluene and dimethylformamide (“DMF”). These compounds pollute the environment and impose hazard to human health. As the environmental protection is getting more attention worldwide and laws and rules are getting tougher against environmental pollution, there is a growing need for low-pollutant and high-performance waterborne resin. To solve the foregoing problems, conventionally, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic di-isocyanate is used at the ends of polyurethane pre-polymer to suppress reaction of the functional group (“NCO”) with water in dispersion and therefore slow down the reduction of the NCO and avoid failure of dispersion. Related techniques can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,193,011, 5,714,561, 5,852,105 and 5,905,113, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0192283 A1, and European Patent Nos. 738,750 and 682,049. In Journal of Polymer Science: Part A: Polymer Chemistry, 2004, 42, 4353-4369, disclosed waterborne polyurethane as methylene di-p-phenyl diisocyanate (“MDI”)/IPDI mixture. The intermolecular forces and physical properties in relation to different concentrations of MDI have been discussed. Disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2003/0027923 A1 and 2005/0020707 A1 is high-performance waterborne polyurethane. Reaction of the functional group (“NCO”) of the aliphatic or cycloaliphatic di-isocyanate with water in dispersion suppress and therefore slow down the reduction of the NCO and avoid failure of dispersion. In the dispersion of prepolymer with aromatic isocyanate as a terminal group, reaction of the functional group of isocyanate with water is suppressed and the molecular chain is effectively extended. Toluene diisocyanate (“TDI”) is used as an initiator without having to use any aliphatic or cycloaliphatic di-isocyanate. By strict control over the concentration of the functional group of NCO in the prepolymerization and the concentration of a chain-extending agent, waterborne polyurethane dispersion is made with excellent physical properties and stability in storage. Except addition of a curing agent and changing the properties of the components, waterborne polyurethane nanocomposites have been widely studied, e.g., Macromolecules, 2006, 39, 6133 and Journal of Polymer Science: Part A: Polymer Chemistry, 2006, 44, 5801. Clay is lamination of silicate layers and an abundant, inexpensive inorganic material in the nature. Clay exhibits advantages such as excellent mechanical properties, thermo-tolerance, chemical resistance and a low expansion coefficient, and therefore is often used as an enhancing material for polymers. However, unmodified clay is hydrophilic and poorly compatible with polymers that are hydrophobic, and the silicate layers tend to be aggregated and cannot be evenly distributed. However, the clay is hydrophilic in nature and lacks the affinity for hydrophobic organic polymers. To improve its miscibility with polymers, the clay must be modified to become organophilic by widening the interlayer spacing with surfactants. In 1987, Toyota released a nanometer dispersed clay/nylon nanocomposite the first time. Since then, there have been some patents related to nanometer clay/waterborne polyurethane composites. In Taiwanese Patent No. 230181 for example, a method is disclosed for making waterborne polyurethane/clay nanocomposites. C6˜C18 alkyl diamine are used to modify clay, the modified clay is used with waterborne polyurethane to form a pre-polymer, and they form a stable dispersion after the molecular chain is extended. In Taiwanese Patent No. 263628 for example, a method is disclosed for making modified clay and polyurethane resin/clay nanocomposites. A lipophilic modifier and a reactive modifier of a structure that includes —OH and —NH are used. The reactive modifier includes a functional group for reacting with polyurethane resin. The gallery between two adjacent layers of the modified clay is increased to 14.6 to 60 Å. In the composites and dispersion, the gallery between two adjacent layers of the modified clay can be increased by 5 to 10 Å, and the tensile strength and wear-resistance are increased. In Taiwanese Patent No. 165322, a method is disclosed for modifying clay by a multi-functional organic material and an elastic nanometer clay/polyurethane composite made of polyurethane and multi-functional reactive organic clay to considerably increase the thermo-tolerance and mechanical properties of polyurethane but reduce the water-absorption of polyurethane. In Taiwanese Patent No. 261594, a method is disclosed for making dispersion of waterborne polyurethane/clay nanocomposites and its use in coating. Nanometer clay is modified by long alkyl or quaternary ammonium salt and used as a flame retardant, and mixed and polymerized with synthetic polyurethane to produce waterborne polyurethane with flame-retardant property. In addition, 50˜75 wt % of unmodified clay that is hydrophilic can be added into the waterborne polyurethane. Hydrophilic, suspended, stable, composite emulsion is flame-retardant, and the clay renders the coating more flame-retardant and increases the tensile strength of the coating without jeopardizing the adhesiveness of the emulsion. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,203,901, disclosed are composite fibers and coating materials that include polyurethane resin and nanometer delaminated clay. The clay is modified by quaternary onium salts such as ammonium salts, phosphonium salts and sulphonium salts. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,533,975, a method is disclosed to prepare nanocomposites and films that include polyurethane resin and delaminated clay. The polyurethane/clay dispersion is made of aprotic polar solvents such as dimethylacetamide by solution intercalation. Hence, nanometer laminated inorganic polymer composites increase mechanical strength, thermostability, flame-retardant ability, solvent-resistance and gas barrier ability. None of the foregoing papers is focused on using reactive monomer with selective reactivity to modify organic/inorganic clay and using the modified clay to make clay/waterborne polyurethane composites. Hence, there is still room for improving the physical properties of waterborne polyurethane. The present invention is therefore intended to obviate or at least alleviate the problems encountered in prior art.

FIG. 8 is a scheme illustrating a method for producing modified clay. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Referring to FIGS. 1 to 3, there is shown a method for making waterborne polyurethane with a reactive functional group and a nanocomposite based on the waterborne polyurethane chemistry. At first, by pre-polymerization, a short-chain diol monomer 10 with a reactive functional group is introduced into the backbone of a polyurethane polymer to provide a polyurethane pre-polymer 11. The polyurethane pre-polymer 11 reacts with amine for chain extension and inner-crosslink, thus providing inter-crosslink, waterborne polyurethane dispersion 12. Furthermore, a short-chain diol monomer of a tertiary amine structure can be used as an intercalation modifier for modifying clay to provide organic modified clay 13. Except retaining the reactive properties of azetidine-2,4-dione, it can react with a polyurethane pre-polymer to provide a waterborne polyurethane/clay nanocomposite 14 by in-situ polymerization. The compound of structural formula (I) is a short-chain diol monomer containing a tertiary amine structure, and can be used as a clay intercalation modifier for modifying layered clay, and can be used with the polyurethane pre-polymer to make a nanocomposite via in-situ polymerization, wherein A is and B is With reference to FIG. 8, “modified clay” can be produced when a short-chain diol monomer containing a tertiary amine structure is used as a clay intercalation modifier for modifying layered clay. This can be used with the polyurethane prepolymer to make nanocomposites via in situ polymerization. Thus, a short-chain diol monomer such as Compound I-2 in the examples is fit for such modification. The scheme in FIG. 8 illustrates the process toward “modified clay”. Referring to FIG. 2, the polyurethane pre-polymer 11 is dispersed in water, and branching and entanglement between molecules are increased via hydrophilic amine chain extension and inter-crosslink, thus increasing the mechanical properties, wear-resistance, thermal properties and hydrolysis resistance. The hydrophilic amine may be hydrophilic di-amine such as ethylene diamine (“EDA”), butylene diamine (“BDA”), hexylene diamine (“HAD”) and isophorone diamine (“IPDA”). Referring to FIG. 3, the short-chain diol compounds I-2 and I-4, each of which includes an active tertiary amine was acidified by an equimolar ratio of hydrochloric acid (HCl) and then ion-exchange with montmorillonite (“MMT”). In the layered configuration of nanometer clay, an exfoliation of the layered structure through organic ion exchange is considerably difficult because of the intensive platelet ionic attraction. The clay is modified by exchange of ions, and a short-chain diol monomer is embedded in the modified clay for in situ polymerization. Thus, the layered structure of the clay is completely dispersed, and an organic/inorganic nanocomposite is made. Examples of the method of the invention will be described. EXAMPLE 1 Short-Chain Diol Compound I-1 Methylene di-p-phenyl diisocyanate (“MDI”) and isobutyryl chloride are dissolved in xylene and triethylamine (“TEA”) to provide a monomer, i.e., IDD (4-isocyanato-4′(3,3-dimethyl-2,4-dioxo-azetidino)diphenylmethane). The reaction is represented by the following chemical formula: Then, 11.4 grams of IDD [4-isocyanato-4′(3,3-dimethyl-2,4-dioxo-azetiddino)diphenylmethane] and 3 grams of diethanolamine (“DEA”) are dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (“THF”) at 0° C. for 3 to 4 hours to provide a dual-functional, short-chain diol compound I-1. For several times, cyclohexane is used to wash away excessive reactants and impurities so that a white solid is obtained, at a yield of 87%. The reaction is represented by the following chemical formula: EXAMPLE 2 Short-Chain Diol Compound I-2 11.4 grams of IDD and 4.5 grams of N-(3-Aminopropyl)diethanolamine, (“APDEA”) are dissolved in THF at 0° C. for 3 to 4 hours to make a dual-functional, short-chain diol compound I-2. For several times, cyclohexane is used to wash away excessive reactants and impurities to obtain a white solid at a yield of 85%. The reaction is represented by the following chemical formula: EXAMPLE 3 Short-chain Diol Compound I-3 IDD and DEA are used to make 10 grams of short-chain diol compound I-1. 1.72 grams of N-butyl amine (“C4H9NH2”) is used to execute ring-opening at the end of the short-chain diol compound I-1 to make short-chain diol compound I-3 without any reactive terminal group. For several times, cyclohexane is used to wash away excessive reactants and impurities so that a white solid is obtained, at a yield of 80%. The reaction is represented by the following chemical formula: EXAMPLE 4 Modified Clay FIG. 8 shows a process for producing the modified clay. A short-chain diol monomer such as compound 1-2 is fit for such modification. The short-chain diol monomer containing a tertiary amine structure can be used for a clay intercalation modifier for modifying layered clay, and can be used with a polyurethane prepolymer to make a nanocomposite via in situ polymerization. The intercalation modifier for the layered clay increases the gallery between two adjacent layers of the layered clay to increase the organic compatibility so that the gallery is about 25.5 to about 30.5 Å. The short-chain diol compound I-2, with an active tertiary amine, is used to modify cation clay such as MMT so that the gallery between two adjacent layers of the clay is expanded. 5.796 grams of the short-chain diol compound I-2 is dissolved in a proper amount of THF, neutralized by equivalent hydrochloric acid (HCl: 37.5%, 1.168 grams), and introduced into clay paste that has been swelled by hot water (10 grams of clay/1 liter of de-ionized water) at 60° C. to 80° C. for intercalation for 8 hours. Then, the modified clay is filtered and washed by de-ionized water and THF for several times, and baked at 100° C. The organic modification of the clay is executed according to a process shown in FIG. 3. EXAMPLE 5 Inter-crosslink Waterborne Polyurethane 18.65 grams of isophorone diisocyanate (“IPDI”), 35 grams of polytetramethylene ether glycol (“PTMEG”; molecular weight 2000), 3 grams of dimethylol propionic acid (“DMPA”) and 10.77 grams of the compound I-1 are dissolved in 15 grams of acetone or methyl ethyl ketone (“MEK”). A drop of T-12 catalyst is added into the solution, and the solution is stirred mechanically at 60˜70° C. with nitrogen introduced therein for 3.5 hours. Then, the solution is cooled to 50° C. Then, 2.22 grams of triethylamine (“TEA”) is added into the solution for reaction for 15 minutes. The solution is quickly stirred while 140 grams of de-ionized water is added into the solution and evenly emulsified. Then, 1.86 grams of ethylene diamine (“EDA”) is dissolved in 5 grams of water for chain extension and inter-crosslink. Thus, there is provided waterborne polyurethane dispersion with 30% of solid. The di-isocyanate:polyol:DMPA proportion is 4.8:1:1.26. By changing the weight proportion of the compound I-1 and the ethylene diamine, waterborne polyurethane with different inter-crosslink degree are made. EXAMPLE 6 Post-crosslinkable Waterborne Polyurethane In a process and at a proportion similar to that of Example 5, a short-chain diol such as ethylene glycol is used to replace the chain-extending agent of ethylene diamine, not the announced inter-crosslink structure. The reaction lasts for 12 hours, and a proper amount of acetone or MEK is used to adjust the viscosity. Then, neutralization and emulsification are executed to provide waterborne polyurethane dispersion with 25% to 30% of solid. By changing the proportion of the compound I-1 and the short-chain diol, waterborne polyurethane are made with different physical properties. When a film is made, half-normal short-chain diol such as ethylene diamine is used for post-curing with azetidine-2,4-dione functional group at the side chain. EXAMPLE 7 Layered Clay/Waterborne Polyurethane 18.65 grams of isophorone diisocyanate, 35 grams of polyester-type polyol RS-956 [poly(ethylene butylene adipated)diol; molecular weight 2000], 3 grams of DMPA and 1.56 grams of ethylene glycol are heated and dissolved in 15 grams of cosolvent such as acetone, MEK and N-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidone (“NMP”). A drop of T-12 catalyst is added into the solution, and the solution is stirred mechanically at 60˜70° C. with nitrogen introduced therein for 2 to 2.5 hours. Then, the solution is added with the modified clay (3.5 grams of compound I-2/MMT, about 5 wt %, about 0.05 mole must be included in the equivalent of the short-chain diol). A proper amount of solvent is used to adjust the dispersion and viscosity. After 2 to 3 hours, the solution is cooled to 50° C. Then, 2.22 grams of TEA is used to neutralize the solution. After 15 minutes, the solution is quickly stirred while 160 grams of de-ionized water is added into the solution of emulsification and even dispersion. Then, 1.31 grams of ethylene diamine dissolved in 5 grams of water was added. The filling is executed slowly for chain extension and inter-crosslink to provide nanometer clay/waterborne polyurethane dispersion with 30 wt % of solid. The isophorone diisocyanate:polyol:DMPA proportion is 4.8:1:1.26. By changing the proportion of the diol, ethylene glycol and ethylene diamine and the content of modified clay, a series of clay/waterborne polyurethane nanocomposites are made. COMPARABLE EXAMPLE 1 Linear Waterborne Polyurethane In a process and at a proportion similar to that of Example 5, 1.56 grams of ethylene glycol are used to replace the compound I-1, and the amount of the ethylene diamine is changed to be 1.15 grams, and the amount of the de-ionized water is changed to be 145 grams. The final concentration of the solid is about 30%. By changing the proportion of the ethylene glycol and ethylene diamine, conventional waterborne polyurethane resins are made. COMPARABLE EXAMPLE 2 Side-chain Hard Segment Waterborne Polyurethane In a process and at a proportion similar to that of Example 5, 12.55 grams of the short-chain diol compound I-3 are used instead of the compound I-1, and the amount of the ethylene diamine is changed to be 1.17 grams, and the amount of the de-ionized water is changed to be 153 grams. The final concentration of solid is about 30%. By changing the proportion of the compound I-3 and the ethylene diamine, waterborne polyurethane resins with increased side-chain hard segment proportion are made. The compositions of the waterborne polyurethane and colloid of the present invention are listed in Table 1.

In FIG. 4, “L” represents the linear waterborne polyurethane, and “S” represents the side-chain hard segment waterborne polyurethane, and “N” represents the inter-crosslink waterborne polyurethane. The entire state of the waterborne polyurethane soft/hard segment is shown in AFM phase of the waterborne polyurethane polymer. By the variation in color, the distribution of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic components and hard and soft components can be understood. The topographies are shown. It is observed that microphase separation is irrelevant to the roughness on the surface. It is also observed that phase separation gets higher with the crosslink. Observed in the AFM, there is no obvious microphase separation in the side-chain hard segment (S-series) polyurethane and linear (L-series) polyurethane.

The phase separation of the inter-crosslink (N-series) polyurethane increases with the crosslink degree, and the higher crosslinked N15 is the most obvious case. There is no obvious phase separation in the side-chain hard segment (S-series) polyurethane.

In Table 2, integrated area difference, i.e., the retention %, is shown. The problem of the declining of the physical properties is reduced in the inter-crosslink waterborne polyurethane film. It is evidenced that the introduction of the reactive monomer of the present invention is beneficial for the performance of the polymer. By introducing the monomer into the polyurethane polymer, the mechanical properties and hydrolysis resistance of the product is enhanced. Moreover, the monomer is introduced into the nanometer clay to provide a composite as a factor for controlling the physical properties of the polymer. Referring to FIG. 6, the results of the de-lamination after the in-situ polymerization are shown. The compositions and the physical properties of the films are also listed in Table 3. Referring to FIG. 7, tests are run on the tensile strength of the clay composite. It is observed that the extension of the dry polyurethane film is reduced and the fracture is moved toward the left as the clay is introduced. That is, the mechanical properties of the film are improved. A straight line is used to represent the waterborne polyurethane, and a phantom line is used to represent waterborne polyurethane/1 wt % clay, and a dotted line is used to represent the waterborne polyurethane/3 wt % clay, and a chain line is used to represent the waterborne polyurethane/5 wt % clay. In Table 3, the NMP (10 wt % to 15 wt %) is used as the cosolvent, and the final concentration of solid is 30 wt %, and the MDI/(MDI+IPDI) molecular proportion is 35% to 40%.

The waterborne polyurethane and the nanometer clay composite can be used in building materials such as furniture, walls, adhesion and paint. The multi-functional diols with reactive azetidine-2,4-dione functional group could be embedded into waterborne polyurethane structure, serving as chain-extender, hard segment of polyurethane, crosslinking sites, and reactive modifier of montmorillonite.
