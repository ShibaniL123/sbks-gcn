Step B:1,6-Siamino-2-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-1-ium 2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate. To a cooled (−5° C.) solution of TFA (429 mL) and water (45 mL) was added ethyl (1E)-N-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)sulfonyloxyethanimidate (124 g, 435 mmol), and the mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 1.5 h. Ice water (500 mL) was added, and the resulting precipitate was filtered and washed with water (2×50 mL). The solid was dissolved in DCM (500 mL), dried over Na2SO4, and filtered. The filtrate was added dropwise to a cooled (0° C.) suspension of 6-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridin-2-amine (57 g, 290 mmol) in DCM (500 mL). After stirring at rt for 1 h, the reaction mixture was poured into MTBE (200 mL) and then filtered. The filter cake was washed with MTBE (3×50 mL) and dried under vacuum. The solid was triturated with 5:1 DCM/MeOH (300 mL) for 3 h and filtered. The filter cake was washed with DCM (2×150 mL) and dried under vacuum to afford the title compound as a gray solid (75 g, 61%).
