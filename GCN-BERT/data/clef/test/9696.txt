Example 12
Acetal 1m:
A 2-dram vial with a PTFE-lined cap was charged with alcohol 8m (201 mg, 0.668 mmol) and benzoate S1 (266 mg, 0.914 mmol). These were dissolved in DCE (2.30 mL), and TFA (5.2 μL, 0.0702 mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was heated to 80° C. and stirred for 5.5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was then dissolved in MeOH (3.00 mL) and CH2Cl2 (3.00 mL), K2CO3 (194 mg, 1.41 mmol) was added, and the resulting mixture was stirred at 23° C. for 13 h. The mixture was then filtered through a short pad of silica gel, eluting with EtOAc (30 mL), and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (5:1:1 hexanes/EtOAc/CH2Cl2 eluent) to afford acetal 1m (257 mg, 82% yield, Rf=0.39 in 3:1 hexanes/EtOAc) as a white solid.
