The present invention generally relates to benzodiazepinone compounds useful as Notch inhibitors. The invention further pertains to pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound according to the invention that is useful for the treatment of conditions related to the Notch pathway, such as cancer and other proliferative diseases. Notch signaling has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, such as cell fate specification, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. (Bray, Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology, 7:678-689 (2006); Fortini, Developmental Cell, 16:633-647 (2009)). The Notch proteins are single-pass heterodimeric transmembrane molecules. The Notch family includes 4 receptors, NOTCH 1-4, which become activated upon binding to ligands from the DSL family (Delta-like 1, 3, 4 and Jagged 1 and 2). The activation and maturation of NOTCH requires a series of processing steps, including a proteolytic cleavage step mediated by gamma secretase, a multiprotein complex containing Presenilin 1 or Presenilin 2, nicastrin, APH1, and PEN2. Once NOTCH is cleaved, NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD) is released from the membrane. The released NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it functions as a transcriptional activator in concert with CSL family members (RBPSUH, “suppressor of hairless”, and LAG1). NOTCH target genes include HES family members, such as HES-1. HES-1 functions as transcriptional repressors of genes such as HERP1 (also known as HEY2), HERP2 (also known as HEY1), and HATH1 (also known as ATOH1). The aberrant activation of the Notch pathway contributes to tumorigenesis. Activation of Notch signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various solid tumors including ovarian, pancreatic, as well as breast cancer and hematologic tumors such as leukemias, lymphomas, and multiple myeloma. The role of Notch inhibition and its utility in the treatment of various solid and hematological tumors are described in Miele, L. et al., Current Cancer Drug Targets, 6:313-323 (2006); Bolos, V. et al., Endocrine Reviews, 28:339-363 (2007); Shih, I-M. et al., Cancer Research, 67:1879-1882 (2007); Yamaguchi, N. et al., Cancer Research, 68:1881-1888 (2008); Miele, L., Expert Review Anticancer Therapy, 8:1197-1201 (2008); Purow, B., Current Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, 10:154-160 (2009); Nefedova, Y. et al., Drug Resistance Updates, 11:210-218 (2008); Dufraine, J. et al., Oncogene, 27:5132-5137 (2008); and Jun, H. T. et al., Drug Development Research, 69:319-328 (2008).

When numbers appear in a subscript after the symbol “C”, the subscript defines with more specificity the number of carbon atoms that a particular group may contain. For example, “C1-6 alkyl” denotes straight and branched chain alkyl groups with one to six carbon atoms. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. The compounds of Formula (I) can be provided as amorphous solids or crystalline solids. Lyophilization can be employed to provide the compounds of Formula (I) as a solid. It should further be understood that solvates (e.g., hydrates) of the Compounds of Formula (I) are also within the scope of the present invention. The term “solvate” means a physical association of a compound of Formula (I) with one or more solvent molecules, whether organic or inorganic. This physical association includes hydrogen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable of isolation, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline solid. “Solvate” encompasses both solution-phase and isolable solvates. Exemplary solvates include hydrates, ethanolates, methanolates, isopropanolates, acetonitrile solvates, and ethyl acetate solvates. Methods of solvation are known in the art. The compound of Formula (I) is intended to include solvates of compounds of Formula (I). Any compound that can be converted in vivo to provide the bioactive agent (i.e., the compound of Formula (I)) is a prodrug within the scope and spirit of the invention. Various forms of prodrugs are well known in the art and are described in: a) Wermuth, C. G. et al., The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, Chapter 31, Academic Press (1996);b) Bundgaard, H. ed., Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier (1985);c) Bundgaard, H., Chapter 5, “Design and Application of Prodrugs”, Krogsgaard-Larsen, P. et al., eds., A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, pp. 113-191, Harwood Academic Publishers (1991); andd) Testa, B. et al., Hydrolysis in Drug and Prodrug Metabolism, Wiley-VCH (2003). In addition, compounds of Formula (I), subsequent to their preparation, can be isolated and purified to obtain a composition containing an amount by weight equal to or greater than 99% of a compound of Formula (I) (“substantially pure”), which is then used or formulated as described herein. Such “substantially pure” compounds of Formula (I) are also contemplated herein as part of the present invention. “Stable compound” and “stable structure” are meant to indicate a compound that is sufficiently robust to survive isolation to a useful degree of purity from a reaction mixture, and formulation into an efficacious therapeutic agent. The present invention is intended to embody stable compounds. “Therapeutically effective amount” is intended to include an amount of a compound of the present invention alone or an amount of the combination of compounds claimed or an amount of a compound of the present invention in combination with other active ingredients effective to act as an inhibitor to a NOTCH receptor, or effective to treat or prevent proliferative diseases such as cancer. As used herein, “treating” or “treatment” cover the treatment of a disease-state in a mammal, particularly in a human, and include: (a) preventing the disease-state from occurring in a mammal, in particular, when such mammal is predisposed to the disease-state but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (b) inhibiting the disease-state, i.e., arresting its development; and/or (c) relieving the disease-state, i.e., causing regression of the disease state. The compounds of the present invention are intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include deuterium (D) and tritium (T). Isotopes of carbon include 13C and 14C. Isotopically-labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described herein, using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent otherwise employed. Compounds in accordance with Formula (I) can be administered by any means suitable for the condition to be treated, which can depend on the need for site-specific treatment or quantity of Formula (I) compound to be delivered. Also embraced within this invention is a class of pharmaceutical compositions comprising at least one compound of Formula (I); and one or more non-toxic, pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers and/or diluents and/or adjuvants (collectively referred to herein as “carrier” materials) and, if desired, other active ingredients. The compounds of Formula (I) may be administered by any suitable route, preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition adapted to such a route, and in a dose effective for the treatment intended. The compounds and compositions of the present invention may, for example, be administered orally, mucosally, or parentally including intravascularly, intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly, and intrasternally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles. For example, the pharmaceutical carrier may contain a mixture of mannitol or lactose and microcrystalline cellulose.

In addition, dispersible powders and granules can also contain at least one excipient, including, but not limited to, for example, sweetening agents; flavoring agents; and coloring agents. An emulsion of at least one compound of Formula (I) can, for example, be prepared as an oil-in-water emulsion. The oily phase of the emulsions comprising compounds of Formula (I) may be constituted from known ingredients in a known manner. The oil phase can be provided by, but is not limited to, for example, a vegetable oil, such as, for example, olive oil and arachis oil; a mineral oil, such as, for example, liquid paraffin; and mixtures thereof. While the phase may comprise merely an emulsifier, it may comprise a mixture of at least one emulsifier with a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Suitable emulsifying agents include, but are not limited to, for example, naturally-occurring phosphatides, e.g., soy bean lecithin; esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, such as, for example, sorbitan monooleate; and condensation products of partial esters with ethylene oxide, such as, for example, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. Preferably, a hydrophilic emulsifier is included together with a lipophilic emulsifier which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with or without stabilizer(s) make-up the so-called emulsifying wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily dispersed phase of the cream formulations. An emulsion can also contain a sweetening agent, a flavoring agent, a preservative, and/or an antioxidant. Emulsifiers and emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the present invention include Tween 60, Span 80, cetostearyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, sodium lauryl sulfate, glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax, or other materials well known in the art.

Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed, including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables. A sterile injectable oil-in-water microemulsion can, for example, be prepared by 1) dissolving at least one compound of Formula (I) in an oily phase, such as, for example, a mixture of soybean oil and lecithin; 2) combining the Formula (I) containing oil phase with a water and glycerol mixture; and 3) processing the combination to form a microemulsion.

Methods of Preparation The compounds of the present invention can be prepared in a number of ways well known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. The compounds of the present invention can be synthesized using the methods described below, together with synthetic methods known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferred methods include, but are not limited to, those described below. All references cited herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference. The compounds of this invention may be prepared using the reactions and techniques described in this section. The reactions are performed in solvents appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and are suitable for the transformations being effected. Also, in the description of the synthetic methods described below, it is to be understood that all proposed reaction conditions, including choice of solvent, reaction atmosphere, reaction temperature, duration of the experiment and work up procedures, are chosen to be the conditions standard for that reaction, which should be readily recognized by one skilled in the art. It is understood by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on various portions of the molecule must be compatible with the reagents and reactions proposed. Such restrictions to the substituents that are compatible with the reaction conditions will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art and alternate methods must then be used. This will sometimes require a judgment to modify the order of the synthetic steps or to select one particular process scheme over another in order to obtain a desired compound of the invention. It will also be recognized that another major consideration in the planning of any synthetic route in this field is the judicious choice of the protecting group used for protection of the reactive functional groups present in the compounds described in this invention. An authoritative account describing the many alternatives to the trained practitioner is Greene et al. (Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Wiley and Sons (1999)). Compounds of Formula (I) may be prepared by reference to the methods illustrated in the following Schemes. As shown therein the end product is a compound having the same structural formula as Formula (I). It will be understood that any compound of Formula (I) may be produced by the schemes by the suitable selection of reagents with appropriate substitution. Solvents, temperatures, pressures, and other reaction conditions may readily be selected by one of ordinary skill in the art. Starting materials are commercially available or readily prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art. Constituents of compounds are as defined herein or elsewhere in the specification. The synthesis of the compounds of Formula (I) can be made using the methods summarized in Schemes 1 to 8. The synthesis of aminobenzophenone intermediate iv may be accomplished by several methods skilled to one in the art, summarized in Schemes 1 to 2. Step 1 of Scheme 1 may be accomplished by treatment of a suitably functionalized anthranilic acid i, readily available to one skilled in the art, with acetic anhydride at a suitable temperature, such as 180° C., to give intermediate ii. Step 2: Intermediate ii may be transformed to aminobenzophenone iv by treatment with a functionalized organometallic reagent iii. For example, intermediate ii may be treated with a Grignard reagent iii (M═MgBr) in a solvent such as diethyl ether to give acetylated aminobenzophenone iv (R3═Ac). The acetyl group may then be removed by many methods known to one skilled in the art, such as treatment with HCl in a solvent such as ethanol at a suitable temperature, such as 100° C., to give aminobenzophenone iv. Step 1 of Scheme 2 may be accomplished by a number of methods known to one skilled in the art. For example, treatment of a suitably functionalized aniline v, readily available to one skilled in the art, with a suitable Lewis acid such as boron trichloride, followed by treatment with another Lewis acid, such as aluminum trichloride, and a suitably functionalized nitrile vi in an appropriate solvent such as toluene at an appropriate temperature such as 60° C. gives an imine intermediate, which forms aminobenzophenone iv upon treatment under appropriate hydrolysis conditions, such as treatment with hydrochloric acid. The preparation of benzodiazepinone (vii) may be accomplished in multitude of methods known to one skilled in the art. For example, as shown in Scheme 3, an appropriately substituted 2-aminobenzophenone (iv) (for example, from Walsh, D. A., Synthesis, 677 (1980); and references cited therein, or other methods known to one skilled in the art) may be coupled to the protected glycine derivative (v) (PG=protecting group, for example PG=CBz, see Katritzky, A. R. et al., Org. Chem., 55:2206-2214 (1990)), treated with a reagent such as ammonia and subjected to cyclization to afford the benzodiazepinone (vi), according to the procedure outlined in the literature (for example Sherrill, R. G. et al., J. Org. Chem., 60:730 (1995); or other routes known to one skilled in the art). The resulting racemic mixture may be separated (using procedures known to one skilled in the art) to get the individual enantiomers, or used as a racemate. Step 2: The deprotection of (vi) may be accomplished in several ways known to one skilled in the art. For example, with PG=CBz, Compound (vi) may be treated with a reagent such as HBr in a solvent such as AcOH. Compound (vii) may be used as a racemate. Alternatively, compound (vii) may be subjected to enantiomeric resolution using standard methods (e.g., chiral preparative chromatography). The preparation of tricyclic benzodiazepinone (x) may be accomplished in multitude of methods known to one skilled in the art. For example, as shown in Scheme 4. Step 1: An appropriately substituted benzodiazepinone (vi) may be coupled to (viii) bearing two suitable leaving groups. For example, with LG=Br, in the presence of a base such as Cs2CO3 in a solvent such as DMF, at room temperature under an inert atmosphere such as N2 to afford (ix). Step 2: The deprotection of (ix) may be accomplished in several ways known to one skilled in the art. For example, with PG=Boc, Compound (ix) may be treated with a reagent such as TFA in a solvent such as CH2Cl2 to give x. Compound (x) may be used as a racemate. Alternatively, compound (x) may be subjected to enantiomeric resolution using standard methods (e.g., chiral preparative chromatography). Step 1: The first step of Scheme 5 is accomplished by converting compound (xi) to the ester (xiii), employing one of the multiple ways known to one skilled in the art, such as treatment with a substituted acetimidate such as compound (xii) in the presence of a reagent such as boron trifluoride etherate at an appropriate temperature in a solvent such as THF. Step 2: Acid (xiv) can be converted to compound (xv) in multiple ways known to one skilled in the art. For example, treatment of acid (xiv) with a reagent such as oxalyl chloride in a solvent such as DCM gives the acid chloride (xv, X═Cl). Compound (xv) can be treated with an oxazolidinone (xvi) under standard conditions to give compound (xvii) (Evans, D. A. et al., J. Am. Chem Soc., 112:4011 (1990)). Step 3: Compound (xvii) can be converted to compound (xviii) in multiple ways (Baran, P. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 130(34):11546 (2008)). For example, compound (xiii) is treated with a base such as LDA in a solvent such as toluene, at low temperature such as −78° C. under an inert atmosphere such as N2. The resulting mixture is added to a solution of compound (xvii) treated with lithium chloride and a base such as LDA in a solvent such as toluene under an inert atmosphere such as N2. To the resulting mixture of the enolates of compounds (xiii) and (xvii) is added bis(2-ethylhexanoyloxy) copper at a low temperature such as −78° C. under an inert atmosphere such as N2 and warmed to room temperature to provide compound (xviii). Step 4: Conversion of compound (xviii) to (xix) may be accomplished by treating it with hydrogen peroxide and lithium hydroxide at an appropriate temperature using a mixture of solvents such as THF/water. If necessary, the diastereomers may be separated at this point via silica gel chromatography or preparative HPLC. Alternately, the mixture may be subjected to epimerization conditions, for example by treatment with LDA and diethylaluminum chloride followed by quenching with methanol or acetic acid to enrich the desired diastereomer. Step 5: If desired, the desired (R,S)-diastereomer may be obtained in pure form by a series of steps involving protection of the carboxylic acid, separation of the diastereomers and deprotection, common steps known to one skilled in the art. For example, the mixture of diastereomers (xix) can be protected as the benzyl ester by treating with a reagent such as benzyl bromide in the presence of base such as potassium carbonate in a solvent such as DMF. This diastereomeric mixture can then be subjected to purification procedures, for example Preparative HPLC or silica gel chromatography. The diastereomerically pure material obtained can then be subjected to deprotection conditions (step 5b). For example, if R═Bn, the material can be treated under hydrogenation conditions using a catalyst such as palladium on carbon in a solvent such as MeOH under a hydrogen atmosphere. Compound (xix) in Scheme 5 may also be prepared from compound (xvii) by a synthetic sequence outlined in Scheme 6. Step 1: The first step of Scheme 6 is accomplished by treating compound (xvii) with a base such as sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)-amide in a solvent such as THF at low temperature such as −78° C. under an inert atmosphere. To the resulting enolate of (xvii) is treated with a reagent such as tert-butyl bromoacetate to provide compound (xxiii). Step 2: Conversion of compound (xxiii) to (xxiv) may be accomplished by treating compound (xxiii) with hydrogen peroxide and lithium hydroxide at an appropriate temperature using a mixture of solvents such as THF/water. Step 3: Compound (xxiv) can be converted to compound (xix) by generating the enolate of (xxiv) with a base such as LDA in a solvent such as THF at low temperature such as −78° C. under an inert atmosphere and further treatment with a reagent (R2-LG) bearing an appropriate leaving group (e.g., LG=triflate). Compound (xix) may then be utilized, for example, in step 1 of Scheme 8. Alternately, the mixture may be subjected to epimerization conditions, for example by treatment with LDA and diethylaluminum chloride followed by quenching with methanol or acetic acid to enrich the desired diastereomer. Moreover, a preferred embodiment entails the installation of a moiety that may later be transformed to another substituent. For example, using a different reactant (R2-LG), such as allyl bromide, installs a suitable grouping for future modifications. Epimerization conditions, as noted above, may also be employed on this compound if desired. Step 4: The fourth step of Scheme 6 is similar to that of step 5 in Scheme 5 and may be omitted if compound (xix) will be used directly in, for example, step 1 of Scheme 8. However, if further manipulation of, for example, R2 of compound (xix) is desired, the carboxylic acid moiety of compound (xix) may be protected with a suitable protecting group, for example a benzyl group. Hence, compound (xix) may be treated with a reactant such as benzyl bromide, in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate in a suitable solvent such as DMF. The resulting mixture of diastereoisomers may be separated if desired, employing suitable conditions such as preparative HPLC, preparative chiral HPLC or silica gel chromatography, and the resulting pure desired diastereoisomer compound (xxii) used in the subsequent steps. Step 1: The first step of Scheme 7 is accomplished by treating Compound (xxv) with a reagent such as sodium nitrite in an acid such as H2SO4 and a solvent such as water to provide Compound (xxvi). Step 2: The acid group of Compound (xxvi) is protected with a protecting group to give Compound (xxvii), a strategy known to one skilled in the art. For example, the reaction may be performed using an alcohol such as benzyl alcohol in a solvent such as toluene and an acid such as H2SO4 to provide Compound (xxvii). Step 3: Compound (xxviii) bearing a suitable leaving group may be prepared by treatment of Compound (xxvii) with a base such as 2,6-Lutidine and a reagent such as trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride in a solvent such as DCM at an appropriate temperature. Step 4: The preparation of Compound (xxx) may be effected by treating Compound (xxix) with a base such as LiHMDS in a solvent such as THF at an appropriate temperature such as −78° C., followed by the addition of a solution of Compound (xxviii) in a solvent such as THF. Step 5: The protecting group of Compound (xxx) may be removed via many methods known to one skilled in the art. For example, a benzyl group may be removed by subjecting it to hydrogenation conditions using a palladium catalyst such as Pearlman's Catalyst in a solvent such as methanol to provide Compound (xxii). Step 1: Benzodiazepinone (x) may be coupled to either pure diastereomer compound (xxii) or diastereomeric mixture compound (xix) in the presence of a coupling reagent such as TBTU and a base such as TEA, in a solvent such as DMF to provide compound (xxxi) as either a diastereomerically pure compound or as a mixture of diastereoisomers, as appropriate. This mixture may be used as such in the subsequent step, or if desired, may be purified using an appropriate separation technique, such as chiral preparative chromatography to provide the diastereomerically pure compounds. Step 2: Treatment of compound (xxxi) with an acid such as TFA at an appropriate temperature such as 25° C., in a solvent such as DCM provides compound (xxxii) as either a diastereomerically pure compound or as a mixture of diastereoisomers. This mixture may be used as such in the subsequent step, or if desired, may be purified using an appropriate separation technique, such as chiral preparative chromatography to provide the diastereomerically pure compounds. Step 3: Conversion of compound (xxxii) to compound (xxxiii) may be accomplished via coupling of compound (xxxii) with an appropriate amine source such as ammonium chloride, a carbodiimide such as EDC, HOBT and a base such as TEA in a solvent such as DMF. If necessary the diastereomeric mixture can be separated using an appropriate separation technique, such as chiral preparative chromatography.

Biological Assays The pharmacological properties of the compounds of this invention may be confirmed by a number of biological assays. The exemplified biological assays, which follow, have been carried out with compounds of the invention. Notch-CBF1 Transactivation Assay The Notch-CBF1 (C-promoter binding factor I) cell based transactivation assay is based on the ability of the released Notch intracellular domain fragments (NICDs) to function as transcription factors in conjunction with CBF1 and other nuclear factors. Luciferase assays were used to measure the antagonism of Notch-CBF1 transcriptional activity. HeLa cervical cancer cells are transiently co-transfected with pCDNA3.1/Hygro plasmids containing truncated Notch 1, Notch 2, Notch 3, or Notch 4 receptors and a PGL3 luciferase reporter vector containing 4 copies of CBF1 binding site. The cells were then tested for Notch-CBF1 activity in the absence or presence of test compounds. HeLa cells, maintained in DMEM (high glucose with HEPES), 1× glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin and 10% Fetal Bovine serum, were transiently transfected in a T175 Flask (4.5×106 cells/flask) using the Monster Transfection Kit (Minis #MIR2906) according to manufacturers specifications. Table 1 denotes respective DNA quantity for the transfections. TABLE 1 DNA (μg) CBF1 (μg) Vector (μg) Total DNA (μg) human Notch 1 6 14.4 15.6 36.0 human Notch 2 2 14.4 19.6 36.0 human Notch 3 0.3 14.4 21.3 36.0 human Notch 4 4 14.4 17.6 36.0 Six hours post-transfection, cells were trypsinized and plated into a 384-well black Poly-D-lysine coated tissue culture plate at a density of 5×103 cells/well in 95 μL assay media (DMEM (high glucose with HEPES), 1× glutamine/penicillin/streptomycin, 0.0125% BSA, 1× non-essential amino acids). Assay media (5 μL) containing test compounds in final concentrations ranging from 5 μM to 8.4×10−5 μM (3 fold serial dilutions) were added to the cells and the cell plates were then incubated for 18 hours at 37° C. and 5% CO2. Control wells contained DMSO vehicle (total counts) or 0.5 μM of an in-house small molecule inhibitor (background counts). Duplicates were used for each sample. Luciferase activity was measured after a 20-minute incubation with 50 μl STEADY-GLO® luciferase reagents according to manufacturer's specifications (Promega, Cat. #E2550) and analyzed by Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer, Boston, Mass.). The antagonist effect of compounds was expressed as 100×[1−(average sample−average background)/(average total−average background)] where sample is the luciferase activity in the presence of test compound, background is equal to the luciferase activity in the presence of the small molecule inhibitor control and the total is signal induced in DMSO wells. Data was plotted using a four parameter logistic fit equation and the IC50 value was defined as the concentration of compound that inhibited 50% of the luciferase activity. Table 2 below lists the Notch 1 and Notch 3 IC50 values for Examples 1-31 of this invention measured in the Notch-CBF1 Transactivation Assay hereinabove. In some instances, the value is an average of multiple experiments where N is the number of experiments conducted. The compounds of the present invention, as exemplified by the Examples 1-31 showed Notch 1 values of 21.9 nM or less and Notch 3 IC50 values of 28.3 nM or less.

Compounds that are not readily metabolized by the liver can be administered at therapeutically effective plasma levels for therapeutically effective periods of time. Orally administered compounds typically are absorbed through the intestinal walls into the blood stream and undergo a first pass through the liver. Compounds that are not readily metabolized in this first pass through the liver can be distributed to other areas of the body in therapeutically effective amounts. The metabolic stability assay evaluated CYP-mediated metabolic stability in vitro using human, rat, mouse, dog, and/or monkey microsomes after a ten-minute incubation. Each compound was tested in duplicate. The results of these assays were expressed as the fraction of parent compound remaining in the reaction mixture after a ten-minute incubation (Percent Remaining) In general, these results were used to evaluate only the extent of CYP-mediated, or NADPH-dependent, metabolism of the test compound. When the compound was significantly metabolized (<40-50% remaining), this indicated high clearance of the compound in vivo due to CYP-mediated metabolism. However, if the compound demonstrated moderate (50-80%) or low (>85%) metabolism in these in vitro assays, high clearance was still possible in vivo via other metabolism and elimination pathways. The percent remaining results of these assays was predictive of compound clearance in vivo, assuming that CYP-mediated metabolism was a predominant elimination pathway. In different microsomal species, the ranges of results were approximately as shown in Table 3. TABLE 3 Metabolic Stability - Result Interpretation Guidelines CYP-Mediated Percent Remaining after 10 minutes Clearance Human Rat Mouse Dog Monkey Low >90 >85 >85 >90 >85 Medium 60-90 40-85 50-85 55-90 40-85 High <60 <40 <50 <55 <40 Methods and Materials Incubation with Liver Microsomes Test compound was received as a 3.5 mM stock solution in 100 percent DMSO. The test compound was diluted to create a 50 μM acetonitrile (ACN) solution containing 1.4% DMSO, which was then used as a 100× stock for incubation with microsomes. Each compound was tested in duplicate separately in each of three species in the Metabolic Stability-Human, Rat, and Mouse assay suite or as individual species in the Metabolic Stability-Dog or Metabolic Stability-Monkey suites. Compound, NADPH, and liver microsome solutions were combined for incubation in three steps: 1. 152 μl of liver microsome suspension, protein concentration of 1.1 mg/ml in 100 mM NaPi, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2 buffer, was pre-warmed at 37° C. 2. 1.7 μl of 50 μM compound (98.6% ACN, 1.4% DMSO) was added to the same tube and pre-incubated at 37° C. for 5 minutes. 3. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 17 μl of pre-warmed 10 mM NADPH solution in 100 mM NaPi, pH 7.4. The reaction components were mixed well, and 75 μl of the reaction mixture was immediately transferred into 150 μl quench/stop solution (zero-time point, T0). Reactions were incubated at 37° C. for 10 minutes and then an additional 75 μl aliquot was transferred into 150 μl quench solution. Acetonitrile containing 100 μM DMN (a UV standard for injection quality control), was used as the quench solution to terminate metabolic reactions. Quenched mixtures were centrifuged at 1500 rpm (˜500×g) in an ALLEGRA® X-12 centrifuge, SX4750 rotor (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, Calif.) for fifteen minutes to pellet denatured microsomes. A volume of 90 μl of supernatant extract, containing the mixture of parent compound and its metabolites, was then transferred to a separate 96-well plate for UV-LC/MS-MS analysis to determine the percent of parent compound that remained in the mixture.

Mass Spectrometer: Thermo TSQ QUANTUM® Ultra triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. Sample Analysis—Structural Integrity Pre-Analysis The Metabolic Stability structural integrity pre-analysis was used to assess the purity of compounds being assayed. Compounds were received in 96-well plates as 57 μl of a 3.5 mM DMSO solution. The 3.5 mM compound DMSO stock solutions were diluted 18-fold with a solution containing equal volumes of acetonitrile, isopropanol, and MilliQ-H2O. The resulting solutions (200 μM) were analyzed for structural integrity by LC-UV/MS on a Thermo LCQ Deca XP Plus ion trap mass spectrometer, using a Waters XBridge C18, 5 μm, 2×50 mm column with a Waters Sentry 2.1 mm guard column, and the LC conditions described in the table below, with a 5 μl injection and a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The acquired data reflected purity by UV absorbance at 220 nm. Only results for those compounds with purity greater than 50% were reported.

Compound solutions at a concentration of 20 μM in 1:1 methanol:water were infused at a flow rate of 90 μL/min, then combined with the mobile phase at a flow rate of 50 μL/min before being introduced into the source. All compounds were optimized first using mobile phase A and B (50% A and 50% B), and if necessary, using mobile phase C and D (also with a 50:50 composition). The optimized parameters, including polarity, SRM transition and collision energy, were stored in a MICROSOFT ACCESS® database. The mass spectrometric conditions obtained from automated infusion were used to analyze incubation samples from the Metabolic Stability assay. The injection volume was 5 μl and the flow rate was 0.8 ml/min. The gradient used was shown in the table below. All samples were injected with the gradient using mobile phase A and B first. If necessary (for instance, for chromatographic reasons), samples were re-injected with the same gradient, but using mobile phase C and D. All LC-MS/MS analysis parameters were captured electronically in the raw data files.

The percent remaining calculation was performed by comparing the LC-MS/MS peak areas from the T10minute samples to those from the T0minute samples for each compound. Quality Control A set of three compounds was tested along with the test compound in each assay plate. Data was accepted and uploaded only if the results for these control compounds fall into the expected ranges shown below.

These parameters were useful for predicting in vivo human clearance, which defines the level of drug exposure in vivo (Obach et al., 1997, 1999). The metabolic stability half-life assay panel evaluates the time-course and the rate of CYP-mediated (NADPH-dependent) metabolism in vitro in human, rat, mouse, dog and monkey microsomes. The time course spans a 45 minute incubation, and includes 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 minute time-points, at each of which the amount of test compound remaining in the mixture was measured. Result Interpretation Guideline The results of the metabolic stability half-life assay are expressed as a half-life (T1/2, min). In general, these results should be used to evaluate only the extent of CYP-mediated, or NADPH-dependent, metabolism of the test compound. When the compound was significantly metabolized (T1/2<14 minutes), this indicated high clearance in vivo due to CYP-mediated metabolism. However, if the compound demonstrated moderate (14-70 minutes) or low (>70 minutes) metabolism in these in vitro assays, high clearance was still possible in vivo via other metabolism and elimination pathways. The results of these assays were predictive of compound clearance in vivo, assuming that CYP-mediated metabolism was a predominant elimination pathway. In human microsomes, the ranges of results were approximately as shown in the following table. TABLE 8 Metabolic Stability Half-Life-Result Interpretation Guidelines T1/2, minutes CYP-Mediated Clearance Human Low >70 Medium 14-70 High <14 Methods and Materials Liver microsomes were purchased from BD-Biosciences (Woburn, Mass.) and NADPH from AppliChem Inc; all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Incubation with Liver Microsomes Test compound was received as a 3.5 mM stock solution in 100 percent DMSO. The test compound was diluted to create a 50 μM acetonitrile (ACN) solution containing 1.4% DMSO, which was then used as a 100-fold stock for incubation with microsomes. Each compound was tested in human, rat, mouse, dog and monkey liver microsomes. Compound, NADPH and liver microsome solutions were combined for incubation in three steps: 1. 450 μl of liver microsome suspension, protein concentration of 1.1 mg/ml in 100 mM NaPi, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl2 buffer, was pre-warmed at 37° C. 2. 5 μl of 50 μM compound (98.6% ACN, 1.4% DMSO) was added to the same tube and pre-incubated at 37° C. for 5 minutes. 3. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μl of pre-warmed 10 mM NADPH solution in 100 mM NaPi, pH 7.4. Reaction components were mixed well, and 65 μl were immediately transferred into 130 μl quench/stop solution (zero-time point, T0). Reactions were incubated at 37° C. for 5, 10, 15, 30 and 45 minutes and at each time-point a 65 μl aliquot was transferred into 130 μl of quench solution. Acetonitrile containing Internal Standard (100 ng/ml), was used as the quench solution to terminate metabolic reactions. Quenched mixtures were centrifuged at 1500 rpm (˜500×g) in an ALLEGRA® X-12 centrifuge, SX4750 rotor (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, Calif.) for fifteen minutes to pellet denatured microsomes. A volume of 90 μl of supernatant extract, containing the mixture of parent compound and its metabolites, was then transferred to a separate 96-well plate for LC/MS-MS analysis to determine the percent of parent compound that was remaining in the mixture.

Human Tumor Xenograft Models in Mice All rodents were obtained from Harlan Sprague Dawley Co. (Indianapolis, Ind.), and maintained in an ammonia-free environment in a defined and pathogen—free colony. All mice were quarantined approximately 1 week prior to their use for tumor propagation and drug efficacy testing. Mice were fed food and water ad libitum. The animal care program of Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute is fully accredited by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). All experiments were performed in accordance with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) animal test methods and guidelines. Tumor xenografts were grown and maintained subcutaneously (SC) in immunocompromized balb/c nu/nu nude or NOD-SCID mice (Harlan Sprague Dawley). Tumors were propagated as subcutaneous transplants in the appropriate mouse strain (Table 10) using tumor fragments obtained from donor mice. TABLE 10 Histological Types and Host Mouse Strain/Gender Requirement for the Propagation of Various Human Tumor Xenografts in Mice Tumor Type Histology Mouse Strain Sex TALL-1 ALL NOD-SCID female HPB-ALL ALL NOD-SCID female ALL-SIL ALL NOD-SCID female MDA-MB-157 breast NOD-SCID female MDA-MB-468 breast NOD-SCID female PAT-34 ovarian nude female PAT-50 ovarian nude female PAT-26 pancreas nude female PAT-27 pancreas nude female Preclinical Chemotherapy Trials The required numbers of animals needed to detect a meaningful response were pooled at the start of the experiment and each was given a subcutaneous implant of a tumor fragment (˜20 mg) with a 13-gauge trocar. Tumors were allowed to grow to the pre-determined size window (tumors outside the range were excluded) and animals were evenly distributed to various treatment and control groups. There were typically 8 mice per treatment and control groups, with the exception of experiments conducted in the SAL-IGF (this is not included in Table 10) tumor model, in which there were typically 5 mice per treatment and control group. Treatment of each animal was based on individual body weight. Treated animals were checked daily for treatment related toxicity/mortality. Each group of animals was weighed before the initiation of treatment (Wt1) and then again following the last treatment dose (Wt2). The difference in body weight (Wt2−Wt1) provides a measure of treatment-related toxicity. Tumor response was determined by measurement of tumors with a caliper twice a week, until the tumors reached a predetermined “target” size of 0.5 gm or 1 gm depending on the tumor type. Tumor weights (mg) were estimated from the formula: [in-line-formulae]Tumor weight=(length×width2)÷2[/in-line-formulae] Tumor response criteria are expressed in terms of tumor growth inhibition (% TGI). Tumor growth delay is defined as the difference in time (days) required for the treated tumors (T) to reach a predetermined target size compared to those of the control group (C). For this purpose, the tumor weight of a group is expressed as medium tumor weight (MTW). Tumor growth inhibition is calculated as follows: %   Tumor   Growth   Inhibition = ( 1 - T t T 0 * C 0 C t ) ( 1 - C 0 C t ) where, Ct=Median control tumor size at end of treatment C0=Median control tumor size at treatment initiation Tt=Median tumor size of treated group at end of treatment T0=Median tumor size of treated group at treatment initiation Activity is defined as the achievement of durable tumor growth inhibition of 50% or greater (i.e., TGI≧50%) or log cell kill of 0.5 or greater (LCK≧0.5) for a period equivalent to at least 1 tumor volume doubling time and drug treatment must be for a period equivalent to at least 2 tumor volume doubling time. Tumor response was also expressed in terms of tumor growth delay (TGD value), defined as the difference in time (days) required for the treated tumors (T) to reach a predetermined target size compared to those of the control group (C). Whenever possible, antitumor activity was determined at a range of dose levels up to the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which is defined as the dose level immediately below which excessive toxicity (i.e., more than one death) occurred. When death occurred, the day of death was recorded. Treated mice dying prior to having their tumors reach target size were considered to have died from drug toxicity. No control mice died bearing tumors less than target size. Treatment groups with more than one death caused by drug toxicity were considered to have had excessively toxic treatments and their data were not included in the evaluation of a compound's antitumor efficacy. Potential drug toxicity interaction affecting treatment tolerability is an important consideration in combination chemotherapy trials. Interpretation of combination therapeutic results must be based on comparison of antitumor activity of the best possible response for the single agents versus the combination at comparably tolerated doses. Therefore, therapeutic synergism was defined as a therapeutic effect achieved with a tolerated regimen of the combined agents that exceeded the optimal effect achieved at any tolerated dose of monotherapy. Statistical evaluations of data were performed using Gehan's generalized Wilcoxon test. Statistical significance was declared at P<0.05. Drug Administration In in vitro studies, all agents were dissolved in 100% DMSO and serially diluted in media/10% fetal bovine serum. For administration of Notch inhibitors to rodents, the following excipients were used: ETOH/TPGS/PEG300 (10:10:80). Notch inhibitors were typically administered orally on a schedule of QD×15, 10 day-on-2 day-off, although other schedules had also been evaluated and shown to be efficacious. For example, dosing regimen consisting of QD×12, 4 day-on-3 day-off was shown to be equally efficacious as QD×15, 10 day-on-2 day-off. In Vivo Antitumor Activity The antitumor activity of Example 1 administered via the intravenous route (IV) was evaluated in human tumor xenografts implanted in mice. As shown in FIG. 6, Example 1 exhibited antitumor activity. Table 11 below lists the antitumor activity of examples of this invention measured in the Human Tumor Xenograft Models in mice. The compounds of the present invention, as exemplified by Examples 1 and 2, showed antitumor activity with oral administration (PO).
