(E)-methyl 3-(4-((6S,8R/6R,8S)-3-acetyl-7-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8, 9-tetrahydro- 3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate
(E)-methyl 3-(4-((1S,3R/1R,3S)-6-acetamido-2-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-1-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 70j (10 mg, 0.02 mmol) was dissolved in 1.5 mL of ethyl acetate, then acetic anhydride (6 mg, 0.06 mmol), tetrabutylammonium bromide (0.6 mg, 0.002 mmol), potassium acetate (5 mg, 0.05 mmol) and 3-methyl-1-nitrobutane (5 mg, 0.04 mmol) were added. After stirring for 48 hours, the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by CombiFlash flash preparation instrument with elution system B to obtain the title compound (E)-methyl 3-(4-((6S,8R/6R,8S)-3-acetyl-7-(2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro -3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-3,5-difluorophenyl)acrylate 70k (7 mg, yield 70%) as a yellow solid.
