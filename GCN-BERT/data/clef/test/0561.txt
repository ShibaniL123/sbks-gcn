Step 1-4, preparation of {1-[6-bromo-7-chloro-3-(3-fluoro-5-methyl-phenyl)-cinnolin-4-yl]-piperidin-4-yl}-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester: 6-Bromo-4,7-dichloro-3-(3-fluoro-5-methyl-phenyl)-cinnoline (0.38 g, 0.98 mmol), piperidin-4-yl-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (320 mg, 1.6 mmol), triethylamine (0.66 mL, 4.9 mmol), and IPA (6 mL) was filled into a seal tube, and the mixture was stirred for 20 h at 130° C. The reaction was cooled to room temperature, diluted with EtOAc, washed with 1N-HCl (2×), dried, and concentrated. The residue was purified by column chromatography to afford the title compound (0.21 g, 39%). MS (M+H)−=549.6.
