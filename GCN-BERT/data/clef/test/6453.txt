TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a method of preparing a biodegradable polyester-based polymer by using a carbodiimide compound, and a polymer prepared by the same. BACKGROUND ART Polyester is a heat-resisting, highly elastic strength synthetic resin with excellent chemical resistance, and is used for reinforced plastics. For example, polyester is widely used for car bodies, bodies of motor boat, and furniture, and also as a fiber material for clothes. Particularly, due to the environmental problems caused by waste plastics, studies have been actively conducted on biodegradable polymers which can completely be completely decomposed. A biodegradable polyester-based polymers are polymers that may decompose to water and carbon dioxide, or water and methane gas by microorganisms existing in the nature such as bacteria, algae, and fungi. Biodegradable polyester-based polymers can be produced by a condensation reaction of, for example, diol and diacid. There are various kinds of polyester-based polymers including aliphatic polyester-based copolymers and aromatic polyester-based copolymers as examples of the biodegradable polyester-based polymers. A biodegradable polyester-based polymer may have a drawback in that the physical properties of a final product can be decreased as ester bonds are hydrolyzed due to atmospheric moisture and a highly humid environment. Particularly, as a film used for packaging and a shopping bag material made of a biodegradable polyester-based polymer are thin, they are easily hydrolyzed within 2 to 3 months when exposed to a high temperature and high humidity environment. Therefore, there is a need for developing a biodegradable polyester-based polymer having a low hydrolysis tendency. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTIVE CONCEPT TECHNICAL PROBLEM An Example of the present invention provides a method of preparing a biodegradable polyester-based polymer by using a carbodiimide compound.

ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS A method of preparing a biodegradable polyester-based polymer according to an Example of the present invention provides a biodegradable polyester-based polymer having a lower hydrolysis tendency and lower acid value than a conventional polyester-based polymer. BEST MODE The following is a detailed description of a method of preparing a biodegradable polyester-based polymer according to an Example of the present invention and a biodegradable polyester-based polymer prepared by the method. In the present description, a "carbodiimide-containing compound" refers to a compound containing a "-N=C=N-" functional group. In the present description, a "dicarboxylic acid compound" refers to a compound containing two carboxyl groups. In the present description, "derivatives of a dicarboxylic acid compound" refer to compounds including all derivatives of a dicarboxylic acid compound such as an ester derivative, an acyl halide derivative, and an anhydride derivative thereof. In the present description, a "diol compound" refers to a compound containing two hydroxyl groups. In the present description, a "tricarboxylic acid compound" refers to a compound containing three carboxyl groups. In the present description, "derivatives of a tricarboxylic acid compound" refer to compounds including all derivatives of a tricarboxylic acid compound such as an ester derivative, an acyl halide derivative, and an anhydride derivative thereof. In the present description, an "extent of reaction" refers to a ratio of an actual polymer yield to a theoretical polymer yield. An "extent of reaction" can be obtained, for example, in case of performing a condensation polymerization of a dicaboxylic acid compound and a diol compound, by measuring a ratio of the actual produced moisture content to the theoretical moisture content which can be produced when the dicaboxylic acid compound and the diol compound are reacted to attain a reaction yield of 100%. According to an aspect of the present invention, a method of preparing a biodegradable polyester-based polymer includes a prepolymerization step of polymerizing a dicarboxylic acid compound (A), a diol compound (B), and a carbodiimide compound (C), which is represented by Formula (1) below, at 160-220°C to produce a prepolymer ; and a condensation polymerization step of performing a condensation polymerization of the prepolymer at 200-250°C, under a vacuum pressure of 0.1 to 2 Torr: In Formula 1, X is selected from the group consisting of a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted C1-C20 alkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C1-C20 alkoxy group, a substituted or unsubstituted C2-C20 alkenyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C2-C20 alkynyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C1-C20 heteroalkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C6-C30 aryl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C7-C30 arylalkyl group, a substituted or unsubstituted C5-C30 heteroaryl group, and a substituted or unsubstituted C3-C30 heteroarylakyl group. When a polymerization temperature in the prepolymerization step is lower than 160°C, the reactivity of monomers is low, so that the reaction time may increase. When a polymerization temperature in the prepolymerization step is higher than 220°C, a thermal decomposition of the prepolymer may occur. When a polymerization temperature of the condensation polymerization step is lower than 200 °C, the reactivity of the prepolymer is low, so that the reaction time may increase. When a polymerization temperature of the condensation polymerization step is higher than 250 °C, a thermal decomposition of a produced polymer may occur. When a polymerization pressure of the condensation polymerization step is higher than 2 Torr, the unreacted diol compound that are excessively used and other monomers are hard to be eliminated, so that the condensation polymerization time may increase. In addition, the condensation polymerization pressure in the condensation polymerization step is in reality difficult to be lowered below 0.1 Torr. Specifically, the condensation polymerization pressure in the condensation polymerization may be 0.5 to 1 Torr. The carbodiimide compound (C) can increase a hydrolysis-resistance of the polymer by decreasing an acid value of the polymer, which is a final product. Specifically, the carbodiimide compound (C) plays the role of reducing the amount of an acid group (e.g. -OH, -COOH, etc.) existing as an end group of a polymer by participating in polymerization reaction in the prepolymerization step and/or the condensation polymerization step. The amount of the carbodiimide compound (C) used may be less than 0.1-1 wt%, e.g., 0.1-0.5 wt% with respect to the total weight of the composition consisting of the dicarboxylic acid compound (A), the diol compound (B), and the carbodiimide compound (C). If the amount of the carbodiimide compound (C) used is within the range (0.1 to 1 wt%), a polymer having a high molecular weight and a low acid value can be obtained. The ratio of the amount of the dicarboxylic acid compound (A) used to the amount of the diol compound (B) used may be 1:1 to 1:4, based on the molar ratio. If the molar ratio of the amount of the dicarboxylic acid compound (A) used to the amount of the diol compound (B) used is within the range (1:1 to 1:4), the extent of reaction of monomers may be increased. For example, the amount of the diol compound (B) may be excessive in comparison with the amount of the dicarboxylic acid compound (A). Specifically, the amount of the diol compound (B) used may be 1.0 to 1.3 times, e.g., 1.04-1.07 times greater than the amount of dicarboxylic acid compound (A) used, in terms of chemical equivalent. The prepolymerization step may be performed for 130 to 150 minutes. An end point of the prepolymerization step may be determined by measuring the amount of alcohol or water, which is a byproduct of the step. For example, when 1 mol of dimethyl terephthalate, as a dicarboxylic acid compound (A), and 1.3 mol of 1,4-butanediol, as a diol compound (B), are used, if it is assumed that all amount of the used dimethyl terephthalate has reacted with the butanediol, the prepolymerization step may be ended after more than 95% (that is, 1.9 mol) of 2 mol methanol, which is supposed to be produced, is generated as a byproduct. In order to increase a reaction rate by moving a chemical equilibrium in the prepolymerization step, alcohol, water, which are byproducts, and/or an unreacted diol compound may be discharged out of the reaction system by evaporation or distillation. The condensation polymerization step may be performed for 120 to 150 minutes. X may be each independently a substituted or unsubstituted C6-C15 aryl group.
