The present invention relates to an inorganic phosphor and its use in lighting applications, particularly in phosphor converted light emitting diode lighting devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to a phosphor, comprising an inorganic luminescent compound represented by formula (1) having an emission spectrum resolvable into a first Gaussian emission curve and a second Gaussian emission curve; wherein the first Gaussian emission curve has a first Gaussian emission curve peak, P1; wherein the first Gaussian emission curve peak, P1, has a peak 1 height, HP1, a peak 1 peak wavelength, PλP1, and a peak 1 area, AP1; wherein the second Gaussian emission curve has a second Gaussian emission curve peak, P2; wherein the second Gaussian emission curve peak, P2, has a peak 2 height, HP2, a peak 2 peak wavelength, PλP2, a peak 2 full width at half max, FWHMP2, and a peak 2 area, AP2; wherein PλP1<PλP2; and, wherein, at least one of, (a) the peak 2 height, HP2, is minimized; (b) the peak 2 full width at half max, FWHMP2, is minimized; and, (c) the peak 2 area, AP2, is minimized; and, lighting devices comprising the same. Phosphor-converted LEDs (pcLEDs) utilize a blue LED chip as a light source and one or more phosphors to produce white light. Devices based on pcLED technology are poised to become fundamental devices for general use in solid state lighting applications. Nevertheless, significant advances are required in order to achieve the performance specifications set by the solid state lighting market. The pcLED devices create their white light emissions from a single LED by exciting the included phosphor(s) using the emission spectrum produced by the blue LED chip. The emission spectrum produced by the blue LED chip excites the included phosphor(s) which then produce an emission spectrum that combines with that of the blue LED chip to yield white light. It is important to recognize that color tuning of the blue LED chip and the included phosphor(s) is critical for the effectiveness and optimization of the pcLED devices. Accordingly, there is a continuing need for phosphor development to provide pcLED device manufactures with enhanced color tuning capabilities. Also, the phosphors used in conventional pcLED device designs are located in close proximity to the blue LED light source. As a result, during light generation these phosphors are subjected to elevated temperatures. The junction temperatures exhibited by high power LED chips are typically in the range of 100 to 150° C. At such elevated temperatures, the crystal of the phosphors are at a high vibrationally excited state. When placed in such a high vibrationally excited state, the excitation energy can result in the generation of additional heat through non-luminescent relaxation rather than resulting in the desired luminescence emission from the phosphor. This heat generation exacerbates the situation resulting in a vicious cycle that contributes to the inability of current pcLED devices to achieve the industry established performance specifications for the solid state lighting market. Accordingly, successful development of pcLED devices for general illumination requires the identification of phosphors that can operate highly efficiently at temperatures of 100 to 150° C. Nitride based phosphors have been proposed for use in pcLED devices because of their excellent luminescence performance at the high temperatures developed in pcLED devices. Examples of such nitride based phosphors include metal silicon nitride based phosphors. The host crystals of these phosphor materials consist mainly of chemical bonds of Si—N, Al—N, as well as hybrid bonds thereof, as the backbone of the structure. While these bonds are stable, the chemical bond between silicon and carbon (Si—C) has a higher bond energy, and therefore higher thermal and chemical stability. Furthermore, carbon forms very stable chemical bonds with many metal atoms. Carbidonitride phosphors can be comprised of carbon, silicon, germanium, nitrogen, aluminum, boron and other metals in the host crystal and one or more metal dopants as a luminescent activator. This class of phosphors has recently emerged as a color converter capable of converting near UV (nUV) or blue light to other light in the visible spectral range, e.g., blue, green, yellow, orange and red light. The host crystal of carbidonitride phosphors is comprised of —N—Si—C—, —N—Si—N—, and —C—Si—C— networks in which the strong covalent bonds of Si—C and Si—N serve as the main building blocks of the structure. In certain carbidonitride phosphors, the carbon can enhance, rather than quench, the luminescence of the phosphor, in particular when the phosphor is subjected to relatively high temperatures (e.g. 200° C. to 400° C.). The reflectance of certain silicon carbidonitride phosphors in the wavelength range of the desired emission spectrum increases as the amount of carbon increases. These carbidonitride phosphors have been reported to exhibit excellent thermal stability of emission and high emission efficiency. One family of carbidonitride based phosphors designed for use in pcLED devices is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 8,535,566 to Li et al.

It is known that each Eu2+ cation incorporated into an inorganic substance generically represented by formula (1) can occupy either a substitutional or interstitial position within the host lattice. For example, the Eu2+ cations incorporated into the inorganic substance generically represented by formula (1) can substitute into the host lattice sites otherwise occupied by a M(II) divalent cation (i.e., Mg2+, Ca2+, Sr2+ or Ba2+). Such site specific substitution is a result of the Eu2+ cation having the same oxidation state as the displaced M(II) divalent cation as well as the Eu2+ cation having a similar ionic radii (6-coordinate Sr2+, 1.18 Å; 6-coordinate Eu2+, 1.17 Å). The designers of pcLED devices are acutely aware of how the human eye responds to the electromagnetic spectrum and how that response translates into the performance and efficiency of the incorporating pcLED devices. That is, the designers of pcLED devices will recognize that the human eye will not be sensitive to emission spectrum emitted from the device that falls outside the area beneath the photopic response curve. Accordingly, these designers will recognize the desirability of phosphors for use in pcLED devices that provide as much emission spectrum under the photopic response curve as possible while still providing suitable color coordinates CIEX and CIEY based on the CIE 1931 Chromaticity Diagram for a given device design. It has surprisingly been found that conventional substances generically represented by formula (1) exhibit an emission spectrum, ES455, upon excitation with monochromatic light having a wavelength of 455 nm; wherein the emission spectrum, ES455, is resolvable into a first Gaussian emission curve and a second Gaussian emission curve; wherein the first Gaussian emission curve has a first Gaussian emission curve peak, P1; wherein the first Gaussian emission curve peak, P1, has a peak 1 height, HP1, a peak 1 peak wavelength, PλP1, and a peak 1 area, AP1; wherein the second Gaussian emission curve has a second Gaussian emission curve peak, P2; wherein the second Gaussian emission curve peak, P2, has a peak 2 height, HP2, a peak 2 peak wavelength, PλP2, a peak 2 area, AP2, and a peak 2 full width half max, FWHMP2; wherein PλP1<PλP2. It is believed that the first Gaussian emission curve and the second Gaussian emission curve correspond to different positions occupied by the Eu2+ in the conventional substances generically represented by formula (1). In view of this realization, it becomes apparent that the modification of these substances to provide, at least one of, a minimized peak 2 height, HP2; a minimized peak 2 full width at half max, FWHMP2; and a minimized peak 2 area, AP2, can result in a significant increase in the brightness of the light emitted from the modified substances upon excitation with monochromatic light having a wavelength of 455 nm by maximizing the emission in the region visible to the human eye. Conventional inorganic substances generically represented by formula (1) are prepared by firing of the constituent raw material powder in a crucible, wherein the internal surfaces of the crucible coming into contact with the raw material powder have previously been seasoned through repeated exposure to a silicon source at high temperatures. Also, conventional substances generically represented by formula (1) exhibit an emission spectrum, ES455, upon excitation with monochromatic light having a wavelength of 455 nm; wherein the emission spectrum, ES455, is resolvable into a first Gaussian emission curve and a second Gaussian emission curve; wherein the first Gaussian emission curve has a first Gaussian emission curve peak, P1; wherein the first Gaussian emission curve peak, P1, has a peak 1 height, HP1, a peak 1 peak wavelength, PλP1, and a peak 1 area, AP1; wherein the second Gaussian emission curve has a second Gaussian emission curve peak, P2; wherein the second Gaussian emission curve peak, P2, has a peak 2 height, HP2, a peak 2 peak wavelength, PλP2, a peak 2 area, AP2, and a peak 2 full width half max, FWHMP2; wherein PλP1<PλP2; and, wherein the peak ratio, PR, as determined by the following equation [in-line-formulae]PR=HP1/HP2 [/in-line-formulae] is <1. It has surprisingly been found that phosphors represented by formula (1) when prepared by firing of the constituent raw material powder in a crucible, wherein the surfaces of the crucible coming into contact with the raw material powder are composed of a virgin metal surface (i.e., a surface that has not been seasoned through repeated exposure to a silicon source at high temperatures) exhibit an overall emission band narrowing with a significant increase in brightness. It is believed that the increase in brightness is due, at least in part, to a structural modification of the phosphor through manipulation of the location and bonding environment of the Eu2+ in the crystal structure of the phosphor of the present invention evinced by, at least one of, (i) a reduction in the peak 2 height, HP2, relative to the peak 1 height, HP1; wherein the peak ratio, PR, is ≧1; (ii) a reduction in the peak 2 full width half max, FWHMP2; wherein the FWHMP2<100 nm; and, (iii) a reduction in the peak 2 area, AP2, relative to the peak 1 area, AP1; wherein the area ratio, AR, is ≧0.6.
