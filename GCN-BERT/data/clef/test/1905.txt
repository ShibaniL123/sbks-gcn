BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention idea relates to an amine-based hydrophobe useful in preparing hydrophobically modified alkylene oxide urethane polymers, which are useful as rheology modifiers for coatings formulations. Rheology modifiers are typically designed to impart desirable rheological properties to coating formulations over a wide shear rate range. U.S. Pat. No. 7,741,402 discloses ethylene oxide urethane polymers modified with hydrophobes that contain organic bases such as secondary or tertiary amines (amine-modified HEURs), the presence of which provides for viscosity control through a pH trigger. When the pH of the HEUR composition is sufficiently low with respect to the pKa of the incorporated base, the basic groups are protonated and the viscosity is relatively low; when the pH is sufficiently high, associative thickening occurs. Thus, incorporation of basic hydrophobes into the HEUR polymer allows relatively high concentration of polymer to be dissolved in water at low pH; once the solution is added to the high pH environment of paint coatings, the base is deprotonated and the associative thickening mechanism activated. Amine-modified HEURs can be sensitive to the pH of the paint formulation to which it is added. For example, the pH of the formulation, through time and heat aging, may decrease to a level below a critical pH conducive to associative thickening, thereby resulting in a poorer formulation; consequently, it would be desirable to discover a hydrophobe, more particularly an amine-based hydrophobe, that preserves the desired viscosity of the formulation in face of pH-lowering mechanisms. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention addresses a need by providing, in one aspect, a compound characterized by the following formula: where R1 is C1-C16-alkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, C1-C16-alkylphenyl, C1-C16-alkylnaphthyl, or —CH2—OR4, where R4 is C1-C12-alkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, C1-C12-alkylphenyl, or C1-C12-alkylnaphthyl; each R2 is independently C1-C6-alkyl; each Y is independently C3-C8-alkylene or CH2CHR3, where each R3 is independently H, C1-C12-alkyl, phenyl, naphthyl, C1-C12-alkylphenyl, or C1-C12-alkylnaphthyl; m is 0, 1 or 2; and p is from 1 to 50.

Examples of suitable diisocyanates include 1,4-tetramethylene diisocyanate, 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate, 2,2,4-trimethyl-1,6-diisocyanatohexane, 1,10-decamethylene diisocyanate, 4,4′-methylenebis(isocyanatocyclohexane), 1,4-cyclohexylene diisocyanate, 1-isocyanato-3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexane, m- and p-phenylene diisocyanate, 2,6- and 2,4-toluene diisocyanate, xylene diisocyanate, 4-chloro-1,3-phenylene diisocyanate, 4,4′-biphenylene diisocyanate, 4,4′-methylene diphenylisocyanate, 1,5-naphthylene diisocyanate, and 1,5-tetrahydronaphthylene diisocyanate. A water-soluble polyalkylene glycol refers to water-soluble polyethylene oxides, water-soluble polyethylene oxide/polypropylene oxide copolymers, and water-soluble polyethylene oxide/polybutylene oxide copolymers. As used herein, the term propylene oxide refers to either a polymer having —(OCH2CH2CH2)— and/or —(OCH(CH3)CH2)— repeating groups.

An example of a suitable polyethylene glycol is PEG 8000, which is commercially available as CARBOWAX™ 8000 Polyethylene Glycol (a trademark of The Dow Chemical Company (“Dow”) or an affiliate of Dow, Midland, Mich.). The water soluble polyalkylene oxides may, alternatively, be linked with polyfunctional groups other than polyisocyanates to form non-urethane compositions that can benefit by tertiary amine-modification as described herein. Examples of suitable alternative linker groups include epihalohydrins, gem dihalides, and aminoplasts.

Such polymer-encapsulated opacifying pigment particles are described, for example, in U.S. Patent Publication US 2010/0298483 A1. In another example, the coating composition may include polymer-encapsulated opacifying pigment particles as described in WO 2007/112503A1.

Heat Age Stability Studies Heat age stabilities of thickened paints were evaluated in a satin white formulation having a pigment volume concentration of 40.5% and a total solids concentration of 38.0% by volume. The formulation contained 30.3 weight % of wet ROVACE™ 661 Vinyl Acrylic Binder (A Trademark of The Dow Chemical Company or its Affiliates) based on the weight of wet paint formulation, as well as 4.1 weight % of wet RHOPLEX™ SG-10M Acrylic Copolymer (A Trademark of The Dow Chemical Company or its Affiliates) based on weight of wet paint formulation. Paints comprising poly(vinyl acetate) binders with an initial pH of about 9 are known to decrease in pH upon aging because of hydrolysis of the acetate group. An initial paint pH of about 9 can facilitate colloidal and biocide stability of the paint. Paint pH typically decreases to about pH=7 upon aging whereupon the rate of hydrolysis slows dramatically. Heat aging is typically employed in lab studies to accelerate the effects of paint aging. A large viscosity drop upon aging is undesirable. Table 1 shows the results of heat age stability studies.

The concentration is expressed as the weight percent of dry active thickener per wet weight of final paint. Example 1-3 thickeners and the Comparative Example thickeners were added as 16 weight % active thickener dispersions in water. These aqueous thickener dispersions also contained 3% wet weight of lactic acid, as supplied. The lactic acid was supplied at 85% solids. The thickener dispersions were made by combining the dry thickener solid, water and lactic acid in a sealed plastic 50-mL centrifuge tube, and slowly rotating the mixture for two days to fully homogenize the thickener solid. pH1 is the initial pH of the paint measured one hour after each paint was formulated. Ammonia was used to adjust the pH to the value shown. Stormer1 is the initial Stormer viscosity, in Krebs Units, of the paints measured at 25° C. in ½-pint metal cans. Stormer1 was measured 24 h after paint formulation. The paint was maintained at 25° C. during this equilibration time. Just prior to measuring the Stormer viscosity, the paints were poured into a ½-pint metal can and stirred with a tongue depressor for 20 s. The Krebs viscometer is a rotating paddle viscometer that is compliant with ASTM-D562. KU viscosity was measured on a Brookfield Krebs Unit Viscometer KU-1+ available from Brookfield Engineering Labs (Middleboro, Mass., USA). pH2 is the paint pH after the paints were stored for 2 weeks in a 60° C. oven. The paints were stored in sealed metal cans during the heat aging process. Stormer2 is the final Stormer viscosity, in Krebs Units, of the heat aged paints measured at 25° C. in ½-pint metal cans. Just prior to measuring the Stormer viscosity, the paints were stirred vigorously with a tongue depressor for 20 s. Δ Stormer, in Krebs Units, is equal to Stormer2 minus Stormer1. A value of A Stormer that is closer to zero is desirable. SCT-275 refers to ACRYSOL™ SCT-275 Rheology Modifier (A Trademark of The Dow Chemical Company), which is a non-acid suppressible polyurethane associative thickener commercially available from The Dow Chemical Company. The as-is viscosity of the product is suppressed by the use of a butyl carbitol-water co-solvent mixture. Paints thickened with thickeners of Examples 1-3 exhibit a much less viscosity drop upon aging than paints thickened with the Comparative Examples. The viscosity drops upon aging exhibited by paints thickened with Examples 1-3 are similar to or better than the viscosity drop of the paint thickened with the commercial rheology modifier, which, unlike the thickeners of the invention, contributes VOC to the paint. 1.
