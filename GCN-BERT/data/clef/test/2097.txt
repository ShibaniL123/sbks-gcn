Step C: N-[(1R)-1-(3-Methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)ethyl(4-methylphenyl)-3-(prop-1-en-2-yl)-1H-indazole-6-carboxamide
3-Bromo-N-[(1R)-1-(3-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)ethyl]-1-(4-methylphenyl)-1H-indazole-6-carboxamide (155.2 mg, 0.352 mmol), 2-isopropenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2- dioxaborolane (99 µl, 0.529 mmol), diisopropylamine (99 µl, 0.705 mmol), triphenylphosphine-3,3',3"-trisulfonic acid trisodium salt hydrate (24.3 mg, 0.038 mmol), and palladium(II) acetate (4.2 mg, 0.019 mmol) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (1300 µl)/water (400 µl), placed in a sealed tube and heated to 100 °C for 1.5 h. The reaction was stopped, cooled to room temperature, quenched by addition of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (10 mL), and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 x 10 mL). The combined organic phases were washed with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (2 x 10 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium chloride(1 x 10 mL), dried (sodium sulfate), filtered, and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography (RediSep SiO2, 24 g column) on a CombiFlash purification system eluting with ethyl acetate-hexanes (0-60%). The title compound (102.8 mg, 0.256 mmol, 72.6 % yield) was recovered as a light yellow/white solid.
