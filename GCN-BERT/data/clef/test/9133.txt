Comparative Example 7: Synthesis of racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.monomaleate
2-propanol solution (17.76 g) containing maleic acid (2.76 g: 23.8 mmol) was charged into a 50 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and 2-propanol solution (11.99 g) containing racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine (2.99 g: 23.7 mmol) was added thereto while stirring at room temperature. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60° C., to obtain racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.monomaleate (4.97 g: 13.9 mmol, yield=63%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 135° C., 186° C.
