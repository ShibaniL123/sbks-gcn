DESCRIPTION The description set forth below in connection with the appended drawings is intended as a description of various embodiments of the disclosed subject matter and is not intended to represent the only embodiments in which the disclosed subject matter may be practiced. The description includes specific details for the purpose of providing a thorough understanding of the disclosed subject matter. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the disclosed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known structures and components may be shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the concepts of the disclosed subject matter. Generally speaking, embodiments of the present invention relate to fastening or closure devices and systems and methods thereof. In particular, embodiments of the present invention can include a fastening device or a plurality of fastening devices. In embodiments, each fastening device may have a body (e.g., a one-piece or unitary body) with opposing ends that are configured and operative to be coupled together or to be coupled to their respective complement in another of said fastening devices. In alternative embodiments, the ends may not be configured and operative to be coupled together. Systems according to embodiments of the disclosed invention can be comprised of a plurality of fastening devices of same or differing configurations and/or one or more ornamental pieces. See, for example, FIG. 27. Incidentally, in embodiments, a portion or portions of the device may be separable or removable from the body, for instance, for replacement thereof. Fastening devices according to embodiments of the present invention may be used as fasteners or closures for items configured for lacing, for instance, including apparel, footwear, bags, luggage, backpacks, purses, boxing gloves, punching bags, shoulder pads, or the like. Fastening devices and systems according to embodiments of the present invention can be used to replace completely or partially the use of laces for particular items. Devices according to embodiments of the present invention also may have ends thereof fastened together to form a piece of jewelry, such as a bracelet, belt, necklace, or the like, or to simply make a relatively longer fastening device wherein free ends of the furthest apart devices in end-to-end configuration are coupled together. Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention may provide a means by which to fasten, close, or secure an article of footwear for user wear to thereby replace completely or partially laces. Such partial or full replacement of laces can provide a safer means by which to fasten or otherwise close the footwear when worn by a user. Embodiments of the present invention also may allow a user to customize and decorate the look and layout of his or her footwear or other article/item as set forth herein. Referring now to FIGS. 1 -7, which show an embodiment of a fastening or closure device 100 according to the present invention, the device 100 can have a one-piece or unitary body comprised of a first portion 106 and a second portion 110. Optionally, the device 100 can include an elongate body portion 101. The elongate body portion 101 may have tapered ends at respective interfaces with said first portion 106 and second portion Optionally, the elongate body 101 can have a groove or trench 102 or grooves or trenches arranged thereon, for instance longitudinally as indicated by groove 102. The groove 102 may make body 101 more flexible, for instance, for insertion of the device in and through an eyelet. Further, the groove 102 may assist with compression and elastic expansion in order to avoid crumples and to facilitate threading the frame into the eyelet. The one-piece body can be flexible and elastic, made out of any suitable material, such as an elastomer (e.g., synthetic rubber) or the like. That is, the body may be bent or otherwise manipulated to take a particular form or shape, for instance, to position, insert, or otherwise affix or arrange the device to an item or article as set forth herein. See, for example, FIGS. 8-1 5B, 1 6B, 1 6C, 1 6D, 1 7B, 23, and 27. Portions of the body, during placement, positioning, arranging, and/or affixing of the device on or to an item or article, and/or during use or wear of the item or article, may stretch or be caused to stretch. Thus, the body may be caused to expand or contract when different forces are experienced. Upon removal of the device from the item or article, the device may return to its original form (e.g., non-stretched, uncompressed, and optionally non-bent form) or substantially original form. The first portion 106 can form or define a ring or annular part with a hollow portion 1 07 and may be at an end 1 04 of portion 1 01 (or in embodiments portion 104 may be considered part of first portion 106). The inside of the ring in plan view may be one of circular, oval, rectangular, or square. Further, in embodiments, the ring may be reinforced with respect to other portions of the body, for instance based on its thickness, its composition, or a hardened material embedded therein, such as a plastic or metallic ring or semi-ring. Such reinforcement or otherwise constitution of the ring can increase resistance to tearing, for instance. First portion 106 can also include a single, flexible elongate digit or protrusion 108 as an extremity of the device 100. Alternatively, the elongate digit or protrusion 108 may be relatively rigid, as compared to the first portion 106. Optionally, the tip of the protrusion 108 may be rounded or pointed. The protrusion 108 may extend from the ring at an angle 180 degrees from the juncture at which the ring meets portion 1 04 of the device 100. In its original or as-formed form (e.g., non-twisted, unbent form), the ring may have its hollow portion 107 oriented such that an axis passing through the center of the hollow portion 107 is perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the device 1 00. As will be discussed below, protrusion 108 may assist with insertion of the device 1 00 through an eyelet for instance - a needle tip if you will. Protrusion 108 also may assist with maintaining retention of the first portion 106 and the second portion 110 together. Second portion 1 1 0 may be at an end 1 03 of portion 1 01 (or in embodiments portion 103 may be considered part of second portion 110). Second portion 1 1 0 can have a first face and a second face opposite to the first face. The first face can have a wall which can have an upstanding portion 114 and an anchor portion 111. The second face may be substantially smooth. Incidentally, the term “anchor” is used to denote that portion 1 1 1 can be used for coupling the first portion 106 to the second portion 1 10 as will be described below in greater detail. Anchor portion 1 1 1 may be defined as a projection or protrusion which extends from the wall. In embodiments, anchor portion 1 1 1 may be reinforced with respect to other portions of the body, for instance based on its thickness, its composition, a hardened material embedded therein, such as a plastic or metallic plug, and/or its structural configuration. Such reinforcement may assist with retention of the ring of the first portion 106 around the anchor portion 111. Alternatively, anchor portion 1 1 1 may be made of a different material - harder or more rigid, for instance - than surrounding portions, such as end 1 03, flange 1 1 3, and wall portion 1 1 4. For example, anchor portion 1 1 1 may be made of a plastic, whereas surrounding portions may be made of a more flexible elastomer. As with the case of a reinforced anchor portion 1 1 1, a harder, more rigid anchor portion 1 1 1 may assist with retention of the ring of the first portion 1 06 around the anchor portion 111. That is, a more stable and reliable anchor structure may be provided for the first portion 106 to be coupled to. Anchor portion 1 1 1 may have any suitable configuration, such as generally cylindrical. The anchor portion 1 1 1 in plan view may be one of oval, circular, rectangular, or square. Optionally, the plan view shape of the anchor portion 1 1 1 may be identical to the plan view shape of the inside of the ring. Alternatively, the plan view shape of the anchor portion 1 1 1 may not be identical to the plan view shape of the inside of the ring. Optionally, anchor portion 1 1 1 may have a sidewall with a continuous groove 112, for instance. Alternatively, the groove 112 may be discontinuous. Groove 112 may be sized and shaped based on the size and shape of the ring of first portion 106 so that the first portion 106 can be coupled to the anchor portion 111. Alternatively, anchor portion 1 1 1 may have in the place of groove 112 a convex portion and a corresponding groove may be formed along the inner wall of the ring of the first portion 1 06 so these portions of the anchor portion 1 1 1 and the first portion 1 06 fit together nicely. In embodiments, anchor portion 1 1 1 can have a mixture of convex and concave (i.e., grooved) portions around its sidewall and the inner portion of the ring of the first portion 106 can have complementary convex and concave portions. Thus, it is apparent that embodiments of the present invention contemplate a number of complementary mating features for the anchor portion 1 1 1 and the first portion 106, and the above-indicated configurations are merely nonlimiting examples. Anchor portion 1 1 1 may have a top thereof that is flat or domed. Thus, in embodiments, where anchor portion 1 1 1 includes a domed top and a continuous groove 1 1 2, the anchor portion 1 1 1 may be mushroom shaped (e.g., as shown in FIGS. 4-6). The groove 112 can be sized to receive a corresponding portion of the inside of the ring. In embodiments, optionally, a portion of the wall may form a flange 113 around the base of the anchor portion 111. The flange 1 1 3 may completely surround anchor portion 1 1 1 in plan view, or it may partially surround anchor portion 111. The wall may also have a portion thereof 1 14 which defines a first opening or aperture 115, which provides access to a tunnel or a channel formed in the second portion 110. Wall portion 114 may rise vertically or alternatively generally upward and away from anchor portion 1 1 1 and may be characterized as an upstand or upstanding wall. Optionally, the channel or tunnel may be a dead end tunnel/channel having an end thereof formed by the second portion 110. Alternatively, and as shown in FIG. 3, the second portion 110 can include a second opening 105 on the second side of the device 100 opposite the first side of the device 100 associated with the wall portion 114 and the anchor portion 111. The second opening 105 can provide access to the tunnel or channel. The tunnel or channel can be used as container for the protrusion 108, for instance, to act as a shield or barrier against unwanted or inadvertent external forces attempting to act on the protrusion 108. FIGS. 8-14 show various views of device 100 with first and second portions 106, 110 properly coupled together. As shown in FIGS. 8-14, the first portion 106 and the second portion 110 are coupled such that the first face of the second portion 1 10 faces the second face of the first portion 106. Optionally, portions 106, 110 may be rotated with respect to each other such that the first face of the second portion 1 1 0 faces the first face of the first portion 106 when portions 106, 110 are properly coupled together. As shown in FIGS. 8-14, the inside 107 of the ring of the first portion 106 is sized to fit around the anchor portion 111, and the first opening 115 and the channel or tunnel are sized such that the projection 108 fits therethrough and therein, respectively, with a base of the projection 108 arranged adjacent to the first opening 115. More specifically, for coupling the first and second portions 106, 1 10 together, the ring of the first portion 106 can elastically fit around the groove 1 1 2 of the anchor portion 1 1 1 such that the hollow portion 1 07 of the ring is taken up by the body of the anchor portion 111. In the case where flange 1 1 3 is implemented, the face of the ring portion 1 06 may rest on the flange 1 1 3. The extreme-most portion of the projection 108 may be rounded as shown in FIGS. 1-5, or it may form a relatively sharp point. The projection may fit inside of the tunnel or channel via first opening or aperture 115. In embodiments having no second opening or aperture 105, the projection 108 may be completely hidden. In the case of embodiments having optional opening or aperture 105, the projection 108 may be visible through the second opening 105. Optionally, the projection 108 does not project from a plane defining the second aperture when the projection 108 is fully and properly positioned within the tunnel or channel. In embodiments, proper positioning of the projection 108 can mean when the base of the projection 108 is adjacent to the first opening 115. Alternatively, the projection may project from the plane defining the second aperture when the projection 108 is fully and properly positioned within the tunnel or channel. In embodiments, anchor portion 1 1 1 may have on its upper face, which is visible and not concealed when the first and second portions 106, 110 are coupled together, a removable and replaceable portion (not explicitly shown). The removable and replaceable portion may be removable and replaceable to change a color configuration of the device and/or to change a logo or other indicia on the upper face of the protrusion. FIG. 15A is a front perspective view of a plurality of fastening devices 100 arranged in footwear 200. The plurality of devices 100 may come as part of a kit or package of devices 1 00. Optionally, the kit may contain more devices 100 than shown. FIG. 15B is a front perspective view of a plurality of fastening devices 100 arranged in an article of clothing 250. The plurality of devices 1 00 may come as part of a kit or package of devices 1 00. Optionally, the kit may contain more devices 100 than shown. As indicated herein, devices according to embodiments of the present invention are not limited to being used with the footwear and shorts shown in FIGS. 15A and 15B. FIGS. 16A-16C show a fastening device 300 according to another embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 16D shows a plurality of fastening devices 300 according to FIGS. 16A through 16C arranged in an article of footwear 350. Device 300 has a first end portion 306, a second end portion 310, and a body portion 301 between the first and second end portions 306, 310. The body portion 301 may be flexible so as to bend in order to allow the first end portion 306 to be positioned relative to the second end portion 310, for instance as shown in FIGS. 16C and 16D, with part of the body portion 301 residing within an inner or inside portion of second end portion 310. Body portion 301 may, in its natural form, be non-arcuate. Alternatively, in its natural form, the body portion 301 may be curved or arcuate. The arcuate orientation of the body portion 301 may be such that it suggests the direction in which to manipulate the first end portion 306 relative to the second end portion 310 in order to properly couple the end portions together, such as shown in FIG. 16D. Furthermore, second end portion 310 may be configured and operative as an anchor portion so to speak to prevent the first end portion 306 from moving at all or optionally to a degree whereby the first end portion 306 and second end portion 310 would be no longer coupled together. Thus, in embodiments, second end portion 310 may allow the body portion 301 and first end portion 306 to move relative to it, or vice versa without the ends coming uncoupled. The second end portion 310 may be configured with an open end portion 311 and a curved sidewall having opposing ends 312, 313 that define an access 314 to the inside portion formed by the curved sidewall. Access 314 may have a narrowest part that tapers or widens at one or both ends thereof. FIGS. 16A-16D, for example, show access 314 tapering at opposite ends. Access 314 provides a means by which to couple (and decouple) the first end portion 306 to the second end portion 310. More specifically, first end portion 306 may be arranged relative to the second end portion 310 in overlapping fashion as implied by FIG. 16C such that the body portion 301 is adjacent access 314 and such that the first end portion 306, in this embodiment the ball-shaped portion, extends past the access 314. Body portion 301, which may be slightly larger than access 314, can be arranged within the inside portion formed by the curved sidewall via access 314 as shown in FIG. 16C. Opposing ends 312, 313 may be caused to deform slightly as the body portion 301 is arranged within the inside portion. In embodiments, access 314 does not allow radial inward or outward access to and from the inside portion by the first end portion 306. The first end portion 306 may be configured as a ball or some other bulbous or enlarged formation with respect to body portion 301 attached to or formed in one piece with the body portion 301. First end portion 306 can be sized to fit into the inside portion of the second end portion 310. In embodiments, the first end portion 306 may be held in place at a location about the inside portion. Optionally, second end portion 310 may allow the body portion 301 and first end portion 306 to move relative to it, or vice versa, without the ends coming uncoupled. FIG. 17A shows a top view of a fastening device 400 according to yet another embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 17B shows a portion of the fastening device 400 shown in FIG. 17A. Device 400 can have a one-piece or unitary body comprised of a first portion 406 and a second portion 410. Optionally, the device 400 can include an elongate body portion 401. Generally speaking, the body portion 401 can be flexible so as to bend in order to allow the first end portion 406 to be coupled to the second end portion 410. Optionally, the elongate body 401 can have a groove or trench or grooves or trenches arranged thereon (not shown), for instance longitudinally. Such a groove or grooves may make body 401 more flexible, for instance, for insertion of the device in and through an eyelet. Further, such groove or grooves may assist with compression and elastic expansion in order to avoid crumples and to facilitate threading the frame into the eyelet. The one-piece body can be flexible and elastic, made out of any suitable material, such as an elastomer (e.g., synthetic rubber) or the like. That is, the body may be bent or otherwise manipulated to take a particular form or shape, for instance, to position, insert, or otherwise affix or arrange the device to an item or article as set forth herein. Portions of the body, during placement, positioning, arranging, and/or affixing of the device 400 on or to an item or article, and/or during use or wear of the item or article, may stretch or be caused to stretch. Thus, the body may be caused to expand or contract when different forces are experienced. Upon removal of the device 400 from the item or article, the device 400 may return to its original form (e.g., non-stretched, uncompressed, and optionally non-bent form) or substantially original form. In embodiments, one or both of the end portions 406, 410 may be separately made pieces that are fixedly coupled to the body portion 401. For instance, second end portion 410 may be a separate piece that is coupled to body portion 401. In embodiments, second end portion 410 may be made from a different material, plastic for instance, than the material from which body portion 401 and/or first end portion 406 are made (e.g., the flexible and elastic material mentioned above). The first portion 406 can form or define a ring or annular part with a hollow portion 407. The inside of the ring in plan view may be one of circular, oval, rectangular, or square. Further, in embodiments, the ring may be reinforced with respect to other portions of the body, for instance based on its thickness, its composition, ora hardened material embedded therein, such as a plastic or metallic ring or semi-ring. Such reinforcement or otherwise constitution of the ring can increase resistance to tearing, for instance. Second portion 410 can include an anchor portion 411. As with previous embodiments, the term “anchor” is used to denote that portion 41 1 can be used for coupling the first portion 406 to the second portion 410. Anchor portion 41 1 may be defined as a projection or protrusion which extends from a base of the second portion 410. In embodiments, anchor portion 41 1 may be reinforced with respect to other portions of the body, for instance based on its thickness, its composition, a hardened material embedded therein, such as a plastic or metallic plug, and/or its structural configuration. Such reinforcement may assist with retention of the ring of the first portion 406 around the anchor portion 41 1. Alternatively, anchor portion 41 1 may be made of a different material - harder or more rigid, for instance - than surrounding portions. For example, anchor portion 41 1 may be made of a plastic, whereas other portions of device 400 may be made of a more flexible elastomer. As with the case of a reinforced anchor portion 41 1, a harder, more rigid anchor portion 41 1 may assist with retention of the ring of the first portion 406 around the anchor portion 41 1. That is, a more stable and reliable anchor structure may be provided for the first portion 406 to be coupled to. Anchor portion 41 1 may have any suitable configuration, such as generally cylindrical. The anchor portion 41 1 in plan view may be one of oval, circular, rectangular, or square. Optionally, the plan view shape of the anchor portion 41 1 may be identical to the plan view shape of the inside of the ring. Alternatively, the plan view shape of the anchor portion 41 1 may not be identical the plan view shape of the inside of the ring. Optionally, anchor portion 41 1 may have a sidewall with a continuous groove 412, for instance. Alternatively, the groove 412 may be discontinuous. Groove 412 may be sized and shaped based on the size and shape of the ring of first portion 406 so that the first portion 406 can be coupled to the anchor portion 41 1. The groove 412 can be sized to receive a corresponding portion of the inside of the ring. Alternatively, anchor portion 41 1 may have in the place of groove 412 a convex portion and a corresponding groove may be formed along the inner wall of the ring of the first portion 406 so these portions of the anchor portion 41 1 and the first portion 406 fit together. In embodiments, anchor portion 41 1 can have a mixture of convex and concave (i.e., grooved) portions around its sidewall and the inner portion of the ring of the first portion 406 can have complementary convex and concave portions. Thus, it is apparent that embodiments of the present invention contemplate a number of complementary mating features for the anchor portion 41 1 and the ring of first portion 406. Accordingly, the above-indicated configurations are meant as non-limiting examples. Anchor portion 41 1 may have a top portion 413 thereof that is flat, domed, concave, or which defines an opening. In embodiments, anchor portion 411 may have on its upper face a removable and replaceable portion. For instance, top portion 413 may be removable and replaceable to change a color configuration of the device and/or to change a logo or other indicia on the upper face of the protrusion. Optionally, top portion 413 may be used as a base to attach charms or the like, for instance. Regarding coupling of the first end portion 406 to the second end portion 410, the inside 407 of the ring of the first portion 406 is sized to fit around the anchor portion 41 1. More specifically, for coupling the first and second portions 406, 410 together, the ring of the first portion 406 can elastically fit around the groove 412 of the anchor portion 41 1 such that the hollow portion 407 of the ring is taken up by the body of the anchor portion 411. FIGS. 18-20 show top views of fastening devices 500, 600, 700 according to additional embodiments of the present invention. Devices 500, 600, 700 can have a one-piece or unitary body comprised of respective first portions 506, 606, 706 and second portions 510, 610, 710. Optionally, the devices can include an elongate body portion 501, 601, 701. Generally speaking, the body portions 501, 601, 701 can be flexible so as to bend in order to allow respective first end portions 506, 606, 706 to be coupled to corresponding second end portions 510, 610, 710. Optionally, in embodiments, such as device 500 in FIG. 18 and device 600 in FIG. 19, the body portion may be bifurcated with a hollow or void 502, 602 between the two fractions. Optionally, the elongate bodies 501, 601, 701 can have a groove or trench or grooves or trenches arranged thereon (not shown), for instance longitudinally. Such a groove or grooves may make the bodies more flexible, for instance. Further, such groove or grooves may assist with compression and elastic expansion in order to avoid crumples and to facilitate threading. The one-piece body can be flexible and elastic, made out of any suitable material, such as an elastomer (e.g., synthetic rubber) or the like. That is, the body may be bent or otherwise manipulated to take a particular form or shape, for instance, to position, insert, or otherwise affix or arrange the device to an item or article as set forth herein. Portions of the body, during placement, positioning, arranging, and/or affixing of the devices 500, 600, 700 on or to an item or article, and/or during use or wear of the item or article, may stretch or be caused to stretch. Thus, the body may be caused to expand or contract when different forces are experienced. Upon removal of the device 500/600/700 from the item or article, the device 500/600/700 may return to its original form (e.g., non-stretched, uncompressed, and optionally non-bent form) or substantially original form. In embodiments, one or both of the end portions 506/606/706 and 510/610/710 may be separately made pieces that are fixedly coupled to the corresponding body portion 501/601/701. For instance, second end portion 510, 610, 710 may be a separate piece that is coupled to body portion 501, 601, 701. In embodiments, the second end portion may be made from a different material, plastic for instance, than the material from which body portion and/or first end portion are made (e.g., the flexible and elastic material mentioned above). In FIGS. 18 and 19, each of the devices 500, 600 has a first end portion 506, 606 with an extremity 507, 607 thereof that can be used to assist with insertion of the device through an eyelet, for instance, and for grasping by the wearer to assist with coupling the first end portion to the second end portion. In devices 500, 600, second end portions 510, 610 have a Y-shaped channel 51 2, 612 formed in-part by a projecting part 51 1, 61 1 at the fork or part at which the channel branches into two paths. The shape and configuration of the channel 51 2, 61 2 and the projecting part 511,611 is complementary with the configuration of the juncture 508, 608 at which the first end portion 506, 606 meets the body portion 501, 601 and the size and shape of the first end portion 506, 606. Further, the extremity 507, 607 of the first end portion 506, 606 is sized and shaped so as to securely and frictionally fit within the base portion of the Y-shaped channel. Thus, when the first end portion 506, 606 and the second end portion 510, 610 are properly coupled together, first end portion 506, 606 are arranged inside trench 512, 612 such that the juncture 508, 608 is at the fork or part at which the channel 512, 612 branches into two paths with the extremity 507, 607 facing inwardly, toward body portion 501, 601. Optionally, extremity 507, 607 may overlap hollow or void 502, 602 in plan view when the first and second end portions are properly coupled together. Put another way, extremity 507, 607 may project into hollow or void 502, 602 when the first and second end portions are properly coupled together. Device 700 shown in FIG. 20 expresses a variation in the coupling concept shown and described with respect to devices 500 and 600 in FIGS. 18 and 19, respectively. First end portion 706 of device 700 includes a hollow or void portion 707 (e.g., similar to the ring of previously discussed embodiments). Second end portion 710 includes an anchor portion 71 1 having a projection 712. The projection and the hollow portion 707 can be sized and shaped to be coupled together. For instance, hollow portion 707 can fit around projection 712 when the two end portions 706, 710 are properly coupled together. FIGS. 21 A-C show views of portions of an adjustable fastening device 800 according to embodiments of the present invention. Generally speaking, fastening device 800 can be adjustable to provide a tighter (or looser) fit and/or based on a size or distance of an article or item to which it is attached. For example, the device 800 can be adjusted to make its length longer for arrangement in two eyelets of an adults shoe as compared to its length for arrangement in two eyelets in a child or teenager’s shoe. As another example, the device 800 can be adjusted based on whether the device 800 is oriented horizontally, from one eyelet to another eyelet at the one eyelet’s level, or non-horizontally, either diagonally or vertically, from one eyelet to another eyelet below or above the one eyelet, whether in its same column or the opposing column of eyelets. Fastening device 800 can have a body portion 801 and an end portion 810. Movably coupled to end portion 810 can be a movable bracket 820 that is movable along the axis of the body portion 801.

For instance, in embodiments, one end of the device may be inserted through one eyelet of a shoe, passed over or under the tongue, and through the other of the eyelets. The end being passed through the eyelets may be temporarily deformed, for instance between a wearer’s fingers, in order to fit through the eyelets. Furthermore, a longitudinal body portion between the ends of the device may also temporarily deform as it passes through each eyelet. In embodiments device(s) having a longitudinal groove in a longitudinal body portion thereof (e.g., item 102 in FIG. 3), the groove may make the longitudinal body portion softer and more flexible for insertion and passage of the body portion through eyelets or the like. After the device is positioned or inserted through one or more eyelets, loops, hooks, holes, openings, or the like, the device may arranged such that its ends are coupled together (S2806), as shown in FIGS. 8, 15A, and 15B, for example. Of course other disclosed and shown embodiments may have their ends connected together according to their own unique coupling mechanisms. Further, in embodiments, multiple devices may be coupled together in end-to-end fashion, thereby forming a relatively longer fastening device. Alternatively, in embodiments such as those shown in FIGS. 21A-21C and 22A-22E, the ends of the device may not be threaded through the eyelets, loops, hooks, holes, openings, or the like as indicated above, but rather, each end may be inserted through a corresponding eyelet, loop, hook, opening, or the like. See, for instance, FIG. 23, which shows a plurality of devices 1300 from FIG. 22E having ends 1311 inserted into respective shoe eyelets on one side of a shoe. Though not shown, ends opposite ends 1 31 1 for each device 1 300 are identical to those shown and can fit into respective shoe eyelets on the other side of the shoe. Though not explicitly shown in the figures, a fastening means as indicated according to item 19 in FIG. 7 of U.S. Patent No. 7,506,420 or a variation thereof based on the configuration of the individual fastening device(s) may also be employed with embodiments of the present invention.
