3-(4,4-Difluorobut-3-en-1-yl)-6-(hydroxymethyl)-1-(2-methoxyethyl)-5-methylthieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione
At −40° C., 735 μl (0.735 mmol) of a 1 M solution of lithium aluminium hydride in THF were added dropwise to a solution of 345 mg (0.735 mmol) of the compound from Example 364A in 17 ml of dry THF. On completion of addition, stirring was continued at RT for 1 h. Then 1 ml of 10% hydrochloric acid was added cautiously. 100 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution were added to the mixture, and the aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The residue obtained was chromatographed using a silica gel cartridge (Biotage, 25 g of silica gel, eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate). 133 mg (49% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
