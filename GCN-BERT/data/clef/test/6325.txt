In the structures depicted throughout this specification and the claims, a solid line indicates a bond, and each dashed line represents a bond having varying degrees of covalency and a varying degree of coordination. The terms “hydrocarbyl radical,” “hydrocarbyl” and “hydrocarbyl group” are used interchangeably throughout this document unless otherwise specified. For purposes of this disclosure, a hydrocarbyl radical is defined to be C1 to C70 radicals, or C1 to C20 radicals, or C1 to C10 radicals, or C6 to C70 radicals, or C6 to C20 radicals, or C7 to C20 radicals that may be linear, branched, or cyclic where appropriate (aromatic or non-aromatic); and includes hydrocarbyl radicals substituted with other hydrocarbyl radicals and/or one or more functional groups comprising elements from Groups 13-17 of the periodic table of the elements.

Likewise the terms “functional group”, “group” and “substituent” are also used interchangeably throughout this document unless otherwise specified. For purposes herein, a functional group includes both organic and inorganic radicals and moieties comprising elements from Groups 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 of the periodic table of elements. Suitable functional groups may include hydrocarbyl radicals, e.g., alkyl radicals, alkene radicals, aryl radicals, and/or halogen (Cl, Br, I, F), O, S, Se, Te, NR*x, OR*, SeR*, TeR*, PR*x, AsR*x, SbR*x, SR*, BR*x, SiR*x, GeR*x, SnR*x, PbR*x, and/or the like, wherein R* is a C1 to C20 hydrocarbyl as defined above and wherein x is the appropriate integer to provide an electron neutral moiety. Other examples of functional groups include those typically referred to as amines, imides, amides, ethers, alcohols (hydroxides), sulfides, sulfates, phosphides, halides, phosphonates, alkoxides, esters, carboxylates, aldehydes, and the like. For purposes herein “direct bonds,” “direct covalent bonds” or “directly bridged” are used interchangeably to refer to covalent bonds directly between atoms that do not have any intervening atoms. For purposes herein an “olefin,” alternatively referred to as “alkene,” is a linear, branched, or cyclic compound comprising carbon and hydrogen having at least one double bond. For purposes of this specification and the claims appended thereto, when a polymer or copolymer is referred to as comprising an olefin, the olefin present in such polymer or copolymer is the polymerized form of the olefin. For example, when a copolymer is said to have an “ethylene” content of 35 wt % to 55 wt %, it is understood that the mer unit in the copolymer is derived from ethylene in the polymerization reaction and said derived units are present at 35 wt % to 55 wt %, based upon the weight of the copolymer. For purposes herein a “polymer” has two or more of the same or different “mer” units. A “homopolymer” is a polymer having mer units that are the same. A “copolymer” is a polymer having two or more mer units that are different from each other. A “terpolymer” is a polymer having three mer units that are different from each other. “Different” in reference to mer units indicates that the mer units differ from each other by at least one atom or are different isomerically. Accordingly, the definition of copolymer, as used herein, includes terpolymers and the like. An oligomer is typically a polymer having a low molecular weight, such as an Mn of less than 25,000 g/mol, or in an embodiment according to the invention less than 2,500 g/mol, or a low number of mer units, such as 75 mer units or less. An “ethylene polymer” or “ethylene copolymer” is a polymer or copolymer comprising at least 50 mole % ethylene derived units, a “propylene polymer” or “propylene copolymer” is a polymer or copolymer comprising at least 50 mole % propylene derived units, and so on. For the purposes of this disclosure, the term “α-olefin” includes C2-C22 olefins. Non-limiting examples of α-olefins include ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, 1-undecene 1-dodecene, 1-tridecene, 1-tetradecene, 1-pentadecene, 1-hexadecene, 1-heptadecene, 1-octadecene, 1-nonadecene, 1-eicosene, 1-heneicosene, 1-docosene, 1-tricosene, 1-tetracosene, 1-pentacosene, 1-hexacosene, 1-heptacosene, 1-octacosene, 1-nonacosene, 1-triacontene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 3-methyl-1-pentene, 5-methyl-1-nonene, 3,5,5-trimethyl-1-hexene, vinylcyclohexane, and vinylnorbornane.

The terms “catalyst”, “catalyst compound”, and “transition metal compound” are defined to mean a compound capable of initiating polymerization catalysis under the appropriate conditions. In the description herein, the catalyst may be described as a catalyst precursor, a pre-catalyst compound, or a transition metal compound, and these terms are used interchangeably. A catalyst compound may be used by itself to initiate catalysis or may be used in combination with an activator to initiate catalysis. When the catalyst compound is combined with an activator to initiate catalysis, the catalyst compound is often referred to as a pre-catalyst or catalyst precursor. A “catalyst system” is combination of at least one catalyst compound, at least one activator, an optional co-activator, and an optional support material, where the system can polymerize monomers to polymer. For the purposes of this invention and the claims thereto, when catalyst systems are described as comprising neutral stable forms of the components it is well understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the ionic form of the component is the form that reacts with the monomers to produce polymers. For purposes herein the term “catalyst productivity” is a measure of how many grams of polymer (P) are produced using a polymerization catalyst comprising W g of catalyst (cat), over a period of time of T hours; and may be expressed by the following formula: P/(T×W) and expressed in units of gPgcat−1hr−1. Conversion is the amount of monomer that is converted to polymer product, and is reported as mol % and is calculated based on the polymer yield and the amount of monomer fed into the reactor. Catalyst activity is a measure of how active the catalyst is and is reported as the mass of product polymer (P) produced per mole of catalyst (cat) used (kg P/mol cat). An “anionic ligand” is a negatively charged ligand which donates one or more pairs of electrons to a metal ion. A “neutral donor ligand” is a neutrally charged ligand which donates one or more pairs of electrons to a metal ion. A scavenger is a compound that is typically added to facilitate polymerization by scavenging impurities. Some scavengers may also act as activators and may be referred to as co-activators. A co-activator, that is not a scavenger, may also be used in conjunction with an activator in order to form an active catalyst. In an embodiment according to the invention a co-activator can be pre-mixed with the catalyst compound to form an alkylated catalyst compound. As used herein, Mn is number average molecular weight as determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR) unless stated otherwise, Mw is weight average molecular weight determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and Mz is z average molecular weight determined by GPC, wt % is weight percent, and mol % is mole percent. Molecular weight distribution (MWD) is defined to be Mw divided by Mn. Unless otherwise noted, all molecular weight units, e.g., Mw, Mn, Mz, are reported in g/mol. The following abbreviations may be used through this specification: Me is methyl, Ph is phenyl, Et is ethyl, Pr is propyl, iPr is isopropyl, n-Pr is normal propyl, Bu is butyl, iso-butyl is isobutyl, sec-butyl refers to secondary butyl, tert-butyl, t-butyl, tert-Bu, or t-Bu refers to tertiary butyl, n-butyl is normal butyl, pMe is para-methyl, Bn is benzyl, THF is tetrahydrofuran, Mes is mesityl, also known as 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, Tol is toluene, TMS is trimethylsilyl, TIBAL is triisobutylaluminum, TNOAL is triisobutyl n-octylaluminum, MAO is methylalumoxane, MOMO is methoxymethoxy (also referred to as methoxymethyl ether), N is nitrogen (including that Na, Nb, N1, N2 are nitrogen) and O is oxygen (including that Oa, Ob, O1, O2 are oxygen). Further, Na and N1, N2 and Nb, Oa and O1, and Ob and O2 are equivalent and may be used interchangeably between formulae. For purposes herein whenever a composition, an element or a group of elements is preceded with the transitional phrase “comprising”, it is understood that we also contemplate the same composition or group of elements with transitional phrases “consisting essentially of,” “consisting of”, “selected from the group of consisting of,” or “is” preceding the recitation of the composition, element, or elements and vice versa. For purposes herein, RT is room temperature, which is defined as 25° C. unless otherwise specified. All percentages are weight percent (wt %) unless otherwise specified. In the description herein, the salenol catalyst may be described as a catalyst precursor, a pre-catalyst compound, salenol catalyst compound, bridged salenol catalyst compound or a transition metal compound, and these terms are used interchangeably. Polypropylene microstructure is determined by 13C-NMR spectroscopy, including the concentration of isotactic and syndiotactic dyads ([m] and [r]), triads ([mm] and [rr]), and pentads ([mmmm] and [rrrr]). The designation “m” or “r” describes the stereochemistry of pairs of contiguous propylene groups, “m” referring to meso and “r” to racemic. Samples are dissolved in d2-1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, and spectra recorded at 125° C. using a 100 MHz (or higher) NMR spectrometer. Polymer resonance peaks are referenced to mmmm=21.8 ppm. Calculations involved in the characterization of polymers by NMR are described by F. A. Bovey in Polymer Conformation and Configuration (Academic Press, New York 1969) and J. Randall in Polymer Sequence Determination, 13C-NMR Method (Academic Press, New York, 1977). Melting point (Tm or Tmelt), also referred to as melting temperature, and heat of fusion (Hf) of polymers are determined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) on a commercially available instrument (e.g., TA Instruments 2920 DSC). Typically, 6 to 10 mg of molded polymer or plasticized polymer are sealed in an aluminum pan and loaded into the instrument at room temperature. Melting data (first heat) is acquired by heating the sample to at least 30° C. above its melting temperature, typically 220° C. for polypropylene, at a heating rate of 10° C./min. The sample is held for at least 5 minutes at this temperature to destroy its thermal history. Crystallization data are acquired by cooling the sample from the melt to at least 50° C. below the crystallization temperature, typically −50° C. for polypropylene, at a cooling rate of 20° C./min. The sample is held at this temperature for at least 5 minutes, and finally heated at 10° C./min to acquire additional melting data (second heat). The endothermic melting transition (first and second heat) and exothermic crystallization transition are analyzed according to standard procedures. The melting temperatures reported are the peak melting temperatures from the second heat unless otherwise specified. For polymers displaying multiple peaks, the melting temperature is defined to be the peak melting temperature from the melting trace associated with the largest endothermic calorimetric response (as opposed to the peak occurring at the highest temperature). Areas under the DSC curve are used to determine the heat of transition (heat of fusion, Hf, upon melting), which can be used to calculate the degree of crystallinity (also called the percent crystallinity). The percent crystallinity (X %) is calculated using the formula: [area under the curve (in J/g)/H° (in J/g)]*100, where H° is the ideal heat of fusion for a perfect crystal of the homopolymer of the major monomer component. These values for H° are to be obtained from the Polymer Handbook, Fourth Edition, published by John Wiley and Sons, New York 1999, except that a value of 290 J/g is used for H° (polyethylene), a value of 140 J/g is used for H° (polybutene), and a value of 207 J/g is used for H° (polypropylene). For purposes herein, a chiral carbon is indicated by a C* and/or at least two of the substituents are indicated using the flying wedge and dotted wedge depictions known in the art. For purposes herein, unless otherwise specified, a structure comprising a chiral carbon, whether expressly indicated or not, includes the enantiomerically pure compound or compounds in the case of multiple chiral carbons, the racemic mixture of compounds, or a combination thereof, including racemic mixtures combined with enantiomerically pure isomers in the case of multiple chiral carbons present in the same molecule. For purposes herein, a bulky ligand substitution on a salenol catalyst compound is defined as a C4 to C20 hydrocarbyl radical; —SRa, —NRa2 and —PRa2, where each Ra is independently a C4 to C20 hydrocarbyl; or a C4 to C20 hydrocarbyl substituted organometalloid. The molecular volume of a substituent is used herein as an approximation of spatial steric bulk. Comparison of substituents with differing molecular volumes allows the substituent with the smaller molecular volume to be considered “less bulky” in comparison to the substituent with the larger molecular volume. Conversely, a substituent with a larger molecular volume may be considered “more bulky” than a substituent with a smaller molecular volume. Molecular volume may be calculated as reported in “A Simple ‘Back of the Envelope’ Method for Estimating the Densities and Molecular Volumes of Liquids and Solids,” Journal of Chemical Education, Vol. 71, No. 11, November 1994, pp. 962-964. Molecular volume (MV), in units of cubic Å, is calculated using the formula: MV=8.3 Vs, where Vs is the scaled volume, which is the sum of the relative volumes of the constituent atoms, and is calculated from the molecular formula of the substituent using the following table of relative volumes. For fused rings, the Vs is decreased by 7.5% per fused ring. Element Relative Volume, Å (Vs) H 1 1st short period, Li to F 2 2nd short period, Na to Cl 4 1st long period, K to Br 5 2nd long period, Rb to I 7.5 3rd long period, Cs to Bi 9 For purposes herein, a bulky substituent is defined as any substituent having a molecular volume greater than or equal to a tertiary-butyl substitution (MV=8.3 Vs=141.1). Examples of other suitable bulky substituents include adamantyl, halo substituted and unsubstituted aryl functional groups, and the like. For purposes herein, a salenol catalyst compound refers to a non-symmetric tetradentate ligand system comprising an imine group bound to a phenol arm and an amine group bound to an alcoholate arm bridged to the phenol arm, coordinated with a metal. The salenol ligand system includes [Oa,Na,Nb,Ob] where Oa and Na are attached to the first arm of the ligand comprising the imine-phenolate moiety and Nb and Ob are attached to the second arm of the ligand comprising the alcoholate moiety (O=oxygen and N=nitrogen). The first and second arms of the ligand are attached to each other by a bridge moiety Y between Na and Nb. Each of Oa, Na, Nb, and Ob are coordinated with the metal atom. For purposes herein a bridged salenol catalyst compound has one of the general structures I or II: wherein each solid line represents a covalent bond and each dashed line represents a bond having varying degrees of covalency and a varying degree of coordination and where R1 to R10, M, n, X, X1, X2 and Y are as described below. For purposes herein, a “fac” (facial) configuration refers to a bridged salenol ligand structure (II) where Oa and/or Ob is not in the [Na,Nb,M] plane in a six-coordinated arrangement centered around the metal atom, or stated differently, all three of the atoms [Oa,Na,Nb] and/or all three of the atoms [Na,Nb,Ob] are on the same side ([Oa,Nb] and [Na,Ob] are located cis); whereas in a “mer” (meridional) configuration, Oa and/or Ob are in the [Na,Nb,M] plane, or stated differently, Oa is on the opposite side of the metal center (located trans) with respect to Nb and/or Ob is on the opposite side of the metal center or trans with respect to Na. For purposes herein, in the binary wrapping mode designations, the configuration of [Oa,Na,Nb] is stated first and [Na,Nb,Ob] second, e.g., “fac-mer” refers to fac [Oa,Na,Nb] and mer [Na,Nb,Ob].

Methods to Prepare the Catalyst Compounds. In an embodiment according to the invention, the salenol ligand may be prepared by imine condensation of a diamine bridge compound NH2—Y—NR′″H with an aldehyde located ortho to a hydroxy functional group, e.g., a substituted salicylaldehyde base structure, to form an imine-Y-bridged-amine (Reaction A), followed by reaction of the resultant imine-Y-bridged-amine with an epoxide to produce the salenol ligand (Reaction B). The salenol ligand is then converted into the metal di-substituted catalyst precursor by reaction with a substituted metal compound, also referred to as a “metalating agent”, to yield the finished complex. In an embodiment according to the invention, the salenol ligand is converted into the metal substituted catalyst precursor by reaction with a metalation reagent MX(n+2) where n is 1 or 2, e.g., a metal tri- or tetra-substituted compound to yield the finished complex (reaction C1) or into the metal di-substituted catalyst precursor by reaction with a metalation reagent MX4, e.g., a metal tetra-substituted compound to yield the finished complex (reaction C2). In embodiments according to the invention, the salenol ligand may be contacted with the metalation reagent in Reaction C1 or in Reaction C2 to form the catalyst compound prior to combination with the activator, and subsequently the catalyst compound may be contacted with the activator, with or without isolation of the precursor catalyst compound; or the salenol ligand and the metalation reagent may be contacted in Reaction C1 or in Reaction C2 in the presence of the activator, in the presence of one or more olefins, or a combination thereof, e.g., in an in situ metalation, activation and/or polymerization process. Activators The terms “cocatalyst” and “activator” are used interchangeably to describe activators and are defined to be any compound which can activate any one of the catalyst compounds described above by converting the neutral catalyst compound to a catalytically active catalyst compound cation. Non-limiting activators, for example, include alumoxanes, aluminum alkyls, ionizing activators, which may be neutral or ionic, and conventional-type cocatalysts. Activators may include alumoxane compounds, modified alumoxane compounds, and ionizing anion precursor compounds that abstract a reactive, σ-bound, metal ligand making the metal complex cationic and providing a charge-balancing noncoordinating or weakly coordinating anion. In one embodiment of the invention, alumoxane activators are utilized as an activator in the catalyst composition. Alumoxanes are generally oligomeric compounds containing —Al(R1)—O— sub-units, where R1 is an alkyl radical. Examples of alumoxanes include methylalumoxane (MAO), modified methylalumoxane (MMAO), ethylalumoxane and isobutylalumoxane. Alkylalumoxanes and modified alkylalumoxanes are suitable as catalyst activators, particularly when the catalyst precursor compound comprises an abstractable ligand which is an alkyl, halide, alkoxide or amide. Mixtures of different alumoxanes and modified alumoxanes may also be used. In an embodiment according to the invention, visually clear methylalumoxane may be used. A cloudy or gelled alumoxane can be filtered to produce a clear solution or clear alumoxane can be decanted from the cloudy solution. A useful alumoxane is a modified methyl alumoxane (MMAO) described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,041,584 and/or commercially available from Akzo Chemicals, Inc. under the trade designation Modified Methylalumoxane type 3A. When the activator is an alumoxane (modified or unmodified), in an embodiment according to the invention, the maximum amount of activator is typically present at a 5000-fold molar excess Al/M over the catalyst compound (per metal catalytic site). In an embodiment according to the invention, the minimum activator-to-catalyst-compound, which is determined according to molar concentration of the transition metal M, in an embodiment according to the inventions is 1 mole aluminum or less to mole of transition metal M. In an embodiment according to the invention, the activator comprises alumoxane and the alumoxane is present at a ratio of 1 mole aluminum or more to mole of catalyst compound. In an embodiment according to the invention, the minimum activator-to-catalyst-compound molar ratio is a 1:1 molar ratio. Other embodiments of Al:M ranges include from 1:1 to 500:1, or from 1:1 to 200:1, or from 1:1 to 100:1, or from 1:1 to 50:1. In an embodiment according to the invention, little or no alumoxane (i.e., less than 0.001 wt %) is used in the polymerization processes described herein. In an embodiment according to the invention, alumoxane is present at 0.00 mole %, or the alumoxane is present at a molar ratio of aluminum to catalyst compound transition metal less than 500:1, or less than 300:1, or less than 100:1, or less than 1:1. The term “non-coordinating anion” (NCA) refers to an anion which either does not coordinate to a cation, or which is only weakly coordinated to a cation thereby remaining sufficiently labile to be displaced by a neutral Lewis base. “Compatible” non-coordinating anions are those which are not degraded to neutrality when the initially formed complex decomposes. Further, the anion will not transfer an anionic substituent or fragment to the cation so as to cause it to form a neutral transition metal compound and a neutral by-product from the anion. Non-coordinating anions useful in accordance with this invention are those that are compatible with the polymerization or catalyst system, stabilize the transition metal cation in the sense of balancing its ionic charge at +1, and yet are sufficiently labile to permit displacement during polymerization. In an embodiment according to the invention, an ionizing or stoichiometric activator may be used, which may be neutral or ionic, such as tri(n-butyl)ammonium boron metalloid precursor, polyhalogenated heteroborane anions (WO 98/43983), boric acid (U.S. Pat. No. 5,942,459), or a combination thereof. In an embodiment according to the invention, neutral or ionic activators alone or in combination with alumoxane or modified alumoxane activators may be used. Examples of neutral stoichiometric activators include tri-substituted boron, tellurium, aluminum, gallium, and indium, or mixtures thereof. The three substituent groups or radicals can be the same or different and in an embodiment according to the invention are each independently selected from substituted or unsubstituted alkyls, alkenyls, alkyns, aryls, alkoxy, and halogens. In an embodiment according to the invention, the three groups are independently selected from halogen, mono or multicyclic (including halosubstituted) aryls, alkyls, and alkenyl compounds, and mixtures thereof; or independently selected from alkenyl radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, alkyl radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, alkoxy radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms and aryl or substituted aryl radicals having 3 to 20 carbon atoms. In an embodiment according to the invention, the three substituent groups are alkyl radicals having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, phenyl, naphthyl, or mixtures thereof. In an embodiment according to the invention, the three groups are halogenated aryl groups, e.g., fluorinated aryl groups. In an embodiment according to the invention the neutral stoichiometric activator is tris perfluorophenyl boron or tris perfluoronaphthyl boron. In an embodiment according to the invention, ionic stoichiometric activator compounds may include an active proton, or some other cation associated with, but not coordinated to, or only loosely coordinated to the remaining ion of the ionizing compound.

Blends In an embodiment according to the invention, the polymer (or the polyethylene or polypropylene) produced herein is combined with one or more additional polymers prior to being formed into a film, molded part or other article. Other useful polymers include polyethylene, isotactic polypropylene, highly isotactic polypropylene, syndiotactic polypropylene, random copolymer of propylene and ethylene, and/or butene, and/or hexene, polybutene, ethylene vinyl acetate, LDPE, LLDPE, HDPE, ethylene vinyl acetate, ethylene methyl acrylate, copolymers of acrylic acid, polymethylmethacrylate or any other polymers polymerizable by a high-pressure free radical process, polyvinylchloride, polybutene-1, isotactic polybutene, ABS resins, ethylene-propylene rubber (EPR), vulcanized EPR, EPDM, block copolymer, styrenic block copolymers, polyamides, polycarbonates, PET resins, cross linked polyethylene, copolymers of ethylene and vinyl alcohol (EVOH), polymers of aromatic monomers such as polystyrene, poly-1 esters, polyacetal, polyvinylidine fluoride, polyethylene glycols, and/or polyisobutylene. In an embodiment according to the invention, the polymer (or the polyethylene or polypropylene) is present in the above blends, at from 10 to 99 wt %, based upon the weight of the polymers in the blend, or 20 to 95 wt %, or at least 30 to 90 wt %, or at least 40 to 90 wt %, or at least 50 to 90 wt %, or at least 60 to 90 wt %, or at least 70 to 90 wt %. The blends described above may be produced by mixing the polymers of the invention with one or more polymers (as described above), by connecting reactors together in series to make reactor blends or by using more than one catalyst in the same reactor to produce multiple species of polymer. The polymers can be mixed together prior to being put into the extruder or may be mixed in an extruder. The blends may be formed using conventional equipment and methods, such as by dry blending the individual components and subsequently melt mixing in a mixer, or by mixing the components together directly in a mixer, such as, for example, a Banbury mixer, a Haake mixer, a Brabender internal mixer, or a single or twin-screw extruder, which may include a compounding extruder and a side-arm extruder used directly downstream of a polymerization process, which may include blending powders or pellets of the resins at the hopper of the film extruder. Additionally, additives may be included in the blend, in one or more components of the blend, and/or in a product formed from the blend, such as a film, as desired. Such additives are well known in the art, and can include, for example: fillers; antioxidants (e.g., hindered phenolics such as IRGANOX 1010 or IRGANOX 1076 available from Ciba-Geigy); phosphites (e.g., IRGAFOS 168 available from Ciba-Geigy); anti-cling additives; tackifiers, such as polybutenes, terpene resins, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbon resins, alkali metal and glycerol stearates, and hydrogenated rosins; UV stabilizers; heat stabilizers; anti-blocking agents; release agents; anti-static agents; pigments; colorants; dyes; waxes; silica; fillers; talc; and the like. Films In an embodiment according to the invention, any of the foregoing polymers, such as the foregoing polypropylenes or blends thereof, may be used in a variety of end-use applications. Applications include, for example, mono- or multi-layer blown, extruded, and/or shrink films. These films may be formed by any number of well-known extrusion or coextrusion techniques, such as a blown bubble film processing technique, wherein the composition can be extruded in a molten state through an annular die and then expanded to form a uni-axial or biaxial orientation melt prior to being cooled to form a tubular, blown film, which can then be axially slit and unfolded to form a flat film. Films may be subsequently unoriented, uniaxially oriented, or biaxially oriented to the same or different extents. One or more of the layers of the film may be oriented in the transverse and/or longitudinal directions to the same or different extents. The uniaxial orientation can be accomplished using typical cold drawing or hot drawing methods. Biaxial orientation can be accomplished using tenter frame equipment or a double bubble processes and may occur before or after the individual layers are brought together. For example, a polyethylene layer can be extrusion coated or laminated onto an oriented polypropylene layer or the polyethylene and polypropylene can be coextruded together into a film then oriented. Likewise, oriented polypropylene could be laminated to oriented polyethylene or oriented polyethylene could be coated onto polypropylene then optionally the combination could be oriented even further. Typically the films are oriented in the machine direction (MD) at a ratio of up to 15, or between 5 and 7, and in the transverse direction (TD) at a ratio of up to 15, or 7 to 9. However, In an embodiment according to the invention the film is oriented to the same extent in both the MD and TD directions. The films may vary in thickness depending on the intended application; however, films of a thickness from 1 to 50 μm are usually suitable. Films intended for packaging are usually from 10 to 50 μm thick. The thickness of the sealing layer is typically 0.2 to 50 μm. There may be a sealing layer on both the inner and outer surfaces of the film or the sealing layer may be present on only the inner or the outer surface. In an embodiment according to the invention, one or more layers may be modified by corona treatment, electron beam irradiation, gamma irradiation, flame treatment, or microwave. In an embodiment according to the invention, one or both of the surface layers is modified by corona treatment. Molded Products The compositions described herein (particularly polypropylene compositions) may also be used to prepare molded products in any molding process, including but not limited to, injection molding, gas-assisted injection molding, extrusion blow molding, injection blow molding, injection stretch blow molding, compression molding, rotational molding, foam molding, thermoforming, sheet extrusion, and profile extrusion. The molding processes are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Further, the compositions described herein (particularly polypropylene compositions) may be shaped into desirable end use articles by any suitable means known in the art. Thermoforming, vacuum forming, blow molding, rotational molding, slush molding, transfer molding, wet lay-up or contact molding, cast molding, cold forming matched-die molding, injection molding, spray techniques, profile co-extrusion, or combinations thereof are typically used methods. Thermoforming is a process of forming at least one pliable plastic sheet into a desired shape. Typically, an extrudate film of the composition of this invention (and any other layers or materials) is placed on a shuttle rack to hold it during heating. The shuttle rack indexes into the oven which pre-heats the film before forming. Once the film is heated, the shuttle rack indexes back to the forming tool. The film is then vacuumed onto the forming tool to hold it in place and the forming tool is closed. The tool stays closed to cool the film and the tool is then opened. The shaped laminate is then removed from the tool. The thermoforming is accomplished by vacuum, positive air pressure, plug-assisted vacuum forming, or combinations and variations of these, once the sheet of material reaches thermoforming temperatures, typically of from 140° C. to 185° C. or higher. A pre-stretched bubble step is used, especially on large parts, to improve material distribution. Blow molding is another suitable forming means for use with the compositions of this invention, which includes injection blow molding, multi-layer blow molding, extrusion blow molding, and stretch blow molding, and is especially suitable for substantially closed or hollow objects, such as, for example, gas tanks and other fluid containers. Blow molding is described in more detail in, for example, CONCISE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF POLYMER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING 90-92 (Jacqueline I. Kroschwitz, ed., John Wiley & Sons 1990). Likewise, molded articles may be fabricated by injecting molten polymer into a mold that shapes and solidifies the molten polymer into desirable geometry and thickness of molded articles. Sheets may be made either by extruding a substantially flat profile from a die, onto a chill roll, or by calendaring. Sheets are generally considered to have a thickness of from 254 μm to 2540 μm (10 mils to 100 mils), although any given sheet may be substantially thicker. Non-Wovens and Fibers The polyolefin compositions described above may also be used to prepare nonwoven fabrics and fibers of this invention in any nonwoven fabric and fiber making process, including but not limited to, melt blowing, spunbonding, film aperturing, and staple fiber carding. A continuous filament process may also be used. Or a spunbonding process is used. The spunbonding process is well known in the art. Generally it involves the extrusion of fibers through a spinneret. These fibers are then drawn using high velocity air and laid on an endless belt. A calender roll is generally then used to heat the web and bond the fibers to one another although other techniques may be used such as sonic bonding and adhesive bonding.
