Latin name of the genus and species: The Latin name of the genus and species of the plant variety disclosed herein is Prunus×gondouinii (Poit. & Turpin) Rehder (P. avium (L.) L.×P. cerasus L.). Variety denomination: The inventive cultivar of Prunus×gondouinii (Poit. & Turpin) Rehder (P. avium (L.) L.×P. cerasus L.) disclosed herein has been given the varietal denomination ‘STO1.’ BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of Prunus plant, typically used as a cherry tree rootstock, botanically known as Prunus×gondouinii (Poit. & Turpin) Rehder (P. avium (L.) L.×P. cerasus L.), and hereinafter referred to by the name ‘STO1.’ The new and distinct cultivar of cherry rootstock of the present invention was bred as a cross of Prunus cerasus with a wild Prunus sp. in Germany in 1989. It has been successfully asexually propagated by tissue culture since the first time in 2002. The purpose of the breeding program was to find better adapted cherry rootstocks. The new Prunus plant is better adapted on heat and aridity than other rootstocks with a slow vegetative growth. The breeder succeeded in creating a new cherry rootstock, which has a higher yield and influences the grafted variety positively in fertility. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Plants of the new Prunus have not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary slightly with variations in environment such as temperature and light intensity, without any variance in genotype. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘STO1.’ These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘STO1,’ as a new and distinct cultivar of Prunus: 1. Upright plant habit;2. Good adaptation to hot and dry clime conditions;3. As a rootstock, with slow vegetative growth, it produces a dwarf tree;4. As a rootstock, imparts uniformity and higher yield to the grafted variety as compared to, for example, Gisela 5, F12/1 and Mazzard; and5. As a rootstock, grafted varieties have a 60% slower growth than a Prunus avium seedling; that is, the trees, for which ‘STO1’ is used as rootstock, grow more slowly and thus result in a dwarf tree that is smaller than, for example, a Prunus avium seedling. As used herein, “higher yield” refers to the impact of the rootstock of the tree on both vegetative as well as generative growth. Thus, the rootstock can affect the generative growth and assist the grafted species to achieve greater yield. Therefore, with regard to ‘STO1,’ the yield per tree and crown volume is higher than that of a standard rootstock such as Gisela 5, F12/1 and Mazzard. Further with ‘STO1’ as the rootstock, the grafted variety can achieve better fertility (i.e., greater generative growth). That is, use of ‘STO1’ as a rootstock results in greater generative growth than in the case of standard rootstock (Gisela 5, F12/1, Mazzard); the tree produces more flowers, more fruit, with a greater yield of the same or larger fruit size. In the end greater output is achieved. The parents of ‘STO1’ are Prunus avium and Prunus cerasus wild species (both unnamed and not patented). The Prunus cerasus parent is known for slower growth and much finer wood (a greater number of branches and thinner branches) than ‘STO1’. The Prunus avium-parent is known for stronger growth (i.e., faster growth) than ‘STO1,’ which results in much larger trees. Plants of the new Prunus,‘STO1,’ also can be compared to plants of Prunus ‘Weiroot 720’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 22,867, issued Jul. 24, 2012). In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Kressbronn, Germany, plants of the new Prunus differed primarily from plants of ‘Weiroot 720’ in the following characteristics: 1. As a rootstock, plants of the new Prunus have a one-third stronger vegetative growth (i.e., faster growth) than plants with ‘Weiroot 720’ rootstocks;2. Plants of the new Prunus develop stipules, whereas ‘Weiroot 720’ hasn't any stipules;3. Plants of the new Prunus produce larger fruit. Average fruit diameter ‘STO1’: 1.9 cm, ‘Weiroot 720’: 1.2 cm. Average fruit weight ‘STO1: 4 g, ‘Weiroot 720’: 1.6 g;4. Due to its typical/characteristic growth, plants of the new Prunus impart higher yield to the scion plant than plants of ‘Weiroot 720;’ and5. Fruits from plants of the new Prunus ripen about 10 days earlier than fruits from the ‘Weiroot 720.’ ‘STO1’ was first asexually propagated in 2002 in Freising, Germany, using tissue culture. Asexual reproduction of Prunus rootstock plant ‘STO1’ by tissue culture since 2002 has shown that the unique features of this new variety are stable and the plant reproduces true to type in succeeding generations of asexual reproduction. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The accompanying photographs illustrate the overall appearance of the new Prunus plant. These photographs show the colors as true as it is reasonably possible to obtain in colored reproductions of this type. Colors in the photographs may differ slightly from the color values cited in the detailed botanical description which accurately describe the colors of the new Prunus plant. FIG. 1 provides a side perspective view of a typical tree of ‘STO1’ grown in an outdoor orchard. FIG. 2 provides a close-up view of leaves of ‘STO1.’ FIG. 3 provides a close-up view of fruits, branches and leaves of ‘STO1’. DETAILED BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION The aforementioned photographs, following observations and measurements describe plants grown during the summer in Kessbronn, Germany in an outdoor orchard and under conditions and practices generally used in commercial cherry production. Plants were 11 years old when the photographs and descriptions were taken. Measurements and numerical values represent averages for typical plants and plant parts. The actual measurements of any individual plant or plant parts, or any group of plants or plant parts, of the new Prunus plant may vary from the stated average. In the following description, color references are made to The Royal Horticultural Society (R.H.S.) Colour Chart, except where general terms of ordinary dictionary significance are used. ‘STO1’ has a generally erect plant habit and is medium strong in growth. After eleven growing seasons in Kressbronn, Germany, a height of about 4.8 meters, a width of about 3.5 meters and a trunk diameter of about 14 cm were observed for ‘STO1 .’ The growth reduction induced by ‘STO1’ allows a highly intensive cherry production with dwarf trees.
