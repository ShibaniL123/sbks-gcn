BACKGROUND The present disclosure relates to a mop bucket with a platform. In particular, the present invention relates to a mop bucket with a platform which is effectively planar for squeezing a flat mop. Mops used for wet cleaning a floor typically include a long handle and a working head that has an absorbent material. The absorbent material may be in strips of material extending from the end of the long handle or the absorbent material may be a planar absorbent sponge material. To use either, the user will get the absorbent material wet, squeeze excess fluid from the absorbent material, wipe the wet absorbent material over the floor, flush clean the absorbent material, and repeat. For strip mops, the wringing element maybe a funnel shaped device slidably connected to the handle, or may be a dome shaped wringing basket, such as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,823,557 or U.S. Pat. No. 6,530,112. However, these dome shaped wringing baskets are only applicable for strip mops. For flat mops, the wringing element may be a slidable mechanism that is connected with the handle, that hinges and squeezes together opposing sides of the flat mop. This type of mop is commonly referred to as a butterfly mop. The mechanism used for a butterfly mop can be difficult to actuate and are prone to break. SUMMARY A mop bucket is disclosed that includes an effectively planar platform for allowing a user to squeeze excess fluid from a flat mop by pressing the flat mop against the working surface of the planar platform. In one embodiment, the mop bucket comprises a receptacle, a platform, and an access connection. The receptacle comprises a base and upward surrounding outer wall. The platform is raised from the base and entirely within the outer walls of the receptacle. The platform comprises a working surface that is opposite from the base of the receptacle. The access connection connects the working surface of the platform to the receptacle for fluid to pass from the platform into the receptacle. The platform is effectively planar, and the platform is inclined relative to the base. In one embodiment, the platform is raised from the base and supported by an inner wall. In one embodiment, the platform is raised from the base and supported around a perimeter of the surrounding outer wall. In one embodiment, the platform includes a plurality of raised portions, the peaks of which are effectively planar. In one embodiment, the raised portions are a plurality of discrete domes. In one embodiment, the raised portions are a plurality of linear ridges. In one embodiment, the planar platform is parallel with the base, which is planar. In one embodiment, the access connection comprises at least one passage on the platform to the receptacle. In one embodiment, the access connection comprises a gap between the platform and the surrounding outer wall. In one embodiment, the access connection comprises a gap between the platform and at least three of the surrounding outer walls. In one embodiment, the bucket further comprises a divider wall separating the receptacle from a second receptacle, which comprises a second base and a second surrounding outer wall. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment of a mop bucket; FIG. 2 is a perspective view of another embodiment of a mop bucket. While the above-identified drawings and figures set forth embodiments of the invention, other embodiments are also contemplated, as noted in the discussion. In all cases, this disclosure presents the invention by way of representation and not limitation. It should be understood that numerous other modifications and embodiments can be devised by those skilled in the art, which fall within the scope and spirit of this invention. The figures may not be drawn to scale. DETAILED DESCRIPTION FIG. 1 is a perspective view of one embodiment of a mop bucket 100. The mop bucket 100 comprises a receptacle 110, a platform 120, and an access connection 130. The receptacle 110 comprises a base 111 and projecting upward from the base 111 is a surrounding outer wall 112 so that the receptacle can hold fluid. In one embodiment, the surrounding outer wall 112 may be a single wall that is curved, oval, circular, such as in FIG. 2. In another embodiment, the surrounding outer wall 112 may comprise two or more outer walls 112, such as shown in FIG. 1. Opposite from the base 111, the surrounding outer wall 112 forms a perimeter 116. The platform 120 is raised from the base 111 so that fluid can be held in the receptacle 110 away from the platform 120. The platform 120 may be inclined relative to the base 111, to more easily allow for fluid to disperse. In one embodiment, the incline relative to the base 111 is at least 5 degrees. In one embodiment, the incline relative to the base is at least 20 degrees. In one embodiment, the incline relative to the base 111 is less than 60 degrees. In one embodiment, the incline relative to the base 111 is between 0 and 5 degrees. The platform 120 comprises a working surface 121 that is the surface of the platform 120 opposite the base 111. The working surface 121 is the surface that the mop is intended to contact for squeezing excess fluid from the mop. The working surface 121 may be planar or may comprise raised portion 126. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, a plurality of raise portions 126 are included on the working surface 121. The peaks of the raised portions 126 are themselves planar. The raised portions 126 provides for fluid to easily disperse away from the working surface 121 and into the receptacle 110. As shown these raised portions 126 are dome shaped. It is understood that any number of different sizes or shapes of raised portions may be includes, such a ridges, cones, or pyramids. The platform 120 may be permanently or removably connected with the receptacle 110 in a variety of ways. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the platform 120 is raised from the base 111 and supported by an inner wall 122. In one embodiment, such as shown in FIG. 1, several inner walls 122 extend from the base 111 to the platform 120, supporting the platform 120. In one embodiment, the platform 120 may be hingedly connected to the receptacle 110 to allow for open access into the entire receptable 110. The access connection 130 connects the working surface 121 of the platform 120 to the receptacle 110 for fluid to pass from the platform 120 into the receptacle 110. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the access connection 130 comprises a gap 132 that is formed between the platform 120 and the surrounding outer wall 112. The gap 132 may be between only a portion of the platform 120 and the surrounding outer wall 112 or may entirely surround the platform 120. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the gap 132 entirely surrounds the platform 120 to provide easy dispersment of fluid squeezed out of the mop and into the receptacle 110. In this embodiment, the mop bucket 100 further comprises a divider 140 that separates the receptacle 110 from a second receptacle 150. The second receptacle 150 comprises a second base 151 and second surrounding outer wall 152. Typically, in use, the second receptacle 150 will hold clean fluid and the receptacle 110 will hold the squeezed out, typically dirty fluid. As shown the mop bucket 100 includes a receptacle 110, platform 120, and second receptacle that are generally triangular shaped. It is understood that a variety of shapes and sizes may be use for the mop bucket 100. FIG. 2 is a perspective view of another embodiment of a mop bucket 200. Similar to the embodiment described in FIG. 1, mop bucket 200 comprises a receptacle 210, platform 220, access connection 230, and the optional second receptacle 250. In this FIG. 2, a mop 260 is shown that includes a handle 261 and an absorbent working head 262. The platform 220 is effectively planar and does not include raised portion. The mop bucket 200 in FIG. 2 includes a platform 220 that is raised from the base 211, but connects by engagement around an entirety of the perimeter 216 of the receptacle 210. The platform 220 is essentially flat, or parallel with the base 211. As shown the platform 220 covers the entire receptacle 210. Therefore, distinguishing the embodiment of FIG. 1 from the embodiment of FIG. 2, the access connection 230 comprises a passage 231 through the working surface 221 of the platform 220 to allow fluid to pass from the working surface 221 into the receptacle 210. The disclosed mop buckets provide an easy and effective means of squeezing excess fluid from a flat mop that comprises an absorbent, planar working head for cleaning floors. Instead of including complicated squeezing mechanisms on the mop, the planar surface and access connection of the bucket allow a user to easily apply pressure to the mop to squeeze excess fluid and collect the fluid in the receptacle.
