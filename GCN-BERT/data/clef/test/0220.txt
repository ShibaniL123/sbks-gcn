Methyl 2-bromo-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzoate (IV-35): To a stirred solution of methyl 2-amino-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzoate (IV-34, 3.6 g, 16.4 mmol) in CH3CN (22 mL) was added HBr (48% (aq), 20.3 mL) dropwise at 0° C. over 10 min. Then, NaNO2 (1.25 g, 18.1 mmol) in water (5 mL) was added dropwise over 1 h at 0° C. with vigorous stirring. After addition, the solution was stirred for 5 min at 0° C. followed by the addition of CuBr (2.71 g, 18.9 mmol) in portions over 30 min. The mixture was heated at 70° C. for 1 h then cooled again to 0° C. before being diluted with water (40 mL) and extraction with EtOAc (3×50 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with water (50 mL) and brine (50 mL), dried (Na2SO4), concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure, and chromatographed (ethyl acetate/hexanes, 1:9) to afford a clear oil (3.47 g, 75%).
