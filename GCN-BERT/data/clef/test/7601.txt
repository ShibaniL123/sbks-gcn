ALKOXY POLYCARBONATES, BISPHENOL MONOMERS AND METHODS OF MAKING AND USING THE SAME BACKGROUND [0001] Development of alternatives to existing polycarbonates, polyesters, and polyestercarbonates that maintain properties (high transparency and good melt stability) of the corresponding polymers are of great interest in the plastics industry and for the manufacturing industry. To achieve this, a suitable monomer for polymerization reactions is necessary to produce a polymer with the necessary properties. [0002] Further, monomers or oligomers used in making the polycarbonate materials may not proceed to completion in some instances, thus leading to the presence of unreacted residual monomers or oligomers in the polymeric material. Additionally, when subjected to certain conditions, the polymeric materials can undergo degradation reactions, such as hydrolytic or thermolytic degradation, resulting in the formation of hydrolysis and/or thermolysis degradants or reaction products. In some aspects, the resulting degradants can correspond chemically to the monomeric starting materials initially used to manufacture polymeric materials. The presence of residual monomers, either as residues of polymerization or through degradation by thermal or hydrolytic means, is an area of growing regulatory concern. [0003] This concern has led to extensive research to find suitable alternative monomers for polycarbonate materials whose residual monomers or degradation products exhibit desirable characteristics. Desirable characteristics of such degradants include, among other, extremely low, or even no estradiol binding activity. [0004] Accordingly, there is a need for polymeric materials which, if having or generating residual monomers, comprise such monomers that have very low, or non- detectable, biological activity, for instance having extremely low or no estradiol binding activity compared to estradiol in the estradiol related receptor (ERR). SUMMARY [0005] Disclosed herein are alkoxy polycarbonates, ortho-alkoxy bisphenol monomers, and methods of making the same. The method for making the ortho-alkoxy bisphenol monomers comprises: providing a phenol having at least one alkoxy substituent ortho to the hydroxyl group; providing a ketone; and reacting the phenol and ketone in the presence of a catalyst under conditions effective to provide a reaction product comprising an ortho-alkoxy bisphenol monomer; wherein the ortho-alkoxy bisphenol monomer does not exhibit a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) less than 0.00025M for alpha or beta in vitro estradiol receptors. The ortho-alkoxy bisphenol monomers can be used in the production of polycarbonate polymer compositions exhibiting properties such as low cost, high transparency and good melt stability. The resulting polymer compositions can be used in the manufacture of articles requiring materials with low cost, high transparency and good melt stability. These polycarbonate polymers when exposed to hydrolysis or thermal degradation may generate phenolic species which show very low or non-detectable interaction with biological systems for instance estradiol receptors. [0006] In another aspect, the invention relates to a method for preparing a bisphenol monomer, the method comprising: a) providing guaiacol; b) providing acetone; and c) reacting the guaiacol and acetone under conditions effective to provide a reaction product comprising 4,4' -(2,2'-isopropylidene)-bis(o-methoxy)phenol (PBMP); wherein the PBMP does not exhibit a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) less than 0.00025M for alpha or beta in vitro estradiol receptors. [0007] In various further aspects, the invention relates to polycarbonate polymers comprising the disclosed ortho-alkoxy bisphenol monomers. In some aspects, the invention provides a polycarbonate comprising: a) repeating carbonate units derived from at least one ortho-alkoxy bisphenol monomer; wherein the ortho-alkoxy bisphenol monomer does not exhibit a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) less than 0.00025M for alpha or beta in vitro estradiol receptors; and wherein when the polycarbonate is subjected to conditions effective to provide at least one hydrolysis product, the at least one hydrolysis product does not exhibit a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) less than 0.00025M for alpha or beta in vitro estradiol receptors. [0008] In various further aspects, the invention relates to a method for preparing a polycarbonate, the method comprising: a) providing a disclosed alkoxy bisphenol monomer; b) providing a carbonyl source reactant; and c) reacting the bisphenol monomer and carbonyl source reactant with a catalyst under conditions effective to provide a polycondensation reaction product comprising a polycarbonate; wherein when the polycarbonate provided in step c) is subjected to conditions effective to provide at least one hydrolysis product, each of the at least one hydrolysis products does not exhibit a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) less than 0.00025M for alpha or beta in vitro estradiol receptors.

Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Further, the singular forms "a," "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to "a polycarbonate polymer" includes mixtures of two or more polycarbonate polymers. The term "combination" is inclusive of blends, mixtures, alloys, reaction products, and the like. Ranges can be expressed as from one particular value to another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another aspect includes from the one particular value and/or to the other particular value. The endpoints of each of the ranges are significant both in relation to the other endpoint, and independently of the other endpoint. It is also understood that there are a number of values disclosed herein, and that each value is also herein disclosed as "about" that particular value in addition to the value itself. For example, if the value "10" is disclosed, then "about 10" is also disclosed. It is also understood that each unit between two particular units are also disclosed.

Polyarylates and polyester-carbonates or their blends can also be employed. Branched polycarbonates are also useful, as well as blends of linear polycarbonate and a branched polycarbonate. The branched polycarbonates can be prepared by adding a branching agent during polymerization. [0083] In a further aspect, the branching agents include polyfunctional organic compounds containing at least three functional groups selected from hydroxyl, carboxyl, carboxylic anhydride, haloformyl, and mixtures thereof.

The branching agents can be added at a level of from 0.05-2.0 weight percent. Branching agents and procedures for making branched polycarbonates are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,635,895 and 4,001,184. All types of polycarbonate end groups are contemplated as being useful in the thermoplastic composition, however, end groups derived from monomeric species with low biological activity, such as, for example, aliphatic alcohols, phenol, phenyl chloroformate, guaiacol (2-methoxy phenol), ortho-alkoxy phenols and mixture thereof are preferred. [0084] In a further aspect, the alkoxy polycarbonate can be a linear homopolymer derived from an ortho-alkoxy bisphenol, for example PBMP. The polycarbonates generally can have an intrinsic viscosity, as determined in chloroform at 25° C, of 0.3 to 1.5 deciliters per gram (dl/g), specifically 0.45 to 1.0 dl/g. The polycarbonates can have a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 10,000 to 100,000 g/mol, as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using a crosslinked styrene-divinyl benzene column, at a sample concentration of 1 milligram per milliliter, and as calibrated with polycarbonate standards. In a yet further aspect, the polycarbonate has an Mw of 15,000 to 55,000. In an even further aspect, the polycarbonate has an Mw of 18,000 to 40,000. [0085] In a further aspect, an alkoxy polycarbonate component used in the present invention can have a melt volume flow rate (often abbreviated MVR) measures the rate of extrusion of a thermoplastics through an orifice at a prescribed temperature and load. Alkoxy polycarbonates useful for the formation of articles can have an MVR, measured at 300° C. under a load of 1.2 kg according to ASTM D1238-04 or ISO 1133, of 0.5 to 80 cubic centimeters per 10 minutes (cc/10 min). In a still further aspect, the alkoxy polycarbonate, can have a MVR of 45 to 75 cc/10 min, specifically 50 to 70 cc/10 min, and more specifically 55 to 65 cc/10 min at 300 °C with a 1.2 Kg load. [0086] Alkoxy polycarbonates can comprise copolymers comprising carbonate units and other types of polymer units, including ester units, and combinations comprising at least one of homopolycarbonates and copolycarbonates. An exemplary polycarbonate copolymer of this type is a polyester carbonate, also known as a polyester-polycarbonate or polyester carbonate. Such copolymers further contain carbonate units derived from oligomeric ester- containing dihydroxy compounds (also referred to herein as hydroxy end-capped oligomeric acrylate esters). [0087] In various further aspects, "alkoxy polycarbonates" as used herein further include homopolycarbonates, copolymers comprising different R1 moieties in the carbonate (referred to herein as "copolycarbonates"), copolymers comprising carbonate units and other types of polymer units, such as ester units, polysiloxane units, and combinations comprising at least one of homopolycarbonates and copolycarbonates. [0088] In further aspects, the alkoxy polycarbonate has a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 110 to 145 °C, specifically 115 to 145 °C, more specifically 120 to 145°C, more specifically 120 to 139 °C, and still more specifically 120 to 139 °C. [0089] In some aspects, the alkoxy polycarbonate polymers and compositions can be manufactured by processes such as interfacial polymerization and melt polymerization. Generally, in the melt polymerization process, polycarbonates are prepared by co-reacting, in a molten state, alkoxy bisphenol and other optional commoners, such as isosorbide, aliphatic diol and/or aliphatic diacid, and any additional dihydroxy compound, and a diaryl carbonate ester, such as diphenyl carbonate, or more specifically in an aspect, an activated carbonate such as bis(methyl salicyl)carbonate, in the presence of a transesterification catalyst. The reaction can be carried out in typical polymerization equipment, such as one or more continuously stirred reactors (CSTRs), plug flow reactors, wire wetting fall polymerizers, free fall polymerizers, wiped film polymerizers, single or twin screw extruders, or combinations of the foregoing. In some aspects, volatile monohydric phenol can be removed from the molten reactants by distillation and the polymer is isolated as a molten residue. [0090] The conditions effective to provide the polycondensation reaction product typically comprise the presence of a polymerization catalyst. The catalyst can include a transesterification catalyst comprising a first catalyst, (an "alpha catalyst") comprising a metal cation and an anion, for example a cation such as Li, Na, K, Cs, Rb, Mg, Ca, Ba, Sr, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. The anion can be hydroxide (OH ), superoxide (O '), thiolate (HS~), sulfide (S '), a Ci_2o alkoxide, a C6-2o aryloxide, a Ci_2o carboxylate, a phosphate including biphosphate, a Ci_2o phosphonate, a sulfate including bisulfate, sulfites including bisulfites and metabisulfites, a Ci_2o sulfonate, a carbonate including bicarbonate, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. Exemplary alpha catalysts include lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, cesium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, barium hydroxide, lithium formate, sodium formate, potassium formate, cesium formate, lithium acetate, sodium acetate, potassium acetate, lithium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, lithium methoxide, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, lithium ethoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, lithium phenoxide, sodium phenoxide, potassium phenoxide, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, NaH2P03, NaH2P04, Na2H2P03, KH2P04, CsH2P04, Cs2H2P04, Na2S03, Na2S2C"5, sodium mesylate, potassium mesylate, sodium tosylate, potassium tosylate, magnesium disodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA magnesium disodium salt) It will be understood that the foregoing list is exemplary and should not be considered as limited thereto. In some aspects, the transesterification catalyst is an alpha catalyst comprising sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, NaH2P04, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. The amount of alpha catalyst can vary widely according to the conditions of the melt polymerization, and can be 0.001 to 500 μιηοΐ. In an aspect, the amount of alpha catalyst can be 0.01 to 20 μιηοΐ, specifically 0.1 to 10 μιηοΐ, more specifically 0.5 to 9 μιηοΐ, and still more specifically 1 to 7 μιηοΐ, per mole of aliphatic diol and any other dihydroxy compound present in the melt polymerization. [0091] In another aspect, a second transesterification catalyst, (a "beta catalyst), can optionally be included. Beta catalysts are typically volatile and degrade at elevated temperatures, and are therefore preferred for use at early low-temperature polymerization stages. Exemplary beta catalysts can include catalysts of formula (R 3 )4Q X, wherein each R 3 is the same or different, and is a C1-10 alkyl group; Q is a nitrogen or phosphorus atom; and X is a halogen atom or a Ci_8 alkoxy group or C6-i8 aryloxy group. Exemplary phase transfer catalyst salts include, for example, [CH3(CH2)3]4NX, [CH3(CH2)3]4PX, [CH3(CH2)5]4NX, [CH3(CH2)6]4NX, [CH3(CH2)4]4NX, CH3[CH3(CH2)3]3NX, and CH3[CH3(CH2)2]3NX, wherein X is CI", Br", a Ci_8 alkoxy group or a C6-18 aryloxy group. Examples of such beta catalysts include tetrabutylammonium hydroxide, methyltributylammonium hydroxide, tetrabutylammonium acetate, tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide, tetrabutylphosphonium acetate, tetrabutylphosphonium phenolate, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. The amount of beta catalyst (e.g., organic ammonium or phosphonium salts) can be 1 x 10"2 to 1 x 10"5, specifically 1 x 10"3 to 1 x 10"4 moles per total mole of the dihydroxy compounds in the reaction mixture. Quenching of the catalysts and any reactive catalysts residues with an acidic compound after polymerization is completed can also be useful in some melt polymerization processes. Among the many quenchers that can be used are alkyl sulfonic esters of the formula R 8 S03R 9 wherein R 8 is hydrogen, CrC12 alkyl, C6-Ci8 aryl, or C7-C19 alkylaryl, and R9 is CrC12 alkyl, C6-Ci8 aryl, or C7-C19 alkylaryl (e.g., benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, methylbenzene sulfonate, ethylbenzene sulfonate, n- butyl benzenesulfonate, octyl benzenesulfonate and phenyl benzenesulfonate, methyl p- toluenesulfonate, ethyl p-toluenesulfonate, n-butyl p-toluene sulfonate, octyl p- toluenesulfonate and phenyl p-toluenesulfonate, in particular alkyl tosylates such as n-butyl tosylate.). In further aspects, any alpha or beta catalyst, or mixture thereof, should be free of any monomer that could have estradiol binding at least less than or equal to 2.5xE-4M. In other instances any thermal or hydrolytic decomposition product from the alpha or beta catalyst, or mixture thereof, should also show no estradiol binding at least less than or equal to 2.5x E-4 M. [0092] In some aspects, an endcapping agent (also referred to as a chain stopper) can optionally be used to limit molecular weight growth rate, and so control molecular weight in the alkoxy polycarbonate. In various aspects, many conventionally known end capping agents exhibit undesirably high levels of estradiol binding activity. In contrast, however, suitable end capping agents or chain stoppers for use with the present invention exhibit estradiol binding activity levels similar or even identical to that of the selected aromatic dihydroxy monomers. More specifically, the endcapping agents suitable for use in the present invention also do not exhibit an IC50 less than 0.00025M for alpha or beta in vitro estradiol receptors. As such, a degradation product of the selected chain stopper will likewise not exhibit an IC50 less than 0.00025M for alpha or beta in vitro estradiol receptors. In further aspects, exemplary chain stoppers include certain mono-phenolic compounds, phenyl chloroformate, and the like. In still further aspects, a suitable chain stopper for use in the present invention is phenol, phenyl chloroformate, or guaiacol (2-methoxyphenol), or a combination thereof. Thus, when phenol is included as a chain stopper, the resulting polycarbonate comprises phenol as an end cap to the polymer chain. It should be understood however that the polycarbonates disclosed herein can be produced having any desired molecular weight (Mw) with any end cap providing the end cap has an IC50 less than 0.00025M for alpha or beta in vitro estradiol receptors. In a further aspect, end groups derived from monomeric specifies with low biological activity, for example; aliphatic alcohols, phenol, phenyl chloroformate, guaiacol (2-methoxy phenol), ortho-alkoxy phenols and mixtures thereof are preferred. [0093] In some aspects, the melt polymerization reaction can be conducted by subjecting the reaction mixture to a series of temperature-pressure-time protocols. In some aspects, this involves gradually raising the reaction temperature in stages while gradually lowering the pressure in stages. In some aspects, the pressure is reduced from atmospheric pressure at the start of the reaction to 1 millibar (100 Pa) or lower, or in another aspect to 0.1 millibar (10 Pa) or lower in several steps as the reaction approaches completion. The temperature can be varied in a stepwise fashion beginning at a temperature of the melting temperature of the reaction mixture and subsequently increased to final temperature. In some aspects, the reaction mixture is heated from room temperature to 150 °C. In such an aspect, the polymerization reaction starts at a temperature of 150 °C to 220 °C. In another aspect, the polymerization temperature can be up to 220 °C. In other aspects, the polymerization reaction can then be increased to 250 °C and then optionally further increased to a temperature of 320 °C, and all sub ranges there between. In some aspects, the total reaction time can be from 30 minutes to 200 minutes and all sub ranges there between. This procedure will generally ensure that the reactants react to give polycarbonates with the desired molecular weight, glass transition temperature, and physical properties. The reaction proceeds to build the polycarbonate chain with production of ester-substituted alcohol by-product such as methyl salicylate. In some aspects, efficient removal of the by-product can be achieved by different techniques such as reducing the pressure. Generally the pressure starts relatively high in the beginning of the reaction and is lowered progressively throughout the reaction and temperature is raised throughout the reaction. [0094] In some aspects, the progress of the reaction can be monitored by measuring the melt viscosity or the weight average molecular weight of the reaction mixture using techniques known in the art such as gel permeation chromatography. These properties can be measured by taking discrete samples or can be measured on-line. After the desired melt viscosity and/or molecular weight is reached, the final polycarbonate product can be isolated from the reactor in a solid or molten form. It will be appreciated by a person skilled in the art, that the method of making an alkoxy polycarbonate and alkoxy copolycarbonates as described in the preceding sections can be made in a batch or a continuous process and the process disclosed herein is preferably carried out in a solvent free mode. Reactors chosen should ideally be self-cleaning and should minimize any "hot spots." However, vented extruders similar to those that are commercially available can be used. [0095] Alkoxy polycarbonates, including alkoxy polyester-polycarbonates, can be also be manufactured by interfacial polymerization. Although the reaction conditions for interfacial polymerization can vary, an exemplary process generally involves dissolving or dispersing a dihydric phenol reactant in aqueous KOH or NaOH, adding the resulting mixture to a suitable water-immiscible solvent medium, and contacting the reactants with a carbonate precursor in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst, under controlled pH conditions, e.g., 8 to 10. The most commonly used water immiscible solvents include methylene chloride, 1,2- dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, toluene, and the like. [0096] Carbonate precursors include, for example, a carbonyl halide such as carbonyl bromide or carbonyl chloride, or a haloformate such as a bishaloformates of a dihydric phenol (e.g., the bischloroformates of bisphenol A, hydroquinone, or the like) or a glycol (e.g., the bishaloformate of ethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, polyethylene glycol, or the like). Combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing types of carbonate precursors can also be used. In an exemplary aspect, an interfacial polymerization reaction to form carbonate linkages uses phosgene as a carbonate precursor, and is referred to as a phosgenation reaction. [0097] The phase transfer catalysts can be of formula (R3)4Q+X as described above, or a tri(Ci to C alkyl) amine such as triethyl amine (TEA). An effective amount of a phase transfer catalyst can be 0.1 to 10 wt , preferably 0.5 to 2 wt , based on the weight of bisphenol in the phosgenation mixture. [0098] In various aspects, the alkoxy polycarbonate comprises at least one alkoxy polycarbonate polymer, wherein the alkoxy polycarbonate polymer can be a homopolymer, a copolymer, or combinations thereof. In a further aspect, the alkoxy polycarbonate comprises two or more alkoxy polycarbonate polymers. In a still further aspect, the alkoxy polycarbonate comprises three or more alkoxy polycarbonate polymers. In a yet further aspect, the alkoxy polycarbonate is a blend of at least two alkoxy polycarbonate polymers. [0099] In a further aspect, the alkoxy polycarbonate is a homopolymer. In a still further aspect, the polycarbonate is a homopolymer comprising repeating units derived from 4,4'- (2,2'-isopropylidene)-bis(o-methoxy)phenol (PBMP). [00100] In a further aspect, the alkoxy polycarbonate is a copolymer. In a still further aspect, the alkoxy polycarbonate is a copolymer comprising repeating units derived from PBMP. In yet a further aspect, the alkoxy polycarbonate is a copolymer comprising repeating units derived from sebacic acid. In an even further aspect, the alkoxy polycarbonate is a copolymer comprising repeating units derived from sebacic acid and PBMP. [00101] In a further aspect, an alkoxy polycarbonate is disclosed wherein the repeating carbonate units are derived from PBMP as aromatic dihydroxy monomers. In a still further aspect, the resulting alkoxy polycarbonate structure is shown below, wherein "n" can be any desired integer based upon the desired chain len th for the polycarbonate [00102] In a further aspect, the alkoxy polycarbonate has a weight average molecular weight from 15,000 to 50,000 grams/mole, as measured by gel permeation chromatography using BPA polycarbonate standards.

EXAMPLES [00211] The following examples are put forth so as to provide those of ordinary skill in the art with a complete disclosure and description of how the compounds, compositions, articles, devices and/or methods claimed herein are made and evaluated, and are intended to be purely exemplary and are not intended to limit the disclosure. Efforts have been made to ensure accuracy with respect to numbers (e.g., amounts, temperature, etc.), but some errors and deviations should be accounted for. Unless indicated otherwise, parts are parts by weight, temperature is in °C or is at ambient temperature, and pressure is at or near atmospheric. Unless indicated otherwise, percentages referring to composition are in terms of wt . [00212] There are numerous variations and combinations of reaction conditions, e.g., component concentrations, desired solvents, solvent mixtures, temperatures, pressures, and other reaction ranges and conditions that can be used to optimize the product purity and yield obtained from the described process. Only reasonable experimentation will be required to optimize such process conditions. [00213] All materials and reagents were used as received from the supplier unless otherwise indicated. [00214] HPLC was performed using Agilent 1100 Series auto injector instrument having PDA detector, water- acetonitrile as mobile phase, and measured at 240 nm. [00215] 1H and 13C NMR analyses were performed using Bruker 300 MHz instrument to record Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectral measurements with a solution of monomer or polymer in deuterated chloroform (CDC13) or mixture of deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6). SYNTHESIS OF PBMP [00216] Example 1: 3 eq. Guaiacol was reacted with 1 eq. of acetone in presence of 10 wt of concentrated H2SO4 (relative to the total amount of phenol and ketone ) and 600- 1300 ppm (based on total reactant content) of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) at 80 C for 5-6 hours, yielding a mixture of PBMP, cyclic, and isomeric products (Ratio 50: 10:40). [00217] Example 2: 3 eq Guaiacol was reacted with 1 eq of acetone in presence of 5 wt of an ion exchange resin (IER) catalyst (relative to the total amount of phenol and ketone ) and 600-1300 ppm (based on total reactant content) of 3-mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) at 80 C for 5-12 hours, yielding a mixture of PBMP, cyclic, isomeric products, and starting materials (Ratio 10:5:5:80). [00218] Example 3:3 eq. Guaiacol was reacted with 1 eq. of acetone in presence of 0.3 wt of dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (DBSA) catalyst (relative to the total amount of phenol and ketone) and 600-1300 ppm (based on total reactant content) of 3- mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) at 80 C for 12 hours, yielding a mixture of PBMP, cyclic, isomeric products, and starting materials (Ratio 10:5:5:80). [00219] Example 4:6 eq. Guaiacol was reacted with 1 eq. of acetone in presence of 30 wt concentrated HC1 ((relative to the total amount of phenol and ketone ) and 600-1300 ppm (based on total reactant content) of 3-Mercaptopropionic acid (3-MPA) at 90 C for 5-6 hours, yielding a mixture of PBMP and isomeric products (95:5). The crude product was then treated with aqueous 10 wt NaOH solution (e.g., pH 12-14) for 30 min to convert PBMP to its sodium salt. The formed sodium salt of PBMP was then filtered, washed with organic solvent to remove residual guaiacol and other impurities. The sodium salt of PBMP was dissolved in deionized water and the pH was adjusted to 2-3 using dilute HC1, followed by subsequent extraction with ethyl acetate and evaporation of ethylacetate layer, to obtain highly pure PBMP (>99 ), substantially free of isomeric and cyclic products. The product formation was confirmed by proton NMR (Fig. 1) and purity by HPLC (Fig. 2). Biological Testing [00220] Estradiol binding activity of various compounds and potential polymer hydrolysis or thermolysis products were tested using a conventional in vitro competitive binding assay, and quantified by the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value. In some aspects, PBMP according to the present invention is capable for use as component starting materials in the manufacture of alkoxy polycarbonate compositions. In a further aspect, component starting materials can mimic or replicate various chemical species that can be produced under certain conditions, for example high pH (8 to 12) or low pH (1 to 6), as hydrolytic degradation products derived from alkoxy polycarbonates comprising the component starting materials. The (IC50) binding concentrations for the alpha (a) and/or beta 1 (βΐ) in vitro estradiol receptors were tested. Tests were conducted by displacement of radiolabeled 17b-estradiol. [00221] The compound to be evaluated, for example guaiacol bisphenol, was tested as to its binding affinity for recombinant human estradiol receptors (rhER) alpha (a) and/or beta 1 (βΐ) in vitro. 17P-estradiol (E2) was used a standard whose relative binding affinity was defined as 100%. Competitive binding assays were performed by incubating rhER alpha (a) and/or beta 1 (βΐ) with 10 nM [3H]estradiol (the radio ligand) in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations, 0.25 to 250,000 nM, of the PBMP test compounds (nM is nano molar). Each data point is the average of at least two assays. Compounds were diluted 10 fold in binding buffer and then 1:4 in the final assay mix. The final concentration of ethanol or DMSO in the assay well was 5%. The highest concentration of the PBMP was 2.5 x E-4 M (250,000 nM). The compound under evaluation was tested at seven concentrations over log increments. The lowest concentration was 2.5 x E-10 M (0.25 nM). The IC50 is the concentration of test compound at which 50% of the radio labeled estradiol was displaced from the estradiol receptor. [00222] The experimental (IC50) values are provided in the Table 1 below. As shown, many mono and bisphenols (EX. A-F) show an undesired high level of receptor binding. However, surprisingly, preferred phenolic compounds (EX. 1-2) utilized in the alkoxy polycarbonate compositions of the invention either did not show any detectable estradiol binding in these tests or, at a minimum, did not exhibit an (IC50) binding concentrations less than 2.5 x E-4 M. An entry of >2.5 x E-4 for compounds in Table 1 indicates that those compounds did not compete to the extent of 50% with radio labeled 17B-estradiol at the highest concentration (250,000 nM) tested. That is there was no estradiol displacement and hence no IC50 could be determined, the IC50, if there is displacement at all, is some value greater than 2.5 x E-4. Table 1. [00223] As shown in Fig. 3 (IC50 rhER (a) = alpha receptor binding) and Fig. 4 (IC50 rhER (βΐ = beta receptor binding), the PBMP monomer shows no estradiol binding activity, even at the highest concentration. That is, even at a concentration of 2.5 x E-4 M, there was no displacement of estradiol. The PBMP monomer utilized to prepare the alkoxy polycarbonate compositions of the invention either did not show any detectable estradiol binding in these tests or, at a minimum, did not exhibit an (IC50) binding concentrations less than 2.5 x E-4 M. Without wishing to be bound by a particular theory, it is believed that when polycarbonate produced from PBMP monomers is subjected to conditions effective to provide one or more degradation products, such as a hydrolysis or thermolysis product, each of the one or more degradation products does not displace estradiol even at a concentrations as high as 0.00025 M. In further aspects, when the polycarbonate produced from PBMP monomers is subjected to conditions effective to provide one or more degradation products, each of the one or more degradation products also does not exhibit a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) equal to or greater than 0.00025 M for alpha or beta in vitro estradiol receptors. Synthesis and Characterization of PBMP Polycarbonate Example 5: [00224] A polycarbonate comprising PBMP monomers was prepared following an interfacial polycarbonate synthesis. To a 2L flask equipped with mechanical agitation, condenser, and a caustic vent scrubber, was charged CH2C1? (500 n l), deionized water (300 ml) and 4,4*-(2-isopropylidene)bis[2-methoxyphenol (20.0g, 0.069 moles, CAS# 64170-83- 8 ), Mixing was started and phosgene (10 g, 0.10 moles) was added subsurface at a rate of 1.0 g/minutes while a 33 wt% solution of sodium hydroxide was added at a rate to maintain pH = 7. After phosgene addition was complete, additional 33 wt sodium hydroxide solution was added to reach pH = 9 to 10 and the batch was purged with nitrogen for 10 minutes, p- Cumylphenol (0.37 g, 0.0017 mol) was added and the reaction mixture stirred for 10 minutes. Triethylamine (TEA) catalyst (0.29 ml) was then added and the batch stirred for an additional 10 minutes. Additional phosgene (4g, 0.04 mole) was added subsurface at a rate of Ig/min while 33 wt% sodium hydroxide was added to maintain pH = 9. The batch was purged with nitrogen for 10 minutes. Stirring was stopped and the batch allowed to phase separate. The organic phase containing polymer was separated, washed with IN HC1 (1x500 ml) and then with deionized water (3x500 ml). The polymer solution was then slowly fed into approximately 2L of hot water with rapid stirring to boil off the CH2CI2, and the resulting white polymer powder was isolated by filtration and dried in air at 60°C overnight. The PBMP polycarbonate polymer had a dry chloride content of 21 ppm. GPC of the polymer powder Mw = 23,393 and Mn = 6,600 vs. PC standard. Glass transition temperature (Tg) as measured by DSC was 126 °C. Tg was determined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with a 20 °C/min. heating rate and recoded on second heat in accordance with ASTM D7426. The Tg of over 120 °C indicates that the PBMP-PC polymer will have good practical use in many applications, for example, involving exposure to boiling water or autoclave sterilization. One gram of the dry polymer powder was extracted with approximately 10 ml. acetonitrile (CH3CN) and analyzed by liquid chromatography. The polymer had less than 100 ppm residual 4,4'-(2-isopropylidene)bis[2-methoxyphenol] (G-bisphenol) monomer. 1H- NMR analysis was carried out on the resulting PBMP polycarbonate polymer and the data are shown in Fig. 8. CDCI3 was used as solvent. Chemical shifts are consistent with the expected PBMP polycarbonate structure (Figs. 5A & 5B). 13 C-NMR analysis was carried out on the resulting PBMP alkoxy bisphenol acetone polycarbonate polymer in CDCI3 solution the data are shown in Fig. 6. Chemical shifts are consistent with the expected PBMP polycarbonate structure. Infra-red (IR) spectrum of a solution of the polycarbonate is shown in Fig. 7 and is also consistent with the alkoxy bisphenol acetone polycarbonate structure. [00225] The PBMP polycarbonate was used to prepare cast films by dissolving approximately 3 gm. of PBMP-PC in 30 ml methylene chloride. Solvent was evaporated overnight at room temperature and films were dried for 3 hr. at approximately 80 °C [00226] A cast film sample was analyzed by GPC (CH2C12, calibrated against BPA PC standards) which showed weight average molecular weight Mw = 23111. Properties and Testing of PBMP Polycarbonate [00227] Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was done under nitrogen or air from 40 to 800 °C at a rate of 20 °C/ min. PBMP-PC (Guaiacol-PC) and standard BPA-PC samples were tested to determine the onset and maximum weight loss under nitrogen and air by thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA). TGA data for the samples tested are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 8. The samples show an early loss of weight under 175 °C likely due to residual solvent from the film casting. The max rate of wt. loss for the guaiacol PC, while not as high as BPA-PC, is still above 430 °C. The 10% wt. loss does not occur until over 400 °C. Table 2. [00228] The PBMP-PC alkoxy polycarbonate shows high heat capability with a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 126 °C, and thermal stability was shown by less than 10 % TGA weight loss below 390 °C in either air or nitrogen. [00229] Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) spectroscopy analysis was carried out on the PBMP polycarbonate polymer (Fig. 9) and a standard BPA polycarbonate polymer (Fig. 7). The IR spectra data for both samples are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 9. Spectra were taken in solution of 0.1 g polymer in 50 ml methylene chloride. The data show both samples exhibit very similar absorption in the visible range. Cast PBMP-PC film showed a high transparency (> 80% T), low color (Yellowness Index < 10) and low haze (< 5% H). Table 3. [00230] Hydrolytic stability was performed by subjecting samples to hydrolytic stress by exposing the cast films to approximately 110 °C steam for 0-11 days. Steam was generated from deionized water with no additives. Hydrolytic stability was assessed for PBMP-PC, standard BPA-PC, BPA- PC with 0.03% tris (2,4 di-t-butyl phenyl) phosphite samples by comparison of the weight average molecular weight ("Mw") of polycarbonate polymer before and after hydrolytic stress as described above. The data were converted to percent retention of the initial Mw and the data are shown in Table 4. The PBMP-PC (Guaiacol-PC) showed good retention of molecular weight (Mw) on exposure to steam showing only a moderate rate of hydrolysis with 79% Mw retention after 11 days and retention of film integrity. [00231] Mn and Mw were determined using data obtained by standard chromatographic procedures. Briefly, GPC was carried out by first dissolving the sample at 1 mg/ml concentration in dichloromethane. The sample was then analyzed by GPC using a Polymer Laboratories MiniMIX C column (Polymer Laboratories, a division of Varian, Inc., Amherst, Massachusetts) with a mobile phase of dichloromethane and a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Detection wavelength was 254 nm. Mw results were reported against polycarbonate standards. Table 4. [00232] The PBMP-PC shows good clarity, low color, practical heat resistance (126 °C Tg), resistance to hydrolysis under exposure to steam with a composition that does not exhibit a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) less than 0.00025M for alpha or beta in vitro estradiol receptors. 1.
