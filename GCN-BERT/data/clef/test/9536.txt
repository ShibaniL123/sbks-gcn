Method B (Wittig Cyclization)
Example 5: (+)-6-fluoro-8-[(1R*,2R*)-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl]-2-{[1-(methylsulfonyl)piperidin-4-yl]amino}pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one
Example 6: (−)-6-fluoro-8-[(1R*,2R*)-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl]-2-{[1-(methylsulfonyl)piperidin-4-yl]amino}pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one
To a cooled (−70° C.) solution of ethyl (diethoxyphosphoryl)(fluoro)acetate (407 μL, 2 mmol) in THF (15 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere was added dropwise n-BuLi (1.6 M in hexanes, 1.9 mL, 3 mmol), then the mixture was stirred at −70° C. for 40 min. To this solution was added a solution of (±)-4-{[(1R*,2R*)-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl]amino}-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrimidine-5-carbaldehyde (Intermediate 1, 267 mg, 1 mmol) in THF (5 mL). The mixture was stirred and allowed to warm gradually to room temperature overnight. The solution was then cooled in an ice-water bath, EtOH (2 mL) was added, followed by sat. aq NaHCO3 (10 mL) and EtOAc (80 mL). The layers were separated, the organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate, concentrated to dryness, and the residue purified by silica gel chromatography (eluting with 40% heptane/60% EtOAc) to give (±)-6-fluoro-8-[(1R*,2R*)-2-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentyl]-2-(methylsulfanyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7(8H)-one (5A, 218 mg, 71%).
