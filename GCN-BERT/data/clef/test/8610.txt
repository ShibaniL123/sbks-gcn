“Hermetic connector, pierceable without needle and automatically and sealingly reclosable, for devices intended for collecting and dispensing liquid solutions for pharmaceutical and/or nutritional use”. >fs îjî îjî The present invention relates to a hermetic connector, pierceable without needle and automatically and sealingly reclosable, for devices intended for collecting and dispensing liquid solutions for pharmaceutical and/or nutritional use. In all medical devices intended for dispensing liquid solutions for pharmaceutical and/or nutritional use, the connections between the various parts to be connected for different purposes, such as introduction and collection of liquids, creation of circulation circuits etc., are of fundamental importance. In particular, containing bags of liquid solutions for pharmaceutical and/or nutritional use, from which flexible tubes usable for introducing additional substances and/or for collecting the solution contained in the bag extend, are known. Such flexible tubes are closed by hermetically sealed connectors, which should additionally be pierceable for introduction and collection purposes and then hermetically reclosable at the end of the operation. In particular, connectors for the aforesaid use which comprise a thermoplastic body are known, which connectors can be pierced with the needle of a syringe. Connectors which do not require a needle because they are closed by a plastic body which can slide in a closing body to establish the communication between a syringe attachment (Luer lock) or the like and the inside of the flexible tube are also known. Finally, connectors openable without needle are biown, for example from US 2008/093571, WO 95/15194 and US 5,268,771, which connectors are provided with a closing plug formed by a deformable plastic body, longitudinally crossed by a slot in which a syringe hier is inser table to determine the provisional opening of an elastically deformable check valve, which then closes automatically when the hier retracts after the introduction or collection operation. All these known solutions have problems which include, respectively, the need for a syringe with needle, which may lead to accidental injuries, the lack of hermetic closing before use, the imperfect sealed closing after the first opening operation, the relatively high cost, and more, In view of the prior art, the present invention has the purpose of making a connector which starting from a hermetic closing state may be pierced without a needle to execute an operation for introducing and collecting the liquid and which may then sealingly reclose after the end of the operation. The present invention allows to reach such an object by means of a closing plug pierceable by pressing a needleless introduction/collection tang (such as the hier of a syringe), wherein the closing plug comprises a check valve with closing lips openable by introducing said tang and elastically reclosable after extracting the introduced tang, characterized in that said closing plug further comprises a pierceable and elastically sealingly closable membrane placed to hermetically close the inlet end of said check valve. By virtue of the present invention, important advantageous effects are obtained, such as the hermetic closing before use, the sealed safety reclosing after each introduction and extraction operation of the introduction/collection tang, the elimination of any back flow effect when the tang is extracted, the low cost, the absence of a needle. An embodiment of the present invention is shown by way of nonlimiting example in the appended drawings, wherein: figure 1 shows a connector according to the invention in axial section; figure 2 shows the closing plug of said connector seen from the top with respect to figure 1; figure 3 shows said closing plug seen from the bottom with respect to figure 1; figure 4 shows said closing plug in a section view taken along line IVIV in figure 1; figure 5 shows the inlet end of the connector in axial section completed with a protective removable cap; figure 6 shows a connector like the one in figure 1 and a syringe before their connector for perforating the closing plug of the connector; figure 7 shows in enlarged scale the connector and the syringe after connecting; figure 8 shows an axial section of the same connector after the disconnection of the syringe; figure 9 shows the connector in figure 8 in a top plan view; figures 10-13 show some methods of use of the connector according to the invention. The connector shown in figures 1-4, which is indicated as a whole with numeral 1, comprises a main body 2, preferably made of polypropylene carbonate crossed by an axial hole 3, The main body 2 consists of a collar 4 and an axial extension A polypropylene polycarbonate support 6 is fixed to the collar 4 for a closing plug 7 made of elastically deformable plastic material, in particular TPE SEBS polyisoprene silicone, and an annular band 8 is arranged and fixed about the support 6. The closing plug 7 includes a body 30 and a pair of gradually thinner side lips 9 between which a thin rectangular section slot 10 is made, preferably during the step of molding, which slot is open on the lower end and terminates on the top immediately before a thin hermetic closing membrane 1 1 made in one piece with the rest of the plug 7. It is worth noting that the sum of the length of the slot (10) and of the thickness of the membrane (1 1) is shorter than the length of a syringe luer. The two side lips 9 include concave external recesses 12, which extend laterally from the lower end of the same, starting from the slot 10. An upper collar 13 rests on the top of the support 6. If required, a protective plug 14 overhangs the support 6 and the closing plug 7, as shown in figure 5. Easily breakable attachment points hold the cap 14 in position inside the annular band 8 before the first use of the connector 1. The materials of its components are appropriately subjected to antimicrobic treatment in consideration of the expected use of the connector. In particular, the use of silver ions may be provided, which bind to the cellular wall and penetrate through the same, obstructing the duplication of cell DNA and inhibiting microbe respiration. Alternatively, the use of ionic plasma may be provided. Figure 6 shows a container 1 as the one in figures 1-4, free of the cap 14 and with the axial extension 5 engaged in a flexible tube 16 for introducing or collecting liquid into or from a containing device of the same. In such a condition, the membrane 11 hermetically closes the plug preventing any entrance or exiting of liquid through the axial hole 3. A syringe 17 with hier or connection tang 18 is ready for connecting to the tube 16 by means of the connector 1. The connection is carried out pressing the luer 18 against the top of the closing plug 7. In this manner, the luer 18 perforates the membrane 1 1 and inserted in the slot 10, moving away the two side lips 9 to reach the inlet of the axial hole 3, as shown in figure 7. Since, as mentioned, the overall axial height of the slot 10 and of the membrane 11 is shorter than the length of the luer of a syringe, the luer thus introduced allows the syringe 16 to operate in two-way manner thus allowing the introduction and the collection of liquid through the flexible tube 16. The syringe may also be of the type known as “Luer lock”, i.e. with male luer partially surrounded by an internally threaded coaxial external socket (indicated with a dashed line and with number 31 in figure 6). In this case, the insertion of the luer 1 8 occurs by screwing the external sleeve 3 1 of the syringe onto the support 6 of the plug 7, exploiting an external groove 32 of the support 6 for such purpose (figure 7). At the end of the operation, the luer 18 of the syringe may be extracted from the slot 10 of the closing plug 7, the side lips 9 of which close by elastic stress, reaching the position in figure 8, identical to the original position in figure 1. The membrane 1 1 also closes elastically, thus obtaining again the hermetic closing of the connector, as shown in figure 9, where the dashed-and-dotted line 19 symbolizes the recontact and closing point of the membrane. The concave shape of the external recesses 12 of the side lips 9 facilitates and forces the closing of the slot 10 and of the membrane 11, thus obtaining the function of check valve which prevents the existing of liquid from the flexible tube 16 during and after the extraction of the luer. Figures 10-13 show methods of use of the connector according to the invention. In particular, figure 10 shows its application to a flexible introduction/collection tube of a flexible bag 20 for containing liquid pharmaceutical and/or nutritional solutions and figure 11 shows the combination thereof with a fitting 21 for attaching the closing head of a vial 22 for liquid solutions or powders, Figure 12 shows the association of a connector according to the invention to an infusion tubing 23 with side attachment and figure 13 shows the association thereof to a fitting 24 for infusion devices 25 of various types. It is worth noting that the fitting 24 is of the type described in EP 1 004 329, i.e. made in two parts 26 and 27 rotational with respect to each other to allow the screw fixing of the fitting to the infusion device without needing to turn the part intended for the insertion of the luer of the syringe. 1.
