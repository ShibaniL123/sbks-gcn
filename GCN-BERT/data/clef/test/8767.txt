Step 2
The compound 8 (5.63 g, 34.1 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (56 mL). Tin chloride dihydrate (23.1 g, 102 mmol) was added to the solution. The mixture was stirred at 70Â°C for 1 hour. After cooled to room temperature, water and 2 mol/L aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide were added to the reaction mixture to adjust the pH to 7. The reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed by brine. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to give the crude product of the compound 9 (4.6 g, yield 98%).
