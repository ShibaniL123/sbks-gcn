IN THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE An International Patent Application for: DENTAL DEVICE COMPRISING SURGICAL TEMPLATE AND FALSE TEETH SET AND RELATED METHODS Invented By: Jason Watson and Ron Tsai Cross-Reference to Related Application [0001] The present application relies on the disclosure of and claims priority to and the benefit of the filing dates of U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 61/971,804, and 61/971,810, both filed on March 28, 2014, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/052,988, filed September 19, 2014, and U.S. Nonprovisional Application Nos. 14/670,380, and 14/670,383, both of which were filed on March 26, 2015, and the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by this reference. Technical Field [0002] The present invention relates to the field of dental surgery. More particularly, the present invention relates to a combination surgical template and false teeth set that fit together to form an implantable denture. The present invention also relates to methods for manufacturing a surgical dental template, methods for installing a denture prosthesis in a partially edentulous patient, and method for reducing jaw bone in a patient. Background Art [0003] The use of dental prostheses with dental implants secured in the upper or lower jawbone is well known in the art. Accurate placement of the implants within the jawbone is a difficult task. The dental surgeon typically has difficulty deciding on a drilling axis for the implants since the ideal position for the implants should be decided with knowledge of the jawbone structure into which the implant is to be inserted, and with knowledge of the position within the jawbone structure of the nerve tissue, the gum surface and the required position and dimensions of the false teeth or dentures to be supported by the dental implant. [0004] The conventional surgical procedure for installing one, implant-supported, prosthetic tooth includes drilling a properly positioned hole in the jawbone of the patient, inserting the implant in the hole, and attaching the prosthetic tooth to the implant. Proper implant positioning is also extremely important to ensure that the implant is anchored within sufficient bone structure in the patient's jawbone. [0005] The most common method for locating a dental implant hole is to visually survey the area and drill the hole in a freehand manner. However, this method can readily result in imperfect bores due to space limitations associated with working inside a patient's mouth. If the drilling axis is not properly chosen, the installed implants might cause damage to the tissues and muscle surrounding the area of implantation and subsequently cause temporary or permanent paresthesia. Furthermore, other problems can result from flawed or imperfect implant holes, such as uneven force distribution, insufficient bone growth around the implant, secondary infections, and ultimately, implant failure. [0006] During a one-stage surgical procedure, a healing abutment assists in the healing, formation, and maintenance of the soft tissue over the implant while bone integration occurs. The healing abutment is immediately placed into the implant well to ensure that the gum line will heal properly and look natural once the final abutment is tapped into the implant. [0007] During a two-stage surgical procedure, a cover screw is initially screwed into the implant well. The tissue surrounding the cover screw is then sutured to protect the implant site while bone integration occurs. Once the bone has integrated, an incision is made in the tissue above the site, at which time integration is checked. Once the bone has healed properly, the cover screw is then removed, and a healing abutment is screwed into the implant well. With the healing abutment securely in place the tissue surrounding the area is sutured. Approximately 4-6 weeks later, the healing abutment can be removed and a final abutment is then placed into the implant. In some surgical cases, a final abutment is immediately placed into the implant well rather than the healing abutment and sutures are not required. In both the one-stage and two- stage surgical procedure, the final abutment supports the final crown or denture. [0008] Many types of surgical guides are on the market today. They can be tooth supported, gum supported, or bone supported. The simplest guides are done in the laboratory. They consist of acrylic templates (or stents), or teeth, both filled with radiopaque markers that provide the position of the teeth in relation to the bone on 2D radiographs. Holes are drilled through these surgical guides at the selected implant sites and the surgeon uses them to make bone perforations. Afterwards, the surgeon needs to raise a flap in order to make the osteotomies. Examples of such guides are shown in FIGS. 1 and FIGS. 2A-2B. More sophisticated guides use computer tomography (CT)-scan data and special software in order to place the implants according to three-dimensional (3D) data. The guide is then fabricated using stereolithographic machines or milling machines. [0009] Each surgical stent commonly used is custom-built and these devices are only useful for a single patient, are costly to fabricate, and they require a number of intermediary office and laboratory steps to take an impression of the patient's arch and create a cast model from which the surgical stent is formed. [00010] Superstructures are used as load-bearing elements that interface prosthesis to implants. In the conventional method for the construction of superstructures, a physical model of the patient's gums and dental implant heads is prepared on which the superstructure is built manually using molding and other techniques known in the art. The craftsman or technician skilled at manufacturing such dental superstructures takes into consideration the size and shape of the desired dentures to be placed over the superstructure when crafting the same. The procedure for manufacturing dental implant superstructures as is conventionally known in the art is time-consuming and sometimes results in imperfect structures or defects in the visual appearance of the dentures to be placed over the superstructure. [0001 1] Therefore, in an effort to reduce costs and the number of steps associated with fabricating a traditional surgical stent, various forms of prefabricated surgical stents and positioning guide systems have been developed to aid the dental surgeon. In International patent application publication no. WO 94/26200, there is described an adjustable guiding device for positioning dental implants in which it is possible for the dental surgeon to adjust a drilling axis for each implant before proceeding to use the guiding device or drill template to guide the surgeon's drill for the purposes of preparing the drill hole for the implant. [00012] In U.S. Pat. No. 5,401, 170, there is disclosed a method and apparatus for measuring by camera image the implant heads of the implants in the patient's mouth for the purposes of cutting a frame on which the prosthetic teeth will be arranged and baked. In the method disclosed, the construction of the frame or superstructure is carried out in the absence of a reference to the shape and position of the patient's ideal tooth position. [00013] Thus, as the dentures or artificial teeth are crafted on the frame or superstructure, care would be required during the manual process to ensure that the position of the teeth on the frame will match the opposed set of teeth in the patient's mouth. [00014] It would thus be desirable to provide a drill guide system comprising components fabricated prior to the actual surgery that may be used more than once for the same patient, for any restoration configuration, and that enables precise implant spacing, and also ensures that the implant holes are drilled at the proper angle and orientation.

[00034] Another embodiment of the invention comprises a method for implanting or installing a denture prosthesis in a partially edentulous patient. The method may first comprise providing a surgical template and a false teeth set. The surgical template is configured to fit over the gum tissue of an edentulous jaw of a patient and has one or more sites for drilling osteotomies, and the surgical template and false teeth set are configured to fit together to form a denture prosthesis. The surgical template is then positioned over the gum tissue of an edentulous jaw of a patient at a first position and the false teeth may be inserted and set into the surgical template. The false teeth set may be fixed into the surgical template with a composite. The patient is then instructed to bite down on the false teeth set with natural teeth of the jaw opposite the edentulous jaw. The surgical template is repositioned, and the steps are repeated until the patient confirms occlusion between the natural teeth and false teeth set. The surgical template is finally fixed over the gum tissue of the patient's edentulous jaw at a second position. [00035] In embodiments, a wall of the surgical template is configured to form one or more pin holes, the surgical template comprising pins passing though each of the pin holes, and the pins are used to fix the surgical template over the gum tissue of the patient's edentulous jaw. [00036] In embodiments, the method further comprises drilling osteotomies into the edentulous jaw based on the drilling sites and installing implants at the osteotomies and securing the surgical template through the implants. The implants can be secured with a fastener. [00037] In embodiments, the surgical template and false teeth can be finished or converted to provide the appearance of a dental prosthesis by removing one or more of a boundary line between the surgical template and false teeth set, one or more pin holes in the surgical template, and one or more flanges in the surgical template. The boundary line and one or more pin holes can be removed by filling with composite. [00038] Another embodiment of the invention comprises a method for reducing jaw bone. A surgical template configured to fit the interior of a maxillary or mandibular j aw over an edentulous patient's gum tissue is installed in a patient. The surgical template has one or more sets of drill holes. Next, osteotomies may be perforated through the drill holes in the surgical template to define markings in the jaw bone forming a boundary for reducing bone. The surgical template is removed and the jaw bone is exposed though an incision to reveal the osteotomies. Finally, a surgical instrument is used to remove jaw bone based on the boundary formed by the markings. [00039] The device of the invention when implanted and converted to a denture prosthesis provides for the appearance of natural teeth while being fixed in the jaw, providing aesthetic benefits for an edentulous or partially edentulous patient. Further, the invention may provide for shorter surgery times for implantation of the device as well as greater precision in placement compared to conventional devices. In addition, the device may be converted to a temporary or final prosthesis. The device can be used with a variety of implants for implantation into jaw bone.

Modes for Carrying Out the Invetion [00086] Reference will now be made in detail to various exemplary embodiments of the invention. It is to be understood that the following discussion of exemplary embodiments is not intended as a limitation on the invention. Rather, the following discussion is provided to give the reader a more detailed understanding of certain aspects and features of the invention. [00087] In one embodiment, the present invention is a two-part denture prosthesis or device comprising a surgical template or guide and removable false teeth set for both the mandibular and maxillary jaw. The surgical template and false teeth set may be configured to fit together in an interlocking configuration. The surgical guide may exist as two components that are each configured to fit the top (maxilla) or bottom (mandible) portion of a patient's jaw when placed inside the mouth. The surgical guide may have one or more holes that may serve as drilling sites. The holes may be positioned so that osteotomies may be drilled downward in the mandible or upward in the maxilla. The holes in the guide can comprise a cylindrical wall (also known herein as a depth stop) that is raised or lowered to accommodate a target depth of the osteotomy. The surgical guide may have one or more pin holes for securing or clamping the guide to the jaw during surgery. During surgical placement of the guide, pins can be set through the pin holes in the guide through the bone to secure the guide in place until it is permanently fixed with the abutments or implants. In embodiments, the pin holes are located laterally on the guide and spaced apart to secure the sides and central portion of the guide. [00088] In embodiments, the surgical guide has a removable false teeth set configured to interlock with the surgical guide. The removable teeth may exist as two additional components (e.g., one for the maxillary jaw and one for the mandibular jaw) each configured to fit the top maxillary portion or bottom mandibular portion of the surgical guide. The removable false teeth set allows the oral surgical guide to be simultaneously used as a prosthesis. In addition, the removable false teeth are useful in helping to confirm the fit of the surgical guide through occlusion. The removable teeth may fit on the surgical guide above or below the drill holes and may have access holes that complementarily fit the drill holes. Ultimately, the surgical guide and teeth component are secured as one piece to the implant(s) placed in the jaw though a fastener such as screws. [00089] The surgical guide may be manufactured to fit the individual patient's mouth based on a CT scan of the maxilla and mandible. The surgical guide may be manufactured from a nanoceramic composite or other suitable material through CNC milling or 3D printing. [00090] In another embodiment, the invention is a method for performing oral surgery. The method comprises placing a surgical guide of the invention in a patient's mouth, setting one or more pins through the holes of the guide to secure the guide to the jaw, placing a set of teeth on the guide, instructing the patient to bite down on the teeth to confirm the fit of the guide through occlusion, if necessary, releasing the guide with the pins and readjusting the fit of the guide based on the occlusive bite, and securing the guide with the pins, drilling osteotomies through the holes, and securing the guide to the jaw through implants or abutments placed in the osteotomies. The methods may further comprise using a pre-surgical bite registration index based on the patient's bite. The methods may further comprise cutting off insertion pin holes and flanges on the guide and filling the border between the surgical guide and false teeth set with composite to provide for a natural look. [00091] In another embodiment, the invention is a method of placing a dental prosthesis in the mouth of a patient. The method comprises placing a surgical guide in the mouth of a patient, performing guided surgery based on drill holes in the surgical guide, inserting abutments through the surgical guide, retrieving the surgical guide and reducing excess material, inserting a complementary false teeth set into the surgical guide, drilling a guided screw channel into the surgical guide, and finishing the surgical guide. [00092] Various embodiments of a device of the invention are shown in FIGS. 3-18F. FIGS. 3A-3B show a manufactured/milled denture prosthesis 100 according to an embodiment of the invention. The denture prosthesis includes mandibular guide 105, mandibular false teeth set 1 12, maxillary guide 125, and maxillary false teeth set 1 18. Guides 105 and 125 include insertion pin holes 130 and insertion pins 128 as well as flanges 135A extending above the guides. Guides 105, 125 may have portions with the color, shape, and appearance of gum tissue. The insertion pins 128 may be used to pin the guide in position into the jaw bone based on results of the CT scan and holds the guide in place like a vise. The false teeth sets 112 and 118 are used as a reference for orientating the guides 105 and 125 into the jaw during placement. The guide is first preliminarily placed in the mouth based on the results of the CT scan, the teeth are placed in the guide, and the patient's mouth is closed to provide occlusion of the false teeth set with the natural teeth set on the opposite jaw. This method is also called canine guidance, in which occlusal contacts of the cuspids cause contacts of posterior teeth to separate in excursive mandibular movements. Occlusion confirms that the guide is in proper position. The false teeth sets 112 and 125 may be glued to the guides 105 and 125 during final preparation of the dental prosthesis. FIG. 3C shows that insertion pins 128 have a tapered portion 132 projecting inward through and beyond insertion holes 130 for insertion into the jaw. [00093] As will be shown below, the false teeth sets 1 12, 1 18 and guides 105, 125 may include features that allow corresponding components to fit into place. These may include at least one male component on the guides 105, 125 and at least one female component on the teeth or vice versa. In one embodiment, the guides 105, 125 have a male component having an appearance of a molar tooth structure that interlocks with a molar tooth structure of the corresponding false teeth sets 112, 1 18. In other embodiments, the guides 105, 125 have a ledge or gulley that is configured to accept a protruding portion of the corresponding false teeth sets 112, 118. Once they are fit together, false teeth sets 1 12, 118 and guides 105, 125 may be permanently fixed together through an adhesive such as a composite. [00094] FIG. 4 includes a surgical guide 105 and false teeth set 1 12 which includes line 1 10 at point of insertion of false teeth set 1 12 into surgical guide 105. Since the surgical guide 105 and false teeth set 112 will serve as a prosthesis, unnatural features such as insertion pin holes 130 and line 110 must be removed from the device during a conversion process. FIGS. 5 and 6A shows a surgical guide 105 and false teeth set 112 with line between them removed by filling with composite and insertion pin holes removed. The surgical guide 105 and false teeth set 112 shown in FIG. 5 is processed according to how it would appear in a patient. FIG. 6A shows the maxillary 118 and mandibular 112 false teeth sets together in occlusion. FIG. 6B is a photograph showing a bottom view of an embodiment of the surgical template converted to a final dental prosthesis showing towers 119 from multi-unit abutments. [00095] Turning now to FIG. 7, shown is a surgical guide 105 with separated false teeth set 1 12, which reveals drilling sites 120 on the surgical guide 105. The drilling sites 120 comprise a cylindrical hole which may be provided at different depths to help guide the depth of the drill hole. For example, a cylindrical hole may include a wall 121 at a specified height to prevent drilling too deep. These cylindrical hole configurations are also known as depth stops. As shown in FIGS. 8A-8C, the drilling sites 120 may be accessible through guided surgical drilling equipment 150, 155, which may drill osteotomies in the jaw for fixing the surgical guide 105 and false teeth set 112 into the jaw. Also shown in FIG. 8C are complementary holes 122 in the false teeth set which align with the drilling sites 120 which serve as screw access holes. [00096] Now referring to FIGS. 9A-9D, shown are a surgical guide and dental prosthesis device of the invention at different stages of assembly. FIG. 9A shows a mandibular surgical guide 105 with the removable false teeth set 1 12 removed, while FIG. 9B shows the mandibular surgical guide 105 with the removable false teeth set 1 12 attached. Also shown in FIGS. 7 and 9A are interlocking structure 147 and horseshoe-shaped ledge 153 for connecting false teeth set 112 to mandibular surgical guide 105. Such features may be used to fit the two components in place. FIGS. 9C and 9D show the surgical guide 105 with excess material removed, including the interior drilling sites 120A, flange 135B, and insertion pin holes 130 shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B. In embodiments, the excessive material reduction is a component of a Chair-Side Adaptation Workflow, which includes the following steps: [00097] 1. Guided surgery [00098] 2. Abutment (not shown) insertion and bonding, through surgical guide still installed [00099] 3. Surgical guide retrieval and excess material reduction [000100] 4. Surgical guide parts assembly and bonding [000101] 5. Guided screw channel drilling [000102] 6. Finishing [000103] In embodiments, the device of the invention may be used as a temporary prosthesis until a more permanent prosthesis is put into place. FIGS. 10A and 10B show the manufacture of a more permanent prosthesis based on the device. FIG. 1 OA is a photograph showing bars milled for final clone prosthesis according to an embodiment of the invention. FIG. 10B is a photograph showing bars embedded within a nanoceramic prosthesis according to an embodiment of the invention. The more permanent prosthesis may be implanted in the jaw through the implants installed through the surgical guide. [000104] FIGS. 11A-1 1C show a patient implanted with a surgical guide converted to a dental prosthesis according to an embodiment of the invention. As shown in FIGS. 1 IB and l lC, the maxillary 118 and mandibular 1 12 false teeth sets are positioned so that they are in perfect occlusion with canine guidance. [000105] In embodiments, the surgical guide may include one or more retaining pins and drill holes located on the denture which serve as a surgical guide for bone reduction. The bone reduction guide assists the user to reduce bone to the necessary thickness in order for the denture to be placed at the right height, and may be determined from a CT scan of the patient's jaw. The retaining pins and drill holes allow for a boundary on the jaw to be marked when the surgical guide is placed in the jaw as the jaw may be marked by drilling though the drill holes. When the guide is placed the jaw may be exposed through an open flap incision, allowing the oral surgeon to see the holes. The jaw may be reduced by sawing down the jaw until the holes are no longer visible. [000106] Now referring to FIG. 12, a partial denture prosthesis 200 comprising a surgical guide 205 with bone reduction guide according to an embodiment of the invention is shown. FIG. 12 shows three retaining pins 228 located in insertion pin holes 230 and two sets of four bore holes 260 located on surgical guide 205, which like previous embodiments has corresponding false teeth set 212. The bore holes 260 are drilled into the surgical guide 205, which provides a bone reduction guide for the device. It acts as a part of the same medical device. The bone reduction guide assists the user to reduce bone to the necessary thickness which may be 15-16 millimeters thick in order for the denture to be placed at the right height. The surgical guide will be stacked on the bone much like a LEGO toy set. The ridge width acts as a guide to remove the bone. The user will push through the tissue and make holes in the bone. Pins inserted into the tissue will be cut. The gum tissue will be opened up and the bone will be exposed. When this happens there will be holes in the bone. The bone will be grinded until the holes disappear at which point the bone will be leveled down along the peak of the mountain peak which is the front or anterior end of the jaw. The surgeon will remove bone along the holes. There will be depressions in the bone and the bone will be ground down until there is a flat plane. The osteotomy is CT driven and will use a denture wherein it will be filled with resin. A denture will be used to get inside of bone. It acts as a surgical guide, prosthesis, and denture guide. [000107] FIGS. 13 and 14 show a partial denture prosthesis embodiment 300 according to the invention. Partial denture 300 includes surgical guide 305 and removable false teeth set 312. When teeth 312 are removed they reveal drill holes 320 which are accessed by drilling equipment. FIGS. 15A and 15B show before after photographs of a patient surgically implanted with the partial denture 300. In embodiments, the partial denture comprises a false teeth set having anywhere from 2 to 8 teeth. [000108] As shown in FIGS. 13 and 14, a surgical guide or template 305 is configured to fit over the gum tissue of a partially edentulous jaw missing one or more incisors. The surgical template 305 has one or more openings 320 each providing a channel for drilling an osteotomy into the maxillary or mandibular jaw at the site of the missing incisors. Included are one or more removable false teeth 312 configured to fit the surgical template at each opening 320. As shown in FIGS. 14, 15A, and 15B, the surgical template and one or more removable false teeth provide a partial or complete bridge between the left and right cuspids when implanted into a patient's jaw. In embodiments, the surgical template is configured to partially wrap around the left and right cuspids to secure it to the jaw. [000109] FIGS. 16-17 are CAD drawings showing the surgical guide of the invention is fully compatible with the BIOHORIZONS® Guided Surgery Kit according to an embodiment of the invention. FIGS. 16-17 show guide 405 with insertion pins 428 and insertion pin holes 430, and drilling holes 420 which are accessible by drilling equipment 450, 455. Features of the surgical guide include anchoring using the CGS-FP Fixation pins, secure tool assembly using the embedded pilot drill sleeves or yellow, green and blue Master Cylinders, site preparation using the GGS-YTP/GTP/BTP Tissue Punches, guided osteotomy using BIOHORIZONS® Drill Guides and Drills, all displayed during design to prevent interference with adjacent geometry, guided insertion using the BIOHORIZONS" Implant Drivers and Depth Stops.

[0001 17] FIG. 19A is a CAD drawing showing an example of BIOHORIZONS® implants according to an embodiment of the invention. FIG. 19B is a CAD drawing showing an example of BIOHORIZONS® multiunit abutments according to an embodiment of the invention. These are examples of implants and abutments that can be used to secure the surgical template of the invention to the jaw. However, the device of the invention is compatible with a variety of implants such that the surgical template may be considered a universal guide. [0001 18] In another embodiment, the present invention is a method of creating a two-part dental prosthesis comprising a surgical guide and false teeth set. The method comprises performing a CT scan on a patient, transferring the scan (such as in the form of a Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) file) into treatment planning software. The CT scan slices implant or anchor sites by size and diameter per zone into the jaw bone. From the CT scan, a surgical guide is created based on one or more anchor or implant sites to create a surgical template. The surgical guide may be created by a trained biomedical engineer or oral surgeon who virtually places the implants in position on the CT scan, taking into account the bone quality and quantity and the presence of nerves. The surgical guide is then milled based on the template that provides one or more holes that may serve as drilling sites to place the implants which secure the guide into the jawbone. The drilling sites are created so that the implants are placed at consistent angles to provide for an even pressure distribution on the surgical guide when it is secured in the jaw. A treatment protocol may also be produced from the treatment planning software which instructs a dental surgeon how to place the surgical guide, including the drilling depth. Based on the CT scan, sites in the jaw bone may be identified that may be used to secure one or more implants. The implants may provide a means for securing the device in place with a fastener such as a screw. The device may be attached to the jaw through the implants according to the implant manufacturer's instructions. [0001 19] In embodiments, the CT scan may be performed in a variety of ways, depending on whether the jaw is fully or partially edentulous and whether metal restorations or amalgams are present. For a partially edentulous jaw, if there is good teeth support, and no metal restorations or amalgams, then the CT scan may be performed without a radiographic guide. If there is good teeth support and amalgams or metal restorations are present, then the CT scan may be performed with a radiographic guide. For a partially edentulous jaw without good teeth support or for a fully edentulous jaw, the CT scan may be performed with a gum-supported surgical guide (denture with markers). [000120] FIG. 20 is a screenshot showing an example of a scanning protocol verification checklist according to an embodiment of the invention, illustrating different scanning protocols that can be used to create the surgical guides. The checklist includes the following separate protocols: Single-Scan Protocol for Teeth- Supported Surgical Guide, Dual Scan Protocol for Teeth-Supported Surgical Guide, and Dual Scan Protocol for Gum-Supported Surgical Guide. The Single Scan Protocol can be used if there are no metal restorations or amalgams. The Dual Scan Protocol for Teeth- Supported Surgical Guide can be used only if there is good tooth support, and the Dual Scan Protocol for Gum-Supported Surgical Guide can be used for the gum-supported surgical guide. Further, the Single Scan protocol can be used without any radiographic guide, the Dual Scan Protocol for Teeth-Supported Surgical Guide is used with a radiographic guide, and the Dual Scan Protocol for Gum-Supported Surgical Guide is used with a denture with markers. [000121] FIG. 21 is a CAD drawing showing the placement of implants according to an embodiment of the invention. [000122] FIG. 22 is a screenshot of a Treatment Planning Report Overview supplied for case analysis according to an embodiment of the invention. The Treatment Planning Report Overview includes results of the CT scan of the whole jaw (top) as well as slices of the individual anchor or implant sites (bottom). The CT scan slices zones for each of the implant sites. If this step if not performed, the implants may be placed at divergent angles, and too much pressure may be placed on the implants and they may ultimately fail. The guide must be oriented so that the implants are not coming down through the teeth or the gums. They should be parallel and in best position in concert with the bone such that everything lines up. Based on the results of the Treatment Planning Report Overview, a Planning Report for each implant site is provided, an example of which is shown in FIG. 23. [000123] FIG. 24 is a screenshot showing guided surgery information for a patient according to an embodiment of the invention. The surgical guide information may be developed from the CT scans shown previously. The surgical guide information includes a Complete Guided Surgery Protocol including drill selection and handles for preplanned osteotomy position. The surgical guide information includes general practitioner information, case information, and implant information including sites, implant dimensions, surgical kit, drill working length, and special notes. [000124] FIG. 25 is a screenshot showing a treatment planning approval form according to an embodiment of the invention. The approval form includes information such as doctor information, case information, and approval method. [000125] FIG. 26A is a photograph of a guided surgery kit according to an embodiment of the invention. It is an example of the type of guided surgery tools that can be used to drill osteotomies through the drill sites of the surgical guide. [000126] FIG. 26B is a photograph showing fast healing using the guided surgery method embodiments of the invention. The photographs show the implants placed according to the methods of the invention. [000127] FIG. 27 is a decision tree to support the appropriate scanning protocol according to an embodiment of the invention. The decision tree determines which scanning protocol of FIG. 20 to use. For a partially edentulous jaw, if there is good teeth support, and no metal restorations or amalgams, then the CT scan may be performed without a radiographic guide, and a single scan protocol may be used. If there is good teeth support and amalgams or metal restorations are present, then the CT scan may be performed with a radiographic guide and a dual scan protocol may be used. For a partially edentulous jaw without good teeth support or for a fully edentulous jaw, the CT scan may be performed with a gum-supported surgical guide (denture with markers), and a dual scan protocol for a sum-supported surgical guide may be used.
