TITLE OF INVENTION Apparatus, system, and method for a dynamic rotational electrochemical reactor CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This Application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/946,843, filed March 2, 2014 and U.S. Non-Provisional Application No. 14/632,267, filed February 26, 2015. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates generally to the field of electrochemical reactors, systems, and processes for treatment of liquids and gases. More specifically the invention comprises a dynamic rotational electrochemical reactor, system and process, which can be used as, but not limited to, a rotational electrochemical coagulation-reactor or a rotational electrochemical-oxidation reactor. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] Commercial electrochemical reactor technology has been in existence since the early 1900's. The conventional electrochemical reactor design is a static reactor with electrode-plates placed in a vessel. In such reactors, a fluid, i.e., liquid or gas, is placed in the vessel so that the fluid contacts the reactor-electrode plates so that an electrolytic reaction in the electro-chemical-coagulation reactor "oxidizes" the metal of one of the reactor electrodes while producing oxides, hydrogen gas and OH- groups on the opposite reactor electrode. In an electro-chemical oxidation reactor, the electrolytic process of oxidation and reduction reactions generally produces various kinds of oxidants and hydroxyl radicals in the reactor. [0004] It is common knowledge that hydraulic functionality mass-transfer efficiency has great influence on the process and results of electrolytic and electrochemical reactions in static reactors. Insufficient mass-transfer efficiency is principally caused by hydraulic limitations, which are imposed by the boundary layer onto this process. [0005] The electrolytic process takes place inside this boundary layer, on the reactor electrode surfaces and the interface between the liquid and the reactor electrode surfaces. This boundary layer is a static layer, which is formed by liquid flowing over a static plate. On the electrode surface there is zero liquid velocity. The thickness of this boundary layer in the reactor is dependent on the design of the reactor and the flow velocity of the liquid through the reactor. The lower the flow is through the reactor, the lower the velocity and the Reynolds's number, which results in a thicker boundary layer. The thicker the boundary layer is, the more it negatively affects the efficiency of the electrochemical reactor. [0006] The thickness of the boundary layer limits the application of the electrolytic reagents and electrochemical reaction to the remainder of the liquid in the bulk volume of the electrochemical reactor. The static nature of the boundary layer limits any mixing of the electrochemical reactions and the electrolytic-reagents produced in the boundary layer with the bulk volume of the reactor. This is commonly measured as the mass transfer efficiency of the reactor. [0007] Existing electrochemical reactor technology lacks high mass transfer efficiency due to the thickness of boundary layer and poor electrolytic performance. The ions and gases become trapped in the thick boundary layers, which significantly reduces mass transfer efficiency. The passivation of electrodes, due to buildup of successive layers of blocking films of high molecular weight unreactive materials in the boundary layer, decreases the rate of reaction until eventually the reaction completely stops. Moreover, during use of existing electrochemical reactors, metal ions from the electrodes become dissolved in the fluid and, when the polarity is reversed, an enormous violent reaction results. This violent reaction cannot be controlled in conventional reactors. Further, existing technologies fail to provide means for controlling the contact time between the electrodes. In addition, the use of sacrificial plates in existing reactors leads to decreased efficiency and increased maintenance. Existing technologies are also not modular and scalable so as to be customizable to particular applications. Capacities of conventional static reactors are dependent on the residence time (dwell-time) of the liquid in the reactor, where after full coagulation takes place, residual non-coagulated materials, or excess metals are part of the out-flow of the reactor. Typically, gases cannot be treated because the reactor is static and so gas-flow cannot be controlled in a static reactor, e.g., light gases always flow to the top, while heavier gases remain on the bottom of the reactor. [0008] The reactor and process according to aspects of this invention are fundamentally different from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art in that they provide, among other things, a dynamic process having means to significantly increase the mass transfer efficiency by shrinking the boundary layer and providing means to control the contact time and the throughput. The invention can use durable electrodes, effecting high shear rates, and being modular, scalable and highly portable. [0009] As such, considering the foregoing, it may be appreciated that there continues to be a need for novel and improved devices and methods for electrochemical reactors. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [00010] The foregoing needs are met, to a great extent, by the present invention, wherein in aspects of this invention, enhancements are provided to the existing models of electrochemical reactors. [00011] In various aspects, the invention relates to a dynamic rotational electrochemical reactor apparatus for liquid or gas applications, a system for dynamic rotational electrochemical reactions, and a process for using the reactor apparatus. The reactor apparatus may be a dynamic rotational electrochemical-coagulation-reactor or a dynamic rotational electrochemical-oxidation reactor, or a combination thereof. [00012] According to aspects of the present invention, an electrochemical reactor apparatus includes a reactor vessel constructed from one or more inert materials, such as injection molded plastics. The vessel has a top end and a bottom end, and includes a fluid inlet and a fluid outlet. A rotatable reactor body may be arranged in the reactor vessel preferably along a central axis of the reactor vessel. An inlet turbine may be arranged at the bottom of the reactor body in fluid connection with the fluid inlet of the reactor vessel. The reactor body may be attached to a drive shaft or other rotating means, which may be arranged centrally and extend vertically within the reactor vessel. The reactor body may include a plate-stack comprising electrode plates arranged to maximize flow thereto and to also drive the water with pumping action as it is rotated. A voltage source is provided to the electrodes. The apparatus may also include a gas vent for venting gases created during oxidation. [00013] According to aspects of the present invention, a dynamic electrochemical process for treatment of fluids may include providing an electrochemical reactor apparatus includes a reactor vessel having a reactor body according to aspects of the present invention, conveying fluid into the reactor vessel through a fluid inlet of the vessel, pressurizing the reactor body via rotation of an inlet turbine that may be arranged at the bottom of the reactor vessel in fluid connection with the fluid inlet, applying electric current to the reactor body which may include a rotating plate-stack comprising electrode plates arranged to maximize flow thereto and to also drive the water with pumping action as it is rotated, reacting fluid with electrode plates so as to treat the fluid while allowing control of the velocity of rotation of the reactor body as well as the electric current supplied to the reactor body. The fluid may be moved through the reactor body to react with the electrode plates through channels formed by gaps between the electrode plates and into a space between the reactor body and the reactor vessel and thereafter expelled from the reactor vessel. Electric current may be supplied to the reactor body. The electric current may be controlled and reversed during the dynamic electrocoagulation process to yield high efficiency electrocoagulation. In some embodiments, the dynamic electrochemical process may include treating the fluid by electro-coagulation, electro-oxidation or both. [00014] According to aspects of the invention, a reactor is housed either in a vessel filled with a to-be treated liquid or gas or used submerged in the to-be treated liquid or gas. The reactor may include a plurality of electrode plates, which have a fixed position in relation to each other in a plate-stack. The plate-stack of electrode plates rotate inside the vessel filled with the to-be treated liquid or gas. The plate-stack is designed in such a way that at least a portion of each of the plates is angled in the direction of the plate discharge. [00015] Aspects of the invention provide the ability to adjust the rotational speed of the reactor, allowing for essentially infinite and dynamic variability in mixing rates and reaction times. As such, the apparatus, system and process may enable the user to vary the residence time of the electrochemical reaction onto the liquid or gas in the reactor vessel, resulting in full control over the electrochemical process and an overall improvement of efficiency and mass transfer of the reactor. The reactor apparatus may include a fluid intake turbine at the bottom of the reactor device, and pumps for pumping the to-be treated liquid or gas into the reactor. The placement and design of the reactor plates in the reactor device act as a Tesla pump, allowing the fluid to be transported through the cylindrical gaps between the reactor plates. [00016] Unlike many conventional electrochemical reactors, the electrodes are not arranged vertically within the reactor body. Unlike conventional electrochemical reactors, the electrodes are not static electrodes that remain motionless during use. [00017] There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, certain embodiments of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof herein may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are, of course, additional embodiments of the invention that will be described below and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto.

[00019] As such, those skilled in the art will appreciate that the conception upon which this disclosure is based may readily be utilized as a basis for the designing of other structures, methods and systems for carrying out the several purposes of the present invention. It is important, therefore, that the claims be regarded as including such equivalent constructions insofar as they do not depart from the spirit and scope of the present invention.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION [00028] Before describing the invention in detail, it should be observed that the present invention resides primarily in a novel and non-obvious combination of elements and process steps. So as not to obscure the disclosure with details that will readily be apparent to those skilled in the art, certain conventional elements and steps have been presented with lesser detail, while the drawings and specification describe in greater detail other elements and steps pertinent to understanding the invention. [00029] The following embodiments are not intended to define limits as to the structure or method of the invention, but only to provide exemplary constructions. The embodiments are permissive rather than mandatory and illustrative rather than exhaustive. [00030] It should be understood that the embodiments of the present invention are not limited to the precise arrangements and configurations shown. Although the design and use of various embodiments are discussed in detail below, it should be appreciated that the present invention provides many inventive concepts that may be embodied in a wide variety of contexts. The specific aspects and embodiments discussed herein are merely illustrative of ways to make and use the invention. It would be impossible or impractical to include all of the possible embodiments and contexts of the invention in this disclosure. Upon reading this disclosure, many alternative embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art. [00031] The present electrochemical reactor apparatus, system and method provide means for treating fluids. Embodiments of the invention can be used to remove, e.g., suspended solids, break emulsions, and eradicate contaminants without the use of filters or chemical additives. Electro-coagulation (EC) and electro-oxidation (EO) according to embodiments of this invention have advantages compared to other processes, such as filtration or chemical coagulation, because these processes do not increase the salinity of the fluid, do not require high pressures or temperatures, do not require chemicals, produce significantly less sludge (e.g., hydroxides, minerals), have greater activity and remove a wider range of pollutants. The apparatus, system and method can remove contaminants that are impossible to remove by other means. [00032] In a conventional electro-coagulative process, a molecule/particle in solution is flocculated and separated from the water as a contaminant, which may include heavy metals, dyes, oils, fats, solvents, salts, etc. Various embodiments of the present invention have the unexpected result of keeping flocculation minimal and under control, while more efficiently treating fluids due to the dynamic design features and capabilities of the invention. [00033] The invention is useful for any process or application that requires treating fluids containing contaminants. Exemplary industries in which the invention may be used include, but are not limited to, paper and pulp production, oil and gas drilling, extraction and recovery, hydraulic fracturing, mining, metal processing, pesticides, semiconductor industry, e.g., for removing silica, geothermal industry, removing boron from seawater to produce drinking water, treating sewage, removing toxic H2S gas from sewage lifting stations, removing ferric chlorides, removing phosphates to prevent algae blooms, biofuel industry, pharmaceutical industry, producing antibiotics, removing radioactive materials, fluids containing foodstuff waste, oil wastes, dyes, marinas, public transit, wash water, ink, suspended particles, chemical and mechanical polishing waste, organic matter from landfill leachates, defluorination of water, synthetic detergent effluents, and fluids containing heavy metals. [00034] In one embodiment, wastewater is treated to produce clear, palatable, and odorless water and to remove insoluble, colloidal, particulate forms of inorganic and organic contaminants. [00035] According to embodiments of the present invention, the present invention relates to a rotatable reactor disposed in a vessel, whereby the fluid is pumped by both a pump mechanism, like an impeller, and, in part, by the reactor itself. Channels are formed by gaps between electrodes, which are set at least partially on an angle to move the fluid in a controlled manner over the electrodes for efficient reactions therewith, but also to allow for effective evacuation of gaseous and treated fluid that are products of the electrolytic oxidation process. The reactor is generally symmetric to allow for sets or pairs of electrodes. The dynamic and rotational reactor body is operable to minimize the boundary layer on the electrodes, thereby increasing efficiency and providing control of the reactions to the user. [00036] According to embodiments of the present invention, the present invention relates to a process for treating fluids, i.e., liquids or gases, with a rotatable reactor disposed in a vessel. In certain embodiments, the process may include pumping fluid into and through a reactor body of the vessel by pump mechanism and/or by rotating the reactor body itself. The process may include using the reactor body as a Tesla pump. The dynamic process of controlling the flow of the fluid through the reactor vessel and the reactor body allows for efficient electrochemical reactions such as electro-coagulation and/or electro-oxidation to occur. [00037] In some embodiments, by moving the fluid in a controlled manner over the electrodes and through channels formed by gaps between the electrodes, the process results in efficient electrochemical reactions where the boundary layers of the electrodes are minimized, while also allowing for effective evacuation of gaseous and treated fluid that are products of the electrolytic oxidation process. In certain embodiments, the process may include pressurizing the reactor by rotation of the pump mechanism to convey fluid into the reactor vessel. In some embodiments, the process may include using a voltage source to apply electric current to electrodes and reacting the fluid with the charged electrodes. In some embodiments, the process may include controlling a velocity of rotation of the dynamic reactor body, so as to move fluid through channels formed by gaps between the electrodes and out of the reactor body through the channels. [00038] In certain embodiments, the invention includes a cylindrical reactor vessel constructed from tubular plastic materials, having an inlet and outlet. In one embodiment, an additional inlet and outlet for forced ventilation are provided. In another embodiment, one or more outlets are provided for gases, which release gas when the vessel is pressurized. In certain embodiments, a pump is provided in fluid communication with the fluid inlet to pump the to-be treated liquid or gas into the inlet of the reactor vessel. In another embodiment, a pump is not provided in fluid communication with the fluid inlet. [00039] The dynamic electrochemical reactor apparatus may include a reactor body positioned in the reactor vessel, e.g., a cylindrical reactor vessel, along the central axes of the reactor vessel connected to a drive shaft, which is placed in the center of the reactor vessel. The reactor body can be rotated inside the reactor along the central axes of the vessel by means of a motor, for example an electric motor that drives the shaft. In some embodiments, the speed can be controlled by a transmission or a variable frequency converter. [00040] In certain embodiments, the to-be treated fluid enters from the reactor vessel via an inlet. The fluid from the inlet can be forced into the central chamber of the reactor body. The to-be treated liquid or gas can enter the gaps between the bottom and top electrode plates as well as the intermediate electrode plates. In certain embodiments, the forced hydraulic movement can be arranged to move fluid into the reactor channels. In some embodiments, the rotational speed of the reactor body can be arranged to induce an acceleration of fluid movement towards the exterior edge of the electrode plates. In some embodiments, the rotational velocity can be controlled and the acceleration of the velocity can be controlled. [00041] The rotation of the reactor body reduces and controls the thickness of the boundary layer on the electrode plates allowing for a precise control of the electrolytic process on the electrode surfaces. Embodiments of the present invention can include control of the electrolytic process by means of control of the residence time of fluid inside the reactor vessel and the reactor body. Embodiments allow for a precise control of the coagulation and/or oxidation processes, which will occur in the reactor vessel and the reactor body and the formation, and size of coagulated and/or oxidized contaminants in the to-be treated fluid. [00042] Precise control of the formation and size of coagulated and/or oxidized components in the to-be treated fluid allows for accurate and controlled separation of the coagulated and/or oxidized components during post treatment processes. [00043] Referring to FIG. 1, a rotational electrochemical reactor 100 according to example embodiments of the present invention is shown. The reactor includes a reactor vessel 105 that houses an electrochemical reactor body 108. A voltage source or power supply 120 (e.g., DC power supply) provides electric current to the electrochemical reactor through a rotational contactor 101. The reactor vessel 105 includes a fluid inlet port 109 and fluid outlet port 107. Fluid may be pumped into or otherwise allowed to flow into the vessel 105 through the inlet port 109 and is discharged via outlet port 107. [00044] In one embodiment, the fluid needing treatment may be treated in a single pass through the reactor vessel 105. In another embodiment, a feedback loop can be provided so that the fluid is recycled back into the reactor vessel 105 again through the inlet port 109 for additional treatment(s). For example, fluid outlet 107 may be connected to fluid inlet 109 by a recycle conduit, e.g., a pipe or flow path (not shown). In some embodiments, multi-pass treatment of the fluid is used. [00045] In an embodiment, a pre-filtration screen 112 can be attached to the fluid inlet 109. [00046] To-be treated fluid is subjected to an electrochemical reaction in the electrochemical reactor body 108. The electrochemical reactor body 108 is rotated in the reactor vessel 105 at rotational speed by means of a drive shaft 102 housed in the isolation shaft 103, around the central axis of the reactor vessel 105. A drive motor 510, as shown in FIG. 5, which can be an electric motor, can be coupled to the drive shaft for rotating the shaft, for example as shown via a belt drive 512, whereby the reactor is rotated. A controller (not shown) may be provided for controlling the speed of rotation of the reactor body. [00047] A skilled person will understand that the components of the reactor must be properly sealed. The rotational electrochemical reactor 100 can include a vessel-top mechanical shaft seal 103, which surrounds and seals the drive shaft 102. A bottom shaft bearing 110 can surround the drive shaft 102 at the bottom end of the dynamic electrochemical reactor 100. [00048] During operation, fluid enters the electrochemical reactor body 108 from the reactor vessel 105. Liquid or gas will leave the electrochemical reactor body 108 from gaps in the side of the electrochemical reactor body 108 into a narrow cylindrical space (also interchangeably referred to as an annulus herein) 111 which is located between the reactor vessel 105 and the electrochemical reactor body 108. As such, the reactor vessel 105 and the electrochemical reactor body 108 have a defined container design for controlled flow of the fluid over the electrodes and to the outlet to achieve homogenous treatment, contact time, shear rates and fluid pumping, which results in partial flow through the reactor and controlled electrochemistry. Conventional reactors have undefined containers such that the contact time and flow of the fluid cannot be controlled. As a result, in conventional reactors, some fluid is treated for too long a period of time and some fluid passes too quickly through the reactor to the outlet without sufficient contact time. However, unlike conventional reactors, embodiments of the present invention are designed to function as a pump such that the rate of fluid flow can be carefully controlled. In contrast, conventional reactors are mixers in which the flow of fluid over the electrodes cannot be controlled. [00049] Conventional reactors may include contact brushes, which introduce electrical noise in to the electrical stream. Embodiments of the present invention may avoid the disadvantages of existing reactors by not including contact brushes. [00050] In a related embodiment, the electrochemical reactor body 108 is designed and configured to function as a Tesla pump during its rotational movement in the fluid in the reactor vessel 105, wherein rotating electrode plates function as spinning discs of a Tesla pump. The Tesla pump action of the electrochemical reactor body 108 operates to force liquid or gas entering through the fluid inlet 109 up through the electrochemical reactor body 108 in which the fluid undergoes electrochemical treatment and then out of the electrochemical reactor body 108 via its side-gaps into the annulus 111 between the electrochemical reactor body 108 and the reactor vessel 105. [00051] Once in the narrow cylindrical space / annulus 111, the electrochemically treated fluid is then discharged from the reactor vessel 105 through the fluid outlet 107. Any gases produced in the reactor vessel 105 are evacuated through ventilation outlets 104. Forced ventilation may be provided through a ventilation inlet 106. In some embodiments, forced ventilation can be provided using a forced ventilation blower 114, which may be attached to the ventilation inlet 106. [00052] FIG.2 illustrates a cross-section along the plane A-A of the electrochemical reactor body shown in FIG. 1 as reference number 108. As shown, a plate-stack 260, comprising electrode plates 233, 234 and 236 are positioned in the electrochemical reactor body 108 and separated by pre-determined distances. The distance between each set of electrode plates can be uniform. The electrode plates 233 234 236 are supported by plastic support plates 232 235 237. A top sealing gasket 231 may be provided to form a seal above the top plastic support plate 232. [00053] Channels 243 are formed by the gaps between the parallel electrode plates 233, 234 and 236. Fluid flows through the reactor body fluid inlet in fluid connection with a fluid inlet turbine wheel or impeller 224 over the end electrode plates 233 and 236 and intermediate electrode plates 234 to the annulus discharge channel shown in FIG. 1 as reference numeral 111 between the electrochemical reactor body 108 and the reactor vessel 105. The fluid inlet turbine wheel 224 pressurizes the central chamber 244 of the reactor body. The difference in the centrifugal force created by the greater circumference of the outside and the rotation of the electrode plates 233, 234 and 236 pumps the to-be treated fluid out through the channels 243 and into the annulus 111 shown in FIG. 1. [00054] Electric current is applied to the electrochemical reactor and can be controlled by a user. In one embodiment, DC (direct current) is used to effect the electrochemical reaction in the electrochemical reactor. DC is supplied from a power supply 120 to the rotational electrochemical reactor 100 using a rotational contactor 101. Positive and negative leads 201 from the voltage source or power supply 120 may be connected to the static part of the rotational contactor 101 such that each electrical contact fulfills the duty of positive or negative supply to the reactor. The internal insulated electrical connection wires 202, also referred to as the insulated wires 202, can be connected to the dynamic part (bottom part) of the rotational contactor 101 and are passed through the drive shaft 102 to the positive electric contact 228 and the negative electric contact 227. The negative pole of the DC current is then transferred via conductive structural and electric conductive stud 268 via the bottom electric metal contact bushing 263 to the bottom current distributor 222 to the bottom electrode metal contact plate 239 and to the metal inter-electrode conductive springs 241 to the bottom metal electrode plates 236. In one embodiment, the conductive studs 218 268 are constructed from a conductive metal. In certain embodiments, the conductive studs 218 268 can be constructed using stainless steel and/or aluminum. The bottom electrode metal contact plate 239 is arranged above the plastic bottom connection piece 221. In one embodiment, the bottom electrode metal contact plate 239 may be arranged inside and/or flush to the plastic bottom connection piece 221. The bottom connection piece 221 is secured by bottom structural outer ring plastic acorn nuts with structural studs and isolation tubes 240. [00055] The positive pole of the DC current is transferred via the conductive structural and electric conductive stud 218, then via the top electric metal contact bushing 219 to the top current distributor 220, then to the top metal electric contact plate 230, and via the metal inter-electrode conductive springs 241 to the top metal electrode plates or the top electrode plate 233. Each electric conductive stud 218 and metal contact bushing 219 can be provided with an isolation bushing at the opposite side of the metal contact bushing 219. [00056] The reactor is designed such that electrochemical reactions take place while the reactor body 108 is rotated in the reactor vessel 105. Electric current can be provided to the reactor vessel through a positive and negative contact of the rotational contact 101 and is guided by means of conductive, insulated wires to the reactor body through an electrical conduit to the positive 228 and negative 227 electrical contacts in the electrical contact chamber 245. In one embodiment, a hollow reactor isolation shaft 103 is provided through which insulated wires are carried to the positive 228 and negative 227 electrical contacts in the electrical contact chamber 245 (see also FIG. 2), which can be covered by an electrical contact chamber cover 215 arranged above the upper connection piece 216. The hollow reactor isolation shaft 103 can be secured onto the electrical contact chamber cover 215 by a reactor-insulation-shaft lock-nut 214. In certain embodiments, the reactor isolation shaft lock-nut 214, the hollow reactor isolation shaft 103, the upper connection piece 216, the bottom connection piece 221, and the bottom shaft 225 can be constructed from inert materials, such as plastic. The upper connection piece 216 can be secured by top structural outer ring plastic acorn nuts 229. [00057] In an embodiment, as shown in FIG. 2, first conductive studs 218 can be provided to connect the positive lead from the positive contact 228 to the electric contact bushings 219, to the top current distributor 220, then to the top electric contact plate 230, and next via the electric conductive springs 241 to the top electrode plate 233. The negative lead can also be connected from the negative contact 227 via second conductive studs 268, to the electric contact bushings 263, to the bottom current distributor 222, and then via the electric conductive springs 241 to the bottom electrode plate 236. [00058] The conductive studs 218 connected to a positive lead can be electrically isolated from all other components by isolation components, such as, for example, plastic isolation tubes 242 around the conductive studs 218 connected to a positive lead and by means of the plastic isolation bushings 223 from the bottom current distributor 222, as well as the bottom metal electric contact plates 239. The conductive studs 268 connected to a negative lead can also be isolated from all other components by isolation components such as plastic isolation tubes provided around the conductive studs 268 connected to a negative lead and isolated by means of the isolation bushings 269 from the top current distributor 220. [00059] Electric current is introduced into the to-be treated fluid from a positive electrode plate 230 or 236 (depending on the polarity of the electric current). The electric current is then transferred through intermediate electrode plates 234 on the intermediate plastic support plates 235 via the electric conductive springs 241, to the opposite electrode plates 234 on the intermediate plastic support plate 235 where the polarity of the two electrode plates 234 on the intermediate plastic support plate 235 is opposite and can be reversed. Most conventional reactors are constructed without support plates, particularly for the intermediate electrodes. In certain embodiments, the present invention includes plastic plates to support the electrodes in order to keep the structural integrity of the reactor intact, constant and independent of any reduction in thickness of sacrificial electrode plates. [00060] In some embodiments, as shown in FIG. 2, at least one pair of intermediate electrode plates 234, may be mounted together, such that an intermediate plastic support plate 235 is mounted between a top intermediate electrode plate 234 and a bottom intermediate electrode plate 234, and such the top intermediate electrode plate 234 and the bottom intermediate electrode plate 234 are electrically connected via an electric conductive spring 241, such that a first channel 243 is formed above the top intermediate electrode plate 234, and a second channel 243 is formed below the bottom intermediate electrode plate 234. [00061] In some embodiments, the reactor body 108 may not have any intermediate plates. In certain embodiments, the reactor body 108 may have 1 to about 1000 intermediate plates 234 in series. The number of intermediate plates to be used can be determined based on operational conditions of the reactor and the characteristics, including contamination level of the to-be treated fluid. [00062] In certain embodiments, and depending on the operating conditions of the process of the to-be treated fluid, multiple reactor bodies can be placed in series in the reactor vessel. In order to increase the capacity and/or to reduce the residence time of fluid in a reactor body, two or more reactor bodies can be placed in series. The production of metal ions and metal hydroxides in the case of an electrocoagulation reactor and oxidants in the case of both electrocoagulation and electro-oxidation reactors is directly proportional to the electrode surface area. The more electrode surface area is available, the lower the current per surface area. [00063] FIG. 6 shows an exploded top perspective view of the reactor body 108, which is also shown in FIG. 2. [00064] In a related embodiment, as shown in FIG. 6, the reactor body 108 can include a plurality of support studs 610, which are electrically isolated, such that each support stud is mounted through each contact plate 233 234 236 in the plate stack, and thereby serve to mechanically connect the contact plates 233 234 236, and stabilize the plate-stack 260. The support studs 610 can for example be electrically isolated from the contact plates 233 234 236 with top and bottom isolation bushings 269 223 and with isolation tubes 242. As shown, the central chamber 244 is encircled by the plate stack 260, such that fluid flows from the central chamber 244, via channels 243 in the plate-stack 260, to the annulus 111, and then to the outlet 107. [00065] In a related embodiment, as shown in FIG. 6, each of the contact plates 233 234 236 can be a circular angled plate, with an inner aperture 606 formed by an inner periphery 602, such that the inner periphery 602 is lower than an outer periphery 604, whereby the contact plate 233 234 236 is angled upwards from the inner periphery 602. Thereby, the plate stack 260 of circular angled plates 233 234 236, has a central chamber 244 formed by a plurality of inner apertures 606. [00066] FIG. 7 shows an exploded bottom perspective view of the reactor body 108, further showing a bottom chamber inlet 702, into which fluid is pumped by the inlet turbine 224, such that the fluid flows via the chamber inlet 702 into the central chamber 244. [00067] When two reactor bodies are provided in series in a reactor vessel, as illustrated in FIG. 5, a first reactor body 502 is provided at the bottom of a reactor vessel and a second reactor body 504 is provided above the first reactor body. Fluid leaving the first reactor body 502 enters the second reactor body 504 via its bottom feed turbine. Next, the fluid flows through gaps, over the electrode, and then into the annulus 111 between the second reactor body 504 and the reactor vessel. [00068] In such an embodiment, each of the reactors needs to produce only half the electrolytic reagents as compared to a reactor vessel having one reactor body. In one embodiment, if a specific fluid requires the output of a certain amount of aluminum hydroxide, this amount of aluminum hydroxide output can be obtained from a single reactor body using Y current, or from multiple reactor bodies using current equal to Y divided by the number of reactor bodies used in series. [00069] In an embodiment including multiple reactors, the lower current can allow for better control over the particle distribution, particle growth rate, and the size of the flocculated materials, compared to a process requiring the use of higher current. Also, the more electrode surface area is available, the more mixing of these ions/oxidants will occur, thereby resulting in an even more homogenous controlled flocculation of the fluid. [00070] In one embodiment, 2 to 4 reactor bodies can be placed in series in a reactor vessel. [00071] FIG. 4 shows an example embodiment of the present invention in which three reactor bodies are placed in series in a reactor vessel 405. In the non-limiting embodiment shown in FIG. 4, feed pump 450 pumps fluid into the reactor vessel. First 451, second 453, and third 455 serial reactor bodies are shown having a drive shaft 402. Fluid enters the first serial reactor body 451 through a first turbine wheel or impeller 452, which pressurizes the reactor vessel. Rotation of the drive shaft 402 creates a Tesla pump function, forcing the fluid through the first serial reactor body 451 in a controlled manner as indicated by the fluid flow arrows shown, such that the fluid enters the first central chamber 444 and then flows through channels 443 in the first plate stack 460. Next, fluid enters the second serial reactor body 453 through a second turbine wheel or impeller 454 and the fluid flows through the second serial reactor body 453 in a controlled manner as indicated by the fluid flow arrows shown. Then, fluid enters the third serial reactor body 455 through a third turbine wheel or impeller 456 and the fluid flows through the third serial reactor body 455 in a controlled manner as indicated by the fluid flow arrows shown. The fluid is then expelled from the third serial reactor body 455 in a controlled manner. [00072] Reversing the polarity of the electrodes provides advantageous control of the extent of reactions that take place on each of the reactor plates, e.g., the amount of metal dissolved, the amount of hydroxyl groups produced and the mixing rate. The timing between the reversals can also be controlled allowing for the reactions to take place in the bulk solution in the reactor. Reversing the polarity of the electrodes reverses the functionality of the electrodes. When polarity is reversed, the anode prior to reversal is reversed into the cathode and the cathode prior to reversal is reversed into the anode. Hence, the electrolytic actions on the electrodes are reversed. This results in a mixing of the metal ions with the OH groups, as well as the production of metal hydroxides and a mixing of the various oxidants. The time during which the anode functions as anode determines the amount of metal ions/oxidants that are produced. Similarly, the time during which the cathode functions as the cathode determines the quantity of OH/oxidant groups on the cathode. The electrical controls can vary this time infinitely. In certain embodiments, the time may be varied in a range of seconds to hours. In other embodiments, the time may be varied from 0.00001 second to 60 minutes. In other embodiments, the time may be varied from 0.001 second to 30 minutes. In some embodiments, the time may be varied from 0.01 second to 10 minutes, 5 minutes, or 2 minutes. The time between the polarity reversals of the electrodes is required to control the mixing of the metal ions and oxidants with the bulk solution of the liquid, and to allow for a controlled action of the metal ions and oxidants with the bulk solution. [00073] Accordingly, in some embodiments, during use of the electrochemical reactor, the polarity of the DC current can be reversed. Accordingly, an electrical controller or oscillator can be provided to reverse polarity of the current. In certain embodiments, the DC current can be reversed intermittently based on the desired electrochemical process conditions. [00074] In related embodiments, the Amplitude or Amperage is the amount of current flowing in the reactor. The amperage depends on the conductivity of the electrical circuit in the reactor, and varies in relation to the resistance of the liquid in between the reactor plates and the additional resistance of the circuitry, and the electric potential difference between the electrode plates, in accordance with Ohm's law. [00075] A static power supply provide a constant voltage, which for example can be continuous + 1.5 Volt when the reactor is in an active state. [00076] In an embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 8, the voltage source 120 can be configured to provide polarity reversal, variable voltage, and control of voltage pulse duration of the voltage potential, current, amplitude and duration of the current. As shown, voltage potential can be greatly varied with time. The frequency, duration, and amplitude of DC pulse 802 or square DC wave patterns can greatly influence the electrolytic action on the positive and negative electrode plates. Intermittent periods 804 of zero potential between the DC pulses 802 can allow for a pause in the production of metal ions, OH groups and oxidation, allowing for reaction in the reactor 108. The frequencies of power to, polarity change as well as the time between the "DC-pulses" (or) square DC wave patterns regulates the reaction and the power efficiency of the reactor. [00077] In an embodiment, the rotational speed of the electrochemical reactor body can be variable, and can be adjusted depending on the desired electrochemical process conditions in the reactor process. [00078] The bottom electrode plate 236 and the top electrode plate 233 are considered mono-polar electro-plates, while the intermediate electrode plates (represented by 234) are considered bi-polar plates. Current flows between the positive mono-polar electrode plate 236 to the intermediate electrode plate 234 and to a next intermediate bipolar electro-plate 234 (in certain embodiments, the reactor may contain additional intermediate plates) and consequently to the negative electrode plate 233. When the polarity of the DC current is reversed, the functions of the positive and negative electroplates are reversed, as well as the polarity of intermediary bi-polar electro-plate(s) 234. [00079] FIGS. 1 and 2 show the electrode plates 233,234 and 236 installed in the electrochemical reactor body and configured such that the exterior portions of the electrode plates are raised at an angle 280 toward the top of the electrochemical reactor, as shown in FIG 2. The angle provides, inter alia, easy evacuation of gases produced during the electrochemical process. The angle 280 can be selected from an angle greater than 0 degrees up to 45 degrees. [00080] The rotating movement of this reactor body causes high shear-rate flow of the to-be treated fluid over the rotating electrode-plates. The absence of static electrode plates in the rotational reactor reduces the negative effects of the boundary layer- limitations of conventional static reactors and results in a drastic improvement of the mixing of the electrolytic-reagents and or electrochemical reaction within the bulk volume of the electrochemical reactor. Embodiments of the invention have advantages over static reactors in which flocculation or oxidation cannot be controlled, including the capability to control and minimize flocculation. Further, the moving electrode plates do not have fixed boundary layers. As such, the fluid comes into contact with the electrode plates for the electrochemical reactions to occur. [00081] The channels 243 correspondingly have the same angle 280 as the electrode plates, because the channels are formed by the distance between the electrode plates. The channels 243 draw treated fluid through the reactor body, out into the annulus 111, and upward toward the fluid outlet 107 for controlled and efficient fluid expulsion. As such, the invention provides homogeneous mixing, controlled reaction, safe and effective venting of gases, and efficient electrochemical process as a result of the design of the dynamic electrochemical reactor. Continuous rotation and reversal of polarity effects continuous and homogeneous mixing of the fluid and electrochemical reactions that are controlled having high mass transfer efficiency. [00082] FIG. 3 shows a top view of the electrical contact chamber of the reactor body across plane B-B. The upper connection piece 216 is secured by the top structural outer ring plastic acorn nuts 229 to the reactor body. Electric current is delivered to the negative 227 and positive 228 electric contacts in the electrical contact chamber, via insulated electric wires passing through the drive shaft 102. [00083] In one embodiment, the dynamic electrochemical reactor is constructed entirely out of plastic materials, other than the electrode plates 233, 234 and 236, the tension / electrical conductive studs 218, wiring, the electrical conducting springs 241 and electrical chamber acorn nuts 217. [00084] In various related embodiments, plastic components in the rotational electrochemical reactor 100 can be made from various plastic materials. Most polymers sometimes referred to as resins, may be used, including all thermoplastics, some thermosets, and some elastomers. The plastic materials should allow use of glue, in most cases two compound epoxy glues, to allow the reactor plates to be incorporated into these plastic parts to have a permanent and functional bonding between the reactor plates and plastic components. Examples of suitable plastic materials are: ABS ( acrylonitrile butadiene styrene); polyoxymethylene (acetal plastic); high density polyethylene; low density polyethylene; nylon; glass fiber filled nylon; polyetherimide; polycarbonate; polyvinyl chloride and other thermoplastic elastomers. [00085] In further related embodiments, epoxy glues are mostly used as bonding material between the various plastic components and the reactor plates. The reactor plates can be metal plates or a metal/glue/diamond sandwich construction. The epoxy glues can be electrically conductive or electrically isolative. [00086] In related embodiments, plastic components can be made from high temperature thermoplastic polymers or Carbon-Fiber-Epoxy Composites. [00087] The various embodiments of the invention have the advantages of enabling high efficiency onsite treatment of fluids without the need for adding remote or off-site facilities and avoiding the costs and environmental risks of transporting fluids to the off-site treatment facility. Eliminating truck traffic by recycling fluid has numerous environmental benefits. Further, embodiments of the invention can be useful for treating contaminated fluids, particularly drinking water and pharmaceuticals, because it lyses bacterial walls. By eliminating chemicals in the treatment process, there is less concern for contamination of aquifers and possible danger to personnel handling chemicals on site. In addition, there is essentially no waste stream produced. All materials become non-reactive. In appropriate embodiments of use, the treated fluid may be safely discharged into the environment, eliminating the need to store or transport fluids for further treatment. Embodiments of the invention can greatly decrease consumptive use of fresh water by allowing industries to recycle wastewater. [00088] In conventional chemical flocculation and conventional electrocoagulation applications, there is a need for clarification and or sedimentation of the flocculated solids. This is in most cases a tedious and time-consuming process. Since the flocculation is not precisely controlled, the size of the floes are not uniform, and results in non-uniform sedimentation and/or flotation times, making the separation process subject to great variation and unpredictability. The uncontrollable violent reactions in conventional static electrocoagulation systems also produce foam, requiring an addition of anti-foaming agents and/or the use of de-foaming systems. In some cases, membrane separation units can be used for separating the flocculated components. [00089] In various embodiments, the rotational electrochemical reactor 100 can be configured to treat the incoming fluid and to control the electrolytic reaction in such a way that the coagulation produces a continuous stream of controlled small floes. This is possible because of the electrical control over the reaction, as well as the control over the residence time of the fluid in the reactor 100, and if required a recycling of this liquid in the reactor or the treatment of this liquid in a subsequent reactor. The controlled electrolytic reaction allows for a precise release of metal ions in the reactor 100, and a precise production of OH groups. At controlled intervals, the polarities of the reactor plates can be reversed and a precise production of Al (01-1)3 can be achieved, which will result in a precise control over the flocculation. The controls over this process will result in a controlled floc-size and therefore a controlled size and distribution of the particles (the floc-particles). [00090] In related embodiments, residence time can be adjusted according to the inflowing liquid, since the electrolytic reactions of the electro-plates do not have the same effect on all liquids. [00091] In related embodiments, the rotational speed of the reactor body 108 results in a pumping action of the reactor body 108 in the reactor vessel 105, and the transfer of the liquid can be controlled by the rotational speed of the reactor body 108. [00092] In related embodiments, the inlet turbine 224 can be adjusted to a predetermined efficiency, which either increases or decreases/"starves" the flow in the reactor, as compared to the capacity of the friction pumping value of the reactor. [00093] In related embodiments, the configuration of the inlet turbine 224 can be altered depending on the process conditions. [00094] In related embodiments, part of the flow 104 leaving the reactor vessel can be continuously returned to the reactor vessel 105, thereby allowing for additional residence time. [00095] In related further embodiments, residence time of liquid in the reactor 100 can be under full control by reactor operational procedures, as explained above. [00096] In related embodiments, the monitoring and control of the reaction in the reactor can be achieved by a number of instruments: a. A conductivity sensor i. The conductivity of the liquid entering the reactor is a representation of the quantity of conductive materials (minerals in general). ii. The addition of metal ions released from the Anode in the reactor will increase the conductivity. iii. The removal of the flocculated materials in the subsequent clarification process indicates the amount of minerals that are removed from the original fluid 1. Conductivity 1 (before reactor); is caused by minerals in feed liquid. 2. Conductivity 2 (in-after reactor); results from minerals in feed liquid and metal ions released by the reactor 100. 3. Conductivity 3 (after clarification); equals Conductivity 2 - Conductivity 1, and depends on efficiency of the mineral removal of the reactor 100. iv. The residence time and/or power applied to the reactor 100 can be adjusted to increase the efficiency of the reactor 100. b. Turbidity sensor i. The addition of the metal ions will greatly increase the turbidity of the liquid after the reactor. ii. The removal of the turbidity is a second indication of the efficiency of the reactor and can be adjusted by residence time and/or power adjustments of the reactor. c. Particle size sensor/particle counting spectrometer i. I n this technology the particle size and quantity before and after the Reactor and clarifier can provide a complete analysis of the particle size and distribution of the liquid, as well as the performance of the reactor 100 and clarification process in real-time data, which can allow a full adjustment to the reactor residence and/or power requirements. [00097] I n various embodiments, electrode plates and rotational velocity of the reactor 100 can be configured such that: a. The configuration of the electrode plates are configured as flat plates that are placed under a 5 - 25 degree angle 280, and the angled flat plates are placed in a circular configuration, wherein each electrode plate occupies a 45-degree arc of the total circle. This allows for an optimal turbulence mixing and pumping action of the electrode plates, and additionally results in an optimal function as a Tesla type pump. b. The rotational speed control can allow for a control of the pumping action of the Tesla type pump, and results in a controlled residence time. [00098] I n various embodiments, current control of the reactor 100 can be configured such that: a. The control of the voltage and amperage of the DC current applied to the electrode plates increases and or decreases the electrolytic action on the electrode plates. b. The frequency control over the polarity reversal, the applied DC current, and the absence of DC current, results in a controlled timing of the electrolytic action on the reactor plates. c. The combination of the control over the residence time, the control over the power and frequency in the electrolytic reaction on the electrodes can result in a total control over the electro-oxidation and or electrocoagulation process in the reactor 100, resulting in a complete control over performance of the electrochemical reactor 100 on the to be treated fluid. [00099] I n various embodiments, the rotational electrochemical reactor 100 can be configured to perform electro-oxidation, such that: a. the following type of permanent electrode plate and plate materials are used: i.

Which equates to the following plate-gap count: i. 12Volt: (EO) reactor: 12 : 1.5 = 8 plates ii. 24Volt: (EO) reactor: 24 : 1.5 = 16 plates iii. 48 Volt (EO) reactor: 48 : 1.5 = 32 plates [000100] In various embodiments, the reactor rotational electrochemical reactor 100 can be configured to perform electro-coagulation, such that: a. the following the following sacrificial electrode plates and plate materials are used: i. Iron; ii. Aluminum; iii. Magnesium; iv. Lead; v. Copper; vi. Graphite; vii. Graphene; viii. Other oxidative metals and materials; or ix. Combinations of these; b. The number of electrode plates can vary, but is normally arranged depending on: i. Capacity of the reactor body and reactor vessel; ii.

Which equates to the following plate-gap count: i. 12Volt: (EC) reactor: 12 : 3.0 = 4 plates ii. 24Volt: (EC) reactor: 24 : 3.0 = 8 plates iii. 48 Volt (EC) reactor: 48 : 3.0 = 16 plates In further related embodiments: a. The Pulse Lengths, Amplitude and used Voltage can be infinitely varied to accommodate the functionality and performance of the rotational reactors. b. The plate gap voltage can vary as indicate earlier between 0.5 and 4.5 volts, but normally between 1.5Volt and 3.0 Volt per plate-gap. c. The Pulse-Lengths vary from 1 Hz (1 polarity change per second) to as high as 1,000,000 Hz (1,000,000 polarity changes per second). d. The pauses between the Pulses can have a similar length, varying between 1 Hz (1 polarity change per second) to as high as 1,000,000 Hz (1,000,000 polarity changes per second). e. The amplitudes of the Pulses can differ from positive to negative, as indicated on FIG. 8, and can be independently adjusted by variable resistors in electronic circuitry to suite any required level necessary to the to be treated liquid; f. Plate gaps are normally in the 3 - 5 mm range but can vary from 2 mm to as much as 10 mm g. Plate gaps will increase where sacrificial electrode plates are used (for electro-coagulation), but are steady where permanent electrode plates are used (for electro-oxidation). h. The Pulse Lengths, Amplitude and used Voltage are adjusted continuously according the operating conditions and compensated for an increased plate- gap in the (EO) reactor, where the sacrificial electrode plates are consumed, resulting in an increased dimension of the plate-gap.
