b) A solution of methyl magnesium bromide (1.4 M solution in 3:1 toluene/THF, 1.4 mL, 2.0 mmol) was added to a flask containing 4-acetyl-N-(3-methyl-1-(quinolin-5-yl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)benzenesulfonamide (0.059 g, 0.15 mmol) in THF (6 mL) at −45° C. with stirring. The reaction mixture was slowly warmed to −10° C. over 1 h and 4:1 dichloromethane/methanol was added (2 mL). The organic layer was washed with aqueous saturated ammonium chloride, dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was purified by reverse phase HPLC (C18 column, acetonitrile-H2O with 0.1% TFA as eluent) to give the title compound as a white solid (0.020 g, 0.047 mmol, 32%).
