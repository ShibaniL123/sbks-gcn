Step 4 Synthesis of compound 57g
A solution of the compound 57f (505.4 mg, 1.20 mmol) in dichloromethane (5 mL) was cooled in ice. Then, bromoacetyl bromide (0.250 mL, 2.88 mmol) was added, and subsequently, triethylamine (0.400 mL, 2.88 mmol) was added to the solution. Under ice cooling, the mixture was stirred for 1 hour. Then, a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride was added to the mixture, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Magnesium sulfate was filtered off. Then, the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) to afford the compound 57g (386 mg, 59%).
