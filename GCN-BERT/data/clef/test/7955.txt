TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to an electrical field application method of applying an electrical field for maturing food, preserving freshness thereof, causing food to ferment, etc. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In general, it is known to apply a high voltage to food and to put the food in an electrical field atmosphere for preserving freshness of the food or facilitating a maturing processing of the food. Such the electrical field atmosphere is formed by an electric power source having a voltage of from 2 kV to 10 kV and a commercial electric power source frequency (50 or 60 Hz). When conducting a freshness preservation processing or a maturing processing of food, the inside of a refrigerator is kept at a temperature of from 0 to −2° C., and the electrical field atmosphere is formed by the above-mentioned electric power source merely. In addition, it is also known that the electrical field has a function of inhibiting growth of bacterium attached to food and that the electrical field is applied to fermented beverage. PRIOR ART DOCUMENT Patent Document [Patent Document 1] Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 2001-204428 [Patent Document 2] PCT International Application No. WO98/41115 [Patent Document 3] Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 2005-156042 [Patent Document 4] Japanese Patent Provisional Publication No. 2001-190444 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Subject to be Solved by the Invention However, the above-mentioned Patent Documents 1 and 2 use the same electrical field application method without making differentiation between the freshness preservation of the food and the facilitation of the maturing processing of the food, and the main purpose of applying the electrical field is not clear as to whether for the freshness preservation or the facilitation of the maturing processing. In addition, the above-mentioned Patent Document 3 discloses application of the electrical field to lactobacillus beverage, but neither discloses that the application of the electrical field has a function of facilitating fermentation, nor any specific application method for that. Further, in the above-mentioned Patent Document 4, there has not been taken a sufficient consideration of how the electrical field is applied to enhance a growth inhabitation effect of the bacterium. Means to Solve the Subject Hence, the electrical field application method of the first invention comprises the steps of: rectifying, when placing food such as livestock meat, fish meat, chicken meat, vegetable, fruit, etc. in an electrical field atmosphere to execute a freshness preservation processing or a maturing processing, a sine wave of an electric power source by which an electrical field is to be formed in the food, to conduct a positive (+) wave rectification that provides a positive (+) wave component and a negative (−) wave rectification that provides a negative (−) wave component, and applying, in case of the freshness preservation processing, a negative rectified wave to the food, or in case of the maturing processing, a positive rectified wave to the food. In addition, the electrical field application method of the second invention comprises the step of: applying an electrical field having a voltage larger than 100 V and a frequency of 50 Hz or more to fermentation micro-organism such as lactobacillus of yogurt, Bacillus subtilis derived from rice bran, etc., thus facilitating fermentation. Further, the electrical field application method of the third invention comprises the step of: applying an electrical field having a voltage larger than 100 V and a frequency of 50 Hz or more to phytoplankton, thus providing increase in number thereof and growth thereof. Further, the electrical field application method of the fourth invention comprises the step of: applying intermittently an electrical field to bacterium attached to food, such as viable bacterium, staphylococcal bacterium, etc., thus inhibiting growth of the bacterium. Function of the Invention An application of a half-wave rectification or a full-wave rectification in which a positive (+) wave component has been rectified by rectifying a sine wave, to food, can facilitate the maturing process of meat, fish and vegetable (Korean pickle, etc.), and an application of a half-wave rectification or a full-wave rectification in which a negative (−) wave component has been rectified, to food, can facilitate a freshness preservation processing of such as meat, fish and vegetables, thus permitting a selective control of the electric power source, depending on the purpose. An electric power source having a larger frequency than a commercial electric power source (50, 60 Hz) and a larger voltage than 100 V may cause an increase in the activity of fermentation micro-organism such as lactobacillus of yogurt, Bacillus subtilis derived from rice bran, etc., thus making it possible to manufacture fermented food having a pleasant taste such as yogurt, pickled vegetable, Korean pickle, dried fish (Kusaya in Japanese), salted fish guts (Shiokara in Japanese), etc. In addition, concerning phytoplankton, use of the same electric power source as in the fermentation micro-organism may cause an increase in the activity of phytoplankton to facilitate a photosynthesis reaction, with the result that the phytoplankton may be cultivated in low illumination in a plant factory, and it may contribute to cultivation of fish. In addition, an intermittent application of an electrical field to bacterium attached to food to produce a physical effect, such as viable bacterium, staphylococcal bacterium, etc., at predetermined time intervals may slow down ability of the bacterium to adopt to environment, thus permitting to inhibit growth of the bacterium.

EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION Now, embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings. It is known, as an art to preserve freshness of food such as livestock meat, fish meat, vegetable, etc., thaw the frozen thereof, or mature the food, to insulate the food electrically and apply a high voltage (1 kV˜7 kV) through an electrode to the food. Besides thaw with a smaller amount of drip, the preservation of freshness and the maturing facilitation may apparently-contradictory in effect to each other, but it has been known that application of an alternating current sine wave to food would provide both effects in a balanced manner. An electrical field processing of livestock meat, fish meat, vegetable, etc. is constituted by providing an electrode plate 2 in a refrigerator 1, placing food 3 on this electrode plate 2 in an insulated state, and connecting an electric power source 4 to the above-mentioned electrode plate 2, so as to apply a voltage (1˜5 kV) of an alternating current sine wave (FIG. 2) from this electric power source 4, as generally shown in FIG. 1. Such an application of the voltage of the sine wave can provide the effects of freshness preservation and maturing facilitation of the food in a balanced manner. However, application of voltage of a positive (+; plus) half-wave rectification as shown in FIG. 3, or voltage of a waveform of a full-wave rectification in which positive components continues as shown in FIG. 4 can remarkably facilitate the maturing effect, and conversely application of voltage of a negative (−; minus) half-wave wave rectification as shown in FIG. 5, or voltage of a waveform of a full-wave rectification in which negative components continues as shown in FIG. 6 can remarkably facilitate the freshness preservation effect. Concerning the waveform, the positive or negative component of a pulse waveform as shown in FIG. 10 or a triangle waveform as shown in FIG. 11 may be used for any purpose, and there may be used a waveform in which the positive or negative component of the sine wave is formed of a combined body of pulse waves as shown in FIG. 12. 1) First Experimental Example Selective Waveform Control A sine wave, a positive half-wave rectification and a negative half-wave rectification were applied to livestock meat and fish meat placed in a refrigerator. The results are shown in Table 1. Experiment Conditions Temperature of Refrigerator −1° C. Humidity of Refrigerator 30~50% Electric Power Source 50 Hz, 5 kV Period of time five days Assessment Freshness preservation Visual contact Maturing amino acid content TABLE 1 Freshness Maturing preservation (Amino acid) Sine wave ◯ ◯ Positive (+) half-wave Δ ⊚ rectification Negative (−) half-wave ⊚ Δ rectification Wherein, Δ denotes slightly no good, ◯, good, and ⊚, excellent. It is revealed from these results that the sine wave provides the effects of freshness preservation and maturing facilitation in a balanced manner, the positive half-wave rectification provides the excellent maturing facilitation effect, but provides slightly no good freshness preservation effect, and the negative half-wave rectification provides the excellent freshness preservation effect, but provides slightly no good maturing facilitation effect. Therefore, the waveform may be selected for any purposes. In addition, the electrical field atmosphere activates fermentation micro-organism such as lactobacillus, Bacillus subsilis, etc., which makes food tasty. Its effects depend on a frequency and a voltage, and the results are indicated in Table 2 and Table 3. 2) Second Experimental Example Facilitation of Fermentation Experiment Conditions Kind of Bacteria Bacillus subtilis derived from rice bran (Bacillus species) Temperature 40° C. Humidity 50% Electric Power Source Frequency 50 Hz, 300 Hz Voltage 5 kV Waveform Sine wave Fermentation material Defatted soybean Start Temperature 40° C. TABLE 2 Control Electrical Electrical Region (without field (50 field (300 electrical field) Hz, 5 kV) Hz, 5 kV) Results Peak temperature 52 degrees 55 degrees 57 degrees of Fermentation heat Required time the 20 hours 18 hours 16.5 hours fermentation heat reaches to peak It is revealed from Table 2 that 20 hours were required, without electrical field, until the defatted soybean as the fermentation material fermented and its fermentation heat reached the peak temperature of 52° C. from 40° C., and increase in frequency and voltage not only increased the peak temperature of the fermentation heat to 57° C., but also reduced the time required for the fermentation heat to reach the peak temperature to 16.5 hours. It is considered that the electrical field having a high voltage and a high frequency may activate ferment of microorganism, and facilitate a biochemical reaction of oxidation-reduction in the body of microorganism. 3) Third Experimental Example Facilitation of Fermentation As shown in FIG. 7, there were prepared two boxes in which a temperature and humidity therein were controllable, containers 8 and 9 were placed in them, respectively. An electrode plate 10 was placed in the box 6, an electric power source 11 was connected to the electrode plate 10, and the box 6 served as a control region and the box 6 served as an electrical field region. The above-mentioned containers 8, 9 were made of polypropylene and had the volume of 236 cc. 200 cc of whole milk (at least 8.3% nonfat milk solid, at least 3.5% milk fat, and 100% raw milk) and 15 cc of LB81 lactobacillus (Meiji Bulgaria Yogurt) or bifidobacteria were put in these containers to cause the bacteria to ferment. The results are shown in Table 3. Experiment Conditions Kind of Bacteria LB81 lactobacillus (Meiji Bulgaria Yogurt) Temperature 25° C. (A lower temperature was set for comparison purpose, although a temperature at which yogurt was normally prepared was 40° C.) Humidity 45~50% Electric Power Source 50 Hz, 1.0~2.0 mA, 5 kV, Sine wave Application period 24 hours of time TABLE 3 Control Region Electrical Field Region Hardness Soft Hard (Between drinkable (Normal yogurt) yogurt and normal yogurt) Free water Existence No existence Feeling on tongue Coarse Fine (feel like silk) Acerbity Normal Soft As is clear from the results of Table 3, the electrical field region provided the same results as in LB81 lactobacillus and bifidobacteria, and activation of the fermentation micro-organism was facilitated so that the raw milk became almost normal yogurt for 24 hours. In the control region without electrical field, there was observed a free-water section 12 on the surface of which water floated, but such a section was not at all observed in the electrical field region, and the resultant was fine and not strongly sour, thus providing a soft feeling. 4) Forth Experimental Example Growth of Phytoplankton Based on the fact of the electrical field atmosphere activating phytoplankton, 0.5% cooking water of clam and freshwater chlorella were added to fresh water and the resultant was exposed to light having an illuminance of 450 LUX for a period of one month, to grow the phytoplankton. The results are shown in Table 4. Experiment Conditions Kind of water Freshwater Phytoplankton Freshwater chlorella Culture solution (cooking water 0.5% of clam) concentration Illuminance 450 LUX Temperature 28° C. Growth period of time one month Electric Power Source 50 Hz, 300 Hz, 5 kV, Sine wave TABLE 4 Electrical Electrical Control field (50 field (300 Region (without Hz, 5000 Hz, 5000 electrical field) V) V) Results Initial density of 200/ml 200/ml 200/ml phytoplankton Final density of 280/ml 620/ml 740/ml phytoplankton As is clear from the results of Table 4, the electrical field grew the phytoplankton, and the higher voltage than 100 V and the higher frequency than a normal frequency of 50 Hz could provide a remarkable activation effect. Photon is required for a photosynthesis reaction of the phytoplankton. The photon energy is low at a low illuminance, resulting in little progress of the photosynthesis reaction. However, application of the electrical field (electron) would lower a threshold of energy required for the photosynthesis reaction, and a relatively low illuminance may facilitate the photosynthesis reaction. This makes it possible to decrease the illuminance at a plant factory, thus leading to energy conservation. 5) Fifth Experimental Example Inhibition of Growth of Bacterium Bacterium, which is to be generally attached to food, such as viable bacterium, Bacillus coli, staphylococcal bacterium, etc., may increase, without an electrical field, at a constant rate as time proceeds, as shown in a straight line A in FIG. 8. In case of continuously applying the electrical field, there is a tendency that an increase rate is low as shown in a curved line B until a predetermined period of time lapses, but then, the bacterium may get familiar with the environment and rapidly increase, resulting in a more rapid growth in comparison with a case where no electrical field is applied. Therefore, it is possible to inhibit the latest growth of the bacterium by changing the environment to blunt the environmental responsiveness of the bacterium, before it gets familiar with the environment of the electric field. So, the bacteria such as viable bacterium, Bacillus coli, staphylococcal bacterium, etc., were cultivated in Petri dishes as placed in a refrigerator, and the bacteria were subjected to an alternate process in which an electrical field-ON-step and an electrical field-OFF-step were repeated every 15 minutes, for a period of 72 hours, and then a total number of bacteria in the Petri dishes was counted with the use of a microscope. The inhibiting effects of bacteria growth are shown in Table 5. Experiment Conditions Refrigerator temperature 0° C. Electric Power Source 50 Hz, 5 kV, Sine wave ON-OFF control every 15 minutes Application period of time 72 hours TABLE 5 Number of viable Bacillus coli Staphylococcal bacterium group bacterium Application 0/g Negative/0.1 g Negative/0.01 g timing control made Application 5300/g Negative/0.1 g 5/0.01 g timing control not made It is revealed from Table 5 that, for the viable bacterium, the application timing control by which the electrical field is applied intermittently provided remarkable effects of inhibiting the growth of the bacterium in comparison with the case where such an application timing control was not made, but there was no difference, for Bacillus coil. For staphylococcal bacterium, the application timing control provided a slightly good effect in comparison with the case where such an application timing control was not made. Incidentally, concerning the intermittent ON/OFF timing control, the environmental responsiveness of the bacterium may be remarkably blunted by appropriately changing the time intervals T1ON and T2ON for the ON step and the time intervals T1OFF and T2OFF for the OFF step, as shown in FIG. 9.
