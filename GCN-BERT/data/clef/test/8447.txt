EXAMPLE 64
3-isopropyl-5-(2-methoxy-3-methylphenyl)-1-{2-oxo-2-[4-(2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione (compound 64)
64.1: [3-isopropyl-5-(2-methoxy-3-methylphenyl)-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid
Similarly to example 13.3, starting from 500 mg (1.6 mmol) of (5-bromo-3-isopropyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-methyl acetate (prepared as described in example 59.1) and 408 mg (2.5 mmol) of 2-methoxy-3-methylphenyl boronic acid, 495 mg (91%) of [3-isopropyl-5-(2-methoxy-3-methylphenyl)-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid is obtained in the form of a beige solid.
