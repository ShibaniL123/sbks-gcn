(S)-4-(2-(5-Methyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-ylamino)-2-(2-phenylthiazol-4-yl)ethyl)phenylsulfamic acid (55)
Preparation of [3-diazo-1-(4-nitrobenzyl)-2-oxo-propyl]-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (50): To a 0 °C solution of 2-(S)-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-propionic acid (1.20 g, 4.0 mmol) in THF (20 mL) is added dropwise triethylamine (0.61 mL, 4.4 mmol) followed by iso-butyl chloroformate (0.57 mL, 4.4 mmol). The reaction mixture is stirred at 0 °C for 20 minutes then filtered. The filtrate is treated with an ether solution of diazomethane (∼16 mmol) at 0 °C. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 3 hours and concentrated. The residue is dissolved in EtOAc and washed successively with water and brine, dried (Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue is purified over silica (hexane/EtOAc 2:1) to afford 1.1 g (82% yield) of the desired product as a slightly yellow solid.
