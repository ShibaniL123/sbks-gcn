Step 2: 4-((1-(6-fluoro-3-(pyridine-2-yl)quinoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one
22 mg of 4-((1-(6-fluoro-3-(pyridine-2-yl)quinoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one was prepared as a pale yellow solid by using mg (0.056 mmol) of 4-((1-(6-fluoro-3-(pyridine-2-yl)quinoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-5(8H)-one prepared in step 1 according to the same manner as described in step 8 of Example 1 (0.053 mmol, yield: 95%).
