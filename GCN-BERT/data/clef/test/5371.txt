Example 2: Synthesis of racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.monofumarate
Methanol suspension (20.73 g) containing fumaric acid (2.74 g: 23.6 mmol) was charged into a 50 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and methanol solution (9.00 g) containing racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine (3.00 g: 23.8 mmol) was added thereto while stirring at room temperature. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60° C., to obtain racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.monofumarate (5.56 g: 22.9 mmol, yield=97%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 207° C.
