CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/970,23S, filed Mar. 25, 2014, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND 1. Field of the Invention This disclosure relates to an electronic nicotine delivery device having a nicotine dosage sensor configured to determine and/or regulate an amount of nicotine delivered by the electronic nicotine delivery device. 2. Background of the Invention Electronic nicotine delivery devices (such as electronic cigarettes, vaporizers, and tobacco furnaces) are a widely popular means of nicotine delivery. Because they are more analogous to traditional cigarettes than other nicotine delivery devices like gums or patches, it is easier for most users to transition from traditional cigarettes to electronic nicotine delivery devices. Traditional cigarettes, by way of the smoke itself, create a self-limiting maximum rate of nicotine consumption because inhaling traditional cigarette smoke at an increased rate creates levels of discomfort (for example, coughing, carbon monoxide, heat from the smoke, etc.). The electronic nicotine delivery device, however, poses a risk of increased nicotine consumption because the almost-sensationless effect of inhaling the vaporized nicotine solution does not have the self-limiting side effects of traditional cigarettes. Due to inconsistency in manufacturing, the amount of nicotine delivered by each electronic nicotine delivery device may vary from unit to unit. Therefore, nicotine consumption per electronic nicotine delivery device cannot be reliably tracked. SUMMARY One embodiment of the present invention is an electronic nicotine delivery device including a nicotine dosage sensor that determines an amount of nicotine consumed by a user based on the duration of an inhalation. In some instances, the simple act of informing the user regarding nicotine consumption may reduce the nicotine consumption of the user. In other instances, the user may want to be restricted from exceeding a predetermined maximum nicotine consumption level. Accordingly, the electronic nicotine delivery device may restrict the amount of nicotine consumed by the user based on a predetermined nicotine consumption amount or user input. Exemplary embodiments of the present invention may enable an electronic nicotine delivery device to be classified as a smoking cessation device rather than a simple nicotine delivery system. This classification may enable the electronic nicotine delivery device to be purchased through health insurance providers and/or avoid the burdens of additional regulation. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Exemplary embodiments will be set forth with reference to the drawings, in which: FIG. 1 illustrates an electronic nicotine delivery device; FIG. 2 illustrates a nicotine dosage sensor according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention; FIG. 3 illustrates an electronic nicotine delivery device according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention; FIG. 4 illustrates an electronic nicotine delivery device according to yet another exemplary embodiment of the present invention; FIG. 5 illustrates an electronic nicotine delivery device according to yet another exemplary embodiment of the present invention; and FIG. 6 illustrates an electronic nicotine delivery device according to yet another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be set forth in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. The description set forth below and illustrated in part by the drawings is intended to serve as a description of exemplary embodiments of the application and is not intended to represent the only methods by which the present application can be constructed and/or utilized. The description sets forth the functions and the sequence of steps for constructing, calibrating and operating exemplary embodiments of the present invention. It is to be understood, however, that the same or equivalent functions and sequences can be accomplished by different embodiments that are also intended to be encompassed within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. Exemplary embodiments illustrated in the accompanying drawings are not necessarily to scale and are instead provided to convey the inventive concepts to one of ordinary skill in the art. FIG. 1 illustrates an electronic nicotine delivery device 100, including a reservoir 110 for storing a diluted nicotine solution 112, a power source 120, and a processor 130 and a heating element 140 (shown inside cut-out 150). The device 100 may also include a negative pressure switch or manually actuated switch (not shown). The processor 130 may be configured to electrically connect the power source 120 and the heating element 140 to vaporize the diluted nicotine solution 112 in response to the switch. The processor 130 may also provide very basic functions including passing current to a decorative light emitting diode (LED), regulating electrical current flow to the heating element 140, and limiting the contiguous amount of time the heating element 140 can be in use for one inhalation (i.e., draw, usage, puff) of the device in order to protect the diluted nicotine solution 112 and heating element 140 from overheating and releasing toxic substances from the nicotine solution (e.g., formaldehyde). While the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 may be an electronic cigarette including the reservoir 110 for storing a diluted nicotine solution 112, in another exemplary embodiment the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 may be any other vaporizing device configured to deliver any vaporized solution (with or without nicotine). In yet another exemplary embodiment, the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 may be a tobacco furnace including a nicotine cartridge (for example, a cartridge containing tobacco and a filter) in addition to or instead of the reservoir 110 for storing the diluted nicotine solution 112. The reservoir 110 may be refillable or disposable. The power source 120 may be a battery, a fuel injector, or any other device configured to supply power to the heating element 140. The power source 120 may be rechargeable or disposable. The reservoir 110 may be removably connected to the power source 120 or the reservoir 110 and the power source 120 may be integrated into a single device. The processor 130 may be incorporated as part of the power source 120, the reservoir 110 or as a separate, removably connectable device. FIG. 2 illustrates a nicotine dosage sensor 200 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The nicotine dosage sensor 200 includes a processor 230 similar to the processor 130 illustrated in FIG. 1 and memory 240. The electronic nicotine delivery device 100 or the nicotine dosage sensor 200 may also include a timer 250, an inhalation sensor 260, an air flow sensor 270, and/or a heating element sensor 280. The memory 240 may include a solution profile 242 and a device profile 244. The processor 230 may be an integrated circuit or soft logic processor. The memory 240 may be any non-transitory computer-readable storage medium, such flash memory, configured to store data and instructions that, when executed by the processor 230, carry out relevant portions of the features described herein. The timer 250 may be any device configured to measure time intervals. The timer 250 may be “always on” (real-time clock) and measure time intervals as long as the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 is connected to the power source 120 or the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 may include a switch to connect and disconnect the timer 250 from the power source 120. In either instance, the timer 250 is configured to measure time intervals both during and after an inhalation of the electronic nicotine delivery device 100. The inhalation sensor 260 may be any device configured to determine if a user is actively inhaling the vaporized diluted nicotine solution 112. The inhalation sensor 260 may be configured to detect, for example, the output of the negative pressure switch described above, negative pressure from the user, air flow, flow of the vaporized diluted nicotine solution 112 from the reservoir 110, etc. The air flow may be determined by an optional air pressure sensor 270 (discussed below). The nicotine dosage sensor 200 is configured to determine (i.e., estimate and/or measure) the amount of nicotine consumed by a user based on the nicotine content of the diluted nicotine solution 112, the duration of each inhalation, the time elapsed between inhalations, and information indicative of the temperature of the heating element 140 during each inhalation. The nicotine dosage sensor 200 determines the duration of each inhalation and the time elapsed between inhalations based on the outputs of the timer 250 and the inhalation sensor 260. The nicotine content of the nicotine solution 112 may be pre-determined (for example, by analyzing the nicotine solution 112 with a spectrometer tank) and stored in the memory 240 of as part of the solution profile 242. The solution profile 242 may also include additional information regarding the nicotine solution 112. For example, the solution profile 242 may include the burning point of the nicotine solution (i.e., the temperature at which the solution 112 begins releasing toxic substances to the user). After the heating element 140 is activated during inhalation, the temperature of the heating element 140 rises. Accordingly, the temperature of the heating element 140 is dependent on the length of an inhalation. The relationship between the length of an inhalation and the temperature of the heating element may be pre-determined (for example, by simulating the use of a prototypical electronic nicotine delivery device and measuring the physical characteristics of the device) and stored in the memory 240 as part of the device profile 244. The device profile 244 may be determined, for example, by placing the a prototypical electronic nicotine delivery device (e.g., the same model as the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 that includes the nicotine dosage sensor 200) in a simulated puffing device, activating the prototypical electronic nicotine delivery device for a series of successive durations and measuring the temperature of the heating element 140. The device profile 244 may also include addition information regarding the electronic nicotine delivery device 100. The additional information may be pre-determined using the simulated puffing device in combination with the spectrometer, a gas chromatograph, a volume measurement setup, etc. For example, the device profile 244 may determine if and when the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 reaches the burning point of the solution 112. The temperature of the heating element 140 may also be dependent on the time elapsed between each inhalation. As described above, some devices limit the length of a single inhalation in order to prevent the heating element 140 from overheating and burning the nicotine solution 112. A user, however, may initiate multiple inhalations in quick succession, activating the heating element 140 before it has cooled down after the initial inhalation. Accordingly, the device profile 244 may include a ramp up profile indicative of the temperature of the heating element 140 during ramp up (i.e., the temperature increase of the heating element 140 during inhalation) and a decaying profile indicative of the temperature of the heating element 140 during ramp down (i.e., the temperature decrease of the heating element 140 after the heating element is de-activated). The device profile 244 enables the nicotine dosage sensor 200 to determine the temperature of the heating element 140 during a single inhalation or multiple successive inhalations based on the duration of each inhalation and the time elapsed between inhalations. Instead of relying solely on the device profile 244, the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 may include an optional heating element sensor 280 configured to determine the temperature of the heating element 140. In this instance, the nicotine dosage sensor 200 may determine the temperature of the heating element 140, for example, based on the in-line resistance and voltage of the heating element 140 detected by the heating element sensor 280. The amount of nicotine consumed by a user may also depend on the air flow rate of the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 during each inhalation. The nicotine dosage sensor 200 may estimate the air flow during each inhalation based on information included in the device profile 244. For example, an estimated air flow rate may be pre-determined by simulating the use of a prototypical electronic nicotine delivery device as described above and measuring the air flow of the prototypical device during one or more simulated inhalations. In this example, the nicotine dosage sensor 200 may estimate the air flow during each inhalation, for example, by multiplying the estimated air flow rate by the duration of each inhalation. Alternatively, the nicotine dosage sensor 200 may include an optional air flow sensor 270 configured to determine (i.e., estimate or measure) the air flow or air flow rate of the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 during each inhalation. The air flow sensor 270 may be any device configured to measure or estimate the air flow or air flow rate of the electronic nicotine delivery device 100, including a pressure gauge, a vacuum gauge, a diaphragm, an impeller setup, etc. The nicotine dosage sensor 200 includes formula or look-up table stored in the memory 240 that outputs an amount of nicotine consumed by the user based on the duration of each inhalation or both the duration of each inhalation and the time elapsed between inhalations. As described above, the relationship between the amount of nicotine consumed by a user of the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 and the duration of each inhalation (or both the duration of each inhalation and the time elapsed between inhalations) is determined based on characteristics of the solution 112 stored in the solution profile 242 and characteristics of the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 stored in the device profile 244. In one exemplary embodiment, the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 may be configured to pair with a single diluted nicotine solution 112 (e.g., a single use electronic cigarette, an electronic cigarette with one type of mechanically compatible reservoir 110 pre-filled with a single type of diluted nicotine solution 112, etc.). In this embodiment, the device profile 244 associated with the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 and the solution profile 242 associated with the diluted nicotine solution 112 may be pre-stored in the memory 240 of the nicotine dosage sensor 200 of the electronic nicotine delivery device 100. In another exemplary embodiment, the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 may be configured to pair with a multiple diluted nicotine solutions 112 (e.g., an electronic cigarette with multiple compatible reservoirs 110, a refillable vaporizer, etc.). In this embodiment, the device profile 244 associated with the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 may be pre-stored in the memory 240 and the solution profile 242 may be selected by the user based on the diluted nicotine solution 112 paired with the electronic nicotine delivery device 100. The solution profile 242 associated with the diluted nicotine solution 112 may be downloaded from the internet via an external device (e.g., a computer, a smart phone, etc.), transferred to the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 via a wired connection (e.g., USB) or wireless connection (e.g., Bluetooth), and stored in the memory 240 of the nicotine dosage sensor 200 of the electronic nicotine delivery device 100. The solution profile 242 associated with the diluted nicotine solution 112 may be determined and/or distributed by the manufacturer of the solution 112 or a third party. The amount of nicotine consumed by a user may be further based on the type of nicotine solution 112 (e.g., a vegetable glycerin solution, a propylene glycol solution, etc.). Accordingly, the solution profile 242 may include information indicative of the nicotine solution type and the nicotine dosage sensor 200 may further determine the amount of nicotine consumed by the user based on the nicotine solution type. As described above, continuing to inhale from the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 after the temperature of the heating element 140 has reached the burning point of the nicotine solution 112 may cause the user to ingest potentially toxic substances (e.g., formaldehyde) from the nicotine solution. Conventional electronic nicotine delivery devices may attempt to prevent the burning of a nicotine solution by limiting the duration of a single inhalation. A user, however, may further increase the temperature of a heating element of a conventional electronic nicotine delivery device by initiating multiple successive inhalations. As also described above, the nicotine dosage sensor 200 of the present invention may be configured to determine the temperature of the heating element 140 and the solution profile 242 may include information indicative of the boiling point of the nicotine solution 112. Therefore, the nicotine dosage sensor 200 may be further configured to prevent the heating element 140 from boiling the nicotine solution 112 (even when the user initiates successive inhalations) by comparing the temperature of the heating element 140 (as determined by the nicotine dosage sensor 200) and the boiling point of the nicotine solution 112 and outputting a signal if the temperature of the heating element 140 is approaching or exceeds the boiling point of the nicotine solution 112. The electronic nicotine delivery device 100 may be configured to prevent the heating element 140 from approaching or exceeding the boiling point of the nicotine solution 112 (e.g., by disconnecting the heating element 140 from the power source 120) and/or output an audible or visual warning (e.g., via an LED or speaker) to the user if the temperature of the heating element 140 is approaching or exceeds the boiling point of the nicotine solution 112. The nicotine dosage sensor 200 may be further configured to determine (i.e., estimate or measure) the nicotine or cotinine levels of a user. Because nicotine is metabolized primarily by liver enzymes, the nicotine or cotinine levels of a user may be further based on the liver performance of the user. Accordingly, the nicotine dosage sensor 200 may be further configured to estimate the liver performance of the user based on static and/or dynamic biometrics of the user. The static biometrics of the user may include the body weight of the user (which may be used as an estimate of liver mass) and/or the sex, age, height, weight, and/or body type of the user (which may be used as an estimate of liver performance). The static biometrics of the user may also include the user's average water/fluid intake, sampled cotinine levels, sampled hormone levels, etc. The static biometrics of the user may be input into an external device (e.g., a computer, a smart phone, etc.), transferred to the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 via a wired connection (e.g., USB) or wireless connection (e.g., Bluetooth), and stored in the memory 240 of the nicotine dosage sensor 200 of the electronic nicotine delivery device 100. The dynamic biometrics of the user may include the metabolic rate of the user. The user's metabolic rate may be determined by an external device (e.g., a fitness tracker, a fitness watch, etc.) and transferred to and stored by the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 as described above. The dynamic biometrics of the user may also include hydration of the user. The user's hydration may be similarly determined by an external device and transferred to and stored by the electronic nicotine delivery device 100. Alternatively, the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 may include a hydration sensor. For example, the hydration sensor may be located on the exterior surface of the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 and may determine the bioelectrical impedance of the user based on contact with the user's fingers or mouth. In this instance, the nicotine dosage sensor 200 may estimate the user's hydration based on the bioelectrical impedance of the user. The timer 250, the inhalation sensor 260, the air flow sensor 270, and/or the heating element sensor 280 may be incorporated with or distinct from the nicotine dosage sensor 200 and/or the electronic nicotine delivery device 100. As described above, the nicotine dosage sensor 200 may be integrated with the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 and may be configured to receive static and/or dynamic biometrics of the user from an external device. Alternatively, the nicotine dosage sensor 200 may be stored and executed by an external device configured to receive the duration of each inhalation, the time between inhalations, and/or the bioelectrical impedance of the user from the electronic nicotine delivery device 100. The ramp up profile and the decaying profile of the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 may change over time. For example, the heating element 140 may oxidize or the output of the power supply 120 may change. Accordingly, the nicotine dosage sensor 200 may be configured to update the device profile 244 to account for the changing characteristics of the electronic nicotine delivery device 100. For example, the nicotine dosage sensor 200 may be configured to receive measurements or estimates of the nicotine or cotinine levels of a user (e.g., from an external device as described above) and update the device profile 244 based on the measured or estimated nicotine or cotinine levels of a user in order to more accurately determine the amount of nicotine consumed by a user and/or the nicotine or cotinine levels of the user. The nicotine dosage sensor 200 may be configured to output the nicotine consumption information or user nicotine or cotinine levels to the user in the form of visual or audible notification (for example, using an LED, a display, or a speaker). The nicotine dosage sensor 200 may also be configured to output the nicotine consumption information and/or the user nicotine or cotinine levels to an external device (e.g., a computer, a smart phone, a fitness tracker, a fitness watch, etc.). FIG. 3 illustrates an electronic nicotine delivery device 300 according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Similar to the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 illustrated in FIG. 1, the electronic nicotine delivery device 300 may include a reservoir 110, nicotine solution 112, and a power source 120. The electronic nicotine delivery device 300 may also include the nicotine dosage sensor 200 illustrated in FIG. 2 as well as the timer 250, the inhalation sensor 260, the air flow sensor 270, and/or the heating element sensor 280. The electronic nicotine delivery device 300 may also include visual indicators 310, 320, and 330 configured to output the nicotine consumption information or user nicotine or cotinine levels described above. The visual indicators 310, 320, and 330 may be, for example, light emitting diodes (LEDs) or any other suitable device configured to selectively emit light. The visual indicators 310, 320, and 330 may also be, for example, portions of an electronic paper display (e.g., an electrophoretic display, an electro-wetting display, an electrofluidic display, an interferometric modulator, etc.) or any other suitable device configured to selectively reflect light. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 3, a plurality of visual indicators 310 emit or reflect light proportional to the nicotine consumption over a predetermined time period or user nicotine or cotinine levels. The visual indicators 310 may emit or reflect light proportional to the amount of nicotine consumed over the past 24 hours, the amount of nicotine consumed during the current session, the estimated current plasma levels of a user, or the estimated average plasma levels of a user over the last 24 hours. The visual indicator 320 may indicate that a target minimum amount of nicotine (for example, 0 mg) has been consumed over the last 24 hours. The visual indicator 330 may indicate that a predetermined maximum amount of nicotine (for example, 30 mg) has been consumed over the last 24 hours. FIG. 4 illustrates an electronic nicotine delivery device 400 according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Similar to the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 illustrated in FIG. 1, the electronic nicotine delivery device 400 may include a reservoir 110, nicotine solution 112, and a power source 120. The electronic nicotine delivery device 400 may also include the nicotine dosage sensor 200 illustrated in FIG. 2 as well as the timer 250, the inhalation sensor 260, the air flow sensor 270, and/or the heating element sensor 280. The electronic nicotine delivery device 400 may also include visual indicators 4101-410n that mimic the nicotine consumption (or user nicotine or cotinine levels) of a traditional cigarette. Similar to the visual indicators 310, 320, and 330, the visual indicators 4101-410n may be any suitable device configured to selectively emit or reflect light. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 4, the visual indicators 4101-410n emit or reflect light in succession as nicotine is consumed. As shown, visual indicator 420 emits or reflects light while the other visual indicators 4101-410n are off. The visual indicators 4101-410n may be configured to output nicotine consumption information proportional to the nicotine included in a traditional cigarette. For example, visual indicator 4101 may output a visual indication at the start of a smoking session. Visual indicators 4102-410n may emit or reflect light in succession as the user continues to use the electronic nicotine delivery device 400. The visual indicator 410n may emit or reflect light when the nicotine dosage sensor estimates that the amount of nicotine consumed by the user is equivalent to the amount of nicotine in a tradition cigarette. Alternatively, the output of the visual indicators 4101-410n may be proportional to another pre-determined maximum nicotine consumption or user nicotine or cotinine level. The user nicotine or cotinine level may be based on an estimated current level and an estimated average level over a specified time period. The electronic nicotine delivery device 400 may audibly (e.g., via an optional speaker) or visually (e.g., via the visual indicators 4101-410n) alert the user nicotine or cotinine level has fallen beneath a target threshold to notify the user when the user may resume using the electronic nicotine delivery device 400. The nicotine consumption sensor 200 may limit the amount of nicotine consumed over time. For example, the heating element may be configured to remain unheated if the user has reached or exceeded a predetermined maximum nicotine consumption level in a given time period (for example, a usage session, a daily limit, or any other measure of time) or a predetermined maximum user nicotine or cotinine level. Alternatively, the heating element may be configured to output a reduced amount of heat if the user has reached or exceeded the predetermined maximum nicotine consumption level in the given time period or the predetermined maximum user nicotine or cotinine level. The predetermined maximum nicotine consumption level or the user nicotine or cotinine level may be user adjustable. FIG. 5 illustrates an electronic nicotine delivery device 500 according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Similar to the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 illustrated in FIG. 1, the electronic nicotine delivery device 500 may include a reservoir 110, nicotine solution 112, and a power source 120. The electronic nicotine delivery device 500 may also include the nicotine dosage sensor 200 illustrated in FIG. 2 as well as the timer 250, the inhalation sensor 260, the air flow sensor 270, and/or the heating element sensor 280. The electronic nicotine delivery device 500 may also include one or more user input devices 510 and 520 configured to adjust the predetermined maximum nicotine consumption or user nicotine or cotinine level. The user input devices 510 and 520 may be, for example, dials or switches connected to a variable resistor. The nicotine dosage sensor 200 may adjust the predetermined maximum nicotine consumption or user nicotine or cotinine level based on the location of the user input devices 510 and 520. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 5, the user input device 510 may be used to adjust the predetermined maximum nicotine consumption for one session while the user input device 520 may be used to adjust a the predetermined maximum nicotine consumption for one rolling 24 hour period. The user input devices 510 and 520 and nicotine dosage sensor 200 may be calibrated such that user input devices 510 and 520 are aligned with visual indicators such as hash marks 512 and 522. The number of user input devices and the degree of freedom available for each user input device may be constrained by the size of the electronic nicotine delivery device 500. Alternatively, the predetermined maximum nicotine consumption or user nicotine or cotinine levels may be preprogrammed or adjustable by a user through an external device in communication with the electronic nicotine delivery device 500 wireless or wired connection as described above. Alternatively, the electronic nicotine delivery device 500 may include user input devices similar to user input devices 510 and 520 that allow a user to input one or more user biometrics. For example, the electronic nicotine delivery device may include a user input device that allows a user to input the user's weight. The electronic nicotine delivery device may include one or more alternate reservoirs that may include a reduced concentration of nicotine solution 112 (either in addition to the reservoir 110 or in a separate portion of the reservoir 110). The alternate reservoir may enable a user to manually switch to a reduced concentration of nicotine solution. Alternatively, the electronic nicotine delivery device may automatically vaporize the reduced concentration nicotine solution 112 in response to a determination by the nicotine dosage sensor 200 that the user has consumed a predetermined maximum nicotine amount. FIG. 6 illustrates an electronic nicotine delivery device 600 according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The electronic nicotine delivery device 600 may include a power source 120 (similar to the electronic nicotine delivery device 100 illustrated in FIG. 1) and the nicotine dosage sensor 200 illustrated in FIG. 2 as well as the timer 250, the inhalation sensor 260, the air flow sensor 270, and/or the heating element sensor 280. The electronic nicotine delivery device 600 may also include reservoirs 610, 612, and 614, for containing solution with three distinct concentrations of nicotine. For example, the reservoir 610 may include the highest concentration of nicotine, reservoir 612 may include a reduced-concentration solution, and the reservoir 614 (on the back side of the electronic nicotine delivery device 600 relative to the viewer) may include a solution with no nicotine. The electronic nicotine delivery device 600 may be configured to vaporize the solution in reservoir 612 until the user has reached or exceeded the predetermined nicotine consumption target in a given time period, and then vaporize the reduced-concentrated nicotine solution (for example, by an alternate heating element and/or a reservoir injection system) in reservoir 614 until nicotine consumption levels are reduced below the target level (or another pre-defined level of nicotine consumption). The electronic nicotine delivery device 600 may also be configured to vaporize the solution in reservoir 614 if the user has reached or exceeded a second predetermined nicotine consumption target in a given time period. Alternatively, the electronic nicotine delivery device 600 may include an on-demand solution mixing device for electromechanically mixing pure nicotine and solvents in a reservoir or directly into the heating element in order to providing a reduced-concentration nicotine solution 112. In each of the exemplary embodiments described above, the electronic nicotine delivery device 300-600 in conjunction with the nicotine dosage sensor 200 may be used as a smoking cessation device. In some instances, the simple act of informing the user regarding nicotine consumption or user nicotine or cotinine levels may reduce nicotine consumption. In other instances, the user may be restricted from exceeding a predetermined maximum nicotine consumption or user nicotine or cotinine level. The nicotine dosage sensor 200 may be configured to reduce the predetermined maximum nicotine consumption or user nicotine or cotinine level over a large time window (for example, days, weeks, months, etc.). The nicotine dosage sensor 200 may be configured to account for human models of withdrawal. For instance, the nicotine dosage sensor 200 may allow for high impulses upon wake and then further tapering throughout wakeful hours. Alternatively, the nicotine dosage sensor 200 may be configured to mimic traditional cigarette profiles. For example, a user may prefer a nicotine consumption limit equivalent to one pack of traditional cigarettes per day, spaced out into 20 equal doses equivalent to one traditional cigarette each. While exemplary embodiments have been set forth above, those skilled in the art who have reviewed the present disclosure will readily appreciate that other embodiments can be realized within the scope of the invention. For example, while this disclosure describes regulating five distinct measures of nicotine consumption with respect to time (peak nicotine plasma levels, average nicotine plasma levels, cumulative nicotine consumption over a sliding window, cotinine levels over a sliding window, and nicotine consumption per session) it is to be understood that other metrics are simply reconfiguration of the same logic (programmable variants) and should be encompassed by this application.
