The present invention is directed to a composition comprising carbohydrates obtainable from carob and carbohydrates obtainable from at least one further fruit. The use of natural fruit-derived products has become more important in recent years in view of increasing health consciousness. In order to contribute to the human health it is desirable that foodstuff has a low glycaemic index (GI) within a balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle. The GI was first introduced in 1981 and is a classification of the blood glucose raising potential of carbohydrate foods. It is defined as the incremental area under the blood glucose curve of a 50 g carbohydrate portion of a test food expressed as a percentage of the response to 50 g of a reference food taken by the same subject on a different day. Carbohydrate foods consumed in isoglucidic amounts produce different glycaemic responses depending on many factors, such as particle size, cooking and food processing, other food components (e.g., fat, protein, dietary fibre) and starch structure. The principle is that the slower the rate of carbohydrate absorption, the lower the rise of blood glucose level and the lower the GI value. High-GI foods are characterised by fast-release carbohydrate and higher blood glucose levels. A GI value ≧70 is considered high, a GI value 56-69 inclusive is medium and a GI value ≦55 is low (where glucose=100). The GI of foods has important implications for the prevention and treatment of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in Western countries, including Type 2 Diabetes, cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, obesity, and hyperlipidemia. In addition, low GI foods have been associated with prolonged endurance during physical activity, improved insulin sensitivity and increase in colonic fermentation. The problem underlying the present invention is to provide a composition allowing the preparation of foodstuff having a low GI and a pleasant taste. Said problem is solved by a composition, comprising carbohydrates obtainable from carob and carbohydrates obtainable from at least one further fruit. In a preferred embodiment the further fruit is a Mediterranean fruit.

For the purposes of this invention, the term “extracting” is meant to comprise any separation method from a solid or liquid mixture whether it is conducted with or without a solvent. For the purposes of this invention, the ultrafiltration, the ion exchange and the absorption (decolouring) chromatography in the process for the preparation of the composition can be performed as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,709,527. The so-called refining is an important step in the preparation of the composition of the invention. The refining process enables the removal of essentially all the characteristic substances from the mentioned fruit sources except the sugar and the polyalcohol species (target). The process for preparing the composition does not involve an enzymatic or chemical step for converting carbohydrates such as oligosaccharides or polysaccharides (e.g., starch, hemicellulose, pectins) to mono- or di-saccharides or the corresponding carbohydrate monomeric units. The composition can be used for the preparation of foodstuff, in particular a beverage, confectionery, bakery product, dairy product, ice cream or chocolate. The composition of the invention is preferably used for the manufacture of a soft-drink, a juice beverage, a nectar, a dairy product (e.g., a whey product or a yogurt, such as a fruit yogurt or a drink yogurt), a bakery product (e.g., a cookie, a muffin, a cereal bar, a fruit bar, or a cereal breakfast coating), a confectionery (e.g., a jelly, a soft candy, a pectin-jelly candy, or a hard-boiled candy), an ice cream, or chocolate (e.g., a chocolate bar or a chocolate sauce).

The composition of the invention represents a semi-finished product and allows for the preparation of low GI foodstuff. The composition of the invention significantly helps to reduce the GI of the foodstuff. However, since the GI of the final product may be altered by further ingredients, the final product will not necessarily have a low GI. In a further embodiment the invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the composition of the invention. The composition of the invention is preferably used for the prevention or treatment of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, obesity or hyperlipidemia. The composition of the invention has been subjected to GI—clinical tests in several specialised centres (e.g., Oxford Brookes University, Profil Institute Neuss, Freiburg University) in order to determine its GI and the GI of some foodstuff applications. These tests indicated a GI ranging from 34 to 42, depending on the used fruit percentage of the formula. The tests were performed following an official method specified by the FAO/WHO (“Carbohydrates in Human Nutrition”. FAO Food and Nutrition Paper 66. Report of a Joint FAO/WHO Expert Consultation. FAO, Rome 1998). The clinical tests show that the composition of the invention is suitable for treating or preventing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease, obesity or hyperlipidemia. In beverage/drink applications the GI as determined by the clinical tests ranged from 34 to 54, depending on the recipe. These results were obtained for applications wherein the composition of the invention was used together with other food ingredients, even if other carbohydrate sources (e.g. fruit juice concentrates) were used. In all cases the obtained GIs were classified as low. Thus, the composition of the invention significantly lowers the GI of foodstuff when it is applied in foodstuff, in comparison with the same foodstuff formulated and prepared by using regular sugar sources (e.g., glucose syrup, crystal sugar-sucrose). The composition allows for the preparation of foodstuff with surprisingly low GI. A beverage/drink application having a GI of 34 can be prepared for example from a composition comprising 40% (w/w) carbohydrates obtainable from carob, 45% (w/w) carbohydrates obtainable from apple, and 15% (w/w) carbohydrates obtainable from grape, wherein the percentages are based on the dry matter. A beverage/drink application having a GI of 42 can be prepared for example from a composition comprising 35% (w/w) carbohydrates obtainable from carob, 40% (w/w) carbohydrates obtainable from apple, 10% (w/w) carbohydrates obtainable from grape, 10% (w/w) carbohydrates obtainable from pear, 2% (w/w) carbohydrates obtainable from peach, 2% (w/w) carbohydrates obtainable from orange, and 1% (w/w) carbohydrates obtainable from lemon, wherein the percentages are based on the dry matter. The composition can replace completely or partially the used regular sugars in food applications (e.g., crystal sugar or saccharose, fructose syrup, glucose-fructose syrups, glucose syrups). Drinks/beverages prepared from the composition of the invention are preferably diluted for human consumption until the proper dilution factor based on the desired sweetening strength and/or sensorial targets (e.g., with water, fruit juices, or other liquid ingredients). In case of other food systems (e.g., confectionery, bakery, dairy, ice cream, chocolate), the composition of the invention can be applied directly (in concentrate form) or blended with other characteristic ingredients of the specific food application during the process. In all the cases, the dosage depends on the required sweetening strength/profile or the targeted final taste. The composition of the invention has a well-balanced sweet taste and a particular mouth-feel. Further, the taste is weakly fruity and full-bodied compared with regular sugars used in the food industry (e.g., crystal sugar, glucose syrup, invert sugar syrup, fructose syrup). The composition of the invention is free of odour and colour. The production process of the fruit extracts and the composition of the invention will be described in the following with reference to preferred embodiments. A. Description of preferred production process of fruit extracts of carob and orangeB. Description of preferred production process of the composition of the invention from mixed fruit extracts In the following the preferred steps of preparing the claimed composition are described in more detail. A.—Fruit Extracts All the material and technological aids used are strictly “food grade” approved. A.1.

The seedless carob pulp has preferably an average particle size of 10-20 mm and a moisture content of 5-15%. The average composition of the seedless carob pulp is as follows: Fats (%) 0.14Proteins (%) 3-4Soluble Carbohydrates (%) 40-50Hemicelluloses (%) 17-19Lignine (%) 18-20Celluloses (%) 8-10Ash (%) 2-3Tannins (Polyphenols) (%) 1-3Magnesium (ppm) 225-250Calcium (ppm) 2800-3000Potassium (ppm) The percentages are expressed in weight of the dry matter. A.1.2 Extraction For the purposes of this invention, the carob can be extracted as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,624,500. The content of soluble solids expressed as ° Brix ranges preferably from about 16-22° Brix in the obtained raw carob extract. The regular pH of the raw carob extract is preferably between 4.6-5.8. A.1.3 Decantation—Centrifugation By using decanters (first) and vertical centrifuges (second), the content of initial insoluble solids of the raw carob extract is preferably reduced until less than 0.8% (v/v). A.1.4 Pasteurisation Micro-stability and inactivation of endogenous enzymes are the main targets of this step. It is preferably achieved in a regular plate-heat exchanger pasteurisation unit with the following thermal parameters: Temperature: 85+/−2° C.Time: minimum 20 seconds. Once the raw carob extract has been pasteurised, it is preferably rapidly chilled until 15-20° C.

The maximum working temperature of the filtration system is preferably below 40° C. on the product. The U-F permits obtaining a clear-brilliant-transparent clear carob extract, with dark brownish colour and typical carob odour. The normal content of soluble solids of this clear liquid fraction ranges preferably from 14-20° Brix. The permeate—clear carob extract (14-20° Brix) is preferably stored in tanks for being mixed with clear fruit juice concentrate and/or a clear orange extract concentrate (produced according to chapter A.2).

The orange pulp is preferably initially checked in terms of moisture/humidity (average: 75-85% humidity) and sound aspect (e.g., free of non-orange material, no fermented pulp, typical fresh orange pulp odour). A.2.2 Milling—Grinding The orange pulp is preferably transported through screw-conveyors for feeding two hammer-mill equipments which are crushing, grinding and sieving the orange pulp until a regular particle size of 2-3 mm is achieved.
