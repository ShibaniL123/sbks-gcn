(91-2) Synthesis of (S)-3-chloro-N-(2-hydroxy-1-[3- {4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl}-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]ethyl)benzenesulfonamide (Compound 91)
A solution (500 Âµl) of 1 mol/L tetrabutylammonium fluoride in tetrahydrofuran was added to a solution of N-{2-[(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy]-1-{3-[4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl}ethyl}-3-chlorobenzene-1-sulfonamide (114 mg, 0.2 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (4 mL), and the mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. Thereafter, water was added to stop the reaction, and the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The extracts were mixed, washed with saturated brine, and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated off under reduced pressure, and the obtained residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane-ethyl acetate) followed by recrystallization to obtain the title compound 51 mg (yield 55%).
