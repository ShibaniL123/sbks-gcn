BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Technical Field The present invention relates to immunotherapies that are based on B cell depletion. In particular, the present invention relates to CD37 antibody molecules, especially A2 and B2, for use in such therapies, e.g. in the treatment of B cell malignancies and autoimmune conditions. 2. Background Immunotherapy using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been emerging as a safe and selective method for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. In particular, the role of monoclonal antibodies in therapies that are based on B cell depletion, e.g. in the treatment of B cell malignancies, has expanded since the introduction of rituximab (Rituxan®), an antibody that is directed against the CD20 antigen on the B cell surface. Numerous studies have confirmed the efficacy of rituximab as a single agent and in combination therapy in low-grade NHL (Hiddemann W, et al. Frontline therapy with rituximab added to the combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) significantly improves the outcome for patients with advanced-stage follicular lymphoma compared with therapy with CHOP alone: results of a prospective randomized study of the German Low-Grade Lymphoma Study. Group. Blood 2005; 106: 3725-3732 (2005)), mantle cell lymphoma (Forstpointner R, et al. The addition of rituximab to a combination of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone (FCM) significantly increases the response rate and prolongs survival as compared with FCM alone in patients with relapsed and refractory follicular and mantle cell lymphomas: results of a prospective randomized study of the German Low-Grade Lymphoma Study Group. Blood, 2004; 104: 3064-3071.), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (Coiffier B, et al. Rituximab (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody) for the treatment of patients with relapsing or refractory aggressive lymphoma: a multicenter phase II study. Blood 1998; 92: 1927-1932), and Burkitt lymphoma (Thomas D A, et al. Chemoimmunotherapy with hyper-CVAD plus rituximab for the treatment of adult Burkitt and Burkitt-type lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Cancer 2006; 106: 1569-1580). However, only a subset of patients responds to therapy and the majority of those eventually relapse following rituximab treatment. Therefore, there is a need to find immunotherapies with higher efficacy than rituximab, especially with higher efficacy for those subsets of patients that respond poorly to rituximab treatment. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention describes CD37 antibodies, especially A2 and B2, for the treatment of patients with CLL, especially of patients belonging to a “high risk” group of patients. Those patients are either patients who are refractory to fludarabine treatment or patients who carry a genetic marker which is indicative for poor prognosis or increased risk of treatment failure, e.g. patients with TP53 mutation or deletion of chromosome 17p13. Antibodies A2 and B2 are tested in whole blood samples from CLL patients with respect to their ability to deplete malignant CLL cells. Rituximab, a CD20 antibody and alemtuzumab, a CD52 antibody are tested in parallel as comparator antibodies. Both A2 and B2 mediate a high degree of CLL cell depletion in these samples which is clearly superior to that of the CD20 antibody rituximab and the CD52 antibody alemtuzumab. A series of 21 blood samples derived from different patients is characterized according to their genetic status and response to fludarabine treatment (after clinical exposure and in vitro testing). Subset analysis of these patients reveals that the superior CLL depleting activity of A2 and B2 is present in all subsets analyzed. In particular, A2 and B2 are superior to rituximab and alemtuzumab in “high risk” patients that carry a deletion in chromosome 17p13, a TP53 mutation or are refractory to fludarabine treatment. Furthermore the CLL depleting effect of A2 and B2 is outstanding in normal risk patients as well as in “high risk” patients, indicating that the superior CLL depleting activity of CD37 antibodies, especially A2 and B2, is not restricted to patients with normal risk for treatment failure but applies particularly to patients bearing an increased risk for treatment failure. In contrast to the standard treatment CD37 antibodies, especially A2 and B2 show excellent CLL depleting activity across different CLL patient subgroups in vitro which is surprisingly clearly superior to approved antibodies rituximab and alemtuzumab. Up to this point the only experimental data available for targeting CD37 on primary CLL cells in vitro indicate that CD37 antibodies or an anti-CD37 SMIP molecule are able to induce apoptosis and ADCC on primary CLL cells, however there is no evidence that CLL cell depletion in whole blood assays in vitro is observed (Zhao X B, Lapalombella R, Joshi T, Cheney C, Gowda A, Hayden-Ledbetter M S, Baum P R, Lin T S, Jarjoura D, Lehman A, Kussewitt D, Lee R J, Caligiuri M A, Tridandapani S, Muthusamy N, Byrd J C. Targeting CD37+ lymphoid malignancies with a novel engineered small modular immunopharmaceutical 2007; BLOOD, 1 Oct. 2007, VOLUME 110, NUMBER 7, Epub ahead of print. Blood. 2007 Apr. 17). Furthermore, there is no evidence that CLL cell depletion in patient derived blood samples using a CD37 antibody is superior to that of using other B cell directed antibodies. In recent publications by Zenz et al. (Abstract 2379, ASH 2009, New Orleans) and Platz et al. (Abstract 2365, ASH 2009, New Orleans) the efficacy of rituximab and the Fc-engineered novel CD20 antibody GA101 is tested in blood samples from CLL patients in a comparable assay format. The results disclosed in these presentations indicate that the novel Fc-engineered CD20 antibody GA101 is superior to rituximab, however the maximum observed effect of GA101 is clearly lower than that observed with A2 and B2. Hence, it is unexpected that a Fc-engineered CD37 antibody shows an activity that is even superior to that of a Fc-engineered CD20 antibody. Advantages A high degree of CLL cell depletion in patients with CLL is considered advantageous for the treatment of CLL patients and is considered to translate into increased clinical benefit for patients treated with such an agent. Antibodies A2 and B2 display such a high degree of CLL cell depletion in whole blood assays which is superior to the effect of the CD20 antibodies rituximab (see data disclosed in this application) and GA101 (Zenz et al., 2009, Abstract 2379, ASH 2009, New Orleans). This superior efficacy of A2 and B2 is especially evident in patient samples which are derived from patients belonging to high risk groups, e.g. patients who are refractory to fludarabine or who carry genetic markers (e.g. TP53 mutation or 17p13 deletion) which are predictive for poor treatment outcome using current standard therapies (e.g. therapies combining a CD20 antibody with a fludarabine containing chemotherapy regimen). In addition, patients who failed previous anti-CD20 treatment are in need for improved treatment modalities. Therefore application of a CD20 unrelated treatment modality (e.g. antibodies specific for CD37, especially A2 and B2) is expected to provide an improved treatment for patients suffering from CLL, especially patients who belong to a high risk group of patients. The ability of CD37 antibodies, especially A2 and B2, to deplete CLL cells is high both in patient samples derived from patients with normal risk and with increased risk (“high risk” or “ultra-high risk” patients) and is clearly superior to that of rituximab and alemtuzumab. Applicability and Methods of Therapeutic Use In accordance with the invention, there are provided novel indications of using CD37 antibodies as described in the present invention. Accordingly, the CD37 antibodies of the present invention may be used to treat “high risk” or “ultra high risk” patients suffering from B cell malignancies. To be used in therapy, the CD37 antibody is included into pharmaceutical compositions appropriate to facilitate administration to animals or humans. Typical formulations of the CD37 antibody molecule can be prepared by mixing the CD37 antibody molecule with physiologically acceptable carriers, excipients or stabilizers, in the form of lyophilized or otherwise dried formulations or aqueous solutions or aqueous or non-aqueous suspensions. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and adjuvants for use with CD37 antibodies according to the present invention include, for example, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, buffer substances, water, salts or electrolytes and cellulose-based substances. Carriers, excipients, modifiers or stabilizers are nontoxic at the dosages and concentrations employed. They include buffer systems such as phosphate, citrate, acetate and other anorganic or organic acids and their salts; antioxidants including ascorbic acid and methionine; preservatives (such as octadecyldimethylbenzyl ammonium chloride; hexamethonium chloride; benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride; phenol, butyl or benzyl alcohol; alkyl parabens such as methyl or propyl paraben; catechol; resorcinol; cyclohexanol; 3-pentanol; and m-cresol); proteins, such as serum albumin, gelatin, or immunoglobulins; hydrophilic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone or polyethylene glycol (PEG); amino acids such as glycine, glutamine, asparagine, histidine, arginine, or lysine; monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides or polysaccharides and other carbohydrates including glucose, mannose, sucrose, trehalose, dextrins or dextrans; chelating agents such as EDTA; sugar alcohols such as, mannitol or sorbitol; salt-forming counter-ions such as sodium; metal complexes (e.g. Zn-protein complexes); and/or ionic or non-ionic surfactants such as TWEEN™ (polysorbates), PLURONICS™ or fatty acid esters, fatty acid ethers or sugar esters. Also organic solvents can be contained in the antibody formulation such as ethanol or isopropanol. The excipients may also have a release-modifying or absorption-modifying function. This is not a complete list of possible pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and adjuvants, and one of ordinary skilled in the art would know other possibilities, which are replete in the art. The CD37 antibody molecules may also be dried (freeze-dried, spray-dried, spray-freeze dried, dried by near or supercritical gases, vacuum dried, air-dried), precipitated or crystallized or entrapped in microcapsules that are prepared, for example, by coacervation techniques or by interfacial polymerization using, for example, hydroxymethylcellulose or gelatin and poly-(methylmethacylate), respectively, in colloidal drug delivery systems (for example, liposomes, albumin microspheres, microemulsions, nano-particles and nanocapsules), in macroemulsions or precipitated or immobilized onto carriers or surfaces, for example by pcmc technology (protein coated microcrystals). Such techniques are known in the art. Naturally, the pharmaceutical compositions/formulations to be used for in vivo administration must be sterile; sterilization may be accomplished be conventional techniques, e.g. by filtration through sterile filtration membranes. It may be useful to increase the concentration of the CD37 antibody to come to a so-called high concentration liquid formulation (HCLF); various ways to generate such HCLFs have been described. The CD37 antibody molecule may also be contained in a sustained-release preparation. Such preparations include solid, semi-solid or liquid matrices of hydrophobic or hydrophilic polymers, and may be in the form of shaped articles, e.g. films, sticks or microcapsules and may be applied via an application device. Examples of sustained-release matrices include polyesters, hydrogels (for example, poly(2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate) or sucrose acetate butyrate), or poly(vinylalcohol)), polylactides (U.S. Pat. No. 3,773,919), copolymers of L-glutamic acid and γ ethyl-L-glutamate, non-degradable ethylene-vinyl acetate, degradable lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymers such as the LUPRON DEPOT™ (injectable microspheres composed of lactic acid-glycolic acid copolymer and leuprolide acetate), and poly-D-(−)-3-hydroxybutyric acid. While polymers such as ethylene-vinyl acetate and lactic acid-glycolic acid enable release of molecules for over 100 days, certain hydrogels release proteins for shorter time periods. When encapsulated antibodies remain in the body for a long time, they may denature or aggregate as a result of exposure to moisture at 37° C., resulting in a loss of biological activity and possible changes in immunogenicity. Rational strategies can be devised for stabilization depending on the mechanism involved. For example, if the aggregation mechanism is discovered to be intermolecular S—S bond formation through thio-disulfide interchange, stabilization may be achieved by modifying sulfhydryl residues, lyophilization from acidic solutions, controlling moisture content, using appropriate additives, and developing specific polymer matrix compositions. The CD37 antibody molecule, especially A2 and B2, can be incorporated also in other application forms, such as dispersions, suspensions or liposomes, tablets, capsules, powders, sprays, transdermal or intradermal patches or creams with or without permeation enhancing devices, wafers, nasal, buccal or pulmonary formulations, or may be produced by implanted cells or—after gene therapy—by the individual's own cells. A CD37 antibody molecule, especially A2 and B2, may also be derivatized with a chemical group such as polyethylene glycol (PEG), a methyl or ethyl group, or a carbohydrate group. These groups may be useful to improve the biological characteristics of the antibody, e.g. to increase serum half-life or to increase tissue binding. The preferred mode of application is parenteral, by infusion or injection (intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intradermal), but other modes of application such as by inhalation, transdermal, intranasal, buccal, oral, may also be applicable. For therapeutic use, the compounds may be administered in a therapeutically effective amount in any conventional dosage form in any conventional manner. Routes of administration include, but are not limited to, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intrasynovially, by infusion, sublingually, transdermally, orally, topically or by inhalation, tablet, capsule, caplet, liquid, solution, suspension, emulsion, lozenges, syrup, reconstitutable powder, granule, suppository and transdermal patch. Methods for preparing such dosage forms are known (see, for example, H. C. Ansel and N. G. Popovish, Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 5th ed., Lea and Febiger (1990)). A therapeutically effective amount can be determined by a skilled artisan based upon such factors as weight, metabolism, and severity of the affliction etc. Preferably the active compound is dosed at about 1 mg to about 500 mg per kilogram of body weight on a daily basis. More preferably the active compound is dosed at about 1 mg to about 100 mg per kilogram of body weight on a daily basis. For the prevention or treatment of disease, the appropriate dosage of antibody will depend on the type of disease to be treated, the severity and course of the disease, whether the antibody is administered for preventive or therapeutic purposes, previous therapy, the patient's clinical history and response to the antibody, and the discretion of the attending physician. The antibody is suitably administered to the patient at one time or over a series of treatments. Depending on the type and severity of the disease, about 0.01 μg/kg to 40 mg/kg (e.g. 0.1-20 mg/kg) of antibody, especially of A2 and B2, is an initial candidate dosage for administration to the patient, whether, for example, by one or more separate administrations, or by continuous infusion. For repeated administrations over several days or longer, depending on the condition, the treatment is sustained until a desired suppression of disease symptoms occurs. However, other dosage regimens may be useful. The progress of this therapy is easily monitored by conventional techniques and assays, e.g. by determining the extent of B cell depletion (e.g. using flow cytometry). For A2, the estimated weekly dose for a 70 kg human is in the range of 86 to 184 mg. The estimated human weekly dose for B2 for a 70 kg human is 189 to 404 mg. The “therapeutically effective amount” of the antibody to be administered is the minimum amount necessary to prevent, ameliorate, or treat a disease or disorder. B cell malignancies include, without limitation, B cell lymphomas (e.g. various forms of Hodgkin's disease, B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and related lymphomas (e.g. Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia (also called lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma or immunocytoma) or central nervous system lymphomas), leukemias (e.g. acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL; also termed B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia BCLL), hairy cell leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia) and myeloma (e.g. multiple myeloma). Additional B cell malignancies include small lymphocytic lymphoma, B cell prolymphocytic leukemia, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, splenic marginal zone lymphoma, plasma cell myeloma, solitary plasmacytoma of bone, extraosseous plasmacytoma, extra-nodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated (MALT) lymphoid tissue, nodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, mediastinal (thymic) large B cell lymphoma, intravascular large B cell lymphoma, primary effusion lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma/leukemia, grey zone lymphoma, B cell proliferations of uncertain malignant potential, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. The CD37 antibody may be administered alone or in combination with adjuvants that enhance the stability, facilitate administration of pharmaceutic compositions containing them in certain embodiments, provide increased dissolution or dispersion, increase activity, provide adjunct therapy, and the like. Advantageously, such combinations may utilize lower dosages of the active ingredient, thus reducing possible toxicity and adverse side effects. Depending on the disorder to be treated, the CD37 antibody molecule, especially A2 and B2, may be used on its own or in combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents, in particular selected from DNA damaging or tubulin binding agents or therapeutically active compounds that inhibit angiogenesis, signal transduction pathways or mitotic checkpoints in cancer cells. The additional therapeutic agent may be administered simultaneously with, optionally as a component of the same pharmaceutical preparation, or before or after administration of the CD37 antibody molecule, especially A2 and B2.

Both antibodies show effective and concentration-dependent CLL cell depletion in the whole blood assay. As shown in FIG. 1, both A2 and B2 very potently deplete CLL cells with EC50 values of about 1000 ng/ml. The CLL cell depleting effect of A2 and B2 at an antibody concentration of 10 μg/ml is compared to that of rituximab and alemtuzumab at the same antibody concentration after an incubation of the blood samples for 3 hours. As shown in FIG. 2 CLL cell depletion of A2 (9% alive cells) and B2 (26% alive cells) at an antibody concentration of 10 μg/ml is clearly superior to that observed with alemtuzumab (71% alive cells) and rituximab (80% alive cells). Taken together these data clearly demonstrate that antibodies A2 and B2 exert a potent and concentration dependent depletion of CLL cells from whole blood samples in vitro. The degree of CLL cell depletion is clearly superior to that observed with rituximab and alemtuzumab. In a specific embodiment of the present invention the effect of the CD37 antibodies A2 and B2 in cases with genomic aberrations (e.g. TP53 mutation or 17p13 deletion), in fludarabine refractory cases, and in patients with failure of previous anti-CD20 treatment is investigated (FIGS. 3A and 3B). These cases are generally considered as high risk or ultra-high risk patient populations with median survival of around 2 years with current treatment approaches. To this end blood samples from 21 patients are characterized, including 10 patients of the high risk or ultra-high risk group and 11 samples without any particular risk features (FIG. 3B). We compare CLL cell depletion in the high risk group (17p13 deletion, TP53 mutation, fludarabine refractory) and the remaining patients without any particular risk. For both antibodies, A2 and B2, the CLL cell depletion is high in both risk groups, i.e. at 10 μg/ml A2 mean remaining CLL cells: 11.1% (8 h) normal risk versus 21.3% high risk; 10 μg/ml B2 mean remaining CLL cells: 33.2% (8 h) normal risk versus 43.1% high risk (FIG. 3B). In conclusion the CD37 antibodies, especially A2 and B2, show highly effective and potent CLL cell depletion in whole blood samples from CLL patients. This effect is high in all tested patient risk groups, especially blood samples from patients with high risk show a similar high degree of CLL cell depletion as blood samples from normal risk groups. Hence, CD37 antibodies, particularly A2 and B2, are highly effective in all tested CLL samples irrespective of genetic risk and are thus particularly well suited for the treatment of patients with increased risk of treatment failure, so called “high risk” patients or patient populations (e.g. TP53 mutation, 17p13 deletion, fludarabine refractory or failure of anti-CD20 therapy) or “ultra high risk” patients or patient populations. DEFINITIONS The general embodiments “comprising” or “comprised” encompass the more specific embodiment “consisting of”. Furthermore, singular and plural forms are not used in a limiting way. Terms used in the course of this present invention have the following meaning. “CD37”, a member of the tetraspanin superfamily, is a heavily glycosylated cell surface molecule with four transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops. CD37 is predominantly expressed on B cells and B cell malignancies, low level expression of CD37 has been reported on T cells, granulocytes, and monocytes. High levels of CD37 expression have been observed in samples of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and different subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (Schwartz-Albiez et al, Journal Immunol 140: 905-914, 1988; Barrena et al., Leukemia 19: 1376-1383, 2005). This expression pattern makes CD37 an attractive target for antibody-mediated cancer therapy. Binding of a CD37-specific mAb to cancer cells may trigger various mechanisms of action: First, after the antibody binds to the extracellular domain of the CD37 antigen, it may activate the complement cascade and lyse the targeted cell. Second, an anti-CD37 antibody may mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) to the target cell, which occurs after the Fc portion of the bound antibody is recognized by appropriate receptors on cytotoxic cells of the immune system. Third, the antibody may alter the ability of B cells to respond to antigen or other stimuli. Finally, anti-CD37 antibody may initiate programmed cell death (apoptosis). The terms “CD37 antibody”, “CD37 antibody molecule”, “anti-CD37 antibody” and “anti-CD37 antibody molecule” as used in the present invention specifically relate to an antibody with a binding specificity for CD37 antigen. Examples of such antibodies are known in the art and are further described below. The terms “anti-CD37 antibody molecule”, “anti-CD37 antibody”, “CD37 antibody” and “CD37 antibody molecule” are used interchangeably. The term “high risk patient”, or “high risk” patient population means that the life expectancy of this patient group is very short (median of 2-3 years) and the response to current standard treatment is significantly worse than for patients without these high risk features. More specifically this group contains patients with fludarabine refractory disease which means patients who have received fludarabine alone or in combination and have either not responded (failure to achieve partial response or complete response) or have progressed within 6 months after treatment. Furthermore such high risk patients comprise “TP53 dysfunctional” patients and patients having chromosomal aberrations like 17p13 deletion. “TP53 dysfunctional” patient means that patients have impaired function of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 or the p53 protein. This currently relates to inactivation of p53 protein by mutation or to deletion of one copy of the TP53 gene or a combination thereof. Either of these aberrations is associated with refractory CLL, poor response to standard treatment and short progression free survival and overall survival. 17p13 deletion means a deletion of the chromosome 17p13 or parts thereof by genetic events, e.g. genomic instability. The term “ultra-high risk” patient or “ultra-high risk” patient population specifically comprises a group of high risk patients with particular poor prognosis or with a combination of risk factors, e.g. TP53 dysfunction and 17p13 deletion and refractory to fludarabine. Ultra-high risk patients may have a median life expectancy which is below that of high risk patients, e.g. median survival is less than 2 years. Furthermore ultra-high risk patients may be defined as patients who are initially refractory to treatment, e.g. fludarabine refractory. The term “antibody” or “antibodies” comprises monoclonal, polyclonal, multispecific and single chain antibodies and fragments thereof such as for example Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)2, Fc and Fc′ fragments, light (L) and heavy (H) immunoglobulin chains and the constant, variable or hypervariable regions thereof as well as Fv and Fd fragments. The term “antibody” or “antibodies” comprises antibodies of human or non-human origin, humanised as well as chimeric antibodies and furthermore Fc-engineered antibodies or Fc-fusion molecules. Fab fragments (fragment antigen binding=Fab) consist of the variable regions of both chains which are held together by the adjacent constant regions. They may be produced for example from conventional antibodies by treating with a protease such as papain or by DNA cloning. Other antibody fragments are F(ab′)2 fragments which can be produced by proteolytic digestion with pepsin. By gene cloning it is also possible to prepare shortened antibody fragments which consist only of the variable regions of the heavy (VH) and light chain (VL). These are known as Fv fragments (fragment variable=fragment of the variable part). As covalent binding via the cysteine groups of the constant chains is not possible in these Fv fragments, they are often stabilised by some other method. For this purpose the variable regions of the heavy and light chains are often joined together by means of a short peptide fragment of about 10 to 30 amino acids, preferably 15 amino acids. This produces a single polypeptide chain in which VH and VL are joined together by a peptide linker. Such antibody fragments are also referred to as single chain Fv fragments (scFv). Examples of scFv antibodies are known in the art. In past years various strategies have been developed for producing multimeric scFv derivatives. The intention is to produce recombinant antibodies with improved pharmacokinetic properties and increased binding avidity. In order to achieve the multimerisation of the scFv fragments they are produced as fusion proteins with multimerisation domains. The multimerisation domains may be, for example, the CH3 region of an IgG or helix structures (“coiled coil structures”) such as the Leucine Zipper domains. In other strategies the interactions between the VH and VL regions of the scFv fragment are used for multimerisation (e.g. dia, tri- and pentabodies). The term “diabody” is used in the art to denote a bivalent homodimeric scFv derivative. Shortening the peptide linker in the scFv molecule to 5 to 10 amino acids results in the formation of homodimers by superimposing VH/VL chains. The diabodies may additionally be stabilised by inserted disulphite bridges. Examples of diabodies can be found in the literature. The term “minibody” is used in the art to denote a bivalent homodimeric scFv derivative. It consists of a fusion protein which contains the CH3 region of an immunoglobulin, preferably IgG, most preferably IgG1, as dimerisation region. This connects the scFv fragments by means of a hinge region, also of IgG, and a linker region. Examples of such minibodies are known in the art. The term “triabody” is used in the art to denote a trivalent homotrimeric scFv derivative. The direct fusion of VH-VL without the use of a linker sequence leads to the formation of trimers. The fragments known in the art as mini antibodies which have a bi, tri- or tetravalent structure are also derivatives of scFv fragments. The multimerisation is achieved by means of di-, tri- or tetrameric coiled coil structures. There are also “scaffold proteins” or “scaffold antibodies” known in the art. Using this term, a scaffold protein means any functional domain of a protein, especially an antibody, that is coupled by genetic cloning or by co-translational processes with another protein or part of a protein that has another function. The term “Complementary determining region” or “CDR” or “CDRs” of an antibody/antibody molecule means the hypervariable regions (also called Complementarity Determining Regions, abbreviated to “CDRs”) of immunoglobulins. The CDRs were originally defined by Kabat et al., (“Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest” Kabat, E., of al., U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, (1983) and Kabat E. A., Wu T. T., Perry H. M., Gottesman K. S. and Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest (5th Ed.). NIH Publication No. 91-3242. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md. 1991) based on extent of sequence variability of numerous antibody sequences. The CDRs are believed to contact the target antigen of an antibody and to be primarily responsible for binding. Chothia et al (Chothia and Lesk, J. Mol. Biol., 196:901-917 (1987)) have given an alternate definition of the hypervariable regions or CDRs. The Chothia definition is based on the residues that constitute the loops in the 3-dimensional structures of antibodies. In the specific context of the present invention the CDRs are determined on the basis of the Kabat system. From the sequences of the variable regions as shown in SEQ ID NO:2 and SEQ ID NO:4, the CDR sequence can be routinely determined by searching the Kabat sequence database for sequence features. The 3 CDRs contained within the variable heavy chain as shown in SEQ ID NO:2 comprise preferably positions 31-35 (H1, SEQ ID NO: 15), 50-66 (H2, SEQ ID NO: 16) or 50-62 (H2b, SEQ ID NO: 21) and 99-105 (H3, SEQ ID NO: 17), the 3 CDRs contained within the variable light chain as shown in SEQ ID NO:4 comprise preferably positions 24-34 (L1, SEQ ID NO: 18), 50-56 (L2, SEQ ID NO: 19) and 89-97 (L3, SEQ ID NO: 20).

These techniques are fully disclosed in the current literature. All publications and patent applications mentioned in this specification are indicative of the level of skill of those skilled in the art to which this invention pertains. All publications and patent applications cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety in order to more fully describe the state of the art to which this invention pertains. The invention generally described above will be more readily understood by reference to the following examples, which are hereby included merely for the purpose of illustration of certain embodiments of the present invention. The following examples are not limiting. They merely show possible embodiments of the invention. A person skilled in the art could easily adjust the conditions to apply it to other embodiments. Experimental Materials and Methods The CLL cell depleting activity of several antibodies (A2, B2, rituximab, alemtuzumab) is studied in a set of CLL patient blood samples in vitro. CLL samples are characterized with respect to genetics (genomic aberrations, TP53 mutation, 17p13 deletion), as well as clinical course and immunophenotype. TP53 mutation status can be determined by sequencing of the coding exons of the DNA binding domain of p53 (e.g. exons 4-10) or other relevant exons by automated fluorescent sequencing as described by Zenz et al. (Zenz T, Kröber A, Scherer K, Häbe S, Bühler A, Benner A, Denzel T, Winkler D, Edelmann J, Schwänen C, Döhner H, Stilgenbauer S. Monoallelic TP53 inactivation is associated with poor prognosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: results from a detailed genetic characterization with long-term follow-up. Blood. 2008 Oct. 15; 112(8):3322-9. Epub 2008 Aug. 8.) or by other suitable methods known in the art (for example as described in Coll-Mulet et al., Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification for detection of genomic alterations in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia., Br J Haematol. 2008 September; 142(5):793-801. Epub 2008 Jun. 17.). Analysis of genomic aberrations (e.g. deletion of chromosome 17p13) and VH status (e.g. IGVH mutation status) can be performed as described in the literature (e.g. Döhner et al., Genomic aberrations and survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. N Engl J Med. 2000 Dec. 28; 343(26):1910-6; Kröber et al., Additional genetic high-risk features such as 11q deletion, 17p deletion, and V3-21 usage characterize discordance of ZAP-70 and VH mutation status in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. J Clin Oncol. 2006 Feb. 20; 24(6):969-75. Epub 2006 Jan. 17.). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a widely used method known in the art for the detection of genomic aberrations and deletion of chromosomes, e.g. 17p13 deletion (Döhner et al., 11q deletions identify a new subset of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia characterized by extensive nodal involvement and inferior prognosis. Blood. 1997 Apr. 1; 89(7):2516-22.). To study the effect on CLL cells, we assess the CD37 antibodies in parallel with rituximab and alemtuzumab after in vitro treatment in a whole blood culture system. 20 μl of antibody diluted in PBS are added to 180 μl of heparinised or ACD (acid-citrate-dextrose) blood and incubated for 3 h or 8 h at room temperature in an 48-well plate under constant shaking. Thereafter an aliquot of the blood—antibody mixture is transferred into BD TruCount tubes and 20 μl of a FITC-labelled CD19 antibody is added for identification of CLL cells. After lysis of erythrocytes the samples are measured with a FACS Calibur flow cytometry device. Viable CLL cells are determined via their CD19 positivity and appearance in side scatter. Quantification of viable CLL cells is performed by using fluorescently labelled beads as internal standard which are included in known numbers in the TruCount tubes. Concentration response curves are calculated using the GraphPad Prism software package version 5.02. EXAMPLES Example 1 CLL Whole Blood Assay The effect of antibody treatment on CLL cells in whole blood samples derived from CLL patients is assessed with a whole blood assay. Increasing concentrations (0.001 μg/ml to 100 μg/ml) of antibodies A2 and B2 are added to heparinised or acid-citrate-dextrose blood and incubated for 3 hours at room temperature. After antibody incubation the remaining viable CLL cells (CD19-positive) are determined by FACS analysis using a quantitative assay. As shown in FIG. 1, both A2 and B2 very potently deplete CLL cells with EC50 values of about 1000 ng/ml. The average maximum degree of CLL cell depletion at high antibody concentrations is more than 90% for A2 and about 75% for B2. These data demonstrate that antibodies A2 and B2 exert a potent and concentration dependent depletion of CLL cells from whole blood samples of CLL patients in vitro. Example 2 CLL Whole Blood Assay: Comparison to Rituximab and Alemtuzumab In order to compare the effects of A2 and B2 to approved antibodies for CLL treatment the CD20 antibody rituximab and the CD52 antibody alemtuzumab are tested in parallel in the same patient samples. As shown in FIG. 2 CLL cell depletion at an antibody concentration of 10 μg/ml after 3 hours incubation with A2 (9% alive cells) and B2 (26% alive cells) is clearly superior to that observed with alemtuzumab (71% alive cells) and rituximab (80% alive cells). These data demonstrate that the degree of CLL cell depletion of A2 and B2 in whole blood samples from CLL patients is clearly superior to that observed with rituximab and alemtuzumab. Example 3 CLL Whole Blood Assay: Comparison of Different Patient Risk Groups We are particularly interested in the effect of A2 and B2 in cases with genomic aberrations (e.g. TP53 mutation or 17p13 deletion), fludarabine refractory cases and patients after failure of anti-CD20 therapy. These cases are generally considered as “high risk” or “ultra-high risk” patient populations. To this end blood samples from 19 (FIG. 3A) to 21 (FIG. 3B) patients are characterized, including 10 patients of the high risk or ultra-high risk group and 9 (FIG. 3A) to 11 (FIG. 3B) samples without any particular risk features. The high risk or ultra-high risk of patients group comprises patients with 17p13 deletion, TP53 mutation, patients refractory to fludarabine treatment and patient after anti-CD20 treatment. We compare CLL cell depletion in the high risk or ultra-high risk group (17p13 deletion, TP53 mutation, fludarabine refractory, after anti-CD20 treatment; n=10 FIG. 3B) and the remaining patients without any particular risk (n=9 FIG. 3A and n=11 FIG. 3B). For both antibodies A2 and B2 the CLL cell depletion is high in both risk groups, i.e. at 10 μg/ml A2 mean remaining CLL cells: 11.1% (8 h) normal risk; 21.3% high risk; 10 μg/ml B2 mean remaining CLL cells: 33.2% (8 h) normal risk; 43.1% high risk (FIG. 3B). As shown in FIG. 3, especially FIG. 3B, in all investigated patient subgroups the efficacy of A2 and B2 is clearly superior to that of rituximab and alemtuzumab. The findings from this analysis demonstrate that antibodies A2 and B2 show superior CLL depleting activity in all patients subgroups investigated and are especially suited to treat CLL patients with increased risk of treatment failure. Example 4 Antibodies A2 and B2 Show Highly Improved Binding to FC Gamma Receptor 3a The affinity of antibodies A2 and B2 to Fcγ-receptor 3a is determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis (SFP) (Edwards and Leatherbarrow, Determination of Association Rate Constants by an Optical Biosensor Using Initial Rate Analysis. Analytical Biochemistry 246, 1-6, 1997; Nieba et al., Competition BIAcore for Measuring True Affinities: Large Differences from Values Determined from Binding Kinetics. Analytical Biochemistry 234, 155-165, 1996). In brief, recombinant Fcγ-receptor 3a protein, either the high affinity V158 allotype or the low affinity F158 allotype, are coated onto a sensor surface and the dissociation constant KD of antibodies A2 and B2 was calculated using the rates of complex formation (ka) and dissociation (kd) determined by SFP. A non Fc-engineered, IgG1-type of antibody is used as reference antibody. A2 displayed a KD of 8.8 nM to the V158 allotype and a KD of 17.5 nM to the F158 allotype, similar as B2 which displays a KD of 9.3 and 21.1 nM, respectively. In contrast, a non Fc-engineered IgG1 reference antibody displays a KD of 379 nM to the high affinity allotype V158 and 1400 nM to the low affinity allotype F158. In summary, antibodies A2 and B2 display an about 40-fold increased binding to Fcγ-receptor 3a V158 and an about 60-fold to 80-fold increased binding to Fcγ-receptor 3a F158, which is expected to translate into highly increased antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and improved clinical efficacy of A2 and B2. 1.
