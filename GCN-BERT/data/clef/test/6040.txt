The embodiment having a body member (3), being made up of a top portion (4) and a bottom portion (5) (not shown in FIG. 1a). The top portion (4) has a frame (100), enclosing a top work surface (6). The top work surface (6) having a top frame front (101), a top frame back (102), a top frame right side (103), and a top frame left side (104). The bottom member (5) has a bottom frame (207) made up of bottom frame front (207a), bottom frame back (207b), bottom frame right (207c), and bottom frame left (207d) portions. The bottom member (5) is of essentially the same dimensions as the top portion (4) and bottom portion (5) and top portion (4) are hinged to each other with attachment hinge (14) such that when the bottom member (5) is folded up to meet with top portion (4), the two mate appropriately to form a closed tool (1) that resembles an attaché case. In this embodiment, when the top portion (4) and the bottom portion (5) are folded together they form a convenient storage case that is portable and light weight. Attachment hinge (14) is generally attached by any suitable means to each of top portion (4) and to bottom portion (5), such as without limitation, rivets, nails, screws, etc., with rivets (27) being shown in FIG. 1a. In FIG. 1a, primary counter (11) incorporates as a single prefabricated unit therewith, primary counter display (11b), secondary counter (12), and the corresponding function buttons (12a) while the single display in each unit acts as both the primary counter display (11b) and the secondary counter display (12b). The unit is held in place by housing holder (11a). Optional magnetic portions (7b) are placed along the top portion frame back (102) in embodiments where the fastening element (7) (such as, without limitation “S” hook” (7a) or a speed clip) is a metal that can be held in place by a magnet when the tool (1) is in a closed position for storage or transport. For safety considerations, the various corners are optionally rounded and optionally covered with molded plastic corners (22). The top work surface (6) is divided into different regions for different purposes. In one portion, preferably located toward the right side of the work surface (6) is a wet/dry-erase surface (17) for keeping statistics and taking notes. For left handed writers, this may alternatively be located on the left side of the work surface (6). In a second portion of work surface (6). generally located to the left of the wet/dry-erase surface (17) is a texturized/rubberized, non-slip surface (19) typically for placement and use of smart devices (such as, without limitation, tablets, phones, iPods, laptops, etc.). In models designed for left handed writers, the placement of the texturized/rubberized surface (19) and the wet/dry-erase surface (17) are reversed so that the texturized/rubberized surface (19) is located on the right and the wet/dry-erase surface (17) is located to the left thereof. The placement of the other features on the work surface (6) may also be reversed between right and left to further accommodate left-handed users without departing from the present invention. The entire work surface (6) may be fixed, or preferably may be optionally angled by the user for optimal use in viewing information on the work surface (6) and/or for ease of writing information on the work surface (6). Alternatively, each of the textured/rubberized surface (19) and the wet/dry erase surface (17) may be angled independently of one another, via use of suitable support members well known in the art. In an alternate embodiment, not shown, the work surface is removable and can be either rotated 180° and reinserted into appropriate clips or clamps or recesses to change a right-handed configuration to an essentially left handed configuration or vice-versa. In yet another embodiment, the work surface has one surface with the placement in a right handed orientation and an opposite face is a left handed orientation such that by flipping the work surface over the placement of the dry/wet erase board (17) and the texturized/rubberized surface (19) interchange their places and essentially convert a right-handed orientation to a left-handed orientation and back again. Along the top frame back (102) (or optionally along the top portion area located near the top frame back (102)) are at least two fastening elements (7) distally apart from one another for fastening the tool (1) to a fixed vertical support structure (2) (not shown in FIGS. 1 and 1a) such as, without limitation, a fence (such as a chain link fence), trellises, slatted doors, pegboard, etc. The fastening elements (7) can be any suitable fastener, but are preferably fasteners that can easily be removed from the vertical support (2), such as S-hooks, speed clips, suction cups, and/or any other such fasteners known in the art with respect to any appropriate, compatible mounting element used to secure the tool (1) to a vertical structure. Suction cups are suitable with respect to mounting and/or fastening to a smooth, solid surface of a vertical support structure. Along the top portion of the frame back are two oval openings (7c) (see FIGS. 7, 9, 14, and 20) cut into the top frame back (102) or alternatively one on each of the top frame right side (103) and top frame left side (104), preferably in top frame back (102) as connection points allowing for adjustment and easy access for any suitable type of fastener known in the art. Tethers (7d) are preferably built into these openings, but any other known securing mechanism can be used. Due to the accessibility, shape, and simplicity of the oval tether openings (7c), they are one preferred variant. Given a large assortment of fasteners available in the industry, many alternatives for the fasteners for use in the present invention are possible, and this aspect is highly customizable by the user to accommodate any application of securing the tool (1) to vertical structures. Auxiliary fasteners for supplemental use, securing the tool (1) to a horizontal surface, or the inclusion of optional additional legs that support the tool (1) from the ground, for additional versatility are optionally added, and the incorporation thereof is still within the scope of the invention. Preferred embodiments do not require such additional supports, such additional legs, or additional fasteners therefor. In one embodiment, the vertical support member (8) can either be one or more legs (8) that are optionally foldable, collapsible, and/or removable with or without the aid of hinges and/or locking support braces (9). The two leg embodiment shown in FIGS. 1, 2, and 3, in which the legs (8) are distally apart from one another, extend downward from the interior of frame back (102) and/or the top portion underside (4a) is one suitable arrangement. In the single leg embodiment, the leg (8) is placed mid-way between the top left edge (104) and the top right edge (103), but the single leg embodiment is least desirable as it has the least stability in use unless it is the “wide leg” embodiment (such as, without limitation, that having bottom portion (5) acting as the support) described more fully below. Preferably, in single leg (8) embodiments, it is preferably for such single leg (8) to be of significant width or to have portions that fan out to the left and right of the leg (8) to provide additional support against the vertical support structure (2). Legs (8) preferably fold from the open position into the interior region bounded by top portion frame (100) or either by folding forward or folding rightward from the left side or leftward from the right side with appropriate support braces, hinges and hinge connectors (9, 9a) attached to the frame (100) and/or the top portion underside (4) and the particular leg (8) with appropriate support braces, hinges, and hinge connectors (9,9a). Alternatively, or in conjunction with the above, the legs (8a) can lock into the appropriate positions using button locks (not shown). Each of these versions of locking legs in place is well known from their use in collapsible card tables and other devices. In a second embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 1a, 2a, 3, 4, 5, and 6-20, the bottom portion (5) operates as a vertical support member and is dimensioned to be the same front-to-back distance and the same left-to-right distance as the top portion (4), and is hinged by attachment hinge (14) to the top portion (4) so that on folding the top portion (4) and the bottom portion (5) together, the folded tool (1) of the invention resembles an attaché case. When opened and in use, the bottom portion (5) has bottom external surface (205) (which in the open-in-use position abuts the fixed vertical structure), bottom internal surface (206), and a bottom frame (207) therearound, the bottom frame (207) having a bottom frame left side (207d) and bottom frame right side (207c), with braces and/or hinges (9,9a) connecting (a) the bottom frame left side (208d) to the top portion frame left side (104) and bottom frame right side (207c) to the top portion frame right side (103) so as to maintain the tool (1) in a stable open position when in use. Alternatively, these hinges and braces can be used such that they connect (a) the bottom frame left side (207d) to the left side of top portion underside (4) or (b) the left side of the bottom surface (206) to the left side of top portion underside (4) or (c) the left side of the bottom surface (206) to the top portion frame left side (104). Similarly, the corresponding options for the placement of the right side hinge and hinge connector may be used. A single such brace and/or hinge (9) may be used, but is less desirable as it leaves the tool in a less stable condition in use. In a third (most simplified) embodiment of the invention (shown in FIGS. 1b, 1c and 2b), top portion (6) is affixed near the back thereof to vertical support structure (2) by fastening elements (7a). The tool (1) has, in the shown embodiment, attachment cables (39), located on the right and left sides of top surface (6) which are connected to top surface (6) generally near the respective right and left edges thereof generally near the front edge of top (6). However, the connection of attachment cables (39) may be at any convenient location along the right and left sides of top surface (6). Nonetheless, when attachment cables (39) are used, they are preferably attached closer to the front edge of top surface (6) than the tool center of gravity. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1b, the attachment cables (39) are used in place of both the vertical support member (8) and the bottom portion (5). Nonetheless, either or both, of the vertical support member (8) and the bottom portion (5) may be used in combination with the shown attachment cables (39) and/or the attachment hook (38). The embodiment shown in FIG. 1b is shown in a plain vanilla format, with none of the optional features discussed above. However, any of the optional features mentioned with respect to the other embodiments above can be used in conjunction with the embodiment shown in FIG. 1b. FIG. 1c is the same view as FIG. 1b, except that in FIG. 1c dry erase board (17), textured surface (19), and pencil/paper clip (18) are shown in place in one orientation. In yet a further embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 21, the tool (1) is a variant of the “attaché case” type shown in FIG. 1a except that instead of the work surface being top work surface (6), the work surface is contained on the interior of the attaché case. In this embodiment, top portion (4) does not have the features shown as being on the top work surface (6) in the other figures, but does have the fastening elements (7a) along top frame back (102) and optionally additional fastening elements (7a) at or near the front right and left corners near the elements (22). These fastening elements (and optionally additional fastening elements allow top portion (4) to be affixed to vertical support structure (2) with the optional additional fastening elements (7a) that are closest to the front being affixed to a portion of structural support (2) that is vertically higher than that to which the fastening elements (7a) that are on top frame back (102). In FIG. 21, none of these fastening elements (7a) are in view. Once attached to the vertical support structure (2), the tool (1) can be opened by releasing latch (26) and lowering the bottom portion (5) to a horizontal portion. In the horizontal position, the interior surface of bottom portion (5) provides the replacement work surface. In FIG. 21 for simplicity, only the positioning of the texturized surface (19) and wet/dry erase board (17) are shown. However, all or some subset of the features previously identified on top work surface (6) with reference to the embodiment shown in FIG. 1a are present on the bottom portion interior surface (206) which operates as the work surface (6) in the present embodiment. Elements that were shown on bottom portion interior surface (206) (as in FIG. 4 and others) are either eliminated or moved to the top portion underside (4a), which is, in the open position, in a vertical rather than (as shown in the embodiment of FIG. 6) in a horizontal position. In this orientation, the top portion (4) acts as a vertical support against the vertical support structure (2), reinforcing the support obtained from four support elements (7a). In this embodiment, if desired the two support elements (7a) that are located along the top back (102) can be omitted if the “additional support elements (7a)” are present, or all four can be present, if desired. If further support is desired, additional support legs (8) (not shown) which can telescope into the top portion (4), or fold along the bottom portion exterior surface for transport may be added. Alternatively, a panel may be recessed within top portion (4) which panel may be extended from top portion (4) once the tool (1) is attached to the vertical support structure (2) where the panel extends vertically downward to provide additional support against the vertical support structure (2). In these embodiments, the interior surface (206) of bottom portion (5) is optionally, but preferably, constructed so as to be substantially level (or flush) with the bottom portion frame so that the bottom portion frame does not form a significant lip to interfere with the user of the tool (1). The remaining features, are all optional depending upon the particular context of use in which one wishes to use the tool (1). Nonetheless, the most preferred embodiments utilize all or substantially all of the following additional features. These features will be discussed in the context of a baseball/softball/stickball scoring tool, but as will be apparent to those of ordinary skill, minor variations, primarily in the labels of various features or in modifications of the operations of various counters or in software operating such counters, the tool (1) is equally applicable to use as a scoring tool in virtually any sport or competitive activity, whether for individual competitors or for team activities, whether physical competitions or mental competitions, each of which is deemed within the scope of the present invention. In addition, the instant invention is also equally applicable to any environment of use in which a portable work station that can be secured quickly and easily to a vertical support structure is desirable, especially in those contexts where the vertical support is a fence or pegboard or similar structure. These include, without limitation, construction sites, medical facilities, combat zones, and field work of many different types. A first optional feature for the present invention tool (1) is the presence of a solar cell or strip (10) which is located on any available surface which will be exposed to light, preferably exposed to sunlight when the tool (1) is in use. Thus, the solar cell or strip (10) can be located on portions of the top portion (4) that is not occupied by another feature. In embodiments having the bottom external surface (205), the solar cells or strip (10) can be located on surface (205), which either allows for additional solar cells for additional power generation or allows for one to omit the solar cells or strip (10) from the top portion (4), freeing up more of the work surface for other purposes. The solar cells or strip can be of any conventional design known in the art. A rechargeable power supply storage unit which may either simply be conventional replaceable batteries or rechargeable batteries, with the rechargeable batteries being rechargeable from the power generated by the solar cells or strip (10) or via a power cord available to plug into a suitable power source. The rechargeable power supply can be stored in power supply storage unit (13) which can be located at any convenient position either on the underside of the work surface (6) or on the bottom internal surface (206). Preferably, it is located at a position making the connections between it and the solar cell strip (10) as well as between it and the various power usage features convenient. Preferably, a handle (16) is built into the tool (1). It can be located at any convenient edge for carrying purposes. In embodiments having single leg member (8b), the handle can be built into either or both of the top portion (4) and the single leg (8b). The handle can either be a cutout in the work surface (6) and/or the corresponding region of the bottom portion (5), or alternatively can be a handle that is added to any of the frame external surfaces i.e., elements (201), (202), (203), or (204) and/or the corresponding portions of the bottom frame (207) in embodiments having the bottom portion (5). Preferably, the handle is located either (a) at the front portion (near the front edge (101)) of the top portion (4) and/or the front portion (near the bottom portion front edge (207a)) of bottom portion (5) or the back portion (near the back edge (102)) of the top portion (4) and/or the back portion (near the bottom portion frame back (207b) of bottom portion (S). The handles are located generally close to the center of gravity of the tool (1) when in a carrying position for ease of balance, but the exact placement is not critical. Clips for shoulder straps (not shown) for alternate carrying configurations may be added as desired. A latching mechanism is included to maintain the tool in the folded, closed position for transit, especially when it is one of the embodiments that have a bottom portion (5) and the handle does not include grasping both the top portion (4) and the bottom portion (5). While some locations of the handle in these embodiments do not require the latching mechanism, it is preferably present to keep the bottom portion (5) and the top portion in a closed position. However customized for this invention, such latching/locking mechanisms are well known and readily adopted from the luggage and attaché case arts. In a first embodiment, primary counter displays (11,12), are generally present and generally located near the two corners of the top portion (4) that are near the top portion back edge (102). When using for a team sport or two person competitions, one is relegated to the home team or one individual, and the other is relegated to the away team or opponent. The displays can be of any desired type, but are preferably LCD displays. While the displays can be placed on any available free space on the top portion (4), their placement as stated above has been found to be most convenient. If desired, additional such counters can be added. Function buttons (12a) for activation of the counter displays are located near the displays (11b,12b) on the frame side (left or right) nearest the particular display. In a second embodiment, the tally/pitch counters, as used in relation to baseball, softball, stickball and the like, are built into the top portion (4) in a replaceable and serviceable fashion which are secured in a removable housing holder (11a), (such as to change a battery) in the right and left corners near the back edge (102). In the first embodiment, various optional, additional buttons (12a) are present on the top portion (4) for recording information for the appropriate counter displays (11b,12a). For the baseball/softball/stickball configuration, there are four buttons, one for each of inning, balls, strikes, and outs. Additional buttons can be added if desired for recordation of errors, walks, steals etc. If desired, software can be added to reconfigure the various buttons for other sports. The buttons (12a) can be hard labeled if desired, or have displays associated with each that can be changed as desired depending on the sport or activity for which the tool (1) is being adapted for use. The various buttons can, if desired, be integrated together with the respective secondary displays. In another embodiment, where the use of a tablet or other smart device may be used in game scoring, the incorporation of the additional four buttons may or may not be desirable and therefore may or may not be present. A pencil/pen/marker holder clip and/or paper clip (18) may be present on the work surface (6) and is generally located near the margin of the wet/dry erase surface that is closest to the back edge (102). A pencil sharpener may also be present and is generally recessed within front edge (101). While it may be located at any available position along front edge (101), for convenience, in right hand models it is located near the frame right side (103), and in left hand models it is located near frame left side (104). The pencil sharpener may be a manual one or a powered one, powered by the various power sources discussed above. As shown in a second embodiment, the orientation of the pencil sharpener (20) is located in the top portion (4) recessed into the top right frame side (103) and secured with a (preferably plastic) housing (24). Storage compartments of various sizes and shapes for useful items can be incorporated on the underside of the work surface (6), or attached to any available space on the bottom portion (5) internal surface (206) (when the bottom portion (5) is present). As shown in the second embodiment, there are areas dedicated to storing specific accessories such as, but not limited to, rechargeable battery, charging cable, tablet, smart device, writing implements or scorebooks etc. As shown in the second embodiment, there is present internal storage space (100a) with an elastic band/keeper (28) to secure stored accessories. A foldable/collapsible convenience cup holder (21) can be integrated into the tool (1) by having a slot (21a) in any available position of the frame right side (103) or the frame left side (104). The slot (21a) can accommodate a clip for a cup holder or contain a movable cup holder that moves out of the slot.
