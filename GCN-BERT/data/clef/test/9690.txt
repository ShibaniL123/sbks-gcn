Step 5. Preparation of 4-Amino-5-cyano-6-(4-oxo-2-phenyl-4H-chromen-3-yl) methylaminopyrimidine
3-Aminomethyl-2-phenyl-4H-chromen-4-one hydrochloride (80mg, 0.28mmol), 4-amino-5-cyano-6-chloropyrimidine (47mg, 0.30mmol) and potassium carbonate (116mg, 0.84mmol) were dissolved in 3ml of DMF and reacted at room temperature overnight. TLC tracking was performed until the completion of the reaction. Water was added to the reaction solution, and the reaction solution was extracted with ethyl acetate, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated and made into a mixture for chromatography, and purified by HPLC to give 12mg of a white solid, yield: 11.6%.
