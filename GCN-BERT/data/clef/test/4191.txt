Step 2
3-Methyl-5-(1,4-dioxaspiro[4.5]dec-7-en-8-yl)isoxazole
3-Methyl-5-(tributylstannyl)isoxazole (4.00 g, 10.7 mmol) was dissolved in 1,4-dioxane (30 mL). 1,4-Dioxaspiro[4.5]dec-7-en-8-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate (2.57 g, 8.93 mmol) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(1.02 g, 0.883 mmol) were added to the reaction solution at 25°C. The reaction was heated to 120°C and stirred for 2 hours. The reaction was cooled to 25°C, diluted with ethyl acetate (70 mL), washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (30 mL x 2), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (5:1 petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.3) to give 3-methyl-5-(1,4-dioxaspiro[4.5]dec-7-en-8-yl) isoxazole (1.21 g, as a yellow oil) with a yield of 62%. MS-ESI calcd. [M + H]+ 222, found 222.
