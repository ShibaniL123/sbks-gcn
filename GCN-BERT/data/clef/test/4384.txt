Preparation of N-[1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl]-6-[(6S,8R)-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-3,6,8,9-tetrahydropyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl]pyridin-3-amine
Trifluoro acetic acid (1.30 L, 17.04 mol) was added to a stirred solution of tert-butyl (1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)carbamate (0.50 Kg, 2.04 mol) in DCM (1.50 L) at 0° C. over 0.5 hours. The mixture was allowed to warm to 20° C. and stirred at 20° C. for 2.5 hours. The mixture was heated to 30° C. and stirring was continued for 1 hour. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue was concentrated under reduced pressure from toluene (3×3.00 L). The resulting residue was dissolved in 1,4-dioxane (3.00 L) and treated with 30% sodium 2-methylbutan-2-olate solution in Me-THF (5.50 L, 13.63 mol) over 45 minutes, ensuring the temperature did not exceed 29° C. A solution of 90% w/w (6S,8R)-6-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (0.81 Kg, 1.70 mol) in 1,4-dioxane (1.50 L) and BrettPhos Pd G3 (0.077 Kg, 0.085 mol) were added and the atmosphere was replaced with nitrogen using cycles of vacuum and nitrogen (3×). The mixture was heated to 55° C. and stirred at 55° C. 2.5 hours. The mixture was cooled to 21° C. and an 8% NaHCO3 solution in water (7.16 L, 6.82 mol) was added, followed by isopropyl acetate (4.50 L). The mixture was stirred for 2-3 minutes and the layers were separated. The organic layer was washed with 8% NaHCO3 solution in water (7.16 L, 6.82 mol), stirring the mixture for 5 minutes and then the layers were separated. The combined aqueous layers were extracted with isopropyl acetate (4.50 L). The combined organic layers were treated with Silicycle (SiliaMetS-Thiol, 400 g, 1.26 mmol/g, 6 eq vs. Pd) and the mixture was stirred for 16 hours. The solids were removed by filtration through celite, washing the filter-cake with isopropyl acetate. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure (bath temperature 40° C.). The residue was dissolved in isopropyl acetate (5.00 L) and treated with further Silicycle (SiliaMetS-Thiol, 250 g, 1.26 mmol/g, 3.7 eq vs. Pd). The resulting mixture was stirred at 21° C. for 16 hours. The solids were removed by filtration through celite, washing the filter-cake with isopropyl acetate (2.50 L). The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure (bath temperature 40° C.) to give a brown foam. The crude product was purified by preparative SFC (Lux C4 column, 50 mm diameter, 250 mm length), using a gradient elution of a EtOH/DEA 100/0.5 in CO2, 140 bar mobile phase at a flow rate of 400 mL/minute at 40° C.) to give a light brown solid foam. EtOAc (2.00 L) was added and the solution was concentrated under reduced pressure. EtOAc (1.90 L) and heptane (1.90 L) were added and the mixture was seeded at 25° C. The mixture was kept at 25° C. for 1 hour. Heptane (6.50 L) was added over 2 hours to the stirring mixture. The resulting mixture was stirred at 22° C. for 18 hours. The resulting solid was collected by filtration, washing the filter-cake with 1:5 EtOAc/heptane (2.50 L). The solid was sucked dry under a nitrogen blanket for 30 minutes, then dried under vacuum at 40° C. for 9 days to give N-(1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)-6-((6S,8R)-8-methyl-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)pyridin-3-amine (626 g, 77%) as an off-white solid.
