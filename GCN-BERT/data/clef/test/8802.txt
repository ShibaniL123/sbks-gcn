FORMULATIONS OF MAZINDOL CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims priority to US provisional application no. 61/282,788 filed on March 31,2010. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002] Mazindol, (RS)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-3,5-dihydro-2/-/-imidazo[2,1 a]isoindol-5-ol, is a sympathomimetic amine, which is similar to amphetamines. It is also known as an "anorectic" or an "anorexigenic" drug. Mazindol stimulates the central nervous system which increases heart rate and blood pressure and decreases appetite. [0003] Mazindol exhibits instability at alkaline pH condition, especially in the presence of water. Thus, development of a stable immediate or modified release formulation of mazindol presents a challenge that is solved by the instant invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0004] In one embodiment, the current invention is directed towards stable immediate release (IR) and modified release formulations of mazindol that comprise not more than 5% by weight of the formulation of water. Further, the modified release formulations optionally comprising stabilizing agents are also disclosed. In another embodiment of the invention, the modified release formulation is an extended release formulation. In another embodiment, the modified release formulation is a delayed release (DR) formulation. In yet further embodiment, the modified release formulation is a formulation that provides a pulsatile release. The pulsatile release may be achieved using a combination of an extended release with a delayed release, or immediate release with an extended release, or immediate release with a delayed release, or immediate release with an extended release and delayed release. [0005] In a different embodiment of the invention, stable immediate release formulations of mazindol that comprise not more than 5% of water by weight of the formulation are provided. In yet further embodiment, the invention discloses stabilized immediate release formulations of mazindol comprising stabilizing agents. [0006] The further embodiment covers a dosage form containing the formulation of the current invention wherein said dosage form is selected from tablets, capsules, beads, granules, powders, caplets, troches, sachets, cachets, pouches, gums, sprinkles, solutions and suspensions. The tablets may be osmotic tablets, matrix tablets, bi- and multilayer tablets, fast disintegrating tablets, mini-tablets, and other type of tablets commonly used in the art. The capsules may contain pellets, beads, tablets, mini-tablets, granules, and/or powders. Capsules may also be soft gelatin capsules containing non-aqueous or partially non-aqueous fill. The formulation may be also presented in the form of pellets in a capsule, where the capsule can be opened and the pellets sprinkled on to soft food or in a liquid and then swallowed. [0007] Although many of the embodiments and discussion herein are with respect to mazindol per se, the invention should not be so limited. The present invention also contemplates the hydrolysis product of mazindol (HP, chemical name: 2-(2-Aminoethyl)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-hydro-2,3-dihydroxy-1 H-isoindol-1 -one), and/or prodrugs of mazindol and/or prodrugs of the hydrolysis product of mazindol for administration to mammals to treat CNS disorders. [0008] Further, the present invention provides a once-a-day dosage form of mazindol and/or hydrolysis product thereof and/or prodrug thereof and/or salt thereof delivering to a mammal a therapeutically effective amount of the active ingredient for the treatment of CNS disorders, including but not limited to the treatment of ADHD. [0009] Additionally, stabilized formulations of mazindol prepared from mazindol starting material having low level of impurities are also disclosed. [0010] In an additional embodiment, the invention also provides a dosage form of mazindol that can provide therapeutic levels of the drug for the period of time from 6 to 24 hours.

DEFINITIONS [0032] Unless otherwise specified, “a” or “an” means “one or more” in the present application. [0033] The term “mazindol” means (RS)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-3,5-dihydro-2H-imidazo[2,1-a]isoindol-5-ol or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof, as well as variable mixtures of the R and S enantiomers or either one of the R or S enantiomers in a substantially pure form. [0034] An "immediate release formulation" refers to a formulation that releases greater than or equal to about 80% by weight of the active pharmaceutical agent in less than or equal to about 1 hour. [0035] The term “modified release” encompasses any mode of release that is different from the immediate release. [0036] In the current application, the term “non-pFI dependent polymers” is used to mean “polymers having solubility that is not pFI-dependent” and the term “pH dependent polymers” is used to mean “polymers having solubility that is pH-dependent”; [0037] For the purposes of this application, terms “pH-dependent polymers” and “enteric polymers” are used interchangeably. [0038] The term “particles”, as used herein, includes, without any limitations on the nature and size thereof, any particles, spheres, beads, granules, pellets, particulates or any structural units that may be incorporated into an oral dosage form. [0039] The term “impurity” refers throughout this application to any entity different from the active ingredient(s), water or excipients . For example, HP may be considered an impurity where mazindol is the intended active ingredient. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0040] Though mazindol drug substance is chemically stable, its stability in the immediate or modified release formulations is often compromised because it appears that mazindol is not compatible with many commonly used pharmaceutical excipients. A combination of mazindol with these excipients results in significant degradation of the active agent. [0041] It was unexpectedly discovered that the problem of instability may be solved by keeping the total amount of water in the formulation to a very low level, less than 5%, preferably less than 2%, by weight of the formulation. [0042] It was also discovered, surprisingly, that stability of a mazindol formulation can be improved by using the mazindol drug starting material with substantially reduced level of impurities. Thus the current invention provides for mazindol, the starting material, having a total amount of impurities (e.g., HP) less than 1.0% of the active ingredient, preferably less than 0.5%, more preferably less than 0.25%, and most preferably, less than 0.1%. Accordingly, the current invention provides for formulations of mazindol wherein the total amount of impurities (e.g., HP) is less than 5% of the active ingredient, preferably less than 2.5%. [0043] It was further discovered that stable formulations of mazindol may be prepared with the use of certain excipients (referred to herein as “stabilizing excipients”). In one embodiment of the invention, excipients are acidifiers selected from the group consisting of fumaric acid, citric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, ascorbic acid, edetic acid, aspartic acid, adipic acid, alginic acid, benzoic acid, butandioic acid, erythorbic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, maleic acid , glutamic acid, sorbic acid, succinic acid, acacia, aluminum phosphate, aluminum sulfate, ammonium alum, ammonium chloride, carbomers, edetate calcium disodium, edetate disodium, methacrylic acid copolymers, polycarbophils, polydextrose, potassium alum, potassium phosphate monobasic, sodium metabisulfite, sodium phosphate monobasic, sodium starch glycolate, zinc acetate and zinc sulfate, pharmaceutical grade ion exchange resins such as Amberlite IRP64, Amberlite IRP68, Amberlite IRP69, Amberlite IR120, Dowex 50, and combinations thereof. [0044] In another embodiment of the invention, stabilizing excipients are selected from hydrophobicity inducing (hydrophobizing) agents. These agents may be represented by magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl behenate, glyceryl stearate, glyceryl palmitostearate, waxes and hydrogenated vegetable oils, among others known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Combinations of these excipients may also be used. [0045] Stabilizers may be incorporated into the formulations of mazindol in a variety of ways. They may be intermixed with the active ingredient and/or other excipients, or may be provided in the form of a coating on the mazindol-containing substrate. Alternatively, excipients, such as bulking agents, may be pre-treated by the stabilizers prior to their incorporation into the formulation. Stabilization of mazindol may be also achieved by coating drug loaded core substrates such as pellets and tablets with coating polymers dissolved or dispersed in acidic solution. [0046] These and further ways of using stabilizers are disclosed in more details in the examples below. [0047] Additional excipients that can be used to formulate stable mazindol drug products in accordance with the current invention include bulking agents, such as lactose anhydrous, lactose monohydrate, Supertab 21ΑΝ, Ludipress, Ludipress LCE, Fast Flo Lactose, Supertose, Pharmatose, Respitose, glyceryl behenate, and hypromellose; wetting and solubility enhancing agents, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, polyethylene glycol, PEG glyceryl esters, lecithin, poloxamer, the polysorbates, the polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyethylene castor oil derivatives, polysorbates, polyethylene stearate, and the sorbitan esters; fillers such as low moisture microcrystalline cellulose (Avicel® grades PH-103, PH-112, PH-113, PH-200), colloidal silicon dioxide, dextrates (anhydrous), dextrose (anhydrous), maltol, fructose, glyceryl palmitostearate, glyceryl monostearate, guar gum, lactitol anhydrous), lactose (anhydrous), lecithin, magnesium carbonate, maltitol, maltose, mannitol, poloxamer, polyethylene oxide, sorbitol, sucrose, compressible sugar, confectioner’s sugar, xylitol. These excipients may be used separately or in combinations. [0048] Through use of stabilizers and excipients with low levels of moisture as described above, the inventors were able to realize one goal of the current invention: to provide stable immediate release formulations of mazindol that comprise not more than 5% of water by weight of the formulation. In yet further embodiment, the invention discloses stable immediate release formulations of mazindol comprising stabilizing excipients. [0049] A further goal of the current invention is to utilize stabilization techniques described above to provide stable modified release formulations of mazindol comprising mazindol, at least one release controlling polymer that may be a non-pH-dependent polymer or a pH-dependent, enteric polymer, or a combination thereof, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Further, the invention provides modified release formulations of mazindol comprising mazindol, at least one release controlling polymer and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients selected from those described above, wherein the total amount of residual water in the formulation is not more than 5% by weight of the formulation. [0050] Further, the invention provides modified release formulations of mazindol where the total amount of impurities in mazindol drug substance does not exceed 2.5%; preferably does not exceed 2%; and even more preferably does not exceed 1 %. A synergistic enhancement of stability is achieved by employing high-purity mazindol and low - moisture excipients, or low-moisture excipients and acidic excipients, or high-purity mazindol and low-moisture excipients and acidic excipients, as discussed above. [0051] The modified release formulations of mazindol exhibiting extended release profile, or delayed release profile, or combination of extended release and delayed release profile, or any combination of those with an immediate release profile are disclosed herein. In some embodiments, the formulations may exhibit a pulsatile release profile. These specific release profiles are achieved by formulating mazindol, at least one release controlling polymer and at least one excipient in a variety of inventive formulations. [0052] The release controlling polymers of the current invention may be selected from non-pFI-dependent polymers such as hydrophilic rate controlling compounds that can be used to formulate modified release multiparticulates or matrix tablets drug products, and hydrophobic rate controlling compounds that exhibit limited or no water solubility; or enteric polymers that exhibit ρΗdependent solubility. The following non-limiting examples of such compounds are provided below: [0053] Hydrophilic compounds: hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose (hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose), methyl cellulose, polyethylene oxide, acacia, acrylic acid derivatives (e.g., carbomer homopolymer type A NF and carbomer homopolymer type Β NF), hydroxyethyl cellulose, carrageenan, tragacanth, xanthan gum, povidone, alginic acid (and salts thereof), polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethylcellulose, and combinations thereof. [0054] Hydrophobic compounds: ethylcellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, waxes (e.g., carnauba wax, microcrystalline wax), hydrogenated vegetable oils, Compritol 888 ΑΤΟ (glyceryl behenate), Precirol ΑΤΟ 5 (glyceryl palmitostearate), PEG glyceryl esters such as Gelucire 50/1, Eudragit® NE30D or Eudragit NM30D poly(ethyl acrylate-co-methyl methacrylate) ethyl acrylate methyl methacrylate copolymer, Eudragit® RS and Eudragit® RL poly (ethyl acrylate-co-methyl methacrylatecotrimethylammonioethyl methacrylate chloride), polyvinyl acetate, cellulose acetate propionate, and combinations thereof. [0055] pH-dependent compounds: Eudragit® FS30D (poly (methyl acrylate-co-methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid)), Eudragit® L30D-55, Eudragit® L and Eudragit® S (poly (methacrylic acid-co-methyl methacrylate)), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate, shellac, zein, and combinations thereof. [0056] The release controlling polymer (non- pH-dependent polymer, ρΗdependent polymer or combination of both) may be included into the formulation in the amount of from 5% to 99%, preferably in the amount of from 5% to 75%, most preferably in the amount of from 5% to 50%, by weight of the formulation. [0057] Non-pH-dependent polymers that can be used for coating multiparticulates or tablets (matrix or immediate release) include: cellulose esters, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, ethylcellulose, Eudragit® RS and Eudragit® RL poly (ethyl acrylate-co-methyl methacrylatecotrimethylammonioethyl methacrylate chloride), Eudragit® NE30D or Eudragit NM30D poly(ethyl acrylate-co-methyl methacrylate), ethyl acrylate methyl methacrylate copolymer, polyvinyl acetate and combinations thereof. [0058] In addition, the following enteric compounds can be used in a coating to provide a delay in the release profile: Eudragit® FS30D (poly (methyl acrylate-co-methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid)), Eudragit® L30D-55, Eudragit® L and Eudragit® S (poly (methacrylic acid-co-methyl methacrylate)), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate, shellac, zein, and combinations thereof. [0059] These polymers may be used to prepare a variety of modified release systems: [0060] A) Matrix systems, wherein an active pharmaceutical ingredient (mazindol, or mazindol and an additional active); at least one release controlling polymer and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient are homogeneously intermixed to form a matrix. Hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymers listed above may be used to prepare these mazindol-containing matrices. These matrices may be presented in the form of matrix tablets, matrix multiparticulates, or in a form of a layer coated onto a substrate. [0061] Matrix tablet formulations are capable of providing a single drug release profile or multiple drug release profiles. Matrix tablet technologies that are capable of providing multiple release profiles include multiple layer tablets (e.g., bilayer or tri-layer tablets), tablet within a tablet technology, encapsulated mini-tablets or a tablet of compressed modified release pellets. [0062] Β) Drug-layered systems that comprise an inert core and at least one drug-containing layer coated onto this core. The drug containing layer(s) may be further coated with a layer of a release controlling polymer selected from those listed above. If the drug-containing layer of the drug-layered system does not contain any release-controlling polymers and is of an immediate release, then the release controlling coating is necessary for achieving the modified profiles of the current invention. In the cases when drug-containing layer is an extended-release matrix layer described above, the release controlling coating is optional and allows for additional modification of the release profile. [0063] For example, it may be used to modulate the release (slow initially, faster later; or fast initially, slower later), or to provide a delay in the release. In particular, non-pH-dependent polymers that can be used for coating multiparticulates or tablets (matrix or immediate release) include: cellulose esters, cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, ethylcellulose, Eudragit® RS and Eudragit® RL poly (ethyl acrylate-co-methyl methacrylatecotrimethylammonioethyl methacrylate chloride), Eudragit® NE30D or Eudragit NM30D poly(ethyl acrylate-co-methyl methacrylate), ethyl acrylate methyl methacrylate copolymer, polyvinyl acetate, [0064] In addition, the following enteric compounds can be used in a coating to provide a delay in the release profile: Eudragit® FS30D (poly (methyl acrylate-co-methyl methacrylate-co-methacrylic acid)), Eudragit® L30D-55 Eudragit® L and Eudragit® S (poly (methacrylic acid-co-methyl methacrylate)), hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate, cellulose acetate phthalate, shellac zein, and combinations thereof. [0065] Without putting any limitations thereon, the formulations of this embodiment may be exemplified by the following variations that provide different modified pharmacokinetic (ΡΚ) profiles for mazindol: - Mixed particles in a capsule, compressed tablet or any other dosage form where IR particles are mixed with DR particles (IR/DR mixed particles). The IR particles provide the initial release of the therapeutic agent followed by release from the DR particles resulting in pulsed ΡΚ profiles. (IR/DR mixed population of particles) - A single population of particles in a capsule, compressed tablet or any other dosage form where the pellet incorporates an IR core coated with DR coat which is further coated with an IR drug layer. The outer IR drug layer provides an immediate release of the therapeutic agent followed by a delayed release from the DR core resulting in pulsed ΡΚ profile. (IR/DR single population of particles) - Mixed particles in a capsule, compressed tablet or any other dosage form where IR particles are mixed with DR coated XR particles (IR/DR-XR). The IR particles provide the initial release of the therapeutic agent followed by delayed and extended release from the DR coated XR particles. (IR/DR-XR mixed population of particles) - A single population of particles in a capsule, compressed tablet or any other dosage form where the pellet incorporates an IR core coated with XR coat, which is coated with DR coat that is subsequently drug layered. The outer drug layer provides the initial release of the therapeutic agent followed by delayed and extended release from the remainder of the pellet. (IR/DR-XR single population of particles) - Mixed particles in a capsule, compressed tablet or any other dosage form where a fast XR pellet is mixed with a DR pellet. The fast XR provides the initial release of the therapeutic agent followed by release from the DR particles. (XR-f/DR mixed population of particles) - A single population of particles in a capsule, compressed tablet or any other dosage form where the pellet incorporates IR core coated with a DR coat which is then coated with drug layer that is subsequently coated with an XR coat to produce a fast XR layer. The fast XR outer layer provides the initial release of the therapeutic agent followed by delayed release from the DR core. (XR-f/DR single population of particles) - A DR tablet coated with an IR drug layer - One or more than one DR tablets are mixed with one or more than one IR tablets in a capsule - XR tablet coated with a DR coat, then coated with an IR drug layer - A bi-layer tablet with one layer containing the drug in XR form and a 2nd layer containing the drug in an IR form - A bi-layer tablet with one layer containing the drug in XR form and a 2nd layer containing the drug in an DR form - A DR coated matrix tablet providing an DR/XR profile. [0066] To optimize stability of mazindol in a matrix system, the preferred methods for formulation and processing would be dry methods such as direct compression of a dry powder blend, compression of a roller compacted granulation, compression of a holt melt granulation or a hot melt extrudate. The compressible intermediates (i.e., the dry powder blend, roller compacted granulation, hot melt granulation etc.) can be formulated to be rate controlling in nature (i.e., comprise a drug release rate controlling excipient(s)) or be mixed with release rate controlling excipient(s) prior to tablet compression. Additionally, wet granulations can be manufactured, dried and sized for compression into matrix tablets. [0067] Stabilization techniques, such as using acidic pH media, for the drug substance would be required unless non-aqueous media are employed in the wet granulation process. Additionally, in accordance with the nature of this invention, low moisture content excipients and excipients that by their chemical nature create an acidic environment in the matrix are preferably used. The acidic environment promoted by these excipients can also act to promote the solubility of the drug substance which can be desired in a modified release matrix system formulated to deliver drug in the less acidic regions of the gastrointestinal tract. Stabilization is also achieved by coating drug layered substrates with coating polymers dissolved or dispersed in acidic solution. [0068] Processes useful for producing drug-layered systems include solution or dry powder drug layering onto inert substrates (e.g. sugar or microcrystalline cellulose spheres), spray drying and lyophilization. As mentioned above, due to the chemical instability of mazindol the preferred methods for drug layered systems would be the dry methods (i.e., dry powder drug layering and methods that can process with non-aqueous media, such as spray drying. If the method is to include an aqueous solution in the process (e.g., drug layering), stabilization techniques such as using acidic pH aqueous media may be employed. [0069] Additionally, it is preferred to use low moisture content excipients and excipients that by their chemical nature create an acidic environment. The present inventors have found that excipients with a combination of these properties might provide a synergistic stabilization effect. The acidic environment promoted by these excipients can also act to promote the solubility of the drug substance which can be desired in a modified release drug-layered system formulated to deliver drug in the less acidic regions of the gastrointestinal tract. [0070] C) The osmotic release systems. In a further embodiment, this invention provides an extended release mazindol preparation in the form of an osmotic tablet, wherein the drug release rate is determined by the rate of water permeation into the tablet core through a semi-permeable membrane coating. [0071] For stability of mazindol in an osmotic tablet formulation, the preferred methods for core tablet formulation and processing would be dry methods such as direct compression of a dry powder blend, compression of a roller compacted granulation, compression of a holt melt granulation or a hot melt extrudate. Additionally, fluid bed granulation processes or a high or low shear granulation method can be used when stabilization techniques for the drug substance are employed, such as using acidic pH granulation media or non-aqueous granulation media. It is preferred to use low moisture content excipients and excipients that by their chemical nature create an acidic environment in the core tablet of the osmotic dosage form. The acidic environment promoted by these excipients can also act to promote the solubility of the drug substance which can be a desired attribute when the osmotic tablet formulation is to deliver drug in the less acidic regions of the gastrointestinal tract. [0072] For the preparation of the osmotic tablet, mazindol is mixed with osmotic agent(s), tabletting aides such as diluents and lubricants, and other commonly used excipients. The mixture is tabletted either by direct compression or granulation followed by compression. Tablets are then coated with a semi-permeable rate-controlling membrane. [0073] The semipermeable rate-controlling membrane, which surrounds the drug-containing core, comprises a water insoluble, pharmaceutically acceptable polymer. Suitable water insoluble polymers include, for example, cellulose esters, cellulose ethers and cellulose ester ethers. Non-limiting examples of such polymers include cellulose acylate, cellulose ethyl ether, cellulose diacylate, cellulose triacylate, cellulose acetate, cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, mono-, di- and tricellulose alkyls, mono-, di- and tricellulose aroyls, and combinations thereof. [0074] The semi-permeable rate controlling membrane is applied on the tablets using standard coating techniques such as spraying, dipping, casting, coating solvent evaporation, molding or compression coating. An orifice is drilled on the tablet coat using laser tablet drilling system or other mechanical means to allow the release of drug from the core. The osmotic agents used for the practice of the current invention are well known in the art and include non-swellable compounds represented by, but not limited to, polyols; carbohydrates including monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides and sugar alcohols; salts; acids and hydrophilic polymers. [0075] For example, osmotic agents may be selected from mannitol, maltrin, xylitol, maltitol, lactitol, isomalt, sorbitol, arabitol, erythritol, ribitol, insositol, lactose, glucose, sucrose, raffinose, fructose, dextran, glycine, urea, citric acid, tartaric acid, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, sodium sulfate, lithium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium succinate, polyethylene glycol, maltodextrin, cyclodextrins and derivatives, non-swelling block polymers of ΡΕΟ and ΡΡΟ, polyols, polyethylene glycols, cellulose ethers, and combinations thereof. Osmotic agents that are acidic by nature may have multiple functions in the formulations of the present invention acting simultaneously as stabilizers. Alternatively, they may provide synergistic action with additional stabilizers. [0076] Osmotic tablets can be formulated as a single or as a multiple layer core. In one embodiment, the osmotic tablet comprises a bilayer core, wherein one layer comprises agents to modulate drug release, such as a solubilizer, that are released in an extended manner, and the second layer comprises the drug and potentially other agents to modulate drug release. [0077] An overcoat of drug can be applied to the tablet following functional coating to provide an immediate release component to the dosage form. Alternatively, the osmotic tablet may be coated with an enteric polymer on top of the semipermeable membrane providing a DR/XR profile. [0078] The embodiments listed above are just non-limiting examples of the modified release stable formulations of mazindol resulting in a product that maintains therapeutic level of the drug in the body from 6 to 24 hrs. [0079] The amount of the drug in a dosage form of the formulations of the instant invention depends on the indication and exact nature of the drug. For mazindol, a daily dose comprises from 0.1 mg to 20mg of the drug, preferably from 0.5mg to 10mg. Prodrugs of mazindol that are also within the scope of the instant invention may be delivered in daily doses of from 0.1 mg to 200mg of the active ingredient. For the hydrolysis product of mazindol (HP), the daily dose can vary from 0.1 mg to 200mg. For the prodrug of HP, the daily dose can vary from 0.1 mg to 400mg. [0080] Mazindol used in the practice of the current invention may be in the form of a single R enantiomer, or in the form of a single S enantiomer, or in the form of a racemic mixture, or in the form of a non-racemic mixture of enantiomers with various amounts of R and S enantiomers. In one embodiment, the amount of an R enantiomer in the mixture is from 0% to 90% by weight of the active pharmaceutical agent. In another embodiment, the amount of R enantiomer is from 0% to 75% by weight of the active pharmaceutical agent. In a further embodiment, it is from 0% to 50%. In a yet further embodiment, it is from 0% to 25%, by weight of the active pharmaceutical agent. [0081] Techniques for enantiomer separation are known to those skilled in the art and include chromatographic techniques using enantio-selective stationary phase, capillary electrophoresis, and liquid-liquid extraction techniques. A particular enantiomer can also be produced directly from the synthetic reaction for the manufacture of mazindol. [0082] In one embodiment of the invention, an R enantiomer of mazindol is used for the treatment of CNS disorders including but not limited to ADFID. [0083] In another embodiment of the invention, an S enantiomer of mazindol is used for the treatment of CNS disorders including but not limited to ADHD. [0084] In the further embodiment of the invention, the use of a mixture of R and S enantiomers in various ratios in the treatment of CNS disorders, including but not limited to ADHD. [0085] The hydrolysis product, 2-(2-Aminoethyl)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydroxy-1 H-isoindol-1-one, may be included into the inventive formulations of mazindol in the amount of from 0% to 100% by weight of the total load of the active pharmaceutical agent. In one embodiment, it is included in the amount of from 0% to 50% by weight of the active pharmaceutical agent. In another embodiment, it is included in the amount of from 0% to 25% by weight of the active pharmaceutical agent. [0086] It was unexpectedly discovered that formulations comprising the hydrolysis product of mazindol may be stabilized and delivered in the same manner and used for the same indications as the inventive formulations comprising non- hydrolyzed mazindol. Thus, current invention also provides for formulations comprising from 0.1 mg to 200mg of the hydrolysis product of mazindol (HP) as an active substance. All inventive embodiments disclosed herein for mazindol are fully applicable for the formulations comprising HP or combinations of mazindol with HP. Further, formulations comprising prodrugs that convert into HP in the mammalian body are also within the scope of the instant invention. Such formulations may comprise from 0.1 mg to 400 mg of the prodrug. [0087] The hydrolysis product of mazindol may be used in the form of a pure R enantiomer, or in the form of a pure S enantiomer, or in the form of a mixture of R and S enantiomers in various ratios. [0088] In one additional embodiment, formulations of mazindol as disclosed above may comprise molindone as an additional pharmaceutical ingredient. This embodiment is especially beneficial for the treatment of a subpopulation of patients exhibiting impulsive aggression, aggression, or conduct disorder in the setting of ADHD. [0089] The invention is further illustrated by, though in no way limited to, the following examples.
