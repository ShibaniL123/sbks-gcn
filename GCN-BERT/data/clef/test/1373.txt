Step 5: Preparation of (S)-5-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-methyl-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one
50 mg (0.16 mmol) of 5-chloro-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-methyl-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one prepared in step 4 was dissolved in 2 mL of anhydrous dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), to which 57 mg (0.19 mmol, 1.2 equivalent) of (S)-2-(1-aminoethyl)-5-chloro-3-phenylquinazoline-4(3H)-one and 0.06 mL (0.35 mmol, 2.2 equivalent) of diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) were added, followed by stirring at 70Â° C. for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled down to room temperature. Water was added thereto, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The extracted organic layer was separated, dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: hexane/ethylacetate, 2/1) to give 88 mg of the target compound (S)-5-((1-(5-chloro-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,4-dihydroquinazoline-2-yl)ethyl)amino)-1-(4-methoxybenzyl)-3-methyl-2,3-dihydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-4(1H)-one as a white solid (0.15 mmol, yield: 94%).
