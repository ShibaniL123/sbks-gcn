EXAMPLE 1
4-{(S)-2-[(S)-2-(tert-Butoxycarbonylamino)-3-phenylpropanamido]-2-(4-ethylthiazol-2-yl)ethyl}phenylsulfamic acid (5)
Preparation of [1-(S)-carbamoyl-2-(4-nitrophenyl)ethyl-carbamic acid tert-butyl ester (1): To a 0 °C solution of 2-(S)-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-propionic acid and N-methylmorpholine (1.1 mL, 9.65 mmol) in DMF (10 mL) is added dropwise iso-butyl chloroformate (1.25 mL, 9.65 mmol). The mixture is stirred at 0 °C for 20 minutes after which NH3 (g) is passed through the reaction mixture for 30 minutes at 0 °C. The reaction mixture is concentrated and the residue dissolved in EtOAc, washed successively with 5% citric acid, water, 5% NaHCO3, water and brine, dried (Na2SO4), filtered and concentrated in vacuo to a residue that is triturated with a mixture of EtOAc/petroleum ether to provide 2.2 g (74%) of the desired product as a white solid.
