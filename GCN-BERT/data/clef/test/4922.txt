CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This Non-Provisional Utility application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/610,784, filed on Mar. 14, 2012, which is incorporated herein in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure relates generally to sporting goods. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a basketball hoop including a hoop mounted to a frame having a cavity for holding a plurality of pieces assembled together as a puzzle forming a planar backboard where the plurality of backboard pieces are projected outwards from the cavity to emulate a backboard shattering during a slam dunk. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Basketball has become a very popular sport played by amateurs and professionals alike. The sport is often broadcasted on local and national television and is played by professional national basketball association teams, collegiate teams, and regional schools. Amateurs often play basketball in residential driveways, at local recreational centers, at parks, and the like. The game of basketball is typically played on a playing surface identified as a basketball court and two basketball hoops are positioned at opposite ends of the basketball court and situated a predetermined height from the court. The playing surface may include identifiers, such as circles, arcs, and a variety of straight and curved lines, to define the playing boundaries prescribed by game rules. Teams compete against each other in an effort to score the most points by throwing a basketball through the opponent's basketball hoop. Conventional basketball hoops include a round metal rim or hoop attached to a backboard. A netting material is suspended downward from the hoop, and the hoop is securely positioned about the lower, horizontally centered region of the backboard. The backboard is often constructed from glass, Plexiglas, or a hard thick plastic material. The diameter of the basketball hoop is larger than a basketball to allow the ball to pass easily through the hoop during play. There are a variety of different basketball hoops on the market today. Some configurations include brackets designed to permanently attach the basketball hoop to a substantially vertical surface, such as a garage, while others include columns, adjustable frames or telescoping beams that provide mobility in moving and placing the basketball hoops in different locations if desired. One crowd-pleasing play that is often seen during the game of basketball is what is coined “a slam dunk”. A slam-dunk occurs when a player jumps through the air and forces the ball downward through the hoop with one or both hands. On occasion, the player is often seen applying a downward force on the rim of the hoop or holding onto the rim of the hoop for a split second. In rare circumstances, the downward force applied to the hoop during a slam-dunk causes the backboard to shatter resulting in the backboard glass shattering. Needless to say, the experience not only provokes the spectator's attention, but also provides an uplifting adrenaline rush engulfing the audience's attention to the game. The dramatic sights and sounds of the event instill a heightened level of interest in replicating the shattering backboard event. As such, basketball enthusiasts' desire to simulate the shattering of a basketball backboard. What is desired is a basketball hoop that is designed to emulate the shattering of a backboard during a slam dunk of a ball through the hoop, is safe to use by children, is easy to assemble, and requires little effort in puzzling together backboard pieces for repeated use.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the described embodiments or the application and uses of the described embodiments. As used herein, the word “exemplary” or “illustrative” means “serving as an example, instance, or illustration.” Any implementation described herein as “exemplary” or “illustrative” is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations. All of the implementations described below are exemplary implementations provided to enable persons skilled in the art to make or use the embodiments of the disclosure and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure, which is defined by the claims. For purposes of description herein, the terms “upper,” “lower,” “left,” “rear,” “right,” “front,” “vertical,” “horizontal,” and derivatives thereof, shall relate to the invention as oriented in FIG. 1. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary or the following detailed description. It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes illustrated in the attached drawings, and described in the following specification, are simply exemplary embodiments of the inventive concepts defined in the appended claims. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics relating to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting, unless the claims expressly state otherwise. An exemplary basketball hoop device 100 is illustrated if FIGS. 1 through 4. The basketball hoop device 100 includes a generally, square frame 110, a hoop assembly 120 pivotally attached to the frame 110, and a plurality of backboard pieces 140-147 that are releasably disposed within a cavity 114. The frame 110 is constructed from a rigid, durable material such as plastic, wood, hard rubber, a composite material (such as fiberglass, Kevlar, and the like), or a padded metal (such as a lightweight aluminum, steel, and the like). The frame 110 includes a border disposed around the frame 110, and a rear panel 116 that together define a cavity 114 having a predetermined depth for releasably holding a plurality of backboard pieces 140-147 that are inter-fitted together like a puzzle to form a planar, backboard of the basketball hoop device 100. It is understood that although the present invention shows a generally square, frame 110, other geometric shapes may be contemplated such as round, oval or rectangular. The basketball hoop 100 can include exemplary mounting brackets 150, as best illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3. The mounting brackets 150 are secured to the frame 110 at a location proximate to each of the top corners of frame 110. In the exemplary embodiment, each bracket 150 is formed having an inverted U-shape configuration defining an adequate space 152 for hanging the basketball hoop device 100 on a top edge of a door. It would be understood by those skilled in the art that other mounting brackets may include other suitable fasteners used to secure the basketball hoop 100 on a horizontal or vertical surface as well. For example, other suitable fasteners may include any of nuts and bolts, clamps, magnets, plates and screws, hooks, suction cups, a dense hook and loop tape, or any other mechanical component. Alternatively, the basketball hoop 100 may include a vertically, adjustable stand or telescoping beam frame attached to a base to provide mobile movement of the hoop device 100. The basketball hoop 100 may be attached to other supports and stands that are well known in the art. Each backboard piece 140-147 may include the same or different geometrical shape. For example, to emulate the appearance of jagged pieces of glass, as when a real basketball backboard shatters, each piece 140-147 preferably includes a different geometrical shape and size, having irregular contour edges. Thus, pieces 140-147 may comprise triangles, hexagons, and pentagons shapes just to name a few. Pieces 140-147 are fitted or assembled together like a puzzle within the cavity 114. The assembled puzzle provides a planar, basketball backboard. With safety in mind, each piece 140-147 is preferably constructed from a soft foam material. Though other materials are contemplated for use as pieces 140-147, such as rubber, plastic or wood, the foam material does not pose a risk of danger to children during use. The thickness of each backboard piece 140-147 will correspond to the depth of the cavity 114. For example, a cavity 114 having a smaller depth requires backboard pieces 140-147 that are thinner. To enhance the aesthetic appearance of the basketball hoop 100, each backboard piece 140-147 may comprise the same or different color, and may also include markings, characters, symbols, or any other indicia printed or adhered thereon, if desired. In one non-limiting example, each backboard piece 140-147 may be numbered or include a letter to assist a child in assembling the pieces 140-147 together (see FIG. 9). In the preferred embodiment, the dimensional outline 160 of each piece is depicted on the rear panel 116 of the frame 110, as illustrated in FIG. 8. In this manner, a player (such as a child) can simply place each backboard piece 140-147 to the corresponding shape as outlined on rear panel 116. The backboard pieces 140-147 should be dimensionally constructed to provide friction fitting such that, when assembled together, the backboard pieces 140-147 having friction fitting allows the backboard pieces 140-147 to remain together without dislodging or falling as a result of gravity and/or slight movement. It is understood that a material can be applied to the mating sides, such as portions of the peripheral edges, of each of the backboard pieces 140-147 that has a coefficient of friction greater than that applied to non-mating sides of each of the backboard pieces 140-147. As shown, the basketball hoop 100 further includes a hoop assembly 120 including a hoop 122, mesh or netting 124 material suspended from the hoop 122, and a projecting assembly 130. In one non-limiting example, the circular hoop 122 is dimensioned to allow a ball to pass through with ease. Different types of balls may be used for play such as rubber balls, foam balls, plastic balls, and the like. The circular hoop 122 may be constructed from a durable material that is able to withstand repeated impact forces as a result of a ball impacting the hoop or due to forces exerted thereon by a person. The netting 124 is constructed from the well-known materials such as cotton, vinyl, or plastic. Alternatively, the netting 124 may be fabricated of a single formed section of plastic lattice that is designed to mimic the features of a real net. The netting 124 can be permanently attached to, or removably detached from, the hoop 122. As illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 4, the projecting assembly 130 is operatively attached to the frame 110. The projecting assembly 130 includes a support plate 119 attached to the rear panel 116 of frame 110 and disposed in a recess 117 formed in the rear panel 116 at the rear of and in communication with the cavity 114, a hoop plate 136 attached to the hoop 122 and pivotally attached to the support plate 119, a pair of spaced apart coil springs or spring mechanisms of a first bias member 134 coupled to the hoop plate 136, a second bias member 135, such as a coil spring or spring mechanism, coupled to the support plate 119 and the hoop plate 136, disposed between and spaced from the spring mechanisms of the first bias member 134 and configured to bias the hoop plate 136, and the hoop 122 therewith, to an upright position relative to the frame 110 (illustrated in FIGS. 1-4), and a projector 132 being provided in the form of an elongated member coupled to the hoop plate 136, via its attachment to the coil springs or spring mechanisms of the first bias member 134, and substantially disposed at a staged configuration in the recess 117 at the rear of the cavity 114 wherein the elongated member 132 is positioned separate from and unattached to the plurality of backboard pieces 140-147 and extends between the rear panel 116 and the plurality of backboard pieces, behind a majority of the plurality of backboard pieces. In one embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 1, the elongated member of the projector 132 takes the form of a meandering hollow or solid bar with lateral butterfly wing-shaped portions. In another embodiment, as illustrated in FIG. 10, the elongated member of the projector 232 takes the form of a flat metal or plastic plate that spans slightly less than the width and height of the cavity 214, having a uniform thickness and being in the general shape of the frame 210. (It should be understood that like features of the basketball hoop device 100 in FIGS. 1-8 and 200 in FIGS. 9 and 10 are numbered the same except preceded by the numeral ‘2” in FIGS. 9 and 10.) It is understood that the elongated member in the form of the butterfly wing-shaped projector 132 and plate projector 232 are merely exemplary embodiments and that the projector 132, 232 may be in any shape that is separated from and unattached to the plurality of backboard pieces 140-147 and positioned between the majority of the plurality of backboard pieces 140-147 (when the backboard pieces 140-147 are inserted into the cavity 114) and the rear panel 116, while being coupled to the hoop plate 136 via the first bias member 134 such that when force is applied to the hoop 122, the projector 132, 232 pivots with the hoop plate 136 to a deployed configuration where it is able to dislodge the pieces 140-147. When a momentary downward force is applied to the hoop 122, the hoop 122 swings, together with the hoop plate 136 and thus against the bias of the second bias member 135, relative to the support plate 119 from the upright position (illustrated in FIG. 4) to a downward position, wherein the hoop 122 is at an obtuse angle relative to the plane of the backboard (illustrated in FIG. 6). When the momentary downward force is released from the hoop 122, it swings back to the upright position, wherein the hoop 122 is perpendicular to the plane of the backboard (illustrated in FIG. 4). As the hoop 122 swings downwardly, the coil spring or spring mechanism of the second bias member 135 is stretched, allowing the hoop 122 to swing from the upright position into the downward position. However, the second bias member 135 is configured to resist the stretching, therefore, shortly after obtaining the downward position and upon the release of the application of the momentary downward force on the hoop 122, the reactive force of the second bias member 135 causes the hoop 122, and the hoop plate 136 therewith, to pivot relative to the support plate 119 back into the upright position. Concurrently, as the hoop 122 swings from the upright position into the downward sloping position, the projector 132 pivots away from the rear panel 116 of the frame 110 due to its coupling via the first bias member 134 with the hoop plate 136. As a result, the force of the projector 132 moving forward and downwardly away from the rear panel 116 dislodges the puzzle pieces 140-147 from the cavity 114 and projects them 140-147 forward away from the cavity 114. Gravity causes the puzzle pieces 140-147 to fall, thereby emulating the “shattering” of a basketball hoop backboard, as illustrated in FIG. 6. As illustrated in FIG. 4, a gap 118 is implemented between the rear surfaces of the plurality of background pieces 140-147 and the projector 132, the latter being substantially disposed in the recess 117 formed in the rear panel 116 in communication with the rear of the cavity 114. The gap 118 permits the hoop 122 to move slightly downwards, and thus the projector 132 slightly forwards, without necessarily causing the projector 132 to dislodge the plurality of backboard pieces 140-147. Thus, the hoop 122 has some leeway in pivoting downwards momentarily and the projector 132 in pivoting forwards without dislodging the foam backboard pieces 140-147. The gap 118 prevents a user from having to setup the backboard pieces 140-147 every single time a ball comes in contact with the hoop 122. Thus, the projector 132 dislodges the backboard pieces 140-147 only upon receiving a sufficient amount of force. Turning now to FIGS. 5 through 8, there are shown front, side and isometric views, of the basketball hoop device 100 showing a slam dunk force applied to the hoop 122 to simulate the shattering of a basketball backboard, in accordance with the present invention. When a dunking force is applied to the hoop 122, such as the force of a person pushing a ball through the hoop 122 to mimic a slam-dunk, the hoop 122 swings or rotates to the downward position. The dunking force overcomes a retaining force applied by the second bias member 135, causing the hoop 122 to pivot accordingly. The pivotal motion of the hoop 122 forces the projector 132 to pivotally swing away from the rear panel 116 of the frame 110. With the presence of a sufficient amount of downward force, the projector 132 pivots beyond the distance defined by the gap 118 to contact and apply an ejection force to the rear surfaces of the plurality of backboard pieces 140-147, and abruptly projecting the backboard pieces 140-147 out from cavity 114 of frame 110. The motion of the abruptly projected backboard pieces 140-147 simulates the shattering of a glass backboard, as best illustrated in FIGS. 6 and 8. With the downward force removed, the spring mechanism 135 biases the hoop 122 into an upright position perpendicular to the rear panel 116 of frame 110 and returning the biasing projector 132 into a vertical orientation against the rear panel 116; i.e. returning the biasing projector 132 to the upright position, wherein the biasing projector 132 is parallel to the rear panel 116 of the frame 110. A user simply picks up the ejected backboard pieces 140-147 and repositions them within cavity 114 of frame 110. Each backboard piece 140-147 can be aligned according to the corresponding shape depicted on the rear panel 116. It will be noted that the basketball hoop 100 of the present invention may include characters, or other indicia disposed on the outer surface of frame 110 as illustrated in FIG. 3. In one non-limiting example, words such as “Thunder” and “Dunker” may printed anywhere along the border of the frame 110. Further, the basketball hoop system 100 of the present invention may also include a locking mechanism used to selectively lock the hoop 122 in place thus preventing the projector 132 from engaging with the pieces 140-147 when a dunking force is applied to the hoop 122. It is understood that the basketball hoop 100 may be provided in any reasonable size, based upon the desired application. The basketball hoop 100 can be provided in a smaller size for an indoor application, such as a desktop toy, a trashcan mounted apparatus, an interior wall mounted assembly, a door mounted configuration, and the like. Since many modifications, variations, and changes in detail can be made to the described preferred embodiments of the invention, it is intended that all matters in the foregoing description and shown in the accompanying drawings be interpreted as illustrative and not in a limiting sense. Thus, the scope of the invention should be determined by the appended claims and their legal equivalence. 1.
