A METHOD TO PRODUCE 1, 1,2,3-TETRACHLOROPROPENE WITH HIGH YIELD CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION This application claims domestic priority from commonly owned, copending, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/972,673, filed 31 March 2014, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 8,058,486, the compound 1, 1,2,3-tetrachloro- propene (HCC-1230xa) is an important precursor that can be used for the production of 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene (HFO-1234yf), which is a low GWP molecule that can be used as an effective refrigerant, fire extinguishing agent, heat transfer medium, propellant, foaming agent, blowing agent, gaseous dielectric agent, sterilant carrier, polymerization medium, particulate removal fluid, carrier fluid, buffing abrasive agent, displacement drying agent and power cycle working fluid, to name but a few. HCC-1230xa can be made in a known four-step process, as follows: (1) CC14 + CH2=CH2 -> CC13-CH2-CH2C1 (2) CC13-CH2-CH2C1— > CC12=CH-CH2C1 +HC1 (3) CC12=CH-CH2C1 + Cl2— > CC13-CHC1-CH2C1 and (4) CC13-CHC1-CH2C1 -— > CC12=CC1-CH2C1 + HC1 As shown above, in Step 3 of this four-step process, 1, 1,3-trichloropropene (HCC-1240za) from Step 2 is used as the starting material, where HCC-1240za is chlorinated by Cl2 to form the intermediate product 1,1,1,2,3-pentachloropropane (HCC-240db) under specific reaction conditions: CC12=CH-CH2C1 (HCC-1240za) + Cl2— > CC13-CHC1-CH2C1 (HCC-240db) Then, HCC-240db is dehydrochlorinated by a catalyst (such as FeCl3 or equivalents) to form HCC-1230xa and HC1 in Step 4: CC13-CHC1-CH2C1 (HCC-240db) — -> CC12=CC1-CH2C1 (HCC-1230xa) + HC1 In normal practice, the crude product from the third step is used directly as the starting material for the fourth step reaction without further purification. In this invention, it has been found that the crude HCC-240db containing HCC-1240za from the Step 3 reaction and/or HCC-250fb (1,1, 1,3-tetrachloropropane) carried over from the Step 2 distillation, inhibited the conversion of HCC-240db to HCC-1230xa in the Step 4 reaction. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based on the discovery that, when using HCC-240db containing different concentrations of HCC-1240za and HCC-250fb as the starting material to make HCC-1230xa, the amounts of HCC-1240za and HCC-250fb in the starting material have significant impact on HCC-240db conversion in the Step 4 reaction of HCC-240db to HCC-1230xa. Thus, one embodiment of the present invention is a process for the dehydrochlorination of HCC-240db to produce HCC-1230xa in high yield comprising the steps of: (1) CC14 + CH2=CH2 -> CC13-CH2-CH2C1 (2) CC13-CH2-CH2C1— > CC12=CH-CH2C1 +HC1 (3) CC12=CH-CH2C1 + Cl2— > CC13-CHC1-CH2C1 and (4) CC13-CHC1-CH2C1 -— > CC12=CC1-CH2C1 + HC1 wherein the crude HCC-240db in the Step (4) reaction contains less than 0.5 wt% of impurities selected from the group consisting of HCC-250fb, HCC-1240za, and mixtures thereof. The terms high yield, as used herein, mean at least 85% yield, preferably at least 90% percent yield, more preferably at least 95% yield, and most preferably at least 98% yield. In certain embodiments, the reaction takes place in a liquid phase reactor in the presence of caustic solution or a dehydrochlorination catalyst. In certain embodiments, the dehydrochlorination catalyst comprises one or more metal halides such as FeCl3, A1C13, and the like. In certain embodiments, the crude HCC-240db from Step 3 reaction is used directly as the starting material. In certain embodiments, the combined HCC-1240za and HCC-250fb concentration in the crude HCC-240db starting material is less than 0.5 wt% to gain high yield on HCC-1230xa. In certain embodiments, crude HCC-240db containing over 0.5 wt% of HCC- 1240za/HCC-250fb must first be purified to remove impurities selected from the group consisting of HCC-250fb, HCC-1240za, and mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, vacuum distillation or another purification method is used to remove the impurities HCC-1240za and/or HCC-250f from the crude HCC- 240db. Examples of other purification methods include distillations under elevated or atmospheric pressure, adsorption with activated carbon/molecular sieves/resins, and the like. It should be appreciated by those persons having ordinary skill in the art(s) to which the present invention relates that any of the features described herein in respect of any particular aspect and/or embodiment of the present invention can be combined with one or more of any of the other features of any other aspects and/or embodiments of the present invention described herein, with modifications as appropriate to ensure compatibility of the combinations. Such combinations are considered to be part of the present invention contemplated by this disclosure. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention as claimed. Other embodiments will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification and practice of the invention disclosed herein. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As described above, in order to obtain a high yield of HCC-1230xa from the known four step reactions, the Step 3 crude product (crude HCC-240db) is used directly as the starting material in Step 4 reaction if the crude HCC-240db contains less than 0.5 wt% of impurities selected from the group consisting of HCC-250fb, HCC-1240za, and mixtures thereof. However, a purification process (such as vacuum distillation) is implemented to remove the HCC-1240za and/or HCC-250fb impurities from the crude HCC-240db, if it contains more than 0.5 wt% of HCC-1240za and/or HCC-250f prior to the Step (4) reaction, if high yields of HCC-1230xa are to be achieved. In one example, at 120°C, with 1.0 wt% of FeCi3 and 2 hours of residence time, only 14.7 mol% of HCC-240db conversion was observed. With the residence time extended to 6 hours, the HCC-240db conversion was improved marginally to 16.6 mol%. Both examples used a crude HCC-240db containing 2.0 wt% of 1240za, 2.3 wt% 250f and 92.5 wt% 240db. Increasing reaction temperature to 140°C and FeCi3 concentration to 2.0 wt% improved HCC-240db conversion (54.9 mol%), but still at very low level. With HCC-1240za and HCC-250fb being removed from the above starting material by vacuum distillation, at 120°C, with 1.0 wt% of FeCi3 and 2 hours of residence time, HCC-240db conversion was significantly increased to 99.3 mol%. It was thus concluded that the existence of impurities selected from the group consisting of HCC-250fb, HCC-1240za, and mixtures thereof in Step 3 crude product inhibits the dehydrochlorination of HCC-240db, causing a low yield to HCC-1230xa. Due to the fact that HCC-250f is dehydrochlorinated by FeCl3 to form HCC- 1240za during Step 4 reaction, and HCC-1240za is further dimerized in the process, it is also possible that the products of HCC-1240za dimerization (pentachlorocyclohexene and/or hexachlorocyclohexane isomers) have the similar impact on HCC-240db conversion. In order to gain high HCC-1230xa yield (or high HCC-240db conversion) in the dehydrochlorination of HCC-240db to produce HCC-1230xa, the starting material of the Step 3 reaction is HCC-250fb free (< 0.5 wt%). On the other hand, the Step 3 reaction is controlled to have HCC-1240za fully converted with HCC-1240za concentration in the crude product less than 0.5 wt% in order to use the Step 3 crude product directly in Step 4 without purification. If the total concentration of the impurities selected from the group consisting of HCC-250fb, HCC-1240za, and mixtures thereof in the Step 3 crude product is higher than 0.5 wt%, the crude product is purified to remove the HCC-1240za and HCC-250fb impurities using known separation methods such as vacuum distillation and the like.
