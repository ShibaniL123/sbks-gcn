FIELD The disclosure relates to a breathable structural web-forming apparatus and a breathable structural web having at least a layer of a non-woven membrane and a layered structure including a base layer portion and a plurality of hollow protrusions protruding from the base layer portion. BACKGROUND Non-woven membranes are made from polymers through techniques, such as melt blown or melt spun techniques. In melt blown techniques, molten fibers are formed and are discharged from a spinneret, and are stacked and bonded together to form the non-woven membrane. The non-woven membrane thus formed has a plurality of pores, which renders the non-woven membrane to be permeable to air and water and useful in applications, such as diapers, napkins, cloths, filters, etc.. However, the pores in the non-woven membrane are randomly formed, have various sizes, and do not have a defined directivity for flow of water or liquid, which limits the application of the non-woven membrane. SUMMARY Therefore, an object of the disclosure is to provide a breathable structural web that can overcome the aforesaid drawback associated with the prior art. According to one aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a breathable structural web that comprises a layered structure including at least a layer of a non-woven material.

The hollow protrusions are scattered among the indented portions. According to another aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a breathable diaper that comprises the aforesaid breathable structural web and an absorbent stacked on the breathable structural web. According to yet another aspect of the disclosure, there is provided a breathable structural web-forming apparatus that comprises: a rotary member defining a rotation axis and rotatable about the rotation axis; a screen mold supported on the rotary member and co-rotatable with the rotary member, the screen mold including a screen body and a plurality of tapered projections, the screen body having first and second sides and a plurality of screen holes, the tapered projections protruding and being tapered from the first side of the screen body; a spinneret that is disposed adjacent to the first side of the screen body and opposite to the second side of the screen body, and that is configured to discharge molten fibers toward the first side of the screen body; and a suction box that is disposed adjacent to the second side of the screen body and opposite to the first side of the screen body, and that is configured to draw the molten fibers to fit into the screen holes.

The advantages of the breathable structural web of the disclosure may be better illustrated in the following applications. Fig. 24 illustrates an application of the breathable structural web according to the disclosure in a diaper. The diaper includes first and second breathable structural webs and an absorbent 9. Each of the first and second breathable structural webs has a layered structure 8 the same as that of the first embodiment. The absorbent 9 is stacked on and is sandwiched between the layered structures 8 of the first and second breathable structural webs. Each of the first hollow protrusions 83 of the layered structure 8 of the first breathable structural web is aligned with a respective one of the first hollow protrusions 83 of the layered structure 8 of the second breathable structural web along a normal direction normal to the first and second breathable structural webs. The small-diameter open ends 834 of the first hollow protrusions 83 of the layered structures 8 of the first breathable structural web are in contact with one side of the absorbent 9 and the small-diameter open ends 834 of the first hollow protrusions 83 of the layered structures 8 of the second breathable structural web are in contact with the other side of the absorbent 9 that is opposite to the one side of the absorbent. The indented portions 82 of the layered structure 8 of the first breathable structural web are to be brought into contact with the skin of the user. As such, the base layer portion 81 of the layered structure 8 of the first breathable structural web is spaced apart from (i.e., free from contact with) the skin of the user by the indented portions of the layered structure 8 of the first breathable structural web, thereby permitting reduction of the contact area between the diaper and the skin of the user. The first hollow protrusions 83 of the layered structure 8 have a gradually reduced diameter, so that air and/or vapor are permitted to pass therethrough while liquid is prevented from passing therethrough, thereby keeping the user in a dry and comfortable state. It is noted that during urination, urine may pass through pores in the layered structure 8 of the first breathable structural web, is absorbed by the absorbent 9, and is prevented from re-wetting the skin of the user by passing through the base layer portion 81, the first hollow protrusions 83 and the indented portions 82 of the layered structure 8 of the first breathable structural web. Fig. 25 illustrates a diaper modified from the diaper of Fig. 24. The diaper of Fig. 25 differs from the diaper of Fig. 24 in that each of the first hollow protrusions 83 of the layered structure 8 of the first breathable structural web is misaligned with the respective one of the first hollow protrusions 83 of the layered structure 8 of the second breathable structural web along the normal direction.
