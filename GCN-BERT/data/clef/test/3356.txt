MICELLAR NANOPARTICLES CONTAINING ANTITUMORAL GLYCOSIDES FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to micelles comprising nanoparticles and a coating comprising glycoside derivatives, the process of obtaining of said micelles, as well as the use thereof in the treatment of cancer. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Glycoside derivatives conjugated to a hydrophobic moiety have been described as having antitumor activity in different tumoral cell lines such as glioma, lung carcinoma and melanoma [Garcia-Alvarez I. et al, J. Med. Chem. 2011, 54, 6949-6955; Garcia-Alvarez I. et al, J. Med. Chem. 2007, 50, 364-373; and Fernandez-Mayoralas A. et al, J. Med. Chem. 2003, 46, 1286- 1288]. However, these compounds generally show poor water solubility, rendering them less suitable as therapeutic agents. Functionalized magnetic nanoparticles have been described for delivery of water insoluble anticancer agents. Jain T.K. et al. [Molecular Pharmaceutics, 2005, 2, 193-205] discloses water dispersible oleic acid-Pluronic-coated iron oxide magnetic nanoparticle formulations as a universal drug carrier system for systemic administration of water insoluble drugs, such as water insoluble anticancer agents. The Pluronic coating provides water solubility to the iron oxide nanoparticles, which may be then loaded with the water insoluble drug. The hydrophobic drug is partitioned in the oleic acid shell surrounding the iron oxide nanoparticles. However, the presence of the Pluronic coating is necessary for achieving the solubilization of the drug. Lee CM. et al [Bioconjugate Chemistry, 2011, 22, 186-192] discloses oleic acid decorated iron oxide nanoparticles encapsulated with oleic acid conjugated chitosan, which tend to accumulate in tumors and form micelles having a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic shell structure in aqueous solutions. Oleyl-chitosan self-aggregates in a structure comprising a hydrophobic core, wherein the iron oxide nanoparticles and the hydrophobic drug may be loaded, and a hydrophilic shell. However, the presence of the oleyl-chitosan coating is necessary for achieving the solubilization of the drug. In addition, magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with glycoside derivatives and therapeutic agents have been described in the prior art for enhancing tumor accumulation of the therapeutic agent without disclosing any improvement of the water solubility of said therapeutic agents. Document WO 2009/123734 discloses magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with 2- deoxyglucose, which may additionally comprise a therapeutic agent for the treatment of several diseases. Said 2-deoxyglucose functionalized nanoparticles may exhibit a greater metabolic uptake into cancerous tissue. Document WO 2011/107290 discloses magnetic nanoparticles functionalized by a ligand that is adequate for internalization into cancerous cells, such as a monosaccharide (for example glucose), dextrane, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinylalcohol, oleic acid or combinations thereof. Said functionalized nanoparticles may be used for cancer diagnosis and treatment purposes. Document WO 2011/095661 discloses magnetic nanoparticles in combination with an active ingredient for the treatment of cancer. Due to the magnetic nature of the nanoparticles, they allow the concentration of the active ingredient in specific locations of the body once they have been administered to the patient. Even though solubilization of water insoluble drugs has been described in the prior art in systems comprising nanoparticles, the presence of an amphiphilic polymer is necessary for achieving this goal. Moreover, in the prior art, glycosides are either covalently attached to the coating (in this case they are participating to the solubilization of the nanoparticles probe but do not act as drug) or encapsulated as a drug in a micelle, but then they do not participate in the solubilization. Thus, there remains a need to develop a simple system that allows the solubilization of glycoside derivatives having anticancer activity. The authors of the present invention have solved this need by providing a micelle comprising a nanoparticle core and glycoside derivative coating, which are bonded by hydrophobic interactions. In some cases, the use of such a system provides an increase in the antitumoral activity of the glycoside derivatives.

The term "first member of a hydrophobic interaction pair" refers to the member of the hydrophobic interaction pair that is present in the outer layer of the nanoparticles and comprises a polar head and a nonpolar tail. The polar head of the first member of the hydrophobic interaction pair, preferably a -COOH moiety, interacts ionically/covalently with the surface of the core of the nanoparticles, whereas the nonpolar tail of the first member of the hydrophobic interaction pair, preferably a fatty acid radical, interacts hydrophobically with the second member of the hydrophobic interaction pair, i.e. R5 in the glycoside derivative of formula (I) as defined above. Preferably, the first member of the hydrophobic interaction pair is a fatty acid as defined above; even more preferably a Cs-C3o alkenyl-COOH fatty acid as defined above; more preferably the first member of the hydrophobic interaction pair is selected from the group consisting of oleic acid, myristoleic acid, palmitoleic acid and sapienic acid; still more preferably, the first member of the hydrophobic interaction pair is oleic acid. The term "second member of a hydrophobic interaction pair" refers to the member of the hydrophobic interaction pair that is present in the glycoside derivatives of formula (I) as substituent R5. R5 is a fatty acid radical as defined above, i.e. as Cs-C3o alkyl or Cs-C3o alkenyl, as defined above. Preferably the second member of the hydrophobic interaction pair is selected from the group consisting of oleyl, octyl, myristoleyl, palmitoleyl and sapienyl; more preferably, the second member of the hydrophobic interaction pair is selected from oleyl and octyl; even more preferably the second member of the hydrophobic interaction pair is oleyl. The first and second member of the hydrophobic interaction pair may be the same or may be different. When the first and second members of the hydrophobic interaction pair are a fatty acid and a fatty acid radical, respectively, the "same" is to be understood as the fatty acid and radical derived from said fatty acid, for example oleic acid and oleyl. When the first and second members of the hydrophobic interaction pair are a fatty acid and a fatty acid radical, respectively, "different" is to be understood as the fatty acid and radical derived from another fatty acid, for example oleic acid and octyl.

A micelle is formed due to the hydrophobic interaction of the first and second members of the hydrophobic interaction pair. Thus, said micelle comprises the core of the nanoparticle surrounded by an outer layer that comprises the first member of the hydrophobic interaction pair, which is hydrophobically bound (i.e. by van der Waals interaction) to the second member of the hydrophobic interaction pair, thus, forming a coating of glycoside derivatives of formula (I) on the surface of the outer layer of the nanoparticles. Thus, the micelle comprises, from inwards to outwards, the nanoparticle core, an outer layer surrounding said nanoparticle core, and a coating comprising the glycoside derivatives of formula (I). Since the group R5 of the glycoside derivative of formula (I), i.e. the second member of the hydrophobic interaction pair, interacts with the outer layer of the nanoparticles, the remaining part of the glycoside derivative of formula (I) (the part of the molecule that is not R5) forms the outer surface of the micelle and presents a hydrophilic character. The glycoside derivative of formula (I), as defined above, forms the coating of the micelle. Any compound referred to herein is intended to represent such specific compound as well as certain variations or forms. In particular, compounds referred to herein may have asymmetric centres and therefore exist in different enantiomeric forms.

The term "hydrodynamic size" of the micelle refers to the diameter of the nanoparticles plus the surfactant and the glycoside derivative (or coating). The hydrodynamic size is determined for nanoparticles or micelles in suspension in an electrolyte.

A first monolayer of ions of the opposing sign electrostatically bound to the nanoparticle or micelle and a surrounding area of enveloping solution that has an excess of ions having the sign opposite that of the nanoparticle or micelle, outside this area the concentration of ions being constant at all points and equal to that of the electrolyte. The diameter of the monolayer and the enveloping area is the hydrodynamic size. The size is measured in 10 mM phosphate buffer at 25°C, pH 7.1, in a Malvern Zetasizer nanoZS.

A first monolayer of ions of the opposing sign electrostatically bound to the micelle and a surrounding area of enveloping solution having an excess of ions having the sign opposite that of the micelle, outside this area the concentration of ions being constant at all points and equal to that of the electrolyte. The difference in potential between the monolayer and the enveloping area is the zeta potential. The zeta potential determines the degree of repulsion between adjacent micelles having a charge of the same sign. If it drops by more than a specific value, the attractive forces exceed the repulsive forces, and the micelle aggregate. The potential was measured in solutions of the micelles with 0.01 M K O3, measuring the electrophoretic mobility in a Malvern Zetasizer nanoZS.

The term "transversal relaxivity" or r2 and the term "longitudinal relaxivity" or ri refer to a measurement of the capability of micelles to decrease the transversal relaxation time (T2) and longitudinal relaxation time (Ti), respectively, of the surrounding protons per unit of iron concentration. This capability is relevant in designing contrast agents for diagnostic imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses the magnetic spins of hydrogen nuclei aligned by an external magnetic field. A radio frequency pulse disrupts the alignment of spins in equilibrium, relaxation of the spin back to equilibrium is monitored at a high temporal resolution. Two relaxation processes take place, longitudinal relaxation (Ti) and transversal relaxation (T2). The preceding relaxation processes can be monitored independently to generate different magnetic resonance images. Local variations in the proton spin density, largely attributed to water molecules and caused by changes in the biological environment, affect the relaxation responses from which images can be constructed. Iron oxide nanoparticles affect the transverse relaxation time (T2) of water. These relaxivity values vary depending on micelle size. The transversal and longitudinal relaxivities are determined by using a Bruker minispec mq60 relaxo meter with a field of 1.5 T. In a particular embodiment, the micelles are monodisperse micelles. The term "monodisperse" refers to micelles having a PDI (polydispersivity index) value equal to or less than 0.30, preferably equal or less to 0.25, more preferably equal or less to 0.20, i.e., they have substantially the same hydrodynamic size, wherein at least 70% of the micelles have the same size, preferably at least 75%, more preferably at least 80%, respectively. A variation of ± 30% of the defined hydrodynamic size, preferably ± 25%, more preferably ± 20%, must be understood as "substantially the same hydrodynamic size". In a preferred embodiment, in the micelle according to the present invention, the concentration (in mg/mL) of the glycoside derivative of formula (I) to the concentration (in mg/mL) of the main metal comprising in the nanoparticles core (in the examples it is iron) is in the range of l : l to 50: l, preferably from 3: 1 to 50:1, more preferably from 5: 1 to 50: 1, still more preferably from 10: 1 to 5: 1. Process for the preparation of micelles comprising nanoparticles In another aspect, the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a micelle as defined above which comprises: a) providing one or more nanoparticles comprising a core and an outer layer as defined in above; b) providing glycoside derivatives of formula (I) as defined above; and c) mixing the nanoparticles of step a) and the glycoside derivatives of step b) under conditions adequate for the formation of hydrophobic interactions between the first member of the hydrophobic interaction pair of the outer layer of the nanoparticles and the R5 groups in the glycoside derivatives. The first step of the process, step a), consists of providing one or more nanoparticles comprising a core and an outer layer according to the present invention. The core of the nanoparticles can be iron oxide, UCNP and metals, as previously defined; preferably the core is an iron oxide core, as previously defined, still more preferably an iron oxide core selected from Fe304 and y-Fe203. The outer layer of the nanoparticles comprises the first member of a hydrophobic interaction pair, as defined above. The nanoparticles having an iron oxide core and an outer layer, as previously defined, used in step a) can be obtained by methods known by the person skilled in the art and described in the state of the art. An example of such methods is the co -precipitation in aqueous medium, wherein ferric and ferrous ions are mixed in highly basic solutions at room temperature or at a high temperature, said co-precipitation can be performed in the presence of a protective agent or surfactant or the nanoparticles obtained can subsequently be coated with said protective agent or surfactant. Another usual method for obtaining iron oxide nanoparticles is thermal decomposition of organic iron compounds, such as iron N-nitrosophenylhydroxylamine (Fe(cup)3), iron acetylacetonate (Fe(acac)3), iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)s), iron trichloride (FeCl3), iron oleate, and sodium oleate/iron trichloride, at a high temperature. Thermal decomposition is generally performed in the presence of a surfactant. Another usual method for synthesizing iron oxide nanoparticles is sonochemical synthesis, wherein the iron precursors are broken down by the action of a high frequency (for example 20 KHz to 10 MHz). The nanoparticles having a UCNP core and an outer layer, as previously defined, used in step a) can be obtained by methods known by the person skilled in the art and described in the state of the art. An example of such methods is the hydro(solvo)thermal synthesis in aqueous medium, wherein rare-earth precursors and fluoride precursors are mixed in high pressurized and high temperature autoclave. Said rare-earth precursors can be nitrates, oxides, chlorides and, more often, fluorines. Said fluoride precursors can be HF, NH4F, NH4HF2, NaBF4, KBF4, NaF, KF, etc. Another usual method for obtaining UCNP nanoparticles is thermal decomposition procedure where the metal trifluoroacetates are thermally decomposed generally in the presence of a surfactant mixture (oleic acid, octadecene, trioctylphosphine, etc). Organic lanthanide chloro -precursors can be as well used in this method in combination with a fluoride source such as NaF. Other methods investigates preparation of UCNP nanoparticles by phase transfer liquid, solid and solution phases ie LSS method, microwave irradiation, etc. Addition of inorganic layer of the same material without the dopant (as described above) around the first core, is usually achieved mimicking the same method used in presence of the single core nanoparticles.

Characterization of micelles Example 4: In vitro activity of the micelles, inhibition of A549 and C6 tumor cell proliferation Human A549 cell line and C6 rat glioma cell line were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) complete medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS, 10%; GLinus, Madrid, Spain), glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (50 IU/mL), and streptomycin (50 mg/mL), at 37 °C in a 5% C02 humidified atmosphere. Exponentially growing cells were seeded on 96-well plates (Beckton Dickinson, Le Pont de Claix, France), in DMEM complete medium, at a density of 1.5 x 104 cells/well for C6 cell and 5 x 103 cells/well for A549 cells respectively. The cells were allowed to attach with 5% of C02 at 37°C for overnight, and then, to serum starve the cells, the medium was replaced by 100 of fresh DMEM without FBS and maintained overnight. Stock solutions in EtOH of the glycoside derivatives of formula (I) of Example 2 (50 mM) or stock solutions in PBS of the micelles of Example 3 were finally dissolved in DMEM complete medium for the treatments.

Inhibitory activities of the single glycosides with respect to their molar concentration against C6 glioma and A549 alveolar tumor cell lines are shown respectively in Figure 3A and Figure 4A. Inhibitory activities of the micelles with respect to their concentration against C6 glioma tumor cell line are shown in Figures 3B-3D. Inhibitory activities of the micelles with respect to their molar concentration against A549 alveolar tumoral cell line are shown in Figures 4B-4D. As it can be seen, micelles of Example 3 (GC22-NP, TFAGC22-NP or IG20-NP) inhibit proliferation of A549 and C6 tumor cells. Surprisingly, in the case of IG20-NP micelles are inhibitors or tumor cell proliferation in C6 cells, whereas glycoside IG20 per se did not show inhibition of C6 cell proliferation. Moreover, micelles IG20-NP are more active as inhibitors or tumor cell proliferation in A549 cells than glycoside IG20 per se. It can also be seen that when the biological activity is determined in the presence of magnetic field the results are worse. This maybe because the magnet attracts straight away the NPs in the center of the plate thus they cannot disperse in all the plate where there is the cell culture. Example 5: GC22-NP kinetic of elimination in rat's liver after intravenous administration (i.v.a) Rat (n = 1, Wistar, 350 g) was anesthetized with 2% isoflurane in a mixture of N2/02 (80:20). Baseline images were acquired before the intravenous administration of 300 μΐ, [Fe]=1.5 mg.ml"1 of micelles comprising glycoside derivative GC22 obtained in Example 3 (GC22-NP). Magnetic resonance images of the rat's liver were acquired at different times, from 5 minutes up to 1 hour after the injection. Specific region of interests (ROI) were selected and the reduction of the signal measured. After normalization to the baseline, curve representing the kinetic of elimination of the liver was represented (Figure 5). Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) protocol. The images were acquired with a 7 T Biospec MRI spectrometer (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany), using a transmitter/receiver quadrature coil of 25 mm inner diameter (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany). Rat was kept anaesthetized with 2% isoflurane in a mixture of N2/02 (80:20) via facial mask and placed prone in a custom-built plastic holder. The body temperature was kept constant using warm circulating water and the respiratory cycle was monitored constantly. 8 axial slices of 1 mm thickness were acquired to image the liver. The acquisition was performed in free-breathing animals, using a FLASH sequence. Example 6: Solubility For GC-22 and TFA-GC22, the glycosides alone are not soluble in pure water, while the micelles GC-22-NPs and TFA-GC22-NPs are stable in the aqueous phase.

Only IG-20 is soluble in water (but in the case of this one, bioactivity is increased so this is other advantage in this case).
