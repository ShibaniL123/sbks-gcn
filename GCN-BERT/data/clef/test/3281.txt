THECNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a ski binding device for fastening a ski mountaineering boot on a downhill ski or the like. BACKGROUND ART As known, the most common ski mountaineering boots substantially consist of a shell made of rigid plastic material which is shaped so as to accommodate the user's foot, and is provided on the bottom with a front sole and a rear heel, usually provided with a lugged profile and made of a non-slip elastomeric material; with a cuff made of a rigid plastic material, which is C-shaped so as to envelop the user's ankle from behind, and is hinged to the upper part of the shell so as to oscillate about a transversal reference axis substantially coinciding with the articulation axis of the ankle; with an inner shoe made of soft, heat-insulating material, which is removably inserted into the shell and the cuff, and is shaped so as to envelop and protect both the foot and the lower part of the user's leg; and with a series of manually-operated closing hooks, which are appropriately distributed on the shell and on the cuff, and are structured so as to tighten the shell and the cuff in order to immobilize the user's leg inside the shoe. The shell of ski mountaineering boots is usually provided on the front with a small, substantially duck-billed projecting appendix, which protrudes from the nose-shaped tip of the shell remaining locally substantially coplanar with the front sole, and is structured so as to be coupled in rigid, stable, although easily releasable manner, with the toepiece of the ski mountaineering binding device which, in turn, is rigidly fixed onto the central part of the downhill ski. The ski mountaineering binding device instead consists of a toepiece and a heelpiece, which are rigidly and stably fixed to the back of the downhill ski, at a predetermined distance from each other, and are structured so as to alternatively and as desired: lock the shell of the ski boot onto the back of the ski, thus preventing any relative movement between the two elements; orlock the shell of the ski boot onto the back of the ski thus allowing the boot to freely oscillate/pivot with respect to the ski about a transversal rotation axis arranged horizontally and roughly positioned at the duck-billed appendix of the shell. Obviously, the rotation axis of the ski boot is perpendicular to the rotation axis of the downhill ski, i.e. is oriented so as to be locally substantially perpendicular both to the middle plane of the ski and to the middle plane of the ski boot. In particular, the toepiece is usually provided with a gripper-like clamping member, which is structured so as to clamp and stably retain the projecting duck-billed appendix of the shell, while allowing the shell to freely oscillate/pivot with respect to the ski underneath about the rotation axis of the boot. The heelpiece of the binding device, instead, is structured so as to selectively hook and lock the rear part of the shell, so as to selectively prevent the boot from rotating by pivoting on the toepiece and moving the heel away from the back of the ski. More in detail, the heelpiece is usually provided with a pair of projecting pins which jut out from the turret towards the toepiece, next to each other, from opposite sides of the middle plane of the turret, while remaining locally substantially parallel to a reference axis which is locally substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the ski. The ends of the two projecting pins are structured so as to engage the rear part of the shell, roughly at the heel, so as to stably hold the heel of the ski boot in abutment on, or however close to, the back of the ski, thus preventing the ski boot from rotating on the toepiece. In order to allow the automatic unlocking of the binding device if the skier falls, the two projecting pins are structured so as to be elastically spread, in the presence of particularly strong pulse-like mechanical stresses, elastically by a few degrees with respect to each other, while always remaining on a horizontal laying plane locally perpendicular to the middle plane of the turret. Unfortunately, the above-described automatic unlocking system is not very sensitive to pulse-like mechanical stresses with an inclination angle larger than 10-15Â° with respect to the vertical. Documents EP0519243 and WO2009/105866 disclose ski bindings according to the preamble of claim 1. DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION It is the object of the present invention to provide a ski mountaineering binding device in which the heelpiece is capable of timely, automatically releasing the rear part of the ski boot even in the presence of pulse-like mechanical stresses strongly inclined with respect to the vertical, thus making the ski mountaineering binding device simpler and more immediate to be use. In accordance with these objectives, according to the present invention, a binding device is made for fastening a ski mountaineering boot to a downhill ski or the like, as set forth in claim 1 and preferably, but not necessarily, in any one of the dependent claims.

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION With reference to figure 1, numeral 1 indicates as a whole a ski mountaineering binding device specifically structured to fasten a ski mountaineering or Telemark ski boot 2 onto the central segment of a downhill ski 3, ski mountaineering ski or the like, of the known type, in a stable, although easily releasable manner. More in detail, the binding device 1 is structured to fasten a ski mountaineering or Telemark ski boot 2 of known type onto the central segment of a downhill ski 3 or the like, which ski boot is provided with a rigid lower shell 4 made of plastic and/or composite material, which is shaped so as to accommodate the user's foot, and is further provided on the bottom with a front sole 5 and a rear heel 6, which preferably, but not necessarily have a lugged profile and are preferably, but not necessarily, made of a non-slip elastomeric material. Furthermore, the shell 4 is also provided in the front with a small, substantially duck-billed appendix 7, which protrudes from the nose-shaped tip of the shell 4 while remaining locally substantially coplanar to the front sole 5, and is structured so as to be coupled/hooked to the binding device 1 which, in turn, is rigidly fixed to the central segment of the downhill ski 3. With particular reference to figure 1, in the example shown, the ski boot 2, in addition to the shell 4, also comprises a rigid cuff 8 made of a plastic and/or composite material, which is substantially C-shaped so as to envelop the user's ankle from behind, and is hinged onto the upper part of the shell 4 so as to freely oscillate about a transversal reference axis, which is substantially perpendicular to the middle plane of the ski boot (i.e. perpendicular to the sheet plane in figure 1), and also substantially and locally coincides with the articulation axis of the user's ankle; an inner shoe made of a soft, heat-insulating material, which is removably inserted into shell 4 and cuff 8, and is shaped so as to envelop and protect both the foot and the lower part of the user's leg; and a series of manually-operated closing hooks, which are positioned on the shell 4 and on the cuff 8, and are structured so as to tighten the shell 4 and the cuff 8 so as to immobilize the user's leg in the shoe 8. Additionally, shell 4 is finally, preferably but not necessarily, provided with a transversal stiffening bar (not shown) made of a metal material, which extends into the projecting duck-billed appendix 7 while remaining locally substantially perpendicular to the middle plane of the ski boot, and has its two axial ends which emerge/surface from the outside of the projecting appendix 7 at the two side edges of the same appendix. With reference to figure 1, the ski mountaineering binding device 1 instead consists of a toepiece 10 and a heelpiece 11 which are rigidly fixed onto the back of the central segment of the downhill ski 3, aligned along the longitudinal axis L of ski 3, at a predetermined distance from each other, and are structured so as to selectively clamp/hook and retain the front part and the rear part of shell 4, respectively. More in detail, the toepiece 10 and the heelpiece 11 of the ski mountaineering binding device 1 are structured so as to selectively and as desired: stably clamp and retain the front part and the rear part of shell 4 on the central segment of ski 3, thus maintaining the shell 4 immobile on the ski 3 with the sole 5 substantially parallel to the back of the downhill ski 3; orstably clamp and retain only the front part of shell 4 on the central segment of ski 3, while allowing the ski boot 2 to freely oscillate/pivot on the back of the ski 3 about a substantially horizontal rotation axis A, which is positioned immediately over the ski 3, at or however close to the tip of shell 4, and is substantially and locally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis L of ski 3 and to the middle plane of the ski boot 2. In other words, toepiece 10 is provided with a gripper-like clamping member 12 or the like which is structured so as to selectively clamp and retain only the front part of the shell 4, while allowing the front part of the shell 4 to freely oscillate/pivot on the toepiece 10 about the rotation axis A of the ski boot. Heelpiece 11 is instead structured so as to selectively hook and lock/retain the rear part of the shell 4 roughly at the heel, so as to stably retain the heel 6 of the ski boot 2 in abutment on, or however close to, the back of the ski 3, and therefore prevent any rotation of the ski boot 2 on the toepiece 10 about the rotation axis A of the ski boot. With reference to figure 1, in the example shown, the clamping member 12 of the toepiece 10 is structured so as to tighten the side edges of the projecting appendix 7 of the shell, thus being in abutment on the projecting appendix 7 at the two axial ends of the transversal stiffening bar possibly embedded in the appendix itself, while allowing the projecting appendix 7 of the shell to freely oscillate/pivot with respect to the toepiece 10 at the contact points between the gripper-like clamping member 12 and the side edges of the projecting appendix 7. In other words, the rotation axis A of the ski boot is positioned on the projecting appendix 7 of shell 4, at the contact points between the gripper-like clamping member 12 and the side edges of the projecting appendix 7. Furthermore, when the front part of shell 4 is fixed onto the toepiece 10 by means of the clamping member 12, the longitudinal axis of the transversal stiffening bar of the projecting appendix 7, if present, coincides with the rotation axis of the ski boot 2. The toepiece 10 of the ski mountaineering binding device 1 is a component widely known in the field and will not be further described. With reference to figures 1, 2 and 3, the heelpiece 11 of the ski mountaineering binding device 1 comprises instead a fastening plate or base 13 which is structured so as to be rigidly fastened to the back of the downhill ski 3 or the like; and a turret 14 which protrudes upwards from the upper face of the fastening plate 13, parallel to a reference axis B which is preferably, but not necessarily, locally substantially perpendicular to the laying plane of the fastening plate 13, i.e. is locally substantially perpendicular to the back of the ski 3 itself and to the longitudinal ski axis L. Furthermore, heelpiece 11 comprises a hooking projecting appendix 15 which juts out from the turret 14 towards the toepiece 10, and is structured so as to hook/couple to the rear part of the shell 4 roughly at the heel, so as to stably retain the heel 6 of the ski boot 2 in abutment on, or however close to, the back of the ski 3, thus preventing any rotation of the ski boot 2 on the toepiece 10 about the rotation axis A of the boot. More in detail, the hooking projecting appendix 15 juts out from the turret 14 remaining locally substantially parallel to a reference axis C which is preferably arranged locally substantially parallel to, or however aligned with, the longitudinal axis L of ski 3, and is shaped/structured so as to reach and engage the rear part of the shell 4 to stably retain the heel 6 of the ski boot 2 in abutment on, or however close to, the back of ski 3, when axis C is parallel to, or however substantially aligned with, the longitudinal ski axis L. Furthermore, the heelpiece 11 is positioned on the central segment of the downhill ski 3 or the like at a predetermined nominal distance from the clamping member 12 of the toepiece 10, so as to allow the projecting appendix 15 to reach and stably hook/lock the rear part of the shell 4, when the clamping member 12 of the toepiece 10 is tightened/closed on the projecting appendix 7 of shell 4 and allows the ski boot 2 to rotate on the toepiece 10 about axis A. The value of the distance between toepiece 10 and heelpiece 11 obviously depends on the dimensions/length of the shell 4, i.e. on the size of the ski boot 2. With reference to figures 4 and 5, in particular in the example shown, the turret 14 is preferably fixed onto the fastening plate 13 with the possibility of freely rotating about axis B, and the heelpiece 13 is preferably also provided with an elastic programmed-release locking member 16, which is structured so as to allow the rotation of turret 14 about axis B when the twisting torque exceeds a predetermined threshold value. In other words, the elastic locking member 16 is structured so as to elastically contrast any rotation of turret 14 about axis B, which would compromise the alignment between reference axis C of the hooking appendix 15 and the longitudinal ski axis L, such an alignment allowing the projecting appendix 15 to engage the rear part of shell 4 so as to stably retain the heel 6 of the ski boot 2 in abutment on, or however close to, the back of ski 3, thus preventing any rotation of the ski boot 2 about axis A. In the example shown, in particular, the upper turret 14 is partially inserted and locked in an axially rotational manner within a tubular cylindrical hub 16 which juts out from the upper face of the fastening plate 13, thus remaining locally coaxial to the rotation axis B of the turret 14. Instead, with reference to figure 5, the elastic locking member 16 is preferably, but not necessarily accommodated in the portion of turret 14 which is rotationally inserted into the hub 17, and comprises: a helical spring 18 or similar elastic element, which is inserted into a through hole 19 made in a diametrical position on the portion of the turret 14 which is rotationally inserted into the hub 17;a locking ball or pin 20, which is inserted in an axially sliding manner at a first end/mouth of the pass-through hole 19; and finallya threaded dowel 21 screwed at the second end/mouth of the through hole 19. The helical spring 18 is fitted in the through hole 19 so that one of its two ends abuts on the locking ball 20 and the other is on the threaded dowel 21, and is preloaded under compression by means of the threaded dowel 21, so as to push and strongly maintain the locking ball 20 abutting on the inner surface of the hub 17, within a stop seat or recess 20a appropriately obtained on the cylindrical tubular wall of hub 17. With reference to figures 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, the turret 14 is further divided into a fixed lower casing 14a, which is rigidly or axially rotationally fixed directly to the fastening plate 13, and into a tiltable upper casing 14b, which rests on the top of the lower casing 14a, and is hinged to the lower casing 14a on the opposite side with respect to the toepiece 10, so as to freely rotate about a reference axis D, which is locally substantially perpendicular to axes B and C, i.e. locally substantially perpendicular to axes B and C, i.e. is locally substantially perpendicular to the middle plane of turret 14. In particular, in the example shown, the lower part of the lower casing 14a is locked in an axially rotational manner within the tubular hub 17, so as to allow the whole turret 14 to rotate about axis B, and the elastic locking member 16 is structured so as to allow the rotation of the lower casing 14a about axis B when the twisting torque exceeds a predetermined threshold value. The hooking projecting appendix 15 of the heelpiece 11 juts out from the tiltable upper casing 14b while remaining locally substantially parallel to axis C, and the heelpiece 11 is further provided with a programmed-release locking member 22 which is preferably, but not necessarily, accommodates in the lower casing 14a of the turret, and is structured so as to lock and retain the tiltable upper casing 14b abutting on the lower casing 14a with reference axis C of the hooking projecting appendix 15 arranged locally substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis L of the ski. More in detail, the programmed-release locking member 22 is structured so as to lock and retain the tiltable upper casing 14b abutting on the lower casing 14a with reference axis C of the hooking projecting appendix 15 locally substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis L of the ski, until the tilting torque transmitted to the tiltable upper casing 14b exceeds a predetermined threshold value; and so as to completely release the tiltable upper casing 14b from the lower casing 14a when the tilting torque transmitted to the tiltable upper casing 14b exceeds the aforesaid threshold value, so as to allow the tiltable upper casing 14b to freely rotate backwards about the articulation axis of the hinge, i.e. about axis D. In particular, in the example shown, the top of the lower casing 14a preferably, but not necessarily, has a substantially parallelepiped shape and ends at the top with a flat surface which is locally substantially perpendicular to the rotation axis B of turret 14. The tiltable upper casing 14b is instead substantially shaped like an inverted L and rests on the lower casing 14a so that the upper horizontal segment of the casing rests directly on the upper flat surface of the lower casing 14a, and the lower vertical segment of the casing rests on the edge of the lower casing 14a, from the side opposite to the toepiece 10 and to the hooking projecting appendix 15. The hooking projecting appendix 15 juts out from the end of the upper horizontal segment of the tiltable upper casing 14b, while the lower end of the vertical segment of the tiltable casing 14b is hinged directly onto the side edge of the lower casing 14a, by means of a transversal through pin which extends coaxially to axis D. With reference to figures 4, 6 and 7, the locking member 22 is preferably arranged within a cavity 22a specifically made in the lower casing 14a, close to the side edge of turret 14 from where the hooking projecting appendix 15 juts out, and is structured so as to clamp and retain until the extraction force of the tooth exceeds a predetermined threshold value, a hooking tooth 23 which juts out from the tiltable upper casing 14b, and penetrates into the cavity 22a until the locking member 22 is reached. More in detail, in the example shown, the hooking tooth 23 juts out from the lower face of the tiltable casing 14b, thus remaining preferably locally substantially coplanar to the middle plane P of turret 14, and penetrates into the cavity 22a through a specific slot made on the top of the lower casing 14a to reach the locking member 22. The locking member 39 preferably comprises instead: two thrust bearing jaws 24, which are arranged within the cavity 22a which accommodates the locking member 22, on opposite sides of the middle plane P the turret where there is the hooking tooth 23;a manually-operated jaw adjusting mechanism 25, which is able to displace the two thrust bearing jaws 24 from and towards the middle plane of the turret, so as to adjust the distance existing between each thrust bearing jaw 41 and the middle plane P of turret 14;two locking balls 26, which are arranged in abutment against the side edges of the hooking tooth 23, on opposite sides thereof, so as to be aligned each to a respective thrust bearing jaw 24; and finallytwo helical springs 27 or similar elastic elements, each of which is interposed between a corresponding thrust bearing jaw 24 and the corresponding locking ball 26, so as to strongly push the locking ball 26 into abutment against the edge of the hooking tooth 23. The preload of the helical springs 27 is adjusted by varying, by means of the adjustment mechanism 25, the distance which separates the two thrust bearing jaw 24 from the middle plane of the turret 14, where the hooking tooth 23 lays. The hooking tooth 23 and the locking balls 26 are shaped/dimensioned so as to generate an elastic recalling force parallel to the tooth, which tends to pull the hooking tooth 23 into the lower casing 14a; and so as to prevent the hooking tooth 23 from being extracted our of the lower casing 14a until the extraction force is maintained under the predetermined limit value, which depends on the force with which the helical springs 27 squeeze the locking balls 26 against the hooking tooth 23. With reference to figure 7, in particular in the example shown, the jaw adjusting mechanism 25 consists of a transversal supporting shaft 25, which extends coaxially to a reference axis G locally substantially perpendicular to the middle plane P of turret 14 (i.e. locally substantially parallel to the rotation axis D of the tiltable upper casing 14b) and engages tiltable lower casing 14a of the head 14 in a pass-through and axially rotational manner, intersecting the cavity 22a which accommodates the locking member 22. The supporting shaft 42 has, on opposite sides of the middle plane P of turret 14, two threaded portions with specular thread, and the two thrust bearing jaws 24 are screwed each on a respective threaded portion of the shaft, so that the rotation of the supporting shaft 25 about axis G allows to simultaneously approach/space apart the two thrust bearing jaws 24 from the middle plane P of turret 14. With reference to figures 2, 3, 4 and 8, the hooking projecting appendix 15 of the heelpiece 11 is instead preferably fixed to the tiltable upper casing 14b of turret 14 with the possibility of moving with respect to the tiltable casing between: a completely extracted position (see figures 2, 4 and 8), in which the hooking projecting appendix 15 juts out from the tiltable upper casing 14a of turret 14 by a predetermined length 11 sufficient to completely engage the rear part of shell 4 so as to prevent any rotation of the ski boot 2 about axis A; anda retracted position (see figures 3 and 8), in which the hooking projecting appendix 15 is completely retracted within the tiltable upper casing 14b, or juts out from the body of the turret 14 by a length 12 which is shorter than length l1, so as not to reach and lock the rear part of shell 4. Additionally, the heelpiece 11 also comprises a manually-operated command device 28, which is structured so as to selectively and alternatively move and lock the hooking projecting appendix 15 either in the completely extracted position or in the retracted position. More in detail, the command device 28 can arranged the hooking projecting appendix 15 alternatively and as desired either in the completely extracted position or in the retracted position, by moving the projecting appendix 15 with respect to the tiltable upper casing 14b in a direction d locally parallel to reference axis C of the protruding appendix itself. With reference to figures 4, 5 and 6, in particular in the example shown, the heelpiece 11 comprises a latch element 29 which extends through the upper horizontal segment of the tiltable upper casing 14b thus remaining locally substantially coaxial, or however parallel, to the reference axis C of the projecting appendix 15, with the possibility of moving forwards and backwards with respect to the tiltable upper casing 14b parallel to axis C. The hooking projecting appendix 15 consists of the tip of the latch element 29, and the command device 28 is structured so as to move the latch element 29 forward and backward with respect to the tiltable upper casing 14b of turret 14 parallel to axis C, and then to stably lock the latch element 29 alternatively in an advanced position or in a retracted position. More in detail, the manually-operated command device 28 is structured so as to move and lock the latch element 29 to an advanced position (see figures 4 and 5), in which the tip 15 of the latch element 29 juts out from the body of the tiltable upper casing 14b by a predetermined length l1 sufficient to completely engage the rear part of the shell 4 so as to prevent any rotation of the ski boot 2 about axis A; or to a retracted position (see figure 7) in which the tip 15 of the latch element 29 is either completely retracted within the body of the tiltable upper casing 14b, or juts out from the casing itself by a length l2 which is considerably shorter than the length l1, so as not to reach and lock the rear part of shell 4. Obviously, the hooking projecting appendix 15 is in the completely extracted position when the latch element 29 is in the advanced position. With reference to figure 4, in particular in the example shown, the command device 28 preferably comprises: an antagonist elastic element 30, which is interposed between the latch element 29 and the body of the tiltable upper casing 14b, and is structured so as to bring and elastically maintain the latch element 29 in the advanced position (see figures 2, 4 and 6), which corresponds to arranging the hooking projecting appendix 15 in the completely extracted position; and a manually-operated moving member 31 which is interposed between the latch element 29 and the body of turret 14, and is structured so as to allow the user to move the latch element 29 from the advanced position to the retracted position, thus overcoming the elastic force of the antagonist elastic element 30. Additionally, the manually-operated moving member 31 is also structured so as to selectively lock the latch element 29 in the retracted position, thus overcoming the elastic force of the antagonist elastic element 30. With reference to figures 4, 5, 7 and 8, in particular in the example shown, the latch element 29 consists of a sliding shoe or carriage 32, which is inserted in an axially sliding manner into an elongated cavity 32a extending into the tiltable upper casing 14b, thus remaining locally coaxial to the reference axis C of the projecting appendix 15; of a pair of rectilinear stems or pins 33 preferably, but not necessarily, with circular section, extending by the side and parallel to axis C, on opposite sides of the middle plane of turret 14, so as to completely cross the sliding shoe or carriage 32 and jut out from both sides of the tiltable upper casing 14b of turret 14; and of a crosspiece 34, which is adapted to rigidly connect together the rear distal ends of the two pins 33, i.e. the ends which are on the opposite side with respect to tip 10. The two rectilinear pins 33 are rigidly fixed to the sliding shoe or carriage 32 so as to move parallel to axis C, along with the sliding shoe or carriage 32; while, the front distal ends of the two rectilinear pins 33, i.e. the distal ends which face the tip 10 of the ski mountaineer binding device 1, are shaped/structured so as to be engaged in the rear part of shell 4 in order to stably retain the heel 6 of the ski boot 2 in abutment on, or however close to, the back of ski 3. In other words, the front distal ends of the two rectilinear pins 33 can axially move from and to the tip 10 in order to couple and lock the rear part of the shell 4 hinged on the gripper-like clamping member 12 of the toepiece 10, thus forming the hooking projecting appendix 15 of the heelpiece 11. With reference to figures 4, 5 and 6, the elongated cavity 32a which is obtained within the tiltable upper casing 14b of turret 14, is obviously shaped/dimensioned so as to allow the sliding shoe or carriage 32 to move within the tiltable upper casing 14b parallel to axis C, between an advanced position (see figure 4), in which the distal ends 15 of the two rectilinear pins 33 jut out from the body of turret 14 by a predetermined length l1 sufficient to completely engage in the rear part of shell 4 so as to prevent any rotation of the ski boot 2 about the axis A; and a retracted position (see figure 8), in which the distal ends 15 of the two rectilinear pins 33 are either completely retracted within the body of turret 14, or jut out from the body of turret 14 by a length l2 which is much shorter than the length l1, so as not to reach the rear part of shell 4. Again with reference figures 4, 5 and 8, the antagonist elastic element 30 instead preferably, but not necessarily, consists of a helical spring 30 or similar elastic member, extending into the elongated cavity 32a locally substantially coaxial to axis C, so as to be arranged between the two rectilinear pins 33, and one of its two axial ends is stably in abutment on a body of the sliding shoe 26 and the other is on the body of the tiltable upper casing 14b. The helical spring 30 is additionally preloaded under compression so as to strongly push and maintain the sliding shoe or carriage 32 in abutment on the end of the elongated cavity 32a facing the toepiece 10, so as to make the distal ends 15 of the two rectilinear pins 33 protrude and maintain them either in the advanced or in the completely retracted position. With reference to the accompanying figures, the manually-operated moving member 31 which allows the user to move the latch element 29 forwards and backwards thus overcoming the force of the helical spring 30, comprises instead: a command lever 35 which is hooked onto the rear part of the latch element 29, and has its lower end hinged on the side edge of the lower casing 14a of turret 14, on the opposite side with respect to said hooking projecting appendix 15, so as to freely oscillate on a reference plane locally substantially parallel to, and preferably also coinciding with the middle plane P of the turret 14; anda locking device 36 which is interposed between the lower casing 14a of turret 14 and the command lever 35, capable of immobilizing/locking in a rigid and stable, although easily releasable manner the command lever 35 in an intermediate unlocking position (see figures 3 and 8), in which the command lever 35 is tilted with respect to the vertical by a predetermined angle, so as to arrange and maintain the latch element 29 in the retracted position, thus overcoming the force of the helical spring 30. In particular, in the example shown, the lower end of the command lever 35 is hinged to the side edge of the lower casing 14a of turret 14, on the opposite side with respect to the hooking projecting appendix 15, so as to rotate about a transversal reference axis, which is locally substantially horizontal to axes B and C, and further preferably, but not necessarily, even coinciding with the rotation axis D of the tiltable upper casing 14b of turret 14. The locking device 36 is instead structured so as to allow the command lever 35 to oscillate about the transversal axis D to be alternatively arranged in a locking position (see figures 2 and 4) in which the command lever 35 is arranged in a substantially vertical position, so as to allow the antagonist elastic element 30 to arrange the latch element 29 in the advanced position; in an unlocking position (see figures 3 and 8) in which the command lever 35 is tilted by a predetermined angle with respect to the vertical, so as to arrange and maintain the latch element 29 in the retracted position, thus overcoming the force of the helical spring 30; and finally in a switching position, in which the command lever 35 is tilted by a predetermined angle with respect to the vertical, which is larger than that taken in the unlocking position. The locking device 36 is further structured so as to allow the command lever 35 to move/pass from the unlocking position to the locking position, exclusively after the command lever 35 has been temporarily positioned in the switching position. In particular, in the example shown, the command lever 35 engages in a pass-through manner the recess delimited by the two rectilinear pins 33 and by the stiffening crosspiece 34 of the latch element 29, so as to rest and freely slide on the stiffening crosspiece 34 of the latch element 29. When the tiltable upper casing 14b tilts backwards while rotating about axis D, the crosspiece 34 of the latch element 29 moves away from the command lever 36, whereby the manually-operated moving member 31 does not obstruct/prevent the free tilting movement of the tiltable upper casing 14b. With reference to figure 4, the locking device 36 comprises instead a rigid longitudinal stem or strut 37, which has a first end hinged in a freely rotational and sliding manner within a transversal guide slot 35a made on the body of the command lever 35, and a second end inserted in an axially sliding manner into the lower casing 14a of turret 14, immediately underneath the tiltable upper casing 14b and the latch element 29; and a flip-flop snap locking mechanism 38 which is accommodated within the lower casing 14a, immediately under the tiltable upper casing 14b and the latch element 29, and is structured so as to selectively prevent the second end of the longitudinal strut 37 from penetrating into the lower casing 14a beyond a predetermined limit which corresponds to arranging the command lever 33 in the above-mentioned unlocking position. More in detail, the snap locking mechanism 38 is structured so as to allow the longitudinal strut 37 to slide into the lower casing 14a between an advanced position, which corresponds to the command lever 35 arranged in the locking position, and a retracted position, which corresponds to the command lever 35 arranged in the switching position. Additionally, the snap locking mechanism 38 is structured so as to selectively stop/lock the stroke of the strut 37 towards the advanced position, when the strut 37 is in an intermediate position between an advanced position and a retracted position. The command lever 35 is in the unlocking position when the strut 37 is in the intermediate position and the snap locking mechanism 38 is finally structured so as to be arranged in/switch to the configuration which leaves strut 37 free to complete the stroke towards the advanced position, when the longitudinal strut 37 is temporarily taken to the retracted position. With reference to figures 4, 5, 8 and 9, in particular in the example shown, the portion of strut 37, which is slidingly inserted into the lower casing 14a of turret 14, extends along a reference axis E which is locally substantially coplanar and preferably also substantially parallel to axis C of the latch element 29. Furthermore, the longitudinal strut 37 preferably, but not necessarily, consists of a fork element 37 which has a central trunk hinged directly onto the command lever 35 by means of a transversal pin which may freely slide within the guide slot 35a made on the body of the command lever 35, and has the two arms or tines 37a which extend in an axially sliding manner into turret 14, where the snap locking mechanism 38 is accommodated. With particular reference to figure 8, the snap locking mechanism 38 preferably comprises instead a pivoting rocker arm 39 which is fixed within the lower casing 14a of turret 14, next to the second end of the rigid strut 37, with the possibility of freely oscillating while remaining on a laying plane locally and substantially coplanar or however parallel to the longitudinal axis E of the strut 37; and an elastic member 40, here a scissor-like spring, which is interposed between the pivoting rocker arm 39 and the lower casing 14a of turret 14, and is structured so as to elastically maintain the rigid strut 37, either selectively or alternatively, in two different operating positions. In the first operating position, the pivoting rocker arm 39 is close to the longitudinal strut 37, and can hook the strut 37 thus preventing it from completing the movement from the intermediate position to the advanced position, i.e. from further penetrating into the body of the lower casing 14a of turret 14. In the second operating position, the pivoting rocker arm 39 is instead away from the longitudinal strut 37, and allows the longitudinal strut 37 to freely move with respect to the lower casing 14a of turret 14, parallel to axis E and towards the advanced position. In the example shown, the pivoting rocker arm 39 is preferably hinged onto the lower casing 14a so as to freely oscillate about a transversal rotation axis F which is locally substantially orthogonal to reference axis E of the rigid strut 37, while remaining on a laying plane locally substantially coplanar or however parallel to axes B and E, and preferably also substantially coinciding with the middle plane P of turret 14. The pivoting rocker arm 39 is structured/ shaped so as to automatically cause the movement of the rocker arm from the second to the first operating position, when the longitudinal strut 37 reaches the advanced position under the force of the elastic element 24; and so as to automatically cause the movement of the rocker arm from the first to the second operating position, when the longitudinal strut 37 reaches the retracted position being pulled by the command lever 35. More in detail and with particular reference to figure 5 and 9, in the example shown, the pivoting rocker arm 39 is preferably placed between the two arms or tines 37a of the strut 37, and is provided with a detent 39a which projects towards the strut 37 immediately above, at a predetermined distance from the rotation axis F, and is dimensioned so as to hook a transversal pin 37b which rigidly connects together the arms or tines 37a of the strut 37, when the pivoting rocker arm 39 is in the first operating position. At a greater distance from the rotation axis F with respect to the detent 39a, the pivoting rocker arm 39 further has a first switching crest 39b with a cam profile which extends towards the strut 37 so as to intersect the trajectory of the transversal pin 37b of strut 37 when the rigid strut 37 moves from the intermediate position to the retracted position. The switching crest 39b is shaped so as to oblige the pivoting rocker arm 39 to rotate about axis F against the force of the elastic element 40, to pass beyond the unstable balance point which forces/obliges the elastic element 40 to move the pivoting rocker arm 39 to the second operating position. On the opposite side with respect to the detent 39a and the switching crest 39b, the pivoting rocker arm 39 finally has a second switching crest 39c with a cam profile which extends towards the strut 37 so as to intersect the trajectory of the transversal pin 37b of strut 37 when the rigid strut 37 reaches the advanced position. The switching crest 39c is shaped so as to oblige the pivoting rocker arm 39 to rotate about axis F against the force of the elastic element 40, to pass beyond the unstable balance point which forces/obliges the elastic element 40 to move the pivoting rocker arm 39 back to the first operating position. With reference to the appended claims, the heelpiece 11 is finally provided with a heel rising member 41 which is fixed on the top of the tiltable upper casing 14b of turret 14 with the possibly of moving on the upper casing to and from a working position, in which the heel rising member 41 juts beyond the side edge of the turret 14 to directly support the heel 6 of the ski boot 2 in a raised position; and with a mechanical member 42, which connects the heel rising member 41 to the latch element 29 underneath and is structured so as to transmit the translation motion to the heel rising member 41, so as to move the heel rising member 41 on the top of the tiltable upper casing 14b substantially along with the latch element 29. More in detail, the heel rising member 41 is fixed onto the top of the tiltable upper casing 14b with the possibility of sliding forwards and backwards on the turret 14 in a direction d locally substantially parallel to the reference axis C of the hooking projecting appendix 15, between a retracted or resting position (see figure 8), in which the heel rising member 41 is substantially aligned over turret 14, and is further preferably confined within the perimeter of the tiltable upper casing 14b of turret 14; and an advanced or working position (see figures 4 and 6), in which the heel rising member 41 juts out beyond the side edge of the tiltable upper casing 14b, immediately over the hooking projecting appendix 15, so as to substantially cover as a roof the entire hooking projecting appendix 15 arranged in the completely extracted position, thus stably supporting/maintaining the heel 6 of the ski boot 2 in a raised/lifted position with respect to the back of ski 2. In other words, when the heel rising member 41 is in the advanced or working position (see dashed line in figure 4), it juts out beyond the side of the turret 14 by a length l3 such as to exceed/pass beyond the distal ends 15 of the two rectilinear pins 33 which, in turn, jut out from the body of the tiltable upper casing 14b by a length l1 sufficient to completely engage the rear part of the shell 4 hinged onto the toepiece 10. The mechanical member 42 is instead structured so as to move the heel rising member 41 to the retracted or resting position when the latch element 29 moves to the retracted position to arrange the distal ends 15 of the two rectilinear pins 33, i.e. the hooking projecting appendix 15, in the retracted position; and to move the heel rising member 41 to the advanced or working position when the latch element 29 moves to the advanced position to arrange the distal ends 15 of the two rectilinear pins 33 in the completely retracted position. More in detail, in the example shown, the mechanical member 42 is preferably structured so as to rigidly restrain the heel rising member 41 to the latch element 29, when the latch element 29 moves from the advanced position to the retracted position; and to elastically restrain the heel rising member 41 to the latch element 29, when the latch element 29 moves from the retracted position to the advanced position. With particular reference to figures 2, 3 and 4, in particular in the example shown, the heel rising member 41 comprises a main supporting plate 43, which rests on the top of turret 14, and is slidingly fixed to the body of turret 14 so as to slide forwards and backwards on the top of turret 14 in a direction da locally substantially parallel to the reference axis C of the hooking projecting appendix 15; and preferably also an auxiliary supporting block 44, which rests on the upper face of the main supporting plate 43, and is slidingly fixed onto the body of the supporting plate 43, so as to slide forwards and backwards on the top of the supporting plate 43 in a direction db preferably locally substantially parallel to the reference axis C of the hooking projecting appendix 15. Both the supporting plate 43 and the auxiliary supporting block 44 are structured to support the heel 6 of ski boot 2. The mechanical member 42, instead, is structured so as to connect the main supporting plate 43 of the heel rising member 41 to the latch element 29 immediately underneath, so as to move the supporting plate 43 between a retracted or resting position (see figure 8) in which the supporting plate 43 is substantially confined within the perimeter of the top of the tiltable upper casing 14b of turret 14; and an advanced or working position (see dashed line in figure 4) in which the main supporting plate 43 juts out beyond the side edge of the tiltable upper casing 14b, immediately over the hooking projecting appendix 15, so as to substantially cover as a roof the whole hooking projecting appendix 15 arranged in the completely extracted position. In particular, in the example shown, the mechanical member 42 comprises a flexible tongue 42 made of an elastically deformable material, which is substantially C-folded, and is rigidly fixed on the sliding shoe or carriage 32 of the latch element 29, so as to jut out from the top of the tiltable upper casing 14b of turret 14 through a longitudinal through slot which extends parallel to the reference axis C of the latch element 29. The upper side of the flexible tongue 42 is adapted to rest and slide on the body of the main supporting plate 43 of the heel rising member 41, on a bottom of a longitudinal groove 42a which extends on the lower face of the supporting plate 43 parallel to the reference axis C. The bottom of the longitudinal groove 42a is further inclined by a few degrees towards the tip 15 of the latch element 29, i.e. towards the distal ends 15 of the rectilinear pins 33, so as to transform the upward elastic force exerted by the flexible tongue 42, into a horizontal elastic force f which tends to push the supporting plate 43 to the advanced or working position (see figure 4) with an increasing intensity as a function of the misalignment between the position of the supporting plate 43 and that of the sliding shoe or carriage 32 of the latch element 29. The operation of the ski mountaineering binding device 1 can be easily inferred from the above description and no further explanations are thus required, except to explain that by moving the latch element 29 forwards and backwards, i.e. hooking projecting appendix 15 of the heelpiece 11, the rear part of shell 4 can be rapidly hooked to/unlocked from the heelpiece 11 without needing to unlock the front part of shell 4 from the toepiece 10. There are many advantages deriving from the particular structure of the heelpiece 11. By virtue of the two-part structure of turret 14, indeed, the automatic unlocking of the rear part of shell 4 occurs in a timely manner also when, in case of falls, the vertical vector component of the pulse-like mechanical stresses has a relatively small value, i.e. when the pulse-like mechanical stresses are directed so as to be nearly tangent to the back of the ski. Obviously, this increased sensitivity to tangential mechanical stress significantly increases the overall safety of the ski mountaineering binding device 1 as compared to those currently known. Furthermore, the intervention threshold of the locking member 22 may be very easily and rapidly adjusted by operating directly on the preload adjustment mechanism 25 of the helical springs 27. It is finally apparent that changes and variants can be made to the above-described ski mountaineering binding device 1 without departing from the scope of protection of the present invention. For example, the latch element 29 may be provided with a single pin with juts out from the body of the tiltable upper casing 15b of turret 14, being coaxial to axis C, and has a distal end shaped so as to engage the rear part of shell 4 roughly at the heel. Therefore, in this variant, the hooking projecting appendix 15 of the heelpiece 11 consists of this joined projecting pin.
