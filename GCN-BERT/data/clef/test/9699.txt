Field of the Invention The invention relates to compositions containing improved tackifiers, as well as methods making and using the same. Background of the Invention In rubber technology, particular importance is attached to the assembly of unvulcanized blanks from prefabricated semi-finished products. The adhesion of the semi-finished product determines the cohesion and, above all, the dimensional stability of the "unvulcanized blank". The desired dimensional stability of the material is not guaranteed if the tackiness of the superimposed layers is insufficient. Air pockets are likely to form, on the other hand, if the layers adhere too tightly to one another- when the blank is assembled-resulting in poor fusion of the layers in the vulcanization process. The defects due to deficient autohesion are often not recognized until after vulcanization, and in some cases not until the finished product is in use, with all the economic disadvantages that then entails, like economic loss. There is little understanding of the workings of the methods applied by those involved in production processes to improve the tackiness of compounds. These methods, which are based for the most part on empirical experience, treat the surface by covering the compound slabs with interleaving film of fabric materials and use resins as so-called tackifier in compounds. A particular use, among many, of such rubber compositions is for the creation of tires, such as those used in transportation, preferably automobiles. Among the many desirable attributes for tire tread compositions, a great resistance to abrasion is preferred. That is, rubber compositions that easily break down under frictional forces is not desirable because such compositions when used in a tire easily wear resulting in a short life. In addition, it is preferable that tires have very good web and/or dry grip. While dry grip is usually maintained by many rubber compositions, wet grip is not. Rubber compositions having good wet grip, thus improved wet skid resistance, is highly desirable for use in tires. Finally, it is highly desired to create a tire that helps increase the fuel economy in the transportation industry, for example in the automobile industry. One manner in which to increase fuel efficiency into a tire is to create the tire from a rubber composition that "likes" to roll. A rubber composition that "likes" to roll, in other words, has a reduced tendency to resist rolling. If a rubber composition has a reduced tendency to resist rolling, less energy is required to roll the tire. For example, less energy would be required out of the engine of an automobile if the automobile included tires made from, at least in part, rubber compositions that had a reduced tendency to resist rolling. While rubber compositions capable of being useful in tires and/or tire tread compositions are known, no such rubber composition having maximized abrasion resistance, maximized wet grip (e.g. wet skid resistance), and minimized resistance to rolling (e.g. maximizing fuel economy) is known to date.

The composition may contain the filler at any amount. The composition contains from 5 to 250 phr, preferably from 10 to 150 phr, more preferably from 40 to 120 phr, most preferably from 60 to 120 phr of the inorganic filler. The composition may contain 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 210, 220, 230, 240 and 250 phr, including any and all ranges and subranges therein. In the present invention, the filler, such as those exemplified above, may be used singly or in combination of two or more. The composition of the present invention may contain a coupler or coupling agent. In many cases there tends to be a lack of, or at least an insufficient degree of, physical and/or chemical bonding and/or interaction between the filler and the rubber polymer or copolymer mentioned above so as to enable the filler to become a reinforcing filler for the rubber polymer and/or copolymer. While various solutions, treatments and procedures have been devised to overcome such deficiencies, compounds capable of enhancing the degree of physical and/or chemical bonding and/or interaction between the filler and the rubber polymer or copolymer are generally known as coupling agents, or couplers. Examples of couplers include any coupler that is generally known in the art to the skilled artisan to enhance the degree of physical and/or chemical bonding and/or interaction between the filler and the rubber polymer or copolymer. In the case of a when silica is used as a filler, such coupling agents may generally be composed of a silane which has a constituent component, or moiety, (the silane portion) capable of reacting with the silica surface and, also, a constituent component, or moiety, capable of interacting with the rubber, particularly a sulfur vulcanizable rubber which contains carbon-to-carbon double bonds, or unsaturation. In this manner, then the coupler may act as a connecting bridge between the silica and the rubber and thereby enhances the rubber reinforcement aspect of the silica. This ideal can be used by the skilled artisan so as to be applied to any filler although the specific chemical groups and chemistry may change according to the selection of the filler. In one aspect, the silane of the coupling agent apparently forms a bond to the silica surface, possibly through interaction with silanol groups on the silica surface, and the rubber interactive component of the coupling agent apparently interacts with the rubber. Usually the rubber interactive component of the coupler is temperature sensitive and may tend to combine with the rubber during the higher temperature sulfur vulcanization of the rubber composition and after the silane group of the coupler has reacted with the silica. However, partly because of typical temperature sensitivity of the coupler, some degree of interaction may occur between the rubber-interaction component of the coupler and the rubber during initial rubber/silica/coupler mixing stage(s) and, thus, prior to the subsequent vulcanization of the rubber composition. The rubber-interactive reactive group component of the coupler may be, for example, one or more of groups such as mercapto, amino, vinyl, epoxy, and sulfur groups, preferably a sulfur or mercapto moiety and more preferably sulfur. Numerous coupling agents may be used to combine silica and rubber polymer or copolymer, such as, for example, silane coupling agents containing a polysulfide component, or structure such as, for example, bis-(trialkoxysilyalkyl) organosilane polysulfides containing from 2 to about 8 sulfur atoms in a polysulfide bridge such as, for example, bis-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide, trisulfide or disulfide. In the case of the disulfide, if in a high purity form, some free sulfur, or sulfur donor, may desirably be added with the coupler in a rubber mixing step to enhance an overall effect of interaction with the elastomer, or rubber. The composition of the present invention may also contain other synthetic rubbers, and may further contain various chemicals conventionally used in the rubber industry such as process oils, antioxidants, vulcanizing agents, vulcanization auxiliary agents, vulcanization accelerators and scorch inhibitors. The composition of the present invention may also contain at least one antioxidant. Representative antioxidants may be, for example, diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine and others, such as, for example, those disclosed in the Vanderbilt Rubber Handbook (1978), pages 344-346. The composition of the present invention may also contain a wax, preferably a paraffinic wax. The composition of the present invention may also contain a fatty acid. An example of a fatty acid is a stearic acid.

The composition of the present invention has preferably and/or improved vulcanization when containing the above-mentioned tackifier as compared to those compositions that do not contain the resin of the present invention and/or that of those compositions containing Koresin. When the composition of the present invention has or improved vulcanization as measure by tanδ described below and in the attached report, the improvement is at least 5% that of those compositions that do not contain the resin of the present invention and/or that of those compositions containing Koresin The presence of the resin with a rubber polymer and/or copolymer in the composition of the present invention is considered herein to be beneficial because of observed viscoelastic properties of the composition such as complex and storage modulus, loss modulus tanδ and loss compliance at different temperature/frequency/strain as hereinafter generally described. The properties of complex and storage modulus, loss modulus, tanδ and loss compliance are understood to be generally well known to those having skill in such art. They are hereinafter generally described. The viscoelastic properties of the present invention when used for a compounded rubber blend, such as for a tire tread application, are considered herein as being important. For example, a tanδ property is the ratio of the viscous contribution to the elastic contribution for a viscoelastic rubber subjected to a dynamic deformation. Such properties are typically represented in a form of a curve(s) as a plot of tanδ values versus temperature. For a tire with good wet skid resistance, a tread rubber with a tanδ maximization (a maximization of a tanδ value of a tanδ vs temperature curve) is desired in a temperature range, or region, of about -45°C. to about +10°C. Also, for a tire to have good wet grip, wet skid resistance, it is desired that the composition have a high tanδ between the temperatures of from about 0 to about 30°C. Further, for a tire to have low resistance to rolling and thus provide better gas mileage as discussed above, it is desired that the composition have a low tanδ between the temperatures of from about 60 to about 80 °C. The composition of the present invention has any tanδ from about 60 to about 80°C. The tanδ from about 60 to about 80°C is less than 0.1400, preferably less than 0.13, more preferably less than about 0.12 and most preferably less than 0.11. For example, at any temperature from about 60 to about 80°C (including about 60, 65, 70, 75, and 80°C), it is preferable that the tanδ of the composition be less than 0.1400, preferably less than 0.13, more preferably less than about 0.12 and most preferably less than 0.11. In a preferred embodiment, the composition contains a terpene phenol resin and has a tanδ at about 60°C of about 0.139 or less, preferably about 0.135 or less, more preferably about 0.128 or less, most preferably about 0.112 or less. In another preferred embodiment, the composition contains a terpene phenol resin and has a tanδ at about 70°C of about 0.129 or less, preferably about 0.125 or less, more preferably about 0.120 or less, most preferably about 0.115 or less. The composition of the present invention has any tanδ from about 0 to about 30°C. The tanδ from about 0 to about 30°C is greater than about 0.16, preferably greater than about 0.165, more preferably greater than about 0.17 and most preferably greater than about 0.175. For example, at any temperature from about 0 to about 30°C (including about 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30°C), it is preferable that the tanδ of the composition be greater than 0.1600, preferably greater than 0.165, more preferably less than about 0.17 and most preferably greater than 0.175. In a preferred embodiment, the composition contains a terpene phenol resin and has a tanδ at about 0°C of about 0.205 or more, preferably about 0.21 or more, more preferably about 0.22 or more, most preferably about 0.23 or more. In another preferred embodiment, the composition contains a terpene phenol resin and has a tanδ at about 20°C of about 0.166 or more, preferably about 0.169 or more, more preferably about 0.171 or more, most preferably about 0.174 or more. The composition of the present invention may have a reduced or increased tanδ at 70°C as compared to a composition not containing any resin according to the present invention and/or to a composition containing Koresin in the place of the resin according to the present invention. However, it is preferable that the composition of the present invention has a tanδ at 70°C that is at least 3%, preferably at least 4%, more preferably at least 5%, most preferably at least 10% less than the tanδ at 70°C of a composition not containing any resin according to the present invention and/or to a composition containing Koresin in the place of the resin according to the present invention. The composition of the present invention may have a reduced or increased tanδ at 20°C as compared to a composition not containing any resin according to the present invention and/or to a composition containing Koresin in the place of the resin according to the present invention. However, it is preferable that the composition of the present invention has a tanδ at 20°C that is at least 2%, preferably at least 7%, more preferably at least 10%, most preferably at least 15% greater than the tanδ at 20°C of a composition not containing any resin according to the present invention and/or to a composition containing Koresin in the place of the resin according to the present invention. The composition of the present invention may contain an effective amount of the resin. An effective amount means, for the purposes of herein, an amount of resin that is capable of allowing the composition to obtain any of the above-mentioned preferable performance and physical characteristics. More preferably, an effective amount of resin in the composition allows the composition to attain the above-mentioned abrasion resistance and tanδ values. Further, a composition containing the effective amount of resin, when incorporated into a tire according to the present invention, bestows upon the tire an increased abrasion resistance, an decreased resistance to rolling, and an increased wet skid resistance or wet grip. The term "phr" where used herein, and according to conventional practice, refers to parts of a respective material per 100 parts by weight of rubber, or elastomer. The presence of the tackifier mentioned above with a rubber blend is considered herein to be beneficial because of observed viscoelastic properties of the tread rubber composition such as complex and storage modulus, loss modulus tan.delta and loss compliance at different temperature/frequency/strain as hereinafter generally described. The properties of complex and storage modulus, loss modulus, tan.delta and loss compliance are understood to be generally well known to those having skill in such art. They are hereinafter generally described. The present invention is explained in more detail with the aid of the following embodiment examples. EXAMPLES Example 1 Synthesis of TP 115, a Terpene-Phenol Resin for Tire Tread Formulation Testing having 115°C Softening Point I. Raw Materials Alpha pinene, phenol, boron trifluoride, xylene, water, sodium carbonate, and sodium hypophosphite. II. Procedure II-A. Dehydration of Solvent and Phenol: (i) Charge 191 g of xylene to a 1.0 Liter Morton flask equipped with an agitator, a Dean-Stark trap attached to a condenser, and a thermocouple probe assembly with an inlet for nitrogen. (ii) Add 52.5 g of phenol to the xylene (iii) Fill up the DS trap with xylene. (iv) Place an electric heating mantle under the Morton flask. Begin heating and bring contents to reflux. (v) When refluxing begins, any water being removed from the solution will begin collecting at the bottom in the Dean-Stark trap. Allow contents to reflux for 2 hours. II-B. Polymerization: (i) Cool the contents to ambient temperature and charge 1.4-1.5 g of boron trifluoride gas. (ii) The gas will form a complex with phenol and the solution will acquire a red-brown color. (iii) Once the gas has been charged, resume a gentle flow of nitrogen through the flask and gradually begin to warm contents to 67°C. (iv) At 67°C, begin adding drop-wise 197.5 g of alpha pinene. (v) As the reaction initiates, the temperature in the flask with rise; allow it to rise to 70°C and then maintain the entire polymerization process at 70-72°C. (vi) Feed the alpha pinene over a period of 2.5 to 3 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere, with agitation, and at 70-72°C. II-C. Neutralization of Catalyst: (i) Quench the reaction by adding an aqueous solution of sodium carbonate (1.5 g) and sodium hypophosphite (0.5 g) in 100mL of water. (ii) Heat contents to 75-80°C and agitate for 10 minutes. (iii) Allow layers to separate and draw off the aqueous layer. (iv) Add 100 mL of water to the reaction flask again and wash the mixture; repeat steps (ii) and (iii) above. II-D. Distillation and Stripping to Softening point: Transfer the resin solution to a tared 4-neck round bottom flask. Equip the flask with an agitator, a condenser via a 3-way take-off adapter, a thermocouple assembly, and a sparge tube for nitrogen sparging. Insert the sparge tube below the surface of the solution and beging nitrogen sparge (∼ 2000 cc/min.) Begin agitation and start heating using an electric heating mantle. Distill off the solvent between 140 and 170°C, and continue heating to 245°C. When the contents reach 245°C, terminate the sparge and maintain a nitrogen purge. Lower heating mantle and draw out a sample (1-2 mL) of the hot resin for softening point. Obtain a softening point (base s.p.) and resume heating and nitrogen sparge. Continue sparging at 245°C to strip out residual terpene-phenol dimers (residual in the TP resin), and sample as needed for s.p. measurements till target s.p. (112-118°C) is reached. At target s.p., lower mantle, discontinue nitrogen sparge and pour sample out for color, final softening point, and obtain a final resin yield. A typical synthesis affords a resin with a softening point of 115°C, a neat color of 6-7 Gardner at an overall yield of 85-90% Example 2 The following Commercial Products: Koresin (from BASF); Sylvalite RE 104 (from Arizona Chemical Company); SLYVARES TR5147 (from Arizona Chemical Company); SLYVARES TP 105 (from Arizona Chemical Company); and SLYVARES 525 (from Arizona Chemical Company), were tested according the DIN standard listed in the table below (DIN Nos: 53505, 53504, 53507), all of which are hereby incorporated, in their entirety, herein by reference, to test the physical properties thereof (see Table 1 below) when formulated in a rubber composition according to attached report. The tan d (e.g. tanδ) analysis is described in the report attached hereto. The difference between the vulcanization presented below and the vulcanization in the attached report is that the vulcanization was performed under conditions where the 2 mm thick fims have been cured for 17 minutes at 160°C in a hot platen press.

The tan d (or tanδ) reported above comes from the curve in Figure 1 which is a graph of these rubber formulations tan delta as a function of temperature when containing the above-mentioned tackifiers. Example 3 Various Terpene Phenol resins have been compared below in a silica tread rubber compound by mechanical and visco-elastic data. When applied in quantities of 4 parts resin on 100 part rubber, the Mooney viscosity, the vulcanization behaviour and most of the mechanical do not change significantly. There are significant differences in the visco-elastic behaviour. TP115 shows the best modification of the rubber compound in increasing damping for braking and reducing damping for rolling resistance. While TP95 increases damping in both relevant temperature zones, TP resins with high OH value such as TP300 and TP2040 HME exhibit higher rolling resistance without improving wet braking whereas TP2019 does not show any effect. Average SP of around 105 to 115 with low OH value seems to be an optimum in regard to dynamic tyre properties while high polarity is detrimental especially combined with high softening point. In addition, the compound containing TP2040HME shows significantly better abrasion resistance than the other resins and the reference. Surprisingly it was found that a lower softening point Terpene Phenol resin (Sylvares TP105) was performing similar to an AMS type resin. Terpene phenol resins are known in the industry as tackifier resins, however with much less tackification effect than Alkylphenol Novolaks and are applied in various compounds for sidewall, innerliners, or Apex. They are not known as compound modification resin like aliphatic, naphthenic or aromatic (modified) Hydrocarbon resins from fossil or renewable resources. In order to verify the effect, a series of terpene phenol resins have been selected and subjected to a comparative study in which a typical silica tread compound was used as matrix and the mechanical data and the visco-elastic data were generated. The resin selection criteria were softening point and polarity expressed by their OH value (See Table.2) Table 2. Softening point (SP) and OH value of various resins used in to make the rubber compositions.

In Figures 2 and 3, Terpene phenol with approximately the same softening point, but different OH values are compared. As can be clearly seen, TP95 shifts the tan δ upwards in both most interesting temperature ranges, i.e. 0 to + 30 and 60 to 80 °C., without changing the tan δ peak itself either in the height and its temperature position. The higher damping in the 0 to +20 °C temperature represents better wet braking capability, however the increased damping at the 60 to 80 °C temperature range relates to higher rolling resistance which is highly negative. On the contrary, TP115 generates an ideal change of the tan δ curve, higher the wet braking zone and lower in the rolling resistance zone. Also, the peak shift to slightly temperatures is also of interest. The peak height is related to abrasion and wear resistance. All tan δ curves have approx. the same peak height, there should be no difference in abrasion resistance which is confirmed by the DIN abrasion data. The compound containing TP105 has been excluded for reasons explained earlier. The other example of TP105 shown is only added for reference. The data were acquired by earlier work (DIK05A0386) in which another Butadien rubber (Buna CB 10) was used which is now not anymore available. Therefore the curves cannot be directly compared. For better clarity the relevant values of tan δ are tabulated in Table 5 which are represented in Figures 2 and 3. Table 5 tan δ values at selected temperatures of silica tread compounds containing 4php resin, for comparison data from the resin SA85 which is already commercialized for this application containing compound is included.Temp (°C)ReferenceTP 95TP105TP115TP300TP2019TP2040HMESA8500.21300.23460.23680.24210.21190.22140.20840.2388200.16570.18990.19730.17770.17470.17500.17300.1980500.12630.14490.15120.12490.13850.12840.13670.1498600.11770.13540.13820.11490.13090.11800.12710.1351700.11110.12880.12840.10510.12500.11120.12310.1257 As used throughout, ranges are used as a short hand for describing each and every value that is within the range, including all subranges therein.
