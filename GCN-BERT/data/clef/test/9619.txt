Example 24 : Preparation of 2'-amino-6-(2-amino-6-methylpyrimidin-4-yl)-3'-fluoro-[2,4'-bipyridin]-5-ol (LXXI)
Example 24-1 : Preparation of 6-(2-amino-6-methylpyrimidin-4-yl)-3'-fluoro-5-methoxy-[2,4'-bipyridin]-2'-amine (LXX)
4-(6-Bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-6-methylpyrimidin-2-amine (2.34 g, 7.93 mmol) obtained in Preparation Example 3 and 2-[3-fluoro-4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolan-2-yl)-2-pyridinyl]-imidodicarbonic acid-1,3-bis(1,1-dimethylethyl)ester obtained in Preparation Example 1 (5.21 g, 11.89 mmol) were dissolved in dioxane/distilled water (6 ml / 4 ml) solution. To the resulting solution were added potassium phosphate (5.48 g, 23.78 mmol) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (Pd(PPh3)4) (458 mg, 0.4 mmol) and the reaction solution was stirred with reflux for 24 hrs, cooled to room temperature, and filtered with celite. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (dimethylchloride/methanol = 9/1) to give the title compound (1.94 g, 75 %).
