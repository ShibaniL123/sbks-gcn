Example 11. (R)-N-methyl-N-(1-(propylsulfonyl)pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine
60.0 mg of (R)-N-methyl-N-(pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was added to a 5-mL round-bottomed flask and then dissolved with 0.600 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). After 0.0320 mL of 1-propanesulfonyl chloride was added thereto, the reaction mixture was treated with 0.0720 mL of N,N-diisopropylethylamine, and then stirred at room temperature for about 5 hours. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, and then the resulting residue was purified by flash column chromatography (MeOH:CH2Cl2=2:98). The resulting fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and then further under vacuum. As a result, 49.0 mg of (R)-N-methyl-N-(1-(propylsulfonyl)pyrrolidine-3-yl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine was obtained with a yield of about 54.9%.
