Step 2: 3-chloro-N-(3,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-4-fluoroaniline
To 1,2-dichloroethane (30 mL) were added 3-chloro-4-fluoroaniline (2.9 g, 20 mmol) and 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (3.3 g, 20 mmol), and stirred at room temperature for 1 hour. Then, sodium triacetoxyborohydride (10 g, 50 mmol) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture was poured into 100 mL of water, and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase was separated, washed with saturated brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo to afford the title compound (5.5 g, 93%).
