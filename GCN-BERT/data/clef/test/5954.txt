STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT Not applicable. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The field of the invention is desks or tables and more specifically desk or table assemblies that include leg members, work surfaces, storage components and wire management components that can be configured and assembled to form one or a plurality of different workstation arrangements using a small number or no tools. The office furniture industry is always evolving to meet the needs of customers. Benching systems have been developed that can be used in large open spaces to provide either temporary or permanent workstations for one or more employees. To this end, known benching systems typically include a leg structure that supports one or more desk or table top surfaces for use by one or more employees. In many cases, additional top members and leg structures can be added to an initial configuration to add additional employee workstations. Known designs often include some type of wire management system mounted to the undersurfaces of the top members for hiding power and/or data cables needed to support users at the workstations. Power receptacles are typically provided below or at the top surfaces for powering devices (e.g., computers, chargers, lighting, etc.). Storage requirements are often met by providing case goods that either mount to the undersurfaces of the top members or in some fashion to the leg structures. Other accessories such as computer shelves, screens, lighting devices, paper holders and the like are known and often are mechanically mounted to undersurfaces or edges of the top members or to the support leg structure. While benching systems have proven particularly useful in certain applications, known benching systems have several shortcomings. First, some benching systems have been designed to have a minimal number of component parts and are supposed to be easy to assemble without the use of tools or with minimal tool use. Unfortunately, in these cases, the resulting benching assemblies are often wobbly and do not have a quality look and feel after assembly and during used. Second, some benching systems have been developed that include a large number of components and mechanical linkages between components in order to provide a relatively high quality look and feel. Here, however, quality look and feel and accessory support typically increase expense appreciably and, because of their relative complexity, these systems typically require multi-step assembly of a large number of components and use of many specialized tools which make it difficult at best for an untrained person to assembly a configuration. Moreover, when optimal configuration requirements change (i.e., five workstations are required instead of eight), system complexity discourages reconfiguration resulting in non-optimal use of space. Third, with the exception of adding on additional workstations to an existing configuration, known benching systems are not particularly reconfigurable for purposes other than workstation use. Thus, for instance, where a benching assembly currently includes eight workstations in a four facing four configuration and only five workstations are required, it may be advantageous to be able to reconfigure the configuration so that two of the stations could be used as general seating in the area and a third of the stations could be eliminated. Known benching systems cannot be reconfigured in this manner. Fourth, no known benching system allows the components of a single workstation assembly to be used in their entirely in a face to face two person workstation assembly which is a particularly useful capability as it enables the useful face to face arrangement while still allowing odd numbers of workstations to be configured together for optimally supporting any number of users. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has been recognized that a reconfigurable benching system can be provided that includes a simplified core frame structure and an additional small number of components that can be assembled in many different ways to suit optimal configuration requirements and that can be disassembled just as easily to reconfigure when desired. Assembly components have been designed specifically so that assembly thereof is intuitive, easy, and requires few (e.g., one), if any, tools. The core frame structure is assembled first and thereafter other components are added one at a time until an entire desired configuration is completed. As additional components are added to the core frame structure, the additional components and core frame structure cooperate to increase rigidity of the overall assembly until an extremely sturdy assembly results. The components together act as a web to increase rigidity. The core frame structure includes first and second leg members and a rigid channel or rail member that extends between and mounts to the first and second leg members. Each leg member includes a horizontal support surface or rail lip that has a length dimension. The channel or rail member can be mounted to each leg member at more than one location along the rail lip. For instance, the channel/rail member can be mounted centrally along each rail lip to divide a frame space between facing surfaces of the leg members into front and rear spaces and different furniture assemblies can be mounted at least partially within the front and rear spaces or the channel/rail member can be mounted at rear ends of the lip members so that the frame space between the leg members resides to a front side of the rail lips and a single furniture assembly can be mounted within the frame space. The channel/rail members is mounted to the legs for sliding movement along the length dimension of the legs so that channel position can be modified quickly. The components in addition to the leg members and the channel/rail member include support or bracket members, trough members and table top members that can all be mounted within the frame space or generally within a space defined by facing surfaces of the leg members. In some embodiments different table top sizes are optional and a seating or lounge subassembly may also optionally be positioned within a frame space. For shipping, the assembly components can be disassembled and shipped in relatively small and flat boxes to save costs. To this end, at their base level, most of the assembly components break down into elongated members that can easily stack up into compact spaces. In at least some embodiments each of the leg members includes oppositely facing lateral surfaces where each of the lateral surfaces forms at least one mounting slot and/or lip members for mounting table top members, trough members, a channel member, etc. Here, a single leg member can be used to support tables, troughs, etc., on either side so that several workstations can be configured in a side-by-side fashion if desired.

It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure. Referring now to the drawings wherein like reference numerals correspond to similar elements throughout the several views and, more specifically, referring to FIG. 1, the present invention will initially be described in the context of an exemplary single workstation desk/table configuration 10 that includes a small number of basic components. Referring also to FIG. 2, configuration 10 includes first and second leg assemblies 12a and 12b (also referred to as leg members hereafter), a table top assembly 14, a trough member 16, a wire management channel assembly or member 18 and first and second arm support members 15. In general, the leg assemblies 12a and 12b are spaced apart such that a frame space 13 (see phantom in FIG. 2) is formed there between. Channel assembly 18 is mounted at opposite ends between the leg assemblies 12a and 12b and near back or rear portions thereof to form a rigid frame construction. Arm members 15 are mounted to facing surfaces of leg assemblies 12a and 12b with distal ends thereof extending generally in a direction away from channel assembly 18 (i.e., members 15 extend in a forward direction). Trough member 16 is mounted between leg members 12a and 12b within frame space 13 and is supported by an adjacent front edge of channel assembly 18 as well as top support surfaces of arm support members 15. Table top member 14 is supported along a rear edge by an adjacent support surface formed by trough member 16 as well as by the distal ends of arm members 15 within frame space 13. Thus, in general all of the configuration 10 components in addition to leg assemblies 12a and 12b are located within frame space 13 between facing surfaces of assemblies 12a and 12b after assembly. Referring again to FIG. 1, each of leg assemblies 12a and 12b is similarly constructed and operates in a similar fashion and therefore, in the interest of simplifying this explanation, only leg assembly 12a will be described here in detail. Referring also to FIGS. 3 and 4, exemplary leg assembly 12a includes four elongated members as well as two cover assemblies 40 (only one shown in FIG. 3). The elongated members include first and second generally vertical members 20 and 22, respectively, an upper horizontal rail member 24 and a lower horizontal rail member 26. Each of the vertical members 20 and 22 is similarly constructed and operates in a similar fashion and therefore, only member 20 is described here in detail. Member 20 has a lower end and an upper end and, referring also to FIG. 5, forms an upper rail mounting plate 70 near the upper end and a lower rail mounting plate 72. The plates 70 and 72 have cross-sections that are similar in shape to the cross-sections of rail members 24 and 26, respectively, and include features that facilitate alignment and connection of the rails to the plates. To this end, plate 70 includes four alignment ribs 74 that extend from the face of the plate 70 and that are received within a slot 63 formed by rail 24 as shown in FIG. 4. Similarly, four ribs 74 are formed on the surface of plate 72 for alignment with a slot (not labeled) formed by rail 26 (see again FIG. 4). A pair of apertures are formed through each of the plates 70 and 72 that align with screw channels (see 62 in FIG. 4) formed by rails 24 and 26, respectively, when the rails 24 and 26 are mounted to the plates 70 and 72. Referring still to FIGS. 3 through 5 and also to FIG. 6, on a side of member 20 opposite plates 70 and 72, member 20 forms an opening 89 into a recessed space 91 where bolt heads associated with bolts that extend through openings 76 can be recessed. Opening 89 wraps around a top surface of member 20 to form an upper surface open slot 90 useful for attaching additional components (e.g., an arch) above leg assembly 12a (see FIGS. 49 and 50 described below). The structure within the recess also forms two additional openings 86 for securing one of the covers 40 (see again FIG. 3) via screws (see FIG. 7) to member 20 to close off the recessed space 91 and provide a finished look to member 20. Referring to FIG. 7, cover assembly 40 includes a generally flat metal cover plate 41 with a lip 43 at a top end as well as two metal posts 100 that form threaded apertures at distal ends where the posts 100 extend from an internal surface of plate 41. Cover 40 is installed by aligning the post 100 apertures with openings 86 and using two screws 39 to secure cover 40 via holes 86. Once installed cover plate 41 is flush with an external surface of vertical member 20. Referring to FIG. 4, rails 24 and 26 are shown in cross-section. Each of rails 24 and 26 comprises an extruded aluminum member and, as shown in FIG. 4, the rails 24 and 26 have identical cross-sections. When leg assembly 12a is assembled, if rail 24 is considered to be upright, rail 26 is inverted with respect to rail 24. Because the rails 24 and 26 have similar cross-sections, only rail 24 will be described here in detail in order to simplify this explanation. Referring still to FIG. 4, rail 24 is generally square in cross-section and includes a top wall member 65, a bottom wall member 64, and first and second lateral or side wall members 34 and 32, respectively. Rail 24 has a number of interesting characteristics. First, a top surface 28 of top wall member 65 is substantially flat. Second, rail 24 forms T-slots 30 and 46 in opposite side wall members 34 and 32, respectively. Third, rail 24 forms an inverted internal “T” shaped slot 63 that cooperates with ribs 74 (see again FIG. 5) that extend from plate 70 for aligning rail 24 with plate 70 during assembly. Fourth, rail 24 forms two screw channels 62 within internal slot 63 that align with the screw holes 76 formed by member 20 when ribs 74 are received in slot 63. Fifth, side wall members 34 and 32 extend downward past an external surface of lower wall member 64 and thereby form rail lip members or coupling members or fingers 44 and 50, respectively. In FIG. 4, one of the side wall slots 48 and one of the rail lips 52 formed by lower rail member 26 are labeled so those features can be distinguished hereafter. Referring now to FIGS. 3 and 7, to assemble the rail members 24 and 26 and leg members 20 and 22 to form the leg assembly 12a, rails 24 and 26 are aligned with plates 70 and 72 and are moved toward the plates until ribs 74 are received within slots 63 (see also FIGS. 4 and 5) formed by rail members 24 and 26. When ribs 74 are aligned with slots 63, the holes 76 formed by members 20 and 22 are aligned with screw channels 62 formed by rail members 24 and 26. Bolts 98 are slid through holes 76 and are threadably received within channels 62 to secure rail members 24 and 26 to vertical members 20 and 22. Referring again to FIG. 6, upon installation of bolts 98, the bolt heads are received within recesses space 91 adjacent holes 76 and therefore are located within the top ends of members 20 and 22. Next, covers 40 are aligned with openings 89 at the top ends of members 20 and 22 and are attached by pressing sphere members 100 into openings 86 so that sphere members 100 are frictionally received therein. Referring again to FIGS. 2 through 4, leg assembly 12a forms a top surface 28, a front surface 11, a rear surface 7, leg opening 38 and first and second side surfaces 58 and 60 after assembly. Once rails 24 and 26 are secured to the vertical members 20 and 22, the lips 50 and 52 formed by the bottom walls of the rail members extend toward each other. For example, as shown in FIG. 4, lip member 50 formed by rail 24 is aligned with and extends toward lip member 52 formed by rail member 26. A frame or leg opening 38 is formed between rails 24 and 26. Referring now to FIGS. 8 through 11, channel assembly 18 includes an elongated rigid housing member 110, a plurality of receptacles 112 and 113 and first and second clamping coupler assemblies or expansion jaw assemblies 114 and 116. Housing member 110 is generally formed of bent sheet metal and extends between first and second opposite ends 121 and 123, respectively. The housing member 110 forms an upper channel or cavity 126 and a lower channel or cavity 132. To form the channels, housing member 110 includes first and second side walls 118 and 120 on front and rear sides, respectively, a bottom wall 122 and an intermediate dividing or floor member 127. A top end of the housing 110 is open at 125 along a channel length dimension. The side walls 118 and 120 are generally vertical and angle away from each other generally from top to bottom to a small degree (e.g., a 10° angle with respect to vertical). Each of the side wall members 118 and 120 forms openings (see 150 in FIG. 8) for passing power or data wires into and out of the upper channel 126. In addition, each of the wall members 118 and 120 forms other openings for receiving power outlet receptacles 112 that can be arranged to face the exterior of assembly 18 so that the outlets are accessible from outside assembly 18. In the illustrated embodiment shown in FIG. 8, each of the wall members 118 and 120 forms a single access opening 150 as well as a single central power receptacle opening for mounting a receptacle 112 while the openings 150 and receptacle openings may be preformed, in some embodiments knockout panels may be formed within the openings where the panels initially close the openings and can be removed by a user if desired by applying force to the panels. An exemplary knockout panel 800 is shown in phantom in FIG. 8. Referring now to FIG. 10, at a top end wall member 118 is bent toward wall member 120, then upward and again outward thereby forming an elongated channel 148 and a channel support surface 142 along a length dimension of the housing 110 that extends between the first and second ends 121 and 123, respectively. Similarly, along a top edge, wall member 120 also forms an channel 146 and a support surface 140 along its length dimension where channel 146 opens in a direction opposite the direction in which channel 148 opens channel housing 110 forms a top surface 141 (see FIG. 10). Referring still to FIGS. 8 through 11, bottom wall member 122 generally closes off the space between lower edges of side wall members 118 and 120 and extends between the first and second ends 121 and 123, respectively. Bottom wall member 122 forms relatively large openings 160 (see FIG. 10) along its length for allowing power or data cables to be strung into an out of the lower channel 132 and to allow access to components mounted within housing 110 for installation, adjustment, etc. Referring specifically to FIGS. 9 and 10, intermediate wall member 127 is mounted between internal surfaces of side wall members 118 and 120 and divides the space between wall member 118 and 120 essentially into the upper and lower channels 126 and 132. Intermediate member 127 forms openings in which additional power or data outlet receptacles 113 are mounted (see FIGS. 9 and 10). Lower channel 132 is used for running power/data wires. Upper channel 126 is used for plugging in cords from lights, computers, etc., and for storing excess power/data connecting cables. Referring to FIGS. 8, 10 and 11, at each of the distal ends 121 and 123, assembly 18 includes a rigid metal top cross member 124 and a rigid metal intermediate cross member 128. The top cross member 124 is welded or otherwise attached between top ends of side wall members 118 and 120 and includes an internal surface 147 (see FIG. 11) to which one of the coupling assemblies 114 or 116 is welded or otherwise attached. Intermediate cross member 128 is also a rigid metal member that is welded or otherwise secured between wall members 118 and 120 and includes a lip member or stationary finger or coupler 130 along a lower edge that extends outward and downward from a distal end. Referring once again to FIGS. 8, 10 and 11, coupling assemblies 114 and 116 are similarly constructed and operate in a similar fashion and therefore, in the interest of simplifying this explanation, only coupling assembly 114 is described in detail. Coupling assembly 114 includes a support bracket 164, a clamping bolt 163 and a coupler block or moveable jaw member 166. Bracket 164 includes an integrally formed flat support plate 167 and a plurality of wall members that extend downward from edges of the support plate 167. One of the downward extending wall members is a guide wall 166 that extends along an edge opposite the edge of plate 167 that is secured to surface 147 (see FIG. 11). Plate 167 forms an opening for passing a threaded shaft 170 of bolt 163 and also forms guide slots 162 (only one shown in FIG. 11) near the edge of plate 167 that mounts to surface 147. Jaw member 166 is generally U-shaped in cross-section (see FIG. 10) including a flat bottom wall member 197 and first and second parallel wall members 199 that extend along opposite edges of bottom wall member 197. Bottom wall member 197 forms a threaded opening 193 for receiving shaft 170. As best seen in FIG. 11, top edges of side wall members 199 undulate to form a lip or moveable finger member 134 at one end, an intermediate guide finger extension 162 and an end finger extension 207 at a second end opposite lip 134 where lip 134 and extensions 162 and 207 all extend away from bottom wall member 197 in the same direction. The dimensions of, and spacing between, members 134, 162 and 207 are such that when an edge of member 207 contacts an internal surface of wall member 171 (see FIG. 11) with shaft 170 passing through plate 167 and threadably received in opening 193. Finger extensions 162 are aligned with openings 161 in plate 167 and lips 134 extend past an adjacent edge of plate 167. To install assembly 114, bracket 164 is welded or otherwise secured to cross member 124. Jaw member 166 is placed with intermediate finger members 162 aligned with openings 161 and with finger members 207 adjacent the internal surface of wall member 166 and with the opening in plate 162 aligned with threaded opening 193. Shaft 170 is fed through plate 167 and into opening 193. At this point jaw member 134 extends out an end opening formed by housing 110 as shown in FIG. 11. Referring again to FIG. 11, as bolt 163 is rotated, jaw member 166 and finger member 134 move up and down. Jaw member 166 is restricted from rotating by intermediate finger members 162 and openings 161 as well as by finger members 207 that ride along the internal surface of wall member 171. Lip 130 and lip 134 form a coupler pair and a similar coupler pair is located at the second end 123 of assembly 18. As illustrated, the bolt 163 and bracket 164 are entirely located inside channel 126. Referring again to FIG. 2, each of the arm support or bracket support members 15 is similarly constructed and operates in a similar fashion and again, in the interest of simplifying this explanation, only one of the support members 15 will be described here in detail. Referring also to FIGS. 12 and 13, exemplary support member 15 is a rigid elongated metal member having a proximal or connecting end 180 and a distal end 182 where proximal and distal portions 181 and 183 are located at the proximal and distal ends 180 and 182, respectively. The proximal portion 181 has a generally uniform cross section along its length as shown in FIG. 13 that includes a vertical member 186 and a horizontal shelf member 184 that extends at a right angle from a top edge of vertical member 186. Shelf member 184 has a distal edge 200 along its length. Vertical member 186 forms a bearing surface 185 on a side opposite the side from which shelf member 184 extends. Shelf member 184 forms a substantially horizontal upper support surface 187. In addition to vertical member 186 and shelf member 184, proximal portion 181 also includes a lip member 190 that extends from the top end of vertical member 186 along a direction which is generally opposite the direction in which shelf member 184 extends. Lip member 190 includes an arm member 192 and a distal lip or finger member 194 that extends vertically upward from a distal end of member 192. Referring also to FIG. 26, lip member 190 is shaped and dimensioned so as to be receivable within one of the slots (e.g., 46 in FIG. 26) formed by rail member 24 such that vertical member 186 extends vertically downward therefrom and bearing surface 185 rests against the outer surface of the wall member 32 that forms the slot 46 when lip member 90 is received in the slot. Referring to FIG. 12, the distal portion 183 has a cross section along most of its length that is similar to the cross section in FIG. 13, albeit not including lip member 190. Distal portion 183 extends at an angle α with respect to proximal portion 181. In at least some embodiments angle α is between zero and 60 degrees and in some cases angle α is between ten and twenty-five degrees. At the distal end 182 member 15 only includes the vertical member 186 and does not include shelf member 184. Shelf member 184 forms an opening 196 near distal end 182 and forms a key member 203 that extends perpendicular to member 184. The distal end of member 186 is referred to hereafter as a finger member 198. Referring again to FIG. 12, a shoulder member 620 extends from an edge of and co-planar with shelf member 184 in a direction opposite lip member 190. Referring now to FIGS. 14 through 19, exemplary trough member 16 is an elongated rigid body member that extends between first and second opposite ends 216 and 218, respectively. In at least some cases, trough member 16 is formed of rigid plastic via a vacuum forming process that is particularly suited for forming a feature rich trough member that includes a bottom wall member 225 including undulations that can define different trough depths and other interesting features useful for dividing a trough space 228 into several different trough sub-compartments particularly suitable for specific purposes. In other embodiments the trough member may be formed of bent metal. Referring specifically to FIGS. 15 and 16, generally, trough member 16 includes a front wall member 212, a rear wall member 214, a first side wall member 231, a second side wall member 233 and a floor or bottom wall member 225. The front and rear wall members 212 and 214 and side wall members 231 and 233 are spaced apart to generally define a rectilinear trough space 228 and bottom wall member 225 generally closes off the bottom end of space 228 while the top end is left open to facilitate access into the trough space. At upper ends of the front and rear wall members 212 and 214 and the side wall members 231 and 233, an outwardly extending lip member 220 is formed. Lip member 220 forms an upper surface 221 as well as a lower surface 229. A trough width dimension generally between the front and rear wall members 212 and 214 is generally between three and twenty-two inches and, in some embodiments is around 18 inches. Referring still to FIGS. 14 through 19, bottom wall member 225 has different depth portions (e.g., from three to twenty inches) along the length dimension of trough member 16. For example, referring to FIG. 17, a general depth portion of trough space 228 is illustrated where the depth is labeled D1. Referring to FIGS. 14, 15 and 16, a left most portion 230 of the trough space forms a further recessed portion 240 having a depth D2 which is greater than depth D1. Here, for instance, depth D2 may be one inch deeper than depth D1 and provide a space for storing pencils, pens, a stapler, a scissors, etc. Referring to FIGS. 14, 15 and 19, at a right most portion of the trough space as illustrated in FIGS. 14 and 15, the lower wall 225 extends to a depth D3 to form a file bin 252 portion suitable for receiving standard size office files or the like. Referring still to FIGS. 14 and 15 and also to FIG. 18, centrally, trough bottom wall 225 forms an internal surface 246 that slants from the bottom edge of front wall member 212 downward to a location below the bottom edge of wall member 214 to form a wire access space 234. Here, bottom wall 225 also forms an opening 250 below rear wall member 214. Referring also to FIG. 25, opening 250 is formed at a location that aligns with one of the outlet receptacles 212 mounted in the channel housing member 110 when the overall assembly shown in FIG. 1 is configured. Because trough member 16 is formed of a plastic material, while rigid, member 16 is also relatively flimsy and therefore, while sufficient for supporting most office supplies, member 16 alone cannot withstand greater loads without potentially bending or flexing along its length dimension. After assembly, as shown in FIG. 25, the rear edge of trough member 16 is received within channel 148 formed by channel housing member 110 and therefore the rear edge of trough member 16 is additionally supported. To help support the front edge portion of trough member 16, a metal stringer member 251 is secured to the outer surface of front wall member 212 just below lip member 220 via screws, rivets, an adhesive, or some other type of mechanical fastener. Stringer member 251 extends the length of trough member 16 between ends 216 and 218 (see again FIG. 14) to provide support along the entire length dimension of trough member 16. As seen in FIG. 16, stringer member 251 is generally L-shaped including a first member 235 and a second or extending member 226 that extends along a length of dimension of member 235 and forms a slightly obtuse angle with member 235. Stringer member 251 is mounted with first member 235 mounted to the external surface of member 212 and member 226 disposed under and extending past a distal edge of lip member 220. The distal portion of extending member 226 forms a top trough support surface (i.e., a support surface associated with the trough member 16 that supports a table top as described hereafter). Referring now to FIGS. 21 and 22, table top assembly 14 includes a table top member 279, first and second edge brackets 278, a metal strengthening runner 276 and first and second coupling assemblies 280. Top member 279 is a rigid rectilinear member that extends along a length dimension between side edges 272 and 274 and that has oppositely facing front and rear edges 287 and 285, respectively. Member 279 also has a top surface (see FIG. 1) and a bottom surface 270. Brackets 278, strengthening runner 276 and coupling assemblies 280 are all mounted to bottom surface 270 of top member 279. Referring still to FIG. 21 and also to FIG. 26, each of the edge brackets 278 has a generally flattened S-shape (best seen in FIG. 26) including a mounting plate 279, an arm plate 299 and a finger member 301. The mounting plate 297 is flat and rectilinear and mounts to the undersurface of top member 270. Arm plate 299 forms an angle with mounting plate 297 so that a distal end is spaced apart from the undersurface of top member 270 and finger member 301 extends from the distal end of arm plate 299 and is generally parallel to mounting plate 297 such that finger member 301 and the undersurface of top member 270 form a slot. The width of the slot is similar to a thickness of the runner member 236 that extends along the length of trough member 16 as shown in FIG. 26. Edge brackets 278, as best shown in FIG. 21, are mounted adjacent rear edge 285 and adjacent lateral edges 272 and 274 of top member 279. Referring again to FIGS. 21 and 22, strengthening runner 276 is a bent sheet metal member that extends along the length dimension of, and is attached to, the undersurface 270 of top member 279 where distal ends are spaced apart from side edges 272 and 274. Member 276 is located generally along front edge 278 of top member 279. Runner 276 provides additional strength for top member 279 along the front edge thereof. Referring specifically to FIG. 22, at each end, strengthening runner 280 forms an edge 451 that is generally perpendicular to undersurface 270. In addition, spaced apart from edge 311, runner 276 includes a relatively small finger member 286 (see also FIGS. 29 and 30) that extends generally perpendicular to bottom surface 270 such that the edge of member 286 facing strengthening runner edge 450 and edge 450 form a slot 288. Slot 288 has a width dimension that is slightly greater than the width of finger member 198 at the distal end of arm support member 15 as shown in FIG. 12. Opening 610 is sized and dimensioned to receive key member 203 on support member 15 (see again FIG. 12). Referring still to FIG. 22, a metal stud 282 is embedded (e.g., adhered within an opening) in the undersurface 270 proximate slot 288 so that when alignment member 203 (see again FIG. 12) is received in slot 610, opening 196 is aligned with a threaded opening formed by the metal stud 282. Referring now to FIGS. 1, 2, 8 and 9, to assemble the configuration shown in FIG. 1, initially, coupling assemblies 114 and 116 are loosened so that finger members 134 are generally spaced apart from top cross members 124. Next, holding one of the leg assemblies 12a in an upright position as shown in FIG. 23, channel assembly 18 is aligned with the top end of the leg assembly 12a so that lip members 134 and 130 are generally aligned with opening 38 formed between rail members 24 and 26. Channel assembly 18 is moved toward the external surface 60 of leg assembly 12a until lip members 134 and 130 are located within the space between rail lip members 50 and 52 and then is moved downward until lip member 52 is received by lip member 130. The second leg member 12a is temporarily attached to the opposite end of channel assembly 18 in a similar fashion. To assemble the FIG. 1 configuration 10, channel assembly 18 is located at rear portions of leg assemblies 12a and 12b so that most of the frame space 13 is to a front side of assembly 18 (see FIG. 25). Referring still to FIG. 23, bolt 163 is rotated causing jaw member 164 and associated lip 134 to move upward until lip member 134 catches rail lip 50. Upon further tightening of bolt 163, channel member 18 is tightly secured to leg assembly 12a. The other coupling assembly 116 is similarly tightened to secure the opposite end of channel member 18 to second leg assembly 12b. At this point, frame space 13 is defined by the facing surfaces of leg members 12a and 12b, where the frame space has a rear edge portion adjacent channel assembly 18 and a front edge portion near leg member front surfaces 11 and an intermediate portion between the front and rear portions. Referring to FIG. 29, channel assembly 18 is spaced 700 slightly (e.g., ½ inch) from the rear surface of the leg assemblies 12a, 12b and top surface 141 is flush with the top surfaces 28 of leg members 12a and 12b. Referring again to FIG. 23, after channel member 18 is secured to one of the leg assemblies 12a, the portion of the upper rail slot 46 aligned with the top opening 114 in the upper channel 126 is exposed within the opening 114. Thus, in at least some cases additional optional accessories may be mounted to upper rail 24 via the exposed portion of slot 46 (e.g., see clips 552 in FIG. 23 that help to attach a privacy screen 540 (see also FIG. 54 described below). Referring again to FIG. 2 and also now to FIG. 24, arm support members 15 are next attached to facing surfaces of leg assemblies 12a and 12b. To this end, the upwardly extending lip member 190 of one of the arm members 15 is aligned with the T-slot 46 formed by top rail 24 and is manipulated there into so that lip member 190 extends into the slot 46 and bearing surface 185 bears against an outer surface of wall member 32 that forms slot 46 (see also FIG. 27). The other arm member 15 is attached to the other leg assembly 12b in a similar fashion. At this point, the sub-assembly appears as shown in FIG. 25. Referring again to FIG. 2 and also to FIG. 26, trough member 16 is next installed. To this end, the rear edge of lip member 220 is aligned with channel 148 formed by channel assembly housing 110 and is moved into the channel 148 while the front edge portion of the trough member is held up above the supporting surfaces of the arm members 15. Once the rear portion of lip member 220 is received within channel 148, the front edge portion of trough member 16 can be lowered until the undersurface of lip member 220 bears against the top support surfaces 184 of support members 15. At this point the sub-assembly configured has the appearance shown in FIG. 28. Referring again to FIGS. 21 and 26, to mount table assembly 14 to the sub-assembly shown in FIG. 28, the table assembly 14 is positioned with the rear edge 285 adjacent the front edge portion 236 of runner 251 and so that brackets 278 are generally aligned with shoulder members 620 formed by support members 15 (see FIG. 12). Top assembly 14 is moved toward through member 16 until shoulder members 620 are sandwiched between the table top member undersurface 270 and clip member 301. In at least some embodiments the end portions of runner lip member 226 may also be sandwiched between undersurface 270 and clip member 301. Next, front edge 287 portion of table top assembly 14 is rotated downward above the distal ends of arm members 15 with slots 610 aligned with key members 203 (see FIGS. 12 and 22). While the front edge portion of the table assembly is being lowered, key members 203 slide into slots 610. In addition, finger members 198 formed at the distal ends of support arm members 15 are received within slots 288 between edge 451 of strengthening runner 176 and the facing edge of finger member 286 as shown in FIGS. 29 and 30. Finger tightenable bolts 630 are passed through openings 196 (see FIG. 12) and are threadably received in studs 282 to secure top member 297 to arm support members 15. Together, the mating between pin 282 and opening 196, the mating between finger member 198 and slot 288 and mating between bolts 630 and studs 282 securely connect top member 279 to arm members 15. Referring once again to FIG. 1, at this point the configuration shown in FIG. 1 is completely assembled. See also FIG. 31 that shows the configuration of FIG. 1 in a top plan view. Referring again to FIG. 1, top member 279 has a thickness dimension such that after installation, top surface 9 of member 279 is at a height that is flush with the top surfaces 28 of leg assemblies 12a and 12b. Similarly, referring also to FIG. 10, the top surface 141 of channel housing 110 is at a height that is flush with top surfaces 28 of leg assemblies 12a and 12b after installation (see also FIG. 23). Referring to FIG. 26, a top surface 221 of trough lip member 220 is recessed below (e.g., one-quarter inch) the top surfaces of the leg assemblies 12a and 12b. Referring once again to FIG. 16, in at least some embodiments it is contemplated that one or more sliding board or plate members may be provided that are dimensioned to be received on the shelf support surface 221 for sliding motion along the length dimension of trough member 16. Referring also to FIG. 32, exemplary sliding board members 292 and 294 are illustrated that may be placed on the shelf support 221 as shown. Board members 292 and 294 have thicknesses such that, when supported on surface 221, top surfaces of the boards are generally at the same height as top surface 9 of table top member 279. Thus, with boards 292 and 294 installed, the top surfaces thereof operate to provide additional work surface space if desired. Referring now to FIG. 33, a second exemplary configuration 300 that is consistent with various aspects of the present invention is illustrated. This second configuration 300 includes all of the components described above with respect to the first configuration 10 as well as some additional components. To this end, configuration 300 includes first and second leg assemblies 12a and 12b, table top assembly 14, trough member 16 and channel assembly 18. In addition, second configuration 300 includes a second table top assembly 14a and a second trough assembly 16a. Configuration 300 is also shown with first and second sliding board or plate members 292 and 294 supported by the shelf surface of trough member 16a. To configure the configuration 300 shown in FIG. 33, the configuration shown in FIG. 1 can simply be reconfigured. To reconfigure the configuration shown in FIG. 1, referring to FIG. 34, the coupling assemblies 114 and 116 can be loosened so that channel assembly 18 can be slid along the openings 38 (see again FIG. 1) to a central location with respect to, or to an intermediate portion of, leg assemblies 12a and 12b. When channel assembly 18 is slid, trough member 16 and table assembly 14 slide therewith into the positions shown in FIG. 34 where trough member 16 and table assembly 14 are generally adjacent front end portions of leg assemblies 12a and 12b. In addition, referring again to FIGS. 12 and 34, arm support members 15 slide to the locations shown in phantom in FIG. 34 where distal portions 183 thereof extend past the front surfaces 11 and forward of the frame space 13. Next, the coupling assemblies 114 and 116 can be tightened to secure channel assembly 18 in the central position. At this point, table assembly 14 extends past the front surfaces 15 of leg assemblies 12a and 12b but is still solidly supported by the distal ends of the support arm members 15 and the strengthening member 276 there below. Referring still to FIG. 34, third and fourth arm support members 15a are attached to the facing surfaces of leg assemblies 12a and 12b in an similar fashion to that described above with respect to members 15, albeit with the distal ends of arm members 15a extending in a rearward direction. Trough member 16a is attached with the rear edge thereof received in the second channel 146 (see again FIG. 10) formed by channel housing member 110 and side portions thereof supported by the top support surfaces formed by support arm members 15a. Table top assembly 14a is attached to the front edge of trough member 16a and distal portions of the top surfaces formed by arm members 15a. A top plan view of the resulting configuration 300 is shown in FIG. 35 where it can be seen that table assembly 14a and trough member 16a are generally adjacent rear end portions of leg assemblies 12a and 12b. Thus, it should be appreciated that the configuration 10 in FIG. 1 can be reconfigured easily and intuitively to use all of the assembly 10 components from a single person workstation to configure a two person face-to-face workstation that includes a pair of table tops supported at least in part within the frame space formed by the facing surfaces of leg assemblies 12a and 12b. As shown, the table tops 14 and 14a form a split top space between facing rear edges where trough members 16 and 16a as well as channel assembly 18 are located in the split top space and are supported by the leg members. The sliding capability of channel assembly 18 with respect to the leg openings 39 (see again FIG. 1) enables fast and easy one-to-two station reconfiguration and vice versa. In addition to the embodiments described above, additional components like those described above can be continually added to a configuration to configure additional work spaces for additional users. To this end, referring again to FIG. 33, after configuration 300 is configured, the outer exposed surfaces of leg assemblies 12a and 12b have slot and lip arrangements that can be used to secure additional channel assemblies 18 and support arms (see again FIG. 12) that can in turn support additional trough members 16 and table assemblies 14. In this regard, see now FIG. 36 that shows yet another partially assembled workstation configuration 320 that is consistent with at least some aspects of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 36, the configuration 320 includes an instance 300 of the configuration shown in FIG. 33 plus additional components 300a for forming two additional workstations. The additional components include a second channel assembly 18a, four additional support arm members 15b and 15c, third and fourth trough members 16b and 16c, third and fourth table top assemblies 14b and 14c and a third leg assembly 12c. Here, second channel assembly 18a is mounted to a surface of leg assembly 12b opposite the surface to which channel assembly 18 is mounted and extends in line with and parallel to channel assembly 18 to a second end that is securely connected to one of the side surfaces of leg assembly 12c. Support arm members 15b and 15c are mounted to facing surfaces of leg assemblies 12b and 12c to extend in opposite directions, trough members 16b and 16c are installed and table top assemblies 14b and 14c are installed. The resulting “four pack” of workstations 320 is illustrated in FIG. 37 in top plan view. Referring still to FIG. 36, the components that comprise configuration 320 generally include two overlapping pairs of leg members including a first pair 12a, 12b and a second pair 12b and 12c where each pair of adjacent leg members forms a separate frame space and where a separate pair of table tops (e.g., 14b and 14c) are supported at least partially within each frame space. Although not shown, additional leg members and table top pairs can be provided to construct additional face-to-face workstations in a similar fashion. In this regard, an additional leg member may be spaced apart from an existing member to form another pair of adjacent leg members that define another frame space and a pair of table top members can then be mounted within the additional frame space. After assembly 320 has been configured, the wire passing openings at adjacent ends of channel assemblies 18 and 18a are aligned and both open into the leg openings 38 (see again FIG. 1) formed by central leg assembly 12b so that power/data wires can be directly routed from one channel assembly 18 to the next 18a. Other configurations are contemplated. For example, referring now to FIG. 38, yet one additional configuration 330 is illustrated that is consistent with at least some aspects of the present invention. Configuration 330 includes an instance of the configuration 300 shown above in FIG. 33 as well as additional components 332 attached to configuration 300 to form a third workstation. The additional components 332 include a second channel assembly 18a, a third trough member 16b, a third table top assembly 14b and a third leg assembly 12c. Second channel assembly 18a is mounted to a side of leg member 12b opposite the side on which channel assembly 18 is mounted and extends parallel to channel assembly 18. Here, however, second channel assembly 18a is not directly aligned with channel assembly 18 and is instead offset to the rear portion of leg assemblies 12b and 12c in a fashion similar to that described above with respect to assembly 10 in FIG. 1. The trough member 16b and table top assembly 14b are then attached to the leg assemblies 12b and 12c and channel assembly 18a as described above. In the case of configuration 330, while channel assemblies 18 and 18a are not aligned, both assemblies 18 and 18a open into the large leg opening 38 (see again FIG. 1) and therefore power/data wires can be routed from assembly 18 through the leg opening 38 and into assembly 18a. Although not illustrated, many other workstations may be strung on to either side of one of the above described assemblies in a fashion similar to that described above to configure any number of desired workstations (e.g., five, eight, twenty, etc.). All of the embodiments described above include different “inserts” or rigid furniture components or furniture assemblies that can be mounted between leg assemblies 12 to configure different overall workstation configurations. For instance, in the case of the FIG. 1 configuration 10, the “furniture assembly” that can be secured between first and second leg assemblies 12a and 12b includes channel assembly 18, trough member 16 and table top assembly 14 (i.e., a first rigid furniture component). In the case of second configuration 300 shown in FIG. 33 above, in addition to the first furniture assembly, a second furniture assembly is included that includes trough member 16a and second table top assembly 14a (i.e., a second rigid furniture component). In at least some embodiments it is contemplated that additional different types of furniture assemblies may be provided that can be installed between a pair of leg assemblies 12 to provide yet additional furniture configurations. For example, referring to FIG. 39, an exemplary additional configuration 340 is shown that includes a seating or lounge furniture assembly or sub-assembly 344 that has been substituted for the trough member 16 and table top assembly 14 shown in FIG. 33. Referring to FIGS. 40 and 41, lounge sub-assembly 344 includes a lounge or sofa-type structure 352 (i.e., a third rigid furniture component), first and second lounge brackets 346 and finger tightening locking bolts 350. Lounge structure 352 forms a seating structure and includes an undersurface 354 and first and second side surfaces 355 and 357. The lounge structure 352 is dimensioned such that its length is substantially identical to the length dimension of channel assembly 18 described above so that lounge structure 352 can fit snuggly between facing surfaces of leg assemblies 12a and 12b when channel assembly 18 is connected there between. Lounge bracket 346 includes a large rectangular plate 360 that forms a lip 362 that extends to a first side of plate 360 and that has a form and dimensions similar to lip 190 shown in FIGS. 12 and 13. Along an edge opposite the edge from which lip member 362 extends, a shelf member 364 extends in a direction opposite the direction in which the lip member 362 extends. Member 364 forms two openings 368 for passing locking bolts 350. Along a front edge of plate member 360, a flange 366 extends generally perpendicular to plate member 360 and in a direction opposite the direction in which shelf member 364 extends. Referring once again to FIG. 39, initially it is assumed that channel assembly 18 is securely connected between leg assemblies 12a and 12b. Referring also to FIGS. 40 and 42, to install lounge sub-assembly 344, first brackets 346 are attached to the leg members 12a and 12b. To attach a bracket to a leg assembly, the lip member 362 is generally aligned with one of the upper rail slots 46 and is manipulated there into. Next, bracket 346 is rotate downward about the slot 348 until a rear surface of plate member 360 contact an adjacent side surface 60 of member 22. Here, flange member 366 extends in front of and generally contacts a front surface 11 of leg assembly 12a to restrict movement of the bracket 346 with respect to slot 48. Next, lounge structure 352 is aligned with the space between brackets 346 and is slid there into and set down on the shelf members 364 as shown in FIG. 42. Finger tightenable bolts 350 are slid through the bracket openings 368 and into threaded apertures in the undersurface 354 of lounge structure 352 to secure the lounge structure in place. The resulting configuration 340 is again shown in FIG. 39. Referring to FIG. 43, another exemplary configuration 380 is illustrated that includes one of the configurations 300 shown in FIG. 33 as well as one of the lounge structures described above with respect to FIGS. 40 through 42 and a relatively deep table top assembly 382. Here, table top assembly 382 has a configuration that is similar to table top assembly 14 described above except that table top assembly 382 has a depth dimension D4 that is equal to the combined depths of the table top assembly 14 and one of the exemplary trough members 16 described above. Thus, table top assembly 382 takes the place of one of the table top assemblies 14 and a trough member 16 between leg members 12b and 12c and adjacent channel assembly 18a. Although not illustrated, table assembly 382 includes all of the components described above with respect to FIG. 21 on an underside thereof and mounts to the support arm members 15 (see again FIG. 15) in a similar fashion to that described above with respect to table top assembly 14. In this case brackets 278 (see FIG. 26) would be located about midway along each lateral edge of top member so as to be positioned to receive shoulder members 620 formed by support arm members 15 (see again FIG. 12). Table top assembly 382 forms a scalloped edge opening 383 along a rear edge to allow power/data wires to pass there through down to a space there below. Thus, according to one aspect of the disclosed system, a kit of parts may be provided where addition parts can be added to an existing kit to add additional workstation or seating functionality. In addition, an existing configuration can be reconfigured to swap one furniture assembly for another furniture assembly while using a single core structure that includes leg assemblies 12a and 12b and a channel assembly 18. Any combinations of seating and workstation furniture assemblies may be constructed to fit requirements of specific applications. For instance, two lounge subassemblies 344 may be configured back-to-back, all workstation assemblies may include wide depth table top assemblies 382 (see again FIG. 43), etc. In addition to the components described above, at least some embodiments will include additional accessory components that can be attached to leg assemblies 12a, 12b, 12c, etc., via the slots and/or lips formed by the leg assembly rail members 24 and 26. For example, referring to FIG. 44, end table support brackets 390 (only one shown) may be provided for supporting a half-round table top 342 (see FIG. 39) or other type of end table via an upper rail slot 46 and lower rail lip 52. Exemplary bracket 390 includes a mounting plate 391 and an arm plate 393 that generally form a right angle. The mounting plate 391 includes a rearward and upward extending lip 392 along a top edge that is size and shaped similar to lip 190 in FIGS. 12 and 13 to be received in a rail slot 46. After lip 392 is received in slot 46, the lower portion of bracket 390 is rotated downward until a rear surface of plate 391 contacts an outer or external surface of side wall 397 of lower rail 26 so that arm member 393 is cantilevered from the leg assembly 12. In the illustrated embodiment, a locking hook 394 is provided through plate 391 that aligns with upward extending lip 52 on rail 26 where the locking hook 394 can be rotated causing the hook 394 to engage lip 52 and retain bracket 390 on leg assembly 12. Half-round top member 342 is mounted via screws or other mechanical fasteners to the top of arm member 393. As shown, the top surfaces of the half-round member 342, leg assembly 12a and top assembly 14 (see FIG. 39) are at the same height in at least some embodiments. Thus, the top surface of table top 342 and leg assembly top surface 28 form an extension of the worksurface 9 of top assembly 14. Referring again to FIG. 33, a casegood accessory 307 is shown mounted to a vertical side surface of leg assembly 12b so that a top surface 309 of accessory 307 is at the same height as the top surfaces of assemblies 14 and 14a. Referring also to FIG. 45, to mount a casegood accessory 307 to leg 12b, two brackets 407 (one shown) that mount to a side surface of accessory 307 and that form upwardly extending lips 409 akin to lip 190 in FIGS. 12 and 13 are provided. As shown, lips 409 are received in upper rail T-slot 46 to hang accessory 307 along the side of the leg assembly 12b. The bottom of bracket 407 forms an upwardly extending hook or lip member 652 that hooks on to a lower edge of one of the side walls that forms a casegood 307 (i.e., the bottom wall of casegood 307 is recessed). Top surface 309 provides an extension of the worksurface of top assemblies 14 and 14a as shown in FIG. 33. two nut and bolt pairs 650 (only one shown) are provided for each of the brackets 407. each nut and bolt pair includes a large head bolt and an associated nut. A threaded shaft of each bolt extends through aligned openings in bracket 407 and a side wall of casegood 307 and is received in the associated nut to secure casegood 307 to the brackets 407. In at least some embodiments the openings in bracket 407 and casegood 307 are aligned immediately adjacent a lower edge of lip member 50 formed by upper rail 24 so that lip 50 is sandwiched between facing surfaces of brackets 407 and the large head of bolt 650 so that the bolt head restricts rotation of casegood 307 about slot 46. Referring to FIG. 46, another exemplary accessory that may be provided for use with the configurations described above includes a shelf bracket 410. Here, bracket 410 has characteristics that are similar to the lounge bracket 346 described above except that the member 364 (see FIG. 41) is replaced by a larger shelf member 412 that does not form bolt passing holes. Exemplary shelf 410 is shown in FIG. 32 with an upwardly extending lip member received in a lower rail channel. While shelf bracket 410 is shown on an external surface of the leg assembly 12, it should be appreciated that the shelf bracket 410 may also be attached on an internal surface via an internal rail slot. Referring to FIG. 47, another exemplary accessory includes a purse or hook type accessory 420 that includes a vertical member 422, a horizontal shelf member 424, an end lip member 428 and an attaching lip member 426. Referring again to FIG. 32, the exemplary hook bracket 420 is shown attached to a slot formed by a lower leg assembly rail with the lip member 426 received within the slot. Referring once again to FIG. 33, in at least some embodiments, it is contemplated that where facing workstations are configured, station users may desire additional arch type structure for supporting computer display screens, additional storage space, etc. To this end, referring to FIG. 48, in at least some embodiments, an additional arch assembly 429 may be added to the configuration 300 described above. Arch assembly 429 includes vertical arch assemblies 430a and 430b that mount to and extend generally upwardly from leg assemblies 12a and 12b, an upper cross rail member 434 and an intermediate cross rail member 432. In FIG. 48, two display screens 436 are shown mounted to intermediate cross rail member 432. The rail members 432 and 434 mount to the vertical frame assemblies 430 and extend there between generally above a centrally located channel member 18. Referring to FIG. 49, an exemplary vertical arch assembly 430a includes first and second vertical members 440 and 441 as well as a top rail member 444 and an intermediate or lower rail member 442. The rail members 444 and 442 are formed of the same extruded rail stock that is used to form the leg assembly rail members 24 and 26. Vertical members 440 and 441 attach at lower ends to the top ends of vertical leg members 20 and 22. To this end, referring again to FIG. 6, an arch mounting threaded hole 88 is provided within vertical leg member 20 for attaching an arch mounting bracket 450. In addition, a web/lattice structure including a plurality of ribs 67, 71, 73 is formed within space 91 (see FIG. 6) that operates to guide or restrict placement of the lower end of bracket 450 (see phantom in FIG. 6) upon attachment. In addition to restricting placement, the ribs 67, 71, 73 cooperate with bracket 450 to increase rigidity in the connection between the leg assembly and the arch assembly and to limit side-to-side sway between the two assemblies. Referring also to FIG. 7, the leg assembly 12 cover 40 can be removed to gain access to hole 88. Referring to FIG. 50, a rigid metal bracket 451 and arch mounting screws 452 and 454 are provided. Bracket 451 mounts at one end via screw 452 to hole 88 (see again FIG. 6) where the lower end of bracket 450 is aligned with hole 88 via ribs 67, 71, 73. The top end of arch mounting bracket 450 passes through top slot 90 (see FIG. 6) and is inserted into a slot in the lower end of vertical member 440. Screw 454 is used to lock the bracket 450 to member 440. Next, a second cover member 456 that is designed for use when arch assembly is attached to the leg assembly 12 to close the space formed at the top of vertical leg member 20. FIG. 51 shows the arch/leg assembly connection in phantom. Referring again to FIG. 32 and also to FIG. 52, a shelf assembly 500 for providing an over trough shelf is shown mounted within channel 126 formed by channel assembly 18. Referring also to FIG. 9, pairs of mounting holes 670 (shown in phantom) are provided within the intermediate wall 127 of channel housing 110. In the illustrated example six hole pairs 670 are shown, three pairs adjacent each side wall of housing 110 where each three pairs include a left pair, a right pair and a center pair. Referring to FIG. 53, shelf assembly 500 includes a shelf member 502 and first and second brackets 504 and 506. Exemplary bracket 506 includes a foot member 512, a leg member 508 and an arm member 510 where the foot and arm members 512 and 510 extend from opposite ends of leg member 508 in the same direction and are perpendicular to leg member 58. Each of the foot and arm members 512 and 510 form mounting holes. Arm members 510 are longer than foot members 512. Shelf member 502 includes a top shelf surface and an undersurface. Referring to FIG. 52, a lower end of each bracket 504 and 506 is mounted via a bolt 522 to one of the mounting holes 670 inside channel 126 with leg members 508 extending up and out of the channel housing 110. A surface of leg member 508 facing housing 110 provides additional support to leg member 508. Arm members 510 extend over trough member 16 and shelf member 502 is mounted to arm members 510 as shown in FIGS. 32 and 52. While not shown, two or three shelf assemblies may be mounted over each trough member in a table configuration in a side-by-side manner. Referring now to FIG. 54, yet one other accessory that may be provided in some table configurations includes a space dividing or privacy screen assembly 540 that can be mounted to either end of any of the leg assemblies described above. Referring also to FIGS. 55 through 57 and FIG. 23, exemplary screen assembly 540 includes a screen member 542, a bolting bracket member 548 and a clip type bracket member 550. Screen member 542 can be formed of any rigid and generally planar material. Illustrated screen member 542 is generally rectangular with a lower corner cut out to form a horizontal intermediate edge 544 and an angled intermediate edge 546. The angle between edges 544 and 546 is identical to the angle between the top surface 28 of one of the leg assemblies 12a and the front surface 22 of the same leg assembly 12a (see FIG. 3) so that after being installed, screen member 542 generally conforms to the top and front surfaces of the leg assembly. Referring still to FIGS. 55-57, bolting bracket 548 is a metal strip that is secured via screws, adhesive or some other means to angled edge 546. Bracket 548 forms posts 560 that form threaded openings that are sized and arranged to be identical to the mounting structure on the inside surface of one of the cover members described above (see again FIG. 7) so that bracket 548 and the associated screen assembly can be mounted to one of the leg assemblies 12a after a corner member has been removed. Bracket 550 is an elongated rigid metal strip that includes two spring clip members 552 at one end. Clip members 552 are spaced apart a distance similar to the width of rail 24 (see again FIG. 23). Bracket 550 is screwed to, adhered to or otherwise attached to horizontal edge 544 of member 542 with clip members 552 extending downward therefrom at an end opposite the location of bolting bracket 548. In other embodiments members 548 and 550 may form a portion of a larger metal frame type screen structure. To secure assembly 540 to a leg assembly 12b, referring to FIG. 57, assembly 540 is aligned along a side of leg assembly 12b and is forced downward until clip members 552 contact edges of top surface 28 and are forced apart. Assembly 540 is forced further downward until distal ends of clip members are received within oppositely opening slots 30 and 46 in top rail 24 (see FIG. 23). Assembly 540 is slid along top surface 28 until bracket 548 is adjacent an outer surface 11 of leg assembly 12b and screws 562 are passed through openings 86 and are received in post 560 holes. Thus, screws 562 and clips 552 cooperate to secure screen assembly 540 to leg assembly 12b. While one way to secure a trough and a table top assembly to support arm members has been described above, other structure for accomplishing this task is also contemplated. To this end, an exemplary spring clip latching bracket 260 is shown in FIG. 58. Latching bracket 260 is an integrally formed resiliently flexible metal member that includes a mounting plate 262, a spring plate 264, a latch plate 266 and a handle member 271. Exemplary mounting plate 262 is rectilinear and forms two holes 268 for passing screws or bolts for mounting latching bracket 260 to trough member 16. Spring plate 264 extends from one of the long edges of mounting plate 262, is generally rectilinear and forms an obtuse angle with mounting plate 262. Latch plate 266 extends from one of the long edges of spring plate 264 opposite the edge that is attached to mounting plate 262 and generally has a triangular shape. A long edge opposite the edge attached to spring plate 264 forms a bearing edge 271. A short top edge of latch plate 266 forms a latch edge 270. Latch plate 270 generally extends from spring plate 264 in a direction opposite the direction in which mounting plate 262 extends. Handle member 273 is attached along an upper short edge of spring plate 264 and generally extends to the same side of spring plate 264 as does mounting plate 262. While spring plate 264 has a steady-state configuration as shown in FIG. 58, as the label implies, spring plate 264 can be resiliently deformed by temporarily bending as indicated by arrow 269. To this end, when a force is applied along edge 271, spring plate 264 tends to bend generally toward mounting plate 262. Similarly, when force is applied to handle member 273 tending to move member 273 toward plate member 262, spring plate 264 likewise moves towards member 262. Referring now to FIG. 59, an exemplary latching bracket 260 is shown mounted to an external surface of trough member 16 at one end of metal stringer member 251. As shown, latch plate 266 extends past an external surface of side wall member 231 and generally under a bottom surface of the trough lip member 220. Referring also to FIG. 14, the exemplary latching bracket shown in FIG. 59 is mounted generally at the location indicated by numeral 197. Although not shown in detail, a second latching bracket 260 is mounted at the second end 218 of trough member 16 in the area indicated by numeral 680 for interacting with the second arm support member 15 upon assembly. Where brackets 260 are mounted to a trough member 16, to secure the trough member 16 to a channel assembly 16 and support arm members 15, after the rear portion of lip member 220 is received in channel 148 (see FIG. 26 again), the front edge portion of trough member 16 is lowered until the bearing edges 271 of latching brackets 260 contact adjacent edges 200 of shelf members 180 (see again FIG. 12). As the trough member 16 is forced downward, edges 200 apply a force to bearing surfaces 271 causing spring plates 269 to temporarily deform until latch members 266 clear edges 200. Once members 266 clears edges 200, spring plates 269 springs back to their steady-state positions and members 184 are sandwiched between latch edges 313 and the undersurfaces 229 of the lip member 220. Bracket 260 in FIG. 58 can also be used as part of a different coupling assembly to mount table top assembly 14 to support arm members 15. To this end, referring to FIG. 60, an exemplary coupling assembly 280 includes a bracket 260a akin to bracket 260 illustrated in FIG. 58 and described above as well as a pin member 282. Like bracket 260 described above, bracket 260a includes a handle 273a, a latch edge 270a and a bearing edge 271a. Bracket 260a is mounted to strengthening runner 276 adjacent edge 451 with latch edge 270a generally facing the undersurface 270 of top member 279. In this embodiment a pin 282 is mounted to undersurface 270 and extends therefrom adjacent latching bracket 260a. Referring still to FIG. 60, again to FIG. 12, coupling assembly 280 components are mounted relative to each other such that, upon assembly of the configuration shown in FIG. 1, distal ends of the arm support members 15 are generally aligned with the coupling assemblies 280 and cooperate therewith to secure the table top member 279 to the support arm members 15. To this end, generally, as seen in FIG. 60, upon assembly, finger member 198 at the distal end of one of the support arm members 15 is received within slot 288 formed between edge 451 and the facing edge of finger member 286, pin 282 is received within hole 196 and shelf support member 184 is sandwiched between latch edge 270a and the undersurface 270 of the table top member. When so attached, the top member cannot be removed unless an assembly user affirmatively de-latches the latching bracket 260a by forcing handle member 273a into the unlatched position. To secure a table top assembly 14 that includes brackets 260a to the support arm members 15, as the front edge of the table assembly 14 is lowered, bearing edges 271a of brackets 260a contact edges 200 formed by arm members 15 (see again FIG. 12) and force is applied through the bearing surfaces 271a to the spring plates that form part of brackets 260a causing the spring plates to deform until the latch members of the brackets 260a clear edges 200. After the latch members clear edges 200, the spring plates spring back into their steady-state positions and members 284 are sandwiched between undersurface 270 of the top member and the latch edge 270a. While the invention may be susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and have been described in detail herein. However, it should be understood that the invention is not intended to be limited to the particular forms disclosed. For example, while the embodiments described above each include a channel assembly 18, it should be appreciated that at least some embodiments may include a rigid rail as opposed to a channel forming member where the rail is slidably mounted at opposite ends to facing leg assembly slots. In this case, separate wire management structure could be mounted to undersurface of table tops. As another example, the leg assemblies may form coupling or support surfaces other than lip members for channel/rail attachment in at least some embodiments. As still one other example, many other multiple person work station configurations can be constructed using the components described above. For example, referring now to FIG. 61, another configuration 580 is illustrated that includes three separate work station spaces. In configuration 580, the work stations all generally face in the same direction but they are staggered side-by-side. The components that are used to provide configuration 580 include all the components described above with respect to configuration 10 shown in FIG. 1 as well as other station subassemblies 10a and 10b. Subassembly 10a includes a third leg assembly 12c, a second table top assembly 14a, a second channel assembly 18a and a second trough member 16a. Similarly, subassembly 10b includes a fourth leg assembly 12d, a third table top assembly 14b, a third channel assembly 18b and a third trough member 16b. As shown, first channel assembly 18 is mounted at one end to a rear portion of leg assembly 12a and at the opposite end centrally to leg assembly 12b with trough member 16 and table top assembly 14 arranged to a forward side of channel assembly 18. Thus, while table top assembly 14 resided generally along one of the side surfaces of leg assembly 12a, table top assembly 14 is cantilevered generally to a front side of leg assembly 12b. Referring still to FIG. 61, similarly, second channel assembly 18a is mounted at one end to a rear portion of second leg assembly 12b and centrally to third leg assembly 12c so that second table top assembly 14a is positioned to one side of leg assembly 12b and is cantilevered generally in front of third leg assembly 12c. Channel assembly 18b is mounted at one end to a rear portion of third leg assembly 12c and centrally to fourth leg assembly 12d in a fashion similar to that described above with respect to channel assemblies 18 and 18a. Referring still to FIG. 61, the end result of attaching the components described above in the fashion described above is that the three work stations are staggered one from the other. In this configuration 580, channel assemblies 18, 18a and 18b are misaligned. Nevertheless, again, because each of the channel assemblies 18, 18a and 18b is open at its opposite ends and the channel assembly openings are open to the large leg assembly openings 38 (see again FIG. 1), power and data wires and cables can be routed from one channel assembly through the leg opening 38 to an adjacent one of the channel assemblies. Referring now to FIG. 62, one additional exemplary configuration 600 is illustrated that includes components for configuring three separate work stations. Here, adjacent work stations are staggered but face in opposite directions. To this end, exemplary configuration 600 includes one work station having all of the components described above with respect to configuration 10 shown in FIG. 1 as well as second and third work station subassemblies 10a and 10b. Subassembly 10a includes a third leg assembly 12c, a second channel assembly 18a, a second trough member 16a and a second table top assembly 14a while subassembly 10b includes a fourth leg assembly 12d, a third channel assembly 18b, a third trough member 16b and a third table top assembly 14b. Referring still to FIG. 62, first channel assembly 18 is mounted at one end to a rear portion of first leg assembly 12a and centrally to second leg assembly 12b with first trough member 16 and first table top assembly 14 mounted to a forward side of channel assembly 18. Second channel assembly 18a is centrally mounted to each of second leg assembly 12b and third leg assembly 12c with second trough member 16a and second table top assembly 14a mounted to a rearward side of assembly 18a. Third channel assembly 18b is centrally mounted to third leg assembly 12c and to a rear portion of fourth leg assembly 12d with third trough member 16b and third table top assembly 14b supported to a front side of channel assembly 18b. Thus, as shown, all of the channel assemblies 18, 18a, and 18b are aligned with the first and third work stations corresponding to table top assemblies 14 and 14b located to the front side of the channel assemblies and the second or middle work station corresponding to table top assembly 14a located rearward of the channel assemblies. One additional configuration 810 is shown in FIG. 63 that includes components to configure three pairs of face-to-face workstations 820, 830, 840 and two half-round end tables 850 and 860 supported by four leg assemblies 12a, 12b, 12c and 12d where all of the top surfaces of the table tops, end tables, leg members and channel assemblies are at the same height. In addition to the exemplary high vertical arch assembly 430a described above with respect to FIGS. 48-51, an intermediate arch assembly is also contemplated. To this end, referring now specifically to FIG. 64, another table/desk configuration 900 is illustrated that forms facing workspaces for two users where the configuration 900 includes one high vertical arch assembly 430a similar to the arch assemblies described above and one intermediate arch assembly 902. High assembly 430a is mounted to the top end of a first leg assembly 12a while intermediate arch assembly 902 is mounted to the top end of second leg assembly 12b. Although not shown in detail, here, intermediate arch assembly 902 would mount to the top end of leg assembly 12b in a fashion similar to that described above with respect to FIGS. 50 and 51 and therefore, in the interest of simplifying this explanation, the structure and manner for mounting intermediate arch assembly 902 to leg assembly 12b will not be described again here in detail. Structurally, intermediate arch assembly 902 includes first and second generally vertical members 904 and 906 that extend upwardly from leg assembly 12b and an intermediate height rail member 908 that extends between top ends of vertical members 904 and 906. Rail member 908 has a cross section similar to the cross section of rail member 24 described above with respect to FIG. 4 and therefore, among other things, forms T slots in each of its two lateral side surfaces akin to T slots 30 and 46 shown in FIG. 4 as well as a top flat surface labeled 909 in FIG. 64. In at least some embodiments, additional storage accessories may be provided for use with one or more of the configurations described above. One general type of particularly useful storage accessory is referred to generally as a gravity mount type accessory. Here, in general, as the label implies, gravity mount accessories are mounted to other configuration opponents via a gravity type interference fit connection. Many of the gravity mount type accessories can advantageously be mounted to other components without the use of tools and therefore are intuitive and easy to mount. To this end, referring again to FIG. 64, exemplary intermediate arch structure 902 includes first and second frame members 904 and 906 that form substantially oppositely facing surfaces 911 and 913 which form an angle such that a width dimension between the two surfaces 911 and 913 becomes greater when moving from top ends of the members 904 and 906 downward toward bottom ends. It has been recognized that surface 911 and 913 can be used as bearing surfaces to support storage units to be described hereafter. More specifically, storage units may be constructed that each include opposing bearing surfaces which define a length dimension which matches the width dimension between the oppositely facing bearing surfaces 911 and 913 so that when the storage unit is positioned with the top portion of arch structure 902 passing between the opposing bearing surfaces, the opposing bearing surfaces contact and are supported by the oppositely facing bearing surfaces 911 and 913 and the storage unit is supported by the arch assembly 902 in a useful position. Referring now to FIGS. 65-68, one exemplary gravity mount type storage assembly 912 is shown in the context of a table/desk configuration 910 that includes a single intermediate arch assembly 902 as described above with respect to FIG. 64. Here, storage assembly 912 is mounted to the top end of intermediate arch assembly 902 so as to afford storage space accessible on either side of arch assembly 902. Thus, persons using either of the facing work spaces defined by assembly 910 may use a portion of the space defined by storage assembly 912 to store office materials and/or space on the side of arch assembly 902 opposite the work spaces may be used to store office materials as well. Referring still to FIG. 65 and also to FIGS. 67 and 68, storage assembly 912 includes a case assembly 914 as well as a mounting insert of collar 916. Case assembly 914 includes four rectilinear rigid wall members that together form a box like storage space 926. The four wall members include a top member 918, a bottom member 920, a first side member 922 and a second side member 924. The top and bottom members 918 and 920 have similar rectilinear shapes and top member 918 is spaced above bottom member 920 so as to define the storage space 926 there between. In at least some embodiments, top member 918 will be spaced between 8 and 20 inches above bottom member 920 although other spacings are contemplated. Each of the top and bottom members 918-920 have a length dimension that is similar to a dimension C2 between oppositely facing edges of the tabletop members that form the workspaces defined by configuration 910 (see FIG. 65). Side members 922 and 924 are spaced apart at opposite ends of the top and bottom members 918 and 920 and traverse the distance there between thereby further defining the storage space 926. Referring specifically to FIG. 67, top member 918 forms a bottom surface 928 and bottom member 920 forms a bottom surface 930. Bottom member 920 forms an elongated rectilinear opening 940 that extends parallel to the length dimension of bottom member 920 and that is centrally located with respect to the dimensions of member 920. Opening 940 has dimensions such that at least a top portion of intermediate arch 902 (i.e., top portions of first and second frame members 904 and 906 in FIG. 64) can extend there through as will be described in more detail below. Bottom member 920 forms treaded mounting holes 942 at either end of opening 940. More specifically, two threaded mounting holes 942 are provided at either end of opening 940. Top member 918 also forms threaded mounting holes 942 in its undersurface 928. The holes 942 formed in bottom surface 928 are spaced relatively closer to each other than the holes 942 formed in bottom surface 930 such that the holes 942 in bottom surface 928 are vertically aligned with end portions of opening 940. Opening or rim 940 as a width dimension W1 and a length dimension (not labeled). The bottom surfaces 928 and 930 form a height dimension labeled H1 in FIG. 67. Referring now to FIG. 68, mounting insert 916 includes first and second mounting insert members 950a and 950b in the exemplary embodiment, each of members 950a and 950b is similarly constructed and operates in a similar fashion and therefore, in the interest of simplifying this explanation, only member 950a will be described here in detail. Member 950a is formed of rigid sheet metal that is bent to form integrally connected members including a central plate member 952, first and second end flanges 954 and 956 and four mounting tabs 958, 960, 962 and 964. Plate member 952 is a substantially rectilinear and rigid plate member having a height dimension H1 which is identical to the dimension labeled H1 in FIG. 67 between the bottom surfaces 928 and 930 of members 918 and 920, respectively. Plate member 952 as a length dimension similar to the length of opening 940 that extends between first and second end edges (not labeled). Flanges 954 and 956 extend in the same direction and are parallel to each other, extend from opposite ends of a plate member 952 and extend a dimension equal to approximately half the width dimension W1 of opening 940 (see again FIG. 67). Mounting tabs 958 and 962 extend toward each other from top ends of flanges 954 and 956 and along the top edge of plate member 952. Mounting tabs 960 and 964 extend away from each other from bottom ends of tabs 954 and 956. In at least some embodiments one or more additional mounting tabs 971 may be provided along the lower long edges of each of the central plates 952 (see exemplary tab 971 extending from mounting insert member 950b). Each of the mounting tabs 958, 960, 962 and 964 (and 971 if they exist) forms a mounting hole 970. The lower edges of flanges 954 and 956 define a dimension D4. Referring to FIG. 68 and also now to FIG. 66, the dimension D4 is substantially identical to a dimension D4 between oppositely facing bearing surfaces 911 and 913 of intermediate arch assembly 902 at a dimension H1 from the top surface 909 of arch assembly 902 where a dimension H1 is identical to the dimension H1 shown in FIGS. 67 and 68. Referring again to FIGS. 65, 67 and 68, to assemble storage assembly 912, the insert members 950a and 950b are positioned with their flanges 954 and 956 extending toward each other to form a flattened box-like subassembly. The subassembly is inserted through opening 940 with flanges 958 and 962 aligned with the threaded mounting holes 942 formed in undersurface 928 and tabs 960 and 964 aligned with the threaded mounting holes 942 formed in undersurface 930. Next, mounting screws 966 (see FIG. 68) are inserted through the tabs 958 through 964 and into the threaded mounting holes to secure insert 960 to case assembly 914. To mount case assembly 914 to intermediate arch 902, referring to FIG. 66, case assembly 914 is positioned above arch assembly 902 with the bottom opening formed by mounting insert 916 aligned with top surface 909 and the storage assembly 914 is lowered. Eventually, top surface 909 contacts the undersurface 928 of top member 918 between tabs 958 and 962 and intermediate arch 902 supports top member 918 and the other portions of storage assembly 912 attached thereto. In addition, in at least some embodiments, because dimension D4 formed by the opposing bearing surfaces at opposite ends of mounting insert 916 (see again FIG. 68) is similar or identical to the dimension D4 formed by oppositely facing bearing surfaces 911 and 913 of intermediate arch 902 at distances H1 (see FIGS. 66 and 67), the oppositely facing surfaces of arch 902 should contact the lower facing edges of the mounting insert 916 to provide additional support to the storage assembly 912 as well as to limit or eliminate any movement of the storage assembly 912 with respect to the supporting arch assembly 902. Additional gravity type storage assemblies are contemplated. To this end, referring to FIG. 69, a second exemplary gravity-type storage assembly 990 is shown mounted to an intermediate arch assembly 902 that forms part of another desk/table configuration 992. Referring also to FIG. 70, storage assembly 990 is similar to the assembly 912 described above in that it includes a case assembly 994 including top and bottom wall members or first and second shelf members 996 and 998, respectively, where the bottom wall member 998 forms an opening 1000 akin to opening 940 shown in FIG. 67. Here, however, storage assembly 990 does not include a mounting insert 916 and top wall member 996 forms a second mounting opening 1002 that is generally aligned above opening 1000. Opening 1000 has a length dimension D5 while opening 1002 as a length dimension D6 which is smaller than dimension D5. Dimensions D5 and D6 are similar to dimensions defined by different portions of the opposite facing lateral surfaces of the vertical members that form intermediate arch assembly 902 such that when storage assembly 990 is installed, each of the top and bottom members 996 and 998 form an interference fit with intermediate arch assembly 902. Thus, after installation, the storage assembly 990 is supported via an interference fit at each of four locations where end edges of openings 1000 and 1002 contact adjacent portions of intermediate arch assembly 902. As best shown in FIG. 69, after installation, and in at least some embodiments, the top surface 909 of intermediate arch assembly 902 should be flush with a top surface of top wall member 996. While not shown, it should be appreciated that the storage unit 990 of FIG. 69 may also be used with a high arch assembly 430a as in FIG. 64. In this case, the top portion of arch assembly 430a would extend up above unit 990 as unit 990 would slide down upon installation until an interference fit occurs. In at some embodiments gravity-type storage assemblies may also be provided for use with high vertical arch assemblies to mount storage accessories at higher levels with respect to work spaces there below. In addition, gravity-type storage assemblies may be provided that facilitate intermediate height storage even where the storage assemblies are mounted to high vertical arch assemblies. To this end, see FIG. 71 that shows a gravity-type storage assembly 1010 in the form of a metal collar which can be used to attach magnets or the like. Assembly 1010 is mounted at an intermediate height to a high vertical arch assembly 430a. Here, the collar 1010 is formed of bent sheet metal forming an internal channel and has internal length dimensions that mirror dimensions of the arch assembly 430a along a portion of the height of the arch assembly 430a such that the internal surface of the metal collar 1010 forms an interference fit with the arch assembly 430a at the intermediate height. Other collar embodiments may include different dimensions that cause the interference fit to occur at other heights with respect to the arch assembly 430a. Referring still to FIG. 71, yet another gravity-type storage assembly 1020 is illustrated that provides a storage space located to one side of the arch assembly 430a. To this end, the first and second frame members 904 and 906 include first and second oppositely facing side surfaces 1011 and 1013 and unit 1020 is designed to provide a storage capability to only the first side of the frame members. Storage assembly 1020 forms a rectilinear box 1024 and forms a collar 1022 to one side of the box 1024 and opposing bearing surfaces of the collar channel define a dimension that will cause an interference fit at a desired height with respect to the oppositely facing bearing surfaces 911 and 913 of the frame members that form the arch. Here, the opposing bearing surfaces form length dimensions that mirror width dimensions of arch assembly 430a along a relatively high portion of assembly 430a so that the interference fit between collar 1022 and assembly 430a occurs at a relatively higher location than the interference fit between collar 1010 and assembly 430a. As shown, assembly 1020 provides a storage box 1024 to a side of assembly 430a opposite work spaces. It should be appreciated that storage 1020 may simply be lifted from assembly 430a and re-installed with the box 1024 extending to the opposite side of assembly 430a if desired by work space users. Referring now to FIG. 72, yet another gravity-type storage assembly 1030 mounted to a high vertical arch assembly 430a is illustrated. Here, the assembly 1030 includes a collar 1032 for facilitating an interference fit with arch assembly 430a along a portion of the height of assembly 430a and includes first and second rigid shelf members 1034 and 1036. The shelf members 1034 and 1036 extend from opposite top edges of collar member 1032 to provide shelf surfaces to either side of arch assembly 430a. Referring now to FIG. 73, yet one additional gravity-type storage assembly 1040 is shown mounted to a high vertical arch assembly 430a. Here, storage assembly 1040 includes a collar 1042 having a storage box 1044 and 1046 located at each of the opposite ends of the collar 1042 to provide storage spaces that are essentially in line with the arch assembly 430a. Here, again, collar 1042 provides facing surfaces that define dimensions that are similar to the dimensions formed by the oppositely facing lateral surfaces of assembly 430a along at least a portion of the length thereof so that assembly 1040 forms an interference fit at a specific height with respect thereto. Thus, in general there are two different types of gravity storage units contemplated including ones like unit 912 in FIGS. 65 and 66 that include a top member having an undersurface which bears against a top rail of a frame member or arch and one like 990 in FIG. 69 where openings of a collar that form part of a storage unit include opposing bearing surfaces which bear against side surfaces of a frame structure that face in opposite directions. While two hook-type storage accessories are described above with respect to FIGS. 46 and 47, other hook-type accessories are contemplated including a board (e.g., snow, skate, etc.) assembly, a planter-type assembly and a bike-hanging assembly. In FIG. 74, an exemplary board storage assembly 1050 is shown mounted to the intermediate rail 442 of a high vertical arch assembly 430a. Referring also to FIGS. 75 and 76, board storage assembly 1050 includes a body member 1056 and a mounting bracket 1060 that is integrally formed with (e.g., welded to) body member 1056. Body member 1056 forms three board receiving channels collectively identified by numeral 1058 which angle upwardly when assembly 1050 is mounted for receiving boards (see phantom in FIG. 74). Mounting bracket 1060 includes a plate 1052 that forms a rearwardly and upwardly extending lip 1054 along the top edge thereof akin to the lip 362 shown in FIG. 41. As seen in FIG. 76, to mount assembly 1050 to the intermediate rail 442, lip 1054 is inserted into one of the side wall T-slots 46 of rail member 442 with a rear surface of plate member 1052 contacting a side surface 32 of rail 442. Referring now to FIG. 77, an exemplary planter assembly 1070 is shown mounted to the intermediate rail of a high vertical arch assembly 430a. Referring also to FIG. 38, assembly 1070 includes first and second mounting brackets 1072a and 1072b, a housing member 1074 and a planter insert 1076. Each of the brackets 1072a and 1072b is similarly constructed and therefore, in the interest of simplifying this explanation, only bracket 1072a will be described in detail. Referring to FIG. 79, mounting bracket 1072a is a rigid steel member. In at least some embodiments bracket 1072a includes a rectilinear plate member 1080 that forms an upwardly and rearwardly extending lip 1082 at a top end as well as an upwardly curling hook 1084 at a bottom end opposite the top end. Lip member 1082 is configured to be receivable within one of the T-slots (e.g., see 46 in FIG. 4 as well as in FIG. 76) formed by the intermediate rail 442. Housing member 1074 is formed of rigid bent sheet metal and includes a side wall 1086 that circumscribes an elongated planter space 1088 therein as well as a bottom wall 1090 (see FIG. 80). Bottom wall 90 forms first and second spaced apart slots 1092 and 1094 adjacent a rear wall portion of wall 1086 that are dimensioned to tightly receive hook members 1084 (see again FIG. 79) of mounting brackets 1072a and 1072b. Planter insert 1076 is a water tight insert that may be formed of plastic or any other type of suitable material. The insert 1076 is dimensioned to be received within the planter space 1088 formed by housing member 1074 and receive support therefrom. To mount the planter assembly 1070 to the intermediate rail 442, the brackets 1072a and 1072b are aligned with one of the intermediate rail T-slots (e.g., see 46 in FIG. 76) and are inserted there into so that the rear surfaces of the plates 1080 contact the side surface (e.g., 32 in FIG. 76) of the rail adjacent the T-slot and with the hooks 1084 extending vertically upward. Next, housing member slots 1092 and 1094 are aligned with the mounting bracket hook members 1084 and the housing member 1074 is forced downward so that the hook members 1084 are received within slots 1092 and 1094. Planter insert 1076 is inserted into the space 1088. Referring again to FIGS. 77, 78 and 80, in at least some embodiments slats 1092 and 1094 are spaced and positioned such that brackets 1072a and 1072b have to be positioned at the opposite ends of the T-slot formed by intermediate rail 442 in order to be received in slots 1092 and 1094. This limitation makes assembly more intuitive and also serves to center the planter assembly with respect to the supporting frame assembly as shown in FIG. 77. Referring now to FIG. 81, an exemplary bike mounting bracket 1100 is shown mounted to a top rail 444 of a high arch assembly 430a. Referring also to FIG. 82, the exemplary bike mounting bracket 1100 includes a rigid and integral bracket body member 1102 and a rubber insert 1112. Bracket body member 1102 includes a rigid metal plate member 1104 that forms a rearward and upward extending lip member 1110 along a top edge thereof. A shoulder member 1106 extends from a lateral edge of plate member 1104 and forms an essentially 90-degree angle therewith. An arm member 1108 extends from an edge of shoulder member 1106 opposite plate member 1104 and to the same side of shoulder member 1106 as does plate member 1104 where arm member 1108 is substantially parallel to plate member 1104 so as to form a generally horizontally extending hook (i.e., a hook that faces sideways as opposed to upward). Rubber insert 1112 is shaped generally like an internal surface formed by members 1104, 1106 and 1108 and can be press fit thereto to provide a soft surface for contacting the internal portion of a bike wheel rim as shown in phantom in FIG. 81. To mount the bike mounting bracket 1100 to top rail 444, lip 1110 is placed with one of the rail T-slots with a rear surface of plate member 1104 contacting an external surface of the rail below the slot as shown in FIG. 81. A bike wheel rim can be placed within the space between plate member 1104 and arm member 1102 with a bike extending down therefrom. As shown in FIG. 81, the rear wheel of the bike may contact a lower assembly rail to hold the bike in a cantilevered fashion to the side of the table/desk assembly. Referring now to FIG. 83, in at least some embodiments a bike track member 1120 may also be mounted to a high vertical rail assembly 430a for providing additional support for a bike. Referring also to FIG. 84, the exemplary track member 1120 includes an elongated rigid metal plate 1122 that should be long enough to accommodate both tires of a bike mounted thereto. In addition, at a top end of the plate 1122, a rearward and upward extending lip 1124 may be provided for interfacing with a top rail T-slot in a fashion similar to that described above with respect to other hook type accessory attachments. As shown in FIG. 84, in at least some embodiments, side flange members 1128 may be provided which extend from lateral edges of plate member 1122 along the entire length thereof to help maintain bike tires aligned with plate member 1122 when a bike is mounted using the bike track member 1120. Referring once again to FIG. 83, in at least some embodiments, the bike track member 1120 can be made more versatile by providing a series of mounting slots 1126 spaced apart along the length of member 1122. Additional mounting hooks 1130 may be provided that can mount to any one of the slots 1126 for hanging a helmet, a book bag, etc. An exemplary additional hook-type bracket 1130 is shown in FIG. 85. Bracket 1130 includes a hook forming member 1132 and a rearwardly and upwardly extending lip member 1134. Lip member 1134 is dimensioned to be received within any one of the slots 1126. In addition, in at least some embodiments, referring to FIGS. 82 and 85, lip member 1134 may have dimensions similar to lip member 1110 such that hook member 1130 can be mounted to either one of the slots 1126 formed by member 1120 or directly into one of the rail T-slots of the upper rail 444 or the intermediate rail 442 or either of the other two rails formed there below. Where bike member 1120 is used, the bike mounting bracket 1100 may mounted to any one of the slots 1126 also. In at least some embodiments, it is contemplated that a configuration user may want to mount one or more flat panel display monitors to one of the arch assemblies. To this end, an exemplary monitor 1200 is shown in FIG. 86 mounted to the intermediate rail of a high arch assembly 430a. Referring also to FIGS. 87 through 90, an exemplary monitor mounting assembly includes a rail mounting bracket 1202, a monitor mounting bracket 1204 and a plurality of mounting screws collectively identified by numeral 1206. Rail mounting bracket 1202 is an integral component formed of rigid bent sheet metal and includes a substantially square flat mounting plate 1208, a lower mounting flange 1212 and first and second lateral flanges 1218a and 1218b. Mounting plate 1208 is a rigid flat substantially square member having a top edge 1220, a bottom edge 1222 and first and second lateral edges 1224a and 1224b, respectively. An opening (not labeled) is formed near lower edge 1222 where the material from the opening is bent rearward to form a rearward and upwardly extending lip member 1210 (see specifically FIGS. 88 and 89). Here, the lip member 1210 is designed in a fashion similar to that described with regard to lip 362 shown in FIG. 41 so that the lip member 1210 can be received within one of the rail slots (e.g., see 46 in FIG. 88). Referring again to FIGS. 88 and 89, at lower edge 1222, mounting flange 1212 extends rearward in the same direction as lip member 1210. As shown in FIG. 88, the spacing between lip member 1210 and flange 1212 is such that, when lip member 1210 is received within one of the T-slots 46, flange 1212 is located just below one of the downwardly extending rail fingers 50. Flange 1212 is dimensioned such that it extends past the thickness of the finger member 50. Flange 1212 forms three holes including two threaded holes labeled 1214 and a central unthreaded hole 1216. Referring to FIGS. 87 through 89, lateral flanges 1218a and 1218b extend forward from the lateral edges 1224a and 1224b at approximately 45-degree angles outwardly. In at least some embodiments lateral flanges 1218a and 1218b extend between one-half and two inches depending on designer preference. Referring still to FIGS. 87 and 88, monitor mounting bracket 1204 is an integral bracket formed of bent sheet metal and includes a plate 1230, a mounting shoulder 1232, a mounting lip 1234, alignment tabs 1236a and 1236b (see also FIG. 90) and a lower mounting flange 1250. Plate 1230 is flat and substantially square having a top edge 1238, a bottom edge 1240, and first and second lateral edges 1242a and 1242b. Plate 1230 forms mounting holes 1244 in standard monitor mounting patterns that are used, along with mounting screws (not illustrated), to mount plate 1232 the rear surface of a monitor as well known in the art. Referring still to FIGS. 87 and 88, shoulder member 1232 extends rearward from top edge 1238 at an essentially right angle and mounting lip 1234 extends from an distal end of shoulder member 1232 downward and is substantially parallel with the rear surface with plate member 1230. Mounting lip 1234 has a length that is similar to the length of top edge 1220 of rail mounting bracket 1202. Alignment tabs 1236a and 1236b extend rearward from edges 1242a and 1242b. The tabs 1236a and 1236b are spaced apart such that they will contact a front surface of plate member 1202 immediately adjacent to lateral flanges 1218a and 1281b as best shown in FIG. 90 after installation. Thus, tabs 1236a and 1236b cooperate with the front facing surfaces of flanges 1218a and 1218b to laterally align the brackets during installation. Referring again to FIG. 88, lower mounting flange 1250 extends rearward along lower edge 1240 of plate member 1230. Monitor mounting bracket 1204 has a height dimension such that when shoulder member 1232 is received on the top edge 1220 of plate member 1202, lower flange 1250 can pass closely by lower flange 1212 of rail mounting bracket 1202. Lower flange 1250 forms a single threaded opening 1260 which aligns with opening 1216 (see again FIG. 89) formed by flange 1212 after installation. To use the brackets 1202 and 1204 to mount a monitor to the intermediate rail 442 (see again FIG. 88), screws are used to mount monitor mounting bracket 1204 to the rear surface of a monitor as known in the art. Next, rail mounting bracket 1202 is mounted to an intermediate rail 442 by moving lip member 1210 into the T-slot 46 and manipulating the bracket 1202 until lower mounting flange 1212 is positioned to extend below the rail 442. Next, two screws 1206 are threaded through the threaded openings 1214 in flange 1212 (see again FIG. 89) until the distal ends of the screws abut an undersurface of the rail 442 thereby locking bracket 1202 to rail 442. Continuing, with the monitor mounting bracket 1204 secured to the rear surface of a monitor, the monitor and mounting bracket subassembly is lifted in to a position such that the mounting lip 1234 is received on the rear side of member 1202 with shoulder member 1232 resting on the top edge 1220 of member 1202. The subsassembly is rotated such that mounting flange 1250 passes below mounting flange 1212 and therefore below rail 442 with tabs 1236a and 1236b contacting the front surface of member 1202 adjacent flanges 1218a and 1218b, respectively. Again, the sloped front surface of flanges 1281a and 1218b help guide distal ends of tabs 1236a and 1236b into positions such that bracket 1204 becomes optimally aligned with bracket 1202. At this point, threaded opening 1260 should be aligned with the central opening 1216 formed by flange 1212 and a single screw is threaded through opening 1260 and passes through opening 1216 and a distal end thereof contacts the undersurface of rail member 442 to lock the monitor mounting bracket 1204 to the rail mounting bracket 1202. The monitor is securely attached, as shown in FIG. 90, via the three screws 1206, to the intermediate rail 442. While the monitor 1200 is described above as mounted to an intermediate rail of an arch, it should be appreciated that all of the rails that form the leg assemblies 12a, 12b and arches have the same cross-section in at least some embodiments and therefore the mounting assembly may be used to mount a monitor to any of the frame rails. In addition, two mounting bracket assemblies could be used to mount two separate monitors to opposite sided of the same rail member via the oppositely opening T-slots. In addition, while flange 1212 in FIG. 89 is shown forming three openings 1214, 1214 and 1216, in some embodiments flange 1212 may only form the single central opening 1216 and locking may be accomplished via a single bolt passing through aligned openings 1260 and 1216 in a fashion similar to that described above. In still other embodiments it is contemplated that flange 1212 may be altogether eliminated and one or more bolts passing through flange 1250 (see again FIG. 88) may be used to secure both brackets 1204 and 1002 to a rail. Referring once again to FIGS. 40 through 42, while one type of lounge mounting assembly has been described above, other mounting assemblies are contemplated that, in at least come cases, may result in a more stable configuration. To this end, one exemplary other mounting subassembly is shown in FIGS. 91 through 93. Referring specifically to FIG. 91, the undersurface 1301 of a lounge subassembly 1300 is shown mounted to a leg 20 of one of the leg assemblies 12a. In this embodiment, the lounge subassembly 1300 forms a rigid downwardly extending lip member 1302 along each of its lateral ends (only one lip member 1302 shown). The lip member 1302 is used, in conjunction with the rackets shown in FIGS. 92 and 93, to secure the lounge subassembly 1300 in a relatively stable fashion. To this end, referring also to FIGS. 94 and 97, each of the leg members 20 that forms a part of a leg assembly 12a forms inwardly extending leg lips 1304. Referring again to FIGS. 91 through 93, the mounting subassembly components include a lounge bracket 1306 and a stabilizing bracket 1308. Lounge bracket 1306 is an integrally formed member including components bent out of rigid sheet metal. The bracket 1306 includes a substantially square rectilinear flat plate member 1310, the front flange member 1314 and a lower flange member 1316. A mounting lip member 1312 is formed along a portion of the top edge of plate member 1310 and is configured in a fashion similar to that described above with respect to FIG. 41 so that the lip member 1312 can be received within one of the rail T-slots. Front flange 1314 extends to the same side as lip member 1312 but from a front edge of plate member 1310 and serves the same function as flange 366 described above with respect to FIG. 41 and therefore will not be described again here in detail. Referring still to FIGS. 91 and 93, the lower flange 1316 extends from a lower edge of plate member 1310 to a side opposite the side on which front flange 1314 extends. Lower flange 1316 is bent to form an upwardly opening channel 1318 dimensioned to receive the downwardly extending lounge lip member 1302 (see also FIG. 91) upon assembly. Lower flange 1316 also forms a forwardly opening edge notch 1322 at a rear end thereof as well as an opening 1320 for passing a locking bolt 1322 (see again FIG. 91). Referring to FIGS. 91 and 92, stabilizing bracket 138 is an integral component formed of bent sheet metal or the like and includes a shoulder member 1330, an arm member 1332 and a finger member 1334. Shoulder member 1330 is a flat plate-like member that forms an opening 1340 for passing locking bolt 1350 (see FIG. 91). Arm member 1332 extends at a right angle from one edge of shoulder member 1330 and finger member 1334 extends from an edge of arm member 1332 opposite shoulder member 1330 in a direction opposite the direction in which member 1330 extends and is substantially parallel to member 1330. Along one side edge, finger member 1334 forms a first slot 1336 and along a second side edge that is opposite the first edge, finger member 1334 forms a second slot 1338. The slots 1336 and 1338 are dimensioned to be slightly larger than the thickness of one of the leg lips 1304 (see again FIG. 97) so as to be able to receive one of the leg lips 1304 therein upon assembly. To use the subassembly shown in FIGS. 91 through 93 to mount a lounge assembly 1300 between two leg assemblies 12a and 12b, lounge brackets 1306 are mounted to leg assemblies in the manner described above with respect to the bracket shown in FIG. 41. Next, the lounge assembly 1300 is positioned between the leg assemblies 12a and 12b above the lower flanges 1316 of the two brackets and is lowered until the lounge lip members 1302 (see again FIG. 91) are received within channels 1318. Referring to FIGS. 91 and 97, a separate stabilizing bracket 1308 is mounted to an undersurface of each of the lounge brackets 1306 via a locking bolt 1350 with an adjacent leg lip 1304 received within one of the slots 1336 or 1338 and the bolt 1350 is tightened thereby securely mounting the lounge bracket 1306 and lounge subassembly 1300 to the leg member 12a. Next, a thumb screw 1351 (see again FIG. 91) is placed through the edge notch 1322 and received in a threaded opening in undersurface 1301 of lounge subassembly 1300. Screw 1351 is tightened to further secure the components together. Another accessory that may be provided for use with some of the above described configurations includes a cover member that can be used in conjunction with one of the leg members 20 to provide at least some additional wire management capability. To this end, referring now to FIGS. 94 and 95, an exemplary wire management leg cover member 1362 includes an integrally formed rigid bent sheet metal member including a substantially rectilinear fascia member 1364 and first and second flanges 1366 and 1368 that extend at essentially right angles to the same side of fascia member 1364 and that are parallel to each other. The flanges 1366 and 1368 are somewhat flexible and are resilient and their oppositely facing surfaces form a dimension that is substantially equal to a dimension between the facing surfaces of the leg lip members 1304 (see FIG. 94). Thus, cover member 1362 can be installed within a substantially vertical channel 1360 formed by leg member 20 by flexing members 1366 and 1368 slightly inward and placing the cover member 1362 within the leg channel as shown in FIG. 94. In the illustrated embodiment, the fascia member 1364 and flange member 1368 form a cutout notch 1370 to ensure that regardless of the position of cover member 1362 within the channel 1360, there will be at least some opening for passing wires or cables from the bottom end of leg member 20 upward within the channel. As shown, cover member 1362 cooperates with leg member 20 to enclose space or channel 1360 for passing wires along the length of the leg member 20 in a concealed fashion. While some of the rail mounting brackets have been described above as simply coupling to a rail via a lip received in a rail T-slot (e.g., 46) without more, embodiments are contemplated that include additional engaging components which result in more secure locking functionality in the case of each of the brackets. For example, referring again to FIGS. 88 through 90, in at least some embodiments return flanges akin to the monitor mounting bracket flanges 1212, 1250 may be provided along a lower edge of any one of the board bracket 1052 (see FIG. 76), planter brackets 1072a (see FIGS. 78 and 79), bike bracket 1100 (see FIG. 82) or rail 1122 (see FIG. 83) where the return flange forms a threaded opening for receiving a locking thumb screw or bolt member. To this end, see the exemplary board bracket 1050a shown in FIG. 96 which is similar to the board bracket 1050 described above with respect to FIGS. 75 and 76 except that a return flange 1402 is provided. Referring now to FIG. 98, an exemplary long arch subassembly 1500 is illustrated which will be referred to hereinafter as “long arch” 1500. As the label implies, long arch 1500 includes a vertical arch assembly 1503 mounted to and extending upwardly from a leg assembly 1501 where leg assembly 1501 has a construction similar to leg assembly 12 described above and arch assembly 1503 has a construction similar to the construction of arch assembly 430a (see FIGS. 49 and 50) described above. The primary difference between leg assembly 1501 and leg assembly 12 is that leg assembly 1501 includes horizontal rails 1506 and 1508 that extend between substantially vertical leg members (not labeled) that are substantially longer than the horizontal rails included in assembly 12. Similarly, the primary difference between arch assembly 1503 and arch assembly 430a is the lengths of the horizontal rails where rails 1510 and 1512 are substantially longer than rails 442 and 444 (see again FIG. 49). In at least some embodiments the lengths of rails of assembly 1500 are between three and four times the lengths of similarly situated rails on assemblies 12 and 430a. Arch assembly 1503 mounts to leg assembly 1501 in a fashion similar to that described above with respect to assemblies 430a and 12 in FIG. 50. Referring to FIG. 99, an exemplary mid-height long support structure 1520 and an exemplary long leg 1522 are illustrated. The long support structure 1520 includes horizontal rails 1491,1492 and 1495 that have lengths similar to the lengths of rails 1506, 1508 and 1510 in FIG. 98 but has a height dimension that stops at a mid-level just above rail 1511 and therefore does not form a high arch as in FIG. 98. Long leg 1522 includes horizontal rails 1491 and 1493 that have lengths identical to the lengths of rails 1506 and 1508 but does not include other structure mounted to and extending upward above rail 1493. Referring to FIG. 100, an exemplary mid length arch 1530 and mid-length support structure 1532 are illustrated. Mid-length arch 1530 has a height similar to the height of assembly 1500 but includes rails 1507, 1509, 1511 and 1513 that have intermediate lengths that are generally longer than the lengths of the rails that form assemblies 12 and 430a but shorter than the lengths of the rails that form assemblies 1501 and 1503. For instance, the lengths of rails 1507, 1509, 1511 and 1513 may be mid-way between the lengths of the similar rails that form assemblies 12 and 430a and assemblies 1501 and 1503. Mid-length support structure 1532 includes rails 1507, 1509 and 1511 but does not include the structure extending above rail 1511 in FIG. 100. Although not illustrated, a mid-length leg assembly is also contemplated that would only include rails 1507 and 1509 in FIG. 100 and would have a length dimension similar to assembly 1532 shown in FIG. 100. Referring again to FIGS. 98-100, all of the rails 1506, 1058, 1010, 1512, 1491, 1493, 1495, 1507, 1509, 1511 and 1513 have similar cross-sections and each may be similar to the cross-sections of the rails described above that form part of the leg assembly 12. Another exemplary rail cross-section is shown at 1513b in FIG. 114 where the rail has a shape similar to the rails described above but where the side walls of the rail taper slightly inward from top to bottom below the rail portions that form side wall slots 1664. One or more of the long arches 1500, the long support structures 1520, the long legs 1522, the mid-length arches 1530, the mid-length support structures 1532 and the mid-length legs (not illustrated) can be cobbled together with other assembly components as described above and hereafter to configure many additional workspace configurations. For example, referring to FIGS. 101 and 103, an exemplary configuration 1538 that defines four workstations is illustrated that is configured using one long arch 1500, four short arches 1540a, 1540b, 1540c and 1540d and first through fourth table/wire management channel assemblies 1542a, 1542b, 1542c and 1542d, respectively, where each of the table/channel assemblies includes a table top subassembly 382 and channel member 18 as shown in FIG. 43. Referring specifically to FIG. 103, long arch 1500 includes first and second oppositely facing surfaces 1515 and 1517, respectively, and short arch 1540b also includes first and second oppositely facing side surfaces 1519 and 1521, respectively. Short arch 1540b is spaced apart from long arch 1500 with the first surfaces 1515 and 1519 substantially parallel and defining first and second planes, respectively, that define an assembly space 1489 generally to the side of long arch 1500 on which arch 1540b resides. The space 1489 includes front and rear portions adjacent opposite ends of the long arch 1500. Short arch 1540b is positioned within the rear portion of space 1489 so that one end thereof is generally aligned with one end of long arch 1500 and the other end of short arch 1540b extends only part way across the space 1489. In the illustrated embodiment short arch 1540b extends about one third of the way across space 1489. Referring still to FIGS. 101 and 103, short arch 1540d includes first and second oppositely facing side surfaces 1523 and 1525, respectively. Short arch 1540d is spaced apart from long arch 1500 with the first surfaces 1515 and 1523 substantially parallel and defining first and second planes, respectively, with the first side 1523 generally residing in the second plane defined by surface 1519. Short arch 1540d is positioned within the front portion of space 1489 so that one end thereof is generally aligned with the end of long arch 1500 opposite the end that is aligned with short arch 1540b and the other end of short arch 1540d extends only part way across the space 1489 toward short arch 1540b. In the illustrated embodiment short arch 1540d extends about one third of the way across space 1489. Referring to FIGS. 101 and 103, table/channel assembly 1542b is mounted between long arch 1500 and short arch 1540b to provide one workstation. Similarly, table/channel assembly 1542d is mounted between long arch 1500 and short arch 1542d to provide a second workstation. A space 1531 to the first side of long arch 1500 and between assemblies 1542b and 1542d is unobstructed after assembly. Two people may be located within space 1531 with backs generally to each other to use the two resulting workstations. Referring yet again to FIGS. 101 and 103, short arches 1540a and 1540c are spaced apart from short arches 1540b and 1540d, respectively, and are aligned with the rear and front portions of space 1489 as illustrated. Table/channel assemblies 1542a and 1542c are mounted between short arches 1540b and 1540a and between short arches 1540d and 1540c, respectively, to form third and fourth workstations, respectively. Again, the space 1531 between table/channel assemblies 1542a and 1542c is open and can be assumed by workstation users. Referring again to FIG. 86, another accessory type subassembly that may be used with any of the embodiments described herein includes a frame in-fill panel 1535. Exemplary panel 1535 is a two sided panel that has a shape that mirrors the shape of a space defined by one of the arch or leg assemblies that is to receive the panel 1535 and has a thickness dimension that, in at least some embodiments, is generally equal to the thickness of the members that form a leg, support structure, or arch assemblies. In other embodiments panel 1535 may have a thickness dimension that is less than or greater than the thickness of the members that form a receiving space. In FIG. 86, exemplary panel 1535 has a shape and dimensions that mirror the shape and dimensions of a space 1543 defined by rails 24 and 1541 and members 1537 and 1539. Thus, when panel 1535 is received in space 1543, panel 1535 fills space 1543 and forms a visual block and increases privacy for a user of an adjacent workstation. By filling several leg or arch defined spaces, the sense of privacy afforded by a work station configuration can be increased. In at least some embodiments panel 1535 may be very light weight and be formed by wrapping a fabric material around a foam board structure or by laminating several light weight layers of material together. In some embodiments a whiteboard material may form the outer surface of panel 1535 on one or both sides to provide a note and writing surface. In other embodiments other functional surfaces may be provided on panels such as a tack surface (e.g., cork), metal surface for use with magnets, etc. In still other embodiments one or all of the panels used with a configuration may be transparent or semi-transparent. In at least some embodiments panel 1535 will be dimensioned so that there is a friction fit between the edges of the panel 1535 and the members that form a receiving space 1543. The panel edges may be resiliently deformable so that panel 1535 can be deformed while installing and can then assume its relaxed state after installation. In other embodiments mechanical fasteners may be provided to secure panel 1535 in a receiving space. For instance, each panel may include a manually operated panel mounted lever that can be rotated to increase the friction between a panel and the space forming members after panel insertion into a space. In still other embodiments, referring still to FIG. 86, each panel 1535a may be formed by two separate panel halves 1551 and 1553 that can be brought together on either side of a receiving space where the halves have shapes and dimensions or lips 1555 that form shapes and dimensions that are slightly larger than the receiving space 1543 and where the halves connect to hold in place within the receiving space. For instance, two halves of a panel may include mating Velcro 1557 pieces that can secure the halves together where the lips 1555 sandwich the portions of the members that form a receiving space 1543. Velcro strips 1557 may be replaced by mating magnetic strips or some other type of mechanical fastener. In still other embodiments where the arch and leg assemblies are formed of steel or are at least partially formed of steel or some other material to which a magnet may attach, magnetic attachment of panels 1535 to the members that form the receiving space is contemplated. Here, magnetic strips 1569 (see again FIG. 86) or the like may be mounted on the edges of a panel 1535 to interact with facing surfaces of the space forming members. Referring again to FIG. 101, several panels 1535a, 1535b, 1535c, 1535d, 1535e, etc., are shown installed in receiving spaces formed by the arches. It should be appreciated that other assembly components described above can be used with the basic configuration described above with respect to FIGS. 101 and 103. For instance, in FIG. 101, one of the case goods subassemblies 307 (see also FIG. 45) is shown mounted to the bottom two rails of long arch 1500. In FIG. 102, the side of long arch 1500 opposite the side shown in FIG. 101 is illustrated. Configuration 1538 also includes a case goods subassembly 307 mounted to the second side of long arch 1500 as well as three flat panel display screens 1200a, 1200b and 1200c mounted to the mid-length rail of long arch 1500. Referring now to FIG. 104, the basic components of FIGS. 101 and 103 are shown rearranged slightly with some additional components added to configure a six person workstation configuration 1548. The main differences between configuration 1548 and configuration 1538 (see again FIG. 103) are that short arch assemblies 1540b and 1540a and short arch assemblies 1540d and 1540c have been moved laterally outward and fifth and sixth table top subassemblies 382a and 382b have been added which are supported at opposite ends by short arches 1540b and 1540a and by short arches 1540d and 1540c, respectively. Here, while four workstations are provided within the space to one side of large arch 1500, two additional stations are provided that extend out laterally from that space. Thus, referring again to FIGS. 103 and 104, it should be appreciated that a kit of parts including arches having different lengths can be reconfigured in many different ways to alter the number and arrangement of workstations as well as the accessories provided at each station. In addition, the long arch 1500 in particular provides a relatively large structure that can help define common areas (see FIG. 102) for use by more than one person at a time. Referring to FIG. 105, another workstation configuration 1558 is illustrated that is configured using three large arches 1500a, 1500b and 1500c, nine short arches 1540a, 1540b, etc., and eleven table/channel subassemblies 1542a, etc. As shown, in at least some embodiments, workstations can be formed to either side of any one of the large arches and the system components can be cobbled together to form a virtually endless number of different and useful configurations, depending on the needs of specific system users. Referring now to FIG. 106, another configuration 1560 is illustrated that includes one long arch 1500, a long intermediate height support structure 1520, one channel member 18, first and second table assemblies 382a and 382b and a plurality of in-fill panels (not labeled). Long arch 1500 and intermediate height assembly 1520 are spaced apart on opposite sides of an assembly space 1571 with channel member 18 mounted at opposite ends to central locations of rails of assemblies 1500 and 1520 and with table assemblies 382a and 382b mounted on opposite sides of channel member 18 to form two facing workstations of a central table structure between arch 1500 and support structure 1520. Both the front and rear portions of space 1571 are unobstructed by member 18 and table assemblies 382a and 382b. Configuration 1560 also includes two display screens 1200a and 1200b mounted to an intermediate height rail of long arch 1500 that face space 1571. An additional assembly, a counter assembly 1579, is mounted to the top rail of intermediate height support structure 1520 on a side opposite space 1571 for use by persons standing on the side of assembly 1520 opposite space 1571. Referring also to FIGS. 122 and 123, counter assembly 1579 includes a counter top member 1583 and a plurality (only one shown) of rigid metal (e.g., steel) brackets 1585 mounted to the bottom surface of member 1583 via mechanical fasteners 1591. Bracket 1585 has an L-shape in cross section (not shown) where one member of the L-shape contacts the undersurface of member 1583 and the other member of the L-shape extends downward there from to provide strength to the supported top member 1583. Mechanical fasteners pass through the portion of the bracket that contacts the undersurface of member 1583 and are received in threaded openings. Each bracket 1585 forms an upwardly extending lip member 1587 along a rear edge of member 1583 that is shaped and dimensioned to be received in any one of the side slots (e.g., 1589) formed by any one of the leg or arch assembly rails (e.g., 1581 in FIGS. 122 and 123). Although not shown in detail, in other embodiments bracket 1585 may be replaced by a larger bracket assembly like the one shown and described in FIG. 44 where the bracket extends downward to interface with a lower rail and provide additional cantilevered support. In addition, some type of locking mechanism (see 394 in FIG. 44) may also be provided to ensure that the bracket does not become inadvertently dislodged from the support rails. Referring to FIG. 107, another configuration 1570 is illustrated that is similar to configuration 1568 in FIG. 106, except that long support structure 1520 has been replaced by a simple short length leg assembly 12 and the accessories have been changed from displays and a counter assembly to two case goods assemblies 307a and 307b. Thus, configuration 1570 still includes long arch 1500, channel member 18 and first and second table assemblies 382a and 382b, respectively. Case goods assembly 307a is shown mounted to the intermediate height rail of long arch 1500 and case goods assembly 307b is mounted to the side of leg assembly 12a opposite table assemblies 382a and 382b. Configuration 1570 provides a large wall structure to one side of the table assemblies and is generally open to the other side. Referring to FIG. 108, another configuration 1590 is illustrated that includes one long intermediate height support assembly 1520 and one short leg assembly 12, one channel member 18 and one table assembly 382 and additional accessories including first and second counter assemblies 1579a and 1579b and a half round table assembly 342 (see again FIG. 39 for detail). Configuration 1590 may be suitable for use by a receptionist or the like where visitors may stand adjacent assembly 1579a while the receptionist uses the top surface of table top 382 or the top surface of half round member 342 to perform various work tasks. Referring to FIG. 109, another configuration 1600 is illustrated that includes one long arch 1500 and four short intermediate height support structures 1602a, 1602b, 1602c and 1602d as well as four table top assemblies, only one labeled 1612, four screen assemblies, only one labeled 1610, and four channel members, only one labeled 18. Intermediate height support structures 1602a and 1602c are spaced to one side of long arch 1500 and are separated there from so that they are aligned with front and rear portions of long arch 1500 while intermediate height support structures 1602b and 1602d are spaced to the other side of long arch 1500 and are separated there from so that they are aligned with front and rear portions of long arch 1500. Channel member 18 is mounted between long arch 1500 and support structure 1602a. In this embodiment, table top assembly 1612 is mounted to the top rail of intermediate height support structures 1602a and a rail of long arch 1500 at a similar height to provide a worksurface at a height flush with the top surfaces of the rails to which the top assembly 1612 is mounted. Screen assembly 1610 is mounted to channel member 18 and extends upward there from to a height adjacent the undersurface of table assembly 1612 to provide a modesty panel structure between channel member 18 and table top member 1612. The other three workstations that form part of configuration 1600 are constructed in a fashion similar to that described above with respect to components 1602a, 18, 1612 and 1610. Referring to FIGS. 124 through 128, screen assembly 1610 includes a screen member 1800, first and second pairs (only one illustrated) of mounting blocks 1802 and 1804 and a mounting bolt 1806 and a mounting nut 1808 for each pair of mounting blocks. Screen member 1800 is a rigid member that in at least some embodiments, is formed of bent sheet metal. Member 1800 includes a rectangular main member 1810, a shelf member 1812 and a mounting flange 1814. Shelf member 1812 extends at a right angle from a lower edge of main member 1810 to one side and flange 1814 extends at a right angle from an edge of shelf member 1812 opposite main member 1810 and in a direction opposite the direction in which main member 1810 extends. Flange 1814 forms a pair of mounting hole subsets 1816 and 1818 at opposite ends where each subset includes three separate holes. Referring to FIGS. 125 and 127, exemplary first mounting block 1802 is a rigid molded member that includes a top wall 1820, ends walls 1822 and 1824 and first and second side walls 1826 and 1828 that form a box like structure having a box shaped cavity 1830. Top wall 1820 is flush with first side wall 1826 and extends past the other side wall 1828 to form a lip 1832. First side wall 1826 forms three holes 1834 in a pattern that mirrors the pattern of one of the hole subsets (e.g., 1816) formed by flange 1814. Resilient tabs 1840 and 1842 are formed by second wall member 1828. Referring to FIGS. 126 and 127, second mounting block 1804 has a shape and construction similar to block 1802 and therefore will not be described here in detail. The one main difference between blocks 1802 and 1804 is that block 1804 includes two posts 1846 and 1848 that extend on opposite sides of single hole 1844 in a pattern that mirrors the holes 1834 formed by block 1802. Block 1804 also includes a top wall that forms a lip 1850, forms a cavity 1852 and forms flanges 1843 and 1845. To mount screen member 1800 to a channel member 18, screen member 1800 is mounted to block 1804 by aligning posts 1846 and 1848 with outer holes in hole subset 1816 and sliding block toward flange 1814 so posts 1846 and 1848 extend through the aligned holes. Block 1802 is then aligned with posts 1846 and 1848 on a side of flange 1814 opposite block 1802 and is slid toward flange 1814 until distal ends of posts 1846 and 1848 pass through block holes 1834. Bolt 1806 and nut 1808 are aligned with the central holes formed by blocks 1802 and 1804 and flange 1814 and the bolt shaft is passed through the aligned holes and nut 1808 is tightened to secure blocks 1802 and 1804 to flange 1814. The other block pair is mounted to flange 1814 at the other hole subset 1818 in a similar fashion. Once blocks 1802, 1804 are mounted to flange 1814, the combined width dimension of the assembly is such that tabs 1840, 1842 and 1843, 1845 that extend from opposite sides of the assembly form a friction fit with facing surfaces of channel member 18 upon being forced there into (see FIG. 128). Thus, assembly 1610 can be mounted to channel member 18. Referring now to FIG. 110, another configuration 1620 is illustrated that includes one table/channel assembly 18/382 mounted between one long arch 1500 and one short leg 12 with a half round assembly 342 mounted to the side of leg assembly 12 opposite table assembly 382. Here, assembly 1610 akin to assembly 1610 in FIG. 109 is provided which extends up from channel member 18 and provides some privacy to the area above table assembly 382. Counter assemblies 1579a and 1579b are mounted to the intermediate rail of long arch 1500 on opposite sides and one case goods assembly 307 is mounted under a portion of counter assembly 1579a to provide some storage for a user of configuration 1620. While configuration 1620 includes several panels (not labeled), a partial panel 1599 is provided that fills in only about half of a receiving space formed by the upper members of long arch 1500. The partial panel 1599 causes persons approaching a user of configuration 1620 to move toward the open space formed by long arch to communicate with the configuration user. Referring to FIG. 111, another configuration 1630 is illustrated that includes two intermediate length arches 1530a and 1530b that are connected together by spacer rails 1640, 1642 and 1644. Each of the spacer rails 1640, 1642 and 1644 is similarly constructed and operates in a similar fashion and therefore, in the interest of simplifying this explanation, only spacer rail 1640 will be described here in any detail. Referring also to FIGS. 112 through 115, rail 1640 has a cross section that is similar to the cross section of any one of the horizontal rails that form the leg assemblies or arch assemblies as described above. Spacer rail 1640 is mounted at opposite ends to top rails 1513a and 1513b of assemblies 1530a and 1530b, respectively, via brackets 1660. Exemplary bracket 1660 is a bent steel metal bracket that includes a generally flat base member 1670 (e.g., a base member shaped to follow the contour of the outer surface of adjacent rail 1650b and a shelf member 1672 that extends from a lower edge of base member 1670 and that forms a mounting hole 1674. Bracket 1660 forms an upwardly and rearward extending lip member 1676 that extends from the edge of base member 1670 opposite shelf member 1672. Lip member 1676 is sized and dimensioned to be received in one of the rail channels 1664 of the rail 1650b (see FIGS. 114 and 115) that spacer rail 1640 is to mount to. Shelf member 1672 supports rail member 1640 on a top surface (i.e., member 1672 is received in a lower channel formed by rail 1640) and a mechanical fastener 1672 (e.g., a finger tightenable bolt) is passed through hole 1764 and is received in a threaded opening (not illustrated) formed in the undersurface of rail 1640. A similar bracket is provided at the other end of rail 1640 to secure the other end to rail 1650a. After installation of the spacer rails 1640, 1642 and 1644, in-fill panels akin to those described above may be used to fill in the spaces between the rails to form a space dividing system as illustrated in FIG. 111. Although not illustrated, in at least some embodiments the bottom two rails 1642 and 1644 may be replaced by a long channel member akin to the channel members 18 described above. Where a channel member is provided as part of a wall configuration, the channel member can provide a wire management trough as well as power and data outlets if required for an application. Referring to FIG. 116, another configuration 1680 is illustrated that includes two long arches 1500a and 1500b that are spaced apart by spacer rail members 1640, 1642, 1644 and 1645. Configuration 1680 also includes two separate counter assemblies 1579a and 1579b, each mounted to a different one of the intermediate rails of the long arches 1500a and 1500b, where the counter assemblies 1579a and 1579b extend in opposite directions. Configuration 1680 further includes third and fourth counter assemblies 1579c and 1579d that are mounted to opposite sides of intermediate height spacer rail 1645 so that the top surfaces of the countertop members included in assemblies 1579c and 1579d are at the same height as the top surfaces of the top members that are included in countertop assemblies 1579a and 1579b. In this manner a configuration is provided that provides worksurfaces for standing users. One case good 307 is shown mounted to the spacer rails 1642 and 1644. Thus, because the spacer rails have cross sections that are similar to the cross sections of the leg and arch rail members, any of the accessories described above can be mounted to any one of the spacer rails. Referring now to FIG. 117, another configuration 1709 is illustrated that includes three short length arches 1540a, 1540b and 1540c, two short leg assemblies 12a and 12b, and table and channel assemblies (not labeled) that space the leg and arch assemblies apart to form four single or double workstations, depending on the number (e.g., 1 or 2) of table assemblies mounted between adjacent arch and leg assemblies. In the illustrated embodiment, the arch assemblies are between the leg assemblies. Configuration 1709 also includes overhead structure that can further enhance a feeling of space within an open environment and that can be used to provide additional functionality. To this end, the exemplary overhead structure shown in FIG. 117 includes three canopy subassemblies 1700a, 1700b and 1700c that are mounted to the top surfaces of arch assemblies 1540a, 1540b and 1540c. Each canopy extends to either side of the arch to which it is mounted and generally extends about half way to each adjacent arch in either direction. Each canopy has a length dimension that extends perpendicular to a supporting arch that is similar to (e.g., slightly smaller than) the length of one of the table top members that is included in one of the table assemblies therebelow. Thus, when two adjacent arches support two canopy assemblies, adjacent edges of the adjacent canopies are near each other (e.g., may form a 1-2 inch gap) so that an enclosed ceiling feeling results. Referring also to FIGS. 118 and 119, exemplary canopy assembly 1700a includes a rigid and generally rectangular frame assembly 1720, a canopy cover member 1724, mechanical fasteners 1744 for fastening the assembly to the top end of one of the arches, and some features or characteristics that enable fastening of cover 1724 to frame 1720. In the illustrated embodiment, referring also to FIG. 120, frame assembly 1720 includes elongated members 1748 and four corner members 1750 formed of metal or plastic that form the rectangular shape. A central mounting member 1722 extends between central portions of the elongated members 1748 and bends downward at a central portion to form a generally flat mounting plate which in turn forms mounting holes (not labeled) for passing mechanical fasteners 1744. Edges of the frame are rounded or curved so that after cover 1724 is installed, the cover surface appears to be curved and generally smooth. Each elongated member 1748 forms a channel 1769 along its length (see again FIG. 120) Cover 1724 is typically formed of a resilient fabric material which can deform when pulled over the frame 1720 so that the cover can conform to a shape when stretched over the frame. It the illustrated embodiment a resilient rubber gasket 1734 is provided which is formed to fit snugly within channel 1769 after an edge of the fabric cover 1724 is inserted into the channel 1769. To install cover 1724 on frame 1720, frame 1720 is placed on one side of the cover and lateral edges of the cover are pulled up and over the outer surfaces of the frame and are tucked into the channel 1769 where they are secured via insertion of the gasket 1734. During the stretching process, cover 1724 forms generally curved surfaces and the end product has an aesthetically appealing look. After cover 1724 is installed on a frame 1720, the subassembly can be mounted to a supporting arch by placing the subassembly with the bottom surface of plate 1723 facing a top surface of the arch and using fasteners 1744 to fasten the subassembly to the top of the arch (e.g., via threaded holes in the top rail of the arch assembly. Referring again to FIG. 120, in the alternative, strips of J-hook material (e.g., plastic) 1900 may be sewn on to the edges of cover member 1724 and coupled to flanges 1902 formed by elongated members 1748 to stretch cover 1724 across structure 1720 and to secure cover 1724 to members 1748. Referring again to FIG. 119, in some embodiments a sound deadening material 1736 such as a foam layer may be placed within the space form by canopy 1700a to reduce sound travel between adjacent workstations. In addition to enhancing the sense of an enclosed space, canopies 1700a, 1700b, 1700c, etc., also provide an overhead space that can be used to locate audio equipment such as microphones and speakers. To this end, see component 1730 in FIG. 118 that is mounted to a top surface of member 1723 in the space defined by the stretched top surface of cover member 1724. In at least some embodiments component 1730 may include audio equipment for generating sound for various purposes (e.g., music, videoconferencing sound, etc.). Referring to FIG. 121, in some cases a lighting device 1770 may be mounted to member 1722 that directs light down on to the top surface of cover 1724. Device 1770 may include components such as a string of LEDs or fluorescent lighting to cause the fabric of the cover to appear to glow from an underside thereof. In this case, the fabric cover may be formed of a material that is semitransparent or that is only somewhat opaque, depending on the effect sought by a designer. In some cases cover 1724 is formed of an elastomeric white material (e.g., stretch fabric) which tends to glow when viewed from a lower vantage point when light is shined on the top surface. In some embodiments the fabric used to form the cover 1724 may be a fabric that can glow when powered so that a completely uniform lighting surface (e.g., an emissive surface) on the undersurface of cover 1724 results. In still other embodiments light may be shone onto either the top or the undersurface of cover 1724 using lighting devices located outside the space defined by the canopy assembly. For instance, referring again to FIG. 117, area lights 1714 above canopy assembly 1700c are shown shining light onto the top surface of assembly 1700c to cause the cover material to glow from below and to light the space adjacent two workstation areas. As another instance, a small light 1712 is shown mounted to the top rail of arch assembly 1540b where the small light directs light upward at an undersurface of the cover and the light is reflected at least in part off the undersurface and back into a workspace area. As still one other instance, a small light device 1710 is shown mounted to the intermediate height rail of arch assembly 1540a where the light device shines light up on the undersurface of an adjacent canopy cover. Each of the light devices 1710 and 1712 may be mounted via a lip member akin to lip member 1671 (see again FIG. 114) to one of the slots formed by any of the arch rails described above. Other lighting configurations and features are contemplated for generating light in conjunction with a canopy assembly. While generally rectangular canopies are shown in FIGS. 117-119 and 121, other shapes are contemplated such as, for instance, round, square, rhomboids, parallelograms, etc. Referring now to FIG. 129, one additional accessory includes an arch shade assembly 2000 that may be mounted between two arch assemblies 2100a and 2100b on opposite sides of a channel/table subassembly 18/382 to afford additional privacy to a workstation user. Referring also to FIG. 130, exemplary shade assembly 2000 includes three rigid elongated tubes 2002, 2004 and 2006 that mount to rails of spaced apart arch assemblies 2100a and 2100b as well as a fabric shade member 2010. A pair of dual tube brackets 2014 are provided for mounting tubes 2002 and 2004 between the top rails 2112 and 2114 of assemblies 2100a and 2100b and a pair of single tube brackets 2015 are provided to mount tube 2006 between intermediate arch rails 2116 and 2118. Referring to FIGS. 130 and 131, each bracket 2014 includes an upwardly extending lip 2020 that is receivable in rail slot 2022 and has a length dimension similar to the length of the slot 2022. Each bracket 2014 forms two mounting posts 2024 and 2025 that extend in the same direction adjacent opposite ends of bracket 2014. A spring loaded pin 2026 is mounted to each post and has a distal end that extends perpendicular to the post length. Each tube 2002 and 2004 is an elongated rigid tube that forms pin receiving holes 2030 adjacent each end. To mount tubes 2002 and 2004 to rail 2114, lip 2020 is placed within slot 2022 and tubes 2002 and 2004 are slid on to posts 2024 and 2026, respectively, until pins 2026 are received in holes 2030. Referring to FIG. 130, each single tube bracket 2015 has a construction similar to the construction of bracket 2014 except that the bracket length is shorter and the bracket 2015 only includes a single post and pin subassembly. In use, brackets 2015 are mounted at rear ends of intermediate rails 2116 and 2118. Shade member 2010 is a fabric member that has a front edge secured to tube 2004, a rear edge that may be connected to channel forming member 18 (e.g., via a sewn on J-hook strip akin to strip 1900 shown in FIG. 120) and intermediate portions adjacent and supported by tubes 2002 and 2006. The fabric used to form member 2010 may be opaque or, in some cases, translucent or partially transparent. The front edge of cover 2010 may be sewn in a loop and tube 2004 may pass through the loop prior to attachment to the brackets 2014. In the alternative fasteners such as ties, Velcro® connectors, snaps, etc., may be secured to the cover edge for connection. In at least some embodiments it is contemplated that tube 2004 may be replaced by a roll screen akin to the types of screens used to cover windows so that the cover 2010 may be optionally retracted when less privacy is required.
