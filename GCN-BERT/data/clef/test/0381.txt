CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims benefit from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/952,731, filed Mar. 13, 2014, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention is directed to a method of treating alcohol dependence, including acute and post-acute withdrawal symptoms, comprising treating an alcohol dependent patient with noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof at a dosage that provides an average serum concentration of about 50 ng/mL to about 850 ng/mL, including under conditions where the QT interval prolongation does not exceed about 50 milliseconds. STATE OF THE ART Noribogaine is sometimes referred to as 12-hydroxyibogaine. U.S. Pat. No. 2,813,873 claims noribogaine albeit as “12-O-demethylibogaine” while providing an incorrect structural formula for ibogaine. Noribogaine can be depicted by the following formula: Noribogaine and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts have recently received significant attention as a non-addictive alkaloid useful in treating drug dependency (U.S. Pat. No. 6,348,456) and as a potent analgesic (U.S. Pat. No. 7,220,737). Such treatment generally requires administration of high doses of noribogaine, typically 0.1 mg to 100 mg per kg body weight. Noribogaine is a metabolite of ibogaine found in human, dog, rat and monkey. While the prior art suggests that ibogaine at higher doses is useful as a treatment for addiction, use of ibogaine is associated with hallucinations and other negative side effects. In the United States, ibogaine is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. Noribogaine has been suggested to have a greater and longer lasting activity in humans than ibogaine for reducing craving for addictive substances and treating chemical dependency. U.S. Pat. No. 6,348,456, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, discloses highly purified noribogaine and teaches that it should be provided at dosages from about 0.01 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day to treat addiction, although no human data was provided showing an effective dose to treat drug addiction. Alcohol dependence (also referred to alcohol abuse, alcohol addiction, or alcoholism) is a serious public health problem throughout the world. As many as 140 million people worldwide have an alcohol abuse problem, although only a small fraction of those receive treatment. Alcohol abuse can cause damage to almost every organ in the body, including the brain. Long-term alcohol abuse is known to cause or contribute to numerous diseases, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, dementia, heart disease, peptic ulcers, damage to the central and/or peripheral nervous system, cancer, polyneuropathy, nutritional deficiencies, and death. Complicating the treatment of alcohol dependence, alcohol-dependent patients generally experience significant, potentially fatal, withdrawal symptoms while attempting to quit using alcohol. Acute withdrawal lasts one to three weeks after cessation of alcohol consumption. Acute withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes, and heart failure. Post-acute withdrawal can last significantly longer, with symptoms such as anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, fatigue, and tension being common. Treatment for alcohol dependence generally includes detoxification followed by individual and/or group therapy. Detoxification may include treatment with medications (such as benzodiazepines) that reduce the symptoms of withdrawal. However, drugs such as benzodiazepines have numerous negative side effects, including adverse psychological effects and physical dependence. Benzodiazepines are also known to increase alcohol cravings in alcohol dependent people, and are thus not suitable for long-term treatment of alcohol dependence/addiction. Due to the severity and duration of withdrawal symptoms, alcohol-dependent patients have a high rate of relapse. There is a significant need for effective, non-addictive treatment for acute and post-acute withdrawal symptoms, as well as a method for preventing relapse to alcohol use by a detoxified patient. Alcohol consumption has been shown to stimulate the release of endogenous opioids in the brains of both humans and experimental animals. Alcohol's effects on the opioid system are believed to be central to drug-induced reward and relapse to alcohol use, as well as sensitivity to alcohol. While the prior art suggests that ibogaine at higher doses is useful as a treatment for alcohol dependence, use of ibogaine is associated with hallucinations and other negative side effects. In the United States, ibogaine is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. Noribogaine is a metabolite of ibogaine found in human, dog, rat and monkey. The therapeutic dosing of noribogaine for treating alcohol dependence in humans has not previously been addressed, especially as it relates to dosing protocols that are effective, as well as safe. Indeed, prior to the instant invention, it was uncertain as to whether noribogaine could be administered at a dose which was therapeutic while at the same time safe for patients. SUMMARY While noribogaine has been disclosed for treatment of alcohol dependence, its use in humans is complicated by the fact that the ranges in the prior art are exceptionally broad (0.01 to 1000 mg/kg body weight). Furthermore, human clinical studies demonstrate that the lower dosing of noribogaine has minimal impact on withdrawal symptoms in addicted patients. Thus, the previously disclosed broad range has now been found to be insufficient for human therapy at the lower end of this range. Moreover, the use of noribogaine imparts a dose-dependent prolongation of the treated patient's QT interval, rendering higher dosing of noribogaine unacceptable. A prolonged QT interval is a marker of potential Torsades de Pointes, a serious arrhythmia that can result in death. For reasons that are not apparent, this prolongation increases in opioid addicted patients as compared to healthy individuals. The current invention is predicated, in part, on the surprising discovery that treatment with a narrow dosage range of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof, between greater than about 1 mg/kg body weight and about 8 mg/kg body weight, provides a therapeutic reduction in withdrawal symptoms in alcohol dependent patients. Preferably, the dose range that provide both therapeutic results and an acceptable QT interval prolongation of less than 50 milliseconds in addicted humans is between about 1.3 mg per kg body weight and no more than about 4 mg per kg body weight and, more preferably between about 1.3 mg per kg body weight and no more than about 3 mg per kg body weight, or any subrange or subvalue within the aforementioned ranges. In a preferred embodiment, the narrow therapeutic doses of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate described above do not prolong the QT interval to unacceptable levels in human patients. It is expected that alcohol dependent patients will be administered therapeutic doses of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof in a clinical setting with cardiac monitoring. In some embodiments, the patient will be pre-screened to evaluate tolerance for prolongation of QT interval, e.g., to determine whether the patient has any pre-existing cardiac conditions or other indicators which would disqualify them from treatment with noribogaine. In one embodiment, a patient who exhibits a QT interval prolongation of less than about 20 ms after treatment with one or more therapeutic doses of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof will not require further clinical monitoring. Some aspects of the current invention are further predicated on the discovery that even lower doses of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof, for example approximately 80% or less of the therapeutic dose, may be effective for prevention of relapse of alcohol use in an addicted patient treated to ameliorate their alcohol dependence. That is, a lower dose of noribogaine can prevent a patient who is no longer physically dependent on alcohol from relapsing to use thereof. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that a patient who is no longer physically dependent on alcohol requires less noribogaine to prevent relapse at least in part because the changes made to the brain by alcohol dependence at least partially reverse when the patient detoxifies from alcohol. This lower, maintenance dose of noribogaine results in a QT interval prolongation that does not require clinical cardiac monitoring. In some embodiments, the therapeutic dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof administered to the patient is sufficient to provide an average serum concentration of about 50 ng/mL to about 850 ng/mL, or any subrange or subvalue there between. In a preferred embodiment, the dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof administered to the patient provides an average serum concentration of about 50 ng/mL to about 400 ng/mL. In some embodiments, the patient is administered a high (therapeutic) dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof for a period of time to ameliorate the most significant withdraw symptoms, and then is administered a lower (maintenance) dose to prevent relapse to alcohol use. In some embodiments, the patient is administered a therapeutic dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof for a period of time to ameliorate the most significant withdraw symptoms, and then is administered a decreasing (tapered) amount of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof over time until the maintenance dose is reached. In some embodiments, a high initial therapeutic dose is administered, followed by administration of a lower therapeutic dose. In some embodiments, the dose of noribogaine is tapered over time from the high therapeutic dose to a lower therapeutic dose. In some embodiments, the dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof that provides an average serum concentration of about 50 ng/mL to about 850 ng/mL is administered as a single dose. In some embodiments, the dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof that provides an average serum concentration of about 50 ng/mL to about 850 ng/mL is administered as multiple doses. In some embodiments, the aggregate dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is from greater than about 1 mg/kg to about 8 mg/kg. In a preferred embodiment, the aggregate dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is from greater than about 1 mg/kg to about 4 mg/kg. In another preferred embodiment, the aggregate dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof is from greater than about 1 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg. In some embodiments, the serum concentration of noribogaine is sufficient to inhibit or ameliorate said dependence while maintaining a QT interval of less than 500 milliseconds (ms) during said treatment. In some embodiments, the therapeutic dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 80 ms. In one embodiment, the maintenance dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 50 ms. In some embodiments, the maintenance dose or therapeutic dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 30 ms. In a preferred embodiment, the maintenance dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof provides prolongation of the QT interval of less than 20 ms. In a preferred embodiment, the patient is tested to determine QT interval before treatment with noribogaine, and if clinician determines that the QT prolongation would be unacceptable risk, noribogaine therapy will be contraindicated.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION It is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular embodiments described, as such may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of this invention will be limited only by the appended claims. The detailed description of the invention is divided into various sections only for the reader's convenience and disclosure found in any section may be combined with that in another section. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It must be noted that as used herein and in the appended claims, the singular forms “a”, “an”, and “the” include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “a compound” includes a plurality of compounds. I. Definitions Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. As used herein the following terms have the following meanings. The term “about” when used before a numerical designation, e.g., temperature, time, amount, concentration, and such other, including a range, indicates approximations which may vary by (+) or (−) 20%, 10%, 5%, 1%, or any subrange or subvalue there between. Preferably, the term “about” when used with regard to a dose amount means that the dose may vary by +/−20%. For example, “about 2 mg/kg noribogaine” indicates that a patient may be administered a dose of noribogaine between 1.6 mg/kg and 2.4 mg/kg. In another example, about 120 mg per unit dose of noribogaine indicates that the unit dose may range from 96 mg to 144 mg. “Administration” refers to introducing an agent, such as noribogaine, into a patient. Typically, an effective amount is administered, which amount can be determined by the treating physician or the like. Any route of administration, such as oral, topical, subcutaneous, peritoneal, intra-arterial, inhalation, vaginal, rectal, nasal, introduction into the cerebrospinal fluid, or instillation into body compartments can be used. The agent, such as noribogaine, may be administered by direct blood stream delivery, e.g. sublingual, buccal, intranasal, or intrapulmonary administration. The related terms and phrases “administering” and “administration of”, when used in connection with a compound or pharmaceutical composition (and grammatical equivalents) refer both to direct administration, which may be administration to a patient by a medical professional or by self-administration by the patient, and/or to indirect administration, which may be the act of prescribing a drug. For example, a physician who instructs a patient to self-administer a drug and/or provides a patient with a prescription for a drug is administering the drug to the patient. “Periodic administration” or “periodically administering” refers to multiple treatments that occur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Periodic administration may also refer to administration of an agent, such as noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or salt and/or solvate thereof one, two, three, or more times per day. Administration may be via transdermal patch, gum, lozenge, sublingual tablet, intranasal, intrapulmonary, oral administration, or other administration. “Comprising” or “comprises” is intended to mean that the compositions and methods include the recited elements, but not excluding others. “Consisting essentially of” when used to define compositions and methods, shall mean excluding other elements of any essential significance to the combination for the stated purpose. Thus, a composition consisting essentially of the elements as defined herein would not exclude other materials or steps that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s) of the claimed invention. “Consisting of” shall mean excluding more than trace elements of other ingredients and substantial method steps. Embodiments defined by each of these transition terms are within the scope of this invention.

No. 13/593,454, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. “Noribogaine derivatives” refer, without limitation, to esters or O-carbamates of noribogaine, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or solvates of each thereof. Also encompassed within this invention are derivatives of noribogaine that act as prodrug forms of noribogaine. A prodrug is a pharmacological substance administered in an inactive (or significantly less active) form. Once administered, the prodrug is metabolized in vivo into an active metabolite. Noribogaine derivatives include, without limitation, those compounds set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,348,456 and 8,362,007; as well as in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/165,626; and US Patent Application Publication Nos. US2013/0131046; US2013/0165647; US2013/0165425; and US2013/0165414; all of which are incorporated herein by reference. Non-limiting examples of noribogaine derivatives encompassed by this invention are given in more detail in the “Compositions” section below. In some embodiments, the methods of the present disclosure entail the administration of a prodrug of noribogaine that provides the desired maximum serum concentrations and efficacious average noribogaine serum levels. A prodrug of noribogaine refers to a compound that metabolizes, in vivo, to noribogaine. In some embodiments, the prodrug is selected to be readily cleavable either by a cleavable linking arm or by cleavage of the prodrug entity that binds to noribogaine such that noribogaine is generated in vivo. In one preferred embodiment, the prodrug moiety is selected to facilitate binding to the μ and/or κ receptors in the brain either by facilitating passage across the blood brain barrier or by targeting brain receptors other than the μ, and/or κ receptors. Examples of prodrugs of noribogaine are provided in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/165,626, the entire content of which is incorporated herein by reference. This invention is not limited to any particular chemical form of noribogaine or a noribogaine derivative, and the drug may be given to patients either as a free base, solvate, or as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. In the latter case, the hydrochloride salt is generally preferred, but other salts derived from organic or inorganic acids may also be used. Examples of such acids include, without limitation, those described below as “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” and the like. “Pharmaceutically acceptable composition” refers to a composition that is suitable for administration to a mammal, preferably a human. Such compositions include various excipients, diluents, carriers, and such other inactive agents well known to the skilled artisan. “Pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to pharmaceutically acceptable salts, including pharmaceutically acceptable partial salts, of a compound, which salts are derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art and include, by way of example only, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, methane sulfonic acid, phosphorous acid, nitric acid, perchloric acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, malic acid, maleic acid, aconitic acid, salicylic acid, thalic acid, embonic acid, enanthic acid, oxalic acid and the like, and when the molecule contains an acidic functionality, include, by way of example only, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, tetraalkylammonium, and the like. “Therapeutically effective amount” or “therapeutic amount” refers to an amount of a drug or an agent that, when administered to a patient suffering from a condition, will have the intended therapeutic effect, e.g., alleviation, amelioration, palliation or elimination of one or more manifestations of the condition in the patient. The therapeutically effective amount will vary depending upon the patient and the condition being treated, the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the condition, the salt, solvate, or derivative of the active drug portion chosen, the particular composition or excipient chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, timing of administration, the manner of administration and the like, all of which can be determined readily by one of ordinary skill in the art. The full therapeutic effect does not necessarily occur by administration of one dose, and may occur only after administration of a series of doses. Thus, a therapeutically effective amount may be administered in one or more administrations. For example, and without limitation, a therapeutically effective amount of noribogaine, in the context of treating alcohol dependency, refers to an amount of noribogaine that attenuates the dependency and/or symptoms of acute withdrawal for at least 2 hours beyond control (placebo), at least 5 hours beyond control, and preferably at least 10 hours beyond control. A “therapeutic level” of a drug is an amount of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutical salt and/or solvate thereof that is sufficient to treat alcohol dependence or to treat, prevent, or attenuate acute withdrawal symptoms, but not high enough to pose any significant risk to the patient. Therapeutic levels of drugs can be determined by tests that measure the actual concentration of the compound in the blood of the patient. This concentration is referred to as the “serum concentration.” Where the serum concentration of noribogaine is mentioned, it is to be understood that the term “noribogaine” encompasses any form of noribogaine, including derivatives thereof. As defined herein, a “maintenance amount” of a drug is an amount, typically less than the therapeutically effective amount that provides attenuation and/or prevention of post-acute withdrawal syndrome in a patient. The maintenance amount of the compound is expected to be less than the therapeutically effective amount because the level of inhibition does not need to be as high in a patient who is no longer physically dependent upon alcohol. For example, a maintenance amount is preferably 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% less than a therapeutically effective amount, or any subvalue or subrange there between. As defined herein, a “prophylactically effective amount” of a drug is an amount, typically less than the therapeutically effective amount, that provides attenuation and/or prevention of a disease or disorder or symptoms of a disease or disorder in a patient. For example, the prophylactically effective amount of the compound is expected to be less than the therapeutically effective amount because the level of inhibition does not need to be as high in a patient who no longer has a disease or disorder or symptoms of a disease or disorder (e.g., no longer physically addicted to nicotine). For example, a prophylactically effective amount is preferably 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, or 10% less than a therapeutically effective amount. However, a prophylactically effective amount may be the same as the therapeutically effective amount, for example when a patient who is physically addicted to nicotine is administered noribogaine to attenuate cravings for a period of time when nicotine use is not feasible. The prophylactically effective amount may vary for different a diseases or disorders or symptoms of different diseases or disorders. “Treatment,” “treating,” and “treat” are defined as acting upon a disease, disorder, or condition with an agent, such as noribogaine, to reduce or ameliorate harmful or any other undesired effects of the disease, disorder, or condition and/or its symptoms. “Treatment,” as used herein, covers the treatment of a human patient, and includes: (a) reducing the risk of occurrence of the condition in a patient determined to be predisposed to the condition but not yet diagnosed as having the condition, (b) impeding the development of the condition, and/or (c) relieving the condition, i.e., causing regression of the condition and/or relieving one or more symptoms of the condition. “Treating” or “treatment of” a condition or patient refers to taking steps to obtain beneficial or desired results, including clinical results such as the reduction of symptoms. For purposes of this invention, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to: treating alcohol dependency; treating, preventing, and/or attenuating acute withdrawal symptoms; treating, preventing, and/or attenuating long-term (post-acute) withdrawal symptoms; and preventing relapse of alcohol use. As used herein, the term “patient” refers to mammals and includes humans and non-human mammals. As used herein, the term “QT interval” refers to the measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the electrical cycle of the heart. Prolongation of the QT interval refers to an increase in the QT interval. As used herein, the terms “addiction”, “abuse”, and “dependence” are used interchangeably to refer to the patient's inability to stop using alcohol, even when it would be in his/her best interest to stop. A patient may be physically and/or behaviorally addicted to a substance. The DSMIV-TR criteria for dependency include: Dependence or significant impairment or distress, as manifested by 3 or more of the following during a 12 month period:1. Tolerance or markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication or desired effect or markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of substance2. Withdrawal symptoms or the use of certain substances to avoid withdrawal symptoms3. Use of a substance in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended4. Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control substance use5. Involvement in chronic behavior to obtain the substance, use the substance, or recover from its effects6. Reduction or abandonment of social, occupational or recreational activities because of substance use7. Use of substances even though there is a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance. A “pharmaceutically acceptable solvate” or “hydrate” of a compound of the invention means a solvate or hydrate complex that is pharmaceutically acceptable and that possesses the desired pharmacological activity of the parent compound, and includes, but is not limited to, complexes of a compound of the invention with one or more solvent or water molecules, or 1 to about 100, or 1 to about 10, or one to about 2, 3 or 4, solvent or water molecules. Herein the term “solvate” is taken to mean that a solid-form of a compound that crystallizes with one or more molecules of solvent trapped inside. A few examples of solvents that can be used to create solvates, such as pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, include, but are certainly not limited to, water, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, C1-C6 alcohols in general (and optionally substituted), tetrahydrofuran, acetone, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, acetic acid, formic acid, water, and solvent mixtures thereof. Other such biocompatible solvents which may aid in making a pharmaceutically acceptable solvate are well known in the art and applicable to the present invention. Additionally, various organic and inorganic acids and bases can be added or even used alone as the solvent to create a desired solvate. Such acids and bases are known in the art. When the solvent is water, the solvate can be referred to as a hydrate. Further, by being left in the atmosphere or recrystallized, the compounds of the present invention may absorb moisture, may include one or more molecules of water in the formed crystal, and thus become a hydrate. Even when such hydrates are formed, they are included in the term “solvate”. Solvate also is meant to include such compositions where another compound or complex co-crystallizes with the compound of interest. The term “dose” refers to a range of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutical salt or solvate thereof that provides a therapeutic serum level of noribogaine when given to a patient in need thereof. The dose is recited in a range, for example from about 20 mg to about 120 mg, and can be expressed either as milligrams or as mg/kg body weight. The attending clinician will select an appropriate dose from the range based on the patient's weight, age, degree of addiction, health, and other relevant factors, all of which are well within the skill of the art. The term “unit dose” refers to a dose of drug that is given to the patient to provide therapeutic results, independent of the weight of the patient. In such an instance, the unit dose is sold in a standard form (e.g., 20 mg tablet). The unit dose may be administered as a single dose or a series of subdoses. In some embodiments, the unit dose provides a standardized level of drug to the patient, independent of weight of patient. Many medications are sold based on a dose that is therapeutic to all patients based on a therapeutic window. In such cases, it is not necessary to titrate the dosage amount based on the weight of the patient. II.

In some embodiments, the therapeutic dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or salt and/or solvate thereof is a tapered dosing over a period of time, during which the patient is detoxified, for example, without suffering significant acute withdrawal symptoms. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that tapering will allow the full therapeutic effect of noribogaine with less prolongation of the QT interval. Tapering involves administration of one or more subsequently lower doses of noribogaine over time. For example, in some embodiments, the first tapered dose is about 50% to about 95% of the first or original dose. In some embodiments, the second tapered dose is about 40% to about 90% of the first or original dose. In some embodiments, the third tapered dose is about 30% to about 85% of the first or original dose. In some embodiments, the fourth tapered dose is about 20% to about 80% of the first or original dose. In some embodiments, the fifth tapered dose is about 10% to about 75% of the first or original dose. The first tapered dose may be administered at any time after the previous dose of noribogaine. The first tapered dose can be given once, for example, followed by subsequent further tapered doses, or it can be given multiple times with or without subsequent, further tapered doses (e.g., second, third, fourth, etc. tapered doses), which likewise can be given once or over multiple administrations, for example. In some embodiments, the first tapered dose is given after the first dose of noribogaine.

In one embodiment, prescreening comprises ascertaining that noribogaine treatment will not result in a maximum QT interval over about 420 ms. In one embodiment, prescreening comprises determining the patient's pre-treatment QT interval. As it relates to pre-screening or pre-selection of patients, patients may be selected based on any criteria as determined by the skilled clinician. Such criteria may include, by way of non-limiting example, pre-treatment QT interval, pre-existing cardiac conditions, risk of cardiac conditions, age, sex, general health, and the like. The following are examples of selection criteria for disallowing noribogaine treatment or restricting dose of noribogaine administered to the patient: high QT interval before treatment (e.g., such that there is a risk of the patient's QT interval exceeding about 500 ms during treatment); congenital long QT syndrome; bradycardia; hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia; recent acute myocardial infarction; uncompensated heart failure; and taking other drugs that increase QT interval. In some embodiments, the methods can include selecting and/or administering/providing noribogaine to a patient that lacks one more of such criteria. In one embodiment, this invention relates to pre-screening a patient to determine if the patient is at risk for prolongation of the QT interval beyond a safe level. In one embodiment, a patient at risk for prolongation of the QT interval beyond a safe level is not administered noribogaine. In one embodiment, a patient at risk for prolongation of the QT interval beyond a safe level is administered noribogaine at a limited dosage. In one embodiment, this invention relates to monitoring a patient who is administered a therapeutic dose of noribogaine, noribogaine derivative, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or solvate thereof. In one embodiment, the dose of noribogaine is reduced if the patient has one or more adverse side effects. In one embodiment, the noribogaine treatment is discontinued if the patient has one or more adverse side effects. In one embodiment, the adverse side effect is a QT interval that is prolonged beyond a safe level. The determination of a safe level of prolongation is within the skill of a qualified clinician.

Possible formulations include tablets, capsules, pills, powders, aerosols, suppositories, parenterals, and oral liquids, including suspensions, solutions and emulsions. Sustained release dosage forms may also be used. All formulations may be prepared using methods that are standard in the art (see e.g., Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th ed., A. Oslo editor, Easton Pa. 1980). In a preferred embodiment, the formulation is designed for oral administration, which may conveniently be provided in tablet, caplet, sublingual, liquid or capsule form. In certain embodiments, the noribogaine is provided as noribogaine HCl, with dosages reported as the amount of free base noribogaine. In some embodiments, the noribogaine HCl is provided in hard gelatin capsules containing only noribogaine HCl with no excipients. Noribogaine or a noribogaine derivative can also be used in conjunction with any of the vehicles and excipients commonly employed in pharmaceutical preparations, e.g., talc, gum Arabic, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, cocoa butter, aqueous or non-aqueous solvents, oils, paraffin derivatives, glycols, etc. Coloring and flavoring agents may also be added to preparations, particularly to those for oral administration. Solutions can be prepared using water or physiologically compatible organic solvents such as ethanol, 1,2-propylene glycol, polyglycols, dimethylsulfoxide, fatty alcohols, triglycerides, partial esters of glycerine and the like. Parenteral compositions containing noribogaine may be prepared using conventional techniques that may include sterile isotonic saline, water, 1,3-butanediol, ethanol, 1,2-propylene glycol, polyglycols mixed with water, Ringer's solution, etc. The compositions utilized herein may be formulated for aerosol administration, particularly to the respiratory tract and including intrapulmonary or intranasal administration. The compound will generally have a small particle size, for example of the order of 5 microns or less. Such a particle size may be obtained by means known in the art, for example by micronization. The active ingredient may be provided in a pressurized pack with a suitable propellant such as a chlorofluorocarbon (CFC), (for example, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, or dichlorotetrafluoroethane), carbon dioxide or other suitable gases. The aerosol may conveniently also contain a surfactant such as lecithin. The dose of drug may be controlled by a metered valve. Alternatively, the active ingredients may be provided in the form of a dry powder, for example a powder mix of the compound in a suitable powder base such as lactose, starch, starch derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidine. In some embodiments, the powder carrier will form a gel in the nasal cavity. The powder composition may be presented in unit dose form, for example in capsules or cartridges, gelatin or blister packs, from which the powder may be administered by means of an inhaler. The compositions utilized herein may be formulated for sublingual administration, for example as sublingual tablets. Sublingual tablets are designed to dissolve very rapidly. The formulations of these tablets contain, in addition to the drug, a limited number of soluble excipients, usually lactose and powdered sucrose, but sometimes dextrose and mannitol. It has been discovered that noribogaine has a bitter taste to at least some patients. Accordingly, compositions for oral use (including sublingual, inhaled, and other oral formulations) may be formulated to utilize taste-masking technologies. A number of ways to mask the taste of bitter drugs are known in the art, including addition of sugars, flavors, sweeteners, or coatings; use of lipoproteins, vesicles, and/or liposomes; granulation; microencapsulation; numbing of taste buds; multiple emulsion; modification of viscosity; prodrug or salt formation; inclusion or molecular complexes; ion exchange resins; and solid dispersion. Any method of masking the bitterness of the compound of the invention may be used.

The following Examples are intended to further illustrate certain embodiments of the disclosure and are not intended to limit its scope. Example 1 Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Noribogaine in Humans Thirty-six healthy, drug-free male volunteers, aged between 18-55 years, were enrolled in and completed the study. This was an ascending single-dose, placebo-controlled, randomized double blind, parallel group study. Mean (SD) age was 22.0 (3.3) years, mean (SD) height was 1.82 (0.08) m, and mean (SD) weight was 78.0 (9.2) kg. Twenty-six subjects were Caucasian, 3 were Asian, 1 Maori, 1 Pacific Islander, and 5 Other. The protocol for this study was approved by the Lower South Regional Ethics Committee (LRS/12/06/015), and the study was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry (ACTRN12612000821897). All subjects provided signed informed consent prior to enrolment, and were assessed as suitable to participate based on review of medical history, physical examination, safety laboratory tests, vital signs and ECG. Within each dose level, 6 participants were randomized to receive noribogaine and 3 to receive placebo, based on a computer-generated random code. Dosing began with the lowest noribogaine dose, and subsequent cohorts received the next highest dose after the safety, tolerability, and blinded pharmacokinetics of the completed cohort were reviewed and dose-escalation approved by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board. Blinded study drug was administered as a capsule with 240 ml of water after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. Participants did not receive any food until at least 5 hours post-dose. Participants were confined to the study site from 12 hours prior to drug administration, until 72 hours post-dose, and there were subsequent outpatient assessments until 216 hours post-dose. Blood was obtained for pharmacokinetic assessments pre-dose and then at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72, 96, 120, 168 and 216 hours post-dose. Samples were centrifuged and plasma stored at −70° C. until analyzed. Block 24 hour urine collections were obtained following study drug administration for the 30 and 60 mg cohorts. Aliquots were frozen at −20° C. until analyzed. Pulse oximetry and capnography data were collected continuously using a GE Carescape B650 monitoring system from 2 hours prior to dosing and until six hours after dosing, and thereafter at 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-dosing. Additional oximetry data were collected at 120, 168 and 216 hours. Pupillary miosis was assessed by pupillometry. Dark-adapted pupil diameter was measured in triplicate using a Neuroptics PLR-200 pupillometer under standardized light intensity (<5 lux) pre-dose, and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 168 and 216 hours post-dosing. Plasma noribogaine concentrations were determined in the 3 mg and 10 mg dose groups using a validated, sensitive LCMSMS method. Sample preparation involved double extraction of basified plasma samples with tert-butyl methyl ether, drying the samples under a stream of nitrogen and reconstitution of sample with acetonitrile:B.P. water (5:95, v/v) containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The compounds were separated by a 150×2.0 mm Luna 5 μm C18 column and detected with a triple-quadrupole API 4000 or 5000 mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization in positive mode and multiple reaction monitoring. Noribogaine-d4 was used as the internal standard. The precursor-product ion transition values for noribogaine were m/z 297.6->122.3, and for the internal standard noribogaine-d4 m/z 301.1->122.2. Analyst® software was used for data acquisition and processing. The ratio of the peak area of noribogaine to the internal standard noribogaine-d4 was used for calibration and measurement of the unknown concentration of noribogaine. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.025 ng/ml noribogaine. The calibration curve was between 0.025 and 25.600 ng/ml noribogaine. Mobile phase A was acetonitrile:B.P. water (5:95, v/v) containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid, and mobile phase B was acetonitrile:B.P. water (95:5, v/v) containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Total run time was 6 minutes. Binary flow: Initial concentration was 8% mobile phase B; hold at 8% mobile phase B for 0.5 minutes and linear rise to 90% mobile phase B over 1.5 minutes; hold at 90% mobile phase B for 1 minute and then drop back to 8% mobile phase B over 0.01 minute. Equilibrate system for 3 minutes. Total run time was 6 minutes. Within- and between-day assay precision was <9%, and within- and between-day assay accuracy was <9%. Plasma noribogaine concentrations were determined in the 30 mg and 60 mg dose groups using a validated, sensitive LCMSMS method. Sample preparation involved deproteinization of plasma samples with acetonitrile and dilution of sample with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The compounds were separated by a 150×2.0 mm Luna 5 μm C18 column and detected with a triple-quadrupole API 4000 or 5000 mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization in positive mode and multiple reaction monitoring. Noribogaine-d4 was used as the internal standard. The precursor-product ion transition values for noribogaine were m/z 297.6->122.3, and for the internal standard noribogaine-d4 m/z 301.1->122.2. Analyst® software was used for data acquisition and processing. The ratio of the peak area of noribogaine to the internal standard noribogaine-d4 was used for calibration and measurement of the unknown concentration of noribogaine. The LLOQ was 0.50 ng/ml noribogaine. The calibration curve was between 0.50 and 256.00 ng/ml noribogaine. Mobile phase was the same as method A, and binary flow was also the same as method A. The within- and between-day assay precision was <9%, and the within- and between-day assay accuracy was <9%. Plasma noribogaine glucuronide concentrations were determined in the 30 mg and 60 mg dose groups using a validated sensitive LCMSMS method. Sample preparation involved deproteinization of plasma samples with acetonitrile, drying the samples under a stream of nitrogen and reconstitution of sample with acetonitrile:B.P. water (5:95, v/v) containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The compounds were separated by a 150×2.0 mm Luna 5 μm C18 column and detected with a triple-quadrupole API 4000 or 5000 mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization in positive mode and multiple reaction monitoring. Noribogaine-d4 was used as the internal standard. The precursor-product ion transition values for noribogaine glucuronide were m/z 472.8->297.3, and for the internal standard noribogaine-d4 m/z 301.1->122.2. Analyst® software was used for data acquisition and processing. The ratio of the peak area of noribogaine glucuronide to the internal standard noribogaine-d4 was used for calibration and measurement of the unknown concentration of noribogaine glucuronide. The LLOQ was 0.050 ng/ml noribogaine glucuronide. The calibration curve was between 0.050 and 6.400 ng/ml noribogaine glucuronide. Mobile phases was the same as method A. Binary flow: Initial concentration was 6% mobile phase B; hold at 6% mobile phase B for 0.5 minutes and linear rise to 90% mobile phase B over 2 minutes; hold at 90% mobile phase B for 1 minute and then drop back to 6% mobile phase B over 0.01 minute. Equilibrate system for 3.5 minutes. Total run time was 7 minutes. The within- and between-day assay precision was <11%, and the within- and between-day assay accuracy was <10%. Urine noribogaine and noribogaine glucuronide concentrations were determined in the 30 mg and 60 mg dose groups using a validated sensitive LCMSMS method. Sample preparation involved deproteinization of urine samples with acetonitrile and dilution of the sample with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. The compounds were separated by a 150×2.0 mm Luna 5 μm C18 column and detected with a triple-quadrupole API 4000 or 5000 mass spectrometer using electrospray ionization in positive mode and multiple reaction monitoring. Noribogaine-d4 was used as the internal standard. The precursor-product ion transition values for noribogaine were m/z 297.6->122.3, noribogaine glucuronide m/z 472.8->297.3, and for the internal standard noribogaine-d4 m/z 301.1->122.2. Analyst® software was used for data acquisition and processing. The ratios of the peak area of noribogaine and noribogaine glucuronide to the internal standard noribogaine-d4 were used for calibration and measurement of the unknown concentration of noribogaine and its glucuronide. Assay LLOQ was 20.0 ng/ml for noribogaine and 2.0 ng/ml for noribogaine glucuronide. The calibration curve was between 20.0 and 5120.0 ng/ml noribogaine, and 2.0 and 512.0 ng/ml noribogaine glucuronide. Mobile phases were as described in method A, and binary flow as in method C. The within- and between-day assay precision was <13%, and within- and between-day assay accuracy was <12%. Noribogaine and noribogaine glucuronide concentrations above the limit of quantification were used to calculate pharmacokinetic parameters using model-independent methods. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) were the observed values. Plasma concentration data in the post-distribution phase of the plasma concentration-time plot were fitted using linear regression to the formula ln C=ln Co−t·Kel, where Co was the zero-time intercept of the extrapolated terminal phase and Kel was the terminal elimination rate constant. The half-life (t112) was determined using the formula t1/2=0.693/Kel. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to the last determined concentration-time point (tf) in the post distribution phase was calculated using the trapezoidal rule. The area under the curve from the last concentration-time point in the post distribution phase (Ctf) to time infinity was calculated from AUCt-∞=Ctf/Kel. The concentration used for Ctf was the last determined value above the LLOQ at the time point. The total AUC0-∞ was obtained by adding AUCtf and AUCt-∞. Noribogaine apparent clearance (CL/F) was determined using the formula CL/F=Dose/AUC0-∞×1000, and apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) was determined using the formula Vd/F=(CL/F)/Kel. Total urine noribogaine was the sum of both analytes. Summary statistics (means, standard deviations, and coefficients of variation) were determined for each dose group for safety laboratory test data, ECG and pharmacokinetic parameters, and pharmacodynamic variables. Categorical variables were analysed using counts and percentages. Dose-proportionality of AUC and Cmax was assessed using linear regression. The effect of dose on pharmacodynamic parameter values over time was assessed using two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA). Pairwise comparisons (with Tukey-Kramer adjustment) between each dose group to the placebo were conducted at each time point using the least squares estimates obtained from the ANOVA, using SAS Proc Mixed (SAS ver 6.0). Results Pharmacokinetics: Mean plasma concentration-time plots of noribogaine are shown in FIG. 1, and mean pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in Table 1.

Fluctuations in individual distribution-phase concentration-time profiles may suggest the possibility of enterohepatic recirculation (see highlighted individual 4-8 hour profiles in FIG. 1, insert). Both Cmax and AUC increased linearly with dose (Table 1, upper panel). Mean half-life estimates of 28-50 hours were observed across dose groups for noribogaine. Volume of distribution was extensive (1417-3086 L across dose groups). Mean plasma noribogaine glucuronide concentration-time plots for the 30 mg and 60 mg dose group are shown in FIG. 2, and mean pharmacokinetic parameters are shown in Table 1, lower panel. Noribogaine glucuronide was detected in all subjects by 0.75 hours, with peak concentrations occurring 3-4 hours after noribogaine dosing. Mean half-life of 21-23 hours was estimated for plasma noribogaine glucuronide. The proportion of noribogaine glucuronide Cmax and AUC relative to noribogaine was 3-4% for both dose groups. Total urine noribogaine elimination was 1.16 mg and 0.82 mg for the 30 mg and 60 mg dose groups respectively, representing 3.9% and 1.4% of the doses administered. The subject mean serum levels over time of noribogaine free base from a single dose of 3 mg noribogaine free base under fasting conditions were plotted. The mean Cmax of 5.2 ng/ml was observed 1.9 hours after administration, while the mean AUC/24 hr of 3.1 ng/ml was obtained. The subject mean serum levels over time of noribogaine free base from a single dose of 10 mg noribogaine free base under fasting conditions were plotted. The mean Cmax of 14.5 ng/ml was observed 2.9 hours after administration, while the mean AUC/24 hr of 10.6 ng/ml was obtained. The subject mean serum levels over time of noribogaine free base from a single dose of 30 mg noribogaine free base under fasting conditions were plotted. The mean Cmax of 55.9 ng/ml was observed between 1.75 hours after administration, while the mean AUC/24 of 29.2 ng/ml was obtained. The subject mean serum levels over time of noribogaine free base from a single dose of 60 mg noribogaine free base under fasting conditions were plotted. The mean Cmax of 116 ng/ml was observed between 1.75 hours after administration, while the mean AUC/24 ng/ml of 61 was obtained. The subject mean serum levels over time of noribogaine free base for all 4 cohorts were plotted. The extrapolated dosage of noribogaine free base required to provide a Cmax ranging from about 5.2 ng/ml to about 1980 ng/ml and an AUC/24 hr of about 3.1 ng/ml to about 1100 ng/ml was determined. Pharmacodynamics: There was no evidence of pupillary constriction in subjects dosed with noribogaine. No between-dose group differences in pupil diameter were detected over time. After adjusting for baseline differences, comparison of each dose group with placebo by ANOVA showed no statistically significant differences (p>0.9). Noribogaine treatment showed no analgesic effect in the cold pressor test. Analgesic effect was assessed based on duration of hand immersion in ice water and on visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores upon hand removal from the water bath. For duration of hand immersion, after adjusting for baseline differences, comparison of each dose group with placebo by ANOVA showed no statistically significant differences (p>0.9). Similarly, for VAS pain scores, after adjusting for baseline differences, comparison of each dose group with placebo by ANOVA showed no statistically significant differences (p=0.17). Example 2 Safety and Tolerability of Noribogaine in Healthy Humans Safety and tolerability of noribogaine were tested in the group of volunteers from Example 1. Cold pressor testing was conducted in 1° C. water according to the method of Mitchell et al. (J Pain 5:233-237, 2004) pre-dose, 6, 24, 48, 72 and 216 hours post-dosing. Safety evaluations included clinical monitoring, recording of adverse events (AEs), safety laboratory tests, vital signs, ECG telemetry from −2 h to 6 h after dosing, and 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) up to 216 hours post-dosing. Results A total of thirteen adverse events were reported by seven participants (Table 2). Six adverse events were reported by three participants in the placebo group, five adverse events were reported by two subjects in the 3 mg dose group, and one adverse event was reported by single subjects in the 10 mg and 30 mg dose groups, respectively. The most common adverse events were headache (four reports) and epistaxis (two reports). All adverse events were of mild-moderate intensity, and all resolved prior to study completion. There were no changes in vital signs or safety laboratory tests of note. In particular, there were no changes in oximetry or capnography, or changes in respiratory rate. There were no QTcF values >500 msec at any time. One subject dosed with 10 mg noribogaine had a single increase in QTcF of >60 msec at 24 hours post-dosing.

While the therapy employed is directed to opioid-dependent participants in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial, the results show that a therapeutic window can be established for noribogaine. The efficacy of noribogaine in humans was evaluated in opioid-dependent participants in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial. Patients had been receiving methadone treatment as the opioid substitution therapy, but were transferred to morphine treatment prior to noribogaine administration. This was done to avoid negative noribogaine-methadone interactions that are not observed between noribogaine and morphine. See U.S. application Ser. No. 14/214,157, filed Mar. 14, 2014 and Ser. No. 14/346,655, filed Mar. 21, 2014, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Three cohorts of nine (9) subjects (6 administered noribogaine and 3 administered placebo in each cohort) were evaluated for tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. Cohort 1 received a single dose of 60 mg noribogaine or placebo. Cohort 2 received a single dose of 120 mg noribogaine or placebo. Cohort 3 received a single dose of 180 mg noribogaine or placebo. Treatment was administered 2 hours after last morphine dose and the time to resumption of morphine (opioid substitution treatment, OST) was determined. Few adverse effects of noribogaine were observed in any of the participants, including no hallucinatory effects. Table 3 shows the reported adverse events for each treatment that were not attributable to withdrawal from opioids. Headaches were frequent in the placebo and 60 mg noribogaine treatment groups, but were attenuated in the 120 mg and 180 mg dose groups.

FIG. 3 indicates the average serum noribogaine concentration over time after administration of noribogaine for each cohort (60 mg, diamonds; 120 mg, squares; or 180 mg, triangles). Further results are detailed in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 62/023,100, filed Jul. 10, 2014, and titled “METHODS FOR ACUTE AND LONG-TERM TREATMENT OF DRUG ADDICTION,” which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Results Pharmacokinetic results for each cohort are given in Table 4. Maximum serum concentration of noribogaine (Cmax) increased in a dose-dependent manner. Time to Cmax (Tmax) was similar in all three cohorts. Mean half-life of serum noribogaine was similar to that observed in healthy patients. TABLE 4 Pharmacokinetic results from the Patients in Phase IB Study Cohort 1 (60 mg) Cohort 2 (120 mg) Cohort 3 (180 mg) Data (mean ± SD) Data (mean ± SD) Data (mean ± SD) PK parameter [range] [range] [range] Cmax 81.64 ± 23.77 172.79 ± 30.73 267.88 ± 46.92 (ng/ml) [41.29-113.21] [138.84-229.55] [204.85-338.21] Tmax 3.59 ± 0.92 2.99 ± 1.23 4.41 ± 1.80 (hours) [2.50-5.00] [0.98-4.02] [3.00-8.00] AUC(0-T) 2018.01 ± 613.91 3226.38 ± 1544.26 6523.28 ± 2909.80 (ng · hr/ml) [1094.46-2533.44] [1559.37-5638.98] [3716.69-10353.12] AUC(0-¥) 2060.31 ± 609.39 3280.50 ± 1581.43 6887.67 ± 3488.91 (ng · hr/ml) [1122.29-2551.63] [1595.84-5768.52] [3734.21-12280.91] Half-life 29.32 ± 7.28 30.45 ± 9.14 23.94 ± 5.54 (hrs) [18.26-37.33] [21.85-48.33] [19.32-34.90] Vd/F 1440.7 ± 854.0 2106.43 ± 1644.54 1032.19 ± 365.30 [619.5-2772.5] [824.24-5243.78] [581.18-1608.98] Cl/F 32.14 ± 12.38 44.68 ± 21.40 31.47 ± 13.12 [23.51-53.46] [20.80-75.20] [14.66-48.20] FIG. 4 indicates the time to resumption of morphine (OST) for patients treated with placebo (circles), 60 mg noribogaine (squares), 120 mg noribogaine (triangles), and 180 mg noribogaine (inverted triangles). Patients receiving a single 120 mg dose of noribogaine exhibited an average time to resumption of opioids of greater than 20 hours. Patients receiving a single 180 mg dose of noribogaine exhibited an average time to resumption of opioids similar to that of placebo. This demonstrates that increasing the dose of noribogaine to 180 mg results in a shorter time to resumption of OST than observed in patients receiving 120 mg noribogaine. Time to resumption of OST after treatment with 180 mg was still longer than untreated patients (7 hours, not shown) or those administered 60 mg noribogaine. Patients were evaluated based on the Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale (COWS), Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS), and Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (OOWS) scoring systems over the period of time between administration of noribogaine (or placebo) until resumption of OST. These scales are outlined in Guidelines for the Psychosocially Assisted Pharmacological Treatment of Opioid Dependence, World Health Organization, Geneva (2009), Annex 10, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The scales measure the intensity of withdrawal symptoms, based on clinical, subjective, and objective indicia. FIG. 5 shows the COWS scores at time of resumption of OST for each cohort. Box includes values representing 25%-75% quartiles. Diamond=median; crossbar in box=mean; whiskers=values within standard deviation of mid-quartiles. No outliers present. The highly variable COWS scores across and within each cohort indicates that patients were resuming opiates without relation to the intensity of withdrawal. This was also reflected in SOWS and OOWS scores at the time of resumption of OST. FIG. 6A shows the mean change in total COWS scores over the first six hours following dosing and prior to resumption of OST. FIG. 6B shows the mean AUC(0-6 hours) of the COWS total score change from baseline. FIG. 7A shows the mean change in total OOWS scores over the first six hours following dosing and prior to resumption of OST. FIG. 7B shows the mean AUC(0-6 hours) of the OOWS total score change from baseline. FIG. 8A shows the mean change in total SOWS scores over the first six hours following dosing and prior to resumption of OST. FIG. 8B shows the mean AUC(0-6 hours) of the SOWS total score change from baseline. These data indicate that withdrawal symptoms get worse over time after cessation of OST, and that patients administered placebo experience generally worse withdrawal symptoms over that period. Patients who received 120 mg noribogaine generally experienced fewer withdrawal symptoms than the other patients, regardless of the scale used. Patients administered placebo generally experienced more withdrawal symptoms than patients who were administered noribogaine. Patients' QT intervals were evaluated at regular time points throughout the study. FIG. 9A shows the average change in QT interval (ΔQTc1, i.e., QT interval prolongation) over the first 24 hours post noribogaine (or placebo) administration. FIG. 9B shows the estimated correlation between noribogaine concentration and change in QT interval. There is a dose-dependent increase in QT interval prolongation that is correlated with the serum concentration of noribogaine. Based on above data, it is believed that the therapeutic window for a single bolus dose of noribogaine is bound at the lower end by 50 mg and at the upper end by less than 180 mg. In particular, the therapeutic serum concentration in vivo appears to be between about 50 ng/mL and about 180 ng/mL. Example 4 Effect of Noribogaine on Withdrawal from Alcohol in Humans Six patients are orally administered a single dose of 2 mg/kg noribogaine, and three patients receive placebo in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.
