A mixture of (6S,8R)-6-(4-(azetidin-3-yloxy)-2-methoxyphenyl)-7-(2,2-difluoroethyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (178 mg, 0.42 mmol), 1-fluoro-3-iodopropane (94 mg, 0.50 mmol), and DIPEA (0.218 mL, 1.25 mmol) in DMF (4 mL) was stirred at room temperature for 18 hours. The reaction was then diluted with DCM and washed with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride. The layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with DCM. The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by preparative SFC (2-ethylpyridine column; 19 mm×150 mm; 5 μm; flow rate: 75 mL/min; column temperature: 40° C.; outlet pressure: 100 bar), eluting with 15% (methanol containing 0.2% ammonium hydroxide) in carbon dioxide to afford (6S,8R)-7-(2,2-difluoroethyl)-6-(4-((1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)oxy)-2-methoxyphenyl)-8-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (70 mg, 35% over two steps) as a white solid.
