WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 FACTOR VIII-Fc CHIMERIC AND HYBRID POLYPEPTIDES, AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to the field of therapeutics for hemostatic disorders. [0002] IOOO3l [00041 Background Art Hemophilia A is an X-linked bleeding disorder caused by mutations and/or deletions in the factor VIII (FVIII) gene resulting in a deficiency of FVIII activity (Peyvandi et al. 2006). The disease is characterized by spontaneous hemorrhage and excessive bleeding after trauma. Over time, the repeated bleeding into muscles and joints, which often begins in early childhood, results in hemophilic arthropathy and irreversible joint damage. This damage is progressive and can lead to severely limited mobility of joints, muscle atrophy and chronic pain (Rodriguez-Merchan, E.C., Semin. Thromb. Hemost. 29:87-96 (2003), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). The A2 domain is necessary for the procoagulant activity of the factor VIII molecule. Studies show that porcine factor VIII has six-fold greater procoagulant activity than human factor VIII (Lollar, P., and E. T. Parker, J. Biol. Chem. 266:12481-12486 (1991)), and that the difference in coagulant activity between human and porcine factor VIII appears to be based on a difference in amino acid sequence between one or more residues in the human and porcine A2 domains (Loller, P., et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267:23652-23657 (1992)), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Treatment of hemophilia A is by replacement therapy targeting restoration of FVIII activity to 1 to 5 % of normal levels to prevent spontaneous bleeding (Mannucci, P.M., et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 344:1773-1779 (2001), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). There are plasma-derived and recombinant FVIII products available to treat bleeding episodes on-demand or to prevent bleeding episodes from occurring by treating prophylactically. Based on the half-life of these products treatment WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 Iooo51 regimens require frequent intravenous administration. Such frequent administration is painful and inconvenient. Reduced mortality, prevention of joint damage and improved quality of life have been important achievements due to the development of plasma-derived and recombinant FVIII. Prolonged protection from bleeding would represent another key advancement in the treatment of hemophilia A patients. However, to date, no products that allow for prolonged protection have been developed. Therefore, there remains a need for improved methods of treating hemophilia due to factor VIII deficiency that are more tolerable and more effective than current therapies. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [ooo61 [00071 The present invention provides methods of administering Factor VIII; methods of administering chimeric polypeptides comprising Factor VIII and hybrids of such chimeric polypeptides; chimeric polypeptides comprising Factor VIII and hybrids of such chimeric polypeptides; polynucleotides encoding such chimeric and hybrid polypeptides; cells comprising such polynucleotides; and methods of producing such chimeric and hybrid polypeptides using such cells. The present invention provides a method of administering Factor VIII to a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic dose of a chimeric Factor VIII polypeptide, e.g., a chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptide, at a dosing interval at least about one and one-half times longer than the dosing interval required for an equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without the non-Factor VIII portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII portion), e.g., without the Fc portion. The dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half to six times longer, one and one-half to five times longer, one and one-half to four times longer, one and one-half to three times longer, or one and one-half to two times longer, than the dosing interval required for an equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without the non-Factor VIII portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII portion), e.g., the Fc portion. The dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half, two, two and one-half, three, three and one-half, four, four and one-half, five, rive and one-half or six times longer than the dosing interval required for an equivalent amount of said Factor VIII withom the nonFactor VIII portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII portion), e.g., the Fc WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 [oolo1 Ioo1 1 [00131 [00141 portion.

The present invention also provides improved Factor VIII chimeric polypeptides, Factor VIII chimeric polynucleotides, and methods of production. Treatment of hemophilia A is by replacement therapy targeting restoration of FVIII activity to 1 to 5 % of normal levels to prevent spontaneous bleeding (Mannucci, P.M., et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 344:1773-9 (2001), herein incorporated by reference in its entirety). There are plasma-derived and recombinant VIII products available to treat bleeding episodes on-demand or to prevent bleeding episodes from occurring by treating prophylactically. Based on the half-life of these products (10-12 hr) (White G.C., et al., Thromb. Haemost. 77:660-7 (1997); Morfini, M., Haemophilia 9 (suppl 1):94-99; discussion 100 (2003)), treatment regimens require frequent intravenous administration, commonly two to three times weekly for prophylaxis and one to three times daily for ondemand treatment (Manco-Johnson, M.J., et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 357:535-544 (2007)), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Such frequent administration is painful and inconvenient. The present invention provides a method of administering Factor VIII to a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic dose of a chimeric Factor VIII polypeptide, e.go, a chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptide, or a hybrid of such a polypeptide at a dosing interval at least about one and one-half times longer than the WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 [00441 [oo451 [00461 [00481 [00491 dosing interval required for an equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without the nonFactor VIII portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII portion), e.g., without the Fc portion. The dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half to six times longer, one and one-half to rive times longer, one and one-half to four times longer, one and one-half to three times longer, or one and one-half to two times longer, than the dosing interval required for an equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without the non-Factor VIII portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII portion), e.g., without the Fc portion. The dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half, two, two and one-half, three, three and one-half, four, four and one-half, rive, rive and one-half or six times longer than the dosing interval required for an equivalent anaount of said Factor VIII without the nonFactor VIII portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII portion), e.g., without the Fc portion. The dosing interval may be about every rive, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, or fourteen days or longer. The dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half to 5, one and one-half, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days or longer. The present invention also provides a method of administering Factor VIII to a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic dose of a chimeric Factor VIII polypeptide, e.go, a chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptide, or a hybrid of such a polypeptide to obtain an area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) at least about one and one-quarter times greater than the Auc obtained by an equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without non-Factor VIII portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII portion), e.g., without the Fc portion. The present invention also provides a method of administering Factor VIII to a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutic dose of a polypeptide comprising a Factor VIII and an Fc or a hybrid of such a polypeptide at a dosing interval of about every rive, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, or fourteen days or longer. The methods of the invention may be practiced on a subject in need of prophylactic treatment or on-demand treatment. "Administering," as used herein, means to give a pharmaceutically acceptable Factor VIII polypeptide of the invention to a subject via a pharmaceutically acceptable WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 ioosol 1oo511 [0052] route. Preferred routes of administration are intravenous, e.g., intravenous injection and imravenous infusion. Additional routes of administration include, e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, oral, nasal, and pulmonary administration. Chimeric polypeptides and hybrid proteins may be administered as part of a pharmaceutical composition comprising at least one excipient. "Area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC)," as used herein, is the same as the term of art in pharmacology, and is based upon the rate and extent of absorption if factor VIII following administration. AUC is determined over a specified time period, such as 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, or 72 hours, or for infinity using extrapolation based on the slope of the curve. Unless otherwise specified herein, AUC is determined for infinity. The determination of AUC may be carried out in a single subject, or in a population of subjects for which the average is calculated. "B domain" of Factor VIII, as used herein, is the same as the B domain known in the art that is defined by internal amino acid sequence identity and sites of proteolytic cleavage by thrombin, e.g., residues Ser741-Arg1648 of full length human factor VIII. The other human factor VIII domains are defined by the following amino acid residues: Al, residues Alal-Arg372; A2, residues Ser373-Arg740; A3, residues Ser1690-Ile2032; C 1, residues Arg2033-Asn2172; C2, residues Ser2173-Tyr2332. The A3-C 1-C2 sequence includes residues Ser1690-Tyr2332. The remaining sequence, residues Glu1649Arg1689, is usually referred to as the factor VIII light chain activation peptide. The locations of the boundaries for ail of the domains, including the B domains, for porcine, mouse and canine factor VIII are also known in the art. Preferably, the B domain of Factor VIII is deleted ("B domain deleted factor VIII" or "BDD FVIII"). An example of a BDD FVIII is REFACTO (recombinant BDD FVIII), which has the same sequence as the Factor VIII portion of the sequence in Table 2A(i) (amino acids -19 to 1438 or 1 to 1438 of SEQ ID NO:2). A "B domain deleted factor VIII" may have the full or partial deletions disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,316,226, 6,346,513, 7,041,635, 5,789,203, 6,060,447, 5,595,886, 6,228,620, 5,972,885, 6,048,720, 5,543,502, 5,610,278, 5,171,844, 5,112,950, 4,868,112, and 6,458,563, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.

Mitt. (1988) No 82:16-25, EP 295597)), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Each of the foregoing deletions may be made in any Factor VIII sequence. "Chimeric polypeptide," as used herein, means a polypeptide that includes within it at least two polypeptides (or subsequences or peptides) from different sources. WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 -IIPCT/US2010/059136 Ioo551 1oo561 Chimeric polypeptides may include, e.g., two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more polypeptides from different sources, such as different genes, different cDNAs, or different animal or other species. Chimeric polypeptides may include, e.g., one or more linkers joining the different subsequences. Thus, the subsequences may be joined directly or they may be joined indirectly, via linkers, or both, within a single chimeric polypeptide. Chimeric polypeptides may include, e.g., additional peptides such as signal sequences and sequences such as 6His and FLAG that aid in protein purification or detection.

Exemplary chimeric polypeptides of the invention include, e.g., chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptides, chimeric Factor VIII-XTEN polypeptides, and chimeric Factor VIII-albumin polypeptides. Exemplary chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptides include, e.g., SEQ ID NOs:2, 6, 8, 10, and 12 (Table 2), with or without their signal sequences and the chimeric Fc polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:4 (Table 2). The chimeric polypeptide may comprise a sequence at least 90% or 95% identical to the Factor VIII and Fc amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(i) without a signal sequence (amino acids 1 to 1665 of SEQ ID NO:2) or at least 90% or 95% identical to the Factor VIII and Fc amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(i) with a signal sequence (amino acids -19 to 1665 of SEQ ID NO:2). The chimeric polypeptide may comprise a sequence identical to the Factor VIII and Fc amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(i) without a signal sequence (amino acids 1 to 1665 of SEQ ID NO:2) or identical to the Factor VIII and Fc amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(i) with a signal sequence (amino acids -19 to 1665 of SEQ ID NO:2). As discussed above, exemplary chimeric polypeptides include Factor VIII fused to one or more XTEN polypeptides. Schellenburger et al., Nat. Biotech. 27:1186-90 (2009), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Factor VIII can be fused to either the N-terminal end of the XTEN polypeptide or to the C-terminal end of the XTEN polypeptide, provided the Factor VIII component of the Factor VIII-XTEN fusion protein can be processed by an protease to yield a processed Factor VIII containing polypeptide.

XTEN polypeptides include, e.g., those disclosed in WO 2009/023270, WO 2010/091122, WO 2007/103515, US 2010/0189682, and US 2009/0092582, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As discussed above, exemplary chimeric polypeptides also include Factor VIII fused to one or more albumin polypeptides. Preferably the albumin is human albumin. Factor VIII can be fused to either the N-terminal end of the albumin or to the C-terminal end of the albumin, provided the Factor VIII component of the Factor VIII-albumin fusion protein can be processed by an enzymatically-active proprotein convertase to yield a processed Factor VIII-containing polypeptide. Examples of albumin, e.g., fragments thereof, that may be used in the present invention are known, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 7,592,010; U.S. Patent No. 6,686,179; and Schulte, Thrombosis Res. 124 Suppl. 2:$6-$8 (2009), each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, a chimeric polypeptide comprising a Factor VIII portion has an increased half-life (tl/2) over a polypeptide consisting of the same Factor VIII portion without the non Factor VIII portion. A chimeric Factor VIII polypeptide with an increased tl/2 may be referred to herein as a long-acting Factor VIII. Long-acting chimeric Factor VIII polypeptides include, e.g., Factor VIII fused to Fc (including, e.g., chimeric Factor VIII polypeptides in the form of a hybrid such as a FVIIIFc monomer dimer hybrid; see Example 1, Fig. 1, and Table 2A; and US Patent Nos. 7,404,956 and 7,348,004), Factor VIII fused to XTEN, and Factor VIII fused to albumin. "Culture," "to culture" and "culturing," as used herein, means to incubate cells under in vitro conditions that allow for cell growth or division or to maintain cells in a living state. "Cultured cells," as used herein, means cells that are propagated in vitro. "Factor VIII," as used herein, means functional factor VIII polypeptide in its normal role in coagulation, unless otherwise specified. Thus, the term Factor VIII includes variant polypeptides that are functional. Preferred factor VIII proteins are the human, porcine, canine, and murine factor VIII proteins. As described in the Backgro md Art section, the full length polypeptide and polynucleotide sequences are known, as are many functional fragments, mutants and modified versions. Examples of human factor VIII sequences are shown as subsequences in SEQ ID NOs:2, 6, 8, 10, and 12 (Table 2). Factor VIII polypeptides include, e.g., full-length factor VIII, full-length factor VIII WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 [0062] 1oo631 [00641 minus Met at the N-terminus, mature factor VIII (minus the signal sequence), mature factor VIII with an additional Met at the N-terminus, and/or factor VIII with a full or partial deletion of the B domain. Preferred Factor VIII variants include B domain deletions, whether partial or full deletions. A great many functional factor VIII variants are known, as is discussed above and below. In addition, hundreds of nonfunctional mutations in factor VIII have been identified in hemophilia patients, and it has been determined that the effect of these mutations on factor VIII function is due more to where they lie within the 3-dimensional structure of factor VIII than on the nature of the substitution (Cutler et al., Hum. Mutat. 19:274-8 (2002)), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In addition, comparisons between factor VIII from humans and other species has identified conserved residues that are likely to be required for function (Cameron et al., Thromb. Haemost. 79:317-22 (1998); US 6 251,632), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The human factor VIII gene was isolated and expressed in mammalian cells (Toole, J.

S., also discloses the porcine cDNA and deduced amino acid sequences. 6,458,563, incorporated herein by reference in its emirety assigned to Emory discloses a B-domain deleted porcine Factor VIII. The Factor VIII (or Factor VIII portion of a chimeric polypeptide) may be at least 90% or 95% identical to a Factor VIII amino acid sequence shown in Table 2 without a signal sequence (amino acids 1 to 1438 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 1 to 2332 of SEQ ID NO:6; amino acids 1 to 740 ofSEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 1 to 745 ofSEQ ID NO:10; or amino acids 1 to 684 of SEQ ID NO: 12). The Factor VIII (or Factor VIII portion of a WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 [00681 {00691 1oo7ol chimeric polypeptide) may be identical to a Factor VIII amino acid sequence shown in Table 2 without a signal sequence (amino acids 1 to 1438 ofSEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 1 to 2332 of SEQ ID NO:6; amino acids 1 to 740 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 1 to 745 of SEQ ID NO:10; or amino acids 1 to 684 ofSEQ ID NO:12). The Factor VIII (or Factor VIII portion of a chimeric polypeptide) may be at least 90% or 95% identical to a Factor VIII amino acid sequence shown in Table 2 with a signal sequence (amino acids -19 to 1438 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids -19 to 2332 of SEQ ID NO:6; amino acids -19 to 740 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids -19 to 745 of SEQ ID NO: 10; or amino acids -20 to 684 of SEQ ID NO: 12). The Factor VIII (or Factor VIII portion of a chimeric polypeptide) may be identical to a Factor VIII amino acid sequence shown in Table 2 with a signal sequence (amino acids -19 to 1438 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids -19 to 2332 of SEQ ID NO:6; amino acids -19 to 740 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids -19 to 745 of SEQ ID NO: 10; or amino acids -20 to 684 of SEQ ID NO: 12). "Equivalent amount," as used herein, means the same amount of Factor VIII activity as expressed in International Units, which is independent of molecular weight of the polypeptide in question. One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity corresponds approximately to the quantity of factor VIII in one milliliter of normal human plasma. Several assays are available for measuring Factor VIII activity, including the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic substrate assay and a one stage clotting assay. "Fc," as used herein, means functional neonatal Fo receptor (FcRn) binding partners, unless otherwise specified. An FcRn binding partner is any molecule that can be specifically bound by the FcRn receptor with consequent active transport by the FcRn receptor of the FcRn binding partner. Thus, the term Fc includes any variants of IgG Fc that are functional. The region of the Fc portion of IgG that binds to the FcRn receptor has been described based on X-ray crystallography (Burmeister et al. 1994, Nature 372:379, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The major contact area of the Fc with the FcRn is near the junction of the CH2 and CH3 domains. Fc-FcRn contacts are all within a single Ig heavy chain. The FcRn binding partners include, e.g., whole IgG, the Fc fragment of IgG, and other fragments of IgG that include the complete binding region of FcRn. The major contact sites include amino acid residues 248, 250-257, 272, 285, 288, 290-291,308-311, and 314 of the CH2 domain and amino acid residues 385387, 428, and 433-436 of the CH3 domain. References made to amino acid numbering of WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 [00711 [0072] immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments, or regions, are all based on Kabat et al. 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U. S. Department of Public Health, Bethesda; MD, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. (The FcRn receptor has been isolated from several mammalian species including humans. The sequences of the human FcRn, rat FcRn, and mouse FcRn are known (Story et al. 1994, J. Exp. Med. 180: 2377), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.) An Fc may comprise the CH2 and CH3 domains of an immunoglobulin with or without the hinge region of the immunoglobulin. Exemplary Fc variants are provided in WO 2004/101740 and WO 2006/074199, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Fc (or Fc portion of a chimeric polypeptide) may contain one or more mutations, and combinations of mutations. Fc (or Fc portion of a chimeric polypeptide) may contain mutations conferring increased half-life such as M252Y, $254T, T256E, and combinations thereof, as disclosed in Oganesyan et al., Mol. Immunol. 46:1750 (2009), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; H433K, N434F, and combinations thereof, as disclosed in Vaccaro et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 23:1283 (2005), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; the mutants disclosed at pages 1-2, paragraph [0012], and Examples 9 and 10 of US 2009/0264627 Al, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; and the mutants disclosed at page 2, paragraphs [0014] to [0021] of US 20090163699 Al, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Fc (or Fc portion of a chimeric polypeptide) may also include, e.g., the following mutations: The Fc region of IgG can be modified according to well recognized procedures such as site directed mutagenesis and the like to yield modified IgG or Fc fragments or portions thereof that will be bound by FcRn. Such modifications include, e.g., modifications remote from the FcRn contact sites as well as modifications within the contact sites that preserve or even enhance binding to the FcRn. For example the following single amino acid residues in human IgG1 Fc (Fcyl) can be substituted without significant loss of Fc binding affinity for FcRn: P238A, $239A, K246A, K248A, D249A, M252A, T256A, E258A, T260A, D265A, $267A, H268A, E269A, D270A, E272A, L274A, N276A, Y278A, D280A, V282A, E283A, H285A, N286A, T289A, K290A, R292A, E293A, E294A, Q295A, Y296F, N297A, $298A, Y300F, R301A, V303A, V305A, T307A, L309A, Q311A, D312A, N315A, K317A, E318A, K320A, K322A, WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 $324A, K326A, A327Q, T335A, $337A, K338A, M358A, T359A, K360A, E382A, $383A, N384A, S400A, D401A, D413A, P329A, A330Q, A330S, P331A, K340A, Q342A, R344A, E345A, N361A, Q362A, Y373A, $375A Q386A, E388A, N389A, N390A, K414A, R416A, Q41 SA, Q419A, P331S, E333A, K334A, Q347A, R355A, E356A, D376A, A378Q, E380A, Y391F, K392A, L398A, N421A, V422A, $424A, E430A, N434A, T437A, Q438A, K439A, $440A, $444A, and K447A, where for example P238A represents wildtype proline substituted by alanine at position number 238. In addition to alanine other amino acids may be substituted for the wildtype amino acids at the positions specified above. Mutations may be introduced singly into Fc giving rise to more than one hundred FcRn binding partners distinct from native Fc. Additionally, combinations of two, three, or more of these individual mutations may be introduced together, giving rise to hundreds more FcRn binding partners. Certain of these mutations may confer new functionality upon the FcRn binding partner. For example, one embodiment incorporates N297A, removing a highly conserved N-glycosylation site. The effect of this mutation is to reduce imnmnogenicity, thereby enhancing circulating halflife of the FcRn binding partner, and to render the FcRn binding partner incapable of binding to FcyRI, FcyRIIA, FcyRIIB, and FcyRIIIA, without compromising affinity for FcRn (Routledge et al. 1995, Transplantation 60:847, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; Friend et al. 1999, Transplantation 68:1632, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; Shields et al. 1995, J. Bioh Chem. 276:6591, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Additionally, at least three human Fc gamma receptors appear to recognize a binding site on IgG within the lower hinge region, generally amino acids 234-237. Therefore, another example of new functionality and potential decreased immunogenicity may arise from mutations of this region, as for example by replacing amino acids 233-236 of human IgG1 "ELLG" to the corresponding sequence from IgG2 "PVA" (with one amino acid deletion). It has been shown that FcyRI, FcyRII, and FcyRIII which mediate various effector functions will not bind to IgG1 when such mutations have been introduced (Ward and Ghetie 1995, Therapeutic Immunology 2:77, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; and Armour et alo1999, Eur. J. Immunol. 29:2613, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). As a further example of new functionality arising from mutations described above affinity for FcRn may be increased beyond that of wild type in WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 10o741 [oo75] some instances. This increased affinity may reflect an increased "on" rate, a decreased "off' rate or both an increased "on" rate and a decreased "off" rate. Mutations believed to impart an increased affinity for FcRn include, e.g., T256A, T307A, E380A, and N434A (Shields et al. 2001, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The Fc (or Fc portion of a chimeric polypeptide) may be at least 90% or 95% identical to the Fc amino acid sequence shown in Table 2 (amino acids 1439 to 1665 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 2333 to 2559 of SEQ ID NO:6; amino acids 741 to 967 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 746 to 972 ofSEQ ID NO:10; amino acids 685 to 924 of SEQ ID NO:12). The Fc (or Fc portion of a chimeric polypeptide) may be identical to the Fc amino acid sequence shown in Table 2 (amino acids 1439 to 1665 of SEQ ID NO:2; amino acids 2333 to 2559 of SEQ ID NO:6; amino acids 741 to 967 of SEQ ID NO:8; amino acids 746 to 972 of SEQ ID NO: 10; amino acids 685 to 924 of SEQ ID NO: 12). "Hybrid" polypeptides and proteins, as used herein, means a combination of a chimeric polypeptide with a second polypeptide. The chimeric polypeptide and the second polypeptide in a hybrid may be associated with each other via protein-protein interactions, such as charge-charge or hydrophobic interactions. The chimeric polypeptide and the second polypeptide in a hybrid may be associated with each other via disulfide or other covalent bond(s). Hybrids are described in WO 2004/101740 and WO 2006/074199, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. See also US Patent Nos. 7,404,956 and 7,348,004, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The second polypeptide may be a second copy of the same chimeric potypeptide or it may be a non-identical chimeric polypeptide. See, e.g., Figure 1, Example 1, and Table 2. In preferred embodiments, the second polypeptide is a polypeptide comprising an Fc. In preferred embodiments, the chimeric polypeptide is a chimeric Factor VIII-Fc polypeptide and the second polypeptide consists essentially of Fc, e.g, the hybrid polypeptide of Example 1, which is a rFVIIIFc recombinant fusion protein consisting of a single molecule of recombinant B-domain deleted human FVIII (BDD-rFVIII) fused to the dimeric Fc domain of the human IgG1, with no intervening linker sequence. This hybrid polypeptide is referred to herein as FVIIIFc monomeric Fc fusion protein, FVIIIFc monomer hybrid, monomeric FVIIIIFc hybrid, and FVIIIFc WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 10076] monomer-dimer. See Example 1, Fig. 1, and Table 2A. The Examples provide preclinical and clinical data for this hybrid polypeptide. The second polypeptide in a hybrid may comprise or consist essentially of a sequence at least 90% or 95% identical to the amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(ii) without a signal sequence (amino acids 1 to 227 of SEQ ID NO:4) or at least 90% or 95% identical to the amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(ii) with a signal sequence (amino acids -20 to 227 of SEQ ID NO:4). The second polypeptide may comprise or consist essentially of a sequence identical to the amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(ii) without a signal sequence (amino acids 1 to 227 of SEQ ID NO:4) or identical to the amino acid sequence shown in Table 2A(ii) with a signal sequence (amino acids -20 to 227 of SEQ ID NO:4). Figure 1 is a schematic showing the structure of a B domain deleted factor VIII-Fc chimeric polypeptide, and its association with a second polypeptide that is an Fc polypeptide. To obtain this hybrid, the coding sequence of human recombinant B-domain deleted VIII was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from human liver poly A RNA (Clontech) using FVIIl-specific primers. The FVIII sequence includes the native signal sequence for FVIII. The B-domain deletion was from serine 743 ($743; 2287 bp) to glutamine 1638 (Q1638; 4969 bp) for a total deletion of 2682 bp. Then, the coding sequence for human recombinant Fc was obtained by RT-PCR from a human leukocyte cDNA library (Clontech) using Fc specific primers. Primers were designed such that the B-domain deleted FVIII sequence was fused directly to the N-terminus of the Fc sequence with no intervening linker. The FVIIIFc DNA sequence was cloned into the mammalian dual expression vector pBUDCE4.1 (Invitrogen) under control of the CMV promoter. A second identical Fc sequence including the mouse Igk signal sequence was obtained by RT-PCR and cloned downstream of the second promoter, EF 1 ût, in the expression vector pBUDCE4.1. The rFVIIIFc expression vector was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293H; Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Stable clonal cell lines were generated by selection with Zeocin (Invitrogen). One clonal cell line, 3C4-22 was used to generate FVIIIFc for characterization in vivo. Recombinant FVIIIFc was produced and purified (McCue et al. 2009) at Biogen Idec (Cambridge, MA). The transfection strategy described above was WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 [oo791 Ioo8o1 expected to yield three products, i.e., monomeric rFVIIIFc hybrids, dimeric rFVIIIFc hybrids and dimeric Fc. However, there was essentially no dimeric rFVIIIFc detected in the conditioned medium from these cells. Rather, the conditioned medium contained Fc and lnonomeric rFVIIIFc. It is possible that the size of dimeric rFVIIIFc was too great and prevented efficient secretion from the cell. This result was beneficial since it rendered the purification of the monomer less complicated than if all three proteins had been present. The material used in these studies had a specific activity of approximately 9000 IU/mg. "Dosing interval," as used herein, means the amount of time that elapses between multiple doses being administered to a subject. The comparison of dosing interval may be carried out in a single subject or in a population of subjects and then the average obtained in the population may be calculated. The dosing interval when administering a chimeric Factor VIII polypeptide, e.g., a chimeric Factor VIII-Fc potypeptide (a polypeptide comprising a Factor VIII or a hybrid) of the invention may be at least about one and one-half times longer than the dosing interval required for an equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without the non-Factor VIII portion, e.g., without the Fc portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII). The dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half to six times longer, one and onehalf to five times longer, one and one-half to four times longer, one and one-half to three times longer, or one and one-half to two times longer, than the dosing interval required for an equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without the non-Factor VIII portion, e.g., without the Fc portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII). The dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half, two, two and one-half, three, three and one-halt four, four and one-half, rive, five and one-half or six times longer than the dosing interval required for an equivalent amount of said Factor VIII without the non-Factor VIII portion, e.g., without the Fc portion (a polypeptide consisting of said Factor VIII).. The dosing interval may be about every rive, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, or fourteen days or longer. The dosing interval may be at least about one and one-half to 5, one and one-half, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days or longer. For on-demand treatment, the dosing interval of said chimeric polypeptide or hybrid is about once every 24-36, 24-48, 24-72, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 [oo811 [00821 [oo831 1oo841 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, or 72 hours or longer. Preferably, the effective dose is 25-65 IU/kg (25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 62, 64, or 65 IU/kg) and the dosing interval is once every 3-5, 3-6, 3-7, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 or more days, or three times per week, or no more than three times per week. Preferably, the effective dose is 65 IU/kg and the dosing interval is once weekly, or once every 6-7 days. "Long-acting Factor VIII" is a Factor VIII having an increased half-life (also referred to herein as tl/2, tl/2 beta, elimination half-life and HL) over a reference Factor VIII. The increased half-life of a long-acting Factor VIII may be due to fusion to one or more non-Factor VIII polypeptides such as, e.g., Fc, XTEN or albumin. The increased half-life may be due to one or more modification, such as, e.g., pegylation. Exemplary long-acting Factor VIII polypeptides include, e.g., chimeric Factor VIII polypeptides comprising Fc, chimeric Factor VIII polypeptides comprising XTEN and chimeric Factor VIII polypeptides comprising albumin. Additional exemplary long-acting Factor VIII polypeptides include, e.g., pegylated Factor VIII. The "reference" polypeptide, in the case of a long-acting chimeric Factor VIII polypeptide, is a polypeptide consisting essentially of the Factor VIII portion of the chimeric polypeptide, e.g., the same Factor VIII portion without the Fc portion, without the XTEN portion, or without the albumin portion. Likewise, the reference polypeptide in the case of a modified Factor VIII is the same Factor VIII without the modification, e.g., a Factor VIII without the pegylation. In some embodiments, the long-acting Factor VIII has one or more of the íbllowing properties when administered to a subject: a mean residence time (MRT) (activity) in said subject of about 14-41.3 hours; a clearance (CL) (activity) in said subject of about 1.22-5.19 mL/hour/kg or less; a tl/2beta (activity) in said subject of about 11-26.4 hours; an incremental recovery (K value) (activity; observed) in said subject of about 1.38-2.88 IU/dL per IU/kg; a Vss (activity) in said subject of about 37.7-79.4 mL/kg; and an AUC/dose in said subject of about 19.2-81.7 IU*h/dL per IU/kg.

"On-demand treatment," as used herein, means treatment that is intended to take place over a short course of time and is in response to an existing condition, such as a bleeding episode, or a perceived need such as planned surgery. Conditions that may require on-demand treatment include, e.g., a bleeding episode, hemarthrosis, muscle WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 [00871 [00881 [00891 bleed, oral bleed, hemorrhage, hemorrhage into muscles, oral hemorrhage, trauma, trauma capitis, gastrointestinal bleeding, intracranial hemorrhage, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, intrathoracic hemorrhage, bone fracture, central nervous system bleeding, bleeding in the retropharyngeal space, bleeding in the retroperitoneal space, or bleeding in the illiopsoas sheath. The subject may be in need of surgical prophylaxis, peri-operative management, or treatment for surgery. Such surgeries include, e.g., minor surgery, major surgery, tooth extraction, tonsillectomy, inguinal herniotomy, synovectomy, total knee replacement, craniotomy, osteosynthesis, trauma surgery, intracranial surgery, intra-abdominal surgery, intrathoracic surgery, or joint replacement surgery. Preferably, on-demand treatment resolves greater than 80% (greater than 80%, greater than 81%, greater than 82%, greater than 83%, greater than 84%, greater than 85%, greater than 86%, greater than 87%, greater than 88%, greater than 89%, greater than 90%, greater than 91%, greater than 92%, greater than 93%, greater than 94%, greater than 95%, greater than 96%, greater than 97%, greater than 98%, greater than 99%, or 100%) or 80-100%, 80-90%, 85-90%, 90-100%, 90-95%, or 95-100% of bleeds (e.g., spontaneous bleeds) in a single dose. Preferably, greater than 80% (greater than 81%, greater than 82%, greater than 83%, greater than 84%, greater than 85%, greater than 86%, greater than 87%, greater than 88%, greater than 89%, greater than 90%, greater than 91%, greater than 92%, greater than 93%, greater than 94%, greater than 95%, greater than 96%, greater than 97%, greater than 98%, or 100%) or 80-100%, 8090%, 85-90%, 90-100%, 90-95%, or 95-100% of bleeding episodes are rated excellent or good by physicians after on-demand treatment. Preferably, greater than 5%, (greater than 6%, greater than 7%, greater than 8%, greater than 9%, greater than 10%, greater than 11%, greater than 12%, greater than !3%, greater than 14%, greater than 15%, greater than 16%, greater than 17%, greater than 18%, greater than 19%, greater than 20%), or 520%, 5-15%, 5-10%, 10-20%, or 10-15% of bleeding episodes are rated as fair by physicians after on-demand treatment. "Polypeptide," "peptide" and "protein" are used interchangeably and refer to a polymeric compound comprised of covalently linked amino acid residues. "Polynucleotide" and "nucleic acid" are used interchangeably and refer to a polymeric compound comprised of covalently linked nucleotide residues. Polynucleotides may be DNA, cDNA, RNA, single stranded, or double stranded, vectors, WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 loo9ol 1oo911 plasmids, phage, or viruses. Polynucleotides include, e.g., those in Table 1, which encode the polypeptides of Table 2 (see Table 1). Polynucleotides also include, e.g., fragments of the polynucleotides of Table 1, e.g., those that encode fragments of the polypeptides of Table 2, such as the Factor VIII, Fc, signal sequence, 6His and other fragments of the polypeptides of Table 2. "Prophylactic treatment," as used herein, means administering a Factor VIII polypeptide in multiple doses to a subject over a course of time to increase the level of Factor VIII activity in a subject's plasma. Preferably, the increased level is sufficient to decrease the incidence of spontaneous bleeding or to prevent bleeding, e.g., in the event of an unforeseen injury. Preferably, during prophylactic treatment, the plasma protein level in the subject does not fall below the baseline level for that subject, or below the level of Factor VIII that characterizes severe hemophilia (<1 IU/dl [1%]). Preferably, the prophylaxis regimen is "tailored" to the individual patient, preferably by determining PK data for each patient and administering Factor VIII of the invention at a dosing interval that maintains a trough level of 1-3% FVIII activity. Adjustments may be made when a subject experiences unacceptable bleeding episodes defined as >2 spontaneous bleeding episodes over a rolling two-month period. In this case, adjustment will target trough levels of 3-5%. Preferably, prophylactic treatment results in prevention and control of bleeding, sustained control of bleeding, sustained protection from bleeding, and/or sustained benefit. Prophylaxis, e.g., sustained protection can be demonstrated by an increased AUC to last measured time point (AUC-LAST) and reduced clearance, resulting in increased terminal tl/2 compared to short acting FVIII. Preferably, prophylaxis is demonstrated by better Cmax, better Tmax, and/or greater mean residence time versus short-acting FVIII. Preferably, prophylaxis results in no spontaneous bleeding episodes within about 24, 36, 48, 72, or 96 hours (e.g., 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 96, 87, 88, 89, 90, 9!, 92, 93, 94, 95, or 96 hours, preferably within 72 hours), after injection (e.g., the last injection). Preferably, prophylaxis results in greater than 30% (e.g., greater than 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 96, WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 [00921 I00931 [00951 [oo961 [0097] 87, 88, 89, or 90%, preferably greater than 50%), mean reduction in annualized bleeding episodes with once weekly dosing (e.g., at 65 IU/kg). "Subject," as used herein means a human or a non-human mammal. Non-human mammals include, e.g., mice, dogs, primates, monkeys, cats, horses, cows, pigs, and other domestic animals and small animals. "Therapeutic dose," as used herein, means a dose that achieves a therapeutic goal, as described herein. The calculation of the required dosage of factor VIII is based upon the empirical finding that, on average, 1 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by approximately 2 IU/dL. The required dosage is determined using the following formula: Required units = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (IU/dL or % of normal) x 0.5 0U/kg per IU/dL) The therapeutic doses that may be used in the methods of the invention are about 10-100 IU/kg, more specifically, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, 60-70, 70-80, 80-90, or 90-100 IU/kg, and more specifically, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or 100 IU/kg. Additional therapeutic doses that may be used in the methods of the invention are about 10 to about 150 IU/kg, more specifically, about 100-110, 110-120, 120-130, 130140, 140-150 IU/kg, and more specifically, about 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, or !50 IU/kg. "Variant," as used herein, refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide differing from the original polynucleotide or polypeptide, but retaining essential properties thereof, e.g., factor VIII coagulant activity or Fc (FcRn binding) activity. Generally, variants are overall closely similar, and, in many regions, identical to the original polynucleotide or polypeptide. Variants include, e.g., polypeptide and polynucleotide fragments, deletions, insertions, and modified versions of original polypeptides. Variant polynucleotides may comprise, or alternatively consist of, a nucleotide sequence which is at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to, for example, the nucleotide coding sequence in SEQ ID NO: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 (the factor VIII portion, the Fc portion, individually or together) or the complementary strand thereto, the nucleotide coding sequence of known mutant and recombinant factor VIII or Fc such as those disclosed in the publications and patents cited herein or the complementary strand thereto, a nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide of SEQ ID WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 (the factor VIII portion, the Fc portion, individually or together), and/or polynucleotide fragments of any of these nucleic acid molecules (e.g., those fragments described herein). Polynucleotides which hybridize to these nucleic acid molecules under stringent hybridization conditions or lower stringency conditions are also included as variants, as are polypeptides encoded by these polynucleotides as long as they are functional. [0098] Variant polypeptides may comprise, or alternatively consist of, an amino acid sequence which is at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% identical to, for example, the polypeptide sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 (the factor VIII portion, the Fc portion, individually or together), and/or polypeptide fragments of any of these polypeptides (e.g., those fragments described herein). [0099] By a nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence at least, for example, 95% "identical" to a reference nucleotide sequence, it is intended that the nucleotide sequence of the nucleic acid is identical to the reference sequence except that the nucleotide sequence may include up to five point mutations per each 100 nucleotides of the reference nucleotide sequence. In other words, to obtain a nucleic acid having a nucleotide sequence at least 95% identical to a reference nucleotide sequence, up to 5% of the nucleotides in the reference sequence may be deleted or substituted with another nucleotide, or a number of nucleotides up to 5% of the total nucleotides in the reference sequence may be inserted into the reference sequence. The query sequence may be, for example, the entire sequence shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 or 3, the ORF (open reading frame), or any fragment specified as described herein. [00100] As a practical matter, whether any particular nucleic acid molecule or polypeptide is at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to a nucleotide sequence or polypeptide of the present invention can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence (reference or original sequence) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, can be determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al. (Comp. App. Biosci. (1990) 6:237-245), which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are both DNA sequences. An RNA sequence can be compared by converting U's to T's. The result of said global sequence alignment is in percent identity. WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB alignment of DNA sequences to calculate percent identity are: Matrix=Unitary, k-tuple=4, Mismatch Penalty=l, Joining Penalty=30, Randomization Group Length=0, Cutoff Score=l, Gap Penalty=5, Gap Size Penalty 0.05, Window Size=500 or the length of the subject nucleotide sequence, whichever is shorter. [00101] If the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence because of 5' or 3' deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction must be made to the results. This is because the FASTDB program does not account for 5' and 3' truncations of the subject sequence when calculating percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the 5' or 3' ends, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of bases of the query sequence that are 5' and 3' of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a nucleotide is matched/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This corrected score is what is used br the purposes of the present invention. Only bases outside the 5' and 3' bases of the subject sequence, as displayed by the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence, are calculated for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. [00102] For example, a 90 base subject sequence is aligned to a 100 base query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletions occur at the 5' end of the subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matched/alignment of the first bases at 5' end. The 10 unpaired bases represent 10% of the sequence (number of bases at the 5' and 3' ends not matched/total number of bases in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB program. If the remaining 90 bases were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a 90 base subject sequence is compared with a 100 base query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so that there are no bases on the 5' or 3' of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only bases 5' and 3' of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 query sequence are manually corrected for. No other manual corrections are to made for the purposes of the present invention. [001031 By a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least, for example, 95% "identical" to a query amino acid sequence of the present invention, it is intended that the amino acid sequence of the subject polypeptide is identical to the query sequence except that the subject polypeptide sequence may include up to rive amino acid alterations per each 100 amino acids of the query amino acid sequence. In other words, to obtain a polypeptide having an amino acid sequence at least 95% identical to a query amino acid sequence, up to 5% of the amino acid residues in the subject sequence may be inserted, deleted, (indels) or substituted with another amino acid. These alterations of the reference sequence may occur at the amino or carboxy terminal positions of the reference amino acid sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among residues in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference sequence. [00104] As a practical matter, whether any particular polypeptide is at least 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99% identical to, for instance, the amino acid sequences of SEQ ID NO:2 (the factor VIII portion, the Fc portion, individually or together) or 4, or a known factor VIII or Fc polypeptide sequence, can be determined conventionally using known computer programs. A preferred method for determining the best overall match between a query sequence (reference or original sequence) and a subject sequence, also referred to as a global sequence alignment, can be determined using the FASTDB computer program based on the algorithm of Brutlag et al., Comp. Appo BioscL 6:237245(1990), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In a sequence alignment the query and subject sequences are either both nucleotide sequences or both amino acid sequences. The result of said globa! sequence alignment is in percent identity. Preferred parameters used in a FASTDB amino acid alignment are: Matrix=PAM 0, k-tuple=2, Mismatch Penalty=l, Joining Penalty=20, Randomization Group Length=0, Cutoff Score=l, Window Size=sequence length, Gap Penalty=5, Gap Size Penalty=0.05, Window Size=500 or the length of the subject amino acid sequence, whichever is shorter. [00105] If the subject sequence is shorter than the query sequence due to Nor C-terminal deletions, not because of internal deletions, a manual correction must be made to the results. This is because the FASTDB program does not account for Nand C-terminal WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 truncations of the subject sequence when calculating global percent identity. For subject sequences truncated at the Nand C-termini, relative to the query sequence, the percent identity is corrected by calculating the number of residues of the query sequence that are Nand C-terminal of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned with a corresponding subject residue, as a percent of the total bases of the query sequence. Whether a residue is matched/aligned is determined by results of the FASTDB sequence alignment. This percentage is then subtracted from the percent identity, calculated by the above FASTDB program using the specified parameters, to arrive at a final percent identity score. This final percent identity score is what is used for the purposes of the present invention. Only residues to the Nand C-termini of the subject sequence, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence, are considered for the purposes of manually adjusting the percent identity score. That is, only query residue positions outside the farthest Nand C-terminal residues of the subject sequence. [00106] For example, a 90 amino acid residue subject sequence is aligned with a residue query sequence to determine percent identity. The deletion occurs at the Nternfinus of the subject sequence and therefore, the FASTDB alignment does not show a matching/alignment of the first 10 residues at the N-ternlinus. The 10 unpaired residues represent 10% of the sequence (number of residues at the Nand Ctermini not matched/total number of residues in the query sequence) so 10% is subtracted from the percent identity score calculated by the FASTDB prograln. If the remaining 90 residues were perfectly matched the final percent identity would be 90%. In another example, a residue subject sequence is compared with a 100 residue query sequence. This time the deletions are internal deletions so there are no residues at the Nor C-termini of the subject sequence which are not matched/aligned with the query. In this case the percent identity calculated by FASTDB is not manually corrected. Once again, only residue positions outside the Nand C-terminal ends of the subject sequence, as displayed in the FASTDB alignment, which are not matched/aligned with the query sequence are manually corrected tbr. No other manual corrections are to made for the purposes of the present invention. [00107] The polynucleotide variants may contain alterations in the coding regions, noncoding regions, or both. Especially preferred are polynucleotide variants containing alterations which produce silent substitutions, additions, or deletions, but do not alter the WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 properties or activities of the encoded polypeptide. Nucleotide variants produced by silent substitutions due to the degeneracy of the genetic code are preferred. Moreover, variants in which 5-10, 1-5, or 1-2 amino acids are substituted, deleted, or added in any combination are also preferred. Polynucleotide variants can be produced for a variety of reasons, e.g., to optimize codon expression for a particular host (change codons in the human mRNA to those preferred by a bacterial host such as E. coli). [00108] Naturally occurring variants are called "allelic variants," and refer to one of several alternate forms of a gene occupying a given locus on a chromosome of an organism (Genes II, Lewin, B., ed., John Wiley & Sons, New York (1985)). These allelic variants can vary at either the polynucleotide and/or polypeptide level and are included in the present invention. Alternatively, non-naturally occurring variants may be produced by mutagenesis techniques or by direct synthesis. [00109] Using known methods of protein engineering and recombinant DNA technology, variants may be generated to improve or alter the characteristics of the polypeptides. For instance, one or more amino acids can be deleted from the N-terminus or C-terminus of the secreted protein without substantial loss of biological function. The authors of Ron et al., Ji Biol. Chem. 268:2984-2988 (1993), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, reported variant KGF proteins having heparin binding activity even after deleting 3, 8, or 27 amino-terminal amino acid residues. Similarly, Interferon gamma exhibited up to ten times higher activity after deleting 8-10 amino acid residues from the carboxy terminus of this protein. (Dobeli et al., J. Biotechnology 7:199-216 (1988), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.) [00110] Moreover, ample evidence demonstrates that variants often retain a biological activity similar to that of the naturally occurring protein. For example, Gayle and coworkers (J. Biol. Chem 268:22105-22111 (1993), incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) conducted extensive mutational analysis of human cytokine IL-1 a. They used random mutagenesis to generate over 3,500 individual IL-la mutants that averaged 2.5 amino acid changes per variant over the entire length of the molecule. Multiple mutations were examined at every possible amino acid position. The investigators found that "[m]ost of the molecule could be altered with little effect on either [binding or biological activity]." (See Abstract.)

WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 Example 1 Abstract [00115] A recombinant B-domain-deleted factor VIII-Fc (rFVIIIFc) fusion protein was created to extend the half-life of FVIII. rFVIIIFc was studied in mouse and dog models of severe hemophilia A and compared to rFVIII (ReFacto ). Whole blood clotting time (WBCT) in hemophilia A mice was corrected for approximately two to three times longer and the elimination hall-lire in plasma was nearly twice as long for rFVIIIFc compared to ReFacto®. In hemophilia A dogs, an intravenous dose of rFVIIIFc (125 lU/kg) corrected the WBCT to normal. The WBCT remained below 20 min, the time consistent with FVIII:C > 1%, through approximately 96 hr, compared to 48 hr for dogs treated with ReFacto« The elimination half-life of rFVIIIFc in dog plasma, when measured using ELISA or chromogenic activity assays, was 15.7 • 1.7 hr and 15.4 ± 0.3 hr, respectively. ReFacto corrected WBCT for approximately one half as long as rFVIIIFc and the plasma half-life was 7.0 hr. Thus, fusion of FVIII to Fc produced a molecule with an increased plasma half-life and the ability to provide prolonged protection from bleeding. Introduction [00116] Reduced mortality, prevention of joint damage and improved quality of life have been important achievements due to the deve!opment of plasma-derived and recombinant FVIII. Prolonged protection from bleeding would represent another key advancement in the treatment of hemophilia A patients. The inventors have created a recombinant factor VIII-Fc (rFVIIIFc) chimeric protein and hybrid as an approach to extend the half-life of FVIII. [00117] rFVIIIFc is a heterodimeric hybrid protein comprised of B-domain-deleted FVIII fused recombinantly to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) (Fig. 1, SEQ ID NO:2; Table 2A) (This protein is also referred to herein as FVIIIFc monomeric Fc fusion protein, FVIIIFc monomer hybrid, monomeric FVIIIIFc hybrid, and FVIIIFc monomer-dimer.). The Fc enables binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is responsible for protection of IgG from degradation and confers on IgG the three week half-life observed in humans (Ghetie V, and Ward ES., Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000;18:739-766; Roopenian DC, and Akilesh S., Nature Rev. Immunol. 2007;7:715725, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 [00118[ The Fc domain of IgG1 has been fused to growth factors, cytokines, enzymes and ligand-binding regions of receptors (Ashkanazi A, et al., Int. Rev. Immunol. 1993:10:21927; Chamow SM, and Ashkanazi A, Trends Biotechnol. 1996:14:52-60; Fisher et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 1996:334(26): 1697-702, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Several of these have become important therapeutic molecules (e.g. etanercept, alefacept, abatacept). In these fusion proteins, two effector molecules are connected to two Fc molecules. In this example, rFVIIIFc has been constructed as a monomeric Fc fusion protein (one copy of a polypeptide consisting of the sequence in Table 2A(i) (SEQ ID NO:2) with or without the signal sequence and one copy of a polypeptide consisting of the sequence in Table 2A(ii) (SEQ ID NO:4) with or without the signal sequence), i.e., with only one copy of the effector molecule (see Figure 1), and the studies presented herein compare the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of this novel protein to rFVIII in mouse and dog models of hemophilia A. The signal sequence is cleavage during secretion. This protein construct is referred to herein as FVIIÏFc monomeric Fc fusion protein, FVIIIFc monomer hybrid, monomeric FVIIIIFc hybrid, and FVIIIFc monomer-dimer. See Example 1, Fig. 1, Table 2A; and US Patent Nos. 7,404,956 and 7,348,004, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, for the structure and production of this protein. Methods and Materials FVIII Preparations Recombinant FVIIIFc [00119] The coding sequence of human recombinant B-domain deleted FVIII was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from human liver poly A RNA (Clontech) using FVIII-specific primers. The FVIII sequence includes the native signal sequence for VIII. The B-domain deletion was from serine 743 ($743; 2287 bp) to glutamine !638 (Q1638; 4969 bp) for a total deletion of 2682 bp See Example 1, Fig. 1, Table 2A; and US Patent Nos. 7,404,956 and 7,348,004, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, for the structure and production of this protein. [00120] The coding sequence for human recombinant Fc was obtained by RT-PCR from a human leukocyte cDNA library (Clontech) using Fc specific primers. Primers were WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 designed such that the B-domain deleted FVIII sequence was fused directly to the Nterminus of the Fc sequence with no intervening linker. The FVIIIFc DNA sequence was cloned into the mammalian dual expression vector pBUDCE4.1 (Invitrogen) under control of the CMV promoter. A second identical Fc sequence including the mouse Igk signal sequence was obtained by RT-PCR and cloned downstream of the second promoter, EF 1 (z, in the expression vector pBUDCE4.1. [00121] The rFVIIIFc expression vector was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293H; Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Stable clonal cell lines were generated by selection with Zeocin (Invitrogen). One clonal cell line, 3C4-22 was used to generate FVIIIFc for characterization in vivo. Recombinant FVIIIFc was produced and purified (McCue JT, et al., J. Chromatogr. A 2009;7824-7830, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety) at Biogen Idec (Cambridge, MA). The transfection strategy described above was expected to yield three products, i.e., monomeric rFVIIIFc hybrid, dimeric rFVIIIFc hybrid and dimeric Fc. However, there was essentially no dimeric rFVIIIFc detected in the conditioned medium from these cells. Rather, the conditioned medium contained Fc and monomeric rFVIIIFc. It is possible that the size of dimeric rFVIIIFc was too great and prevented efficient secretion from the cell. This result was beneficial since it rendered the purification of the monomer less complicated than if ail three proteins had been present. The material used in these studies had a specific activity of approximately 9000 IU/mg. In addition, these human cells produced higher protein level than other cells that were attempted in this experiment. Recombinant VIII [00122] Recombinant B-domain deleted FVIII (ReFacto®) was purchased from Novis Pharmaceuticals and was prepared according to manufacturer's instructions. ReFacto® (recombinant B-domain deleted VIII) has the same amino acid sequence as amino acids 1 to 1438 ofSEQ ID NO:2. Hemophilia A animais [00123] The hemophilia A mice are FVIII exon 16 knockouts on a 129 x B6 background that were obtained from Dr. Kazazian at the University of Pennsylvania (Bi L, et al., Nat. Genet. 1995;10(1):119-121, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety) and bred at WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 Syntonix. These mice exhibit prolonged whole blood clotting times (>60 min), and are thus a good model of severe hemophilia A. [00124] Hemophilia A dogs were from the in-bred colony maintained at the Francis Owen Blood Research Laboratory at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (Graham, JB, et al., J. Exp. Med. 1949;90:97-111, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). These dogs have a severe hemophilic phenotype comparable to the severe form of the human disease (Graham, JB, et al., J. Exp. Med. 1949;90:97-111; Lozier, JN, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002;99:12991-12996, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Study Designs Hemophilia A Mouse Studies [001251 The effect of rFVIIIFc and ReFacto on whole blood clotting time (WBCT) was studied in FVIII-deficient mice. Each protein was administered intravenously at 50 IU/kg and blood was collected from the tail vein of each mouse pre-dose and various time points post-dosing. The blood samples were incubated in microtubes at 37°C and visually inspected once per minute for the presence of a clot. Time of clot formation was recorded. If no clot formed by 60 min, the clotting time was recorded as >60min. Blood from normal mice clots in approximately 4 rein (range 2-7 min, n = 10 mice) in the WBCT assay. [00126] In a second set of studies, hemophilia A mice were administered a single intravenous dose of 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc, ReFacto » or Advate« (4 mice per time point). Blood was collected by cardiac puncture in one tenth volume 3.2% sodium citrate at 0.25, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hr after dosing. Plasma was prepared and stored at -80°C until analysis for VIII activity using a FVIII-specific chromogenic activity assay. Hemophilia A Dog Studies [00127] In a single dose PK/PD study of rFVIIIFc, two hemophilia A dogs from the Chapel Hill colony were administered a single intravenous dose of 125 IU/kg and blood samples were collected pre-dose and after dosing at selected time points for WBCT, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), FVIIIFc plasma concentration, hematology and serum chemistry. Time points for WBCT included pre-dose, 5 and 30 min and 1, 2, WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 4, 8, 24, 32, 48, 72, 96, 144, and 168 hr after dosing. Blood collections tbr clotting activity (aPTT) and FVIIIFc plasma concentration included the time points listed above for WBCT as well as 15 min and 3, 6, 12 hours after dosing. [00128] A second study was conducted in which ReFacto® (114 IU/kg for dog Ml2 and t20 IU/kg for dog M38) was administered intravenously. WBCT was measured until clotting times were > 20 rein (consistent with FVIII:C > 1%), and then 125 IU/kg rFVIIIFc was administered intravenously to the same dogs and blood samples were collected for WBCT, aPTT, FVIIIFc plasma concentration, hematology and serum chemistry. Time points for WBCT included pre-dose, 5 and 30 min and 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 32, 48, 72 hr after dosing. Blood was also collected at 96, 120, 144, and 168 hr after dosing with FVIIIFc. Blood collections for clotting activity and FVIIIFc plasma concentration included the time points listed above for WBCT as well as 15 min and 3, 6, 12 hours after dosing. [00129] The WBCT procedure in hemophilia A dogs was slightly different than that in the hemophilia A mice. After dosing with rFVIIIFc or ReFacto®, one mL of blood was collected at various time points and 0.5 mL was distributed into two siliconized glass tubes which were subsequently placed into a 28°C water bath. Beginning at one minute, one tube was tilted every 30 sec, the second left undisturbed. When a clot formed in the tilted tube, the second tube was then tilted every 30 sec until a clot formed. The time for a fully gelled clot in the second tube was recorded as the WBCT. FVIII activity in plasma Measurement of VIII activity in plasma by FVIII-specific chromogenic assay [00130] Plasma samples were tested for FVIII activity by an automated chromogenic method using a Sysmex CA1500 instrument and reagents were from Siemans Healthcare Diagnostics (Dallas, TX, kit #B4238-40). Activity of rFVIIIFc was determined using a standard curve created using the 7th International Standard Factor VIII Concentrate (NIBSC code 99/678) spiked into human FVIII-depleted plasma (Stago USA) at concentrations ranging from 1.5 -0.016 lU/mL. WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 Measurement of rFVIIIFc or VIII by ELISE FVIIIFc in dog plasma by ELISE [00131] A FVIII antibody specific to the A1 domain (Green Mountain Antibodies: GMA8002) was coated on 96 well plates and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. The coated plates were blocked with Tris-buffered saline comaining Tween 20, CaC12 and bovine serum albumin for 1 hr at room temperature and then standards, controls and samples that were prepared in normal dog plasma, were diluted 1:10 and then added to the plates and incubated for 1 hour at 37°C. The plates were washed and then donkey (F(ab)'2 ) antihuman Fc-HRP (Jackson: 709-036-098) was added and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. After washing, TMB (BioFx supersensitive substrate: TMBS-0100-01) was added to the plates, the substrate reaction was quenched with acid and absorbance was measured on a SpectraMax Plus plate reader (Molecular Devices) at 450 nm. ReFacto® in dog plasma by ELISA [00132] An anti-FVIII antibody specific to the A1 domain on the heavy chain (Green Mountain Antibodies: GMA-8002) was coated on 96 well plates and incubated for 2 hr at room temperature. The coated plates were blocked for 1 hr at 37 °C and after washing, the standards, controls and samples were prepared in normal dog plasma then diluted 1 : were added to the plates and incubated for 2 hr at room temperature. The plates were washed then treated with the detection antibody, a pre-diluted anti-FVIII horse radish peroxidase conjugate (Affinity Biologicals: F8C-EIA-D), and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. After washing TMB (BioFx supersensitive substrate: TMBS-010001) was added to the plates for 10 rein. The substrate reaction was quenched with acid and the signal was measured on a SpectraMax Plus plate reader (Molecular Devices) at a wavelength of 450 nm. Measurement of Fibrinogen [00133] The concentration of fibrinogen in plasma was measured at Esoterix (Research Triangle Park, NC) using a kit that contains HemosILTM PT-Fibrinogen-HS reagent (Instrumentation Laboratory, Lexington, MA, Catalog #0008468210) and an ACL 7000 Coagulation Analyzer (Beckman Coulter), according to the manufacturer's instructions. WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 Measurement of Platelets [00134] Platelets were counted in EDTA anti-coagulated whole blood by automated methods using the Vet-ABC-Diff Hematology Analyzer programmed with a species specific smart card (SCIL Animal Care Co., Gurnee, IL)o Pharmacokinetic Analysis [0t)135] The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by noncompartmental analysis using WinNonlin software from Pharsight, version 5.2 (Mountain View, Ca). PK parameters included the maximum concentration in plasma (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), elimination half-life (t1 /2 ), volume of distribution (Vss), and clearance (C1). Results Recombinant FVIII-Fc [00136] rFVIIIFc is a recombinant fusion of human B-domain deleted FVIII with Fc from human IgG1, with no intervening linker sequence (rFVIIIFc; Figure 1). [00137] Purified rFVIIIFc had a specific activity of approximately 9000 IU/mg as determined using a chromogenic activity assay. Recombinant B-domain deleted FVIII (ReFacto ) has a reported specific activity of 9110 - 13700 IU/mg. Conversion of specific activity into IU/nmol to take into account the size difference between FVIIIFc and ReFacto (216 kDa and ! 70 kDa respectively), indicates that the two proteins have approximately equivalent specific activities (1970 IU/nmol for rFVIIIFc and 1521 - 2287 IU/nmol for ReFacto )). Thus the FVIII activity of rFVIIIFc is not affected by fusion of the C-terminus of human FVIII to the N-terminus of human F« Administration to Hemophilia A mice [00138] A single 50 IU/kg dose of rFVIIIFc or ReFacto was administered intravenously to FVIII-deficient mice (n = 6/group). Blood samples were collected pre-dose and after dosing through 120 hr and WBCT determined as described in Materials and Methods. Baseline WBCT were greater than 60 min. Data from a representative experiment are shown in Figure 2 and Table 3. Immediately after dosing with either rFVIIIFc or ReFacto WBCT was corrected to 2-17 minutes. Blood from mice treated with WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 ReFacto' » lost the ability to clot by 42 hr, whereas blood from all mice treated with rFVIIIFc still clotted at 96 hr, the blood from one of six was clotted at 113 hr, but all had lost the ability to clot by 120 hr. These data suggest that the duration of effect for rFVIIIFc is approximately two to three times longer than for ReFacto' [00139] The chromogenic activity of rFVIIIFc, ReFacto or Advate (full-length recombinant FVIII) was studied in the FVIII-deficient mice after a single intravenous dose of 50 IU/kg. Blood was collected pre-dose and after dosing at 8, 24, 48, and 72 hr. The activity was measured using a FVIII-specific chromogenic activity assay and is shown in Figure 3. The pharmacokinetic parameters are reported in Table 4. The circulating half-life for rFVIIIFc was approximately 1.6 to 2 fold longer (11.1 hr) compared to Advate * (7 hi') and ReFacto (5 hr). The Cmax was 1.6 + 0.36 lU/mL for rFVIIIFc compared to 0.47 ± 0.30 IU/mL for Advate » and 0.67 40.44 IU/mL for ReFacto The systemic exposure of rFVIIIFc was markedly greater for rFVIIIFc (22.6 hr-IU!mL) compared to ReFactoç > (6.94 hr-IU/mL) and Advate (3.90 hr-IU/mL) and clearance for rFIIIFc was notably lower (2.09 mL/hr/kg) compared to both ReFacto (7.2 mL/hr/kg) and Advate' (12.8 hr/mL/kg) in the hemophilia A mice. Administration to Hemophilia A dogs 100140] The pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of rFVIIIFc were studied in ti1 e Chapel Hill colony of hemophilia A dogs. A single intravenous dose of 125 IU/kg rFVIIIFc was administered to each of four hemophilia A dogs and the WBCT was immediately corrected to normal (Figure 4). The range of WBCT in normal dogs is 8-12 min. The WBCT remained bellow 20 nain, the time consistent with FVIII:C >1%, through approximately 96 hr with the exception of one dog that had WBCT <20 min through 72 hr. In addition, aPTT was also immediately corrected to normal (Table 6). The concentration of rFVIIIFc in plasma »vas measured using a specific ELISE which was designed to detect both the VIII and Fc portions of the molecule. The plasma concentration versus time curves are shown in Figure 5. PK analysis of the data showed that the t1 /2 was 15.7 41.7 hr (Table 5). Similar results were obtained when rFVIIIFc was measured using a FVIII-specific chromogenic activity assay (h/2 = 15.4 40.3 hr, Table 5) and the plasma concentration versus time curves were similar using both methods (Figures 5 and 6). When the activity data were converted from IU/mL to ng/mL using the WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 specific activity for rFVIIIFc, there was a good correlation with the ELISE data, thereby demonstrating that the protein that was measured by ELISE was fully active. [00141] Two of the dogs treated with rFVIIIFc also received a single dose of ReFacto 114 IU/kg for dog Ml2 and 120 IU/kg for dog M38, 72 hr prior to dosing with rFVIIIFc. WBCT and aPTT were corrected to normal immediately after dosing with ReFacto' However, the WBCT normalization after the single dose of rFVIIIFc lasted approximately twice as long compared to ReFacto' » (Figure 4). Moreover, the plasma hall-lire of rFVIIIFc (15.7 : 1.7 hr) was approximately twice as long for rFVIIIFc compared to ReFacto g (7.0 and 6.7 hr) when the concentration of the proteins in plasma were measured by ELISE (Table 5). Similar results were obtained when the two molecules were measured by FVIII-specific chromogenic activity. [00142] To assess the potential risk of thrombogenicity, platelets and fibrinogen were measured. After dosing with either rFVIIIFc or ReFacto platelet numbers and plasma fibrinogen concentration did not change from pre-dose values (data not shown). Discussìon [00143] Recombinant FVIIIFc was produced in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells from a stably transfected cell line and was purified from cell culture medium. Production in a human cell line represents a significant change in manufacturing compared to currently marketed rFVIII products which are produced in either Chinese Hamster Ovary cells or Baby Hamster Kidney cells. The rationale for this change was that it was expected that the human cells were best equipped to perform the necessary post-translational modifications for the VIII portion of this molecule. [00144] Conversion of the specific activity to IU/nmol to take into account the difference in molecular weights for rFVIIIFc and recombinant B-domain deleted VIII (ReFacto< ) indicated that the specific activities are similar for both proteins (1970 IU/nmol for rFVIIIFc and 1521 - 2287 IU/nmol for ReFactd ). It is somewhat surprising that the specific activity for rFVIIIFc is not affected by fusion of the C terminus of FVIII with the N-terminus of Fc since the C1 and C2 domain of FVIII are involved in phospholipid binding which is essential for full FVIII activity (Fay, P J, J. Hematology 83:103-8 (2006) and Rant, S, et al., Br. J. Haematol. 1.07:323 (1999), each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 [00145] Treatment of hemophilia A is on-demand at the time of a bleeding episode or by prophylaxis for the prevention of bleeding. Although on-demand treatment is still frequently used, there is a trend toward prophylaxis and the prevention of joint damage (Blanchette P, et al., Haemophilia 2004: 10;679-683, Manco-Johnson, M J, et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 2007;357:535-544, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Current VIII products are administered every two to three days for prophylaxis due to the relatively short hall-lire of 10-12 hr in order to maintain a FVIII:C above 1% in patients (Morfini, M, Haemophilia 2003;9 (suppl 1):94-99;discussion 100, White GC, et al., Thromb. Haemost. 1997:77:660-7, Blanchette, P, et al., J. Throb. Haemost. 2008 Aug;6(8): 1319-26, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Longer-acting VIII therapies that provide prolonged protection from bleeding would represent a marked improvement in the quality of life for patients with hemophilia A. Strategies to extend the half-life of clotting factors include those that have been successful for other molecules, including pegylation (Rostin J, et al., Bioconj. Chem. 2000;11:387-96, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety), glycopegylation (Stennicke HR, et al., Thromb. Haemost. 2008;100:920-8, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety), formulation with pegylated liposomes (Spira J, et al., Blood 2006;108:3668-3673, Pan J, et al., Blood 2009;114:2802-2811, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety) and conjugation with albumin (Schulte S., Thromb. Res. 2008;!22 Suppl 4:S14-9, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). Pegylation represents an approach to reduce clearance, however, the effect of the modification in vivo is currently unknown. The outcome of direct pegylation of FVIII on in vivo is currently unknown, whereas VIII formulated with pegylated liposomes has been studied clinically and showed a modest to no effect on bleeding periods (Spira J, et al., Blood 2006;108:3668-3673, Spira J, et al., Thromb. Haemost. 2008 Sep;100(3):42934, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). [00146] The present approach to extend the half-life of VIII was to recombinantly fuse FVIII to the Fc domain of IgG1. Fc binds to the naturally occurring receptor, FcRn, of which the nomaal function is protection of IgG from degradation. The results described herein represent the initial pharmacokinetic and efficacy characterization of rFVIIIFc compared to a rFVIII product in hemophilia A mice and hemophilia A dogs. In both species, the hall-lire of rFVIIIFc was approximately twice that of rFVIII when measured WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 by FVIII activity or ELISA (dogs only). These data also correlated well with the WBCT results from both animal models, i.e. the duration of the effect of rFVIIIFc on WBCT was approximately twice as long compared to ReFacto In dogs, the Cmax and clearance were similar for rFVIIIFc and ReFacto<g), but the AUC and volume of distribution at steady state were approximately 1.5 fold and 2 fold greater for rFVIIIFc compared to ReFacto ), respectively. The PK parameters for ReFacto' ) in this animal model are consistent with the values reported in the literature (Brinkhous K, et al., Sem. Thromb. Haemost. 2002;28:269-272, incorporated by reference herein in its entirety). [00147] If these findings translate to the same extension of half-life in humans, this could represent a significant advancement in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.

The specific activity is 8235 IU/mg. Storage was at - 70°C. It was diluted prior to injection. [00161] Name: Xyntha (Novis Pharmaceuticals), Supplied as a lyophilized powder which was reconstituted according to the manufacturer's instructions to produce a solution with a nominal concentration of 525 IU/mL. Storage was according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Animais [00162] Cynomolgus monkeys from the New Iberia Research Center (NIRC) colony were used, and the study (NIRC Study # 8733-0903) was conducted under an approved NIRC IACUC protocol (APS 2008-8733-058) at NIRC in New Iberia, LA. [00163] Six naïve cynomolgus monkeys (three males, three females) that were determined to be in good health were used in the study. [00164] The study was performed in compliance with the protocol and UL LafayetteNIRC Standard Operating Procedures. Study Design [00165] rFVIIIFc was administered intravenously at 125 lU/kg to each of six monkeys (three males, three females). Xyntha (BDD-rFVIII) was administered intravenously to the same animals at 125 IU/kg in a crossover design. Group 1 animals (n = 3) received Xyntha on Day 0 and rFVIIIFc on Day 3, while Group 2 animals (n = 3) received rFVIIIFc on Day 0 followed by Xyntha on Day 4. The additional day between doses for group 2 was to ensure that the rFVIIIFc had sufficient time to decrease below projected baseline levels. Blood was collected for plasma in one-tenth volume 3.2 % sodium citrate from each animal predose and after dosing at 0.25, 4, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 hr for measurement of rFVIIIFc or Xyntha by ELISE and a FVIII-specific chromogenic activity assay. WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 ELISA to measure rFVIIIFc and VIII in plasma Method to Measure rFVIIIFc in Monkey Plasma [00166] This Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) is designed to quantify rFVIIIFc in monkey plasma. In this ELISE method, goat anti-human IgG-(H+L) antibody (monkey absorbed) from Bethyl Laboratories (Cat#A80-319A) is diluted in Coating Buffer and immobilized onto a 96-well microtiter sample plate. The plate is aspirated, and ail un-adsorbed sites are blocked with the addition of Blocking Buffer (3% BSA/lxTris) for approximately 2 hours at 37°C. Plasma samples are dilnted 1:20 with High Calcium Sample Dilution Buffer (3% Non-Fat Dry Milk!TBST with 30 mM CaC12) and dispensed onto the sample plate. Plates are incubated for approximately 2 hours at 37°C. The plate is subsequently washed and mouse anti-B domain-deleted («.BDDA1) Factor VIII (Al domain) antibody from Green Mountain Antibodies (Cat#GMA-8002) is added to the plate and incubated for approximately 1 hour at 37°C. After washing the plate, HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2a antibody from Southern Biotech (Cat#1080-05) is added to the plate and incubated for approximately 30 minutes at room temperature. The plate is washed again and a tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) peroxidase substrate solution is added and incubated for approximately 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction is stopped by addition of a non-acidic Stop Solntion. Color develops in proportion to the amount of rFVIIIFc in the sample. Plates are read on an absorbance plate reader using a single detection wavelength, 650 nm. rFVIIIFc concentrations are determined on a standard curve obtained by plotting optical density (OD) versus concentration using a four-parameter logistic curve-fitting program. The calibration curve range of this method is 0.400 ng/mL - 51.2 ng/mL in 5% monkey plasma (8.00 ng/mL - 1024 ng/mL in 100% monkey plasma). One calibrator onside the qualified range of the assay at 0.200 ng/mL in 5% monkey plasma may be included to serve as an anchor point to facilitate curve-fitting. The anchor point is removed or retained based on the best fit of the curve (i.e., the highest number of standards read within defined accuracy, %RE). Method to Measure FVIII in Monkey Plasma [00167] This Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay (ELISA) is designed to quantify FVIII in monkey plasma. In this ELISA method, mouse ctBDDA1 FVIII antibody from WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 Green Mountain Antibodies (Cat# GMA-8002) is diluted in Coating Buffer and immobilized onto a 96-well microtiter sample plate. The plate is aspirated, and all unadsorbed sites are blocked with the addition of Blocking Buffer (3% BST/lxTris) for approximately 1 hour at 37°C. Plasma samples are diluted 1:20 with High Calcium Sample Dilution Buffer (Blocking Buffer with 100 mM CaC12) and dispensed onto the sample plate. Plates are incubated for approximately 2 hours at 37°C. After washing the plate, a Detecting Antibody from the Affinity Biologicals Kit, an HRP labeled polyclonal antibody (Cat#FSC-EIA-D), is further diluted in TBS/0.05% Tween 20, and added to the plate and incubated for approximately 1 hour at room temperature. The plate is washed again and a tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) peroxidase substrate solution is added and incubated for approximately 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction is stopped by addition acidic Stop Solution. Color develops in proportion to the amount of FVIIIFc in the sample. Plates are read on an absorbance plate reader using a single detection wavelength, 450 nm. FVIII concentrations are determined on a standard curve obtained by plotting optical density (OD) versus concentration using a four-parameter logistic curve-fitting program. The calibration curve range of this method is 0.625 ng/mL - ng/mL in 5% monkey plasma (12.5 ng/mL - 400 ng/mL in 100% monkey plasma). Two calibrators outside the qualified range of the assay at 0.313 and 0.156 ng/mL in 5% monkey plasma may be included to serve as anchor points to facilitate curve-fitting. The anchor points can be removed or retained based on the best fit of the curve (i.e., the highest number of standards read within defined accuracy, %RE). FVIII-Specific Chromogenic Assay [00168] FVIII activity in cynomolgus monkey plasma samples was estimated based on administered dose, and then diluted to approximately 0.25 - 1 IU/ml in human FVIIIdepleted plasma (Diagnostica Stago). Samples were analyzed in a Sysmex CA1500 (Siemens Diagnostic Healthcare) using a FVIII chromogenic kit (Siemens). In this chromogenic assay, rFVIIIFc in the plasma samples is activated by thrombin. Activated Factor VIII (FVIIIa) then accelerates the conversion of Factor X (FX) to Factor Xa (FXa) in the presence of activated Factor IX (FIXa), phospholipids (PL) and calcium ions. The FXa activity is assessed by hydrolysis of a p-nitroanilide substrate specific to FXa. The initial rate of release of p-nitroaniline (pNA) measured at 405 nm is proportional to the FXa activity, and thus to the VIII activity in the sample. The limit of quantitation of WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 FVIII activity due to rFVIIIFc in this assay is - 0.3 IU/ml. The assay can measure total FVIII activity down to a lower limit of approximately 0.06 IU/ml with an accuracy of 420%. The calculated activity of the pre-dose sample for individual animals was subtracted from the value at each time point to generate the PD curves (VIII activity vs. time). [0@1691 A standard curve was generated from the NIBSC 7th International Standard VIII concentrate diluted to 1 lU/ml in human FVIII-deficient plasma. Standard curves were diluted serially in the Sysmex instrument to yield concentrations of 0.15, 0.1, 0.05, 0.025, 0.0053 and 0.0026 IU/ml. Since the instrument dilutes all samples 1:10 internally, the FVIII standard concentrations correspond to plasma concentrations of 1.5 - 0.026 IU/ml, which is the range of FVIII activities that can be measured. PK analysis [00170] The concentration time profiles were evaluated using the non-compartmental analysis module in the WinNonlin software program (Version 5.2, Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA). RESULTS [00171] The concentration of rFVIIIFc in monkey plasma was measured using a sandwich ELISE format that measured both the FVIII and Fc portions of the molecule and the data are reported in Table 7. All predose samples were below the limit of quantitation. Figure 7 illustrates the group mean rFVIIIFc and Xyntha plasma concentrations over time and individual plasma concentration versus time curves are shown in Figure 8. A summary of the PK parameters for rFVIIIFc and Xyntha are shown in Tables 9 and 10, respectively. The mean tl/2 for rFVIIIFc was 11o9 i 1.7 hr (range 9.3 to 14.1 hr) and for Xyntha, the mean elimination tl/2 was 12.7 ± 4.4 hr (range 9.2 to 19.9 hr). [00172] FVIII activity was measured using a FVIII-specific chromogenic activity assay and the data are reported in Table 8. Pre-dose activity due to endogenous FVIÏI was subtracted from all samples. A graph of the mean group data is shown in Figure 9 and the individual plasma concentration vs. time curves are shown in Figure 10. A summary of the PK parameters are reported for rFVIIIFc and Xyntha in Tables 9 and 10, respectively. The mean elimination tl/2 was 16.1 + 6.9 hr (range 11.6 to 29.4 hr) for rFVIIIFc and 12.5 ± 1.7 hr (range 10.4 to 14.3 hr) for Xyntha. WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 Discussion and Conclusions [00173] The elimination half-lives were similar for rFVIIIFc and Xyntha after a single intravenous dose of 125 IU/kg. whether the test article was measured by ELISA or a chromogenic activity assay. Example 3 [00174] This will be a Phase I/IIa, open-label, crossover, dose-escalation, multi-center, and first-in-human study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of a single dose of rFVIIIFc in subjects with severe (defined as <1 IU/dL [1%] endogenous factor VIII [FVIIÏ]) hemophilia A. A total of approximately 12 previously treated patients will be enrolled and dosed with rFVIIIFc at 25 or 65 IU/kg. After the screening (scheduled within 28 days prior to the first dose of the Advate® [rFVIII], the reference comparator agent) and a minimum of 4-days (96 hours) elapsing with no FVIII treatment prior to the first injection, approximately 6 subjects will receive a single 25 IU/kg dose of Advate® followed by a 3-day (72 hours) pharmacokinetic (PK) profile then crossover and receive a 25 lU/kg single, open-label dose of rFVIIIFc for a 7-day (168 hours) PK profiling. The first 3 subjects will be dosed sequentially. For the first three (3) subjects dosed with 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc, each subject will undergo an inhibitor assessment at 14-days (336 hours) post-injection of rFVIIIFco Dosing of the next subject (for the first three subjects only) will occur once the inhibitor testing is completed. After the 3rd subject completed the 14 day inhibitor assessment, the remaining three subjects at lU/kg and the six subjects at 65 IU/kg will begin enrollment sequentially at least 1 day apart within each dose group. [00175] One week after the last subject receives the 25 IU/kg dose of the rFVIIIFc, approximately 6 unique subjects will be recruited for the 65 IU/kg cohort. Each subject in the 65 IU/kg cohort will receive a single 65 IU/kg dose of Advate® followed by a 4day (96 hours) PK profiling then crossover and receive a 65 IU/kg single, open-label dose of rFVIIIFc for a 10-day (240 hours) profiling. If a bleeding episode occurs before the first injection of rFVIIIFc in any cohort, subject's pre-study FVIII product should be used for treatment and an interval of at least 4 days must then pass before receiving the first injection of rFVIIIFc for the PK profile. WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 [00176] All subjects will be followed for a 14-day (336 hours) and 28 day safety evaluation period after administration of rFVIIIFc 25 IU/kg or 65 IU/kg for safety. All subjects will undergo pharmacokinetic sampling preand post-dosing along with blood samples for analysis of VIII activity at designated time points. Example 4 Activity within the Xase Complex [001771 To investigate the binding of the VIII proteins (rBDD FVIII and rFVIIIFc) with FIXa, and measure the ability of these proteins to activate FX, kinetic studies were performed examining these interactions in the context of the Xase complex. This assay involved the formation of the Xase complex with activated FIX and activated rBDD FVIII or rFVIIIFc protein on a phospholipid surface in the presence of calcium, and monitoring the conversion of FX to FXa as measured by cleavage of a chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate. [00178] Briefly, FVIII is first activated with ct-thrombin for 5 min, then mixed with FIXa in the presence of Ca2+, and synthetic phospholipid vesicles (25% phosphatidylserine (PS)/75% phosphatidylcholine (PC)) or platelets. Under conditions described below, FVIIIa and FIXa interact in the presence of a phospholipid surface and calcium ions to form an active Xase complex that mediates the conversion of FX into FXa through proteolytic processing. In turn, FXa cleaves a FXa-specific chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate. The cleaved substrate is chromogenic and therefore the amount of cleaved substrate in a solution is indicative of the amount of FXa generated. This is quantitated by measuring the absorbance of the solution at 405 nm. A. Activatíon of Factor X [00179] The ability of rBDD FVIII and rFVIIIFc to activate FX were studied in the context of the Xase complex as described above. Thrombin-activated VIII proteins were incubated with FIXa and phospholipids in the presence of calcium, then added to different concentrations of FX in the presence of a FX-specific substrate and the rates of FXa generation determined (Figure 11). [001801 Based on these data, the Km and Vmax for the different VIII proteins in the context of the Xase complex were calculated (Chang !997) (Table 11). Data are WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 expressed as the mean of six analyses (3 experiments containing duplicate runs) + the corresponding standard deviation. Based on these data, these proteins (rBDD FVIII and rFVIIIFc) were found to have comparable Km and Vmax values, within the variation of the assay. Therefore, the Xase complex formed with rFVIIIFc behaves similarly to the Xase complex formed with the licensed product rBDD FVIII (ReFacto) with respect to interactions with phospholipids and ability to activate FX. Note that these comparable data also demonstrate that rFVIIIFc is activated to a comparable degree as rBDD FVIII after a short incubation with thrombin. B. Interaction with FIXa [00181] The interaction between rBDD VIII and rFVIIIFc with FIXa were also examined in the context of the Xase complex. The Xase complex was assembled as above, using a fixed amount of FX and varying FIXa levels, and FXa generation rates detemdned (Figure 12). From these data, the Kd value for the Xase complex formed with both of the FVIII proteins to FIXa were determined (Chang 1997). Data are expressed as the mean of six analyses (3 experiments containing duplicate runs) + the corresponding standard deviation (Table 12). Both proteins were found to have similar Kd and Vmax values, indicating that rFVIIIFc has comparable interactions with FIXa as the licensed rBDD FVIII product. Example [00182] Interim pharmacokinetic data for the Phase I/IIa clinical trial discussed in Example 3 demonstrated the following results for FVIIIFc. FVIIIFc had about a 50% increase in systemic exposure (AUCINv), about 50% reduction in clearance (C1), and about 50-70% increase in elimination half-life and MRT compared to ADVATE (full length rFVIII). In addition, FVIIIFc showed increased C168, TBLP1, TBLP3, and TBLP5 values compared to ADVATE. AUCrNF Beta HL C168 dose C1 Area under the concentration-time curve from zero to infinity Elimination phase half-life; also referred to as tl/21 Estimated FVIIIFc activity above baseline at approximately 168 h after Clearance WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 MRT Mean residence time TBLP 1 Model-predicted time after dose when FVIIIFc activity has declined to approximately 1 IU/dL above baseline TBLP3 Model-predicted time after dose when FVIIIFc activity has declined to approximately 3 IU/dL above baseline TBLP5 Model-predicted time after dose when FVIIIFc activity has declined to approximately 5 IU/dL above baseline Example 6 [001831 A recombinant B-domain-deleted thctor VIII-Fc (rFVIIIFc) fusion protein has been created as an approach to extend the half-life of VIII. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of rFVIIIFc were compared to rFVIII in hemophilia A mice. We found that the terminal half-life was twice as long for rFVIIIFc compared to rFVIII. In order to confirm that the underlying mechanis1 n for the extension of half-life was due to the protection of rFVIIIFc by FcRn, the PK were evaluated in FcRn knockout and human FcRn transgenic mice. A single intravenous dose (1125 IU/kg) was administered and the plasma concentration measured using a chromogenic activity assay. The Cmax was similar between rFVIIIFc and rFVIII (XYNTHA®) in both mouse strains. However, while the half-life for rFVIIIFc was comparable to that of rFVIII in the FcRn knockout mice, the half-life for rFVIIIFc was extended to approximately twice longer than that for rFVIII in the hFcRn transgenic mice. These results confirm that FcRn mediates or is responsible for the prolonged halflife of rFVIIIFc compared to rFVIII. Since hemostasis in whole blood measured by rotation thromboelastometry (ROTEM) has been shown to correlate with the efficacy of coagulation factors in bleeding models of hemophilia mice as well as in clinical applications, we sought to evaluate the ex vivo efficacy of rFVIIIFc in the hemophilia A mice using ROTEM. Hemophilia A mice were administered a single intravenous dose of IU/kg rFVIIIFc, XYNTHA® (FVIII) or ADVATE® (FVIII). At 5 minutes post dose, clot fommtion was similar with respect to clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT) and c-angle. However, rFVIIIFc showed significantly improved CT at 72 and 96 hr post dose, and CFT and c-angle were also improved at 96 hrs compared to both XYNTHA® (FVIII) and ADVATE® (FVIII), consistent with prolonged PK of rFVIIIFc. Therefore construction of an Fc fusion of VIII produces a molecule with a defined mechanism of WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 action that has an increased half-life and the potential to provide prolonged protection from bleeding. Example 7 [00184] This Example presents final analysis results for FVIII activity from 16 patients treated with 25 and 65 IU/kg FVIII products. See Examples 3 and [00185] In this Example, rFVIIIFc is a recombinant fusion protein comprised of a single molecule of recombinant B-domain deleted human FVIII (BDD-rFVIII) fused to the dimeric Fc domain of the human IgG1, with no intervening linker sequence. This protein construct is also referred to herein as rFVIIIFc heterodimeric hybrid protein, FVIIIFc monomeric Fc fusion protein, FVIIIFc monomer hybrid, monomeric FVIIIIFc hybrid, and FVIIIFc monomer-dimer. See Example 1, Fig. 1, and Table 2A. [00186] Preclinical studies with rFVIIIFc have shown an approximately 2-fold prolongation of the half-life of rFVIII activity compared to commercially available rFVIII products. The rationale for this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single dose of rFVIIIFc in frozen liquid formulation and provide data on the PK in severe hemophilia A subjects. For this study, 16 evaluable subjects were available for PK evaluation. Single administration of two doses of both rFVIIIFc and Advate at a nominal dose of 25 (n=6) and 65 IU/kg of body weight (n=10) were infused intravenously over approximately 10 minutes. Blood samples for plasma PK assessments were obtained before infusion, as well as up to 10 days after dosing. The PK of FVIII activity for both Advate and rFVIIIFc were characterized in this study using a model-dependent method. OBJECTIVES [00187] The primary objective of this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of single administration of two doses of rFVIIIFc (25 and 65 IU/kg) in previously treated patients (PTPs) aged 12 and above with severe hemophilia A. [00188] The secondary objectives were to determine the pharmacokinetics (PK) parameters determined by pharmacodynamic (PD) activity of VIII over time after a single administration of 25 or 65 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc compared to Advate in one-stage clotting and chromogenic assays. WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 Study Design (See Example 3) [00189] Blood samples were collected for VIII activity PK evaluations at the screening visit (within 28 days prior to dosing Advate); on Day 0 (injection of Advate) pre-injection and at 10 and 30 minutes and 1, 3, 6, and 9 hours post-injection; on Day 1 at 24 hours post-injection of Advate; on Day 2 at 48 hours post-injection of Advate; on Day 3 at 72 hours post-injection of Advate; and on Day 4 at 96 hours post-injection of high dose of Advate (Cohort B only). [00190] Blood samples were collected for VIII activity PK evaluations on the day of rFVIIIFc injection just prior to the administration of rFVIIIFc, at 10 and 30 minutes and 1, 3, 6, and 9 hours post-injection of rFVIIIFc; on Day 1 at 24 hours post-injection of rFVIIIFc; on Days 2 through 5 at 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours post-injection ofrFVIIIFc; on Day 7 at 168 hours post-injection ofrFVIIIFc; on Days 8, 9, and 10 at 192, 216, and 240 hours post-injection of high dose of rFVIIIFc (Cohort B only). VIII activity was also measured at the final study visit (28 days post-injection of îFVIIIFc) at 672 hours postinjection of rFVIIIFc.

Observed group mean (+SE) FVIII activity versus time profiles, sorted by dose level, grouped by compound (one-stage assay, 25 lU/kg (A) and 65 IU/kg (B)) and (chromogenic assay, 25 IU/kg (C) and 65 IU/kg (D)). [00193] Figure 14. Observed group mean (+SE) VIII activity versus time profiles, grouped by dose level and compound (one-stage assay; A) (chromogenic assay; B). Single-Dose Pharmacokinetics (One-Stage Assay) [00194] Observed FVÏII activity increased sharply after the short IV infusion of either Advate or rFVIIIFc, with mean (±SD) model-predicted Cmax values of 56.6 ± 4.74 and 121 ± 18.2 IU/dL for Advate and 55.6 ± 8.18 and 108 ± 16.9 IU/dL for rFVIIIFc for the and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. All Advateand îFVIIIFc-treated patients had dose-related increases in VIII activity. The observed increase in both Cmax and AUCINF »vas slightly less than proportional to dose over the dose range evaluated. [00195] After the end of the infusion, the decline of the observed FVIII activity exhibited monoexponential decay characteristics until the baseline level was reached. The rate of decline in VIII activity was slower for rFVIIIFc than for Advate with mean (±SD) model-predicted elimination half-life values of 11.9 ± 2.98 and 10.4 ± 3.03 hr for Advate and 18.0 ± 3.88 and 18.4 + 6.99 hr for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. Elimination half-life values appeared to be dose-independent over the dose range evaluated for both VIII products. [00196] Total systemic VIII exposure (assessed by AUCINF) was - 48% and 61% greater following rFVIIIFc administration than Advate at 25 and 65 IU/kg dose levels, respectively. Mean (±SD) model-predicted AUCINF values were 974 ± 259 and 1810 m 606 hr*IU/dL for Advate and 1440 ± 316 and 2910 ± 1320 hr*IU/dL for rFVIIIFc for the and 65 lU/kg dose groups, respectively. [00197] Similar to elimination half-life, the MRT was prolonged for rFVIIIFc relative to Advate. Mean (±SD) model-predicted MRT values were 17.1 ± 4.29 and 14.9 ± 4.38 hr for Advate and 25.9 ± 5.60 and 26.5 ± 10.1 hr for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. MRT values appeared to be dose-independent over the dose range evaluated for both FVIII products. WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 [00198] In addition, primary PK parameter values for CL and V were determined. CL values for rFVIIIFc only accounted for - 66% of those observed for Advate at equivalent doses. Mean (!SD) model-predicted CL values were 2.70 :t: 0.729 and 4.08 ± 1.69 mL/hr/kg for Advate and 1.80 m 0.409 and 2.69 i 1.25 mL/hr/kg for rFVIIIFc for the and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. V values were comparable between Advate and rFVIIIFc with mean (±SD) model-predicted V values of 43.9 ± 4.27 and 56.1 13.4 mL/kg for Advate and 45.3 + 7.23 and 61.6 410.6 mL/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and lU/kg dose groups, respectively. Slight increases in mean CL and V values were noted with increasing dose of Advate and rFVIIIFc; however, the increase in standard deviations at the 65 lU/kg dose coupled with limited dose levels confounded an assessment of the dose-dependency of these parameters. For example, the CV% geometric mean CL value for the rFVIIIFc treatment group increased from 23.0% (25 IU/kg) to 48.6% (65 IU/kg). [00199] In addition to the primary PK parameters, secondary PK parameters (e.g. Kvalues, IVR, etc.) were determined to evaluate FVIII duration of effect. Evidence of PK difference was also observed with rFVIIIFc demonstrating increased TBLPland TBLP3 values compared to Advate at equivalent doses. IVR and K-values for Advate and rFVIIIFc appeared to be comparable. A slight increase in TBLP1 and TBLP3 values were observed with increasing dose of Advate and rFVIIIFc. In contrast, slight decreases in mean IVR and K-values were noted with increasing dose of Advate and rFVIIIFc. As previously indicated, an assessment of the dose dependency of these parameters is confounded by limited dose levels. [00200] Mean (±SD) observed TBLP1 were 2.88 -40.733 and 2.93 i 0.848 IU/dL per IU/kg for Advate and 4.28 ± 0.873 and 5.16 ± 2.02 IU/dL per lU/kg for rFVIIIFc for the and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. Mean ( SD) observed TBLP3 were 2.06 ± 0.527 and 2.26 ± 0.666 IU/dL per IU/kg for Advate and 3.09 ± 0.623 and 3.93 : 1.59 IU/dL per IU/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. [00201] Mean IVR and K-values calculated using observed Cmåx values (subtracted with baseline and residual drug within the model) were generally greater than values determined using model-predicted Cmax values; consistent with slight underestimation of the observed peak activity using the one-compartment model. Mean (iSD) observed Kvalues were 2.57 i 0.198 and 2.13 ± 0.598 IU/dL per lU/kg for Advate and 2.46 0.330 WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 and 1.85 40.332 IU/dL per IU/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. Mean (±SD) observed IVR values were 94.1 + 15.6 and 85.8 ± 16.5 % for Advate and 89.5 ± 11.9 and 74.8 ± 6.72 % for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 lU/kg dose groups, respectively. Single-Dose Pharmacokinetícs (Chromogenic Assay) [00202] Observed FVIII activity increased sharply after the short IV infusion of either Advate or rFVIIIFc, with mean (±SD) model-predicted Cmax values of 70.2 ± 9.60 and 157 ± 38.6 IU/dL for Advate and 70.3 ± 10.0 and 158 ± 34.7 IU/dL for rFVIIIFc for the and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. [00203] All Advateand rFVIIIFc-treated patients had dose-related increases in VIII activity. The observed increase in both Cmax and AUCINF was slightly less than proportional to dose over the dose range evaluated. ï00204] After the end of the infusion, the decline of the observed FVIII activity exhibited monoexponential decay characteristics until the baseline level was reached. The rate of decline in VIII activity was slower for rFVIIIFc than for Advate with mean (±SD) model-predicted elimination half-life values of 10.7 m 1.98 and 10.3 ± 3.27 hr for Advate and 16.2 m 2.92 and 19.0 ± 7.94 hr for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. Elimination half-life values appeared to be dose-independent over the dose range evaluated for both FVIII products. [00205] Total systemic FVIII exposure (assessed by AUCINF) was - 53% and 84% greater following rFVIIIFc administration than Advate at 25 and 65 IU/kg dose levels, respectively. Mean (±SD) model-predicted AUCINF values were 1080 ± 236 and 2320 ± 784 hr*IU/dL for Advate and 1650 ± 408 and 4280 ± 1860 hr*IU/dL for rFVIIIFc for the and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. [00206] Similar to elimination half-life, the MRT was prolonged for rFVIIIFc relative to Advate. Mean (mSD) model-predicted MRT values were 15.3 m 2.86 and 14.8 ± 4.72 hr for Advate and 23.4 ± 4.22 and 27.3 ± 11.4 hr for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. MRT values appeared to be dose-independent over the dose range evaluated for both VIII products. [00207] In addition, primary PK parameter values for CL and V were determined. CL values for rFVIIIFc only accounted for N 58-66% of those observed for Advate at equivalent doses. Mean (mSD) model-predicted CL values were 2.39 ± 0.527 and 3.21 m WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 1.40 mL/hr/kg for Advate and 1.57 ! 0.349 and 1.86 ± 0.970 mL/hr/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. V values were comparable between Advate and rFVIIIFc with mean (±SD) model-predicted V values of 35.8 + 5.52 and 43.6 411.2 mL/kg for Advate and 35.9 + 6.65 and 42.7 48.91 mL/kg for rFVIIIFc for the and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. Increases in mean CL and V values were noted with increasing dose of Advate and rFVIIIFc; however, the increase in standard deviations at 65 IU/kg coupled with limited dose levels confounded an assessment of the dose-dependency of these parameters. [00208] In addition to the primary PK parameters, secondary PK parameters (e.g. Kvalues, IVR, etc.) were determined to evaluate VIII duration of effect. Evidence of PK difference was also observed with rFVIIIFc demonstrating increased TBLPland TBLP3 values compared to Advate at equivalent doses. IVR and K-values for Advate and rFVIIIFc appeared to be comparable. I00209] A slight increase in TBLP1 and TBLP3 values were observed with increasing dose of Advate and rFVIIIFc. In contrast, slight decreases in mean IVR and K-values were noted with increasing dose of Advate and rFVIIIFc. As previously indicated, an assessment of the dose dependency of these parameters is confounded by limited dose levels. [00210] Mean (iSD) observed TBLP! were 2.70 + 0.511 and 3.09 ± 0.978 IU/dL per IU/kg for Advate and 4.06 i 0.798 and 5.66 ± 2.38 IU/dL per IU/kg for rFVIIIFc for the and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. Mean (±SD) observed TBLP3 were !.98 : 0.377 and 2.39 ± 0.718 IU/dL per lU/kg for Advate and 3.04 + 0.598 and 4.44 i 1.84 IU/dL per IU/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. [00211] Mean IVR and K-values calculated using observed Cmax values (subtracted with baseline and residual drug within the model) were generally greater than values determined using model-predicted Cmax values; consistent with slight underestimation of the observed peak activity using the one-compartment model. Mean (±SD) observed Kvalues were 3.08 i 0.429 and 2.85 i 0.721 IU/dL per IU/kg for Advate and 3.12 ± 0.451 and 2.92 ± 0.985 IU/dL per IU/kg for rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. Mean (iSD) observed IVR values were 112 414.5 and 116 + 26.9 % for Advate and 113 416.3 and 117 + 33.6 % [br rFVIIIFc for the 25 and 65 IU/kg dose groups, respectively. WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 CONCLUSIONS [00212] All Advateand rFVIIIFc-treated patients had comparable dose-related increases in Cmax and AUC1NF over the dose range evaluated. Peak plasma levels of Advate and rFVIIIFc activity were generally observed within the first hour after the end of the infusion and remained detectable for several days after dosing. After the end of infusion, the decline in baseline corrected FVIII activity exhibited monoexponential decay until the baseline was reached for both products. Parameter values for elimination half-life and MRT appeared to be dose-independent over the dose range evaluated for both FVIII products. Slight increases in mean CL and V values were noted with increasing dose of Advate and rFVIIIFc; however, increased intersubject variability at the 65 IU/kg coupled with limited dose levels confounded an assessment of the dose-dependency of these parameters. [00213] Comparison of rFVIIIFc and Advate activity PK revealed an approximate 48-61% (One-Stage Assay) or 53-84% (Chromogenic Assay) increase in systemic exposure, approximate 30-40% reduction in clearance, and an approximate 50-80% increase in both elimination half-life and MRT for rFVIIIFc relative to Advate at comparable doses. Evidence of PK difference was also observed with rFVIIIFc demonstrating increased TBLP 1 and TBLP3 values compared to Advate at equivalent doses. IVR and K-values tbr Advate and rFVIIIFc appeared to be comparable. [00214] The PK parameters obtained from Chromogenic Assay results generally agreed with those from the One-Stage Assay, except that the Chomogenic Assay yielded a higher estimation of exposure parameters (e.g. Cmax, AUCINF, etc.). [002151 With the observed improvements in PK, rFVIIIFc may provide a prolonged protection from bleeding, allowing less frequent injections for individuals with Hemophilia A. Example 8 [00216] On the basis of the interim PK analysis from the first-inhuman study of rFVIII:Fc (Example 3), the A-LONG study was designed. A-LONG is an open label, multi-center evaluation of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of recombinant Factor VIII Fc fusion (FVIII:Fc) in the prevention and treatment of bleeding in previously treated subjects with severe hemophilia A (defined as <! IU/dL [<!%] endogenous VIII). WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 [00217] Approximately 106 subjects will be enrolled into one of three regimens: a tailored prophylaxis regimen (ann 1), a weekly dosing regimen (arm 2), and an on-delnand regimen (arm 3). Arm 1: Tailored Prophylaxis Regimen [00218] Arm 1 will include an overall group and a PK subgroup. Approximately 66 subjects will be enrolled. The initial regimen will be twice weekly at 25 lU/kg on the first day, followed by 50 lU/kg on the fourth day of the week. Subjects will administer rFVIIIFc on this weekly prophylaxis regimen until PK results for rFVIIIFc are available. Base don these results, a tailored prophylaxis regimen will be established for each individual, in which the dose and interval will be determined to maintain a trough level of 1-3% FVIII activity. Each subject will then administer his individually tailored prophylaxis regimen throughout the study. [00219] Subjects will be monitored throughout the study and ongoing dose and interval adjustments will be made. Adjustments will only be made when a subject experiences unacceptable bleeding episodes defined as >2 spontaneous bleeding episodes over a rolling two-month period. In this case, adjustment will target trough levels of 3-5%. Arm 2: Weekly Dosing Regimen [00220] Approximately 20 subjects wi!! be enrolled/randomized and undergo abbreviated rFVIIIFc PK profiling as follows: Washout of at least 96 hours; a single dose of rFVIIIFc IU/kg; Abbreviated sampling beginning on rFVIIIFc Day 0, including pre-injection and 10 (±2) minntes, 3 hours (-415 minutes), 72 (± 2) hours [Day 3], and 96 (± 2) hours [Day 4] from the start of injection. Following the abbreviated PK profiling, subjects will then administer a fixed dose of 65 lU/kg rFVIIIFc every 7 days. Arm 3: On-demand Regimen [00221] A minimum of 10 major surgeries in at least 5 subjects will be evaluated in the study. Major surgery is defined as any surgical procedure (elective or emergent) that involves general anesthesia and/or respiratory assistance in which a major body cavity is penetrated and exposed, or for which a substantial impairment of physical or physiological functions is produced (e.g., laparotomy, thoracotomy, craniotomy, joint replacement, and limb amputation). WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 [00222] For prophylaxis during surgery, subjects will be treated with 35 to 50 IU/kg rFVIIIFc every 12 to 24 hours. Prior to surgery, the physician will review the subject's rFVIIIFc PK profile and assess the dose regimen of Factor VIII replacement generally required for the type of planned surgery and the clinical status of the subject. Recommendation for the appropriate dosing of rFVIIIFc in the surgical treatment period, including any rehabilitation time, will take these factors into consideration. [00223] The primary objectives of this study are (a) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of rFVIIIFc administered as prophylaxis, on-demand, and surgical treatment regimens; and (b) to evaluate the efficacy of rFVIIIFc administered as prophylaxis, on-demand, and surgical treatment regimens. The secondary objectives of this study are (a) to characterize the PK profile of rFVIIIFc and compare the PK of FVIIIFc with the currently marketed product, ADVATE; (b) to evaluate individual responses with FVIIIFc; and (c) to evaluate FVIIIFc consumption. Primary Objectives • To evaluate safety and tolerability of rFVIIIFc administered as prophylaxis, weekly, on-demand, and surgical treatment regimens • To evaluate the efficacy of rFVIIIFc administered as tailored prophylaxis, ondemand, and surgical treatment regimens Secondary Objectives • To characterize the PK profile of rFVIIIFc and compare the PK of rFVIIIFc with the currently marketed product, Advate® ® To evaluate individual responses with rFVIIIFc • To characterize the range of dose and schedules required to adequately prevent bleeding in a prophylaxis regimen; maintain homeostasis in a surgical setting; or to treat bleeding episodes in an on-demand, weekly treatment, or prophylaxis setting o To evaluate rFVIIIFc consumption (e.g., total annualized rFVIIIFc consumption per subject) WO 2011/069164 CA 02782424 2012-05-30 PCT/US2010/059136 Example 9 Clinical ROTEM Assessment [00224] In the study in Example 8, in addition to the measurement of plasma FVIII activity by one-stage activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assay, whole blood rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) has also been explored to assess the improvement in global hemostasis by rFVIIIFc and Advate in 2 subjects, specifically, 1 in the low dose cohort and 1 in the high dose cohort. [00225] rFVIIIFc and Advate appear to be comparably active in clot formation when spiked into subjects' blood prior to rFVIIIFc treatment. The clotting time (CT) was linear with respect to the dose of rFVIIIFc and Advate in the range of approximately 1% of 100% of normal, and the dose response was comparable between rFVIIIFc and Advate in the same subject. [00226] Following dosing with Advate and subsequently rFVIIIFc, citrated whole blood was sampled at various time points and the clot formation following recalcification was monitored by ROTEM. Despite the variable baseline CT due to residue VIII levels prior to Advate or rFVIIIFc dosing, both products effectively corrected the CT to comparable levels 30 minutes post-injection. In addition, the improvement in CT was better sustained at and after 3 hours post-injection of 25 IU/kg of rFVIIIFc relative to Advate in the subject dosed at this low dose. However, the differential improvement of rFVIIIFc versus Advate was much less appreciable at the 65 IU/kg dose.
