Preparation Example 6 : Preparation of 1-(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)ethanone
Preparation Example 6-1 : Preparation of 1-(1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)piperidine-4-carboxylic acid
Isonipecotic acid (5.51 g, 0.022 mol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (110 ml). Di-t-butyl dicarbonate ((Boc)2O) (7.31 g, 0.033 mol) and potassium carbonate (K2CO3) (9.62 g, 0.67 mol) were added to the resulting solution and the solution was stirred at room temperature for 18 hrs. After completion of the reaction by addition of water, the solution was extracted with ethylacetate, washed with distilled water, and dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane/methanol, 10/1) to give the white title compound (7.36 g, 95.0 %).
