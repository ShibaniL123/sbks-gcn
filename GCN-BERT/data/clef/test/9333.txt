Synthesis of Intermediate a-1 (5-phenyl-2-nitroaniline)
190.10 grams (g) (1.10 moles, mol) of 5-chloro-2-nitroaniline, 161.05 g (1.32 mol, 1.2 equivalents, eq) of phenylboronic acid, 2.2 liters (L) of potassium carbonate aqueous solution, and 2.2 L of toluene were stirred under nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting mixture was purged with nitrogen gas for 20 minutes, and 63.56 g (55 mmol, 0.05 eq) of tetrakis-triphenylphosphine palladium(0) was added thereto. The resulting mixture was heated under reflux for 6 hours. After the reaction was completed, the resultant obtained therefrom was cooled, 500 milliliters (mL) of water was added thereto, an extraction process was performed thereon three times by using 500 mL of toluene, a washing process was performed thereon twice by using 500 mL of water and 500 mL of brine, and water was removed therefrom by using sodium sulfate. The resultant obtained therefrom was filtered and concentrated to obtain 410.2 g of a crude product. The crude product was dissolved in toluene, adsorbed on 800 g of amine functionalized silica gel, which is about twice the amount of the crude product (eluent: ethyl acetate/toluene=1/5 (volume to volume, v/v)), and purified by column chromatography using 2,870 g of amine functionalized silica gel, which is about seven times the amount of the crude product, thereby obtaining Intermediate a-1 (yellow solid) (synthesized amount: 210 g, yield: 89%, purity (GC): 98%).
