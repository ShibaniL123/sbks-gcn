TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a resin composition that is excellent in storage stability and is capable of forming a cured film having a low stress and improved adhesiveness with a substrate, and to a method for producing a pattern using this resin composition. BACKGROUND ART With miniaturization in an integrated circuit of a semiconductor, an interlayer insulating film called a “low-k layer” for lowering a dielectric constant has been required. However, since the low-k layer has a void structure, a problem arises that mechanical strength is lowered. In order to protect an interlayer insulating film having such a weak mechanical strength, a cured film formed of a polyimide resin is used. This cured film is required to have properties such as capability of being thick and having a high modulus elasticity. However, due to an increase in thickness and an increase in modulus elasticity, the stress after curing may increase, and problems may arise that transfer or securing of a wafer may not necessarily be conducted smoothly due to significant warpage of a semiconductor wafer. Under such circumstances, development of a cured film having a low stress has been desired. In order to allow a cured film to have a low stress while keeping high thermal resistance and excellent mechanical properties of a polyimide resin, it has been reported that it is effective to decrease the coefficient of thermal expansion by allowing the polyimide skeleton to be rigid and linear. Further, if a resin film is formed to have a large thickness in view of protection of a low-k layer, there is a problem that the transmittance of i-line that is used for forming a pattern in a resin film is lowered, and as a result, formation of a pattern becomes impossible. On the other hand, in order to increase i-line transmittance of a coating film, a method has been proposed to use a polyimide precursor containing fluorine. However, there is a disadvantage that a cured film obtained by curing by heating a polyimide precursor containing fluorine has low adhesiveness to silicon wafer used as a substrate (Patent Documents 1 and 2, for example). Further, in order to attain excellent adhesiveness with silicon wafer, use of 3-isocianatopropyltriethoxysilane as a resin composition has been reported (Patent Document 3, for example). However, there is a problem that the storage stability of the resin composition is lowered due to the presence of an isocyanate group having a high reactivity.

The present invention is not restricted to the embodiments. <Resin Composition> The resin composition of the present invention comprises the following components (a) and (b): (a) a polyimide precursor having a structural unit represented by the following general formula (1) (b) a compound represented by the following general formula (2) wherein R1 is a tetravalent organic group, R2 is a divalent organic group and R3 and R4 are independently a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group or a monovalent organic group having a carbon-carbon unsaturated double bond. wherein R5 is an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R6 is independently a hydroxyl group or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a is an integer of 0 to 3, n is an integer of 1 to 6 and R7 is a group represented by the following general formula (3) or a group represented by the following general formula (4): R8 is an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or a monovalent organic group derived from hydroxyalkylsilane, R9 is an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a monovalent organic group derived from aminoalkylsilane or a heterocyclic group, and R8 and R9 each may have a substituent. The component (B) is an adhesion aid. In the present invention, due to the above-mentioned configuration, a state is attained where a highly reactive isocyanate group is protected. Accordingly, as compared with a case where a conventional adhesion aid is used, a resin composition having excellent storage stability can be obtained. Further, the resulting cured film has a low stress and excellent adhesiveness with a substrate. Hereinbelow, a detailed explanation will be made on each component. Component (a): Polyimide Precursor Having a Structural Unit Represented by the General Formula (1) The resin composition of the present invention comprises (a) a polyimide precursor comprising a structural unit represented by the following general formula (1): wherein R1 is a tetravalent organic group, R2 is a divalent organic group, R3 and R4 are independently a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group, a cycloalkyl group or a monovalent organic group having a carbon-carbon unsaturated double bond. The residual stress of the cured film obtained by applying the polyimide precursor represented by the general formula (1) to a substrate, followed by curing by heating is preferably 30 MPa or less when the film thickness of the cured film is 10 μm, more preferably 27 MPa or less, and further preferably 25 MPa or less. If the residual stress is 30 MPa or less, when a film is formed to have a thickness of 10 μm after curing, wafer warpage can be suppressed more sufficiently, whereby problems that occur during transfer or securing by sucking of a wafer can be suppressed more sufficiently. The residual stress can be measured by a method in which the warpage of a wafer is measured by means of a thin film stress measurement apparatus (FLX-2320, manufactured by KLA Tencor Japan), and the amount of the warpage is converted to a stress. In order to allow the cured film obtained in the present invention to have a thickness of 10 μm after curing, after the step of forming a coating film by applying the resin composition to a substrate and drying, the coating film is required to be formed in a thickness of about 20 μm. Therefore, when a photosensitive resin composition is formed by combining with a compound that generates a radical upon irradiation with active rays, it is important to have a high i-line transmittance. Specifically, in a film thickness of 20 μm, the i-line transmittance is preferably 5% or more, more preferably 8% or more, and further preferably 15% or more, with 30% or more being particularly preferable. If the i-line transmittance is lower than 5%, the i-line does not reach deep inside the film, and radicals are not generated sufficiently, whereby photosensitive properties may be deteriorated; e.g. oozing out of the resin from the substrate of the film at the time of development may occur. The i-line transmittance can be measured by measuring the transmitted UV spectrum by means of a U-3310 spectrophotometer (manufactured by Hitachi, Ltd.). R1 in the general formula (1) is a structure derived from tetracarboxylic dianhydride used as a raw material. In respect of stress of a cured film, R1 is preferably pyromellitic dianhydride, 2,3,6,7-naphthalene tetracarboxylic dianhydride and 3,3′,4,4′-biphenyltetracarboxylic dianhydride.

In particular, in respect of i-line transmittance and easiness in availability, it is more preferred that R2 in the general formula (1) be a divalent organic group represented by the general formula (6). In the component (a), in R2 in the general formula (1), the structural unit represented by the general formula (6) is preferably 1 to 100 mol %, more preferably 10 to 90 mol %, and further preferably 30 to 90 mol %.

[in-line-formulae]R22—OH (13)[/in-line-formulae] wherein R22 is a hydrogen atom, an alkyl group or a monovalent organic group including a carbon-carbon unsaturated double bond. As for the chlorinating agent, normally 2 molar equivalents of a chlorinating agent per mole of tetracarboxylic mono(di)ester are reacted in the presence of a basic compound in an amount twice as large as that of the chlorinating agent. In order to control the molecular weight of the polyimide precursor synthesized, the equivalence may be appropriately adjusted. As for the equivalence of the chlorinating agent, 1.5 to 2.5 molar equivalents are preferable, 1.6 to 2.4 molar equivalents are more preferable, with 1.7 to 2.3 molar equivalents being further preferable. If the equivalence is smaller than 1.5 molar equivalents, the low stress after curing may not be exhibited sufficiently due to a small molecular weight of a polyimide precursor. If the equivalence is larger than 2.5 molar equivalents, a large amount of hydrochloride of the basic compound may remain in the polyimide precursor, and as a result, the electric insulating properties of the polyimide after curing may be lowered. As the basic compound, pyridine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine or the like can be used. It is preferred that it be used in an amount of 1.5 to 2.5 times as that of the chlorinating agent.

In respect of solubility in a solvent and handling properties of a solution, the weight-average molecular weight is preferably 100,000 or less. The weight-average molecular weight can be measured by the gel permeation chromatography and can be obtained by converting by using a standard polystyrene calibration curve. When the polyimide precursor of the present invention is synthesized, the molar ratio of tetracarboxylic dianhydride and diamine is normally 1.0. In order to suppress the molecular weight or the terminal residue, it may be conducted at a molar ratio of 0.7 to 1.3. If the molar ratio is 0.7 or less or 1.3 or more, the molecular weight of the resulting polyimide precursor is decreased, and the low stress after curing may not be sufficiently exhibited. It is preferred that the addition polymerization and the condensation reaction and synthesis of a diester derivative and an acid chloride be conducted in an organic solvent. As the organic solvent used, a polar solvent that perfectly dissolves the polyimide precursor is preferable.

In this heat treatment, a vertical thermal diffusion furnace manufactured by Koyo Lindberg, Ltd. can be used. It is preferred that the heat treatment be conducted at a temperature of 80 to 400° C. for 5 to 300 minutes. By this step, imidization of the polyimide precursor in the resin composition can proceed, whereby a patterned cured film containing a polyimide resin can be obtained. The method for producing a cured film of the present invention comprises a step of applying a resin composition to a substrate, followed by drying, thereby to form a coating film and a step of subjecting the coating film to a heat treatment. The step of forming a coating film and the step of subjecting a coating film to a heat treatment may be conducted in the same way as in the above-mentioned method for producing a patterned cured film. The cured film of the present invention may be a cured film in which no pattern is formed. The cured film or the patterned cured film of the present invention obtained as above can be used as a surface protective layer, an interlayer insulating layer, a re-wiring layer or the like of a semiconductor device. FIG. 1 is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating a semiconductor device according to one embodiment of the invention that includes a redistribution structure. The semiconductor device according to this embodiment has a multilayer wiring structure. An Al wiring layer 2 is formed on an interlayer insulating layer (interlayer insulating film) 1. An insulating layer (insulating film) 3 (e.g., P—SiN layer) is formed on the Al wiring layer 2, and a surface protective layer (surface protective film) 4 is formed on the insulating layer 3. A redistribution layer 6 is formed from a pad 5 of the wiring layer 2. The redistribution layer 6 extends to the upper side of a core 8 that is connected to a conductive ball 7 (external connection terminal) that is formed of solder, gold, or the like. A cover coat layer 9 is formed on the surface protective layer 4. The redistribution layer 6 is connected to the conductive ball 7 through a barrier metal 10. A collar 11 is provided to hold the conductive ball 7. When mounting a package having such a structure, an underfill 12 may be provided to further reduce stress. The cured film or the patterned cured film of the present invention can be used for package applications, i.e. a cover coat material, a redistribution core material, a ball (e.g. solder) collar material, an underfill material, etc., in the above-mentioned embodiment. Since the cured film or the patterned cured film according to the present invention exhibits excellent adhesion to a metal layer, a sealing material, and the like, exhibits excellent copper migration resistance, and has a high stress relaxation effect, the semiconductor device that includes the cured film or the patterned cured film of the present invention has significantly high reliability.

Examples 1 to 17 and Comparative Examples 1 to 13 Components (a) to (c) were dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone at an amount ratio shown in Table 1, whereby a resin composition was prepared. In Table 1, the numeral in parenthesis in each column of component (b) and component (c) indicates the amount added (parts by mass) relative to 100 parts by mass of the component (a). As the solvent, N-methylpyrrolidone was used, and the amount thereof was 1.5 times (150 parts by mass) relative to 100 parts by mass of the component (a). In the Examples, when a photosensitive resin composition was prepared by using the component (c), tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate was compounded in an amount of 20 parts by mass relative to the component (a). For the resin compositions prepared in the Examples and the Comparative Examples, the residual stress of the cured film, the adhesiveness and the storage stability of the composition and the resolution at the time of film formation were measured. The results are shown in Table 1. The methods for evaluation are as follows. (Measurement of Residual Stress) The resulting photosensitive resin composition was applied by spin coating to a 6-inch silicon wafer. The wafer was heated on a hot plate of 100° C. for 3 minutes to evaporate the solvent, whereby a coating film of which the film thickness after curing became about 10 μm was obtained. By using a vertical diffusion furnace manufactured by Koyo Lindberg, Ltd., the coating film was cured by heating in nitrogen atmosphere at 375° C. for 1 hour, whereby a polyimide film (cured film) was obtained. The residual stress of the polyimide film after curing was measured at room temperature by means of a stress measurement apparatus for a thin film (FLX-2320 manufactured by KLA Tencor Corporation). (Evaluation of Adhesiveness) The resulting photosensitive resin composition was applied by spin coating to a 6-inch silicon wafer. The wafer was heated on a hot plate of 100° C. for 3 minutes to evaporate the solvent, whereby a coating film of which the film thickness after curing became about 10 μm was obtained. By using a vertical diffusion furnace manufactured by Koyo Lindberg, Ltd., the coating film was cured by heating in nitrogen atmosphere at 375° C. for 1 hour, whereby a polyimide film (cured film) was obtained. In order to confirm the adhesiveness between the polyimide film and the silicon wafer used as the substrate, after exposing for 100 hours under conditions of 121° C., 2 atm and 100% RH, the polyimide film was subjected to a cross cut test (JIS K5400-8.5 (JIS D0202)). A case where 95 grids of the polyimide film remained on the substrate was evaluated as A, a case where 85 to 94 grids of the polyimide film remained on the substrate was evaluated as B, and a case where 84 or less of grids remained on the substrate was evaluated as C. B or higher was evaluated as having excellent adhesiveness. (Evaluation of Storage Stability) The resulting resin composition was applied by spin coating to a 6-inch silicon wafer. The resultant was heated on a hot plate of 100° C. for 3 minutes to evaporate the solvent, whereby a coating film having a film thickness of about 10 μm was obtained. The film thickness at this time was taken as the initial film thickness. After storing the resin composition at 25° C. for 7 days, under the similar conditions to those for the measurement of the initial film thickness, the resin composition was applied to a 6-inch wafer. The wafer was heated on a hot plate of 100° C. for 3 minutes to evaporate the solvent, whereby a coating film was obtained. A case where the difference between the initial film thickness and the film thickness after the storage for 7 days was within ±0.5 μm was evaluated as A, a case where the difference between the initial film thickness and the film thickness after the storage for 7 days was 0.6 μm or more and 1.0 μm or less was evaluated as B, and a case where the difference between the initial film thickness and the film thickness after the storage for 7 days was larger than 1.0 μm was evaluated as C. B or higher was evaluated as having excellent storage stability. (Evaluation of Photosensitive Characteristics (Resolution)) Evaluation was conducted for a resin composition to which the component (c) had been added. The resin composition was applied to a 6-inch wafer by spin coating. The wafer was heated on a hot plate of 100° C. for 3 minutes to evaporate the solvent, whereby a coating film having a thickness of 10 μm was obtained. The coating film was immersed in a mixed solvent of γ-butyrolactone:butyl acetate=7:3, and the period of time that was twice the time until the film was completely dissolved was taken as the developing time. For the coating film obtained by the similar process, through a photomask, the wafer that had been exposed to i-line (300 mJ/cm2) by using an i-line stepper (FPA-3000 iW) manufactured by Canon Corp. was immersed in a γ-butyrolactone:butyl acetate=7:3 for conducting paddle development. Thereafter, the wafer was rinsed with cyclopentanone. The minimum value of the mask dimension of the line-and-space pattern that had been resolved was evaluated as resolution.
