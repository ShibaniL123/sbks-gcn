b) To a mixture of 4-t-butylbenzenesulfonyl chloride (0.067 g, 0.29 mmol) and 1-(quinolin-5-yl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-amine (0.011 g, 0.04 mmol) in pyridine (0.5 mL) was heated at 80° C. for 2 h with stirring. After cooling to room temperature, dichloromethane was added to the reaction mixture and washed with 1 M aqueous sodium hydrogen sulfate (1 mL). The aqueous layer was further extracted with dichloromethane (2×5 mL), and the combined organic layers were dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was dissolved in methanol (3 mL) and 1 M aqueous sodium hydroxide (1.0 mL, 1.0 mmol), and stirred at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated in vacuo and partitioned between dichloromethane (3 mL) and 1 M aqueous sodium hydrogen sulfate (3 mL). The phases were separated and the aqueous layer was further extracted with dichloromethane (2×5 mL). The combined organic layers were dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude residue was purified by reverse phase HPLC (C18 column, acetonitrile-H2O with 0.1% TFA as eluent) to give the title compound as a white solid (0.006 g, 0.013 mmol, 32%).
