[4-(2-Fluoroethoxy)phenyl]-diphenylphosphine
A reaction vessel was charged with 4-diphenylphosphanyl phenol (1.00 g, 3.59 mmol), toluene-4-sulfonic acid 2-fluoroethyl ester (1.02 g, 4.67 mmol), potassium carbonate (992 mg, 7.18 mmol), and DMF (5 mL). The reaction vessel was heated to 50° C., and reaction was effected for 1 day. After the reaction, water was added to the reaction system, and the product was extracted three times with ethyl acetate into the organic layer. The resulting organic layer was washed with saturated saline and dried with MgSO4. After concentration under reduced pressure, the concentrate was purified by Hi-flash silica column chromatography (developing solvent, ethyl acetate:hexane=4:96→25:75) to yield a product (921 mg (2.84 mmol), 80% yield, white solid).
