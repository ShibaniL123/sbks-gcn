Preparation of a diastereoisomeric mixture of (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-2-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine
4-bromo-2,6-difluorobenzaldehyde (628 mg, 2.84 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of 3-((2R)-2-((3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)amino)propyl)-2-methylaniline (700 mg, 1.42 mmol) and water (0.128 mL, 7.10 mmol) in a mixture of acetic acid (10 mL) and toluene (4 mL). The reaction was heated at 90° C. for 18 hours before being heated at reflux conditions for another 4 hours. The reaction was allowed to cool and was concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was dissolved in DCM and washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3. The aqueous phase was extracted with DCM (20 mL) and the combined organic layers were concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in a mixture of MeOH/DCM (5:1, 18 mL) and then hydroxylamine hydrochloride (148 mg, 2.13 mmol) and sodium acetate (233 mg, 2.84 mmol) were added. The mixture was stirred at 35° C. for 5 minutes and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was dissolved in EtOAc and washed sequentially with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 and saturated aqueous NaCl before being dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 35% EtOAc in hexanes to afford (1S,3R)-1-(4-bromo-2,6-difluorophenyl)-2-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl)-3,5-dimethyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-6-amine (339 mg, 34%) as a pale yellow film.
