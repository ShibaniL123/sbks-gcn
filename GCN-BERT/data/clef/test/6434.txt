To a stirred solution of 1-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-oxopyrrolidine-3-carbonitrile (200 mg) and hydroxylamine hydrochloride (70 mg) in methanol (20 mL) was added sodium hydrogen carbonate (114 mg) at room temperature, and the mixture was heated under reflux for 18 hours. After cooling to the room temperature, methanol was evaporated off under reduced pressure. Water was added to the mixture, and the insolubles were collected by filtration. The solid was dried thoroughly to obtain the title compound (150 mg, yield 65 %).
