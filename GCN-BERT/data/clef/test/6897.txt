The present invention relates to syringes having a piston drive element for engaging and moving a piston within a medication cartridge, by which a dose can be set by rotating a nut along the piston drive element during dose setting, and wherein a set dose can be expelled by driving the nut to its initial position. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION An almost classic pen which adopts the above described dose setting and injecting scheme is described in EP 327 910. By setting a dose on this pen a tubular member forming an injection button is screwed up along a threaded piston rod a distance corresponding to the distance said piston rod must be moved to inject the set dose. The tubular member simply forms a nut which is during the dose setting screwed away form a stop and which is during the injection pressed back to abutment with said stop and the force exerted on the button is directly transmitted to the a piston closing one end of an ampoule in the syringe which ampoule contains the medicament to be injected. When the piston is pressed into the ampoule the medicament is pressed out through a needle mounted through a closure at the other end of the ampoule. By time it has been wanted to store larger amount in the ampoules, typically 3 ml instead of 1.5 ml. As it has not been appropriate to make the syringe longer the ampoule is instead given a larger diameter, i.e. the area of the piston facing the medicament in the ampoule has been doubled and consequently the force which has to be exerted on the piston to provide the same pressure as previously inside the ampoule has been doubled. Further the distance the piston has to be moved to inject one unit of the medicament has been halved. This development is not quite favourable, as especially users having reduced finger strength have their difficulties in pressing the injection button, a problem that is further increased when still thinner needles are used to reduce the pain by injection. Also with quite small movements of the button it is difficult to feel whether the button is moved at all and by injection of one unit from a 3 ml ampoule the piston and consequently the injection button has to be moved only about 0.1 mm. Consequently a wish for a gearing between the injection button and the piston has occurred so that the button has a larger stroke than has the piston. By such a gearing the movement of the injection button is made larger and the force, which has to be exerted on the injection button, is correspondingly reduced. In EP 608 343 a gearing is obtained by the fact that a dose setting element is screwed up along a spindle having a thread with a high pitch. When said dose setting element is pressed back in its axial direction the thread will induce a rotation of said dose setting element, which rotation is via a coupling transmitted to a driver nut with a fine pitch which driver nut will force a threaded not rotatable piston rod forward. A similar gearing is provided in WO 99/38554 wherein the thread with the high pitch is cut in the outer surface of a dose setting member and is engaged by a mating thread on the inner side of the cylindrical housing. However, by this kind of gearing relative large surfaces are sliding over each other so that most of the transformed force is lost due to friction between the sliding surfaces. Therefore a traditional gearing using mutual engaging gear wheels and racks is preferred. From WO 96/26754 is known an injection device wherein two integrated gear wheels engages a rack fixed in the housing and a rack inside a plunger, respectively. When the plunger is moved axially in the housing the rack inside this plunger can drive the first gear wheel to make the other integral gear wheel move along the fixed rack in the housing. Thereby the gear wheel is moved in the direction of the plunger movement but a shorter distance than is this plunger and this axial movement of the integrated gear wheels is via a housing encompassing said gear wheels transmitted to a piston rod which presses the piston of an ampoule further into this ampoule. However, the rack inside the plunger is one of a number axial racks provided inside said plunger. These racks alternates with untoothed recesses, which allow axial movement of the plunger without the first gear wheel being in engagement with a rack in this plunger. This arrangement is provided to allow the plunger to be moved in a direction out of the housing when a dose is set. When the plunger is rotated to set a dose it is moved outward a distance corresponding to one unit during the part of the rotation where the first gear wheel passes the untoothed recess, thereafter the first gear wheel engages one of the racks so the set unit can be injected, or the rotation can be continued to make the first gear wheel pass the next recess during which passing the set dose is increased by one more unit and so on until a dose with the wanted number of units is set. A disadvantage by this construction is that the teeth of the racks and gearwheels alternating have to be brought in,and out of engagement with each other with the inherit danger of clashing. As only a few racks separated by intermediary untoothed recess can be placed along the inner surface of the plunger only few increments can be made during a 360Â° rotation. In US patent No. 6.663.602 is disclosed an injection device, wherein a direct gearing, i.e. a gearing by which more transformations of rotational movement to linear movement and linear movement to rotational movement are avoided, between the injection button and the piston rod. The injection device shown in US patent no. 6.663.602 comprises a housing wherein a piston rod threaded with a first pitch is non rotatable but longitudinally displaceable guided, a nut engaging the thread of the piston rod which nut can be screwed along the threaded piston rod away from a defined position in the housing to set a dose and can be pressed back to said defined position carrying the piston rod with it when the set dose is injected, a dose setting member which can be screwed outward in the housing along a thread with a second pitch to lift an injection button with it up from the proximal end of the housing. This injection device is provided with a gearbox which provides a gearing between the axial movements of the injection button and the nut relative to the housing which gearing has a gearing ratio corresponding to the ratio of said second and first pitch. Although broadly being considered state of the art, the injection device disclosed in US patent No. 6.663.602 presents important mechanical constraints due to the construction principle of the linear gearing system which acts during dosing. According to the injection device of US Patent No. 6.663.602, the length of the nut/piston rod assembly is increased during the dose setting by rotating the nut in a thread on the piston rod. During dosing, the linear displacement of the nut and the injection button are coupled such that there is proportionality between the movement of the nut and the injection button, the proportionality given by the transmission ratio of the gear box. As the nut is rotationally confined relatively to the piston rod during dosing, the translation of the nut corresponds to the translation of the piston rod and thus ultimately to the dose of medication administered. As the gear is an integrated part of the construction and as the gear can only be designed to certain transmission ratios, the gear implies important constraints on the obtainable ratio of movement of the injection button relative to the movement of the piston. Due to the direct proportionality between the movement of the piston rod and the administered dose of medication, the same syringe can not easily be adapted to different medications. Although adaptation is possible by changing the transmission ratio of the linear gear, this solution will in general be very complex and imply a complete redesign of the syringe. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The injection devices disclosed in US patent No. 6.663.602 comprises dose setting and injection mechanisms wherein the nut is held rotationally fixed during dose delivery. However, according to the present invention, the nut may be rotated relative to the housing, also during dose delivery. According to one aspect of the present invention, the injection device comprises: a. a housing for a dose setting and injecting mechanism, the housing having a proximal end and a distal end,b. a rotatable dose setting member,c. an axially displaceable piston rod having a first thread and an additional longitudinally extending track,d. a central opening in the housing for engaging the additional longitudinally extending track of the piston rod, thus guiding the angular movement of the piston rod during axial translation of the piston rod,e. a threaded nut engaging the first thread of the piston rod, the nut being rotatably locked to the dose setting member during dose setting,f. a rotational coupling mechanism having a coupling member which is axially displaceable from a first position to a second position, the rotational coupling mechanism allowing rotational movement of the nut relative to the coupling member during dose setting while preventing rotational movement during injection. The coupling member is rotationally coupled to the housing so as to be urged to rotate as a function of axial displacement of the coupling member relative to the housing during at least a part of the axial displacement from said first to said second position. According to such a configuration, a prolongation or reduction of the stroke of the injection button compared to the stroke of the piston rod may be obtained. Further, as this configuration implies a change in the rate of rotation of the dose setting member for a given dose to be injected, a dose scale reading with a different layout may be obtained. In this way, a scale reading with increased distance between consecutive numbers may be obtained, which provides the possibility of increasing the font size of the labels of the scale reading. Also, this configuration provides the possibility of fine tuning the gearing ratio, if the injection device is so configured. According to a second aspect of the invention, the dose setting member is axially displaceable as a result of rotation of the dose setting member relative to the housing, while the coupling member is coupled to the dose setting member such that axial displacement of the dose setting member substantially corresponds to axial displacement of the coupling member. According to a third aspect of the invention, the coupling member has a thread and is threadedly engaged with a helical thread disposed in the housing, the thread of the housing having a constant pitch. According to this aspect, a particularly simple solution is obtained. According to a fourth aspect of the invention, the coupling member has a thread which engage a longitudinally extending track disposed in the housing wherein the longitudinally extending track has a variable pitch along the extension of the track. According to this aspect, the rotation of the dose setting member is nonlinear with respect to the various specific dose selections. Thus, a dose setting member with a nonlinear scale is obtainable, e.g. a scale can be provided having comparable larger steps for smaller doses to be injected than for larger doses. This implies improved resolution in the low range of injectable doses. Also, an injection button can be provided having a stroke that is nonlinear with respect to the specific amount of drug to be injected, e.g. having a prolonged stroke for smaller doses compared to the solutions provided for in US patent no. 6.663.602. According to a fifth aspect of the invention, the rotational coupling mechanism comprises an incremental feedback mechanism providing incremental clicks during dose setting corresponding to dose volume. This aspect provides an easy adjustment of the rotational movement of the dose setting drum for each click, relatively to the housing part. In combination with the third aspect, an increase or a decrease of distance between the numbers on the dose setting drum or dose setting scale and thus the rotation for each click can be varied by choosing a specific pitch of the thread of the housing which engages the thread of the coupling member. By varying the inclination of the track along the extension of the track, it is possible to vary the rotation per click in a nonlinear way. According to a sixth aspect of the invention, an injection button is operatively connected to a gear box assembly coupling axial movement of the injection button with axial movement of the nut. A gearing between the movements of the injection button and the nut may be obtained by the gearbox comprising at least one gear wheel carried by a connector which projects from the gear box longitudinally displaceable but non rotatable relative to said gearbox and is integral with the nut, a first rack integral with a first element of the gearbox, which element is rotational but not longitudinally displaceable relative to the housing , and second element carrying a second rack projecting from said gearbox longitudinally displaceable but non rotatable relative to said first element and being coupled to the injection button to follow longitudinal movements of said button, the at least one gear wheel engaging the first and the second rack, respectively, and being dimensioned to provide a gearing by which a longitudinal movement of the second rack is transformed to a longitudinal movement of the connector with a gearing ratio for the mentioned longitudinal movements of the second rack and the connector relative to the housing, which gearing ratio substantially corresponds to the ratio of said second to said first pitch. In such a device only the forces necessary to drive the dose setting member are transformed by a thread with a high pitch whereas the forces necessary to move the piston by injection is transmitted to said piston through a conventional gear with constantly engaging gears and racks. In a seventh aspect of the invention, the piston rod is provided with a stop for the movement of the nut along the thread of said piston rod, thereby forming an end-of-content stop. This way a dose setting limiter is provided in the classic way, which involves no additional members to prevent setting of a dose exceeding the amount of liquid left in the ampoule. According to an eighth aspect of the invention, the additional longitudinally extending track on the piston rod is helically disposed on the external surface of the piston rod thereby forming a second thread on the piston rod. By forming this track in a helical fashion, the piston rod is rotated as a result of axial displacement of the piston rod relative to the housing. By rotating the piston rod and the coupling member a similar angle during dosing, it is possible to set smaller or bigger dosevolume per click, and still have an EOC (End-Of-Content) stop between the piston rod and the nut.

DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS The device shown in the appended drawings is shown as an injector pen, which pen has an elongated body with a central axis. However, other forms are within the scope of the invention. In the device shown in FIG. 1 an elongated cylindrical housing 1 has a partitioning wall 2 which divides the housing in a compartment containing a dose setting mechanism and a compartment 3 designed for the accommodation of a not shown ampoule. The partitioning wall 2 is provided with an opening extending there through. Alternatively, the wall may be replaced by an insert which is secured against rotational and axial motion with respect to the main structure of the housing 1, the opening being formed in said insert. A piston rod 4 having a first thread 4a and an additional longitudinally extending track 4b formed in or on the piston rod 4, extends through the opening 2b, which is provided with one or more ribs which mates and engages the additional longitudinal extending track 4b. In accordance with the specific design of the additional longitudinally extending track 4b and the mating opening 2b in partition wall 2, the piston rod 4 is rotationally guided as a function of axial displacement of the piston rod. To obtain a piston rod 4 which is longitudinally displaceable while being rotationally locked relative to the housing, the additional longitudinally extending track 4b is formed as a rectilinear track which extends parallel to the axis of the piston rod 4. Alternatively, to obtain a piston rod 4 which is being rotated as a function of axial displacement of the piston rod 4, the additional longitudinal track 4b is formed as a helical groove or thread which mates and engages with helical ribs or threads formed in opening 2b in the partition wall 2. In accordance with the specific design of the injection device, the first thread 4a and the additional longitudinally extending track 4b may be disposed on opposite ends of the piston rod 4, may be partly overlapping or fully overlapping in the axial direction of the piston rod 4. Furthermore, the thread 4a may be disposed with a larger depth than the additional longitudinally extending track 4b or vice versa. In Fig. 1, the threads 4a and 4b and the threaded opening 2b are schematically represented. Concentrically with the housing 1 the wall 2 carries on its side turning away from the compartment 3 a tubular element 5 which is at a part of it adjacent to the wall 2 provided with an outer thread 6 and which has at its free end a circumferential recess 7. A ring shaped coupling element 8 on a gear box 9 engages the recess 7. By this coupling the gearbox is fixed in the housing 1 in a way that allows the gearbox 9 to rotate in the housing but not to be axially displaced relative to said housing. In the gearbox 9 a gear wheel assembly comprising two integral gear wheels is journaled on a shaft 11, which runs perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the device between two axial connection bars 12. The connection bars 12 project from the gear box towards the partition wall 2 and are connected to a nut 13 which engages the first thread 4a of the piston rod 4. The gear wheel assembly comprises a gear wheel 14 with a large diameter engaging the teeth of a rack 15 which is guided in the gear box to be displaced in the longitudinal direction of the device, and a gear wheel 16 with a small diameter engaging a rack 10 in FIG. 2 extending in the longitudinal direction of the device on the inner wall of the gearbox 9. The gear wheel 16 with the small diameter may be divided into two gear wheels placed on each side of the of the gear wheel 14, and the rack on the inner wall of the gearbox 9 may have a longitudinal recess without any teeth to make room for the gear wheel 14. A tubular dose setting member 17 fitting into the housing 2 is at an end provided with an internal thread mating and engaging the outer thread 6 of the tubular element 5 and has at its other end a part with enlarged diameter forming a dose setting button 18. Due to the engagement with the thread 6 the dose setting member 17 may be screwed in and out of the housing to show a number on a not shown helical scale on its outer surface in a not shown window in the housing 1. A bottom 19 in a deep cup shaped element, which has a tubular part 20 fitting into the dose setting member 17 and encompassing the gearbox 9, forms an injection button. Coupling means between the dose setting member 17 and the cup shaped element ensures that rotation of the dose setting member 17 is transmitted to the cup shaped element. Further the inner wall of the tubular part 20 has longitudinal recesses 22 engaged by protrusions 23 on the gearbox 9 so that rotation of the dose setting member 17 via the cup shaped element is transmitted to the gearbox 9. At the edge of the open end of the cup shaped element a rosette of V-shaped teeth are provided, which teeth engage a corresponding rosette of V-shaped teeth 24 on a coupling member 25 which is pressed against the edge of the cup shaped element by a spring 26 which is compressed between a not toothed side of the coupling member 25 and a round going shoulder 27 on the inner wall of the dose setting member 17 at an inner end of the inner thread of this member. The coupling member 25 is provided with one or more inner protrusions forming a thread 28, which is engaged by a thread or track 37 on the tubular element 5 so that the coupling member 25 will be forced to rotate when it is displaced axially relative to the housing. The track 37 may be designed as a helical thread with a constant pitch along the extension of the track. Alternatively, the layout of the pitch may be formed with a variable pitch along the extension of the track, e.g. by forming a track with inclined as well non-inclined rectilinear steps, or curved parts. The track 37 is so shaped that the dose setting member 17 rotates relative to the coupling member 25, when a user dials a dose by rotating the dose setting button 18. In this way a click coupling is established which makes a click noise when the V-shaped teeth at the edge of the cup shaped element by rotation of this element rides over the V-shaped teeth of the coupling member 25, i.e. an incremental feedback mechanism is provided. A head 29 on the projecting end of the rack 15 is with a play fixed at the bottom of the cup shaped element between the bottom 19 forming the injection button and an inner wall 30 near this bottom. The rack is fixed in a position with its head pressed against the wall 30 by a spring 31 between the bottom 19 and the head 29. To set a dose the dose setting button 18 is rotated to advance the dose-setting member 17 in the proximal direction in accordance with the thread 6. Due to the coupling 21 the cup shaped element will follow the rotation of the dose-setting member 17 and will be lifted concurrently with this member up from the end of the housing 1. During dose setting, the respective amount of axial displacement of the dose setting member 17 and the injection button 19 depends on the pitch of the thread 6, the pitch of the first thread on the piston rod 4and the gear ratio. Also, if the piston rod 4 is allowed to move during dose setting, the axial and rotational movement of the piston rod 4 influences the amount that the injection button will be displaced. By the rotation of the cup shaped element the V-shaped teeth 24 at the edge of its open end will ride over the V-shaped teeth of the coupling member 25 to make a click sound for each unit the dose is changed. A too high set dose can be reduced by rotating the dose setting button 18 in the opposite direction of the direction for increasing the dose. When the dose setting member is screwed along the thread 6 on the tubular element 5, the coupling member 25 will follow the dose setting member in its axial movement as the spring 26 is supported on the shoulder 27. The spring will keep the V-shaped teeth of the coupling member 25 and the cup shaped element in engagement and maintain in engagement the coupling 21, which may comprise Î-shaped protrusions 32 on the cup shaped element engaging Î-shaped recesses in an inner ring 33 in the dose setting button 18. Due to the axial displacement of the dose setting member 17 during dose setting, the coupling member 25 is axially displaced as well. According to the specific design of the threads or tracks 28 and 37, the coupling member 25 is forced to rotate as the coupling member 25 is axially displaced. In some embodiments, the thread 37 is formed as a helical thread which has a constant pitch along the length of the total axial distance that the coupling member is allowed to move. Depending on the direction of rotation of track 37, the dose setting button 18 has to be rotated a larger or smaller angle for each click to occur compared to a situation where the coupling member is kept rotationally fixed. A corresponding amendment of the layout of the scale reading may be provided, e.g. by forming the dose scale with larger or smaller spaces between neighboring dose values. The rotation of the dose setting button 18 and the cup shaped element is further transmitted to the gearbox 9 through the protrusions 23 on this gearbox engaging the longitudinal recesses 22 in the inner wall of the tubular part 20 of said cup shaped element. The rotation of the gearbox 9 is through the connection bars 12 transmitted to the nut 13, which in this way is advanced along the first thread 4a of the piston rod 4 and lifted away from its abutment with the wall 2 when a dose it set. As the dose is set by moving the nut 13 on the piston rod which operates the piston in the not shown ampoule in the compartment 3, a dose setting limiter, which ensures that the size of the set dose does not exceed the amount of medicament left in the ampoule, can easily be established by providing the piston rod 4 with a stop 35 which limits the movement of the nut 13 up along the piston rod 4. Due to the confinement of the head 29 in the space between the bottom 19 and the wall 30 of the cup shaped element, the rack 15 is drawn with the injection button outward. Depending on the specific gear ratio of the gear assembly, the outward movement of the rack 15 corresponds to an outward movement of nut 13. As the nut 13 is rotated during dose setting, the length of the piston rod/nut assembly is prolonged, depending on the mutual pitch of the piston rod/nut threads and depending on the actual design of the additional longitudinally extending track 4b. By varying the pitch of the different threads or the gear ratio, the piston rod is either moved distally, proximally or held stationary during dose setting. Ideally, if no axial movement of the piston rod 4 is wanted during dose setting the pitch of the thread 6 and the thread formed in the piston rod 4a as well as the pitch of the outer recess (6) should be matched exactly to the gearing ratio of the gear box depicted in figure 2. However, tolerances in the machining of the components comprising the pen may lead to a slight unintended mismatch of the pitches relatively to the transmission ratio of the gearbox 9. Especially the situation where the piston rod 4 advances slightly during dose setting is highly undesirable as the injection device during dose setting will expel a small amount of medication. This situation is avoided by mismatching one or more of the above mentioned pitches to the transmission ratio of the gearbox such that the piston rod 4 is slightly withdrawn during dose setting. The mismatch of pitches is most simply implemented by modification of the pitch of the recess 4a made in the piston rod 4 and the corresponding thread in the nut 13. In addition, if the additional longitudinally extending track 4b on piston rod forms a helical thread, i.e. allowing the piston rod 4 to rotate with respect to the housing (1), this threaded connection has to be taken into account when designing the mechanism. Alternatively, the injection device is designed such that the recess in the piston rod is initially designed to be axially aligned with the piston rod. On assembled production prototypes the advance of the piston rod during dose setting is measured. Hereafter the axial aligned recess is redesigned to a helical recess where the superimposed rotation of the piston rod during dose setting compensates for the tolerances in the machining. According to one embodiment of the invention the pitches of the threaded parts and the linear gearing are matched such that the piston rod retracts between 0% and 2% of the full linear translation relatively to the cartridge during dose setting. A corresponding solution can be provided in the injection device shown in US patent No. 6.663.602 which contains an injection device having a coupling member 25, which is kept rotationally locked with respect to the housing. For that particular injection device, a slight mismatch of either the thread 6 or the thread of piston rod 4 to the transmission ratio of the gearbox can be provided such that the piston rod 4 is slightly withdrawn during dose setting. In the device according to the instant invention, to inject a set dose the injection button is pressed by pressing on the bottom 19. In the initial phase of the pressing, the spring 31 is compressed where after the pressing force is directly transmitted to the head 29 of the rack 15 and this way to the rack 15 itself. Through the gear box 9 the force is transformed and is transmitted through the connection bars 12 to the nut 13 which will press the piston rod 4 into the compartment 3 until the dose-setting member 17 abuts the wall 2. During the initial phase of the movement of the injection button the Î-shaped protrusions 32 on the cup shaped element will be drawn out of their engagement with the Î-shaped recesses in the ring 33. The dose-setting member 17 can now rotate relative to the injection button and will do so when the Î-shaped protrusions 32 press against a shoulder 34 at the bottom of the dose setting button 18. Only a force sufficient to make the dose setting member rotate to screw itself downward along the thread 6 is necessary as the force necessary to make the injection is transmitted to the piston rod 4 through the gearbox 9. A helical reset spring 36 concentric with the dose setting member can be mounted at the lower end of this member and can have one end anchored in the dose setting member 17 and the other end anchored in the wall 2. During setting of a dose this spring may be tighter coiled so that on the dose setting member it exerts a torque approximately corresponding to the torque necessary to overcome the friction in the movement of the dose setting member along the thread 6 so that the force which the user have to exert on the injection button is only the force necessary to drive the piston rod into an ampoule to inject the set dose. It shall be noticed that use of only one size gear wheel which engages as well the rack 15, which is movable relative to the gear box 9, as the rack 10, which is unmovable relative to the gear box, provides a gearing ratio of 2:1 for the longitudinal movement relative to the syringe housing 1 for the movable rack 15 and the connector 12, which carries the shaft 11 of the gear wheel. FIGS. 3 and 4 shows an embodiment wherein only one size gear wheel is used and wherein elements corresponding to elements in FIGS. 1 and 2 are given the same references as these elements with a prefixed "1". For manufacturing reasons minor changes are made. So the partitioning wall 102 and the tubular element 105 are made as two parts which are by the assembling of the device connected to each other to make the assembled parts act as one integral part. The same way the dose setting member 117 and the dose setting button 118 are made as two parts, which are fixed firmly together. A circumferential recess 107 is provided as an outer recess at the free end of the tubular part 105 and a ring shaped coupling element is provided as an inner bead 108 on the gearbox element 109 which bead engages the recess 107 to provide a rotatable but not axially displaceable connection between the tubular part 105 and the gearbox. A tubular element 120 having ridges 122 which engages recesses 123 on the gearbox is at its upper end closed by a button 119 from which a force provided by pressing this button is transmitted to the tubular element 120. The gearbox is formed by two shells, which together form a cylinder fitting into the tubular element where the shells are guided by the engagement between the ridges 122 and the recesses 123. Racks 110 and 115 are provided along edges of the shells facing each other. One shell forming the gearbox part 109 is provided with the inner bead 108, which engages the circumferential recess 107 at the end of the central tubular part 105 and carries the rack 110. The other shell is axially displaceable in the tubular element 120 and forms the rack 115. At its outer end projecting from the gearbox the shell carrying the rack 115 is provided with a flange 140 which is positioned in a cut out 141 in the end of the tubular element 120 carrying the button 119 so that this button and the tubular element 120 can be moved so far inward in the device that the engagement of the teeth 132 and 133 can be released before the button 119 abuts the flange 140. A tubular connection element 112 connects the threaded piston rod 104 with the gearbox. At its end engaging the piston rod 104 the connection element has a nut 113 with an internal thread mating the external thread 104a of the piston rod 104. At its end engaging the gear box the connection element is provided with two pins 111 projecting perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the connection element 112 at each side of this element. Each pin 111 carries a gear wheel 114 which is placed between and engages the two racks 110 and 115. This way the connection element 112 will be rotated with the gear box but can be displaced axially relative to said gear box when the racks 110 and 115 are moved relative to each other. In practice it will be the rack 115, which is moved relative to the gearbox element 109 and the housing 1 and will by the shown construction result in a movement of the connection element 112 relative to housing a distance which is half the distance which the rack 115 is moved. A coupling member 125 which is at its periphery provided with a rosette of teeth 124 and has a central bore fitting over the central tube in the housing 101 so that this coupling member 125 can be axially displaced along said central tube 105. One or more internal protrusions 128 on the central bore of the coupling member 125 is shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The protrusions engage mating helical recessed tracks or threads 137 (not shown in Figs. 3 and 4) in the central tube to make the coupling member 125 confined with respect to rotational movements, that is, the coupling member 125 being angularly moved in accordance with the axial displacement of the coupling member 125 along the tracks or threads 137. Due to this rotational confinement or rotational guiding in the housing, a rosette of teeth at the edge of the tubular element 120 can click over the teeth 124 of the coupling member when said tubular element is rotated together with the dose setting member 117. A spring 126 working between the coupling member 125 and an internal shoulder 127 provided in the dose setting member 117 makes the coupling member follow the tubular element 120 when this element with the dose setting member is moved longitudinally in the housing. To make the dose setting member easy rotatable, especially when said dose setting member is pressed inward in the housing, a roller bearing having an outer ring 142 supported by the shoulder 127 and an inner ring 143 supporting a pressure bushing 144 which supports the spring 126. By the provision of this smooth running support only very small axial forces are needed to rotate the dose setting member 117 back to its zero position when a set dose is injected. This solution replaces the provision of a reset spring as the spring 36 in FIG. 1. The bearing is shown as a radial bearing but can be replaced by an axial bearing. Whereas the track 137 is not shown in Figs. 3 and 4, this track can be viewed in Fig. 5 which depicts an exploded view of the embodiment shown in Fig. 3 and 4. The central tubular part 105 is further shown in a greater scale in Fig 6a while Fig. 6b the corresponding part of prior art injection shown in US patent No. 6.663.602. Table 1 is a list showing different configurations of the above-described injection device. In table 1, configuration no. 1 corresponds to the device which is disclosed in US patent No. 6.663.602, i.e. a device having a piston rod that is non-rotational but axially displaceable and having a track 37, 137 which is a rectilinear track which extends parallel to the axis of the injection device. Configurations no. 2-6 correspond to embodiments having the same pitch of the threads 6, 106 on the dose setting member and the first thread 4a, 104a on the piston rod as in configuration no. 1. In configuration no. 2-6, the track 37, 137 is formed as a helical track having a constant pitch along the extension of the track, each of the configurations corresponding to specific pitches of the track. Configurations 1-4 have a piston rod that is non-rotational but axially displaceable. Configurations no. 5 and 6 has a helical track 4b, 104b which mates and engages the threaded opening 2b in the housing. Table 1.

Corresponding rotational movement of the dose setting drum relative to the coupling member 25, 125 is listed in column 4 and the resulting axial displacement of the piston rod is listed in column 5. Comparing examples 1-3 and 5 in table 2, it becomes clear that variation of the pitch of track 37, 137 changes the amount of the rotation that the dose setting member has to be dialed in order to expel a desired dose. Thereby an easy adjustment method is provided where the amount that the dose setting member has to be rotated for advancing the dose setting button one click, can be altered. Also, this provides the possibility of changing the angular distance between consecutive numbers on the dose scale. Hence, to obtain a dose scale layout with enlarged font size or, alternatively, a decreased font size, the pitch of the track 37, 137 is chosen in accordance herewith. Comparing example 3 and 6, it is readily apparent that introducing a threaded coupling between the piston rod and the housing, i.e. making the piston rod rotatable with respect to the housing, provides for the possibility of obtaining an injection device with altered dosing amounts, e.g. a half-increment injection device. When introducing a coupling member 25, 125 that rotates relative to the housing, the end-of-content mechanism as described above may not work in an optimal way. However, by choosing the same pitch for the additional longitudinally extending track 4b, 104b on the piston rod as for the pitch of the track 37, 137 it is ensured that the end-of-content limitation that the user may experience when setting a dose for injection, corresponds to the exact amount that will be expelled during dosing. In this way, a cartridge may be fully emptied when injecting the dose which corresponds to the end-of-content setting, i.e. the situation where the piston rod 4, 104 is fully retracted relative to the nut 13, 113, In further embodiments, the track 37, 137 may be designed to have a varying pitch along the track, i.e. having linear parts with inclined or non-inclined stretches as well as curved stretches. Also, the rotational direction of the track may be changed from one part of the track to another part of the track. One specific embodiment may be designed for larger relative dose button movements for small dose settings than for dose settings corresponding to large doses. Thereby it is ensured that the resolution for small dose settings is held at a comparative high level. Although the above described embodiments show different specific gearbox assemblies, it is to be noted that, within the scope of the present invention, various other types of gearboxes can be used. Also, the functionality of the gearbox can be omitted while the injection device still being within the scope of the present invention. In addition, alternative embodiments having a dose setting member which is kept axially fixed during dose setting/dosing will be applicable with the present invention and within the scope of the appended claims. One non-limiting embodiment comprises an additional slave member which is rotationally coupled to the dose setting member, and which can be used for inducing axial movement on the coupling member during dose setting. Further, a frictional coupling may be provided instead of the above-described incremental feedback mechanism, whereby doses may be set among a continuous selection of dose amounts.
