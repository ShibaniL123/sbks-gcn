FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration that are resistant to abuse by intake of alcohol. The pharmaceutical compositions are in the form of matrix compositions or coated matrix compositions, wherein the matrix compositions comprise one or more low molecular weight polyglycols combined with one or more effervescent agents. The pharmaceutical compositions have a relatively high hardness due to the ingredients and the manufacturing method. The pharmaceutical compositions may also contain a disintegrant. The pharmaceutical compositions are typically prepared by injection moulding or heat extrusion but can also be in form of compressed tablets. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In recent years, a tendency has emerged among people, especially young people, to increase the effect of alcohol and/or specific drug substances by intake of for example pain relievers or fever reducers in combination with alcohol. Many pharmaceutical compositions for oral use release the drug substance with a faster release rate in the presence of alcohol and, accordingly, the drug substance is available for absorption at a faster rate than intended by the manufacturer. Such a faster release rate may lead to unwanted and potentially dangerous effects. This may lead to unwanted effects similar to the effect denoted “dose dumping”. Unintended, rapid drug release in a short period of time of the entire amount or a significant fraction of the drug substance retained in a controlled release dosage form is often referred to as “dose dumping”. It has been reported that some modified-release oral dosage forms contain drug substances and excipients that exhibit higher solubility in ethanolic solutions compared to aqueous media. Such products can be expected to exhibit a more rapid drug dissolution and release rate in the presence of ethanol. Therefore, in theory, concomitant consumption of alcoholic beverages along with these products might be expected to have the potential to induce dose dumping (FDA's ACPS Meeting 2005). However, the problem is not only of relevance for controlled release dosage form, but also for conventional oral dosage forms and for immediate release dosage forms. Moreover, in the 1990s, Food and Drug Administrations in USA (FDA) announced that for example over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers and fever reducers must carry a warning label advising consumers who consume three or more alcoholic drinks every day to consult a physician before using these drugs. FDA issued this final rule after considering public comments and data on the effect of combining chronic alcohol ingestion and the use of various OTC analgesics. The action also followed the recommendations of the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee and the Arthritis Drugs Advisory Committee which concluded that chronic alcohol users should be warned that they may be at an increased risk of liver damage or stomach bleeding from use of these drugs. Relevant drug substances are for example aspirin, other salicylates, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, or ketoprofen. A number of controlled release pharmaceutical compositions have been developed that are said to be resistant towards abuse by intake of alcohol. However, there is still a need for developing pharmaceutical compositions with immediate release of a drug substance (analgesics, antipyretics etc.) that also are resistant to abuse by intake of alcohol.

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides immediate release compositions, wherein the release of the drug substance is decreased when the immediate release composition is tested in the in vitro dissolution test described herein using a dissolution medium containing 40% v/v ethanol compared with the release of the drug substance, when the immediate release composition is tested in the in vitro dissolution test described herein using the same dissolution medium, but without any content of ethanol. Such immediate release compositions are obtained by using a polyglycol having a molecular weight of from 900 to 17,000 Daltons in a concentration of at least 5% w/w, one or more effervescent agents and optionally one or more disintegrants. The polyglycol and effervescent agent are both essential ingredients. The present inventors have found that a suitable method for preparing such immediate release compositions are by means of injection moulding or heat extrusion but also by compression by using tabletting machines. Accordingly, the lower limit for suitable polyglycols is set by the melting point of the polyglycols, as the final immediate release composition should be in solid form, wherein the drug substance is dispersed in the matrix. It should be mentioned that the present applicant in several patents and patent applications (see for example WO 89/09066, WO 91/004015, WO 95/22962, WO 99/51208, WO 03/024429, WO 03/024426, WO 03/024430, WO 2004/041252, WO 2004/084869, WO 2004/084868, WO 2006/128471, WO 2008/086804, WO 2008/148798) has described the use of polyglycols with a molecular weight of from 20,000 and above for the preparation of a controlled release pharmaceutical composition. In contrast thereto, the present invention provides ethanol-resistant immediate release compositions comprising a polyglycol having a molecular weight of from 900 to 17,000 Daltons in a concentration of 5% w/w or more, a drug substance, one or more effervescent agents and optionally one or more disintegrants for the preparation of an immediate release composition that is resistant to abuse by intake of alcohol. In a specific embodiment, the present invention thus provides for the use of a polyglycol having a molecular weight of from 900 to 17,000 Daltons, a drug substance, one or more effervescent agents and optionally one or more disintegrants for the preparation of an immediate release composition that is resistant to abuse by intake of alcohol. In another embodiment, said immediate release composition is resistant to abuse by intake of alcohol when the composition is ingested with alcohol. In a further embodiment, said immediate release composition is formulated to exhibit a hardness that renders the composition resistant to crushing. In an even further embodiment, the immediate release composition according to the present invention are resistant to abuse by intake of alcohol when said alcohol is ingested either: a. together with the immediate release composition, or b. within a period of up to 60 minutes before and up to 60 minutes after ingesting the immediate release composition. In another embodiment, the invention provides a immediate release composition comprising a polyethylene glycol having a molecular weight of from 900 to 17,000 Daltons, one or more effervescent agents, optionally one or more disintegrants and one or more drug substances selected from anaesthetics, analgesics, opioids, antipyretics, antimigraine agents, antiepileptics, anti-parkinson agents, dopaminergic agents, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, sedatives, antidepressants, psychostimulating agents used for ADHD, nootropics and agents used in addictive disorders. A immediate release composition according to the invention may also be used i) to prevent abuse of said drug substance, when the immediate release composition is ingested with alcohol, ii) to prevent dose dumping of said drug substance, when the immediate release composition is ingested with alcohol, and/or iii) to treat a patient suffering from a disease, disorder or condition to which the drug substance is therapeutically effective, wherein the patient ingests 3 or more alcoholic beverages daily. In particular embodiments, the patient to be treated ingests an alcoholic beverage either: a. together with the immediate release composition, orb. within a period of up to 60 minutes before and up to 60 minutes after ingesting the immediate release composition. The present invention also provides for the use of a immediate release composition comprising a drug substance, a polyglycol having a molecular weight of from 900 to 17,000 Daltons, one or more effervescent agents and optionally one or more disintegrants to prevent abuse of said drug substance when the immediate release composition is ingested with alcohol. In a further embodiment, the invention provides for the use of an immediate release composition comprising a polyglycol having a molecular weight of from 900 to 17,000 Daltons, a drug substance, one or more effervescent agents and optionally one or more disintegrants to prevent dose dumping of said drug substance when the immediate release composition is ingested with alcohol. Methods for preparing immediate release compositions resistant to abuse by intake of alcohol or by crushing are also provided herein. The present invention also relates to a method for the preparation of an immediate release composition as defined above, the method comprising: i) mixing a drug substance and a polyglycol having a molecular weight of from 900 to 17,000 Daltons with one or more effervescent agents and optionally one or more disintegrants,ii) processing an injection moulding machine, an extruder or a tablet compression machine with the mixture obtained in step i) According to the present invention, the drug substance is released from the immediate release composition in the stomach of a patient with a release profile that is dependent on the concentration of ethanol, such that an increased ethanol concentration results in a decreased rate of drug release. Polymers Suitable polymers for use according to the invention typically comprise a polyglycol, typically in the form of a homopolymer. In a specific embodiment the polymer is substantially water-soluble, thermoplastic, crystalline, semi-crystalline or amorphous or a mixture of substantially water-soluble, crystalline, semi-crystalline or amorphous polymers. Suitable polymers for use in an immediate release composition according to the invention are polyethylene glycols, including derivatives such as mono- and dimethoxypolyethylene glycols (mPEGs) and polyethylene oxides. The immediate release compositions described herein may be prepared as matrix compositions formed using the polyglycol polymers described herein. Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are linear polydisperse polymers composed of repeating units of ethylene glycol. Their chemical formula is HOCH2[CH2OCH2]mCH2OH where m represents the average number of repeating units. Alternatively, the general formula H[OCH2CH2]nOH may be used to represent polyethylene glycol, where n is a number m in the previous formula+1. See the structural presentations of polyethylene glycol below. n is the average number of oxyethylene groups. n equals m+1. Polyethylene oxides (PEOs) are linear polydisperse nonionic polymers composed of repeating units of ethylene oxide. Their chemical formula is HO[CH2CH2O]nH where n represents the average number of oxyethylene groups. See the structural presentation of polyethylene oxide below. n is the average number of oxyethylene groups. Depending on the preparation method, high molecular weight PEO may have one terminal methyl group. Polyethylene glycols are mixtures of addition of ethylene glycol. In general PEG refers to polymers chains with molecular weights below 20,000, while PEO refers to higher molecular weights polymers. However, because of the similarities between PEO and PEG, the terms are often used interchangeably for the same compound. Polyethylene glycols and/or polyethylene oxides, which are suitable for use in the matrix compositions of the present invention, are those having molecular weights of from 900 Daltons, to 17,000 Daltons. Commercially available PEG/PEO's relevant for the present invention have the following average molecular weights: 1000, 1100, 1900, 2000, 2800, 2900, 3350, 4400, 5800, 6000, 8000, 8400, 10,000, 12,000, 14,600 or 17,000 Daltons. In specific embodiments of the invention, an immediate release composition according to the present invention thus comprises a polyglycol having a molecular weight of 1000, 1100, 1900, 2000, 2800, 2900, 3350, 4400, 5800, 6000, 8000, 8400, 10,000, 12,000, 14,600 or 17,000 Daltons. In one or more embodiments of the invention, the immediate release composition comprises a polyglycol selected from PEG 3350 S, PEG 6000, PEG 10 000, PEG 14 000 and PEG 17 000. As described in patent applications/patent in the name of the Applicant (see above), PEG's/PEO's have been used in the preparation of coated matrix compositions with controlled release. However, in order to ensure controlled release, it is important to choose PEG's/PEO's with a relatively high molecular weight, i.e. 20,000 or more. Compositions of the present invention are in contrast hereto immediate release compositions, which the Applicant has found to function best using PEG's/PEO's having a molecular weight of from 900 to 17,000 Daltons. Mixtures of PEO with different average molecular weights can be used in order to obtain a PEO with a desirable average molecular weight. The same applies to PEG. The polymer has a melting point higher than the body temperature of the human in which the immediate release composition is to be used. Thus, the polymer(s) employed in the matrix composition will suitably have a melting point of between 30° C.-120° C. such as, for example from 35° C. to 100° C. or from 40° C. to 80° C. In addition to a polymer of a polyglycol type as described above other polymers may be suitable for use in an immediate release composition provided that the solubility and/or release rate of the drug substance from the composition in aqueous media is higher than the solubility and/or release rate of the composition in an aqueous media containing 40% v/v ethanol as is tested in the in vitro dissolution test described herein using a aqueous media containing 40% v/v ethanol. More specifically, the solubility or release is at least 1.5 times higher, at least 2 times higher in aqueous media than in alcohol, notably 5 times, 10 times, 25 times, 50 times or 100 times higher. Thus, in other embodiments of the invention, the polymer or an additional polymer to the polyglycol may be selected from one or more of the following polymers: modified or unmodified water soluble natural polymers such as glucomannan, galactan, glucan, polygalacturonic acid, polyxylane, polygalactomannans, rhanogalacturonan, polyxyloglycan, arabinogalactan, and starch, cellulose, chitosan, alginate, fibrin, collagen, gelatin, hyaluronic acid, amylopectin, pectin including low methylated or methoxylated pectins, dextran and fatty acids and alcohols; synthetic polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), PVA, PVB, Eudragit L methyl ester, Eudragit L, Eudragit RL, Eudragit E, Eudragit S, PHPV, PHA, PCL, PLGA and PLA; and hydrogels made from the polymers or combined polymers mentioned above and or from polymers originated from: HEMA, HEEMA, MEMA, MEEMA, EDGMA, NVP, VAc, AA, acrylamide, MAA, HPMA, PEGA, PEGMA, PEGDMA, PEGDA, and PEGDMA. One or more polymers are typically present in an immediate release composition of the invention in a concentration amount of from 5% w/w to 99.9% w/w such as from 10% w/w to 95% w/w such as from 15% w/w to 90% w/w, such as from 20% w/w to 85% w/w, such as from 30% w/w to 85% w/w calculated as w/w % of the composition. Disintegrants and Effervescent Agents As mentioned above, an immediate release composition according to the invention comprises one or more effervescent agents and may comprise one or more disintegrants. In some situations (as mentioned above) it is important that the disintegrant and/or the effervescent agent are swellable or soluble in aqueous media and inswellable or insoluble in an aqueous dissolution medium containing 40% v/v of ethanol. Normally, with respect to disintegrants, disintegrants are high molecular weight materials, where it is more relevant to discuss the ability to swell than the solubility. Accordingly, for such substances it is important that they exert their disintegration properties in water or aqueous solutions, whereas the disintegration properties are eliminated or markedly reduced in aqueous solutions containing 40% v/v of ethanol. When solubility is important, the solubility in aqueous solutions containing 40% v/v of ethanol is at the most sparingly soluble, cf. the definitions below. The dissolution medium or aqueous medium is either a phosphate buffer medium pH 6.8 or hydrochloride solution pH 1.2. Solubility definitions; Parts of solvent needed to dissolve 1 part of solute at ambient temperature—Very soluble <1; Freely soluble 1-10, Soluble 10-30; Sparingly soluble 30-100; Slightly soluble 100-1000; Very slightly soluble 1000-10,000, Insoluble >10,000. The applicant has surprisingly found that a significant slower release rate in alcoholic media is noticed when a formulation according to the present invention based on PEG contains one or more effervescent agents alone or contains a particular combination of effervescent and disintegrant. This effect was not observed using a disintegrant alone. This behavior may have an in vivo effect, so that potential abusers would not achieve an enhancing effect when taking the tablet in combination with alcohol. An immediate release composition having a time delay of at least 20 minutes for example at least 30 minutes, such as at least 40 minutes, for example such as at least 50 minutes and such as at least 60 minutes in alcohol (40% v/v of alcohol) has been developed. Alcohol generally enhances penetration of the epithelia by drug substances, but the time delay provided by immediate release compositions described herein may offset the increase in permeability normally associated by the presence of alcohol such that the desired in vivo effect of the immediate release composition is substantially maintained (for example, absorption rate of the drug from the immediate release composition is substantially maintained), even in the presence of alcohol. The effervescent agent preferably is at least one component of an effervescent couple that includes an acid and a base. The effervescent couple is activated when contacted with water. The water liberates the acid and base and enables the acid and base to react with each other to produce carbon dioxide gas. Examples of useful acids include water soluble organic acids. Further specific examples include citric acid, ascorbic acid, glutaric acid, malic acid, malonic acid, adipic acid, clavulanic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, sodium acid pyrophosphate, sorbic acid, sodium citrate dehydrate, lactic acid, hexamic acid, benzoic acid, etianic acids, disphosphonoic acids and acidic salts and acid anhydrides thereof, and mixtures thereof. Examples of useful acid anhydrides include citraconic anhydride, glucono-D-lactone, sulphuric acid, hyaluronic acid and succinic anhydride. Examples of useful acid salts include potassium bitartrate, acid citrate salts, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium dihydrogen phosphate, and combinations thereof. The acid is present in the immediate release composition in an amount of from 1% by weight to 60% by weight or from 2% by weight to 30% by weight. The base preferably is capable of generating carbon dioxide. Examples of useful bases include water soluble carbonates and bicarbonates. Further specific examples of suitable bases include sodium bicarbonate such as “Effer-Soda”, sodium carbonate, sodium sesqui-carbonate, potassium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, ammonium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, sodium glycine carbonate, L-lysine carbonate, arginine carbonate, zinc carbonate, and mixtures thereof. The base is present in the immediate release composition in an amount of from 1% by weight to 60% by weight or from 2% by weight to 50% by weight. In one or more embodiments the effervescent couple is selected from citric acid+NaHCO3, Tartaric acid+NaHCO3, Succinic acid+NaHCO3, Malonic acid+NaHCO3, Benzoic acid+NaHCO3, Oxalic acid+NaHCO3, Malic acid+NaHCO3 and Glutaric acid+NaHCO3 Examples of suitable disintegrants include Sodium starch glycolate, Povidone, Sodium alginate, Alginic acid, Calcium alginate, Carboxymethylcellulose calcium, Carboxy-methylcellulose sodium, Powdered cellulose, Chitosan, Croscarmellose sodium (Croscarmellose Na), Crospovidone, Cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, Hydroxypropyl starch, Hydroxypropyl cellulose low-substituted, Magnesium aluminium silicate, Methyl-cellulose, Microcrystalline cellulose, pregelatinized starch, Docusae sodium, Guar gum, Polacrilin potassium. The disintegrant is present in the immediate release composition in an amount of from 1% by weight to 60% by weight, from 5% by weight to 50% by weight. In one or more embodiments, the disintegrant is Croscarmellose sodium. Normally, the concentration of the one or more disintegrants, and/or effervescent agent is from 1% w/w to 80% w/w such as, for example, from 5% w/w to 70% w/w, from 10% w/w to 60% w/w. One or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients or additives may also be present (see the section “Pharmaceutically acceptable excipients”). Pharmaceutically Acceptable Excipients The immediate release composition may also contain other excipients as well, for example in order to improve the technical properties of the immediate release composition so that it may be easier to produce or in order to improve the properties of the immediate release composition such as release rate of the drug substance, stability of the drug substance or of the composition itself etc. A suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipient for use in an immediate release composition of the invention may be selected from fillers, diluents, disintegrants, glidants, pH-adjusting agents, viscosity adjusting agents, solubility increasing or decreasing agents, osmotically active agents and solvents. Normally excipients like glidants/lubricants are included in a concentration of from 0 to 5% w/w, binders in a concentration of from 0 to 25% w/w, solubility increasing agents in a concentration of from 0 to15% w/w, stabilizers in a concentration of 0 to15% w/w and modifiers in a concentration of 0 to 15% w/w.

Other suitable examples also include Anabolic steroids, cannabis, cocaine and diazepam. The above mentioned drug substances may also be in the form of pharmaceutically acceptable salts, uncharged or charged molecules, molecular complexes, solvates or anhydrates thereof, and, if relevant, isomers, enantiomers, racemic mixtures, and mixtures thereof. Furthermore, the drug substance may be in any of its crystalline, polymorphous, semi-crystalline, and amorphous or polyamorphous forms. The drug substance may by modified to change physical-chemical properties of the drug substance, which may be by increasing or decreasing lipophilicity to modify the release characteristics of the drug substance. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” of a drug substance includes alkali metal salts such as, for example, sodium or potassium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as, for example, calcium and magnesium salts, and salts with organic or inorganic acid like for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methane sulphonic acid, toluene sulphonic acid. The term “solvates” includes hydrates or solvates wherein other solvates than water are involved such as, for example, organic solvents like chloroform and the like. The concentration of the drug substance in an immediate release composition for use according to the invention depends on several factors, including, for example the specific drug substance, the disease to be treated, the condition of the patient, the age and gender of the patient etc. The above-mentioned drug substances are well-known drug substances and a person skilled in the art will be able to find information as to the dosage of each drug substance and, accordingly, will know how to determine the amount of each drug substance in an immediate release composition. The drug substance may be a new chemical entity for which the amount of dosing information is limited. In such cases the dosage regimen has to be evaluated based on available preclinical and clinical data. The drug substance is typically present in an immediate release composition of the invention in a concentration amount of from 0.01% w/w-99% w/w such as, for example, from 0.01% w/w to 90% w/w, from 0.01% w/w to 80% w/w, from 0.01% w/w to 70% w/w, from 0.01% w/w to 50% w/w or from 0.01% w/w to 40% w/w. In an embodiment of the invention, the drug substance is typically a pharmaceutically active powder. The powder typically has a particle size of from 0.1 μm to 500 μm, typically from 0.5 μm to 300 μm, more typically from 1 μm to 200 μm, especially from 5 μm to 100 μm. In an embodiment of the invention, the drug substance is a pharmaceutically active crystal. The crystal typically has a particle size of from about 0.1 μm to 1000 μm such as, for example, 0.1 μm to 750 μm, 0.1 μm to 500 μm, typically from 0.5 μm to 500 μm, more typically from 1 μm to 500 μm, especially from 5 μm to 500 μm. In another embodiment of the invention, an immediate release composition comprises a drug substance that at least partially is present in amorphous form with a mean particle size of at least 0.01 μm such as, for example, from 0.01 μm to 500 μm, from 0.05 μm to 500 μm, from 0.1 μm to 500 μm, from 0.5 μm to 500 μm, 1 μm to 500 μm, typically from 0.5 μm to 300 μm, more typically from 1 μm to 200 μm, especially from 1 μm to 100 μm. An immediate release composition according to the invention containing a drug substance is typically for oral administration. Due to the possibility of controlling the release rate of the drug substance, the immediate release composition may be adapted for oral administration 1-6 times a day, normally 1-4 times daily such as 1-3 times, 1-2 times or once daily. Pharmaceutical Compositions A number of pharmaceutical compositions were developed to reduce the likelihood of improper administration of drugs in combination with alcohol, especially drugs such as opioids or combinations of opioids and relevant drug compounds such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. In general drug substances belonging to the group analgesics, antipyretics or CNS drug substances are of interest. Specific examples are mentioned above. The drug substance or combination of drug substances may be dispersed in the immediate release composition and, especially in those cases where the immediate release composition contains a polyglycol, the composition is a matrix composition. The immediate release composition according to the invention has a lower solubility and/or release rate in alcohol containing media (for example ethanol) than in aqueous media (for example water, buffer, hydrochloride solution). As demonstrated in the examples herein, the alcohol containing medium may include, for example ethanol in a wide concentration range. Thus, the medium may contain from 2.5% v/v to 80% v/v of alcohol, the remaining part being a water-based medium (i.e. water, aqueous buffer or hydrochloride solution). More specifically, the invention relates to the use of a polymer and a drug substance for the preparation of an immediate release composition that is without alcohol induced dose dumping. Typically, the solubility or release rate of the immediate release composition is lower in alcohol than that in aqueous media. More specifically, the solubility or release is at least 1.5 times lower, at least 2 times lower in alcohol than in aqueous media, notably 5 times, 10 times, 25 times, 50 times or 100 times lower. As illustrated in the Examples herein, an immediate release composition of the invention may be a coated matrix composition. The release from such an immediate release composition may be governed by erosion of a specific surface. Erosion based release from a matrix composition depends on the exposed area of the matrix. In this case the area may be manipulated by employment of a coat that is not subject to erosion and thus covering the areas of the matrix that hence will not be a releasing site. For such immediate release compositions the geometric form of the composition is very important for the achieving a desired rate of release. Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, the matrix composition has a geometric shape, which enables a substantially constant surface area to become exposed during erosion of the matrix. In a specific example, the matrix compositions employed are coated in such a manner that the surface has a substantially constant or controlled surface area during release or erosion. In the present context controlled surface area relates to a predetermined surface area typically predicted from the shape of the coat of the unit dosage system. It may have a simple uniform cylindrical shape or the cylindrical form can have one or more tapered ends in order to decrease (or increase) the initial release period. As another example, in diffusion based immediate release compositions the release will furthermore depend on the thickness of the diffusion layer and in this case the release will depend both on the diffusion area and thickness of the diffusion composition. As yet another example the release mechanism of dissolving/solubilisation also depends on the releasing area and the release rate and may be controlled by covering parts of the releasing matrix composition by a coat. The immediate release composition may be partly covered by a coat with specific properties in such a way that the exposed area of the matrix may be controlled by the use of a coat. Controlling the coverage of the immediate release composition by the coat hence preferably refers to covering from 0 to 99% w/w of the composition by a coat. An immediate release composition of the invention is normally prepared for oral intake, preferably for oral intake by swallowing. Accordingly, the size of the immediate release composition should be in a range that allows oral intake by swallowing. In the following are given illustrative examples of the invention. More specific examples are mentioned in the Examples herein. In general, the concentration of the polyglycol is from 5% w/w to 90% w/w, the concentration of the drug substance depends on the amount required to have a dose; thus the amount of high potency drug substances is much less than a low potency drug substance. A person skilled in the art is able to find information of suitable doses and adjust the immediate release composition to that effect. Normally, the concentrations of polyglycol and inert pharmaceutically active excipients are lower for immediate release compositions containing a low potency drug substance than for immediate release compositions containing a high potency drug substance. Geometry Preferably, the immediate release compositions of the invention are cylindrical compositions optionally with tapered end(s). It follows that the matrix composition also preferably is of a cylindrical shape (optionally with tapered end(s)), which preferably is surrounded by a coating having at least one opening exposing one surface of said matrix. The cylindrical shape may be any geometrical shape having the same cross section area throughout the length of the geometrical shape. Within the present context, cross sections are perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder. By way of example, if the cylindrical shape is elongated then the cross sections are perpendicular to the longitudinal axis. Preferably, the cylindrical shape is elongated. The cross section of a cylinder within the meaning of the present invention may have any two-dimensional shape, for example the cross section may be circular, oval, parabola, hyperbola, rectangular, triangular, otherwise angular, star shaped or an irregular shape. The immediate release compositions according to the invention preferably have a cylindrical shape, wherein the end(s) may be tapered. Accordingly, the cylindrical shape may for example be an elliptic cylinder, a parabolic cylinder, a hyperbolic cylinder or a prism. A prism within the present context is a cylinder whose cross-section is a polygon. The immediate release composition as well as the matrix composition according to the invention may be a cylindrical shape with one tapered end or two tapered ends. Preferably, the matrix composition is being surrounded by a coating having at least one opening, for example one opening, such as two openings each exposing one surface of said matrix. Preferably, said at least one opening is exposing one end of the cylindrical shape, more preferably the coating has two openings each exposing an end of the cylindrical shape. Coating The immediate release composition may be partly covered by a coat with specific properties in such a way that the exposed area of the matrix may be controlled by the use of a coat. For the present purpose, it is important to ensure that the coating is impermeable to an aqueous medium, such as water. This ensures that the matrix is only in contact with the surrounding aqueous media via the openings in the coating. In addition it is preferred that the coating is also substantially insoluble in an aqueous medium; preferably the coating is insoluble in an aqueous medium. In a specific example the coating is substantially insoluble, non-erodable and impermeable to aqueous media leaving only the exposed areas of the matrix for release. Within the present context, the coating is considered substantially insoluble in an aqueous medium if the coating dissolves so much slower in an aqueous medium than the matrix composition that the coating remains intact until the matrix has eroded and/or released the active drug substance. In an embodiment of the invention, the coating biodegrades, disintegrates crumbles, or dissolves after erosion of the matrix and/or during the release of the drug substance. In certain embodiments, a coating applied to a matrix composition as described herein will remain intact as long as it is supported by the matrix composition containing the drug substance. In specific embodiments, the coating may be is formulated to lose the ability to remain intact after erosion of the matrix composition. For example, the coating may be formulated to biodegrades, disintegrates or crumbles upon erosion of the matrix composition, so that the coating will not remain in a subject to whom the immediate release composition is administered, for example, a human, for any significant amount of time after the complete erosion of the matrix and the release of the drug substance. In a one embodiment, the coating may biodegrade, disintegrate, crumble or dissolve after erosion of the matrix composition and/or during the release of the drug substance in the matrix composition. The coating may in general comprise or even consist of one or more polymers. Polymers suited for forming the coating that substantially covers the matrix composition may be selected from thermoplastic polymers. In one embodiment, the coating is formed entirely of thermoplastic polymers. Thus, in one embodiment of the invention all the polymers included in the coating are thermoplastic polymers. As used herein, the term “thermoplastic polymer” refers to polymer(s) that is/are an elastic and flexible liquid when heated, but freezes to a solid state when cooled (for example, cooled to 20° C. or to ambient temperature). The coating may be made of a material comprising one or more of the polymers described herein in this section, such as, for example, a material comprising one or more starch based polymers, one or more cellulose based polymers, one or more synthetic polymers, one or more biodegradable polymers or a combination thereof, such as mixtures of starch and synthetic polymers or mixtures of starch and biodegradable polymers. In certain embodiments, the coating may be made of a material comprising one or more polymers selected from Ethyl cellulose grade 20 and 100, polylactic acid (PLA), Cornpack 200, polycaprolactone, PEO 7000000 and polyhydroxybuturate. Starch Based Polymers The coating may comprise one or more starch based polymers. The starch based polymer may be starch as such or a polymer having a high starch content, preferably more than 70%, such as more than 80%, for example more than 90%. Starch is a linear polysaccaride made up of repeating glucose groups with glycosidic linkages in the 1-4 carbon positions with chain lengths of 500 to 2,000 glucose units. There are two major polymer molecules in starch—amylose and amylopectin. The starch based polymers to be used according to the present invention may preferably be thermoplastic starch biodegradable plastics (TPS). TPS have a starch (amylose) content greater than 70% and are in general based on gelatinized vegetable starch. Said vegetable starch may for example be selected from potato starch, rice starch, maize starch, tapioca starch, wheat starch, dextrin, carrageenan and chitosan. Said vegetable starch may also as such be suitable polymers used in the coating composition. The group of starch based polymer in general do not have a specified melting point, but changes phase within a temperature range of 90° C. to 260° C. typically depending upon the chain length of the starch based polymer, water content, and their branching and added side-groups as does the degree of crystallinity of the starch. Long chained-starches are usually completely amorphous, while shorter length starches may be semi-crystalline (20-80% crystalline). Long polymer chains are preferable because it contributes to the hardness, while not being too brittle. Starch-based polymers are in general fully biodegradable as they are product of plant materials. The degradation rate varies and can be further induced by addition of other biodegradable polymers as listed herein. One example of a preferred starch based polymer, which may be comprised in the coating or coating according to the present description is maize starch. Maize starch is a linear polysaccaride made up of repeating glucose groups with glycosidic linkages in the 1-4 carbon positions with chain lengths of 500 to 2,000 glucose units. There are two major polymer molecules in starch—amylose and amylopectin. A preferred maize starch is cornpack. Cornpack is the maize starch used in some examples described herein below. Starch is widely used in food and pharmaceutical industry as binder and dilluent. It is edible and essentially nontoxic. Starch is in general cheap and obtains a good hardness when molded and thermoformed. Starch may in general also be reheated several times without losing its thermodynamic properties. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, the coating comprises at least one starch based polymer, and more preferably a starch, because starch may be a great advantage when applying injection molding or co-extrusion as a production process. Starch based polymers are in general decomposable, and usually have a fast disintegration rate, especially in mixture with biodegradable polymers. These polymers are in generally recognized as stabile and inert in solid dosage forms. Cellulose Based Polymers The coating may also comprise one or more cellulose based polymers. In certain embodiments of the invention the coating may even consist of one or more cellulose based polymers (such as ethyl cellulose) and plasticizers (such as any of the plasticizers described in this section below) and UV stabilizers (such as any of the UV stabilizers described in this section below). Cellulose based polymers are useful in the coating composition because cellulose based polymers for example ethyl cellulose (particularly grade 100-300) frequently have increased hardness and high ductility. Therefore the coatings used over the matrix composition may include a cellulose based polymer. Where a cellulose based polymer is used in the coating, it is preferably a cellulose based polymer that is substantially insoluble or insoluble in an aqueous medium. Suitable cellulose based polymers include cellulose polymers wherein one or more of the free —OH groups have been substituted with an R-group to form a —O—R group. In this context, R may be, for example, a linear or branched lower alkyl, linear or branched lower alkyl-OH, linear or branched lower alkyl-COOH, —CO-(linear or branched lower alkyl), nitrate, aromatic rings or combinations of the aforementioned. Lower alkyl is preferably a C1-10 alkyl, more preferably C1-6 alkyl. Accordingly, where a cellulose based polymer is used in a coating as described herein, the cellulose based polymer may, for example, be one or more selected from ethyl-cellulose, cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate, cellulose nitrate, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose and salts thereof, cellulose acetate phthalate, ethylhydroxy-ethylcellulose, ethylmethylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, hydroxyethylmethyl-cellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxymethyl-cellulose and hydroxymethylpropylcellulose and cellulose acetate. The coating may also comprise one or more cellulose based polymers selected from cellulose acetate, cellulose propionate, silicified microcrystalline cellulose, cellulose nitrate, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose and salts thereof, cellulose acetate phthalate, microcrystalline cellulose, ethylhydroxyethylcellulose, ethylmethylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxyethylmethylcellulose, hydroxylpropylcellulose, hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose phthalate, hydroxymethylcellulose and hydroxymethylpropylcellulose, cellulose acetate, ceratonia(high molecular-weight 310 000). Cellulose based polymers are in general fully biodegradable, as they are typically products of plant materials. The degradation rate of cellulose based polymers is generally slower than for starch based polymers. The degradation rate of cellulose based polymers, however, can be induced by addition of other biodegradable polymers as listed herein. Such additional polymers may be polymers susceptible to degradation by one or more microorganisms, which can result in quicker degradation of the coating composition into smaller pieces, giving rise to an increased surface area, and, thereby, resulting in faster degradation. It is especially preferred that the coating comprises ethyl cellulose. Ethyl cellulose is a long-chain polymer of β-anhydroglucose units joined together by acetal linkages, in which some of the hydroxyl groups on the repeating glucose units have been converted to ethoxy groups. Ethyl cellulose has the generic formula C12H23O6(C12H22O5)nC12H23O5 where n can vary to provide a wide variety of molecular weights. Ethyl cellulose comes in different grades which vary in molecular weight and number of ethoxy groups. Grades from 20-300 are suitable for use in the present context and are also readily commercially available. Grades with high molecular weights tend to be preferred because they are optimal to give a hard coating. The coating may comprise one or more ethyl celluloses with different grades, for example one ethyl cellulose with a grade of in the range of 20 to 300, preferably in the range of 20 to 100, more preferably in the range of 20 to 40, such as 20 and another ethyl cellulose with a grade of in the range of 20 to 300, preferably in the range of 50 to 200, more preferably in the range of 80 to 120, such as 100. Ethyl cellulose generally has a glass transition temperature within 129-133° C. These polymers are widely used in food and pharmaceutical industry as coater, stabilizer, matrix former and taste masking and are regarded as non toxic substances. Cellulose based polymers are in general derived from plant material and may subsequently be modified. Many cellulose based polymers are cheap and give a good hardness when molded and thermoformed. As derivatives of plants, cellulose based polymers are in general easily decomposable when disposed. These polymers tend to be stable and inert in solid dosage. Synthetic Polymers The coating according to the invention may also comprise one or more synthetic polymers. Suitable synthetic polymers for use in the coating composition may, for example, be one or more selected from polyamide, polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene, polyurethane, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl butural, Eudragit L methyl ester, Eudragit RL and Eudragit E. polyvinyl chloride, silicone rubber, latex, teflon, copolymers such as ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), styrene-butadienestyrene (SBS) and styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS), Polyethylene glycols, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene oxide (ranging in molecular weights 100,000 to 8,000,000), carboxymethylene (Carbomer) and sugars thereof (for example allylsucrose,) and co-polymers of ethylene and propylene oxide (PoloXamer). Biodegradable Polymers Biodegradation is the process by which microorganisms (microbes such as bacteria, fungi or algae) convert materials into biomass, carbon dioxide and water. Biomass is a general term used to refer to the cells of the microorganisms that are using the material as a carbon source to grow on. The coating may also comprise one or more biodegradable polymers. Said bio-degradable polymer(s) may be one or more selected from starch based polymers as described herein above in this section and cellulose based polymers as described herein above in this section. However, the biodegradable polymer may also one or more selected from polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), polyhydroxyvalerate (PHV), poly-hydroxyvalerate-co-hydroxyvalerate (PHV/VH), Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), poly-3-hydroxy-5-phenylvalerate (PHPV), aliphatic polyesters, polycaprolactone (PCL), polylactic acid (PLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), copolymers or block copolymers of poly-caprolactone (PCL), polylactic acid (PLA) and/or polyglycolic acid (PGA), poly-propylene carbonate (PPC), polyester amide (PEA), polybutylene succinate adipate (PBSA), polybutylene adipate co-terephtalate (PBAT) and polybutylene succinate-adipate (PESA). Copolymers or block copolymers of polycaprolactone (PCL), polylactic acid (PLA) and/or polyglycolic acid (PGA) may, for example, be selected from, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), polylactic acid and epsilon-caprolactone copolymer (PLA/CL) and polylactic acid/glycolic acid polymers) (PLA/GA), which are all commercially available. In one embodiment, the coating comprises one or more biodegradable polymers selected from polylactic acid (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyhydroxy-butyrate (PHB). In one such embodiment, the coating comprises both polylactic acid (PLA), polycaprolactone (PCL) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). The use of polycaprolactone and other polymers in this group has been increased over the last decade, while the demand for environmental friendly plastics has grown. These polymers are regarded as nontoxic and are already used in parenteral pharmaceutical formulations. The advantages of these polymers are their ability to make a more flexible coating when molded in mixture with starch derived polymers. The somewhat rigid structure of pure thermoplastic starch is improved. Furthermore the polymers are decomposable and disintegrate by microorganisms. Polylactic Acid Polylactic acid or polylactide (PLA) is a biodegradable, thermoplastic, aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources, such as corn starch. PLA belongs to the chemical family of polyesters, such as for example ε-caprolactone. PLA-caprolactone contains PLA in different ratios from 15% PLA to 100% (such as 25, 35, 50, 75, 85%), polyglycolides, polyglycolic acids (PGA) and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) in different ratios from 15 to 100% PLA (such as 25, 35, 50, 75, 85%), poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-OH in different ratios from 15% PLA to 100% (such as 25, 35, 50, 75, 85%). Each of the before mentioned polymers exist in L or D-form (making them optically active) and in equal amounts (1:1) of L- and D-forms results in an amorphous mixture, while the L- or D-form all possess a certain degree of crystallinity. The degree of crystallinity is highly related to the mechanical properties (incl. processability), physico-chemical properties related to particularly stability of the polymer. A high degree of crystallinity provides hardness, and possibly, more brittleness. This may affect the processability as well, as highly crystalline materials have a high melting temperature and therefore processing temperature, while amorphous esters have a lower melting temperature and thus a lower processing temperature. Moreover, an increased degree of crystallinity implies that the material is more thermodynamically stable, which leads to a longer shelf-life. Materials with a lower degree of crystallinity or amorphous materials are usually softer with a lower processing temperature. The drawback of amorphous materials or materials with a lower degree of crystallinity is that their physicochemical stability is lower as the material is in a thermodynamically unstable state. Regarding PLA, it is necessary to find the optimal degree of crystallinity. Each degree of crystallinity has different mechanical properties, thus its adhesion to the matrix will vary depending on the degree of crystallinity of the given material (PLA). The skeletal structure of PLA is shown below. Due to the chiral nature of lactic acid, several distinct forms of polylactide exist: poly-L-lactide (PLA in its L-form, see below figure) referred to as PLLA is the product resulting from polymerization of L,L-lactide (also known as L-lactide), and poly-D-lactide (PLA in its D-form) referred to as PDLA is the product resulting from polymerization of D-lactide. Furthermore, PLLA and PDLA may be mixed using various ratios of the two stereo forms. As the L-form has stronger mechanical properties than the D-form, blends of the L- and D-forms can be prepared which have different morphological properties eg. by adding the D-form to the L-form in amounts of, for example, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40% w/w up to a ratio of 1:1, consequently making the material completely amorphous, however it may also form a highly regular stereo complex with increased crystallinity, since addition of PDLA increases the molecular energy of the mixture by forming a concentration gradient. Depending on the extent/magnitude of the temperature gradient, it may induce slow nucleation and hence crystallization. On the other hand, it may as well induce a nucleation with an incontrollable nucleation rate, which leads to an amorphous state. PLA has in its L-form (PLLA) a crystallinity of around 35-45%, a glass transition temperature between 35-80° C. and a melting temperature between 173-178° C. Due to the structure of PLA, PLA may be exposed to hydrolysis during its path through the gastro-intestinal tract, however PLA is impermeable and insoluble in aqueous media and in relation to applying PLA as shell material, it has been demonstrated that the shell at least macroscopically is intact within the first 48 hours of exposure. Furthermore, the possible degradation product of PLA is merely lactic acid. Polyglycols The coating may comprise any of the above-mentioned polyglycols in a form that erodes at a substantially slower rate than the matrix composition. The coating may thus be one which is eroded in an aqueous medium at a substantially slower rate than the matrix composition comprising the active drug substance, whereby the area of the matrix composition comprising the active drug substance that is exposed during erosion and/or release of the matrix composition is substantially controlled, and whereby the coating is substantially eroded upon erosion and/or release of the matrix composition comprising the active drug substance. Such a coating can be designed so that its longitudinal erosion rate is substantially the same as the longitudinal erosion and/or release rate of the matrix, whereby the matrix and the coating will erode longitudinally towards the centre of the composition at substantially the same rate. Thus, when the matrix composition has been completely eroded and/or released by the aqueous medium, the coating will also be substantially completely eroded. A matrix composition having such a coating has the obvious advantage of being completely biodegraded upon release of the active drug substance. A polyglycol suitable for use within the coating is high molecular weight PEO, such as, for example, PEO with an average molecular weight which is significantly higher than the average molecular weight of any of the PEOs contained in the matrix composition. Thus, where the coating composition includes a PEO, the PEO contained in the coating can be selected to have a significantly higher average molecular weight than any PEO contained in the matrix. Examples of PEO materials suited to use in the coating include, for example, one or more PEO with an average molecular weight selected from at least 900,000, at least 2,000,000, at least 4,000,000, at least 6,000,000, or at least 7,000,000. Mixtures of Polymers As noted herein above the coating may comprise one or more different polymers, and in particular one or more different polymers selected from starch based polymers, cellulose based polymers, synthetic polymers and biodegradable polymers, in particular from any of the starch based polymers, cellulose based polymers, synthetic polymers and biodegradable polymers described herein above in this section. In one embodiment of the invention, the coating comprises polymers selected from or even that all polymers of the coating are selected from starch based polymer and biodegradable polymers, such as from any of the starch based polymers and bio-degradable polymers described herein above in this section. In particular, bio-degradeable polymers such as polycaprolactone, polyhydroxybuturate, polyhydroxy-valerate, polylactic acid, polyhydroxyalkanoates and/or polypropylene carbonate can be blended with various starches (such as any of the starches described herein above in this section) in different ratios. Suitable mixtures for use in the coating composition are for example polycaprolactone and sago and/or cassava starch, polycaprolactone or polyhydroxybuturate and pre-dried, thermoplastic starch, polycaprolactone and gelatinized starch or thermoplastic starch. Other suitable mixtures are starch-based blends with biodegradable thermoplastic components like polyester amide, polyhydroxybuturate-co-valerate or polybutylene succinate-adipate. Polymers starches can be cross-linked with maleic anhydride (MA) and dicumyl peroxide (DCP) giving harder items when molded and thermoformed. In another embodiment, the coating comprises polymers selected from the starch based polymer and synthetic polymers described herein above in this section. In particular, suitable mixtures for use in the coating composition include, for example, native granular starch, modified starch, plasticized starch blended or grafted with many synthetic polymers such as polyethylene, polystyrene, Purified Terephthalic acid (PTA), optionally in mixture with aliphatic polyesters or polyvinyl alcohols in different ratios. Polybutylene succinate (PBS), polybutylene succinate adipate in blend with various starches in different ratios are also suitable, such as, for example, Polybutylene succinate in mixture with thermoplastic starch, alkylene oxide modified starches in combination with hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol. In yet another embodiment, the coating comprises polymers selected from the cellulose based polymers and biodegradable polymers described herein above in this section. Thus, the coating may for example comprise a mixture of PLA and ethyl cellulose. In one embodiment the coating even consists of PLA, ethyl cellulose, one or more plasticizers (such as any of the plasticizers described herein below) and one or more UV stabilizers (such as any of the UV stabilizers described herein below). UV Stabiliser Radiation from sunlight can accelerate the degradation of plastics, such as the coating according to the invention. The packaging material to protect the immediate release compositions (for example tablets) from direct sunlight may not provide sufficient protection. Especially for a coating with high concentration of biodegradable polymers, it can be relevant to add UV-stabilizers to the compositions, due to the many unsaturated functional groups (eg. carbonyl groups). UV-stabilizers could for example be titanium dioxide, metal complexes with sulfur containing groups, hindered amine light stabilisers (HALS), benzophenones, benzotriazoles. Titanium dioxide is already widely used in pharmaceutical preparations as pigment and is considered non toxic.

In a preferred embodiment, the coating is made of a material wherein the concentration of plasticizer is from 0 to 30% w/w. Accordingly it is preferred that the coating comprises or even consists of one or more plasticizer(s) and one or more polymer(s). Furthermore, the coating may comprise sweetening agents, flavouring agents and/or colouring agents, which may be any of the sweetening agents, flavouring agents and/or colouring agents described herein. The coating may be made of a material comprising one polymer, and wherein the concentration of the polymer is from 5% w/w to 100% w/w.

Outer Coat In some cases the immediate release composition of the present invention may also comprise an outer coat that fully covers the composition, i.e. the matrix and the coating. Said outer coat may be selected from taste masking coats, coats with aqueous moisture barriers and/or oxidative barriers to improve the stability of the immediate release composition, and cosmetic coats for example a coat containing colouring agents, sweetening agents and/or flavouring agents in order to provide an elegant and palatable tablet and/or to provide easily distinguishable dose strengths.

Preferably, the outer coat is easily soluble in aqueous media in order to provide that the matrix comes in contact with the surrounding aqueous media via the openings in the coating immediately after administration. Preparation The immediate release composition as well as the matrix composition of the invention may be produced by various methods which are either known per se in the pharmaceutical industry or which, for example, are used in the production of polymer-based materials, depending upon the desired embodiment and the materials employed in the immediate release composition in question. One advantage of the immediate release composition according to the invention is that it may be produced by methods which are relatively simple and inexpensive. Suitable preparation methods for immediate release compositions according to the invention include extrusion, injection moulding, melt-processing, tabletting, capsule filling, thermoforming, spray coating, micro encapsulation and other methods of preparing immediate release compositions. Also a combination of one or more of the aforementioned methods may be employed. Immediate release compositions according to the invention may be prepared in numerous ways giving rise to different release mechanisms. Particularly the immediate release composition may be prepared by 1, 2 or multiple component injection mouldings, by conventional tablet compression, by micro encapsulation, by 1, 2 or multiple component extrusions, by capsule filling, by melt-processing or by thermoforming. The preparation may also comprise separate steps as for example wet granulation, dry granulation, melt granulation, pelletizing, spray coating, electrostatic coating or other forms of preparation methods. Definitions In the present context, the term “swellable” is intended to mean that the material increase/expand in size and volume as a result of contact with liquid. In the present context, the term “immediate release” denotes a composition that disintegrates within at the most 60 minutes such as, for example, at the most 30 minutes or at the most 15 minutes, when subjected to a disintegration test according to Ph. Eur. In the present context, the term “resistant to abuse by alcohol” is intended to mean that the in vitro dissolution behaviour of an immediate release composition of the invention is the same or shows a decreased release rate when the composition is tested in a dissolution medium. The ratio (R50) between t50% w/w (40% v/v ethanol in medium 1) and t50% w/w (medium 1) is 1.5 or more. t50% w/w (medium 1) denotes the time it takes to release 50% w/w of the drug substance from the immediate release composition in an in vitro dissolution test according to USP 32, NF 27, (711), Apparatus 2, paddle employing water optionally buffered/adjusted to a specific pH as dissolution medium (medium 1), and t50% w/w (40% v/v ethanol in medium 1) denotes the time it takes to release 50% w/w of the drug substance from the immediate release composition in an in vitro dissolution test according to USP 32, NF 27, (711), Apparatus 2, paddle employing 40% v/v ethanol in medium 1 as dissolution medium. The same may also apply for ratios determined for example when 25% w/w, 30% w/w, 40% w/w, 60% w/w, 70% w/w, 80% w/w, 90% w/w and/or 95% w/w has been released, the conditions being as described above. In the present context, the term “abuse” is intended to denote the use of a drug in order to induce euphoria or another excitement effect, i.e. the use is not intended to cure a disease or alleviate disease symptoms, but rather for obtaining intoxication. In the present context, the term “alcoholic beverage” is intended to mean a liquid or brew containing more than 4% v/v ethanol and the volume of an alcoholic beverage is 0.4 L or more. In the present context, the term “ingest 3 or more alcoholic beverages daily” is intended to mean that the subject on an average daily basis ingests liquid or brew with a total content of 100% v/v ethanol of 40 ml or more. The number of alcoholic beverages is not that important, it is the total amount of alcohol ingested daily that is important. The term “average daily basis” is determined as the total intake during a week divided by 7. The following methods and examples are intended to illustrate the invention and are not intended to limit the invention in any way. Experimental Dissolution Test Dissolution tests were performed in accordance with USP 32, NF 27, (711), Apparatus 2 (paddle method). The dissolution medium consisted of ethanol and/or phosphate buffer solution pH 6.8, or ethanol and/or hydrochloride solution pH 1.2. The volume of the dissolution medium was 900 ml and the rotation speed of the paddles was 50 rpm throughout the dissolution run. The temperature was 37° C. Samples were withdrawn at suitable time intervals and analysed for content of drug substance by means of UV-detector or HPLC with UV-detector at a wavelength relevant for the particular drug substance. In the case of Paracetamol (Acetaminophen) a relevant wavelength is 280 nm. In the case of morphine, a relevant wavelength is 284 nm. The specific drug substances analysed for are described in the examples herein. Methods A general method for the preparation of an immediate release pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention is described below. Preparation of a Matrix Composition An accurate amount of the polymer is weighed into a beaker followed by an accurate amount of the drug substance and of other pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s), if any. The mixing is performed on a magnetic stirrer at up to 800 rpm for a time period up to 20 minutes. The mixing is performed at room temperature throughout the mixing process. The mixture is now ready to be fed into an injection moulding machine. 3 g of the mixture is then fed into a table top injection moulding machine (Haake MiniJet II, Thermo Electron, Karlsruhe, Germany) and moulded directly into a pre-moulded shell with a weight of approximately 160 mg to receive a total tablet weight of approximately 350 mg. The settings applied in the MiniJet are: Temperature 40-65° C., pressure 150-800 bar and time 10-30 seconds. Preparation of the Coating/Shell Composition The coating composition is prepared by first adding the ethylcellulose then cetostearyl alcohol, and finally the titanium dioxide to a MTI-Mixer at room temperature. After mixing at around 1000 rpm the mixer is stopped when the temperature reaches 40-50° C. and the adhered material is manually incorporated into the mixture. The mixture is left to cool for about 10 minutes. The mixing is then finalized with a short high-speed mix in order to minimize lump formation. The mixture is then allowed to cool to room temperature, after which it had a suitable consistency for being fed into an injection moulding machine. The injection moulding machine used is Arburg Allrounder 420 V 800-60/35. Example of Coat Composition Batch: 08-0017-058 Material % (w/w) Ethocel 87 Cetostearyl Alcohol 12 TiO2 1 Total 100 Preparation of a Pharmaceutical Composition in Large Scale The shell and matrix are moulded in one process, where the shell is moulded in a first step and the matrix is moulded directly into the coat in a second step (co-moulding or 2 component moulding). The injection moulding machine used is Arburg Allrounder 420 V 800-60/35. In all the examples 1 to 21 the immediate release composition was 9 mm long, of cylindrical shape and with oval end surfaces.
