Step 1
3,6-Dibromocarbazole (32.5 g, 100 mmol) was reacted with isobutyl tosylate (22.8 g, 100 mmol) in DMF (100 mL) in the presence of K2CO3 (27.6 g, 200 mmol) at 100Â° C. for 24 h. The reaction mixture was poured into water (500 mL) to give white precipitate. The solid was filtered off, washed with water (100 mL) and recrystallized from methanol to give pure 3,6-dibromo-9-isobutyl-9H-carbazole (32.5 g, 85% yield).
