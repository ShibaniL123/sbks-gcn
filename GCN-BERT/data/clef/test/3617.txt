Technical Field The subject of the invention is the method of selective extraction of uranium and protactinium from irradiated in a nuclear reactor materials containing thorium, with the use of a sequence method of two columns of column chromatography. The invention can be utilised in nuclear power engineering for the aims of analysing thorium-uranium fuel cycle and marking in this fuel, both not used as well as burnt, the total content of uranium and its particular isotopes. It can be also utilised in the control of processes in nuclear reactors of the 4th generation in cases when thorium is used. Background Art Uranium is formed in the course of nuclear reactions of thorium: 232Th + n ------ 233Th --------- 233Pa ----------- 233U Up to now, for the aims of selecting uranium from thorium, liquid- liguid (solvent) extraction methods were used, which is a multi-level procedure, requiring use of a large amount of organic reagents and causes formation of a large amount of waste. US 3 825 649 A, US 2 789 878 A and US 3 227 516 A are using solvent extraction methods for selectively extracting uranium and protactinium from materials containing thorium. In US 3 434 809 A the separation of actinium and thorium from uranium values is carried out by an ion exchange process using a cation exchange resin. In M. Solache-Rios Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry, 2005, 165(3), 159-166, a combination of a solvent extraction process together with a ion-exchange process for the separation of Pa from carnotite is described. The presented way is much simpler as in the whole process, only one medium is used, i.e. the same mixture of acids, and a sequence of two chromatographic columns is used. Such process is easy for automation, which is essential in case of processing radioactive substances. Summary of invention The method of selective separation of uranium and protactinium from materials containing thorium, especially separating micro-amounts of uranium and protactinium from macro-amounts of other components containing thorium, especially ThO2, consists in dissolving a sample containing U, Th and Pa using a mixture of nitric acid, hydrofluoric acid and Al(NO3)3 in a hermetically closed vessel, made of polytetrafluoroethylene or derivatives of Teflon (PTFE, PFA). Next, the vessel is closed and heated in the temperature of 40-120oC for minimum 1 hour, after which the obtained clear solution is put onto a chromatographic column, filled with trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) adsorbed on a hydrophobic sorbent, favourably polystyrene-divinylbenzene, and elution is conducted, favourably of 50 ml solution which is a mixture of nitric and hydrofluoric acids with an addition of aluminium nitrate (favourably THOREX) at the flow rate of 0.2-10 mL/300 s, while at the column, 233Pa is quantitatively retained and the eluate from the column which contains Th and U is quantitatively moved to a vessel made of polytetrafluoroethylene or its analogues (PTFE or PFA) and evaporated to the volume of 0.5-5mL. Next, we add 0.5-5mL of H2O, and next, the obtained solution is put onto the column, filled with quaternary aliphatic amine and conduct an elution with a solution which is a mixture of nitric and hydrofluoric acids with an addition of aluminium nitrate with H2O, at the eluent flow rate of 0.2-10 mL/300 s, collecting fractions of volumes of 0.1-10mL, selectively separating U and Th. Uranium is eluted quantitatively in first five fractions, favourably four fractions (v=10 mL) and next, thorium in fractions 7-25 (v=39 mL). Brief description of drawings The way of separating micro-amounts of uranium and protactinium from macro-amounts of other components, especially Th, consists in dissolving a sample containing U, Th and Pa using solution of 13M HNO3 + 0.05 M HF + 0.1 M Al(NO3)3 in a hermetically closed vessel made of polytetrafluoroethylene or Teflon (PTFE, PFA). To 0.1 - 10 g of powdered ThO2, we add 10 mL - 50 mL of solution of 13 M HNO3 + 0.05 M HF + 0.1 M Al(NO3)3 (THOREX), close the vessel and heat in the temperature of 40-120°C, favourably 80°C for 1 to 24 hours, favourably for 1 hour. After that time, a clear solution is obtained. Next, the obtained solution is put onto a chromatographic column filled with trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) adsorbed on a hydrophobic sorbent, favourably BioBeads SM2, (Φ=0.285-2 cm2, h=0.5-15 cm), particularly (Φ =0.285 cm2, h=6 cm). Next, elution of 5-500 mL, favourably 50 mL of THOREX solution is conducted, at the flow rate of 0.2-10 mL/300 s, favourably 1 mL/300 s. Quantitatively retained 233Pa remains on the column. The eluate from the column containing Th and U is quantitatively moved to a beaker, made of polytetrafluoroethylene or Teflon (PTFE or PFA) and evaporated on a hot plate under a fume hood, up to a volume of 0.5-5mL, favourably 1 mL, after which we add 0.5-5mL of H2O, favourably 2mL H2O, and next, the obtained solution is put onto the column, filled with quaternary aliphatic amine, favourably TEVA, (Φ=0.285-2 cm2, h=0.5-15 cm) or (Φ = 0.285 cm2, h=6 cm). Next, we conduct elution with the THOREX solution + H2O, favourably THOREX + H2O 1 + 2, with the eluent flow rate of 0.2 - 10 mL/300 s, favourably 1 mL/300 s, collecting fractions of volumes of 0.1-10mL, favourably 2.5 mL. Selective separation of U and Th is achieved. Uranium is eluted quantitatively in first five fractions, favourably four fractions (v=10 mL) and next, thorium in fractions 7-25 (v=39 mL). Such elution sequence, when a desired component present in micro-amounts, i.e. U is eluted from the column at first, is very advantageous as there is no possibility of contaminating the uranium fraction, by a macro-component i.e. Th, caused by tailing. It is especially important as particular uranium isotopes are marked with the method of mass spectrometry, as it is necessary to avoid occurrence of isobaric interferences. The method of the invention is presented in an execution example and at pictorial figures. Description of embodiments Example: A sample containing U, Th and Pa is dissolved using solution of 13M HNO 3 + 0.05 M HF + 0.1 M Al(NO3)3 in a hermetically closed vessel, made of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). To 0.1 - 10 g of powdered ThO2, we add 50 mL of solution of 13 M HNO3 + 0.05 M HF + 0,1 M Al(NO3)3 (THOREX), close the vessel and heat in the temperature of 80°C for 1 hour. After that time, a clear solution is obtained. Next, the obtained solution is put onto a chromatographic column filled with trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) adsorbed on a hydrophobic sorbent BioBeads SM2, (Φ=0.285 cm2, h=6 cm). Next, elution of 50 mL of THOREX solution is conducted, at the flow rate of 1 mL/300 s. Quantitatively retained 233Pa remains on the column. The effluent from the column containing Th and U is quantitatively moved to a beaker, made of polytetrafluoroethylene and evaporated on a hot plate under a fume hood, up to a volume of 1 mL, after which we add 2mL of H2O, and next, the obtained solution is put onto the column, filled with quaternary aliphatic amine TEVA ( = 0.285 cm2, h=6 cm). Next, we conduct elution with the THOREX solution + H2O 1 + 2, with the eluent flow rate of 1 mL/300 s, collecting fractions of volumes of 2.5mL. Selective separation of U and Th is achieved. Uranium is eluted quantitatively in first five fractions, favourably four fractions (v=12.5 mL) and next, thorium in fraction 7-25 (v=39 mL). Such elution sequence, when a desired component present in micro-amounts, i.e. U is eluted from the column at first, is very advantageous as there is no possibility of contaminating the uranium fraction, by thorium which is a macro-component, caused by tailing. It is especially important as particular uranium isotopes are marked with the method of mass spectrometry, as it is necessary to avoid occurrence of isobaric interferences. The obtained results are pictorially presented in figures. Fig.1.
