Synthesis of N-(3-(2-((2-(methoxymethoxy)-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)phenyl) amino)-7-oxo-8(7H)pteridinyl)phenyl)acrylamide (Compound 9)
8-(3-aminophenyl)-2-((2-(methoxymethoxy)-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)phenyl)amin o)-7(8H)pteridinone(132 mg, 0.270 mmol) was weighed into a 25 mL round bottom flask. 4 mL of N-methylpyrrolidone was added and stirred in an ice bath. Acryloyl chloride (25 ÂµL, 0.297 mmol) was dissolved in 2 mL of acetonitrile and added dropwise to the reaction mixture with a constant pressure dropping funnel. Upon addition, the mixture was stirred for half an hour in an ice bath and then for 2 hours at room temperature. After the reaction was completed, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution was added to the reaction liquid and stirred for another 15 minutes. The rraction mixture was diluted with water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with deionized water and saturated sodium chloride solution. After concentration, the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (methylene chloride / methanol / aqueous ammonia = 100: 5: 0.5, v/v) to obtain N-(3-(2-((2-(methoxymethoxy)-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) phenyl)amino)-7-oxo-8(7H)pteridinyl)phenyl)acrylamide, orange solids 101 mg, yield 69%.
