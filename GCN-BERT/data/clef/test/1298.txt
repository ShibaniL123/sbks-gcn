BACKGROUND There are generally two types of swings that are known for use with swing sets or with other playground installations and/or in a residential setting: (i) conventional rectangular rigid swing seats or flexible strap-like swing seats meant to move on an arc in a back-and-forth motion; or (ii) tire swings that use a vehicle tire or like structure and that can twist and swing in any direction such as diagonal, circular, etc. These prior swings require the child or other user to pump his or her legs or otherwise shift their weight to move the swing, and require the user to maintain a sitting position and hold onto the swing or the rope(s) or chain(s) by which the swing is suspended. As such, these known swings have been found to have limited entertainment and enjoyment for certain children and other users that are not capable of maintaining the proper position on the swing and/or that are not capable of controlling the motion of the swing in the manner intended and required. Furthermore, these prior swings and others have been found to be deficient for a wide variety of other reasons including ease of manufacture, ease of installation, ease of use, durability, variety of modes of operation, safety, and other such attributes. As such, a need has been found for a new and improved swing.

The ballast chamber(s) M1,M2 can be located beneath the concave central seat portion (e.g., chamber M1) and/or within the peripheral edge 12 (e.g., chamber M2). The ballast material N can be permanently installed in the chambers M1,M2 or is selectively inserted into and removable from the chambers M1,M2. FIGS. 10 and 11 are isometric and top plan views of an alternative swing body B5 adapted for being suspended by the tether system T. Except as otherwise shown and/or described herein, the body B5 is identical to the body B described above, and like features relative to the body B are identified with like reference numbers that are 100 greater than those used in connection with the body B. The body B5 is preferably defined as a one-piece polymeric construction but is can be provided by a multi-piece assembly of polymeric and other materials. Instead of a circular peripheral wall 12 as used for the body B, the body B5 comprises a non-rectangular polygonal peripheral edge 112. As shown, the peripheral edge 112 is an octagon with 8 equal length linear sides, but the peripheral edge 112 can be defined with any other non-rectangular polygon shape using linear sides that are equal in length or unequal in length relative to each other. For example, the peripheral edge can define a trapezoid, pentagon, hexagon, octagon or other non-rectangular polygon shape. More particularly, the peripheral edge 112 comprises: (i) a top wall 112a that extends radially outward from the outermost or upper peripheral edge or lip RP of the seat recess R; and, (ii) an outer non-rectangular polygonal peripheral wall 112b connected to and projecting downwardly from an outer end of the top wall 112a. As shown in the section view of FIG. 10A, a peripheral groove 112g is defined under the top wall 112a adjacent the outer wall 112b, between the top wall 112a, the outer wall 112b, and the lower surface LS of the seat portion 110. The tether openings O1-O4 are each defined in the top wall 112a and each open through the top wall 112a into the peripheral groove 112g. A reinforcement ring RR defined from metal, fiber glass, wood, a polymeric material or other material is optionally located in the groove 112g to stiffen and strengthen the body B5, and the lower tethers LT1-LT4 (indicated generally at LT in FIG. 10A) are preferably wrapped and/or otherwise engaged with the reinforcement ring RR if the reinforcement ring is present in the groove 112g. In FIG. 10A, the reinforcement ring RR is shown as a tubular structure such as a metal tube. The swing body B5 is constructed such that the outer/upper peripheral edge or lip RP of the seat recess R is circular, where the seat recess R joins with the top wall 112a. The reinforcement ring RR can be circular as shown or can be otherwise shaped to fit in the groove 112g, e.g., defined in a non-rectangular polygonal shape that corresponds with the non-rectangular polygonal shape of the body peripheral wall 112b. FIGS. 12 and 13 are isometric and top plan views of an alternative swing body B5′ that is identical to the swing body B5 except as otherwise shown and/or described herein. Like components relative to the swing body B5 are identified with like reference numbers including a primed (') designation. With respect to the swing body B5′, the outer or upper peripheral edge or lip RP+ of the seat recess R′ is defined to have a non-rectangular polygonal shape that corresponds to the non-rectangular polygonal shape of the peripheral wall 112b′. Also, the swing body B5′ includes a beveled or rounded transition wall 112d′ that joins the top wall 112a′ of the peripheral edge 112′ to the outer wall 112b′, and this transition wall 112d′ provides added comfort to a user when moving onto and off of the recess R of the seat portion 110′. FIGS. 14 and 15 illustrate another alterative embodiment of a swing body B6 formed in accordance with the present development and adapted for being suspended by the tether system T. Except as otherwise shown and/or described herein, the body B6 is identical to the body B described above, and like features relative to the body B are identified with like reference numbers that are 200 greater than those used in connection with the body B. The body B6 is defined as a one-piece molded polymeric construction or is assembled from separate polymeric and/or other structures. Instead of a circular peripheral wall 12 as used for the body B, the body B6 comprises a non-circular curved peripheral wall 212. As shown, the peripheral wall 212 defines an oval, but the peripheral wall 212 can be defined with any other non-circular curved shape. More particularly, the peripheral wall 212 comprises: (i) a top wall 212a that extends radially outward from the outermost or upper peripheral edge or lip RP of the seat recess R; and, (ii) an outer oval or otherwise non-circular curved peripheral wall 212b connected to and projecting downwardly from an outer end of the top wall 212a. As shown in the section view of FIG. 14A, a peripheral groove 212g is defined under the top wall 212a adjacent the outer wall 212b, between the top wall 212a, the outer wall 212b, and the lower surface LS of the seat portion 210. The tether openings O1-O4 are each defined in the top wall 212a and each open through the top wall 212a into the peripheral groove 212g. A reinforcement ring RR defined from metal, fiber glass, wood, a polymeric material or other material is optionally located in the groove 212g to stiffen and strengthen the body B5, and the lower tethers LT1-LT4 (indicated generally at LT in FIG. 14A) are preferably wrapped and/or otherwise engaged with the reinforcement ring RR if the reinforcement ring is present in the groove 212g. In FIG. 14A, the reinforcement ring RR is shown as a tubular structure such as a metal tube. The swing body B6 is constructed such that the outer/upper peripheral edge or lip RP of the seat recess R is defined to match or correspond to the shape of the outer peripheral wall 212b, i.e., the outer/upper peripheral edge or lip RP of the recess R is defined to be oval in the illustrated embodiment. The reinforcement ring RR also defines a shape so that it fits in the groove 212g and, as such, the reinforcement ring RR is oval shaped in the illustrated embodiment.
