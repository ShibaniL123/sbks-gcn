Step 3
2-fluoro-N-(1-(4-fluorobenzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-yl)-2-methylpropan-1-amine
1-(4-fluorobenzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-amine 73c (200 mg, 1 mmol), 2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl trifluoromethanesulfonate 1b (448 mg, 2 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (384 mg, 3 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of 1,4-dioxane. The reaction solution was warmed up to 90Â°C and was stirred for 12 hours, then the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography with elution system A to obtain the title compound 2-fluoro-N-(1-(4-fluorobenzofuran-3-yl)propan-2-yl)-2-methylpropan-1-amine 73d (200 mg, yield 74%) as a yellow oil.
