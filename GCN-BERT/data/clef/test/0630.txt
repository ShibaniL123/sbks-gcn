In another embodiment, the method may comprise combining a starch, a dextrin, an optional film former, an optional binder, an optional processing aid and a spray dry fluid to form a spray dry composition, and spray drying the spray dry composition to form the opacity modifying agent. In some embodiments, the spray dry fluid may comprise water or preservatives. In an aspect, the disclosure provides a method of modifying the opacity of an edible substance such as a food substance. In some embodiments, the method may comprise contacting the edible or food substance with the opacity modifying agent or a suspension comprising the opacity modifying agent of this invention. In one embodiment, the opacity modifying agent is mixed with sugar syrup to provide a sugar syrup with increased opacity. The opacity modifying agents may be used in edible products such as food, pharmaceutical or nutraceutical applications. The edible products may be intended for use in mammals, including, without limitation, rodents, canines, felines, non-human primates, ungulates, and humans. The opacity modifying agents can be used in pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical dosage units. Suitable food products include, without limitation, cereal, panned goods, baked goods, extruded foods, pet treats, beverages, icings, syrups, gummies, hard candy, licorice, and the like. The opacity modifying agents may be coated onto the edible product, be dispersed throughout the edible product, or layered in the edible product. The opacity modifying agents may be used to modify the opacity of cosmetic products, personal care products, hair care products, paints, inks, plastics, leather and other surface treatments, and combinations thereof. Cosmetic products can include, but are not limited to, mascaras, pressed powder make-ups (e.g., eye shadows, cheek rouge and facial powders), liquid make-ups (e.g., eye shadows, foundations, cheek rouge, blushes, lip liners, eye liners and nail enamel), lipsticks, or combinations thereof. Personal care products can include, but are not limited to, lotions, creams, gels, toothpastes, or combinations thereof. Substances contacted by the disclosed opacity modifying agents exhibit high opacity. Lightness can be assessed by any suitable method, such as, for example, measuring the Lightness Index according to ASTM Method E313 with a D65/10° illumination source (referred to as “E313 [D65/10]”) using a LabScan™ XE spectrophotometer (available from HunterLab, Inc.). A sample can be prepared, for instance, by dispersing 5% by weight of an opacity modifying agent into a substance such as a sugar syrup comprising two-parts sucrose to one-part water by weight. A sample can also be prepared by coating a substrate with the aforementioned dispersion. A sample is loaded into the instrument's sample port and scanned, and the Lightness Index (E313 [D65/10]) value is calculated using measurements taken on the CIE L*a*b* color scale. The resulting Lightness Index value is used to assess lightness of the sample. Suitably, substances contacted by the disclosed opacity modifying agents can exhibit high E313 [D65/10] values of at least about 50, at least about 55, at least about 60, at least about 65, at least about 70, at least about 75, at least about 80, at least about 85, at least about 90, at least about 91, at least about 92, at least about 93, at least about 94, at least about 95, at least about 96, at least about 97, or at least about 98. Suitably, the disclosed opacity modifying agents can increase the E313 [D65/10] values of a food product upon contacting said product by at least about 5, at least about 10, at least about 15, at least about 20, at least about 25, at least about 30, at least about 35, at least about 40, at least about 45, at least about 50, at least about 55, at least about 60, at least about 65, at least about 70, at least about 75, at least about 80, at least about 85, at least about 90, at least about 95, at least about 96, or at least about 97. Opacity can be assessed by evaluating the Lightness Index achieved upon coating one or more colored substrate cores with film coatings as described herein. For example, when coating a colored substrate, the Lightness Index will increase with additional weight gain until high and/or full opacity is reached. Upon reaching high and/or full opacity, the Lightness Index may level off relative to further increases in weight gain. Suitably, the disclosed film coatings can suitably provide high and/or full opacity at a weight gain of less than about 10%, less than about 9%, less than about 8%, less than about 7%, less than about 6%, less than about 5%, or less than about 4%, at least about 0.01%, at least about 0.1%, at least about 0.5%, at least about 1%, at least about 2%, at least about 3%, or at least about 4% weight gain, for example, about 3% to about 10% weight gain. In some embodiments, the disclosed opacity modifying agent is present in amounts sufficient to provide full/high opacity at low weight gain. In some embodiments, substances contacted by the disclosed opacity modifying agents may exhibit an increase in L* as measured in reflectance mode or a decrease in L* as measured in transmission mode of at least about 0.01%, at least about 0.1%, at least about 0.2%, at least about 0.3%, at least about 0.4%, at least about 0.5%, at least about 0.6%, at least about 0.7%, at least about 0.8%, at least about 0.9%, at least about 1%, at least about 1.25%, at least about 1.5%, at least about 1.75%, at least about 2%, at least about 2.25%, at least about 2.5%, at least about 3%, at least about 3.5%, at least about 4%, at least about 4.5%, at least about 5%, at least about 6%, at least about 7%, at least about 8%, at least about 9%, at least about 10%, at least about 11%, at least about 12%, at least about 13%, at least about 14%, or at least about 15% compared with substances contacted by a corresponding starch in an amount by weight equal to the amount by weight of the agent or the amount by weight of the starch in the agent, but not contacted by a dextrin, a film former or a binder.

The compositions and suspensions described herein can be manufactured using techniques and equipment that are known and commonly used in the art. Manufacturing steps such as order of component addition, mixing temperatures (heating and/or cooling), mixing time, mixing speed, etc. can be driven by either by formulation or equipment requirements, or both. A number of parameters can be modified during the manufacturing process without substantial effect on the efficacy of the resulting product. The manufacturing methods and processes can further include separate steps for validating the resulting composition (e.g., the total amounts, ratios, and even distribution of components in the composition, etc.). The following examples are provided for illustrative purposes only and should not be construed as limiting.

Naked chocolate dragees were coated with each of the coating compositions to the same weight gain. Dragees coated with the composition containing Agent 4 exhibited slightly more opacity in the coating than dragees coated with the composition containing calcium carbonate. Dragees coated with the composition containing Agent 4 exhibited weaker opacity in the coating than dragees coated with the composition containing titanium dioxide. Example 11 Comparison with Fusion White Two kilograms of chocolate dragees were coated with a coating composition containing 3.1 g of FD&C Blue No. 1 in 1 kg of sugar syrup to produce blue coated dragees. Half of the blue coated dragees were coated by a hard panning method with 100 g of a composition containing 0.55% by weight of Agent 2-B of Example 2 and the remainder sugar syrup. The other half of the blue coated dragees were coated by a hard panning method with 100g of a composition containing 11% by weight of Fusion White and the remainder sugar syrup. FIG. 11 shows the comparative coating effect of blue coated dragees coated with Fusion White (left two columns, with dragees from top to bottom containing an increasing number of coats) versus the coating effect of blue coated dragees coated with Agent 2-B (right two columns, with dragees from top to bottom containing an increasing number coats). Visual inspection indicated that the coating effect was slightly improved in dragees coated with Agent 2-B over dragees coated with a comparable number of coats of Fusion white. However, the coating composition containing Fusion White was twenty-times more concentrated, indicating that Agent 2-B was at least twenty-times more effective as an opacity modifying agent as Fusion white. During panning with the composition containing Fusion White, there was significant development of dust, however, during panning with the composition containing Agent 2-B, there was no significant formation of dust. 1.
