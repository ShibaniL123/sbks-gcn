FLEXIBLE SHOE SOLE CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/467,807, filed March 25, 2011, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated herein by this reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION This disclosure relates generally to a sole for footwear and, more particularly, to a composite element for footwear and a method for making the same. BACKGROUND People need different amounts of support for their footwear depending on their characteristics, such as weight and gait, and upon the intended use of the footwear. For example, in some situations, such as during cross-training, it may be beneficial to have longitudinal and lateral support in the footwear. Alternatively, in some situations, such as sprinting, it may be beneficial to have longitudinal support, but not lateral support. In addition to providing footwear that meets a wearer’s support needs, the footwear needs to provide maximum performance and maintain comfort, efficiently transferring energy and providing flexibility. Furthermore, footwear needs to be lightweight and durable. For example, a bicyclist needs footwear that provides adequate support in the area surrounding the ball of the foot to reduce foot fatigue and provide flexibility both while bicycling and when dismounted from the bicycle. Additionally, the footwear needs to be lightweight and have the ability to flex according to the flexure of the wearer’s foot. Thus, there is a need for a sole support system that provides a wearer with the desired flexure characteristics while maintaining the desired level of performance and support. SUMMARY These and other needs are addressed by the various aspects, embodiments, and configurations of the present disclosure. This disclosure relates generally to footwear, more particularly to a footwear sole, and even more particularly to a footwear composite element and a method of manufacturing the same. Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to footwear utilizing a composite element with tuned rigidity. In one embodiment, an article of footwear includes a sole attached to a shoe upper. Some embodiments of the invention are a midsole, an outsole or an innersole of an article of footwear, comprising a composite element of the invention. Another embodiment of the invention is an article of footwear comprising a midsole, an outsole or an innersole comprising a composite element of the invention. Another embodiment of the invention is an article of footwear comprising a midsole, an outsole and an innersole, each comprising a composite element of the invention. In one embodiment, the first portion is positioned in a first region of a composite element, and the second portion is positioned in a second, different region of the composite element. In another embodiment, the first portion and the second portion are at least partially disposed within the same region of the composite element.

In one embodiment, the deformable portion and the substantially non-deformable portion each comprise a plurality of fiber-reinforced layers configured to provide a footwear sole with the desired flexure characteristics according to the characteristics of the wearer and the intended use. The orientation, the shape, the thickness, and/or the number of layers, for example, of each portion may be altered to provide the desired flexure characteristics for that portion of the composite element. In one embodiment, a composite element has at least one deformable toe region, arch region, and heel region having a first plurality of fiber-reinforced layers, and a substantially non-deformable forefoot region having a second plurality of fiber-reinforced layers. The forefoot region generally is positioned between the toe region and the arch region, and the arch region generally is positioned between the forefoot region and the heel region. The second plurality of fiber-reinforced layers may have a greater number of layers than the first plurality of fiber-reinforced layers. The first and second pluralities of fiber-reinforced layers may form the composite element. In one embodiment, an outsole may include at least one lug protruding distally from the outsole. The lug(s) may be an integral component of the outsole, or, alternatively, the lug(s) may be a separate component attached to the outsole. In addition, the position and composition of the lug(s) may vary. In yet another embodiment, an outsole may include a cleat attachment void, cut or drilled into the outsole to accommodate the attachment of a cleat.

In addition, embodiments may be associated with soles attached to a wide range of non-athletic footwear, including but not limited to work boots, sandals, loafers, and dress shoes. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention apply to footwear generally. Figs. 10-13 illustrate embodiments of a fiber-reinforced layer(s) that may be utilized to form a composite element. Figure 14 illustrates one embodiment of a method of manufacturing a composite element. Referring now to Figs. 2-4, embodiments of a composite element 14 joined to an outsole element 18 to form an outsole 22 are provided. As illustrated, the outsole 22 is divided into four general regions: a toe region 26 that generally corresponds with a wearer’s toes, a forefoot region 30 that generally corresponds with a wearer’s metatarsal bones and the joint between the metatarsal bones and the phalanges, an arch region 34 that generally corresponds with a wearer’s foot arch, and a heel region 38 that generally corresponds with a wearer’s foot heel. As illustrated, the forefoot region 30 is positioned between the toe region 26 and the arch region 34, and the arch region 34 is positioned between the forefoot region 30 and heel region 38. The depicted regions are not intended to demarcate precise areas of the composite element 14, the outsole element 18, or the outsole 22. Instead, the regions are intended to define general areas that aid in the following discussion. As illustrated, the composite element 14 and the outsole element 18 have been contoured to generally conform to the shape of a foot. Accordingly, the composite element 14 and/or the outsole element 18 may have a raised arch. Additionally, the composite element 14 and/or the outsole element 18 may have a raised peripheral area that extends around the sides of a foot. Further, the composite element 14 and/or the outsole element 18 may have a depression for receiving a heel. In some embodiments, the composite element 14 may be integrally formed with the outsole element 18, such as in Figs. 2-4, to provide additional stiffness. In other embodiments, the composite element 14 may be formed as a separate article and connected to the outsole element 18 using known methods of attachment, such as adhesives, molding, stitching, mechanical fasteners, and the like. In addition, the composite element 14 may be connected to the bottom surface of a midsole such that the composite element 14 is visible and, in some instances, accessible from the bottom of the article of footwear. The composite element 14 shown in Figs. 2-4 includes portions with different rigidities. For example, the composite element 14 includes a more rigid portion 42 associated with the forefoot region 30 of the composite element 14 and a less rigid portion 46 associated with the toe region 26, the forefoot region 30, the arch region 34, and the heel region 38 of the composite element 14. The more rigid portion 42 can be formed, for example, in various shapes and thicknesses to tune the flexure characteristics of the more rigid portion 42 with the wearer’s characteristics and the intended use of the footwear. The depicted more rigid portion 42 is formed in the shape of a shield when viewed from a distal viewpoint. Alternative shapes include, but are not limited to, circular, triangular, rectangular, trapezoidal, and combinations thereof. As shown in Fig. 2, the more rigid portion 42 has a greater thickness than the less rigid portion 46. In Fig. 2, the added thickness generally protrudes distally from the composite element 14. However, in alternative embodiments, the more rigid portion 42 may include a thickness that protrudes proximally from a less rigid portion 46 of the composite element 14 or protrudes proximally and distally from a less rigid portion 46 of the composite element 14. In some embodiments, a more rigid portion 42 may have the same thickness as a less rigid portion 46. In some embodiments, the more rigid portion 42 may be substantially rigid and substantially non-deformable. In Figs. 2-4, the size, shape, and thickness of the regions of the composite element 14 in the less rigid portion 46 of the composite element 14 is adjusted to vary the rigidity of the regions. For example, the altered size and shape of the toe region 26 in Fig. 4 provides a different rigidity, including torsional and/or bending, in the toe region 26 as compared to the other regions of the less rigid portion 46 of the composite element 14. In one embodiment, the less rigid portion 46 may be deformable. In another embodiment, the less rigid portion 46 may be deformable by torsional and/or shear stresses. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the outsole element 18 may contain one or more lugs 50 extending distally from the outsole element 18. The one or more lugs 50 may be an integral component of the outsole element 18, or, alternatively, the one or more lugs 50 may be a separate piece attached to the outsole element 18. Additionally, the position and composition of the one or more lugs 50 may vary depending on the type of footwear that the outsole element 18 will be incorporated into. For example, the one or more lugs 50 may be composed of a polymeric material. Additionally, the polymeric material of the one or more lugs 50 may differ from the polymeric material of the outsole element 18 when the one or more lugs is attached to rather than an integral component of the outsole element 18. In certain embodiments, the outsole element 18 is a polymeric material, comprising one or more of a homopolymer, copolymer, polymer alloy or a combination thereof, and wherein the polymeric material comprises one or more of vinyl esters, epoxies, polyolefins, polystyrenes, polyvinyls, polyacrylics, polyhalo-olefins, polydienes, polyoxides, polyesthers, polyacetals, polysulfides, polythioesters, polyamides, polythioamides, polyurethanes, polythiourethanes, polyureas, polythioureas, polyimides, polythioimides, polyanhydrides, polythianhydrides, polycarbonates, polythiocarbonates, polyimines, polysiloxanes, polysilanes, polyphosphazenes, polyketones, polythioketones, polysulfones, polysulfoxides, polysulfonates, polysulfoamides, polyphylenes, and combinations and/or mixtures thereof. The composite element 14 and the outsole element 18 in Figs. 2-4 can include several cleat attachment voids. For example, in the forefoot region 30 two slots 54 are provided and adapted to accommodate a bicycle pedal cleat. In this configuration, a more rigid portion 42 of the forefoot region provides a stiff interaction point to transfer energy from the outsole 22 to a bicycle pedal. Additionally, a cleat attachment void may be provided in one or both of the toe region 26 and the heel region 38. For example, in Figs. 2-4, apertures 58 are provided in the toe region 26 and the heel region 38. While the attachment voids are illustrated with reference to a bicycling shoe, it can be appreciated that the location and configuration of one orientation of the attachment voids will vary depending on the type of shoe. For example, a Nordic ski shoe can have a cleat attachment void different from a bicycling shoe. It can be further appreciated that the shoe may not include a cleat attachment void. Additionally, a second plurality of fiber-reinforced layers may be added to the toe and heel region of composite element 14 to provide extra rigidity to the areas surrounding a cleat attachment void. Further, as depicted in Fig. 3, an outsole 22 may include one or more depressed areas surrounding the proximal side of a cleat attachment void. The illustrated depressed areas 62 surround the slots 54 formed in the forefoot region 30 and the apertures 58 formed in the toe region 26. The depressed area 62 surrounding the slots 54 can be dimensioned to accommodate a bicycling cleat mounting plate, and the depressed area 62 surrounding the apertures 58 can be dimensioned to accommodate mounting plates for other types of cleats. Referring now to Fig. 5, a composite element 14 is depicted and divided into four general regions: a toe region 26 that generally corresponds with a wearer’s toes, a forefoot region 30 that generally corresponds with a wearer’s foot front sole, an arch region 34 that generally corresponds with a wearer’s foot arch, and a heel region 38 that generally corresponds with a wearer’s foot heel. As illustrated, the forefoot region 30 is positioned between the toe region 26 and the arch region 34, and the arch region 34 is positioned between the forefoot region 30 and the heel region 38. The depicted regions are not intended to demarcate precise areas of the composite element 14. According to certain embodiments, the composite element 14 may not include all of the indicated regions. Rather, the composite element 14 may include a toe region 26, a forefoot region 30, an arch region 34, or a heel region 38, individually or in any combination thereof. For example, in Fig. 9, the composite element 14 has a toe region 26, a forefoot region 30, and an arch region 34; however, the composite element 14 does not have a heel region 38. Additionally, the regions may vary in size and shape. For example, in Fig. 9, the toe region 26 is shaped in the form of a strip, rather than the typical curve-shape of a toe portion of a sole. Adjusting the size and shape of the various regions varies the rigidity of the regions. For example, the altered size and shape of the toe region 26 in Fig. 9 allows more torsional and/or bending deformation than the toe region 26 and heel region 38 shown in Fig. 5. Figs. 7-8 illustrate embodiments of a composite element 14 having a more rigid portion 42, which may be substantially rigid and non-deformable, and at least one less rigid portion 46, which may be deformable. As illustrated, the more rigid portion 42 is positioned in the forefoot region 30, whereas the less rigid portion 46 is positioned in one or more of the toe region 26, the arch region 34, and the heel region 38. In Fig. 8, the less rigid portion 46 is comprised of at least one fiber-reinforced layer 66 in the toe region 26, the arch region 34, and/or the heel region 38. The at least one fiber-reinforced layer 66 of the less rigid portion 46, as depicted in Fig. 8, may be configured to deform in response to normal wear as well as shear and torsional stresses, or any combination thereof. For example, where only moderate lateral, or transverse, loads are encountered, the at least one fiber-reinforced layer 66 of the less rigid portion 46 may have minimal stiffness, thereby increasing the flexibility of the less rigid portion 46 of the composite element 14, as shown in Fig. 8. Alternatively, where large lateral loads are encountered, the at least one fiber-reinforced layer 66 of the less rigid portion 46, as depicted in Fig. 8, may have increased stiffness. The more rigid portion 42 of the forefoot region 30 may include at least one fiber-reinforced layer 66 and at least one additional fiber-reinforced layer 70 to increase the stiffness of the forefoot region 30, as shown in Fig. 8. The additional stiffness improves energy and/or power transfer. For example, in a bicycling shoe, as in Fig. 7, a more rigid portion 42 may be positioned in the forefoot region 30 to increase energy and/or power transfer from the rider to the pedal. As illustrated, at least one additional fiber-reinforced layer 70 may be interposed with the at least one fiber-reinforced layer 66. In one embodiment, a more rigid portion 42 of the forefoot region 30 provides maximum energy and/or power transfer while the less rigid portion 46 of the toe region 26, the arch region 34, and the heel region 38 provides flexibility. This varying rigidity in various regions of a sole is particularly useful for many athletic and other shoes that need to transfer energy and/or power efficiently and/or need to provide protection and/or comfort to specific areas of a wearer’s foot. It can be appreciated that, the number and the stacking configuration, including orientation, of the fiber-reinforced layers 66 and 70, as depicted in Fig. 8, may be altered as desired. For example, the flexure characteristics of composite element 14 may be altered by varying the number of fiber-reinforced layers 66 and 70, the configuration and thickness of each layer 66 and 70, and the orientation of each layer 66 and 70. In this manner, the composite element 14 is adapted to the characteristics of the wearer and the intended use. In one embodiment, the at least one fiber-reinforced layer 66 has from about one to about four fiber-reinforced layers 66. As discussed above, depending on the configuration, the composite element 14 might not extend to or comprise all regions. Accordingly, in some configurations, the toe region 26, the forefoot region 30, the arch region 34, and the heel region 38, or any combination thereof, will not have a fiber-reinforced layer. Another factor affecting the flexure characteristics of the composite element 14 is the configuration and thickness of each fiber-reinforced layer. In certain embodiments, each fiber-reinforced layer comprises a resin component and a fiber-containing component. The resin component may include one or more of a homopolymer, copolymer, polymer alloy or a combination thereof, and wherein the polymeric material comprises one or more of vinyl esters, epoxies, polyolefins, polystyrenes, polyvinyls, polyacrylics, polyhalo-olefins, polydienes, polyoxides, polyesthers, polyacetals, polysulfides, polythioesters, polyamides, polythioamides, polyurethanes, polythiourethanes, polyureas, polythioureas, polyimides, polythioimides, polyanhydrides, polythianhydrides, polycarbonates, polythiocarbonates, polyimines, polysiloxanes, polysilanes, polyphosphazenes, polyketones, polythioketones, polysulfones, polysulfoxides, polysulfonates, polysulfoamides, polyphylenes, and combinations and/or mixtures thereof. The fiber-containing component may include single-walled carbon-nanotubes, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, graphene nanoribbons, carbon-fibers, glass fibers, rayon fibers, silk fibers, metal fibers, nylon fibers, olefin fibers, acrylic fibers, polyester fibers, aramid fibers, and combinations thereof. The fiber-containing component and the resin, alone or together, can determine the final rigidity of the composite. The fiber-containing component may contain fibers that are randomly oriented, unidirectionally oriented, layered, woven, or any combination thereof. Fig. 10 illustrates one embodiment of a fiber-reinforced layer 66 having a plurality of fibers 74 randomly oriented with respect to a line Α-Α. The random orientation of the fibers 74 can provide one or both longitudinal and transverse stiffness. Fig. 11 illustrates one embodiment of a composite element 14 having at least one fiber-reinforced layer 66 and at least one additional fiber-reinforced layer 70. A plurality of fibers 74 within the at least one fiber-reinforced layer 66 is substantially oriented at a first angle with respect to a longitudinal axis Α-Α that extends from the toe region to the heel region of the composite element 14. A plurality of fibers 74 within the at least one additional fiber-reinforced layer 70 is substantially oriented at a second, differing angle with respect to the longitudinal axis Α-Α. By altering the orientation of the reinforcing fibers 74 in different fiber-reinforced layers, each fiber-reinforced layer may have one or both of a different directional flexure characteristic and stiffness. By using multiple fiber reinforced layers, the longitudinal and transverse flexure characteristics of the composite element can be tailored for a specific activity in which the human wearer is expected to engage. As indicated, the stiffness of a composite element 14 can be tailored to specific applications by varying the number of the fiber-reinforced layers, as well as the angular orientations of the layers. Further, the flexure characteristics of the at least one fiber-reinforced layer 66 and the at least one additional fiber-reinforced layer 70 may customize the localized regional stiffness to accommodate a specific application. The particular flexure characteristic to be incorporated in any given article of footwear may be tuned to the wearer and/or activity the wearer is to be engaged in. Thus, in one embodiment, a fiber-reinforced layer 66 is oriented at a first predetermined angle with respect to another fiber-reinforced layer 66, and an additional fiber-reinforced layer 70 is oriented at a second predetermined angle with respect to a fiber-reinforced layer 66 and/or another additional fiber-reinforced layer 70. The layer(s) of the at least one fiber-reinforced layer 66 and the at least one additional fiber-reinforced layer 70 can be arranged at various offsets corresponding to rotations relative to the longitudinal axis Α-Α. For example, in one specific embodiment, the layer(s) of the at least one fiber-reinforced layer 66 is arranged at offsets corresponding to rotations of approximately 10 degrees from the longitudinal axis Α-Α, and the layer(s) of the at least one additional fiber-reinforced layer 70 is arranged at offsets corresponding to rotations of approximately 45 degrees from the longitudinal axis Α-Α. Accordingly, the fiber-reinforced layers can provide varying degrees of stiffness or alternatively flexibility in a specific region of a sole. One of skill in the art will appreciate that individual layers 66 and 70 may be oriented from 0 degrees to 180 degrees, in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, from the longitudinal axis A-A, depending on the desired flexure characteristics. Fig. 12 illustrates one embodiment of a fiber-reinforced layer 66 employing a woven fabric 78. The alignment and weave of the woven fabric 78 can provide strength and stiffness properties in certain portions of the composite element 14 and flexibility in other portions of the composite element 14. These variations in strength and stiffness between the portions of the composite element may be accomplished by varying the number of layers of fabric within the fiber-reinforced layer(s), or the orientation of the layers of fabric within the fiber-reinforced layer(s). Preferably, the strength and stiffness properties are about the forefoot region 30 and the flexibility is about one or more of the toe region 26, the arch region 34, and the heel region 38. The woven fabric 78 may include at least one fiber selected from single-walled carbon-nanotubes, multi-walled carbon nanotubes, graphene nanoribbons, carbon-fibers, metal fibers, glass fibers, rayon fibers, silk fibers, nylon fibers, olefin fibers, acrylic fibers, polyester fibers, and aramid fibers. The fibers making up the fabric may be adhered to at least one polymeric material. The polymeric material may comprise at least one of a vinyl ester, epoxy, polyolefin, polydiene, polyoxide, polyesther, polyamide, polythioamide, polyurethane, polyimide, polythioimide, polycarbonate, polythiocarbonate, polyketone, and polythioketone. Fig. 13 illustrates embodiments of a composite element 14 having at least one fiber-reinforced layer 66 and at least one additional fiber-reinforced layer 70. The fiber-reinforced layers may contain a woven fabric 78 having a bias. The woven fabric 78 within the at least one fiber-reinforced layer 66 can be substantially oriented at a first angle with respect to a longitudinal axis A-A. The woven fabric 78 within the at least one additional fiber-reinforced layers 70 can be substantially oriented at a second angle with respect to the longitudinal axis Α-Α. As discussed above in relation to Fig. 11, the orientation of the woven fabric within a fiber-reinforced layer, the number of fiber-reinforced layers, and the orientation of the fiber-reinforced layers may be adjusted for a particular wearer and intended use. This includes adjusting the relative flexure characteristics of a substantially deformable portion and a substantially non-deformable portion of the composite element 14. Fig. 14 illustrates a method 100 of forming a composite element 14 according to one embodiment of the present invention. With reference to Fig. 14 and Figs. 5-8, the method 100 comprises providing one or more sole prepreg layers (step 104) and one or more forefoot prepreg layers (step 108). Each prepreg layer can contain one or more fiber-reinforced layers. Each sole prepreg layer 66 has a forefoot region 30 and optionally at least one of a toe region 26, an arch region 34, and a heel region 38. The forefoot region 30 is positioned between the toe region 26 and the arch region 34, and the arch region 34 is positioned between the forefoot region 30 and heel region 38. At least one sole prepreg layer 66 and at least one forefoot prepreg layer 70 are positioned in a first mold (step 112), one on top of another to form a first assembly having each of the forefoot prepreg layers 70 positioned about the forefoot region 30 of the one or more sole prepreg layers 66. The hierarchy of sole prepreg layers 66 and forefoot prepreg layers 70 may vary. For example, several sole prepreg layers 66 may be stacked on top of each other before adding a forefoot prepreg layer 70 or vice versa. Additionally, several forefoot prepreg layers 70 may be stacked on top of each other before adding a sole prepreg layer 66. Then, heat or pressure, or a combination of both, are applied (step 116) to form a composite element 14, i.e., a laminate composite. Optionally, the composite element 14 could be molded to an outsole element 18 to form an outsole 22, as depicted, for example, in Fig. 3. Molding processes include cast, injection, reaction injection, compression, transfer, laminate, or combinations thereof. As depicted in Figs. 2 and 4, for example, one or more lugs 50 may be formed as an integral component of the outsole 18 during the molding step. Alternatively, one or more lugs 50 may be attached to the outsole 22 after the molding step. Additionally, one or more cleat attachment voids 54, 58 may be formed in the outsole 22. Additionally, this method may be used to form a midsole or an innersole.
