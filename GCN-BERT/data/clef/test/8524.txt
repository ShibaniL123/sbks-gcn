WEARING POINT ATTACHMENT FOR PLOUGH SHARE WITH ASYMMETRIC HOLE PATTERN An attachment system for a wearing point on a plough share is described, in which a holder for the wearing point is arranged to be attached to the plough share, and in which the holder forms a connection pin or a connection socket, and the wearing point forms a connection socket or a connection pin, and the connection pin and the connection socket are provided with complementary, cooperating guide portions. In agricultural implements of the plough type, replaceable wearing points are used to increase the durability of the front portion of a so-called plough share, that is to say the portion of a plough body that cuts loose a strip of soil from the underlying soil so that it may be lifted up and turned by the components of the plough body following behind. The wearing point may be screwed directly to the plough share, or it may be attached to the plough share via a holder, typically in the form of a quick-release attachment, in which the wearing point is wedged into the holder by stroke impact, for example of the kind described in the applicant's own Norwegian patent 332031. Owing to the fact that the wearing points have relatively short lives, the consumption of wearing points is high. It is therefore an advantage in terms of production and logistics if the same type of wearing points and, for the ploughs that use wearing points with quick-release couplings, also quick-release attachments can be used. In some ploughs the plough-share design is such that this is not feasible. This may be owing to the side edge of the plough share being provided with an edge portion projecting vertically upwards, possibly in combination with the wearing point being reversible, that is to say of a kind which, when the front end portion has been worn down, is turned so that the original, rearward end portion is turned into the working direction of the plough, projecting forwards from the front edge of the plough share. The consequence of this is typically that the hole pattern for the attachment bolts of the wearing point is asymmetric relative to the longitudinal axis of the wearing point, meaning that different wearing points, possibly different quick-release attachments, will have to be used for right- and left-hand plough bodies in a reversible plough. An example of such a design is found in ploughs from the firm of Kuhn S.A., FR-67706 Saverne, France. The invention has for its object to remedy or reduce at least one of the drawbacks of the prior art or at least provide a useful alternative to the prior art. s An attachment system for a replaceable wearing point on a plough share is provided, in which the hole pattern for attachment bolts is asymmetric; that is to say, has differing distances from the longitudinal axis of the wearing point. The attachment system includes a holder which is arranged on the plough share, and the wearing point and the holder are provided with cooperating guide elements that form a slidable fit of the ΐο socket-and-pin type for quick replacement of the wearing part without the use of fastening means or means other than a striking tool. The holder is provided with two groups of attachment-bolt holes, one or more attachment-bolt holes of which, typically a front attachment-bolt hole, is/are common to the two hole groups. The hole groups may be mirror-symmetric around a plane which, for example, coincides with the longiΐ5 tudinal axis of the holder or is parallel to a side edge of the plough share. When the two hole groups include one or more common attachment-bolt holes, the common attachment-bolt holes lie mirror-symmetrically around a plane which preferably coincides with the longitudinal axis of the holder. Alternatively, the centre axes of the common attachment-bolt holes may lie in a plane coinciding with the longitudinal axis 2ο of the holder. Accordingly, the holder is provided with a hole pattern in which a selection of holes correspond to the attachment-hole pattern of both a left-hand plough share and a right-hand plough share. It is not a condition that the left-hand plough share should be mirror-symmetric relative to the right-hand plough share. By such an arrangement of the attachment-bolt holes in the holder, the same holder 25 can be used on both left-hand and right-hand turning plough bodies in a reversible plough, and the advantage of allowing the number of variants of the wearing-pointfixing element to be limited to one for a particular plough product is thereby gained. In addition, the advantage of the same type of replaceable wearing point being usable for both left- and right-hand turning plough bodies is gained. 3ο The invention relates more specifically to an attachment system for a wearing point on a plough share, in which a holder for the wearing point is arranged to be fixed to the plough share, and in which the holder forms a connection pin or a connection socket, and the wearing point forms a connection socket or a connection pin, and the connection pin and the connection socket are provided with complementary, cooperating 35 guide portions, wherein the holder is provided with first and second bolt-hole groups, the first bolt-hole group being complementary to an attachment-hole group in a left-hand plough share, and the second bolt-hole group being complementary to an attachment-hole group in a right-hand plough share. At least two attachment-bolt holes may be arranged mirror-symmetricaily around a longitudinal axis through the holder. The bolt-hole groups may have at least one common bolt hole. The wearing point may be symmetric around a longitudinal axis through the wearing point, a horizontal projection of the longitudinal axis through the wearing point coinciding with a horizontal projection of a longitudinal axis through the attachment. Each bolt-hole group may consist of a first bolt hole and a second bolt hole, the first bolt hole being common to both bolt-hole groups. In what follows, an example of a preferred embodiment is described, which is visualized in the accompanying drawings, in which: Figure 1 shows a plan of a left-hand plough share with a prior-art wearing point, in which an attachment-hole pattern for the attachment screws of the wearing point is asymmetric relative to the longitudinal axis of the wearing point; Figure 2 shows a plan of a prior-art right-hand plough share corresponding to the plough share according to figure 1, but in which the wearing point has been removed for the sake of exposition; Figures 3a and 3b show plans of respectively a left-hand plough share and a right-hand plough share provided with symmetric wearing points fixed in holders in accordance with the invention; and Figure 4 shows, on a larger scale, a partially exploded perspective drawing of the holder according to the invention, a portion of the left-hand plough share and a wearing point, In the figures, the reference numeral 11a indicates a plough share for a left-hand turning plough body (not shown) and, correspondingly, a right-hand plough share lib for a right-hand turning plough body (not shown). Plough bodies of this kind that are used on the same plough (not shown), that is to say on a reversible plough, are substantially mirror-symmetric around a, in the operative position of the plough, vertical plane. In the drawings, the right-hand plough share lib is symmetric relative to the 5 left-hand plough share 11a. The plough share 11a, lib makes a horizontal cut in the soil as the plough is working. The plough share 11a, lib shown is provided with a vertical share wing 12 making a vertical cut upwards towards the surface of the soil that is being worked with the plough. In figure 1, the left-hand plough share is shown with a reversible wearing ΐο point 4 attached. The plough share 11a, lib is provided with a first attachment hole 111a and a second attachment hole 111b, 111b' respectively, for the attachment of the wearing point 4. Owing to the design of the share 11a, lib, the wearing point 4 is deflected sideways so that a rear wearing-point portion 41 clears the share wing 12. The attachment holes 111a and, respectively, 111b and 111b', and the bolt holes 43 ΐ5 of the reversible wearing point 4 lie staggered on respective sides of the longitudinal axis 42 of the wearing point 4. For the right-hand plough share lib, a wearing point 4 that is laterally inverted in relation to what is shown in figure 1 is used. Reference is now made to figures 3a, 3b and 4, in which the plough share 11a, lib is provided with a holder 2 for securing a wearing point 3 of the type that can be at- 2ο tached to the holder 2 by means of a connection socket 31 and a complementary connection pin 21. In the embodiment shown, the connection socket 31 is arranged on the wearing point 3. The connection pin 21 and the connection socket 31 are provided with guide elements 211 and 311, respectively, arranged for the wearing point 3 and the holder 2 to be joined together in a sliding manner. In that connection, reference is 25 made to the applicant's own patent ΕΡ 1259105. The holder 2 is provided with a first bolt hole 221 whose centre axis crosses the longitudinal axis 23 of the holder 2. At a distance from the first bolt hole 221 and spaced apart, mirror-symmetrically around the longitudinal axis 23 of the holder 2, two second bolt holes 222, 222' are arranged. The first bolt hole 221 and one of the second 3ο bolt holes 222 form a first bolt-hole group 22, whereas the first bolt hole 221 and the other one of the second bolt holes 222' form a second bolt-hole group 22'. When the holder 2 is attached to the left-hand plough share 11a, the first bolt-hole group 22 corresponding to the attachment holes 111a, 111b is used, whereas when the holder 2 is attached to the right-hand plough share lib, the second bolt-hole group 22' corre-35 sponding to the attachment holes 111a, 111b' is used. In the embodiment shown, the right-hand plough share lib is laterally inverted relative to the left-hand plough share 11a. However, the invention is not limited to this situation, but may also be adapted for a situation in which the attachment-hole pattern of the right-hand plough share lib is not a reflected image of the attachment-hole pattern of the left-hand plough share 11a. The invention also includes embodiments in which the bolt-hole groups 22, 22' include first boreholes 221 that do not coincide. The working direction of the plough is indicated by the arrow WD. 1.
