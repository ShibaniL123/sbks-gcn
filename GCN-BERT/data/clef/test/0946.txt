FEATURE TABLE # Feature # Feature 10 Candle warming image display 20 Image display lamp lamp apparatus 22 Base assembly 23 Base 24 Light bulb socket 25 Light bulb 26 Electrical cord 27 Electrical switch 28 Inner wall 30 Outer wall 40 Display image 50 Candle assembly 52 Container 54 Container upper opening 55 Container funnel 56 Container feet 58 Wax Referring now to the drawings, in a preferred embodiment the invention is a candle warming image display lamp apparatus 10 (CWIDL 10) for use in displaying user selectable images while providing light such as to light a room brightly or as a night light, while also warming a preferably wickless candle, without spilling molten candle wax comprising an image display lamp 20 and a candle assembly 50 removably mountable to the top of image display lamp 20. Image display lamp 20 further comprises a base assembly 22, an outer wall 30, and at least one display image 40. Base assembly 22 further comprises a base 23, a light bulb socket 24 (not shown) connected to base 23, a light bulb 25 electrically connected to light bulb socket 24, an electrical cord 26 electrically connected to light bulb socket 24, an electrical switch 27 electrically connected to electrical cord 26, and a preferably translucent inner wall 28 mounted to base 23. Image display lamp 20 further includes a preferably translucent outer wall 30 and at least one display image preferably defining an image printed on a paper or like substrate. Outer wall 30 is adapted to be slidingly positioned over inner wall 28 such that with the display image 40 may be displayably positioned in a gap formed between inner wall 28 and outer wall 30. Outer wall 30 preferably includes a flange on the top thereof that covers the gap formed between inner wall 28 and outer wall 30. It is noted that in an alternate embodiment, the image display lamp 20 may be powered by batteries or by a USB port mounted to base 23 or by batteries that are positioned within base 23 and recharged via a USB port that is mounted to base 23. Further, base 23 or other members of image display lamp 20 or candle assembly 50 may be made of glowing-in-the-dark or phosphorescent plastic. Candle assembly 50 further preferably defines a scented wickless candle assembly having a container 52 preferably defining generally translucent cubic shaped container having an upper opening 54 and a funnel 55 connected to upper opening 54 and extending inwardly into the inner cavity of container 52. Container 52 may include a plurality of feet 56 connect to an underside thereof. Container 52 may be a single integral structure or may be an assembly of structures such as a two piece container of a lower cup and an upper lid having a funnel such that the cup and lid fit together in a snap-tight configuration. Container 52 further includes a predetermined quantity of scented and preferably colored wax 58 cast into container 52. Container 52 may also optionally have a receiving flange to snappingly receive a snap-on cover for use when candle assembly 50 is not being heated or otherwise not in use such that scent of wax 58 is substantially contained within container 52 and such that wax 58 does not evaporate from candle assembly 50. Candle assembly 50 is adapted such that when wax 58 of candle assembly 50 is melted, because of inwardly extending funnel 55, wax 58 will not run out of container 52 regardless of the orientation in which the candle assembly 50 may be positioned. Candle assembly 50 is preferably adapted such that multiple instances of candle assembly 50 may be nestably stacked upon each other. It is noted that in an alternate embodiment, candle assembly 50 may have include wick. In practice, with display image 40 positioned in image display lamp 20, image display lamp 20 electrically powered, and candle assembly 50 mounted upon display lamp 20, CWIDL 10 provides light while displaying a selected display image 40 and while spill resistantly warming candle assembly 50 without the use of a flame so as to cause the aroma of candle assembly 50 to waft from candle assembly 50 via container opening 54. CWIDL 10 may be adapted such that there is some gap between display lamp 20 and candle assembly 50 to allow for ventilation or air to pass therebetween. If the user desires to change display image 40, the user may merely remove candle assembly 50 from the display lamp 20, slide outer wall 30 off of inner wall 28, exchange display image 40 with a different image, replace outer wall 30, and replace candle assembly 50. If the user tires of the scent or color of candle assembly 50, or when wax 58 of candle assembly 50 is consumed, the user merely substitutes one instance of candle assembly 50 with another instance of candle assembly 50. Candle assembly 50 is preferably a disposable candle (i.e. candle assembly 50 is discarded after consumption of wax 58 of candle assembly 50), but may alternately be a serviceable candle (i.e. candle assembly 50 may be recycled by adding wax 58 to container 52 to replace consumed wax 58 or by adding additional fragrance to existing wax 58 to replace dispersed fragrance). It is further noted that the CWIDL 10 may optionally have a battery powered fan mounted thereon to aid in the dispersal of the scent of the candle. In a first alternate embodiment, the invention is substantially identical to CWIDL 10 except that rather than using a light bulb to melt wax, the invention includes a heating element—such as those found in coffee cup warmers or wax warmers—to melt wax 58. In a second alternate embodiment, the invention forms a fondue warming apparatus which is substantially identical to CWIDL 10 except that in the alternate embodiment, wax 58 of candle assembly 50 is replaced with chocolate, caramel, fudge, marsh mellows, or like edible composition having a relatively low melt temperature such that strawberries, pineapple fruit, marshmallows, and like edible snacks may be dipped into the melted composition and consumed as a fondue style treat. The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics. The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects only as illustrative and not restrictive.
