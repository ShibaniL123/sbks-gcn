To a stirred solution of 2-t-butyldimethylsilyl-7-acetoxy-3-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)-6-methoxybenzofuran (120 mg, 0.44 mmol) in 1,2-dichloroethane (1 mL) at room temperature under nitrogen was added bromine (12 Î¼l, 0.44 mmol) dropwise and the reaction mixture was stirred at this temperature for 10 minutes. After this time the reaction was quenched with saturated sodium thiosulfate solution, extracted with ethyl acetate (20 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvent removed by distillation under vacuum. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluent=Hexane:diethyl ether; 8:2-7:3) to afford the title compound as a colourless crystalline solid (91 mg, 81%);
