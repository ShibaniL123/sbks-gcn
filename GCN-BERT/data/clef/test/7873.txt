The present invention relates to travelling conveyors and specifically to conveyors in which the several brackets supporting the articles being conveyed are lined together by short lengths of cable, the ends of which are fixed to the brackets. Among the objects of the invention is the improvement of several o£ the elements of said conveyors to provide for conveying a greater load than is now possible. Anther object is to provide means by which change of direction in either a vertical or horizontal plane may be accomplished with a shorter radius of the curve than is possible with conveyors of known construction. Still other objects and advantages will readily occur to those skilled in the art upon reference to the following description and the accompanying drawings in which Fig. I is a sectional view through one of the cable end buttons and its socket in a bracket, the section being taken on line 1--1 of Fig. 3.

Fig. 14 is a plan view of a portion of the track of the "dip". H The Conveyor represented in the drawings consists broadly of a plurality of load supporting brackets, such as shown in Figs. and 4, supported upon wheels travelling upon the lower flanges of an I-beam track. The brackets are equally spaced and connected by relatively short lengths of cable having at each end a button fitting into a socket in the bracket. The linked brackets forming a closed loop are driven along the track by means of one or more driving wheels such as that of Figs. 7 to lO. • L• .• . • • • ï ï i H l0 Referring now to Fig. i of the drawings, this shows in section one of the buttons at a cable link and, and shows it to be a sleeve 20 surrounding the cable 20A and with an annular wedge 20B inserted in the end of the cable between the core 20C and the cover strands 20D. In preparing the button, the sleeve 20 is first placed over the cable, the wedge inserted, and the whole subjected to a swaging or coining operation to produce interpenetration of the metal of the sleeve and outer surface o£ the cable and between the metal of the wedge and that of both the core and the outer strands of the cable. In order to permit insertion of the wedge 20B, the sleeve 20 is reamed as shown at 20E. The button Just described is cylindrical and lits snugly within a cylindrical socket as shown« An alterne ive form o£ button and socket is shown in Fig. 2 at the right. In this form, the outer sleeve 21 is shown as provided with a hemispherical portion 2lA with the test o£ the sleeve tapered as at 2lB. This form of button is seated in a socket having a correspondingly shaped seat for the hemispherical end of the button and the tapered portion permits the button to swing, thus reducing the binding of the cable of the cable on changes of direction of conveyor travel. The short lengths o£ a le thus provided with the buttons connect the load carrying brackets which are preferably o£ the form shown in Figs. 3 and 4. These, as shown, consist of a body portion 28 of two !! i i il ï ii k¸ I !i' l0 identical members face to face each having formed in its face one half of a cylindrical recess 25A serving as the socket for the buttons 20 or 21 on the cable links 20A. These sockets are accurately machined to provide a close fit for the buttons and are provided with a dividing ring or flange 25B as shown in Fig. l. Above and below the recessed portion the body is flanged for convenience in bolting thereto, the trolley arms 27 and load securing plates 26. The trolley arms 27 may be identical and are so formed as to form a fork embracing the lower double flange 30A of the track 30, and carry at their upper ends trolley wheels 31 and 32 arranged to roll upon the flange. The trolley wheels 31 and 32 shown are of somewhat different structure, the wheel 31 comprising a rim portion having a recess for the reception of a split outer race 3lA of a ball bearing, the inner race 3lB As fixed to the arm 27 by means of a suitable screw 31ff. The split race 3lA is held in place and together by means of a plat 31D in turn held in place by spinning over its edge a llp 3lE on the rim element. Plate 31D also carries a felt washer 5IF serving to keep out dirt. The wheel 52 consists of a rim member having a wide inwardly projecting flange portion 32A in which is mounted a plain bearing sleeve 32B, preferably of oil impregnated porous bearing metal. This sleeve cooperates with an inner member 32C having on one end an integral flange 32D of sufficient width to extend over the sleeve 32B and a portion of rim flange 32A. Member 32C is fixed to the arm 27 by means of a suitable screw 32E. lO In order to seal the other end of the bearing õ2B-32C, a plate 33 is inserted between the eye of the arm 27 and the inner member õ2C. This plate õ8 is shown in Fig. 5 as provided with madlally extending cleats 55A adapted to cooperate with radial grooves õõB formed in member õ2C and in the inner face of t he eye of arm 2V (see Fig. ô), thus locking the member õ2C against rotation. The trolley brackets are moved along the track by means of suitable motor means (not shown) acting upon a drive wheel õ5 such as is shown in Figs. V to 10. This wheel consists of a hub õSA having welded thereto tubular spokes õ5B each of which carries fixed to its outer end a stírrup 35C of rectangular conformation and of such dimension as to embrace the body portion 25 of one of the trolley brackets in alignment with the cables 20A. Each stirrup is notched as shown at õSD to receive the cable. Between the stirrup õ5C the wheel rim is completed by short arcuate members õSE having a V-shaped section to receive the intermediate cable porti0nso Among the advantages of such cable linked conveyors is their flexibility and thereby their capability of turning on a comparatively short radius. Advantage of this is taken in the "dip" construction shown in Figs. ll to 14, in which the I-beam track ; is bent down and up to provide, for example, for dipping conveyed articles into treating tanks. In Figs. ll to 14, the track õ0 is shown as bent down and up to provide a wide U, and at the lower part of the bend, the lower flanges õ0A and the web removed, leaving only the upper flanges lõ0A spaced apart as shown in Fig. 14. B05671 lO In the U-bend is fixed the frame work serving to support the track 30 and also to support an idling wheel 41 which consists of a disc having notches 4lA in its perimeter and V-shaped rim sections 4lB between the notches which are spaced to register with the brackets. This disc wheel lies between the upper flanges 130A of the track and, in order to permit free rotation of the wheel with its rim portions, suitable notches 130B are provided in the flanges. As the conveyor moves toward and into the dip, the wheel 41 will be between the two trolley arms and a notch 4lA will embrace the body portion of a bracket transferring the load from the lower track flanges 30A to the cable links themselves while the trolley wheels, travelling then on the upper flanges 130A help maintain the proper position of the brackets. Suitable braces 40B are used te support the flange portions 130A from the framework Z¸ !! i i ii• • ••• ..... • i ïi•i •i••.• .... • • LIj••• ï Ii•L •I•• t• •• • • . 605671 The embodiments of the invention in which an exclusive property or privilege is claimed are defined as follows: l.
