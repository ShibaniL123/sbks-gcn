Dental scanner device to be applied in general both in the field of stomatology, and dental prosthetics manufacturing. More specifically, it is an intraoral dental scanner for 3D teeth and gingivae imaging through a corresponding visualizing device. No manual manipulation whatsoever by an operator is necessary, as it is fully automated; it is introduced in the patient's oral cavity; the patient holds it by exerting pressure when biting it; therefore, the patient himself is the scanning fixed-reference system. Teeth and gingivae 3D diagnostic and therapeutic images have been traditionally obtained by using replicas or models from alginate-impressed molds. Such replicas get gingiva and tooth negative images, which are later on converted into positive, and then scanned. However, these mainstream techniques pose a double problem: the patient is uncomfortable; and they are not very reliable and accurate; thus, the process is slow and costly. There are several state-of-the-art devices that try to solve the problems posed by mainstream techniques; e.g.: panoramic dental X rays or computerized dental tomographies: EP 0825837, "Modular intra-oral imaging system video camera", for instance, mainly provides a 1-hand-held video camera to take images of the patient's inner part of the mouth. The camera has a socket; in the inner part of the socket there is a base, and a visualizing device, as well as a socket's long axis optically aligned sensor that converts into data the images taken by the camera.US 2006154198 3D dental scanner is both an imaging method and a system to get images of the dental structure in the inner part of the oral cavity, through the motion of at least one image capturer set on an fixed-reference-system coupled arm, external to the mouth, to generate a 3D model of the structure, based on the images captured.ES2 383 220, "Intraoral dental imaging sensor and X-ray system, using such sensor" is an intraoral dental radiological system equipped with a mouth-insertable X-ray imaging sensor. It is made up of an image-detection matrix to provide electronic signals. The system comprises a light source to receive the matrix-generated signals; it emits binary light impulses corresponding to a digital image to be transmitted; it also has a light receiver placed at a certain distance from the patient; it can detect a light modulation triggered by the light source; it can transmit to the image-treating device the signal corresponding to such modulation. Lastly, ES2324658 (T3), "Laser-digitalizing system for dental applications" is a laser digitilizer that has a light source with collimation optics to generate a collimated light beam; a scanner optically coupled with the light source (configured to scan the collimated beam towards the object to be optically represented in a predetermined pattern); an imaging instrument with an optical axis in a Î¸ angle with the scanner; this is set up to detect a pattern reflection from the object, and generate the object surface representative data, based on the pattern reflection; and a scanner-coupled processor, and [Sic.] the imaging system, configured to render a data-based 3D image of the object; it is characterized by the fact that the scanner is set up to scan the collimated beam all along at least to axes in the predetermined pattern. Such pattern encompasses a series of curvilinear segments. These state-of-the-art devices and systems have several inconveniences. First, in some cases, a technician must manually operate them with a toothbrush-like motion, which, obviously, is inaccurate. Likewise, they are based on photographs taken by the various devices; usually, a software interprets and interpolates such photographs to take a final 3D image. Thus, besides the time needed to get the final image, these known systems depend on the operator's skill for manipulating the camera and inserting it in not-easy-to-reach parts of the mouth. Other known devices do not depend so much on manual operation, but have an external fixed-coordinate system, independent of the patient; therefore, the final image is exclusively based on the images captured with no extra projection; thus, they are not very accurate, as the reference system changes with the slightest movement of the patient. This invention is a dental scanning device without any of the flaws of the previously known state-of-the-art systems; it captures 3D images with respect to a fixed-reference system; i.e.: the patient's mouth; thus, images are accurate, as the device moves along with the patient; i.e.; teeth-position point of reference, for instance, as related to the device, is preserved at all moments, and remains in place while scanning. To do so, this dental scanning device is made up of two embodiments; one of them lodges the scanner as such, as well as a mobile head probe; the other one is to be held when the patient bites, and is to correspondingly house the mobile head probe. Once the head probe part is introduced in the bite fixture - and therefore is held by the patient's mouth-the head probe sweeps in at least two directions. One, following the long axis of the head probe; and the other one, perpendicular to it, in both senses of the same direction, so that scanning is the result of a combination of both movements: lateral and deep, as related to the dental arcade. This is why the embodiment to be held by the patient's mouth is made of an easy-to-disinfect / sterilize material. Optionally, the aforementioned embodiments can be coupled to one another, and may be disassembled and joined again; in this case, either the patient's mouth-held piece is made of an easy-to-disinfect / sterilize material, or is disposed after use. In this case, the scanning embodiment (1) and the bite fixture (2) area easily coupled to one another through specially placed devices in the coupling ends. Below there is a description of the invention, based on one of the versions of choice, and as per attached drawings: Figure 1: Scanner device as per one version of the invention, as seen from above.Figure 2: Side view of the scanner device in figure 1, showing how it is placed in the patient's mouth.Figure 3: Schematization of figure 1, showing device scanning directions. As shown in figure 1, the dental scanner is made up of two embodiments. The first one, the scanning embodiment, lodges a mobile scan head probe (3) on a mobile long element at the end of which is the scan head probe (4) as such. This mobile element (3, 4) is partially kept inside the scanner embodiment (1). On the other hand, the scanner head probe (4) juts out the embodiment (1) and is lodged in the second embodiment or bite fixture (2) by way of a pocket. Thus, the bite fixture (2) is, therefore, a scanner head probe lodging pocket (4). In case the abovementioned bodies can be coupled, and separated and coupled again, the above is equally applied, just as when both embodiments (1 & 2) have been previously coupled to one another. As indicated, the bite fixture (2) is introduced in the patient's mouth; and it is held in place when the patient bites it, so that the scanner head probe (4) is introduced in the mouth to scan the corresponding dental arcade. Likewise, the bite fixture (2) is mouth shaped to make it easier to hold. Such bite fixture (2) is basically a protective pocket for the scanner head probe (4), and can be bitten by the user. This is why the bite fixture (2) is made of a suitable transparent material. Once the part of the scanner head probe (4) that is housed in the bite fixture (2) is introduced (reason for which it is secured in the patient's mouth), as shown in figure 2., the scanner head probe sweeps all along in at least two directions; one following the long axis of the long element (3), while the other one goes perpendicular to it in both directional senses, in such a way that scanning is the result of combining both side and deep motions with regard the dental arcade, as shown in figure 3. For the intraoral scanning, the device includes detection sensors, laser sensors or similar devices in the scanner head probe (4), as well as cameras to capture tooth-by-tooth sweep images from the dental arcade and gingivae. These are automatically generated and exact 3D images, as a result of their fixed and constant reference system. Dental scanner device characterized by the way it is made up of to embodiments; the first one, the scanner embodiment (1), houses a mobile head probe (3), is a long, mobile element ending in the scanner head probe (4) as such; the second embodiment, the bite fixture (2), is a scanner head probe housing pocket (4), and the element to be placed and held by the patient when biting it.
