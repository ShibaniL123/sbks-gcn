Α CELL EXPRESSION SYSTEM TECHNICAL FIELD [0001] The present invention relates to expression systems, in particular the invention relates to expression systems for the production of biological therapeutics. BACKGROUND [0002] Expression systems for the production of biological therapeutics or biopharmaceuticals, such as recombinant proteins, generally consist of a nucleic acid vector construct encoding the desired recombinant therapeutic and a chosen host cell. The vector is introduced into the host cell and the endogenous cell machinery is utilised for the production of the desired therapeutic i.e. the desired recombinant protein. The intricacies in establishing an efficient and reliable expression system for the production of approvable biological therapeutics are manifold. However, wellestablished expression systems may provide cost-effective alternatives for the production of pharmaceutical products otherwise difficult to obtain. [0003] Efficiency of the system itself depends on a large variety of factors including the design of the vector and the choice of host cell. The strategic combination of regulatory elements, selection markers and stability elements within the vector sequence have to balance simple manipulation and application of the vector with high yield production of the desired biological therapeutic. Determining a cell’s suitability to act as host cell in such an expression system is primarily governed by the need to maximise compatibility between the endogenous cell machinery and the regulatory elements present in the vector, while keeping potential adventitious contaminants in the final product minimal. Further, availability, cost and acceptability for regulatory approval of any therapeutic produced by the system, have to be considered. [0004] Nucleic acid vectors used in expression systems comprise plasmids, cosmids, Yeast Artificial Chromosomes (YACs), Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes (BACs), retroviral, adenoviral and lentiviral vectors. These vectors differ in many characteristics, such as their capacity to accommodate different sized nucleic acid inserts, their most efficient introduction method into the host cell and specifically in their utilisation of the endogenous cell machineries of different types of host cells to ensure sufficient expression of the desired protein. [0005] Regulatory elements commonly present in such expression vectors influence transcription, translation as well as protein synthesis of selection markers and of sequences encoding the desired biological therapeutic. Such regulatory elements include, but are not limited to, promoters, terminators, modifiers, insulators, spacers, regulatory protein binding sites, introns, inducers, etc. [0006] Known promoters include constitutively active promoters such as the thymidine kinase (ΤΚ) promoter, the actin promoter, the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) promoter, the simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40) early promoter, the cyclin Τ1 promoter, the RNA polymerase Π1U3 promoter, the cyclophillin promoter, the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter, the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV) Ρ10 promoter and the β3-galactosyltransferase 5 (P3GAL-T5) promoter. [0007] Known promoters also include inducible promoters such as the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) promoter (stress induced), the heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) promoter (stress induced), the alcoholdehydrogenase I (alcA) promoter (alcohol induced), the activating copper-metallothionein expression (ACE1) promoter (metal induced), the small subunit of ribulose-l,5-bisphophate-carboxylase (SSU1) promoter (light induced), the hypoxia induced factor 1α (hifla) promoter (hypoxia induced), the inducer of meiosis 2 (IME2) promoter (starvation induced), the glucocorticoid receptor (hormone induced), the estrogen receptor (hormone induced) and the ecdysone receptor (hormone induced). [0008] Further, cell type/tissue specific promoters, such as the nkx2.5 promoter (heart cells), the islet 1 promoter (pancreatic cells), the MyoD promoter (muscle cells), the cluster of differentiation 2 (CD2) promoter (T-cells) and the collagen II promoter (cartilage), are known to change their level of activity in response to cell type specific stimuli or to progression through developmental stages. [0009] Known terminator elements, such as the RNA Polymerase II terminator, the small nucleolar RNA 13 (snR13) terminator, the bovine growth hormone (BGH) terminator, the simian vims 40 (SV 40) terminator and the thymidine kinase (ΤΚ) terminator, may provide suitable polyadenylation signals. [0010] Known modifier and insulator elements include the tetracycline operator/receptor (tetO/tetR) system, the upstream activating sequence of the galactose dependent GAL4 transcription factor (GAL4 UAS), the adenovims early region Β1 TATA box, binding sites for the herpes simplex virus (HSV) regulatory protein VP 16, the 5’HS4 chicken β^ΕΛΐη insulator, the paternally expressed gene 3 (Peg3) insulator and the sea urchin arylsulfatase (ARS) gene insulator. [0011] While many attempts have been made to establish efficient and reliable expression systems for the production of approvable biological therapeutics, problems relating to low yield and adventitious contamination of the produced biopharmaceuticals remain. Choosing the most effective combination of suitable regulatory elements from the plethora of options, such that the system conveys stability and the highest degree of compatibility with the endogenous host cell machinery, poses a major challenge in the field. [0012] Obtaining regulatory approval for a biopharmaceutical product poses a further challenge. Regulatory approval involves determination of the safety and efficacy of the pharmaceutical product prior to marketing. The process of gaining regulatory approval for innovator drugs is very time consuming and expensive. However, once approved, these drugs may be very profitable, particularly when they are marketed under exclusivity rights such as patent protection. [0013] The profitability of innovator drug’s market may provide a substantial incentive to exploit this market once patent rights have expired. Following patent expiry, innovator drugs can be marketed as generic drugs or biosimilars for drugs produced by recombinant DNA technology. Generic versions of blockbuster biopharmaceuticals near patent expiry include Epogen (erythropoietin, ΕΡΟ) and Neupogen (granulocyte colony stimulating factor, G-CSF). The approval of a follow-on version of Pfizer’s Genotropin (recombinant human growth hormone) seems to indicate a change in a landscape where previously, biopharmaceuticals enjoyed immunity from competition even after expiration of their patent protection. At present, there are over 80 generic versions of biopharmaceuticals in development (Datamonitor 2010). [0014] Biosimilars ideally are bioequivalents of the innovator drugs and, as such, the path to regulatory approval for biosimilars is in theory less arduous than for the original innovator drug as the clinical data establishing safety and efficacy have been carried out. [0015] Approval of generic biopharmaceuticals is dependent on comparable dosage form, strength, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use compared with approved biopharmaceuticals (that is, the reference listed drugs). For example, under the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), approval for a generic drug involves an “Abbreviated New Drug Application” (ANDA) which generally does not include pre-clinical and clinical data to establish safety and effectiveness. Approval also involves a bioequivalence review, which establishes that the proposed generic drug is bioequivalent to the reference-listed drug. This bioequivalency is based upon a demonstration that the rate and extent of absorption of the active ingredient in the generic drug fall within the scope of the parameter of the reference listed drug. [0016] Importantly, there is a chemistry/microbiology review process that provides an assurance that the generic drug will be manufactured in a reproducible manner under controlled conditions to ensure that the drug will perform in a safe and acceptable manner. [0017] Although guidelines for the approval of biosimilar drugs exist, there is uncertainty in regard to the practicalities of regulatory approval of biosimilars. Much of the uncertainty is driven by the lack of a clear practical and detailed regulatory pathway for the approval of such dmgs and the scientific debate over product comparability and interchangeability. The uncertainties resulting from the manufacture of biosimilar dmgs under conditions different than those used by the innovator suggest that it may be impossible to develop a tme “generic” version of a biotechnology drug. Indeed, regulatory authorities in Europe and the US have shunned the use of the term “biogeneric”, preferring the nomenclature “biosimilar” and “follow-on biologicals”. [0018] Many quality concerns for expression system-derived biopharmaceuticals have originated from the presence of adventitious contaminants or from the properties of the host cells used to prepare the product. Several of these products have also had quality concerns regarding the expression vector of the system. It is well established that cell properties and events linked to cell culture can affect resultant product quality and safety. Effective quality control of recombinant products requires appropriate controls on all aspects of handling the cell and cell culture. This is particularly relevant to the development of biosimilars. [0019] Previously, Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells were modified and engineered to produce insulin. However these CHO cells were unable to express biological active insulin and thus the patents associated with this type or method of CHO cell modification were not commercial exploited. Fully functional insulin was not produced in CHO cells due to cryptic splicing of the insulin gene message by the translational machinery In the CHO cell. [0020] Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be considered as an admission that such prior art is widely known or forms part of common general knowledge in the field. [0021] It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0066] Preferred embodiments of the invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings and non-limiting examples. [0067] It has been found that events during the culture of a cell may contribute significantly to the assessment of the risks associated with the use of that particular cell for production of proteins and more particularly proteins for therapeutic use. [0068] Diligent records of all manipulations including the history of a cell throughout development, extending to the parental cell line from which it was derived, may contribute to the quality and safety of the final product. [0069] In one scenario, such information may be important for gaining regulatory approval of protein therapeutics expressed from a cell. In particular, biosimilars present unique issues. These issues include demonstrating that immunogenicity of the biosimilar has not been altered with respect to the reference listed drug, as well as ensuring that there are no undetected differences in the product that may potentially impact the safety and efficacy of the drug. Resolving such issues would be problematic without conducting extensive clinical trials. As such, it is likely that any application for a biosimilar would be required to demonstrate that there are no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity and potency between the biosimilar and the reference listed drug. Moreover, an application for a biosimilar would need to provide evidence that the biosimilar has “profound similarity” (as it is impractical to demonstrate identical biological products) and that the biosimilar will produce the same clinical result as the reference listed drug in any given patient. [0070] In order to gain regulatory approval, traditional generic manufacturers are required to demonstrate their drug is chemically identical to the referenced listed drug and exhibit the same properties in the human body as the original drug. In regard to biosimilars, it was previously not possible to readily demonstrate that a second-source biologic drug is unequivocally identical to an innovator drug due to the complexities of the synthesis of the drugs in potentially disparate biological systems. As such, biosimilars may exhibit slightly different properties to the original drugs that may necessitate abbreviated clinical trials in order to gain regulatory approval. [0071] In the context of the present invention, the term “contaminating agent” refers to any agent that can potentially compromise regulatory approval of a product by a regulatory agency. Such agents may include but are not limited to adventitious agents such as viruses, bacteria, fungi and mycoplasma or proteins there from. [0072] As used herein the term “cell expressed product” refers to any product produced by the cell, including but not limited to proteins, peptides, glycoproteins, carbohydrates, lipids, glycolipids and nucleic acids. [0073] The term “regulatory approval” in so far as it relates to a product defined in the context of this specification, refers to approval from a regulatory authority which permits marketing of the product. [0074] The term “safety and effectiveness studies” refers to any studies conducted on a product that assess the safety and efficacy of that product for human and/or animal administration. [0075] The term “clinical trials” refers to studies involving either animal or humans designed assess the safety and/or efficacy of a product for a therapeutic application. [0076] The term “abbreviated safety effectiveness studies and/or abbreviated clinical trials” refers to studies carried out on a drug which does not involve complete phase I, II and III clinical trials. Such studies may include a bioequivalence review and a chemistry/microbiology review as defined by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). [0077] The term “biosimilar drug” and ‘biosimilar” refer to a bioequivalent pharmaceutical of a drug in which patent protection has expired and where the previously protected drug has regulatory approval. In particular, this includes products prepared in cell culture by recombinant DNA technology. The term “biosimilar drug” and ‘biosimilar” as used herein is equivalent to the terms “follow-on biologicals” or “biosimilars”. [0078] The term “protein” refers to a "complete" protein as well as fragments, derivatives or homologs or chimeras thereof comprising one or more amino acid additions, deletions or substitutions, but which substantially retain the biological activity of the complete protein. [0079] The embodiments of the present invention will now be described by reference to the following non-limiting examples. [0080] Example 1 [0081] Construction of pNeu and pNAS vectors for high level expression of recombinant therapeutic protein [0082] The vector pNeu was designed for high-level expression of single chain peptides for the production of therapeutic proteins. The vector facilitates the insertion DNA sequences into a convenient multiple cloning site for expression in CHO cells. See Table 1 and Figure 1A for a description of the vector and its component features. [0083] The 5026 bp vector encodes essential coding and regulatory sequences for the efficient expression of the recombinant gene as well as essential sequences for the selection and propagation of the plasmid in bacteria. It was designed for chemical synthesis and is void of nonessential and redundant sequences that are common components in commercial expression vectors. This allows for ease of genomic insertion with less likelihood of deletion of sequences during plasmid propagation resulting in loss of expression. The multiple cloning site encodes a minimum of two unique restriction sites for rapid gene cloning. [0084] Example 2 [0085] Synthesis and cloning of human growth hormone (hGH) cDNA into pNAS [0086] The amino acid sequence encoding for hGH was subjected to bioinformatic analysis through proprietary third party software by GENEART AG, Regensburg Germany. Codon options were utilized to maximize expression by improving mRNA maintenance and the exploitation of available tRNA pools in CHO cells. RNA and codon optimization was performed on the coding sequences. The gene was analysed with respect to splice site recognition, mRNA stability, presence of ribosomal entry sites, mRNA secondary structures, self-homology for the purpose of increasing gene expression in CHO cells. The hGH gene was cloned into pNAS using Agel and EcoRV restriction sites using methods well known in the art. [0087] Example 3 [0088] Construction of pNeuMAB vector for expression of recombinant monoclonal antibody [0089] The pNeuMAB vector was designed for the cloning and expression of recombinant monoclonal antibodies. The DNA encoding heavy and light chains are configured in the vector as two distinct and tandem transcription units. See Table 1 and Figure IB for a description of the vector and its component features. [0090] Synthesis of cDNA encoding heavy chain and light chain of an antibody infliximab [0091] The amino acid sequence encoding the heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) of the monoclonal antibody, Infliximab were subjected to bioinformatic analysis through proprietary third party software by GENEART AG, Regensburg Germany. Codon options were utilized to maximize expression by improving mRNA maintenance and the exploitation of available tRNA pools in CHO cells. RNA and codon optimization was performed on the coding sequences. The genes were analysed with respect to splice site recognition, mRNA stability, presence of ribosomal entry sites, mRNA secondary structures, self-homology for the purpose of increasing gene expression in CHO cells. [0092] Cloning gene encoding heavy chain of Infliximab [0093] The synthetic gene encoding for the heavy chain of Infliximab was assembled from synthetic oligonucleotides and/or PCR products. The fragment was cloned into pGA14 (ampR) using AscI and PacI restriction sites. The plasmid DNA was purified (Pure Yield™ Plasmid Midiprep, Promega) from transformed bacteria and concentration determined by UV spectroscopy. The final construct was verified by sequencing. The sequence congruence within the used restriction sites was 100%. The synthetic cDNA sequence encoding heavy chain of Infliximab was designed to incorporate unique restriction sites Age I and Eco RV at the 5’ and 3’ ends respectively for directional cloning into the first multiple cloning site of NeuClone’s antibody expression vector, pNeuMAB digested with the same restriction sites. [0094] Cloning gene encoding light chain of Infliximab [0095] The synthetic gene encoding the light chain of Infliximab was assembled from synthetic oligonucleotides and / or PCR products. The fragment was cloned into pGA18 (ampR) using AscI and PacI restriction sites. The plasmid DNA was purified (Pure Yield™ Plasmid Midiprep, Promega) from transformed bacteria and concentration determined by UV spectroscopy. The final construct was verified by sequencing. The sequence congruence within the used restriction sites was 100%. The synthetic cDNA sequence encoding light chain of Infliximab incorporates the unique restriction sites Sal I and Mlu I at the 5’ and 3’ ends respectively for directional cloning into the second multiple cloning site of NeuClone’s antibody expression vector, pNeuMAB digested with the same restriction sites. [0096] Generation of NeuCHO [0097] Transfection of DG44 Cells with pNAS-hGH [0098] One of the preferred methods by which the expression vector encoding human growth hormone into the host CHO DG44 cell line and the status of the rDNA within the host (copy number, etc.) is as follows. Briefly, a total of 1.5 χ 10℮7 cells were transfected with 1.8 ug of linearized plasmid DNA together with 15 ul of FreeStyle MAX Reagent (Invitrogen) in a volume of 30ml. The transfected cell cultures were incubated at 37 C, 8% C02 on an orbital shaker platform. At 48 hours post transfection the cells were cultured in hypoxanthne- and thymidine-deficient, medium supplemented with Gentamycin at a final concentration of 500ug/ml for selection of uptake of plasmid DNA. Clones were selected by limiting dilution cloning. Several single clones arising from a single cell were expanded and cell lines were characterised for production of human growth hormone. Resulting clones were examined for growth properties in comparison to the standard CHO DG44 cell line. [0099] Transfection of NeuCHO with pNeuMAB encoding Infliximab genes [00100] Linearized plasmid pNeuMAB DNA encoding Infliximab genes was used to transfect NeuCHO cell cultures At 48 hours post transfection the cells were cultured into hypoxanthne- and thymidine-deficient, medium to select for cells expressing the DHFR gene. A stable cell population was then subjected to subsequent stepwize increasing methotrexate (ΜΤΧ) concentration (50-, 100-, 200-, 400-, 800ηΜ, luM) in order to amplifiy template DNA copy number and gene expression. Clones were selected by limiting dilution cloning. Clones with high level expression of infliximab protein were scaled up for protein production.

[00112] More specifically, Figure 1Α depicts an expression vector pNAS including hGH coding sequence for use in constructing the NeuCHO Cell Line from CHO DG44. Preferably, NeuCHO cell line is produced by the inclusion of the vector shown in Figure 1Α within a CHO-DG44 cell line. The genetic sequence for this expression vector has been submitted along with this application and is designated SEQ. ID No. 1. [00113] It is noted that CHO DG44 cell line includes a relatively and fragile cell line which inherently has issues and problems in regard to long term viability, cell density and population stability. [00114] In this preferred embodiment, the addition of hGH to the cell culture vector may lead to increases in cell density or production that were previously not realisable using previous techniques and sequences. Previously, growth factors such as IGF-1 and insulin were used to supplement CHO cells (such as DG44). However these previous methods lead to disappointing results in terms of cell viability and/or survival. In the present embodiments, the addition of hGH coding sequences to CHO cells allows for the excretions by the CHO-DG44 cells of hGH. This expression and secretion of hGH into the cell media leads to increase in cell survival of CHO cells. [00115] Further the expression of hGH may also improve the robustness of the NeuCHO cell line as compared to other CHO cell lines. [00116] More specifically, the addition of hGH expressing sequences to CHO-DG44 cells gave rise to a new cell line, NeuCHO cell line. The NeuCHO cell line may include any of the expression vectors described and shown in respect to Figures 1 Α-Η. [00117] The NeuCho cell line, deposited under the provisions of the Budapest Treaty with the Cell Bank Australia located at 214 Hawkesbury Rd, Westmead, NSW, 2145, Australia as of 4 February 2013 and assigned accession no. CBA20130024, as is particularly suitable for use in pharmaceutical manufacture as described within the present application. [00118] Preferably, the CHO-DG44 cell line was transfected with the pNAS-hGH vector to produce the NeuCHO cell line. Possible transfection methods include: standard methods described in the scientific literature including: calcium phosphate precipitation, PEI, Electroporation and lipofaction. It is generally noted that previous teachings in the field have often argued that it is preferred to deliver higher relative levels of DNA to cells by transfection to get better results. However, transfection methods delivering more DNA into the cell do not generate more stable or high producing cell lines, as the cell lines may become less stable and less robust. [00119] Figure IB depicts an expression vector used for the expression of a single chain protein in CHO DG44 cells. Preferably, the recombinant gene expression may be driven by the SV40 early promoter/enhancer within the vector. The genetic sequence for this expression vector has been submitted along with this application and is designated SEQ. ID No. 2. [00120] Figure 1C depicts an expression vector used for the expression of a single chain protein in CHO DG44 cells. Preferably, a dicistronic expression cassette with a recombinant gene in the 1st cistron followed by a DHFR gene in the 2nd cistron is described in this example. The gene expression in this vector is preferably driven by SV40 early promoter or enhancer. The genetic sequence for this expression vector has been submitted along with this application and is designated SEQ. ID No. 3. [00121] Figure ID depicts a pNeuMAB, which is a dual expression vector containing two cloning cassettes to insert heavy and light chain genes into a single vector. This expression vector has two gene expression cassettes for the insertion of multiple recombinant genes. Each cassette includes an SV40 early promoter and downstream poly A sequence. Each gene is driven by driven SV40 promoter without an enhancer sequence. This expression vector is suitable for expression of light and heavy chains expression of the antibodies. The genetic sequence for this expression vector has been submitted along with this application and is designated SEQ. ID No. 4. [00122] Figure IE depicts a further expression vector, pNeuMAB-IRES-DHFR, for high level expression of heavy and light chains of a recombinant monoclonal antibody on a single vector driven one SV40 promoter and enhancer. This expression vector may be used for the expression of light and heavy antibody chains. This expression vector generally includes two gene expression cassettes for insertion of recombinant genes. Each cassette consists of SV40 early promoter/enhancer and downstream poly A sequence. Heavy chain and light chain are inserted in 1st and 2nd cassettes respectively. The 2nd cassette is dicistronic having light chain followed by DHFR downstream of IRES . The genetic sequence for this expression vector has been submitted along with this application and is designated SEQ. ID No. 5. [00123] Figure IF depicts a further expression vector, pNeuMAB-IRES-DHFR-(CMV), for high level expression of heavy and light chains of recombinant monoclonal antibody on a single vector driven by CMV and SV40 promoters of heavy and light chains of antibodies respectively. The DHFR gene is driven by IRES downstream of light gene; for the expression of heavy and light chains of antibody in opposite orientations with respect to each other. Heavy chain is driven by CMV promoter whereas light chain is driven by SV40 promoter/enhancer. Light chain and DHFR gene have a dicistronic configuration with DHFR downstream of IRES. The genetic sequence for this expression vector has been submitted along with this application and is designated SEQ. ID No. 6. [00124] Figure 1G depicts a further expression vector, pMAB-LC (ires-dhfr), for expression of only light chains (LC) of antibodies. A discistronic cassette for cloning LC in 1st cistron and DHFR in 2nd cassette downstream of IRES. The vector is used in co-transfection with ρΜΑΒ HC, which is the expression vector shown in Figure 1Η. The genetic sequence for this expression vector has been submitted along with this application and is designated SEQ. ID No. 7. [00125] Figure 1Η depicts a further expression vector, pMAB-HC, for expression of only heavy chain (HC) of antibodies. Both pMAB-LC and pMAb-HC are co-transfected for expression of complete antibody. The genetic sequence for this expression vector has been submitted along with this application and is designated SEQ. ID No. 8. [00126] A further graph is shown in Figure 2. The graph of Figure 2 represents the: Growth of DG44 Cell Lines expressing IGF-1 or hGH compared to the Parental DG44 Cell Line and a Mock Cell Line. A control (mock) cell line is derived from the Parental Cell Line which has been stably transfected with a DNA plasmid containing the selection marker but without the Gene Of Interest (GOI). [00127] The preferred NeuCHO Cell Line demonstrates superior growth advantage compared to the original Parental DG44 Cell Line. In this example, the growth of NeuCHO cells demonstrates higher viable cell densities to that of a DG44 Cell Line expressing the IGF-1 gene. [00128] This graph shows that when DG44 cells express human Growth Hormone, (Line Graphs Ε and F), the cells have a very high Maximum Viable Cell Density (up to 425%) compared to the untransfected DG44 Parental Cell Line, the Mock transfected Cell Line, and DG44 Cell Lines expressing high or Low IGF-1 protein. [00129] The NeuCHO Cell Line has an Integral Cell Density of up to 3.67 X 107cell/day/mL, which is 230% that of the Parental DG44 Cell Line, 1.57 X 107cell/day/mL. [00130] Also in Figure 2, the Viable Cell Density is plotted on the Y-axis in cells / mL, and the number of days in culture is plotted on the X-axis. Six line graphs are shown in the figure, namely line graph A, Β, C, D, Ε and F. [00131] Line A represents the growth pattern of a parental DG44 cell line that is not transfected with DNA. [00132] Line Β represents the growth pattern of a parental DG44 cell line that was transfected with a DNA plasmid containing the selection marker but without the Gene Of Interest (GOI). [00133] Line C represents the growth pattern of a parental DG44 cell line that was stably transfected with a DNA plasmid containing both the selection marker and the Gene Of Interest (GOI). The GOI here is Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). [00134] Line D represents the growth pattern of a parental DG44 cell line that was stably transfected with a DNA plasmid containing both the selection marker and the Gene Of Interest (GOI). The GOI here is Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). [00135] Line Ε represents the growth pattern of a parental DG44 cell line that was stably transfected with a DNA plasmid containing both the selection marker and the Gene Of Interest (GOI). The GOI here is human Growth Hormone (hGH). [00136] Line F represents the growth pattern of a parental DG44 cell line that was stably transfected with a DNA plasmid containing both the selection marker and the Gene Of Interest (GOI). The preferred GOI in this example is human Growth Hormone (hGH). [00137] In Figure 3, a further graph is depicted comparing the integral of viable cell densities (IVCD) of NeuCHO with the standard CHO DG44 cells. This figure demonstrates the difference in the Integral of Viable Cell Densities achieved with the parent cell line NeuCHO compared to parental CHO. [00138] The NeuCHO cell line is superior in growth capabilities and this translates into a more efficient production process which can minimize costs by having higher productions rates, fewer production runs, thus lower productions costs, lower Cost of Goods (COGS). [00139] Growth and productivity of NeuCHO cell line expressing a recombinant mAB. [00140] The preferred NeuCHO cell line demonstrates high titre of mAB χ compared to traditional CHO expression system. [00141] Figure 5 demonstrates in graphical form that NeuCHO cells may have greater stable transfection efficiency than CHO cells (such CHO DG44 cells). Cells (NeuCHO and CHO) were transfected with DNA encoding mAB ‘x ‘ prior to selection and single cell cloning from a stable pool. The data is shown in Figure 5 and demonstrates that stable transfection of NeuCHO cells results in a greater number of clones with high productivity than that of standard CHO cells. The graph shows the levels of various protein expressed in relative quantities at a given time. [00142] NeuCHO cells have an integral of viable cell density that is about 230% greater thanCHO DG44 cell lines. CHO DG44 cell lines expressing insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) do not demonstrate the ability to grow to high cell densities as NeuCHO cell lines may generally achieved. NeuCHO cells have a generally greater transfection efficiency than CHO DG44 cells. The survival rate of transfected NeuCHO cells is generally greater then transfected CHO DG44 cells. Additionally, transfection of NeuCHO cells may result in a greater number of clones with a higher productivity than that of standard CHO DG44 cells. [00143] Preferably, the expression system and vectors described herein may be able to allow or facilitate CHO cells such NeuCHO or CHO DG44 cells to produce desired proteins suitable for pharmaceutical preparation including, but not limited to: Infliximab tumour necrosis factor (referred to as Remicab™); Adalimumab tumour necrosis factor (referred to as Humira™); Etanercept tumour necrosis factor (referred to as Enbrel™); Rituximab CD20 (referred to as Rituxan™ & MabThera™); Bevacizumab vascular endothelial growth factor (referred to as Avastin™); Trastuzumab HER2 (referred to as Herceptin™); Ranibizumab vascular endothelial growth factor (referred to as Lucentis™); Cetuximab epidermal growth factor receptor (referred as Erbitux™); Erythropoietin α; Interferon α - Pegylated interferon alfa-2a; Interferon α - Pegylated interferon alfa-2b and hGH. [00144] NeuCHO cells when used as feeder layer may also increase efficiency of single cell cloning. NeuCHO cells were seeded in single wells of microtitre plates prior to single cell cloning of a stable transfected pool. Secretion of human growth hormone secreted from NeuCHO cells results in an increased survival rate of single cells following Limiting Dilution Cloning.
