FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to systems, treatment beds, apparatuses and methods for preventing pressure ulcers. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Pressure ulcers also known as bedsores or decubitus ulcers develop when a patient is forced to lie down or sit for a long period of time without being able to change position. Bedsores are known for being hard to treat and for causing excruciating pain and can cause ischemia, which can lead to tissue necrosis if left untreated. In some cases, if the ulcer extends to a large tissue surface necrosis may be unavoidable. Therefore, people who treat bedridden patients or patients who are required to sit for long periods are very aware of the danger of developing pressure ulcers and how important it is to try and prevent these ulcers from developing. There are some methods and systems that are currently used to try and prevent pressure ulcers from being developed such as specially designed foam, gel or air-filled cushions or mattresses that can relieve pressure and help ensure that the body is appropriately positioned in the bed/chair or systems that can lift or facilitate a caretaker in lifting the patient into a vertical posture. These methods and systems require caretakers such as the hospital/institute nurses to turn bedridden patients for changing their laying position, change their sheets frequently and lifting those patients to a vertical position. Patients who are bedridden for long periods often gain weight making these tasks even harder to perform and may require more caretakers. Moreover, these methods often cause embarrassment and frustration for the bedridden patients who utterly depend upon others. WO2011/098929 A1 (Velez et al) teaches a dynamic surface comprising a plurality of cranks assembled in an oscillatory geometric form, the rotation whereof generating an undulating movement. Furthermore there is simultaneously provided a mechanism of action of transfer of the patient having the objective of accomplishing more thorough treatment, consequently generating pressure varying over time on the skin of the patient without the latter being required to move unaided or with the assistance of third parties DE102005015305 A1 (Baumeister) teaches a mechanism having shafts (2) that are "propelled by at least one drive motor (3). Massage bodies (12) are eccentrically arranged along the longitudinal axis of each shaft. The shafts are arranged such that their longitudinal axes are parallel to each other.

The actuator is configured for moving the bearings back and forth through a predefined rotational span to allow moving the respective patient back and forth allowing thereby covering a maximal number of touch points per timeframe over a part of the patient's body that interfaces these bearings. The system may further comprise at least one motor for operating the actuator. The bearings are arranged in rows, in each such row the bearings are connected via an axis, each respective axis connects to a main connecting strap that is rotatable by the at least one actuator, wherein rotation of the connecting strap allows rotation of the bearings.

A system that does not form part of the invention includes an enveloping strip operatively associated with the actuator, where the enveloping strip covers the bearings in a manner that allows the enveloping strip to interface the respective patient laying thereover while the weight of the patient is applied upon at least some of the bearings through the enveloping strip. The enveloping strip optionally interfaces the bearings and is rotated by the at least one actuator to allow indirect rotation of the bearings. The system optionally further includes a movable plate which connects to a part of the enveloping strip, to a base supporting the system, where the actuator enables moving the plate from a first position to a second position, allowing thereby to move the patient's body from one position to another and thereby allowing the bearings to shift their touch points locations interfacing the patient's body. In some embodiments, the at least one actuator comprises a linear motor actuator and connects to an actuator piston for allowing lateral movement of the piston to laterally move said plate for rotating said enveloping strip.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION In the following detailed description of various embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part thereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. It is understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, provides systems and methods for preventing pressure ulcers for bedridden patients or any other patients that are forced to either lay or sit for long periods of time. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the systems and methods use rotatable bearings arranged over one or more bearings assemblies, where a patient is laid over the bearings in a manner that allows at least some of the bearings to apply pressure over body parts of the laid patient interfacing therewith and shift touch points over which the pressure is applied over time. The bearings are automatically rotatable and therefore significantly reduce the man power required to continuously move the bedridden patient to prevent him/her from developing pressure ulcers. This is carried out by using a system, which can be designed as a treatment bed, including a bearings assembly over which spherical or wheel like bearings are arranged, where the bearings either directly or indirectly interface the patient's body to move thereof. The rotation of the bearings interfacing the patient moves the body of the patient (who is often unable to move himself/herself) and thereby the touching/pressure points change location in respect to the patient's body over time, allowing preventing the patient's blood-flow from being interrupted, weakened and/or stopped, and thereby preventing pressure ulcers (also known as bedsores) from developing. The size and configuration of each of the bearings as well as their arrangement over the bearings assembly (e.g. in rows that interface one another) allow optimally shifting touch points between the bearings and the patient's body in a continuous manner, providing a system that can efficiently prevent pressure ulcers. The system simply moves the patient either continuously or at very short time-intervals from one position to another by rotating the bearings in a respective continuous or near-continuous manner to shifts the touch points, which are the locations upon which the pressure of the bearings is applied over the patient body part interfacing thereof. This allows pressuring one point at each given moment, while relieving an adjacent point, which was recently touched in a continuous or near-continuous manner. The term near-continuous indicates that the bearings are moved at predefined or controlled time intervals, where those time-intervals are short enough to allow efficiently preventing developing of pressure ulcers. These time-intervals are set according to a calculation that optimizes the efficiency of the system, where the calculation depends, inter alia, in the dimensions of a respective bearing and bearings assembly in respect to a target patient size and weight. For example, the optimal number and size of the bearings as well as the distance between each two adjacent bearings may be different for patients of certain weight and/or height ranges and/or age range than of a different one or more of these age/weight/height ranges. Reference is now made to Figures 1-2, schematically illustrating a system 100 for preventing pressure ulcers, that does not form part of the present invention. The system 100 includes: (i) a base 200 having base legs 210A and 210B; (ii) a bearings assembly 110 mounted on the base 200, where the bearings assembly includes a multiplicity of movable spherical bearings 20 arranged in rows, where each row of bearings 20 is pivotally held by a respective axel 25; (iii) an enveloping strip 120, enveloping the bearings assembly 110 through the base 200 in a manner that allows the upper part of the strip 120 to interface (touch) the bearings 20 when the patient is laid thereover; (iv) a linear actuator 60 enabling to rotate the enveloping strip 120 and thereby to rotate the spherical bearings 20 over their axels 25; and (v) a controller 70 which connects to the actuator 60 for operating and controlling thereof. The actuator 60 may include a linear motor actuator connected to a piston 61 that can push a movable plate 201 connected to the base 200 between two positions and/or between two limiting stoppers that define the back-and-forth span of the movement of the plate 201 for rotating the enveloping strip 120. The rotation of the enveloping strip 120 rotates the interfacing bearings 20 and thereby move the body of the patient laying thereover from position to position thereby enabling to shift the pressure applied upon each touch point over the patient body parts interfacing the upper surface of the strip 120.at each given moment (or time interval) the pressure of each given bearing 20 is applied upon a different spot (touch point) over the patient's interfacing body part (e.g. the patient's back). As illustrated in Fig. 1 the bearings assembly 110 includes two longitudinal frame bars 112a and 112b and two rotational bars 111a and 111b framing the longitudinal bars 112a and 112 b.Fig. 4A and 4B show how the enveloping strip 120 wraps the upper part of the bearings assembly 110 and connects to the plate 201. The enveloping strip 201 is a closed looped layer of a substantially elastic material such as fabric, polymeric elastic strip, and the like that can be rotated in one rotational direction v1 and the opposite one v2 for rotation the bearings 20 thereby in respective opposite rotational directions. This enables, as mentioned above, moving the patient's body from one position to another and thereby to shift touch/pressure points between the patient's body and the bearings 20 interfacing his/her body. The controller 70 may connect to a power supply e.g. by connecting to a main electricity line and/or by operating on its own chargeable generator/battery. As illustrated in Fig. 4B, for example, the controller may supply the power to the actuator 60. Alternatively, each may be connected to a power supply separately while connecting to one another to allow the controller 70 to control the actuator 60. It is further illustrated in Fig. 4B how the controller 70 and/or the actuator 60 can be operated from remote through the use of a remote controller 71 using any technique known in the art for allowing wired or wireless communication therebetween (e.g. infrared, radio frequency, etc.). Fig. 5A shows the base 200 part of the system 100 showing how the plate 201 connects to the piston 61 of the linear motor actuator 60 through bar 202 that allows pushing the plate 201 back and forth from a first position shown in Fig. 5A to a second position shown in Fig. 5B. The span of the plate 201 movement is defined by the distance between two or more limiting edge stoppers such as stoppers 231a , 231b, 232a and 232b. The actuator 60 and therefore the piston 61 are controlled by the controller 70, which can be set to a single operation allowing only on/off operations by a user of the system 100 such as a caretaker of the patient. In this case the rotation may be substantially continuous shifting the piston's 61 pushing/pulling direction upon reaching the stoppers 231a , 231b, 232a and 232b) of motion and thereby enabling to rotate the enveloping strip 120 to one direction through a first time interval "Δt1" for rotating the bearings 20 in a first rotation direction throughout that time interval "Δt1" and to another strip 120 and therefore bearings 20 rotational direction throughout another time interval "Δt2". A pause of "Δt3" may be necessary for mechanically switching from one direction to another. As illustrated in Figures 5A and 5B, the stoppers 231a 2. , 231b, 232a and 232b are located over holding bars 230a and 230b enabling to place the movable plate 201 thereover and holding thereof. The plate 201 may simply be moved over these bars 230a and 230b or slide therethrough via slidable members (Not shown) to reduce the friction therebetween. Fig. 6A shows an elevated view of the base 200 and plate 201 in a first rotation position/limit and indicates the location of crossing A-A of the cross sectional view of Fig. 6B. Fig. 6B shows the plate 201 in the first position, in which it reached the limit of the stoppers 232a and 232b. The enveloping strip 120 is arranged under the rotatable bars 111a and 111b for allowing rotation thereof. In the first position of the plate 201 the piston 61 is at its maximal pull position. Correspondently, Fig. 7A shows an elevated view of the base 200 and plate 201 in a second rotation position/limit and indicates the location of crossing B-B of the cross sectional view of Fig. 7B. Fig. 7B shows the plate 201 in the second position, in which it reached the limit of the stoppers 231a and 231b. In the second position of the plate 201 the piston 61 is at its maximal push position The strip 120 rotates the spherical bearings 20 over their axels 25 to allow shifting their touch points locations in respect to the patient's body.to efficiently do so, the bearings 20 rows may be arranged in a substantially dense arrangement, in which, as shown in Figures 2-3, the space between each pair of adjacent bearings 20 is calculate to allow relief space, in which a touch point that has recently been pressure would not be pressured again at least in the next time interval. The dimensions, shape and size of the bearings 20 may be also designed to provide optimal efficiency of the system 100. The bearings 20 may be made of pressure-reducing materials that have a certain degree of elasticity to prevent them from applying too much pressure over the touch points. For example, the bearings 20 may be made of polymeric "foamy" elastic materials, rubber, and the like. As illustrated in Figures 1-2 and 4A-4B, the enveloping strip 120 completely covers the bearings 20 area in a manner that allows this strip 120 to interface a respective patient laying thereover while the weight of the patient is applied upon at least some of the bearings 20. In this particular bed configuration the dimensions of the bearings assembly 110 may allow a standard-size human patent to lay thereover. In other implementations the same method may be used for sitting postured patients where the design of the bearings assembly 110 is smaller and fits the seat of the sitting apparatus of the patient (such as designed as a chair seat) According to other embodiments the system may not include an enveloping strip, where the bearings can come in direct contact with the patient body part (e.g. back) where the actuator or any other automotive mechanism controls and operates the movement of these bearings directly. Reference is now made to Figures 8,9A and 9B, schematically illustrating a system 500 for preventing pressure ulcers having multiple and foldable bearings assemblies, according to the present invention. According to these embodiments, the system 500 includes three bearings assemblies 510a, 510b and 510c where the two external assemblies 510a and 510c be rotated (folded) one against the other to allow placing the assemblies 510a-510c over a multi-sectional treatment bed-support for allowing changing bodily positions of a respective patient laying thereover. The bearings assemblies 510a-510c may movably connect to one another via linking mechanisms such as via rotatable chains/straps or cranks. In this case the assemblies 510a-510c connect to one another via rotatable chains 530aa, 530ab, 530ba and 530bb. Each such rotatable chain 530aa, 530ab, 530ba or 530bb is anchored to the bed-support 600 via an anchoring member such as anchoring members 82a and 82b (where anchoring members anchoring rotatable chains 530aa and 530ba are not shown due to the perspectives of Figures 8 and 9A-9B). The entire set of rotatable chains 530aa-530bb and bearings assemblies 510a-510b can be moved by a single actuator (not shown) since they are linked via rotatable components. Each bearings assembly 510a-510c may additionally include strap axels such as axels 36a, 36b, 37a, 37b, 38a and 38b some connect to the linking chains 530aa-530bb and some (optionally axels 36a and 38b) may connect to the one or more actuators rotating all the assemblies 510a-510c in coordinated manner (simultaneously). As illustrated in Figures 8-9B, each bearings assembly 510a/510b/510c includes rows of bearings 30 connecting to a rotatable connecting strap 520a/520b/520c, respectively. Each row is mounted onto a bearings axis 35 for enabling the bearings 30 to rotate there-about. Each bearings axis 35 connects to the connecting strap 520a/520b/520c of its respective bearings assembly 510a/510b/510c via a connector 39. The straps 520a/520b/520c are rotated for a predefined one or more optional rotation spans such as back and forth for a respectively small span of a few centimeters for allowing rotating the spherical bearings 30 back and forth for a corresponding rotational span. The rotation of the bearings 30 will move a patient laying thereover slightly back and forth changing the interfacing touch points between the bearings 30 and the part(s) of the patient's body for applying controlled pressure over these parts in a varying continuous manner to prevent the patient from developing pressure ulcers. In the examples illustrated in Figures 8-9B the bed support 600 is not adjustable/foldable, however the configuration of the system 500 is adapted to adjustable bed or bed supports such as treatment beds having multiple sections where two adjacent sections can be rotated/folded one against the other for adjusting laying/sitting position of the patient. In case of treating bedridden patients, allowing the system 500 to be adjustable for allowing placing it over an available hospital adjustable treatment bed or bed support, tremendously improves treatment and also allows using available hospital beds or bed support without requiring building a special treatment bed, which may substantially reduce costs. The anchoring members 82a-82b can be easily attached to an available bed support via attaching means known in the art such as by screwing the anchors to the bed support. Many alterations and modifications may be made by those having ordinary skill in the art without departing from scope of the invention. as defined in the appended claims.
