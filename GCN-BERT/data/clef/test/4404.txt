TECHNICAL FIELD The disclosure relates to lubricant additives and lubricant compositions that provide improved frictional characteristics for engine oil and gear applications. In particular, the disclosure relates to a unique combination of metal containing phosphorus antiwear agents and polyols that provide synergistically improved boundary friction characteristics to a lubricant composition. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY In recent years, there has been growing concern to produce energy-efficient lubricated components. Moreover, modern engine oil specifications require lubricants to demonstrate fuel efficiency in standardized engine tests. The thickness and frictional characteristics of lubricant films are known to affect the fuel economy properties of oils. When rubbing surfaces in a machine (engine, gear system or transmission) come in contact a frictional force exists that retards the motion of the surfaces. This frictional force, called boundary friction, reduces the efficiency of the machine. Boundary friction coefficients maybe measured for a lubricant composition using the high frequency reciprocating rig (HFRR). The boundary friction measured in the HFRR is known to be related to fuel efficiency in vehicles. The ability of the lubricant composition to reduce boundary layer friction is reflected by the determined boundary lubrication regime coefficient of friction (COF). A lower value is indicative of lower friction and thus improved fuel economy. The present disclosure relates to a lubricant additive, method for reducing a boundary friction coefficient of a lubricant composition, and method for improving fuel economy. The additive includes a mixture of a) a metal-containing phosphorus antiwear compound derived from at least one secondary alcohol in an amount sufficient to provide the lubricant composition with from about 200 to about 1000 ppm by weight phosphorus, andb) a polyol derived from a diol and a mono-ol having a diol to mono-ol molar ratio ranging from about 0.3:1 to about 2.0:1, wherein the diol contains from 6 to 36 carbon atoms and the mono-ol contains from 12 to 16 carbon atoms. The polyol is present in the lubricant additive in an amount sufficient to provide a synergistic reduction in the boundary friction coefficient of the lubricant composition in combination with component (a). Another embodiment of the disclosure provides a method for reducing a boundary friction coefficient of a lubricant composition. The method includes combining a base oil of lubricating viscosity having a first boundary friction coefficient with a lubricant additive containing a) a metal-containing phosphorus antiwear compound derived from at least one secondary alcohol in an amount sufficient to provide the lubricant composition with from about 200 to about 1000 ppm by weight phosphorus, andb) a polyol derived from a diol and a mono-ol having a diol to mono-ol molar ratio ranging from about 0.3:1 to about 2.0:1, wherein the diol contains from 6 to 36 carbon atoms and the mono-ol contains from 12 to 16 carbon atoms. The polyol is present in the lubricant additive in combination with component (a) in an amount sufficient to provide a second boundary friction coefficient of the lubricant composition that is less than the first boundary friction coefficient of the lubricant composition. Yet another embodiment of the disclosure provides a method for improving the fuel economy of a vehicle. The method includes lubricating the vehicle with a lubricant composition that includes a) a base oil of lubricating viscosity; b) a metal-containing phosphorus antiwear compound derived from at least one secondary alcohol in an amount sufficient to provide the lubricant composition with from about 200 to about 1000 ppm by weight phosphorus; and c) a polyol derived from a diol and a mono-ol having a diol to monool molar ratio ranging from about 0.3:1 to about 2.0:1, wherein the diol contains from 6 to 36 carbon atoms and the mono-ol contains from 12 to 16 carbon atoms. The polyol is present in the lubricant composition in combination with component (b) in an amount sufficient to provide a boundary friction coefficient of the lubricant composition that is less than a boundary friction coefficient of the lubricant composition containing only one of component (b) or component (c). An unexpected advantage of the additive and methods described herein is that the boundary coefficient of friction is reduced by the combination of metal-containing phosphorus antiwear compound and polyol despite the fact that the same polyol may actually increase the boundary friction coefficient of the base oil in the absence of the metal-containing phosphorus antiwear compound. Additional the boundary coefficient of friction may also be lower than the boundary coefficient of friction provided by the metal-containing phosphorus antiwear compound in the absence of the polyol. Further, the effect of the combination of the metal-containing phosphorus antiwear compound and the polyol of the additive and lubricating oil compositions may be synergistic.

A "functional fluid" is a term which encompasses a variety of fluids including but not limited to tractor hydraulic fluids, power transmission fluids including automatic transmission fluids, continuously variable transmission fluids and manual transmission fluids, hydraulic fluids, including tractor hydraulic fluids, some gear oils, power steering fluids, fluids used in wind turbines, compressors, some industrial fluids, and fluids related to power train components. It should be noted that within each of these fluids such as, for example, automatic transmission fluids, there are a variety of different types of fluids due to the various transmissions having different designs which have led to the need for fluids of markedly different functional characteristics. This is contrasted by the term "lubricating fluid" which is not used to generate or transfer power. With respect to tractor hydraulic fluids, for example, these fluids are all-purpose products used for all lubricant applications in a tractor except for lubricating the engine. These lubricating applications may include lubrication of gearboxes, power take-off and clutch(es), rear axles, reduction gears, wet brakes, and hydraulic accessories.

Engine oils of the present disclosure may be formulated by the addition of one or more additives, as described in detail below, to an appropriate base oil formulation. The additives may be combined with a base oil in the form of an additive package (or concentrate) or, alternatively, maybe combined individually with a base oil. The fully formulated engine oil may exhibit improved performance properties, based on the additives added and their respective proportions. Additional details and advantages of the disclosure will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and/or may be learned by practice of the disclosure. The details and advantages of the disclosure may be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the disclosure, as claimed. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Metal-Containing Phosphorus Antiwear Component As set forth above, the present disclosure relates to a lubricant additive, a method for reducing a boundary friction coefficient of a lubricant composition, and method for improving fuel economy. Fuel economy may be measured using well-known measurement methods such as the various fuel economy tests set forth in the ASTM standards. Different fuel economy tests may be used for different types of engines as set forth in the ASTM standards. An important component of the additive and methods described herein is a metal-containing phosphorus antiwear compound derived from at least one secondary alcohol. Such antiwear agents typically comprise dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphate metal salts wherein the metal maybe an alkali or alkaline earth metal, or aluminum, lead, tin, molybdenum, manganese, nickel, copper, titanium, or zinc. The zinc salts are most commonly used in lubricating oils. Dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphate metal salts may be prepared in accordance with known techniques by first forming a dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphoric acid (DDPA), usually by reaction of one or more alcohols or a phenol with P2S5 and then neutralizing the formed DDPA with a metal compound. For example, a dithiophosphoric acid may be made by reacting primary, secondary, or mixtures of primary and secondary alcohols with P2S5. To make the metal salt, any basic or neutral metal compound may be used but the oxides, hydroxides and carbonates are most generally used. Commercial additives frequently contain an excess of metal due to the use of an excess of the basic metal compound in the neutralization reaction. The zinc dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphates (ZDDP) that are typically used are oil soluble salts of dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphoric acids and maybe represented by the following formula: wherein R8 and R9 may be the same or different hydrocarbyl radicals containing from 1 to 18, typically 2 to 12, carbon atoms and including radicals such as alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, arylalkyl, alkaryl and cycloaliphatic radicals. Particularly desired as R8 and R9 groups are alkyl groups of 2 to 8 carbon atoms. Thus, the radicals may, for example, be ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, sec-butyl, amyl, n-hexyl, i-hexyl, n-octyl, decyl, dodecyl, octadecyl, 2-ethylhexyl, phenyl, butylphenyl, cyclohexyl, methylcyclopentyl, propenyl, butenyl. In order to obtain oil solubility, the total number of carbon atoms (i.e. R8 and R9) in the dithiophosphoric acid will generally be about 5 or greater. The zinc dihydrocarbyl dithiophosphate may therefore comprise zinc dialkyl dithiophosphates. In order to limit the amount of phosphorus introduced into the lubricating oil composition by ZDDP to no more than 0.1 wt. % (1000 ppm), the ZDDP should desirably be added to the lubricating oil compositions in amounts no greater than from about 1.1 to 1.3 wt. %, based upon the total weight of the lubricating oil composition. For example, the phosphorus-based antiwear agent maybe present in a lubricating composition in an amount sufficient to provide from about 200 to about 1000 ppm by weight phosphorus based on a total weight of the lubricant composition. As a further example, the phosphorus-based antiwear agent may be present in a lubricating composition in an amount sufficient to provide from about 400 to about 800 ppm by weight phosphorus to a fully formulated lubricant composition. According to embodiments of the disclosure, the metal-containing phosphorus antiwear compound may include compounds made from primary alcohols and compounds made from secondary alcohols or compounds made from a combination of primary and secondary alcohols. In other words, the metal-containing phosphorus antiwear component includes at least one compound containing moieties derived from a secondary alcohol. Hence, the metal-containing phosphorous component may include a mixture of (i) a metal-containing phosphorus antiwear compound derived from primary alcohols and (ii) a metal-containing phosphorus antiwear compound derived from secondary alcohols, wherein a weight ratio of (i) to (ii) based on ppm by weight phosphorus provided by (i) and (ii) to the lubricant composition ranges from 0:1 to about 4:1, such as from about 0.25:1 to about 3:1, or from about 0.5:1 to about 2:1, or 1:1. In another embodiment, the metal-containing phosphorus antiwear component may be derived from a mixture of primary and secondary alcohols such that a molar ratio of primary alcohols to secondary alcohols in the component ranges from about 0.25:1 to about 4:1. Polyol Component Another important component of the additive and methods described herein is a polyol as generally disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2012/0202723. The polyol is derived from a diol and a mono-ol having a diol to mono-ol molar ratio ranging from about 0.3:1 to about 2.0:1, wherein the diol contains from 6 to 36 carbon atoms and the mono-ol contains from 12 to 16 carbon atoms. Exemplary polyols that may be used, include, but are not limited to polyols derived from a linear or branched alkyl diol having 10 carbon atoms reacted with a linear or branched alkyl mono-ol having 12 carbon atoms with a diol to mono-ol molar ratio of 0.3:1; a linear or branched alkyl diol having 36 carbon atoms reacted with a linear or branched alkyl mono-ol having 16 carbon atoms with a diol to mono-ol molar ratio of 0.3:1; a linear or branched alkyl diol having 10 carbon atoms reacted with a linear or branched alkyl mono-ol having 16 carbon atoms with a diol to mono-ol molar ratio of 1:1; a linear or branched alkyl diol having 10 carbon atoms reacted with a linear or branched alkyl mono-ol having 16 carbon atoms with a diol to mono-ol molar ratio of 2:1; a mixture of (i) a linear or branched alkyl diol having 6 carbon atoms and (ii) a linear or branched alkyl diol having 10 carbon atoms reacted with a linear or branched alkyl mono-ol having 16 carbon atoms with a diol to mono-ol molar ratio of 1:1; a mixture of (i) a linear or branched alkyl diol having 6 carbon atoms and (ii) a linear or branched alkyl diol having 10 carbon atoms reacted with a linear or branched alkyl mono-ol having 16 carbon atoms with a diol to mono-ol molar ratio of 2:1; a mixture of (i) a linear or branched alkyl diol having 36 carbon atoms and (ii) a linear or branched alkyl diol having 10 carbon atoms reacted with a linear or branched alkyl mono-ol having 16 carbon atoms with a diol to mono-ol molar ratio of 1:1; and a mixture of (i) a linear or branched alkyl diol having 36 carbon atoms and (ii) a linear or branched alkyl diol having 10 carbon atoms reacted with a linear or branched alkyl mono-ol having 16 carbon atoms with a diol to mono-ol molar ratio of 2:1. Other polyols described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2012/0202723 may be suitable for providing a similar synergistic reduction in the boundary coefficient of friction in combination with the metal-containing phosphorus antiwear component described above. The polyol may be present in the lubricant additive in an amount sufficient to provide a synergistic reduction in the boundary friction coefficient of the lubricant composition in combination with the metal-containing phosphorus antiwear component. Accordingly, the polyol component may be present in a lubricant composition in an amount ranging from about 0.2 to 2.0 weight percent based on a total weight of the lubricant composition. Base Oil The base oil used in the lubricating oil compositions herein may be selected from any of the base oils in Groups I-V as specified in the American Petroleum Institute (API) Base Oil Interchangeability Guidelines. The five base oil groups are as follows: Table 1Base oil CategorySulfur (%)Saturates (%)Viscosity IndexGroup I> 0.03and/or<9080 to 120Group II≤0.03and≥9080 to 120Group III≤0.03and≥90≥120Group IVAll polyalphaolefins (PAOs)Group VAll others not included in Groups I, II, III, or IV Groups I, II, and III are mineral oil process stocks. Group IV base oils contain true synthetic molecular species, which are produced by polymerization of olefinically unsaturated hydrocarbons. Many Group V base oils are also true synthetic products and may include diesters, polyol esters, polyalkylene glycols, alkylated aromatics, polyphosphate esters, polyvinyl ethers, and/or polyphenyl ethers, and the like, but may also be naturally occurring oils, such as vegetable oils. It should be noted that although Group III base oils are derived from mineral oil, the rigorous processing that these fluids undergo causes their physical properties to be very similar to some true synthetics, such as PAOs. Therefore, oils derived from Group III base oils may be referred to as synthetic fluids in the industry. The base oil used in the disclosed lubricating oil composition may be a mineral oil, animal oil, vegetable oil, synthetic oil, or mixtures thereof. Suitable oils maybe derived from hydrocracking, hydrogenation, hydrofinishing, unrefined, refined, and re-refined oils, and mixtures thereof. Unrefined oils are those derived from a natural, mineral, or synthetic source without or with little further purification treatment. Refined oils are similar to the unrefined oils except that they have been treated in one or more purification steps, which may result in the improvement of one or more properties. Examples of suitable purification techniques are solvent extraction, secondary distillation, acid or base extraction, filtration, percolation, and the like. Oils refined to the quality of an edible may or may not be useful. Edible oils may also be called white oils. In some embodiments, lubricant compositions are free of edible or white oils. Re-refined oils are also known as reclaimed or reprocessed oils. These oils are obtained similarly to refined oils using the same or similar processes. Often these oils are additionally processed by techniques directed to removal of spent additives and oil breakdown products. Mineral oils may include oils obtained by drilling or from plants and animals or any mixtures thereof. For example such oils may include, but are not limited to, castor oil, lard oil, olive oil, peanut oil, corn oil, soybean oil, and linseed oil, as well as mineral lubricating oils, such as liquid petroleum oils and solvent-treated or acid-treated mineral lubricating oils of the paraffinic, naphthenic or mixed paraffinic-naphthenic types. Such oils may be partially or fully hydrogenated, if desired. Oils derived from coal or shale may also be useful. Useful synthetic lubricating oils may include hydrocarbon oils such as polymerized, oligomerized, or interpolymerized olefins (e.g., polybutylenes, polypropylenes, propyleneisobutylene copolymers); poly(1-hexenes), poly(1-octenes), trimers or oligomers of 1-decene, e.g., poly(1-decenes), such materials being often referred to as α-olefins, and mixtures thereof; alkyl-benzenes (e.g. dodecylbenzenes, tetradecylbenzenes, dinonylbenzenes, di-(2-ethylhexyl)-benzenes); polyphenyls (e.g., biphenyls, terphenyls, alkylated polyphenyls); diphenyl alkanes, alkylated diphenyl alkanes, alkylated diphenyl ethers and alkylated diphenyl sulfides and the derivatives, analogs and homologs thereof or mixtures thereof. Polyalphaolefins are typically hydrogenated materials. Other synthetic lubricating oils include polyol esters, diesters, liquid esters of phosphorus-containing acids (e.g., tricresyl phosphate, trioctyl phosphate, and the diethyl ester of decane phosphonic acid), or polymeric tetrahydrofurans. Synthetic oils may be produced by Fischer-Tropsch reactions and typically may be hydroisomerized Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbons or waxes. In one embodiment oils may be prepared by a Fischer-Tropsch gas-to-liquid synthetic procedure as well as other gas-to-liquid oils. The amount of the oil of lubricating viscosity present may be the balance remaining after subtracting from 100 wt% the sum of the foregoing additive components in combination with other performance additives inclusive of viscosity index improver(s) and/or pour point depressant(s) and/or other top treat additives. For example, the oil of lubricating viscosity that maybe present in a finished fluid may be a major amount, such as greater than about 50 wt%, greater than about 60 wt%, greater than about 70 wt%, greater than about 80 wt%, greater than about 85 wt%, or greater than about 90 wt%. Antioxidants The lubricating oil compositions herein also may optionally contain one or more antioxidants. Antioxidant compounds are known and include for example, phenates, phenate sulfides, sulfurized olefins, phosphosulfurized terpenes, sulfurized esters, aromatic amines, alkylated diphenylamines (e.g., nonyl diphenylamine, di-nonyl diphenylamine, octyl diphenylamine, di-octyl diphenylamine), phenyl-alpha-naphthylamines, alkylated phenyl-alpha-naphthylamines, hindered non-aromatic amines, phenols, hindered phenols, oil-soluble molybdenum compounds, macromolecular antioxidants, or mixtures thereof. Antioxidant compounds maybe used alone or in combination. The hindered phenol antioxidant may contain a secondary butyl and/or a tertiary butyl group as a sterically hindering group. The phenol group may be further substituted with a hydrocarbyl group and/or a bridging group linking to a second aromatic group. Examples of suitable hindered phenol antioxidants include 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, 4-methyl-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, 4-ethyl-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, 4-propyl-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol or 4-butyl-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol, or 4-dodecyl-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol. In one embodiment the hindered phenol antioxidant may be an ester and may include, e.g., IRGANOX™ L-135 available from BASF or an addition product derived from 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol and an alkyl acrylate, wherein the alkyl group may contain about 1 to about 18, or about 2 to about 12, or about 2 to about 8, or about 2 to about 6, or about 4 carbon atoms. Another commercially available hindered phenol antioxidant may be an ester and may include ETHANOX™ 4716 available from Albemarle Corporation. Useful antioxidants may include diarylamines and high molecular weight phenols. In an embodiment, the lubricating oil composition may contain a mixture of a diarylamine and a high molecular weight phenol, such that each antioxidant may be present in an amount sufficient to provide up to about 5%, by weight, based upon the final weight of the lubricating oil composition. In an embodiment, the antioxidant may be a mixture of about 0.3 to about 1.5% diarylamine and about 0.4 to about 2.5% high molecular weight phenol, by weight, based upon the final weight of the lubricating oil composition. Examples of suitable olefins that may be sulfurized to form a sulfurized olefin include propylene, butylene, isobutylene, polyisobutylene, pentene, hexene, heptene, octene, nonene, decene, undecene, dodecene, tridecene, tetradecene, pentadecene, hexadecene, heptadecene, octadecene, nonadecene, eicosene or mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, hexadecene, heptadecene, octadecene, nonadecene, eicosene or mixtures thereof and their dimers, trimers and tetramers are especially useful olefins. Alternatively, the olefin may be a Diels-Alder adduct of a diene such as 1,3-butadiene and an unsaturated ester, such as, butylacrylate. Another class of sulfurized olefin includes sulfurized fatty acids and their esters. The fatty acids are often obtained from vegetable oil or animal oil and typically contain about 4 to about 22 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable fatty acids and their esters include triglycerides, oleic acid, linoleic acid, palmitoleic acid or mixtures thereof. Often, the fatty acids are obtained from lard oil, tall oil, peanut oil, soybean oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower seed oil or mixtures thereof. Fatty acids and/or ester may be mixed with olefins, such as α-olefins. The one or more antioxidant(s) may be present in ranges about 0 wt% to about 20 wt%, or about 0.1 wt% to about 10 wt%, or about 1 wt% to about 5 wt%, of the lubricating composition. Auxiliary Antiwear Agents The lubricating oil compositions herein may also optionally contain one or more auxiliary antiwear agents. Examples of suitable auxiliary antiwear agents include, but are not limited to, a metal thiophosphate; a phosphoric acid ester or salt thereof; a phosphate ester(s); a phosphite; a phosphorus-containing carboxylic ester, ether, or amide; a sulfurized olefin; thiocarbamate-containing compounds including, thiocarbamate esters, alkylene-coupled thiocarbamates, and bis(S-alkyldithiocarbamyl)disulfides; and mixtures thereof.

Further examples of suitable antiwear agents include titanium compounds, tartrates, tartrimides, oil soluble amine salts of phosphorus compounds, sulfurized olefins, phosphites (such as dibutyl phosphite), phosphonates, thiocarbamate-containing compounds, such as thiocarbamate esters, thiocarbamate amides, thiocarbamic ethers, alkylene-coupled thiocarbamates, and bis(S-alkyldithiocarbamyl) disulfides. The tartrate or tartrimide may contain alkyl-ester groups, where the sum of carbon atoms on the alkyl groups maybe at least 8. The antiwear agent may in one embodiment include a citrate. The auxiliary antiwear agent may be present in ranges including about 0 wt% to about 10 wt%, or about 0.01 wt% to about 5 wt%, or about 0.05 wt% to about 2 wt%, or about 0.1 wt% to about 1 wt% of the lubricating composition. Boron-Containing Compounds The lubricating oil compositions herein may optionally contain one or more boron-containing compounds. Examples of boron-containing compounds include borate esters, borated fatty amines, borated epoxides, borated detergents, and borated dispersants, such as borated succinimide dispersants, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,883,057. The boron-containing compound, if present, can be used in an amount sufficient to provide up to about 8 wt%, about 0.01 wt% to about 7 wt%, about 0.05 wt% to about 5 wt%, or about 0.1 wt% to about 3 wt% of the lubricating composition. Detergents The lubricant composition may optionally further comprise one or more neutral, low based, or overbased detergents, and mixtures thereof. Suitable detergent substrates include phenates, sulfur containing phenates, sulfonates, calixarates, salixarates, salicylates, carboxylic acids, phosphorus acids, mono- and/or di-thiophosphoric acids, alkyl phenols, sulfur coupled alkyl phenol compounds, or methylene bridged phenols. Suitable detergents and their methods of preparation are described in greater detail in numerous patent publications, including US 7,732,390 and references cited therein. The detergent substrate may be salted with an alkali or alkaline earth metal such as, but not limited to, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, lithium, barium, or mixtures thereof. In some embodiments, the detergent is free of barium. A suitable detergent may include alkali or alkaline earth metal salts of petroleum sulfonic acids and long chain mono- or di-alkylarylsulfonic acids with the aryl group being benzyl, tolyl, and xylyl. Examples of suitable detergents include, but are not limited to, calcium phenates, calcium sulfur containing phenates, calcium sulfonates, calcium calixarates, calcium salixarates, calcium salicylates, calcium carboxylic acids, calcium phosphorus acids, calcium mono- and/or di-thiophosphoric acids, calcium alkyl phenols, calcium sulfur coupled alkyl phenol compounds, calcium methylene bridged phenols, magnesium phenates, magnesium sulfur containing phenates, magnesium sulfonates, magnesium calixarates, magnesium salixarates, magnesium salicylates, magnesium carboxylic acids, magnesium phosphorus acids, magnesium mono- and/or di-thiophosphoric acids, magnesium alkyl phenols, magnesium sulfur coupled alkyl phenol compounds, magnesium methylene bridged phenols, sodium phenates, sodium sulfur containing phenates, sodium sulfonates, sodium calixarates, sodium salixarates, sodium salicylates, sodium carboxylic acids, sodium phosphorus acids, sodium mono- and/or di-thiophosphoric acids, sodium alkyl phenols, sodium sulfur coupled alkyl phenol compounds, or sodium methylene bridged phenols. Overbased detergent additives are well known in the art and may be alkali or alkaline earth metal overbased detergent additives. Such detergent additives may be prepared by reacting a metal oxide or metal hydroxide with a substrate and carbon dioxide gas. The substrate is typically an acid, for example, an acid such as an aliphatic substituted sulfonic acid, an aliphatic substituted carboxylic acid, or an aliphatic substituted phenol. The terminology "overbased" relates to metal salts, such as metal salts of sulfonates, carboxylates, and phenates, wherein the amount of metal present exceeds the stoichiometric amount. Such salts may have a conversion level in excess of 100% (i.e., they may comprise more than 100% of the theoretical amount of metal needed to convert the acid to its "normal," "neutral" salt). The expression "metal ratio," often abbreviated as MR, is used to designate the ratio of total chemical equivalents of metal in the overbased salt to chemical equivalents of the metal in a neutral salt according to known chemical reactivity and stoichiometry. In a normal or neutral salt, the metal ratio is one and in an overbased salt, MR, is greater than one. They are commonly referred to as overbased, hyperbased, or superbased salts and maybe salts of organic sulfur acids, carboxylic acids, or phenols. Examples of suitable overbased detergents include, but are not limited to, overbased calcium phenates, overbased calcium sulfur containing phenates, overbased calcium sulfonates, overbased calcium calixarates, overbased calcium salixarates, overbased calcium salicylates, overbased calcium carboxylic acids, overbased calcium phosphorus acids, overbased calcium mono- and/or di-thiophosphoric acids, overbased calcium alkyl phenols, overbased calcium sulfur coupled alkyl phenol compounds, overbased calcium methylene bridged phenols, overbased magnesium phenates, overbased magnesium sulfur containing phenates, overbased magnesium sulfonates, overbased magnesium calixarates, overbased magnesium salixarates, overbased magnesium salicylates, overbased magnesium carboxylic acids, overbased magnesium phosphorus acids, overbased magnesium mono- and/or di-thiophosphoric acids, overbased magnesium alkyl phenols, overbased magnesium sulfur coupled alkyl phenol compounds, or overbased magnesium methylene bridged phenols. The overbased detergent may have a metal to substrate ratio of from 1.1:1, or from 2:1, or from 4:1, or from 5:1, or from 7:1, or from 10:1. In some embodiments, a detergent is effective at reducing or preventing rust in an engine. The detergent may be present at about 0 wt% to about 10 wt%, or about 0.1 wt% to about 8 wt%, or about 1 wt% to about 4 wt%, or greater than about 4 wt% to about 8 wt%. Dispersants The lubricant composition may optionally further comprise one or more dispersants or mixtures thereof. Dispersants are often known as ashless-type dispersants because, prior to mixing in a lubricating oil composition, they do not contain ash-forming metals and they do not normally contribute any ash when added to a lubricant. Ashless type dispersants are characterized by a polar group attached to a relatively high molecular weight hydrocarbon chain. Typical ashless dispersants include N-substituted long chain alkenyl succinimides. Examples of N-substituted long chain alkenyl succinimides include polyisobutylene succinimide with number average molecular weight of the polyisobutylene substituent in the range about 350 to about 50,000, or to about 5,000, or to about 3,000. Succinimide dispersants and their preparation are disclosed, for instance in U.S. Pat. No. 7,897,696 or U.S. Pat. No. 4,234,435. The polyolefin may be prepared from polymerizable monomers containing about 2 to about 16, or about 2 to about 8, or about 2 to about 6 carbon atoms. Succinimide dispersants are typically the imide formed from a polyamine, typically a poly(ethyleneamine). In an embodiment the present disclosure further comprises at least one polyisobutylene succinimide dispersant derived from polyisobutylene with number average molecular weight in the range about 350 to about 50,000, or to about 5000, or to about 3000. The polyisobutylene succinimide maybe used alone or in combination with other dispersants. In some embodiments, polyisobutylene, when included, may have greater than 50 mol%, greater than 60 mol%, greater than 70 mol%, greater than 80 mol%, or greater than 90 mol% content of terminal double bonds. Such PIB is also referred to as highly reactive PIB ("HR-PIB"). HR-PIB having a number average molecular weight ranging from about 800 to about 5000 is suitable for use in embodiments of the present disclosure. Conventional PIB typically has less than 50 mol%, less than 40 mol%, less than 30 mol%, less than 20 mol%, or less than 10 mol% content of terminal double bonds. An HR-PIB having a number average molecular weight ranging from about 900 to about 3000 maybe suitable. Such HR-PIB is commercially available, or can be synthesized by the polymerization of isobutene in the presence of a non-chlorinated catalyst such as boron trifluoride, as described in US Patent No. 4,152,499 to Boerzel, et al. and U.S. Patent No. 5,739,355 to Gateau, et al. When used in the aforementioned thermal ene reaction, HR-PIB may lead to higher conversion rates in the reaction, as well as lower amounts of sediment formation, due to increased reactivity. A suitable method is described in U.S. Patent No. 7,897,696. In one embodiment the present disclosure further comprises at least one dispersant derived from polyisobutylene succinic anhydride ("PIBSA"). The PIBSA may have an average of between about 1.0 and about 2.0 succinic acid moieties per polymer. The % actives of the alkenyl or alkyl succinic anhydride can be determined using a chromatographic technique. This method is described in column 5 and 6 in U.S. Pat. No. 5,334,321. The percent conversion of the polyolefin is calculated from the % actives using the equation in column 5 and 6 in U.S. Pat. No. 5,334,321. Unless stated otherwise, all percentages are in weight percent and all molecular weights are number average molecular weights. In one embodiment, the dispersant may be derived from a polyalphaolefin (PAO) succinic anhydride. In one embodiment, the dispersant may be derived from olefin maleic anhydride copolymer. As an example, the dispersant may be described as a poly-PIBSA. In an embodiment, the dispersant may be derived from an anhydride which is grafted to an ethylene-propylene copolymer. One class of suitable dispersants may be Mannich bases. Mannich bases are materials that are formed by the condensation of a higher molecular weight, alkyl substituted phenol, a polyalkylene polyamine, and an aldehyde such as formaldehyde. Mannich bases are described in more detail in U.S. Patent No. 3,634,515. A suitable class of dispersants may be high molecular weight esters or half ester amides. A suitable dispersant may also be post-treated by conventional methods by a reaction with any of a variety of agents. Among these are boron, urea, thiourea, dimercaptothiadiazoles, carbon disulfide, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, hydrocarbon-substituted succinic anhydrides, maleic anhydride, nitriles, epoxides, carbonates, cyclic carbonates, hindered phenolic esters, and phosphorus compounds.

Examples 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64 and 66 showed that Polyols 5-10 at 0.2 to 1.0 wt.% in the absence of ZDDP increased the HFRR coefficient of friction compared to the base oil HFRR coefficient of friction by from 5 to 26 percent at 0.2 to 1.0 weight percent polyol in the lubricant composition. Example 54 showed a slight decrease in coefficient of friction in the absence of ZDDP at 1.0 wt.% of Polyol 7. Examples 2-5 and 24-28, with or without polyol had a % reduction in coefficient of friction ranging from 17 to 30 percent when the ZDDP-1 made from all primary alcohols was used. Examples 1-4 showed that there as actually a decrease in the % reduction of the HFRR coefficient of friction when ZDDP-1 was combined with Polyol -1 at 0.5 wt.% and at 200 and 800 ppm by weight total phosphorus in the lubricant composition compared to the same ZDDP-1 in the absence of Polyol-1.

All of the ZDDP's 2, 3 and 5 in the presence of Polyols 1-4 showed a significant increase in % reduction of the HFRR coefficient of friction compared to the same ZDDP's in the absence of the polyols as shown by Examples 30-33 compared to Example 29, Examples 35-38 compared to Example 34, and Examples 40-43 compared to Example 39. Examples 19, 21 and 23 showed a mixture primary and secondary ZDDP's (ZDDP's 5, 6 and 7) at a ratio of 1:3 to 3:1 showed a beneficial reduction on the HFRR coefficient of friction in the presence of polyol similar to the reduction in HFRR coefficient of friction achieved by ZDDP-2 in the presence of polyol. Finally, Examples 45, 47, 49, 51, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 63, 65, and 67 containing ZDDP-3 at 820 ppm total phosphorus showed significant improvements in % reduction of the HFRR coefficient of friction when combined with Polyols 7-10 at treat rates of polyol of 0.2 to 1.0 wt.% of the total weight of the lubricant composition compared to Examples 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, and 66 for Polyols 5-10 alone. The foregoing examples showed there was a synergistic increase in the % reduction of the HFRR coefficient of friction compared to the examples containing only one of the ZDDP or Polyol component.
