[Technical Field] The present disclosure relates to a laminate for use in a printed circuit board, and a resin composition for forming an insulation layer and/or an adhesive layer, which are/is included in the laminate. [Background Art] A laminate for a printed circuit board includes a printed circuit layer in which an electronic circuit is formed and an electronic device such as a semiconductor is mounted, an insulation layer which conducts heat emitted from the electronic device, and a heat dissipation layer which is in contact with the insulation layer and emits heat to the outside. The laminate for a printed circuit board is manufactured by laminating a flexible insulation film (which serves as an insulation layer) on a metal base layer (which serves as a heat dissipation layer) for improving electrical properties such as voltage resistance and thermal conductivity, and formability such as bendability (bending processability) and punchability, and a thermoplastic polyimide or an epoxy resin is used as an adhesive in order to increase adhesive force between the metal base layer and the insulation film. However, for the thermoplastic polyimide, curing is conducted under high temperature conditions, and such curing conditions have problems in that photo solder resist (PSR) cracks are caused during the oxidation of the metal base layer and the manufacture of the printed circuit board, and adhesiveness and heat resistance deteriorate due to the compatibility of the epoxy resin with the insulation film. Meanwhile, a technology of using a product obtained by mixing a rubber, such as acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR) or carboxyl terminated butadiene acrylonitrile (CTBN), with an epoxy resin as an adhesive has been introduced in order to improve adhesiveness and formability, but there is a limitation on obtaining desired heat resistance, insulation properties, formabilityformability, and the like required for a laminate for a printed circuit board. [Disclosure] [Technical Problem] In order to solve the aforementioned problems, an object of the present disclosure is to provide a resin composition which exhibits high adhesiveness to a metal base layer, and a laminate for a printed circuit board, which includes the resin composition and has excellent heat resistance, insulation properties, formability, and the like. [Technical Solution] In order to achieve the aforementioned object, the present disclosure provides a resin composition including: a rubber-modified epoxy resin; an epoxy resin; an inorganic filler; and a curing agent. Here, the rubber-modified epoxy resin may be an epoxy resin modified with rubber selected from the group consisting of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), carboxyl terminated butadiene acrylonitrile (CTBN) rubber, epoxy terminated butadiene acrylonitrile (ETBN) rubber, and amine terminated butadiene acrylonitrile (ATBN) rubber. Further, the rubber-modified epoxy resin may have an epoxy equivalent weight of 300 to 500 g/eq and a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 30,000 to 60,000. Meanwhile, the present disclosure provides a laminate for a printed circuit board, including: a metal base layer; and a resin layer cured (hardened) by applying the resin composition on the metal base layer. Further, the present disclosure provides a printed circuit board including the laminate for a printed circuit board. [Description of Drawings] FIG. 1 is a cross-sectional view illustrating a laminate for a printed circuit board according to the present disclosure. FIGS. 2 and 3 are cross-sectional views illustrating a printed circuit board according to the present disclosure. [Best Mode] Hereinafter, the present disclosure will be described. 1. Resin Composition A resin composition of the present disclosure includes a rubber-modified epoxy resin, an epoxy resin, an inorganic filler, and a curing agent. The rubber-modified epoxy resin included in the resin composition of the present disclosure serves to increase adhesiveness, heat resistance, and insulation properties of the resin composition. In general, rubber is a polymer material having a linear structure, and has a small amount of unreacted groups. The unreacted groups of rubber degrades the crosslinking density of rubber to be cured because it is difficult for the unreacted groups to participate in curing reactions, and thus, are ultimately responsible for deterioration in heat resistance. Accordingly, the present disclosure uses a rubber-modified epoxy resin with curing reactivity improved while minimizing production of the unreacted groups of rubber by polymerizing the rubber with an epoxy resin. The rubber-modified epoxy resin of the present disclosure is preferably an epoxy resin modified with rubber selected from the group consisting of acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR), carboxyl terminated butadiene acrylonitrile (CTBN) rubber, epoxy terminated butadiene acrylonitrile (ETBN) rubber, and amine terminated butadiene acrylonitrile (ATBN) rubber. Here, the rubber-modified epoxy resin is more preferably a resin modified by polymerizing carboxyl terminated butadiene acrylonitrile (CTBN) rubber with a phenol novolac-type epoxy resin, or a resin modified by polymerizing carboxyl terminated butadiene acrylonitrile (CTBN) rubber with a bisphenol A-type epoxy resin. Meanwhile, when rubber is polymerized with an epoxy resin, the reaction ratio (wt%) is not particularly limited, but in consideration of adhesiveness, heat resistance, curing reactivity, and the like, rubber is reacted with the epoxy resin at a ratio of preferably 2:8 to 6:4, and more preferably 3:7. It is preferred that the rubber-modified epoxy resin has an epoxy equivalent weight of 300 to 500 g/eq and a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 30,000 to 60,000. This is because when a rubber-modified epoxy resin having an equivalent weight and a weight average molecular weight within the range is used, the adhesiveness, heat resistance, and insulation properties of the resin composition may be further increased. The term 'epoxy equivalent weight' in the present disclosure may be defined as a molecular weight of an epoxy copolymer per epoxy group. Meanwhile, the content of the rubber-modified epoxy resin included in the resin composition of the present disclosure is not particularly limited, but in consideration of physical properties (adhesiveness, heat resistance, insulation properties, and the like) and manufacturing efficiency (manufacturing processes and costs) of the resin composition, it is preferred that the rubber-modified epoxyresin is included in an amount of 8 to 16 wt% based on 100 wt% of the resin composition. The epoxy resin included in the resin composition of the present disclosure improves the crosslinking formability of the resin composition, thereby serving to stabilize adhesiveness, heat resistance, insulation properties, and environmental reliability of the resin composition. The epoxy resin is not particularly limited as long as the resin is publicly known in the art, but it is preferred to use one or more selected from the group consisting of a bisphenol A-type epoxy resin, a hydrogenated bisphenol A-type epoxy resin, a bisphenol F-type epoxy resin, a bisphenol S-type epoxy resin, a novolac-type epoxy resin, a cresol novolac-type epoxy resin, a phenol novolac-type epoxy resin, a dicyclopentadiene-type epoxy resin, a triphenylmethane-type epoxy resin, a naphthalene-type epoxy resin, a biphenyl-type epoxy resin, a hydrogenated biphenyl-type epoxy resin, and a phosphorus (P)-containing epoxy resin. Meanwhile, the content of the epoxy resin included in the resin composition of the present disclosure is not particularly limited, but in consideration of physical properties (adhesiveness, heat resistance, insulation properties, and the like) and manufacturing efficiency (manufacturing processes and costs) of the resin composition, it is preferred that the epoxy resin is included in an amount of 50 to 65 wt% based on 100 wt% of the resin composition. The inorganic filler included in the resin composition of the present disclosure serves to adjust the viscosity of the resin composition (improve formability) and increase thermal conductivity of the cured resin composition. The inorganic filler is not particularly limited as long as the filler is publicly known in the art, but it is preferred to use one or more selected from the group consisting of silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, zinc oxide, aluminum nitride, silicon nitride, boron nitride, silica, talc, calcium carbonate, and magnesium carbonate. Further, it is preferred to use the inorganic filler having an average particle diameter of about 1 µm or less. Specifically, it is more preferred to use the inorganic filler in which particles having a particle diameter of 1 µm or less and particles having a particle diameter of more than 1 µm and 5 µm or less are included in an amount of 60 to 80 vol% and 20 to 40 vol%, based on 100 vol% of the inorganic filler. The content of the inorganic filler included in the resin composition of the present disclosure is not particularly limited, but in consideration of viscosity, thermal conductivity, workability, formability, and the like of the resin composition, it is preferred that the inorganic filler is included in an amount of 5 to 10 wt% based on 100 wt% of the resin composition. The curing agent (hardener) included in the resin composition of the present disclosure serves to cause a curing reaction of the rubber-modified epoxy resin with the epoxy resin. The curing agent is not particularly limited as long as the curing agent is publicly known in the art, but it is preferred to use one or more selected from the group consisting of amine-based curing agents. In addition, the content of the curing agent included in the resin composition of the present disclosure is not particularly limited, but in consideration of curability (crosslinking density), workability, formability, and the like of the resin composition, it is preferred that the curing agent is included in an amount of 20 to 30 wt% based on 100 wt% of the resin composition. Meanwhile, the resin composition of the present disclosure may further include a curing accelerator in order to increase the curing reaction rate of the composition. The curing accelerator is not particularly limited as long as the accelerator is publicly known in the art, but it is preferred to use one or more selected from the group consisting of a tertiary amine-based curing accelerator, such as benzyldimethylamine, triethanolamine, triethylenediamine, dimethylaminoethanol, and tri(dimethylaminomethyl)phenol; an imidazole-based curing accelerator, such as 2-methylimidazole and 2-phenylimidazole; an organic phosphine-based curing accelerator, such as triphenylphosphine, diphenylphosphine, and phenylphosphine; and tetraphenylboron salts, such as tetraphenylphosphonium tetraphenylborate and triphenylphosphine tetraphenylborate. Furthermore, the content of the curing accelerator included in the resin composition of the present disclosure is also not particularly limited, but in consideration of curing reactivity, workability, formability, and the like of the resin composition, it is preferred that the curing accelerator is included in an amount of 1 wt% or less, specifically, 0.001 to 1 wt% based on 100 wt% of the resin composition.

The resin composition of the present disclosure may be used anywhere adhesiveness and/or insulation properties are needed, but it is preferred to use the resin composition in manufacturing a flexible printed circuit board. 2. Laminate for Printed Circuit Board and Printed Circuit Board Including the Same The present disclosure provides a laminate for a printed circuit board, which includes a metal base layer 11 and a resin layer 12 (see FIG. 1). The metal base layer 11 included in the laminate for a printed circuit board according to the present disclosure serves as a heat dissipation layer which emits heat to the outside. A material, which may be used as the metal base layer 11, is not particularly limited, but it is possible to use aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), tin (Sn), gold (Au), silver (Ag), or a mixture thereof. Here, in consideration of heat dissipation properties and conductivity, and the like, it is preferred to use aluminum for the metal base layer 11. The resin layer 12 included in the laminate for a printed circuit board according to the present disclosure is cured by applying the resin composition described above on the metal base layer 11, and serves as an insulation layer and an adhesive layer. Here, a method for applying the resin composition is not particularly limited as long as the method is publicly known in the art. Further, conditions of curing the resin composition are not particularly limited, but it is preferred that the resin composition is cured under a predetermined pressure condition at 160°C or more for 2 hours. The resin layer 12 is formed of the resin composition and thus is excellent in heat resistance, insulation properties, and formability while exhibiting high adhesion strength with the metal base layer 11. Accordingly, the laminate for a printed circuit board according to the present disclosure, which includes the resin layer 12, may exhibit excellent heat resistance, insulation properties, and formability. Meanwhile, the present disclosure also provides a printed circuit board including the laminate for a printed circuit board. Specifically, the printed circuit board of the present disclosure may have a structure in which a resin layer 12 serving as an insulation layer and an adhesive layer is inserted between a metal base layer 11a serving as a heat dissipation layer and a metal layer 11b for forming a circuit pattern (see FIG. 2), or may have a structure of a metal base layer 11a/a first resin layer 12a/a thermosetting polyimide film 13/a second resin layer 12b/a metal layer 11b for forming a circuit pattern, in order to increase insulation properties, durability, heat resistance, and the like (see FIG. 3).

On the contrary, it can be confirmed that Comparative Example 1, in which the polyimide resin composition was used, was good in heat resistance, insulation properties, and adhesiveness, but the curing reactivity deteriorated when the curing temperature was set to be equal to that of the resin composition of the present disclosure (the curing temperature of a general polyimide resin composition needs a high temperature of 250°C or more). When the curing reactivity deteriorates as described above, the heat resistance and adhesiveness lead to a result which is not good. In addition, it can be confirmed that in Comparative Examples 2 to 4 in which a resin composition obtained by simply mixing rubber with an epoxy resin was used, heat resistance, insulation properties, and adhesiveness deteriorated more than those of the resin compositions (Examples 1 to 6) of the present disclosure.
