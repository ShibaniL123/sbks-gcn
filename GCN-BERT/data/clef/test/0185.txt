EXAMPLE 158
N-[(S)-2-(5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-{2-[4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-2,6-dioxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-propyl]-propionamide (reaction scheme No. 3, compound 158)
156 Î¼L (1.8 mmol) of propanoyl chloride is added to a solution of 1 g (1.6 mmol) of 3-((S)-2-amino-1-methylethyl)-5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-1-{2-[4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-1H-pyrimidine-2,4-dione prepared as described in example 119 and 0.25 mL (1.8 mmol) of triethylamine in 20 mL of dichloromethane. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 h, hydrolysed and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phases are combined, washed once with water and then dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The crude product obtained is purified by silica gel chromatography eluted with a dichloromethane/methanol mixture 96/4. 0.7 g (64%) of N-[(S)-2-(5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-{2-[4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-2,6-dioxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-propyl]-propionamide is obtained in the form of a white solid.
