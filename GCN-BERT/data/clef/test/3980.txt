COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR TOPICAL DELIVERY OF PROSTAGLANDINS TO SUBCUTANEOUS FAT Related Applications [0001] This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to U.S. provisional patent application, U.S.S.N. 61/822,139, filed May 10, 2013, the entire contents of which is incorporated herein by reference. Field of the Invention [0002] The present invention relates to methods and compositions for topically delivering a therapeutically effective amount of a prostaglandin FP receptor agonist (a PFPRA compound) to adipose tissue under the skin. The therapeutic effect is, for example, reduction of excess fat under the skin, for example, the skin of the face, eyelids, neck, chin, submental region, limbs, breast, abdomen, hips, etc. More specifically, the invention relates to new compositions comprising a PFPRA compound and a fatty acid ester (e.g., isopropyl myristate), optionally further comprising an ointment base such as a hydrocarbon base (e.g., petroleum jelly), and/or optionally further comprising an organic alcohol (e.g., propylene glycol). The invention further relates to methods comprising applying the aforementioned composition(s) to the skin. The invention further relates to processes for manufacturing the aforementioned composition(s). [0003] Experimentally, in comparison to a wide array of other compositions tested, the compositions disclosed herein demonstrate exceptional and surprising efficiency in delivering certain PFPRA compounds across skin in vitro, in delivering a therapeutically effective amount to fat below the skin in vivo, and/or in reducing subcutaneous fat in vivo. In theory, this surprising efficiency may owe to the similar structure and polarity between the PFPRA compound (e.g., latanoprost) and the fatty acid ester (e.g., isopropyl myristate), as described herein. The compositions are non-irritating, well-tolerated, and aesthetically pleasing. As a further advantage, they are considered suitable for application to the face, the eyelid, and/or periorbital skin. Furthermore, the compositions are stable and can be readily manufactured, where necessary in sterile form. Background of the Invention [0004] Excess body fat is an important cause of human disease, disability, and cosmetic disturbance. For many people excess body fat is also a source of psychosocial distress and reduced self-esteem. [0005] Excess body fat may be diffuse or concentrated on particular portion(s) of the body. Of particular importance is excess body fat of the face, for example, of the eyelids, chin, or jowls. Other important sites of excess body fat can include, for example, the arms, abdomen, buttocks, hips, chest, thighs, and neck. Excess body fat can also involve excessive breast tissue on a woman or on a man, i.e., gynecomastia. Excess body fat can be located within or near the eyelids, and topical treatment of such fat requires a composition that is safe for application near the eyes, i.e. an ophthalmic and/or ophthalmically compatible formulation. Local accumulations of body fat may result from constitutional factors, disease, hormonal status, or as side effects of medication or other substances. Even in the absence of disease, cosmetic considerations apply to individuals who nevertheless perceive an excess of fat and wish to have it corrected. For example, excess submental fat, commonly known as “double chin,” is not considered a disease; however, people with excess submental fat often appear less attractive and less youthful, and can have lower self-esteem as a result. Likewise, an individual may have excess subcutaneous fat on the anterior abdomen, excess subcutaneous fat on the oblique abdomen, e.g. above the iliac crests (“love handles”), excess chest fat, excess breast fat, excess buttocks fat, excess hip fat, excess thigh fat, excess leg fat, excess upper arm fat, excess check fat, excess neck fat, etc. [0006] A number of medical conditions are considered to be causes of excess body fat. Examples include drug-induced obesity, hypothyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypothalamic obesity, polycystic ovarian disease, depression, binge eating, Prader-Willi syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Cohen syndrome, Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, growth hormone deficiency, growth hormone resistance, and leptin deficiency or resistance. Disfiguring excess regional fat deposits, for example excess dorsocervical fat, may be found in conditions such as HIV lipodystrophy, Cushing syndrome and pseudo-Cushing syndrome {i.e., characteristic syndrome of excess body fat and other findings due to excessive endogenous or exogenous corticosteroid levels), other acquired lipodystrophies, familial lipodystrophies, lipoma, lipomatosis, and Madelung disease. [0007] Medications known to cause excess body fat include cortisol and analogs, other corticosteroids, megace, sulfonylureas, antiretrovirals, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, oral contraceptives, insulin, risperidone, clozapine, and thiazolidinediones. [0008] Changes in hormonal status, including physiologic changes such as pregnancy or menopause, may result in excess body fat in a subject. Smoking cessation commonly leads to weight gain and excess body fat. Trauma may favor the accumulation of excess body fat by virtue of immobility or disuse of an extremity. Similar problems may affect a subject who is immobilized, for example due to an injury. Some tumors, for example lipomas and liposarcomas, are characterized by local collections of fat cells. Lipomatosis is any condition characterized by the formation of multiple lipomas on the body, e.g., familial multiple lipomatosis, adiposis dolorosis (Dercum’s disease), pelvic lipomatosis, etc. [0009] Even in the absence of underlying pathology, an individual may have cosmetic concerns about local or diffuse deposits of body fat. These can usually be attributed to constitutional or hereditary factors, developmental history, age, gender, diet, alcohol use, or other components of lifestyle. Individuals in such circumstances commonly wish to reduce the amount of fat on the face, eyelids, chin, arms, neck, abdomen, chest, breast, buttocks, hips, thighs, and/or legs. In some cases a local excess of fat can be due to fat prolapse, displacement, and/or migration, as in age-related orbital fat prolapse or descent of malar fat pads. Grave’s ophthalmopathy (thyroid-releated eye disease) is a condition that can be treated by reducing the volume of orbital fat. [0010] A number of methods have been developed to reduce or remove excess body fat. It is helpful to classify these methods as extractive, metabolic, or adipolytic. Extractive methods, such as lipoplasty (e.g., liposuction) or local excision, are methods whereby fat is physically removed from areas of interest. Such methods are costly and may involve scars, postsurgical deformity or regression, discomfort, infection, and other adverse reactions. [0011] In contrast to extractive methods, metabolic methods, which include systemic medications, nutritional supplements, devices, and exercise or other body treatment, seek to modify the subject’s metabolism (e.g., whether caloric consumption, expenditure, or both) such that the subject incurs a net loss of fat. A disadvantage is that these methods typically cannot be directed to a particular part of the body. Another drawback is potential concomitant loss of water, carbohydrates, protein, vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. Furthermore, traditional diet medications may have undesired side effects, for example palpitations, tremor, insomnia, and/or irritability in a subject who uses stimulants as appetite suppressants. Despite salubrious value, the traditional metabolic methods of diet and exercise are not practical for everybody. [0012] Adipolytic methods aim to cause breakdown of adipocytes and/or their lipid contents. For example, fat deposits can be reduced by exposure to cold temperature or to deoxycholate, a solubilizer that lyses cell membranes and results in local necrosis. Drawbacks of these methods can include poor discrimination between adipose and other nearby tissues, barriers to delivery that require hypodermic needles or special equipment, and adverse effects such as necrosis, inflammation, and pain. [0013] Compounds of the prostaglandin FP receptor agonist (PFPRA compound) class, e.g., latanoprost and tafluprost, can be administered to the skin to locally reduce adipose tissue under the skin, ℓ℮., subcutaneous fat. See, e.g., U.S. Patent 8,426,471 and U.S. Publication No. 2010/0234466, incorporated herein by reference. Developing topical delivery of the PFPRA compound poses significant challenges, since delivery to subcutaneous fat comprises delivery across the stratum comeum, epidermis, dermis, and dermal microcirculation, and into the fat below. [0014] For example, the skin, in particular the stratum corneum, presents a formidable physical barrier to drug penetration. See, e.g., Dayan Ν, Delivery System Design in Topically Applied Formulations: An Overview, in Rosen Μ, Delivery System Handbook for Personal Care and Cosmetic Products, William Andrew, 2005, ρρ. 103-104. For any particular drug, the formulation must be selected empirically. The formulation must be physically and chemically compatible with the drug. [0015] Furthermore, provided that a formulation enables a drug to cross the skin, to reach the subcutaneous fat it must also circumvent what is known as the “sink condition” of the dermal circulation. See, e.g., Dayan Ν, Delivery System Design in Topically Applied Formulations: An Overview, in Rosen Μ, Delivery System Handbook for Personal Care and Cosmetic Products, William Andrew, 2005, ρρ. 103-104; Kao J, In Vitro Assessment of Dermal Absorption, in Hobson DW, Dermal and Ocular Toxicology: Fundamentals and Methods, CRC Press, 1991, ρρ. 272-273. Because the dermis is invested by a network of capillaries with rapid blood flow, for any solute {e.g., drug) that penetrates the dermis, a wide concentration gradient is created between the skin and bloodstream. Thus, there is a strong tendency for drugs that penetrate into the dermis to diffuse rapidly down this gradient into the bloodstream. This sink phenomenon favors systemic delivery {e.g., to the bloodstream, as with a nicotine patch), but undermines attempts at local delivery {e.g., to subcutaneous fat, as in the present invention). No method of reasoning or prediction is available in the art to suggest which formulations, if any, can circumvent the sink condition. Therefore, the artisan must search for such formulations empirically, and without prior knowledge that such formulation even exists. [0016] The formulation must also have a favorable systemic drug exposure profile, e.g., that avoids excessive levels of drug in the bloodstream. This requirement is rendered more difficult by the sink condition. [0017] Additionally, the formulation should deliver the active ingredient with reasonable efficiency. One measure of efficiency is the ability to minimize the concentration of active ingredient in the finished product and still maintain the desired therapeutic effect. This has implications for manufacturability, cost of goods, and local safety and tolerability. Another measure of efficiency is the ability to minimize the dose frequency and still maintain the desired therapeutic effect, which has implications for patient convenience and product marketability. [0018] As well, the formulation must cause little or no skin irritation. If applied to skin near the eye, e.g., the eyelid, the formulation is considered an ophthalmic formulation. Generally, an ophthalmic formulation must be sterile, e.g., according to Chapter <71> of the U.S. Pharmacopeia. Preferably, an ophthalmic formulation must also be free or essentially free of bacterial endotoxin, e.g. according to Chapter <85> of the U.S. Pharmacopeia, e.g., an endotoxin level of <10 EU (endotoxin units) per gram of composition. If applied to skin near the eye, the formulation must be ophthalmically compatible, i.e, the formulation must not cause clinically significant eye irritation, and must not be toxic to the eye, e.g., the ocular surface, e.g. the cornea. Irritation potential and ocular toxicity are studied empirically by standard preclinical models, or in human trials. Although the skin or eye irritation potential of individual inactive ingredients is generally known, combinations of inactive and active ingredients can cause unexpected irritation, which must be tested empirically. [0019] Furthermore, the formulation must possess other qualities necessary to make a topical formulation and market it to consumers: ease of manufacture, physical and chemical stability, and commercially acceptable appearance, odor, and tactile qualities. [0020] Therefore, there is a need for new compositions for topically delivering a PFPRA compound to adipose tissue under the skin. Summary of the Invention [0021] It has now been discovered experimentally that certain topical compositions comprising a PFPRA compound (e.g., latanoprost or tafluprost) and certain fatty acid esters (e.g., isopropyl myristate) provide exceptionally efficient delivery of the compound and its active metabolite into subcutaneous fat, and thus have particular uses and advantages, as described herein. In theory, this efficiency may owe to the similar structure and polarity between the PFPRA compound (e.g., latanoprost or tafluprost) and the fatty acid ester (e.g., isopropyl myristate), as described herein. [0022] Thus, in one aspect, provided is a composition useful in the reduction of subcutaneous fat comprising a PFPRA compound, e.g. latanoprost or tafluprost, and a fatty acid ester, e.g., isopropyl myristate. In certain embodiments, the concentration of the PFPRA compound in the composition is between about 0.0001 percent to about 1 percent by weight, as a proportion of the total weight of the composition, e.g., between about 0.05 percent and about 0.5 percent by weight, or between about 0.01 percent and about 0.1 percent by weight of the final composition. In some embodiments, the final concentration of the fatty acid ester {e.g., isopropyl myristate) is between about 1 percent to about 20 percent by weight, e.g., between about 1 percent and about 10 percent by weight of the composition. In certain embodiments, the composition further comprises an ointment base, e.g., a hydrocarbon base such as petroleum jelly. In some embodiments, the final concentration of the ointment base is between about 50 percent and about 99 percent by weight, e.g., between about 70 percent and about 99 percent by weight, of the total weight of the composition. In some embodiments, the composition further comprises an organic alcohol {e.g., propylene glycol). In some embodiments, the final concentration of the organic alcohol is between about 5 percent and about 50 percent by weight, e.g., between about 5 percent and about 20 percent by weight, of the total weight of the composition. In some embodiments, the composition is not an emulsion. In some embodiments, the composition is immiscible in water. In some embodiments, the composition is an ophthalmic composition and is ophthalmically compatible. In some embodiments, the composition is sterile. [0023] In another aspect, provided is a method of reducing body fat in a subject, comprising topically administering a composition as described herein to a subject in need thereof. In certain embodiments, the method is a therapeutic method. In other embodiments, the method is a cosmetic method.

In another aspect, provided is use of a composition as described herein in the manufacture of a medicament for reducing body fat in a subject. [0025] In another aspect, provided is a composition for use in for reducing fat in a subject suffering from steatoblepharon. In another aspect, provided is a method of treating steatoblepharon in a subject, comprising topically administering {e.g., applying to an eyelid of the subject) a composition as described herein to a subject in need thereof. In another aspect, provided is a composition as described herein for use in a method of treating steatoblepharon in a subject. In another aspect, provided is use a composition as described herein in the manufacture of a medicament for treating steatoblepharon in a subject. [0026] In yet another aspect, provided is a kit comprising a composition as described herein and instructions for use. [0027] In another aspect, provided is a process for manufacturing one or more of the inventive compositions in a sterile fashion, whereby the composition is sterile, endotoxin-free, and ophthalmically compatible, and therefore suitable for use on the eyelid or near the eye. For example, in one embodiment, provided is a process for manufacturing a sterile ointment, comprising the steps of dissolving a PFPRA compound (e.g. latanoprost or tafluprost) in a fatty acid ester {e.g., isopropyl myristate) to make a solution; microfiltration of the solution to make a filtrate; and combining the filtrate with an ointment base {e.g., a hydrocarbon base such as petroleum jelly). In certain embodiments, the method further comprises dissolving a preservative (e.g., chlorobutanol) in the fatty acid ester {e.g., isopropyl myristate).

Definitions Chemical definitions [0030] Definitions of specific functional groups and chemical terms are described in more detail below. The chemical elements are identified in accordance with the Periodic Table of the Elements, CAS version, Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 75th Ed., inside cover, and specific functional groups are generally defined as described therein. Additionally, general principles of organic chemistry, as well as specific functional moieties and reactivity, are described in Organic Chemistry, Thomas Sorrell, University Science Books, Sausalito, 1999; Smith and March March’s Advanced Organic Chemistry, 5th Edition, John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York, 2001; Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers, Inc., New York, 1989; and Carruthers, Some Modem Methods of Organic Synthesis, 3rd Edition, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1987. [0031] Certain compounds as described herein can comprise one or more asymmetric centers, and thus can exist in various isomeric forms, e.g., enantiomers and/or diastereomers. The compounds provided herein can be in the form of an individual enantiomer, diastereomer or geometric isomer, or can be in the form of a mixture of stereoisomers, including racemic mixtures and mixtures enriched in one or more stereoisomer. In certain embodiments, the compounds as described herein are enantiopure compounds. In certain other embodiments, mixtures of stereoisomers are provided. [0032] Furthermore, certain compounds, as described herein may have one or more double bonds that can exist as either the cis or Irons, or the Ε or Ζ isomer, unless otherwise indicated. The invention additionally encompasses the compounds as individual isomers substantially free of other isomers, and alternatively, as mixtures of various isomers, e.g., racemic mixtures of Ε/Ζ isomers or mixtures enriched in one Ε/Ζ isomer. [0033] The terms “enantiomerically enriched,” “enantiomerically pure” and “non-racemic,” as used interchangeably herein, refer to compositions in which the percent by weight of one enantiomer is greater than the amount of that one enantiomer in a control mixture of the racemic composition (e.g., greater than 1:1 by weight). For example, an enantiomerically enriched preparation of the (S)-enantiomer, means a preparation of the compound having greater than 50% by weight of the (S)-enantiomer relative to the (R)enantiomer, more preferably at least 75% by weight, and even more preferably at least 80% by weight. In some embodiments, the enrichment can be much greater than 80% by weight, providing a “substantially enantiomerically enriched,” “substantially enantiomerically pure” or a “substantially non-racemic” preparation, which refers to preparations of compositions which have at least 85% by weight of one enantiomer relative to other enantiomer, more preferably at least 90% by weight, and even more preferably at least 95% by weight. In preferred embodiments, the enantiomerically enriched composition has a higher potency with respect to therapeutic utility per unit mass than does the racemic mixture of that composition. Enantiomers can be isolated from mixtures by methods known to those skilled in the art, including chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the formation and crystallization of chiral salts; or preferred enantiomers can be prepared by asymmetric syntheses. See, for example, Jacques, et al., Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions (Wiley Interscience, New York, 1981); Wilen, S.H., et al., Tetrahedron 33:2725 (1977); Eliel, E.L. Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds (McGraw-Hill, NY, 1962); and Wilen, S.H. Tables of Resolving Agents and Optical Resolutions ρ. 268 (E.L.

Wuts, 3rd edition, John Wiley & Sons, 1999, incorporated herein by reference. [0080] These and other exemplary substituents are described in more detail in the Detailed Description, the Examples and in the Claims. The invention is not intended to be limited in any manner by the above exemplary listing of substituents. [0081] As used herein, the terms “salt”, “acceptable salt”, or “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, Berge et αℓ., describes pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in./. Pharmaceutical Sciences (1977) 66:1-19. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include those derived from suitable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate, glycerophosphate, gluconate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like. Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium and N+(Ci^alkyl)4 salts. Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, lower alkyl sulfonate and aryl sulfonate. [0082] As used herein, the term “prodrug” means a compound that can hydrolyze, oxidize, or otherwise react under biological conditions (e.g., in vitro or in vivo enzymatic conditions) to provide a pharmacologically active compound. In certain cases, a prodrug has improved physical and/or delivery properties over the parent compound. Prodrugs are typically designed to enhance pharmacologically, pharmaceutically and/or pharmacokinetically based properties associated with the parent compound. The advantage of a prodrug can lie in its physical properties, such as enhanced water solubility for parenteral administration at physiological pH compared to the parent compound, or it enhances absorption from the digestive tract, or it may enhance drug stability for long-term storage. Other definitions [0083] “Disease”, “disorder,” and “condition” are used interchangeably herein. [0084] As used herein, an “individual” or “subject” to which administration is contemplated includes, but is not limited to, humans (ℓ℮., a male or female of any age group, e.g., a pediatric subject (e.g., child, adolescent) or adult subject (e.g., young adult, middleaged adult or senior adult)), other primates (e.g., cynomolgus monkeys, rhesus monkeys) and commercially relevant mammals such as cattle, pigs, horses, sheep, goats, cats, and/or dogs. In any aspect and/or embodiment of the invention, the mammal is a human. [0085] As used herein, “local administration” or “administering locally” or “local effect” means administration/application of the active ingredient or active metabolite thereof directly, or in proximity to, a part of the body, tissue, or lesion where said active substance is intended to exert its action. This may include, for example, topical administration to a part of the skin. [0086] As used herein, unless otherwise specified, “topical administration” or “topically” means application to the surface of the skin, e.g., in a non-invasive manner. [0087] As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, a “therapeutically effective amount” “an amount sufficient” or “sufficient amount” of a compound means the level, amount or concentration of the compound needed to treat a disease, disorder or condition, or to reduce or lower a particular parameter (e.g., body fat) in the body of a subject, without causing significant negative or adverse side effects to body or the treated tissue. The term “therapeutically effective amount” can encompass an amount that improves overall therapy, reduces or avoids symptoms or causes of disease or condition, or enhances the therapeutic efficacy of another therapeutically active agent. [0088] As used herein, the terms “reduce”, “reduction”, “reducing”, “lower”, or “lowering” means to diminish or lessen the volume, size, mass, bulk, density, amount, and/or quantity of a substance (e.g., body fat, adipose tissue) in the body of a subject. [0089] As used herein, the term “eliminate” means to completely remove any unwanted or undesired volume, size, mass, bulk, density, amount, and/or quantity of a substance (e.g., excess body fat, excess adipose tissue) in the body of a subject. [0090] As used herein, “suffer”, “suffers” or “suffering from” refers to a subject diagnosed with a particular disease or condition. As used herein, “likely to suffer” refers to a subject who has not been diagnosed with a particular disease or condition by a medical practitioner, but has a predisposition (e.g., genetic and/or physiologic predisposition), or exhibits signs or symptoms of the disease or condition. [0091] As used herein, and unless otherwise specified, the terms “treat,” “treating” and “treatment” contemplate an action that occurs while a subject is suffering from the specified disease or condition, which reduces the severity of the disease or condition, or retards or slows the progression of the disease or condition. [0092] As used herein, unless otherwise specified, the terms “prevent,” “preventing” and “prevention” contemplate an action that occurs before a subject begins to suffer from the specified disease or condition, which inhibits or reduces the severity of the disease or condition. [0093] Conditions for which treatment and prevention are contemplated may be further classified as a medical condition or a cosmetic condition. A “medical condition,” as used herein, refers to an abnormal condition that affects the body. A “cosmetic condition,” as used herein, refers to a condition other than a medical condition that affects the physical appearance of the body. A cosmetic condition can occur, for example, due to normal processes in a body, such as aging, pregnancy, puberty, and exposure to the sun or the elements, or due to normal features of a body, such as inherited facial features or body shapes that are found in healthy individuals. Various medical and cosmetic conditions are described herein. A “cosmetic method” refers to a method or procedure intended to ameliorate a cosmetic condition in the subject, e.g., for the beautification of the subject’s body or a part thereof, and a “cosmetic composition” is contemplated useful for such purpose. A “therapeutic method” refers to a method or procedure intended to treat or prevent a medical condition, and a “pharmaceutical composition” is contemplated useful for such purpose. However, while pharmaceutical compositions are contemplated useful for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes, and cosmetic compositions are contemplated useful for cosmetic purposes, there is overlap between the two compositions in terms of use of the composition. For example, a pharmaceutical composition is also contemplated useful for beautification purposes. [0094] As used herein, unless otherwise specified, “excess submental fat” means excess fat on the body region including the mentum, the underside of the jaw, and the anterior neck, for example to the level of the inferior border of the cricoid. [0095] As used herein, unless otherwise specified, “steatoblepharon” refers to a condition characterized by excess fat of the eyelids and/or periorbital tissue. The excess fat can be due to prolapse of orbital or periorbital fat. Steatoblepharon can occur in the lower or upper eyelid, or both. Steatoblepharon can be considered a cause of “eye bags.” [0096] The presence, amount, or severity of excess fat can be assessed objectively, e.g., by magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, biopsy, or skin calipers, or subjectively, e.g., by a clinician, a patient, or other observer, optionally with reference to a photonumeric, verbal, or descriptive scale or classification system, e.g., a five-step severity scale. Detailed Description of Certain Embodiments of the Invention [0097] The present invention relates to new, stable, manufacturable, well-tolerated, aesthetically pleasing compositions that, when topically applied to the skin, delivers a therapeutically effective amount of a prostaglandin FP receptor agonist (PFPRA compound), e.g., a prostaglandin F2a analog, e.g., latanoprost or tafluprost, to subcutaneous fat. More specifically, the invention relates to compositions for delivery of a PFPRA compound to subcutaneous fat comprising a PFPRA compound and a fatty acid ester, e.g., isopropyl myristate. The formulations are useful for local reduction of subcutaneous fat, and for other therapeutic uses as described herein. The invention also relates to methods for locally reducing body fat, comprising administering the inventive compositions to the skin. The invention also related to a process for manufacturing one or more of the inventive compositions, e.g., in a sterile fashion, whereby the composition is sterile, endotoxin-free, and ophthalmically compatible, and therefore suitable for use on the eyelid or near the eye. A particular advantage of the inventive formulations is suitability for application on the face and/or periorbital skin. [0098] As described herein, no theoretical framework was available to the inventors to select or improve a composition for delivering a PFPRA compound to subcutaneous fat. Rather, the inventors found it necessary to test a wide range of conditions both in vitro and in vivo, with different formulation components at different concentrations and in different combinations. This testing led to the discovery that inclusion of a fatty acid ester {e.g., isopropyl myristate) in the composition conferred exceptionally better performance for delivery of a PFPRA compound and reduction of subcutaneous fat compared to, for example, use of 1,3-butanediol, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, dimethylsulfoxide, ethanol, glycerol monooleate, hydroxypropyl cellulose, lauryl lactate, methyl laurate, oleyl alcohol, polysorbate 80, propylene glycol, and combinations thereof. [0099] Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the special properties conferred by combining a fatty acid ester (e.g., isopropyl myristate) and a PFPRA may owe to certain similarities between the fatty acid ester (e.g., isopropyl myristate) and PFPRA compounds, i.e., similar structure and similar polarity. For example, latanoprost (cfi Examples 1-3) and isopropyl myristate are both isopropyl esters with parent acids comprising aliphatic tails of similar chain length (isopropyl myristate, 13 aliphatic carbons in the lipid tail; latanoprost 13 aliphatic carbons if the cyclizing carbons 9 through 11 of the cyclopentyl ring are not counted). As shown in Figure 1, in their energy-minimized 3-dimensional conformations, both compounds are roughly linear and of similar length. Furthermore, according to this structural hypothesis, latanoprost per se could serve as a penetration enhancer in this context, in that the 5-cis double bond of latanoprost (likewise present in most other PFPRA compounds) may lend particular improvement to the penetration characteristics of isopropyl myristate, as the structural kink of unsaturated molecules is known to interfere with close packing of the phospholipid bilayer and can thereby improve penetration. [00100] In some embodiments, the composition comprises a PFPRA compound with a 5-cis double bond. In some embodiments, the composition comprises a PRPRA compound ester and a fatty acid ester, wherein both esters comprise the same ether (-ORFA1) moiety. In some embodiments, the composition comprises a PRPRA compound ester and a fatty acid ester, wherein both esters comprise aliphatic tails (RFA2) of similar chain length. [00101] In some embodiments, the composition comprises isopropyl myristate. In some embodiments, the composition comprises isopropyl myristate and one or more additional different fatty acid esters, e.g., of the below formula, wherein the ether moiety of the ester (Rfa1) is optionally substituted C1-C6 alkyl, and the aliphatic moiety of the ester (RFA2) is optionally substituted C10-C20 alkyl or optionally substituted C10-C20 alkenyl, and wherein the additional different fatty acid ester is not isopropyl myristate. It is understood that, according to the above theory, a different fatty acid ester may be used in the composition other than isopropyl myristate, e.g., such that the composition comprises a fatty acid ester of the below formula, wherein the ether moiety of the ester (RFA1) is optionally substituted Q-Ce alkyl, and the aliphatic moiety of the ester (RFA2) is optionally substituted C10-C20 alkyl or optionally substituted C10-C20 alkenyl, provided the composition does not comprise isopropyl myristate. Alternatively, in some embodiments, isopropyl myristate cannot be replaced with a different fatty acid ester. In some embodiments, the composition comprises isopropyl myristate and does not comprise one or more additional different fatty acid esters. 0 RFA2 '0' X,RFA1 isopropyl myristate [00102] In certain embodiments, RFA1 is an optionally substituted C| 3alkyl, Ci^alkyl, Ci_3alkyl, C, 2alkyl, C2 6alkyl.

In certain embodiments, RFA2 is a substituted alkenyl group, e.g., substituted by halogen atoms. In certain embodiments, RFA2 is an alkenyl group comprising 1, 2, 3, or 4 double bonds, each independently cis or Irons. [00105] In certain embodiments, RFA2 is selected from any one of the following saturated or unsaturated fatty acyl moieties: Laurie -(CH2)10CH3, Myristic -(CH2)12CH3, Palmitic -(CH2)14CH3, Stearic -(CH2)16CH3, Myristoleic -(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)3CH3, Palmitoliec -(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)5CH3, Sapienic -(CH2)4CH=CH(CH2)8CH3, Oleic -(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7CH3, Linoleic -(CH2)7CH=CHCH2CH=CH(CH2)4CH3, a-Linolenic -(CH2)7CH=CHCH2CH=CHCH2CH=CHCH2CH [00106] In certain embodiments, the total number of carbons atoms in the fatty acid ester, which include the number of carbons of R and R is between 15 and 19, inclusive, i.e., 15, 16, 17, 18, or 19 carbon atoms total. [00107] In some embodiments, the total number of carbons in the fatty acid ester is selected to approximate the aliphatic chain length of the PFPRA compound. For example, in certain embodiments, the PRPRA compound has the same number of total carbon atoms in the sum of the aliphatic chain and ester moiety of the PFPRA compound, i.e., 15, 16, 17, 18, or 19 carbon atoms total. [00108] In some embodiments, fatty acid ester is selected such that its predicted length (e.g. by molecular modeling) is similar (e.g., within ±3 A) to the predicted length of the PFPRA compound. For example, isopropyl myristate has a predicted length (between the two most distant heavy atoms) of about 20 A, which compares favorably with a length of about 18 A for latanoprost and tafluprost, about 19 A for bimatoprost, and about 20 A for travoprost. In some embodiments, the predicted length is in an energy-minimized conformation. In some embodiments, the predicted length is of a conformation whereby freely rotating bonds are rotated as to provide a maximal length. [00109] In certain embodiments, the composition further comprises an ointment base. As used herein, an ointment is a homogeneous, viscous, semi-solid preparation, which comprises a greasy, ointment base having a medium-to-high viscosity, that is intended for topical application to the skin. Exemplary ointment bases include, but are not limited to, hydrocarbon bases/waxes (e.g., plant and animal waxes (e.g., beeswax, lanolin, camauba wax), petroleum derived waxes (e.g., hard paraffin wax or soft paraffin wax, i.e., petroleum jelly), microcyrstalline wax, ceresine wax, white wax, yellow wax, and cetyl esters wax). In certain embodiments, the ointment base is a hydrocarbon base, e.g., soft paraffin wax, e.g., petroleum jelly. Petroleum jelly (also known as petrolatum, white petrolatum, soft paraffin or multi-hydrocarbon) is a semi-solid preparation typically comprising (or consisting of) one or more saturated hydrocarbons with carbon numbers mainly higher than 25 (typically 25 to 50, such as 25 to 40, such as 25 to 35). It typically has a boiling point of from about 250°C to about 350°C, such as about 280°C to about 320°C, preferably about about 300°C, and a melting point typically from about 36°C to about 60°C. In certain embodiments, the petroleum jelly is obtained in sterile form or is sterilized prior to manufacturing the composition. In certain embodiments, the petroleum jelly is pure ultra white petroleum jelly. [00110] In some embodiments, the composition further comprises an organic alcohol, e.g., methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, 1,3-butanediol, ethylene glycol, or propylene glycol. In certain embodiments, the organic alcohol is propylene glycol. However, in certain embodiments, 1,3-butanediol is excluded. [00111] In clinical practice, topical delivery of compounds across the skin usually relies on the principle of passive diffusion. This principle dictates that a compound can only flow from an area of higher thermodynamic potential to one of lower thermodynamic potential. A solute held firmly by a vehicle will demonstrate little or no diffusion. Thus, the skilled artisan expects that a PFPRA compound (which is an oil-soluble compound) will penetrate better from an aqueous vehicle than from an oily vehicle (See, e.g., Barrett CW, Skin penetration. J. Soc. Cosmetic Chemists 1969;20:487-499). Thus far, this theory has been borne out in practice, as PFPRA compound formulations for topical use have repeatedly selected water or ethanol as the preferred carrier for clinical use. See, e.g., prescribing inserts for Xalatan®, Travatan®, Fumigan®, and Zioptan®. See also Blume-Peytavi U et al, A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study to assess the efficacy of a 24-week topical treatment by latanoprost 0.1% on hair growth and pigmentation in healthy volunteers with androgenetic alopecia, J Am Acad Dermatol 2012;66:794-800. Thus, another surprising aspect of the invention is that compositions comprising PFPRA compound formulated with a fatty acid ester (e.g., isopropyl myristate) and an ointment base, e.g., a hydrocarbon base such as petroleum jelly, delivers the PFPRA compound more effectively than an array of other vehicles, as disclosed herein. In certain embodiments, the composition does not include an aqueous or water-soluble component such as an organic alcohol. However, in certain embodiments, the composition does comprise an organic alcohol, e.g., propylene glycol, and, in certain embodiments, the composition comprises the organic alcohol in no greater than 50% by weight. In certain embodiments, the composition is hydrophobic, e.g., the composition is not miscible in water. In certain embodiments, the composition is not an emulsion. In certain embodiments, the composition does not contain mineral oil. PFPRA compounds [00112] As used herein, a “PFPRA compound” can be any therapeutically relevant, naturally occurring or synthetic prostaglandin or prostaglandin analog, provided that it or its active metabolite {e.g., if an ester, the parent acid) suitably agonizes a prostaglandin FP receptor in a suitable functional assay. As used herein, a suitable degree of agonism can be defined, for example, as a half maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 1 micromolar or less, preferably 100 nanomolar or less. A suitable functional assay can be, for example, assessment of phosphoinositide turnover in ΗΕΚ293 cells expressing a cloned FP prostaglandin receptor. See, e.g., Sharif et αℓ., J. Ocular Pharmacol. Ther. 2002;18:313-324. Many PFPRA compounds can be classified as prostaglandins, prostanoids, or prostamides. Naturally occurring prostaglandins are a class of structurally related eicosanoid hormones that are derived enzymatically from arachidonic acid. An example of a naturally occurring prostaglandin PFPRA compound is prostaglandin F2a. Exemplary synthetic prostaglandins, which are prostaglandin F2a analogs, include, but are not limited to, latanoprost, latanoprost free acid, bimatoprost, bimatoprost free acid, tafluprost, tafluprost free acid, travoprost, travoprost free acid (a.k.a. fluprostenol), and prodrugs (e.g., 9-, 11-, and/or 15-ester derivatives) thereof.

[00287] As described herein, the route of administering is topical. In certain embodiments, the administering is to a body part selected from the group consisting of the face, chin, submental region, jowls, cheeks, periorbital skin, neck, arms, abdomen, chest, breast, buttocks, hips, thighs, legs, and knees. [00288] In certain embodiments, the subject has excess body fat as a side effect of medication (e.g., for example, cortisol and analogs, corticosteroids, megace, sulfonylureas, anti-retrovirals, antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, oral contraceptives, insulin or a form of insulin, risperidone, clozapine, and thiazolidinediones). [00289] In certain embodiments, the subject has excess body fat due to changes in hormonal status (e.g., as a result of physiologic changes such as pregnancy or menopause). [00290] In certain embodiments, the subject with excess body fat is undergoing or has recently undergone smoking cessation. [00291] In certain embodiments, the subject has body fat of cosmetic significance, for example, due to age-related orbital fat prolapse, excess submental fat, or descent of the malar fat pads. [00292] This aspect of invention may also be useful as an adjunct to any of various kinds of surgery and/or non-invasive therapy, whether used in the pre-operative, perioperative, or post-operative period. The invention further contemplates uses preceding abdominal, thoracic, oncologic, endocrine, neurologic, transplant, and dermatologic surgery, whereby surgical exposure may be improved; preceding or following orthopedic procedures, whereby surgical exposure as well as post-operative recovery may be improved; and preceding cosmetic procedures using lasers, another type of radiation, thermal therapy, cryotherapy, ultrasound, electrolysis, chemical treatment and the like, e.g., skin tightening, skin resurfacing, collagen remodeling, and the like. Process for manufacturing a sterile ointment [00293] For ophthalmic use, e.g., application on the eyelid for reduction of steatoblepharon, a sterile composition is preferred. Certain of the inventive formulations {e.g., a composition comprising latanoprost, isopropyl myristate, and petrolatum) are not compatible with all forms of sterilization. For example, the inventors found that gamma irradiation caused degradation of latanoprost (Example 14). Petroleum jelly is incompatible with autoclave sterilization and poorly suited for microfiltration. [00294] The inventors sought a practicable alternative. Having discovered that latanoprost is exceptionally soluble in isopropyl myristate (Example 3), the inventors developed a manufacturing process (cf. Example 4) comprising the steps of: (1) dissolving the PFPRA {e.g., latanoprost) and optionally other components {e.g., chlorobutanol) in the fatty acid ester {e.g., isopropyl myristate) to make a solution; (2) microfiltration of the solution {e.g., under aseptic conditions) to make a sterile filtrate; and (3) addition of the filtrate to sterile petroleum jelly, which is optionally liquefied, e.g., by heating {e.g., from about 40° C to about 70°C, e.g., about 50 to about 60° C); and (4) mixing to obtain a uniform mixture. Upon reading the Examples, the skilled artisan can appreciate several advantages to combining the latanoprost and PFPRA compound prior to microfiltration, as opposed to filtering these components separately: latanoprost is very viscous and poorly suited to microfiltration; the volume of latanoprost is generally small and therefore prone to measurement error {i.e., imprecision) and losses in the so-called “dead space” of the microfilter; and diluting the latanoprost in the isopropyl myristate promotes uniformity of the latanoprost in the final composition. However, the skilled artisan will also appreciate that the strategy of dissolving the latanoprost in the isopropyl myristate would not be practicable, except for the fortuitiously good solubility found by the inventors (Example 3). Furthermore, a surprising and advantageous property of mixing the isopropyl myristate in the petroleum jelly is that it substantially reduces the viscosity of the mixture, as compared to that of the pure petroleum jelly. This not only facilitates mixing (thereby promoting uniformity of the mixture) but also renders the composition more flowable and spreadable on the skin, i.e., the pharmaceutical composition is easier to dispense from a container and apply to the skin. [00295] Thus, in another aspect, provided is a process for manufacturing one or more of the inventive compositions in a sterile fashion, whereby the composition is sterile, endotoxin-free, and ophthalmically compatible, and therefore suitable for use on the eyelid or near the eye. For example, in one embodiment, provided is a process for manufacturing a sterile ointment, comprising dissolving a PFPRA compound (e.g. latanoprost or tafluprost) in a fatty acid ester (e.g., isopropyl myristate) to make a solution; microfiltration of the solution to make a filtrate; and combining the filtrate with an ointment base (e.g., a hydrocarbon base such as petroleum jelly). In certain embodiments, the method further comprises dissolving a preservative (e.g., chlorobutanol) in the fatty acid ester (e.g., isopropyl myristate). Examples [00296] Throughout the description, where compositions are described as having, including, or comprising specific components, it is contemplated that these compositions may also consist essentially of, or consist of, the recited components. Further, it should be understood that the order of steps or order for performing certain actions are immaterial so long as the invention remains operable. Moreover, two or more steps or actions may be conducted simultaneously. In light of the foregoing description, the specific non-limiting examples presented below are for illustrative purposes and not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way. Example 1 [00297] A composition for local reduction of subcutaneous fat was prepared as follows: Table 1. Ingredients \nioimt Latanoprost 100 mg Isopropyl myristate 5g Propylene glycol 15 g White petroleum jelly 79.9 g [00298] Neat latanoprost was added to a mixture of propylene glycol and isopropyl myristate. To the resulting mixture was added melted petroleum jelly. The mixture was stirred thoroughly and allowed to cool, yielding about 100 grams of an ointment with a final latanoprost concentration of 0.1% (w/w). It was noted that the compared to pure petrolatum, the mixture was more flowable, more spreadable, more easily mixed (ℓ℮., requiring less force to mix), and more easily dispensed from a container, e.g., ajar or compressible tube (ℓ℮., requiring less force and flowing in a more controlled manner). Example 2 [00299] A composition for local reduction of subcutaneous fat was prepared as follows: Table 2. Ingredients \mminl per 100 g of composition Latanoprost ΐΐ.5 g Chlorobutanol, anhydrous 0.5 g Isopropyl myristate 5g White petroleum jelly 94.2 g [00300] Chlorobutanol was dissolved in isopropyl myristate, and to the resulting solution neat latanoprost was added and dissolved. To the resulting solution was added melted petroleum jelly. The mixture was stirred thoroughly and allowed to cool, yielding about 100 grams of an ointment with a final latanoprost concentration of 0.3% (w/w). Compositions were prepared according to the above formula at various scales ranging from about 50 to about 1000 g. Furthermore, comparable formulations comprising 0.1%, 0.15%, and 0.5% (w/w) were likewise prepared, with the difference in latanoprost content balanced by the amount of petroleum jelly. On HPLC analysis, these compositions were found to be uniform and to have the correct potency. Example 3 [00301] The solubility of latanoprost in a 10:1 solution of isopropyl myristate and chlorobutanol was assessed by a standard (USP) protocol at 25° C. The upper limit of solubility at this temperature was found to be about 60 to about 85 mg/g. This high degree of solubility was surprising, because latanoprost is insoluble or poorly soluble in most solvents. Furthermore, this high degree of solubility was crucial for practicing the aseptic process described in the next example. Example 4 [00302] A sterile, ophthalmically compatible composition for local reduction of fat was prepared as follows: ruble 3. Ingredients \niount Latanoprost 100 mg Chlorobutanol, anhydrous 0.5 g Isopropyl myristate 5g White petroleum jelly 94.4 g [00303] The process was carried out aseptically. Chlorobutanol (CB) was dissolved in isopropyl myristate (IM). To this solution latanoprost was added and readily dissolved. The resulting solution was filtered through a 0.2 micron filter to yield a filtrate, which was placed in a sterile vessel. To the vessel was added sterile, melted petroleum jelly. The mixture was stirred thoroughly, yielding about 100 grams of a uniform ointment with a final latanoprost concentration of 0.1% (w/w). On laboratory analysis, the ointment was sterile and free of endotoxins. A comparable ointment comprising 0.3% (w/w) was prepared, with the additional latanoprost replacing a like amount of petroleum jelly. The skilled artisan will appreciate that the above process requires latanoprost solubility in the IM:CB solution of at least 18 or 55 mg/g for the 0.1% and 0.3% products, respectively. Example 5 [00304] Compositions were prepared according to Example 2 and stored in a tightsealed container at room temperature. The latanoprost concentration, uniformity, and lack of impurities were verified by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The composition was stored and reanalyzed and tested on HPLC at regular intervals for 2 months. At each interval, organoleptic inspection showed physical stability of the composition, and HPLC shows a stable latanoprost concentration and a lack of known degradants (e.g., latanoprost free acid, 15-keto latanoprost). Thus, it was concluded that the composition demonstrates excellent physical and chemical stability. Example 6 [00305] Skin permeation studies were conducted with various formulations of latanoprost, ex vivo, on fresh human skin. Lresh human skin was obtained from live donors undergoing abdominoplasty and mounted on a standard (Lranz-type) diffusion cell apparatus. All formulations contained 0.8% of latanoprost, expressed as weight of latanoprost per total weight of the composition. Each test article (8 mg) was uniformly applied to a skin surface of 0.8 cm2. All formulations were tested on skin from at least two different donors. Treated skin was left open to the atmosphere to simulate clinical conditions. Receptor fluid flowed continuously over 24 hours and was collected in fractions. The amount of drug (latanoprost free acid) in these fractions was determined by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet detection. The following amounts of drug were recovered from receptor fluid over 24 hours: DOME = diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, DMSO = dimethylsulfoxide, IM = isopropyl myristate, LL = lauryl lactate, PG = propylene glycol, PS = polysorbate 80, WPJ = white petroleum jelly. Table 4. Vehicle ronnulnlion Drug mass dig, mean) PG 15%, IM 5%, WPJ 80% 10,808 PG 15%, PS 5%, WPJ 80% 3795 PG 7.5%, LL 7.5%, PS 5%, WPJ 80% 3635 PG 7.5%, PS 5%, WPJ 87.5% 2082 PG 15%, PS 15%, WPJ 70%, 1127 Ethanol 70%, PG 30% 3930 Ethanol 75%, DGME 25% 1260 Ethanol 75%, LL 25% 890 Ethanol 50%, LL 25%, DGME 25% 840 DMSO 99% Gel 5850 [00306] Thus, a formulation of latanoprost comprising isopropyl myristate in a hydrocarbon base provided substantially more dermal drug penetration compared to similar formulations lacking isopropyl myristate. The formulation comprising isopropyl myristate also provided superior drug penetration to a positive control, which is DMSO 99% Gel, and compared to a range of other formulations comprising enhancers such as lauryl lactate, polysorbate 80, and diethylene glycol monoethyl ether. Example 7 [00307] Skin permeation studies were conducted with various formulations of latanoprost, ex vivo, on fresh pig skin, according to methods as described in the foregoing example. All formulations contained 0.25% of latanoprost, expressed as weight of latanoprost per total weight of the composition. The following flux values for LFA were observed over 24 hours: Table 5. Vehicle l-'onmilation LF \ llu\ (ng/cnr/h) MO 15%, IM 5%, WPJ 80% 8 IM = isopropyl myristate, MO = mineral oil, WPJ = white petroleum jelly. Table 5. Vehicle ronmilntion LF \ flux (iig/cnr/h) IM 5%, WPJ 95% 18 MO 15%, WPJ 85% 6 IM 5%, MO 95% 2 [00308] Thus, a formulation of latanoprost comprising petroleum jelly and isopropyl myristate, but lacking mineral oil, provided superior delivery of LFA to formulations of latanoprost comprising mineral oil with isopropyl myristate, petroleum jelly, or both. Example 8 [00309] Compositions as described in Example 2, comprising latanoprost at a final concentration of 0.1% or 0.5%, were tested in Gottingen minipigs (3 animals per dose concentration). All animals were treated once daily for 10 days, over 10% of body surface area on the dorsal skin. Animals were monitored for skin condition, body weight, and safety. Serial plasma samples were taken to assess pharmacokinetics. Twenty-four hours after the last dose, animals were sacrificed. Skin and fat were dissected from the treatment area. Tissues were examined histologically. Tissue was also used to measure drug (LFA) concentrations in subcutaneous fat (mid-depth of tissue) by liquid chromatography / tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The product was well tolerated, with no adverse effects in any animal. LFA concentrations in subcutaneous fat and plasma on Day 10 are shown in Table 6. CB = chlorobutanol; IM = isopropyl myristate Table 6.

Example 9 [00311] Compositions as described in Example 2, comprising latanoprost at a final concentration of 0.1% or 0.5%, were tested on the periocular skin of Gottingen minipigs (3 animals per dose concentration). All animals were treated once daily for 10 days. Animals were monitored for skin condition, body weight, and safety. Twenty-four hours after the last dose, animals were sacrificed. Skin and fat were dissected from the treatment area. Some of this tissue was examined histologically. The product was well tolerated, with no adverse effects in any animal. Example 10 [00312] Formulations consisting of latanoprost (0.1% or 0.5%), chlorobutanol 0.5%, isopropyl myristate 5%, and white petroleum jelly q.s. (all w/w) were tested in a standard rabbit ocular irritation test. The formulations did not cause any adverse effects. Example 9 [00313] A composition comprising isopropyl myristate 5%, propylene glycol 15%, and white petroleum jelly 80% (without active ingredient) was applied to skin on the volar forearms on healthy adult men and women (η =4). The application area was 5 cm χ 5 cm. Application was once daily for 7 consecutive days. Skin condition and participant experience were noted daily, with results as follows: Table 4. Participant Skin ('oiulition Participant F\perience 1 Normal (100%) Well-tolerated, aesthetically pleasing 2 Normal (100%) Well-tolerated, aesthetically pleasing 3 Normal (100%) Well-tolerated, aesthetically pleasing 4 Normal (100%) Well-tolerated, aesthetically pleasing [00314] Thus, the above formulations were non-irritating and aesthetically pleasing when applied to human skin. Example 10 [00315] Different compositions, comprising latanoprost, e.g., 0.1% w/w, are tested on obese mice. Mice approximately six weeks old, all with similar baseline body mass, are randomized and prospectively treated as follows (η = 5 animals per group): Table 5. Group Compound Formulation (w/w ) Table 5. Group Compound Formulation (w/w ) A Vehicle only White petroleum jelly 100% Β Vehicle only IM 5%, CB 0.5%, white petroleum jelly q.s. C Latanoprost White petroleum jelly q.s. D Latanoprost IM 5% CB 0.5%, white petroleum jelly q.s. [00316] The dose is 0.1 cc to the right flank, daily. Mice are fed ad libitum and weighed daily for about 28 days. On or about day 28, mice are sacrificed and samples of skin with subcutaneous fat are collected for histologic examination. It is predicted that after about 28 days, mice in Group D will show relatively less weight gain (or more weight loss) and relatively less adiposity compared to mice in any of Groups A, Β, or C. Thus, it is predicted that in a mouse model of obesity, the foregoing results show superior reduction of adiposity with a latanoprost formulation comprising petroleum jelly, chlorobutanol, and isopropyl myristate, as compared to a equimolar latanoprost formulation with a vehicle consisting essentially of petroleum jelly. Example 11 [00317] A composition consisting essentially of latanoprost 0.5%, isopropyl myristate 5%, chlorobutanol 0.5%, and white petroleum jelly 94% (all w/w) was administered to the dorsal skin (10% of body surface area) of six Gottingen minipigs, once daily for 13 weeks. An equal number of animals are treated with a placebo composition, consisting essentially of isopropyl myristate 5%, chlorobutanol 0.5%, and white petroleum jelly 94.5%. (all w/w). Animals were observed for safety and tolerability. The compositions were well tolerated in all animals. After 13 weeks, animals were sacrificed and dorsal skin, fat, and muscle were dissected en bloc from a standardized portion of the treatment area. As compared to animals treated with the placebo composition, there was gross atrophy, ℓ℮., a thickness reduction of 30% to 70%, of subcutaneous fat in animals treated with the latanoprost 0.5% article. Example 12 [00318] From the study described in Example 11, a portion of the tissue is fixed in formalin, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined histopathologically. Subcutaneous fat thickness is measured systematically, for example by measuring the thickness of fat from the dermis to the panniculus camosus using image analysis software such as ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). From another portion of the tissue, subcutaneous fat is dissected, washed, pulverized, and homogenized, with the homogenate submitted for quantification of latanoprost free acid concentration using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (a method known in the art). It is predicted that the composition containing latanoprost will be associated with reduced subcutaneous fat thickness, as compared to control. It is further predicted that the latanoprost composition will be associated with amounts of latanoprost free acid in subcutaneous fat that are considered therapeutically effective, with reference to other in vivo experiments and in vitro assays. It is further predicted that the latanoprost composition of this example will be associated with higher tissue concentrations of latanoprost free acid and/or higher degrees of subcutaneous fat reduction compared to other formulations hitherto disclosed. Example 13 [00319] The following experiment describes a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in human subjects to test whether the safety and efficacy of a PFPRA compound composition for reduction of submental fat. The composition can be, for example, as described in Example 2, wherein the PFPRA compound is latanoprost. Alternatively, the PFPRA compound can be, for example, tafluprost. [00320] Eligible subjects (for example, η = 60) with excess submental fat are entered into a randomized double-blind study. Subjects are randomized in 1:1 fashion to receive either the active composition (for example, comprising latanoprost 0.3%), or the corresponding inactive vehicle. Subjects are instructed to apply, once a day, a dose of 0.5 ml in a thin film the chin. Serial clinical assessments, photographs, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans are performed prior to the first dose and then at 13 weeks. Treatment continues for a total of 13 weeks. It is contemplated that over time, for example after 13 weeks of treatment, the composition comprising latanoprost (or tafluprost) will be associated with more reduction in the depth and/or volume of submental fat, as measured by clinical assessment and/or MRI, as compared to vehicle alone. Example 14 [00321] The following experiment describes a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in human subjects to test whether the safety and efficacy of a PFPRA compound composition for reduction of periorbital fat. The composition can be, for example, a sterile composition as described in Example 4, wherein the PFPRA compound is latanoprost. Alternatively, the PFPRA compound can be, for example, tafluprost. [00322] Eligible subjects (for example, η = 60) with excess periorbital fat are entered into a randomized double-blind study. Subjects are randomized in 1:1 fashion to receive either the active composition (for example, comprising latanoprost 0.1%), or the corresponding inactive vehicle. Subjects are instructed to apply, once a day, a dose of 0.1 ml in a thin film the periorbital skin. Serial clinical assessments and photographs are performed prior to the first dose and then at 6 and 12 weeks. Treatment continues for a total of 12 weeks. It is contemplated that over time, for example after 12 weeks of treatment, the composition comprising latanoprost (or other active ingredient) will be associated with more reduction in the volume of periorbital fat, as measured by clinical assessment, as compared to vehicle alone. Example 15 [00323] A latanoprost ointment was prepared according to Example 2 and subjected to various doses of gamma radiation, as are commonly used for sterilization. A validated HPLC method was used to evaluate the ointment for latanoprost content and degradants. Significant degradation of latanoprost was observed at all gamma radiation doses. Thus, it was found that gamma irradiation is not suitable for sterilizing compositions comprising latanoprost.
