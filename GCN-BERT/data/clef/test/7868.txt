FIELD OF THE INVENTION A method is described for selectively acylating an amino group in a peptide or protein which has two or more reactive nucleophilic functional groups. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A large number of peptides have been approved for use in medical practice, and the peptides may be produced in suitable host cells by recombinant DNA technology or they may be produced synthetically by well established peptide synthesis technology. However, native peptides as well as analogues thereof tend to exhibit high clearance rates which are unacceptable for many clinical indications where a high plasma concentration of the peptide is required over a prolonged period of time. A variety of derivatizations of peptides and peptide analogs have been found to influence the clearance rate of the peptides in a favourable direction as e.g. described in WO98/08871, WO98/08872, WO99/43708, EP 1227107 and WO00/55119. One such derivatization is the introduction of a lipophilic acyl group into the therapeutic peptide causing a desirable protracted profile of action relative to the non-acylated peptide. Hence, less frequent administration of the therapeutic protein improves the patients compliance to the prescribed therapy, and it reduces the amount of peptide to be administered. In order for therapeutic peptides to be economically viable the cost of producing the peptides as well as the therapeutic dosage of the peptide are pivotal. A major cost during production of therapeutic peptides is the purification steps required to separate the target protein from impurities which are closely related to the target protein. These purification steps are usually performed by chromatography implying expensive chromatography matrices and solvents as well as reduced overall yield. Introduction of an acyl group into one or more sites of a peptide or protein with more than one nucleophilic atom, such as more than one amine, can give rise to a product mixture of product-related impurities with great resemblance to the desired compound in the crude mixture which gives rise to loss of product and subsequently, a difficult purification step. It is the aim of the present invention to provide an efficient, robust and economic method for the introduction of lipophilic groups into peptides or proteins via a spacer. Said spacer may e.g. be composed of one or more 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid moietie(s) and glutamic acid. The method is more specific, robust and thus results in higher yields and reduced formation of closely related impurities than other known methods. A significant reduction of the cost of producing the acylated peptides or proteins is achieved. Less expensive acylated peptides are highly desirable for maximizing the number of patients for whom the treatment is available as well as for exploiting the advantages of alternative delivery routes which have lower bioavailability than subcutaneous injection, e.g. transdermal, pulmonal or oral delivery WO2007/009894 and WO2008/087190 describe solid-phase acylation methods. WO2009/083549 describes acylation with protected acylation reagents. The present invention thus provides a method for selectively acylating the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue in a peptide or protein with surprisingly high selectivity. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A method for selectively acylating one amino group in a peptide or protein which has two or more reactive nucleophilic functional groups is described. In one aspect the method comprises: a) reacting in an aqueous media a peptide or protein having at least two reactive nucleophilic functional groups with an acylating agent of the general formula I wherein n is 1-6 m is 1-2 w is 4-20 R1 is a leaving group which when reacting said acylating agent with a free amine facilitates the formation of an amide bond between the carbonyl group attached to R1 and said amine; wherein pH in the aqueous media is between from pH 8 to pH 14; andb) isolating the N-acylated peptide or protein; wherein an N-acylated peptide or protein is obtained comprising at least one free reactive nucleophilic functional group which is not or only partially acylated. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Figure 1 : Acylation of [Aib8, Arg34]GLP-1(7-37) with 22-carboxy-1-[(2,5-dioxo-1-pyrrolidinyl)oxy]-1,10,19,24-tetraoxo-3,6,12,15-tetraoxa-9,18,23- triazahentetracontan-41-oic acid (compound 1). Illustrated is the purity (as measured by HPLC at 260nm) dependency of the amount of added acylation agent and the pH. pH values illustrated are: pH 10.00 (-●-), pH 11.25 (-■-), and pH 12.00 (-▲-). DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present method provides a method of securing a selective acylation in a desired position of a peptide or protein. By conducting the acylation reaction of the invention it has surprisingly been shown that a selective acylation can be obtained and thus an impurity profile of the acylation reaction mixture in the form of less undesirable impurities which after termination of the acylation process enables a much easier purification and isolation of the desired selectively acylated product. Also by the present invention a method of acylation is obtained wherein the acylated peptide or protein is obtained without the use of harsh reagents in or after the acylation step. The obtained product is thus obtained in higher yield and furthermore, due to the convergent method used, by a cheaper method than when using a non-convergent method. According to the invention an acylation reagent is used which comprises between 1 to 6 OEG spacers, wherein an OEG spacer is a 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (which may also be named [2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethoxy]acetic acid) moiety of the formula: When such OEG spacer(s) are present in the acylation agent and a conventional acylation method is used, it is the experience of the inventors that the acylation product is often obtained in low yields. The current invention provides an efficient and robust process of acylation of a peptide or protein with an acylation agent comprising 1 to 6 OEG spacers, wherein a product is provided in high yield. Acylation is the process of adding an acyl group to a compound. An "acylating agent" is thus herein defined as the compound providing the acyl group to be added to a peptide or protein. By "selective acylation" or "selectivity" is herein meant that the acylating reagent primarily reacts at one position of the peptide or protein to be acylated compared to other positions in the peptide or protein. For example, the product obtained from acylating a peptide or protein using the acylation method according to the invention results in an acylation product wherein an acylation side chain is attached to only one position of the peptide or protein and not all positions where an acylation could have been obtained had the acylation not been selective. In one aspect of the invention, selectivity is obtained such that acylation of the peptide or protein is obtained such that at least 50 % of the acylated peptides or proteins in a reaction mixture are acylated in the preferred acylation site upon completion of the acylation reaction. In one aspect at least 60% of the acylated peptides or proteins in a reaction mixture are acylated in the preferred acylation site upon completion of the acylation reaction. In another aspect at least 70% of the acylated peptides or proteins are acylated in the preferred acylation site. In another aspect at least 80% of the acylated peptides or proteins are acylated in the preferred acylation site. In another aspect at least 85% of the acylated peptides or proteins are acylated in the preferred acylation site. In another aspect at least 90% of the acylated peptides or proteins are acylated in the preferred acylation site. In another aspect at least 95% of the acylated peptides or proteins are acylated in the preferred acylation site. In another aspect at least 97% of the acylated peptides or proteins are acylated in the preferred acylation site. In another aspect at least 98% of the acylated peptides or proteins are acylated in the preferred acylation site. In another aspect at least 99% of the acylated peptides or proteins are acylated in the preferred acylation site and in yet another aspect approximately all the acylated peptides or proteins in a reaction mixture are acylated in the preferred acylation site upon completion of the acylation reaction. In one aspect of the invention the preferred acylation site on the peptide or protein is the ε-amino group of a lysine residue such that selective acylation primarily is obtained on the ε-amino group of said lysine. The term "peptide or protein" as used herein means a compound composed of at least five constituent amino acids connected by peptide bonds. The constituent amino acids may be from the group of the amino acids encoded by the genetic code and they may be natural amino acids which are not encoded by the genetic code, as well as synthetic amino acids. Natural amino acids which are not encoded by the genetic code are e.g., γ-carboxyglutamate, ornithine, phosphoserine, D-alanine and D-glutamine. Synthetic amino acids comprise amino acids manufactured by chemical synthesis, i.e. D-isomers of the amino acids that are encoded by the genetic code such as D-alanine and D-leucine, Aib (α-amirioisobutyric acid), Abu (α-aminobutyric acid), Tle (tert-butylglycine), β-alanine, 3-aminomethyl benzoic acid, anthranilic acid. The 22 proteogenic amino acids are: Alanine, Arginine, Asparagine, Aspartic acid, Cysteine, Cystine, Glutamine, Glutamic acid, Glycine, Histidine, Hydroxyproline, Isoleucine, Leucine, Lysine, Methionine, Phenylalanine, Proline, Serine, Threonine, Tryptophan, Tyrosine, Valine. Thus a non-proteogenic amino acid is a moiety which can be incorporated into a peptide or protein via peptide bonds but is not a proteogenic amino acid. Examples are γ-carboxyglutamate, ornithine, phosphoserine, the D-amino acids such as D-alanine and D-glutamine, Synthetic non-proteogenic amino acids comprise amino acids manufactured by chemical synthesis, i.e. D-isomers of the amino acids encoded by the genetic code such as D-alanine and D-leucine, Aib (α-aminoisobutyric acid), Abu (α-aminobutyric acid), ornithine, Dap (2,3-diaminopropionic acid), Dab (2,4-diaminobutanoic acid), Tle (tert-butylglycine), 3-aminomethyl benzoic acid, anthranilic acid, des-amino-Histidine, the beta analogs of amino acids such as β-alanine etc. D-histidine, desamino-histidine, 2-amino-histidine, β-hydroxy-histidine, homohistidine, Nα-acetyl-histidine, α-fluoromethyl-histidine, α-methyl-histidine, 3-pyridylalanine, 2-pyridylalanine or4-pyridylalanine, (1-aminocyclopropyl) carboxylic acid, (1-aminocyclobutyl) carboxylic acid, (1-aminocyclopentyl) carboxylic acid, (1-aminocyclohexyl) carboxylic acid, (1-aminocycloheptyl) carboxylic acid, or (1-aminocyclooctyl) carboxylic acid; The term "analogue" as used herein referring to a peptide or protein means a modified peptide or protein wherein one or more amino acid residues of the peptide or proteins have been substituted by other amino acid residues and/or wherein one or more amino acid residues have been deleted from the peptide or protein and/or wherein one or more amino acid residues have been deleted from the peptide or protein and or wherein one or more amino acid residues have been added to the peptide or protein. Such addition or deletion of amino acid residues can take place at the N-terminal of the peptide or protein and/or at the C-terminal of the peptide or protein. A simple system is often used to describe analogues : For example [Aib8, Arg34]GLP-1(7-37) designates a GLP-1(7-37) analogue wherein the naturally occurring alanine at position 8 is substituted with alpha-aminoisobutyric acid and lysine at position 34 has been substituted with arginine. All amino acids for which the optical isomer is not stated is to be understood to mean the L-isomer. In aspects of the invention a maximum of 17 amino acids have been modified. In aspects of the invention a maximum of 15 amino acids have been modified. In aspects of the invention a maximum of 10 amino acids have been modified. In aspects of the invention a maximum of 8 amino acids have been modified. In aspects of the invention a maximum of 7 amino acids have been modified. In aspects of the invention a maximum of 6 amino acids have been modified. In aspects of the invention a maximum of 5 amino acids have been modified. In aspects of the invention a maximum of 4 amino acids have been modified. In aspects of the invention a maximum of 3 amino acids have been modified. In aspects of the invention a maximum of 2 amino acids have been modified. In aspects of the invention 1 amino acid has been modified. In one aspect of the invention, the C-terminal of the derivative according to the invention may be terminated as either an acid or amide. In one aspect, the C-terminal of the derivative of the invention is an amide. In another aspect, the C-terminal of the derivative of the invention is an acid. It should be understood that the peptide or protein should carry at least two reactive nucleophilic functional groups, for example amino groups being e.g. the N-terminal amino group and/or a side chain amino group. The peptides or proteins may comprise amino acids which are not encoded by the genetic code, such as D-amino acids, 3-hydroxyproline, Aib (α-aminoisobutyric acid), ornithine, Dap (2,3-diaminopropionic acid), Dab (2,4-diaminobutanoic acid) and pentylglycine. Particularly interesting are amino groups of lysine, ornithine, Dap and Dab amino acid residues. The method is particular relevant for the N-acylation of the ε-amino group of lysine residues. Herein, the naming of the peptides or proteins is done according to the following principles: The names are given as mutations and modifications (acylations) relative to the parent peptide or protein such as human GLP-1 or human insulin. For the naming of the acryl moiety, the naming is done according to IUPAC nomenclature and in other cases as peptide nomenclature. For example, naming the acyl moiety: can be e.g. "octadecanedioyl-γGlu-OEG-OEG", or "17-carboxyheptadecanoyl-γGlu-OEG-OEG", wherein OEG is short hand notation for the amino acid -NH(CH2)2O(CH2)2OCH2CO-, and γGlu (or gGlu) is short hand notation for the amino acid gamma glutamic acid moiety. In one aspect a peptide or protein to be acylated according to the invention has at least two reactive nucleophilic functional groups which can react with the acylating reagent. In another aspect the peptide or protein has between 2 and 10 reactive nucleophilic functional groups, for example between 2 and 8 reactive nucleophilic functional groups, between 2 and 6 reactive nucleophilic functional groups, between 2 and 4 reactive nucleophilic functional groups or between 2 and 3 reactive nucleophilic functional groups. In one aspect the peptide or protein has 2 reactive nucleophilic functional groups. Reactive nucleophilic functional groups are herein to be understood as chemical functionalities that under the given reaction conditions react with the acylating reagent to form a stabile covalent bond. Examples of such reactive nucleophilic functional groups include, but are not limited to, hydroxyl-groups from e.g. tyrosine (where the hydroxyl group can react with the acylating reagent), serine (where the hydroxyl group can react with the acylating reagent), threonine (where the hydroxyl group can react with the acylation reagent), thiol groups from e.g. cysteine (where the thiol group can react with the acylating reagent) amino-groups such as but not limited to e.g. the Nα-terminus amine of the peptide or protein, lysine (where the ε-amino group can react with the acylating reagent), and other nucleophiles within the peptide or protein such as but not limited to arginine (where the guanidine group can react with the acylating reagent) and histidine (where the imidazole group can react with the acylating reagent). In one aspect a peptide or protein to be acylated according to the invention has at least two free amino groups. In another aspect the peptide or protein has between 2 and 10 free amino groups, for example between 2 and 8 free amino groups, between 2 and 6 free amino groups, between 2 and 4 free amino groups or between 2 and 3 free amino groups. In one aspect the peptide or protein has 2 free amino groups. When used herein the term "free amino group" shall mean a primary or secondary amino group which under the given reaction conditions reacts with the acylating agent to form a covalent bond. The term "partially acylated" when used in connection with at least one free amino group of an N-acylated peptide, shall mean that in a reaction mixture comprising said N-acylated peptide, a part of the peptides in the reaction mixture have at least one free amino group which is not connected to an acylation moiety and another part of the peptides have the same at least one amino group which is connected to an acylation moiety. The peptide or protein to be acylated may comprise one or more lysine (Lys) amino acid residues. In one aspect selection of the acylation position(s) is between ε-amino group(s) of lysine group(s) in the peptide or protein and the α-amino-group(s) in the N-terminal(s) of the peptide or protein, where acylation primarily is obtained on the one or more ε-amino group(s) rather than on the α-amino-group(s) in the N-terminal(s) of the peptide or protein. In one aspect the peptide or protein comprises one lysine (Lys) amino acid residue and one or more N-terminal α-amino-groups, where acylation is selective on the ε-amino group of the Lys amino acid. In one further aspect the peptide or protein comprises one lysine (Lys) amino acid residue and one N-terminal α-amino-group, where acylation is selective on the ε-amino group of the Lys amino acid. The "reaction mixture" is herein to be understood as the mixture of solvents and reagents used when reacting the acylating agent with the peptide or protein. The reaction mixture should be aqueous, i.e. water being present in the reaction mixture. To obtain selectivity of the acylation, the pH of the aqueous reaction mixture is adjusted to between pH 8 and pH 14. In one aspect pH of the reaction medium is between pH 9 and pH 13. In another aspect the pH is between pH 10 and pH 12. In another aspect the pH is between pH 12 and pH 13. In another aspect the pH is between pH 10 and pH 13. In another aspect the pH is between pH 10.5 and pH 12.0 or between pH 11.0 and pH 11.5, and in yet another aspect pH is about pH 11.0-11.3. In still another aspect pH is between pH 11 and pH 12, such as between pH 11.5 and pH 12 or between pH 11.5 and pH 11.8 or between pH 11.5 and pH 12.5. In one aspect pH is about pH 11.5. The terms "about" or "approximately" as used herein means in reasonable vicinity of the stated numerical value, such as plus or minus 10%, or for pH values plus or minus 0.2. By adjusting the pH according to the invention, a surprisingly robust acylation reaction is obtained. By "robust" or "robustness" when referring to the acylation reaction is herein meant that the yield and selectivity obtained when using the acylation process according to the invention are high and not sensitive to the amount of acylating agent added, when the acylating agent is added in excess (see e.g. Figure 1). The pH of the reaction mixture may be controlled by means known to the person skilled in the art. For example a simple pH-meter may be used to measure the pH and acid or base may be added manually to adjust the pH, or a pH-meter with a feed-back mechanism, which can control the pH of the solution, may be used. Acids suitable for adjusting the pH include but are not limited to: Hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid and acetic acid. Bases suitable for adjusting the pH include, but are not limited to: Tertiary amine bases such as, but not limited to, triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, alkalimetal hydroxides such as, but not limited to; lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or cesium hydroxide and alkali carbonates such as, but not limited to, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lithium carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate or lithium hydrogen carbonate. In one aspect of the invention the reaction mixture comprises a buffer. In one aspect of the invention the buffer is selected from the group consisting of: Phosphate buffer, Sodium carbonate buffer, Bicine N,N-Bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine buffer, HEPPS buffer (3-[4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinyl]propanesulfonic acid buffer), HEPES buffer (4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid buffer), MOPS buffer (3-(N-Morpholino)propanesulfonic acid buffer) and TEA buffer (Triethylamine buffer). The acylation reagent should preferably be either added to the solution as a solid or be dissolved in an appropriate inert solvent and then added as a solution. Examples of inert solvents are e.g. but not limited to N-methylpyrrolidinone, dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide, acetonitril, tetrahydrofuran, and dimethyl sulfoxide. The acylation agent may be added in an amount of e.g. 0.5 - 20 equivalents such as 1 - 20 equivalents, 1 - 5 equivalents or 1 - 3 equivalents relative to the number of reactive nucleophilic functional groups such as amino groups to be acylated. For example if adding 1 mole peptide or protein having 1 amino group to be acylated, the acylating agent can be added in an amount from 0.5 moles to 20 moles such as from 1 to 5 moles. It has surprisingly been found that when using the method according to the invention, selectivity and robustness may be achieved even when adding a large excess of acylation reagent. In one aspect the acylation agent is added in an amount of 1 - 4 equivalents, alternatively 1.2 - 3.0 equivalents, alternatively 1.4 - 2.0 equivalents.

In one aspect the acylation mixture is left for between 15 and 240 min. In another aspect the acylation mixture is left for between 30 and 120 min.

For example salts or other compounds that are present in the peptide or protein e.g. via ionic bonds as a result of the peptide or protein synthesis may be present in the reaction mixture in the method according to the invention. Examples of such compounds and/or salts include but is not limited to: Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), acetic acid, hydrochloric acid (HCl), citric acid, phosphorus acid, sulfonic acid, sodium salt, potassium salt and lithium salt. In one aspect of the invention, the acyl group to be introduced into the peptide or protein such as the ε-amine group of a Lys residue of the peptide or protein comprises an albumin binding residue, i.e. a residue which under in vivo conditions binds to albumin when attached to a peptide or protein. In one aspect, the albumin binding residue is a lipophilic residue. In a further aspect, the lipophilic residue is attached to the peptide or protein via a linker. In a further aspect of the invention, the albumin binding residue is negatively charged at physiological pH. In another aspect of the invention, the albumin binding residue comprises a group which can be negatively charged. One preferred group which can be negatively charged is a carboxylic acid group. In one aspect, the albumin binding residue is an α,ω-fatty diacid residue In a further aspect of the invention, the α,ω-fatty diacid residue of the lipophilic residue has from 6 to 40 carbon atoms, from 8 to 26 carbon atoms or from 8 to 22 carbon atoms.

In a further aspect the albumin binding residue is an acyl group of a straight-chain or branched alkane α,ω-dicarboxylic acid which includes an amino acid portion such as e.g. a gamma-Glu portion. In yet a further aspect the albumin binding residue is an acyl group of a straight-chain or branched alkane α,ω-dicarboxylic acid which includes two amino acid portions such as e.g. a gamma-Glu portion and a 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (OEG) portion. In yet a further aspect the albumin binding residue is an acyl group of a straight-chain or branched alkane α,ω-dicarboxylic acid which includes more amino acid portions such as e.g. one gamma-Glu portion and consecutive 8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid (OEG) portions. In the method according to the invention, a peptide or protein which has at least two reactive nucleophilic functional groups is reacted with an acylating agent of the general formula I wherein n is 1-6, alternatively 1-3, 1-2, alternatively 2m is 1-2, alternatively 2w is 4-20, alternatively 10-20, alternatively 14-18, alternatively 16 R1 is a leaving group which when reacting said acylating agent with a free amine facilitates the formation of an amide bond between the carbonyl group attached to R1 and said amine The acylating agent may be in the form of a pure enantiomer wherein the stereo configuration of the chiral amino acid moiety is either D or L (or if using the R/S terminology: either R or S) or it may be in the form of a mixture of enantiomers (D and L / R and S). In one aspect of the invention the acylating agent is in the form of a mixture of enantiomers. In one aspect the acylating agent is in the form of a pure enantiomer. In one aspect the chiral amino acid moiety of the acylating agent is in the D form. In one aspect the chiral amino acid moiety of the acylating agent is in the L form. R1 in formula I may be any group which when reacting the acylating agent with a free amine acts as a leaving group, such that an amide bond between the carbonyl group attached to R1 and the amine is formed. For example R1 together with the carbonyl to which R1 is attached may designate an anhydride, a carboxylic acid halide or an ester. In one aspect R1 in formula I together with the carbonyl to which R1 is attached designate an ester such as an activated ester or an activated N-hydroxy imide ester. Each of these esters constitutes alternative aspects of the present invention. Activated esters and activated N-hydroxy imide esters are well known in the art of organic chemistry (especially in peptide chemistry) as functional groups which are used in acylation of amino, thio and hydroxy groups. Within the context of the present invention, the term "activated ester or an activated N-hydroxy imide ester" is intended to mean an ester functionalised form of a carboxylic acid group suitable for acylating an amine, preferably a primary amine. It should thus be understood, that selectivity for acylation of primary amines is preferred over acylating of hydroxy and thio groups. Activated N-hydroxy imide esters are especially preferred. The term "activated" acylating agent means an acylating agent which has been activated using general techniques as e.g. described in "Amide bond formation and peptide coupling" (Tetrahedron 61(46), 10827-10852, 2005).

Chan and P.D. White, Oxford University Press, 2000, ISBN 0-19-963724-5). The acylating agent of the formula I is used in a slight deficiency, equal amount or slight excess relative to the number of amino groups of the peptide or protein to be acylated. The ratio may e.g. be from 1:0.5 relative to the number of reactive nucleophilic functional groups such as amino groups to be acylated according to the procedure and is typically from 1:1 to 1:20 with equal amount or an excess of the acylating agent, alternatively from 1:1.1 to 1:5 relative to the number of reactive nucleophilic functional groups such as amino groups to be acylated according to the procedure. The acylating agent may be added to the reaction mixture as a solid or it may be added to the reaction mixture as a solution. When the acylating agent is added as a solution it is dissolved in inert solvent, wherein the term "inert" means inert to the acylating agent. The stability of the acylating agent may be improved (i.e. stabilized) by adding an acid. In one aspect of the method, the acylating agent is added to the reaction mixture as a solid. In one aspect of the method, said peptide or protein used as starting material for step a) has a peptide or protein purity of at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 93%, at least 95%, or at least 97% as determined by HPLC. As a typical example, the reaction in step (a) is performed using the peptide or protein and the acylating agent of the formula I in a 1:1 to 1:5 molar ratio. The peptide or protein is typically pre-dissolved in water at -10 - 30°C such as 0 - 30°C and the pH is adjusted to the desired pH level using an alkalimetal hydroxide (e.g. sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide) or a tertiary amine base (e.g. triethyl amine or N,N-diisopropylethylamine). The pH value may be further adjusted using acids (e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfonic acid or acetic acid), but the temperature is preferably within the above range. Alternatively the peptide or protein is pre-dissolved directly in an aqueous solution comprising an appropriate amount of the relevant acid or base. The acylating agent is subsequently added as a solid or as a solution. The reaction is typically allowed to proceed to completion (can be monitored by HPLC) which is typically obtained from instantly and up to within 24 hours, such as 0.2-6 hours, before addition of an acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfonic acid or acetic acid, to pH 6.5-9.0 such as to e.g. pH 7.5-8.0. The product is typically isolated and purified by ion-exchange chromatograhpy, HPLC, and/or is precipitated by isoelectric pH. The present invention is especially suitable for the acylation of peptides or proteins suitable for treating e.g. diabetes such as glucagon-like peptides and insulins. In one aspect the peptide or protein to be acylated is a glucagon-like peptide. The term "glucagon-like peptide" as used herein means the glucagon family of peptides, exendins and analogues thereof. The glucagon family of peptides are encoded by the preproglucagon gene and encompasses three small peptides with a high degree of homology, i.e. glucagon (1-29), GLP-1 (1-37) and GLP-2 (1-33). Exendins are peptides expressed in lizards and like GLP-1, are insulinotropic. Examples of exendins are exendin-3 and exendin-4. The terms GLP-1, GLP-2, exendin-3 and exendin-4 are known to a person skilled in the art. For example "GLP-1 compound" or "GLP-1 peptide" as used herein means human GLP-1(7-37), insulinotropic analogue thereof and insulinotropic derivatives thereof. Nonlimiting examples of GLP-1 analogues are GLP-1 (7-36) amide, Arg34-GLP-1(7-37), Aib8Arg34-GLP-1(7-37), Gly8-GLP-1(7-37), Val8-GLP-1(7-36)-amide and Val8Asp22-GLP-1(7-37). Non-limiting examples of GLP-1 derivatives are desamino-His7, Arg26, Lys34(Nε-(γ-Glu(Nα-hexadecanoyl)))-GLP-1(7-37), desamino-His7, Arg26, Lys34(Nε-octanoyl)-GLP-1 (7-37), Arg26,34, Lys38(Nε-(ω-carboxypentadecanoyl))-GLP-1(7-38), Arg26,34, Lys36(Nε-(γ-Glu(Nα-hexadecanoyl)))-GLP-1(7-36) and Arg34, Lys26(Nε-(γ-Glu(Nα-hexadecanoyl)))-GLP-1(7-37). In one aspect the glucagon-like peptide according to the invention is dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV protected. In another aspect the GLP-1 analogue according to the invention is dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV protected. The term "dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV protected" as used herein means a glucagon-like peptide, e.g. a GLP-1 analogue, which is more resistant to dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPP-IV) than the native compound, e.g. GLP-1 (7-37). Such protection may be obtained by e.g. mutations and/or derivatization of the native compound. Resistance of a GLP-1 compound towards degradation by dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV is determined by the following degradation assay: Aliquots of the GLP-1 compound (5 nmol) are incubated at 37 °C with 1 µL of purified dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV corresponding to an enzymatic activity of 5 mU for 10-180 minutes in 100 µL of 0.1 M triethylamine-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. Enzymatic reactions are terminated by the addition of 5 µL of 10% trifluoroacetic acid, and the peptide degradation products are separated and quantified using HPLC analysis. One method for performing this analysis is: The mixtures are applied onto a Vydac C18 widepore (30 nm pores, 5 µm particles) 250 x 4.6 mm column and eluted at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with linear stepwise gradients of acetonitrile in 0.1 % trifluoroacetic acid (0% acetonitrile for 3 min, 0-24% acetonitrile for 17 min, 24-48% acetonitrile for 1 min) according to Siegel et al., Regul. Pept. 1999;79:93-102 and Mentlein et al. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993;214:829-35. Peptides and their degradation products may be monitored by their absorbance at 220 nm (peptide bonds) or 280 nm (aromatic amino acids), and are quantified by integration of their peak areas related to those of standards. The rate of hydrolysis of a GLP-1 compound by dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV is estimated at incubation times which result in less than 10% of the GLP-1 compound being hydrolysed. The term "insulinotropic" as used herein referring to a glucagon-like peptide means the ability to stimulate secretion of insulin in response to an increased plasma glucose level. Insulinotropic glucagon-like peptides are agonists of the GLP-1 receptor. The insulinotropic property of a compound may be determined by in vitro or in vivo assays known in the art. The following in vitro assay may be used to determine the insulinotropic nature of a compound such as a glucagon-like peptide. Preferably insulinotropic compounds exhibit an EC50 value in the below assay of less than 5 nM, even more preferably an EC50 value of less than 500 pM. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells expressing the cloned human GLP-1 receptor (BHK 467-12A) are grown in DMEM media with the addition of 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 µL/mL streptomycin, 10% foetal calf serum and 1 mg/mL Geneticin G-418 (Life Technologies). Plasma membranes are prepared by homogenization in buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 30 mM NaCl and 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.4, containing, in addition, 5 mg/mL leupeptin (Sigma), 5 mg/L pepstatin (Sigma), 100 mg/L bacitracin (Sigma), and 16 mg/L aprotinin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem, La Jolla, CA)). The homogenate is centrifuged on top of a layer of 41 % W/v sucrose. The white band between the two layers is diluted in buffer and centrifuged. Plasma membranes are stored at -80 °C until used. The functional receptor assay is carried out by measuring cAMP as a response to stimulation by the insulinotropic peptide or insulinotropic compound. Incubations are carried out in 96-well microtiter plates in a total volume of 140 mL and with the following final concentrations: 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1.5 mM MgSO4, 1.7 mM ATP, 20 mM GTP, 2 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 0.01% w/v Tween-20, pH 7.4. Compounds are dissolved and diluted in buffer. GTP is freshly prepared for each experiment: 2.5 µg of membrane is added to each well and the mixture is incubated for 90 min at room temperature in the dark with shaking. The reaction is stopped by the addition of 25 mL 0.5 M HCl. Formed cAMP is measured by a scintillation proximity assay (RPA 542, Amersham, UK). A dose-response curve is plotted for the compound and the EC50 value is calculated using GraphPad Prism software. The term "prodrug of an insulinotropic compound" as used herein means a chemically modified compound which following administration to the patient is converted to an insulinotropic compound. Such prodrugs are typically amino acid extended versions or esters of an insulinotropic compound. The term "exendin-4 compound" as used herein is defined as exendin-4(1-39), insulinotropic fragments thereof, insulinotropic analogs thereof and insulinotropic derivatives thereof. Insulinotropic fragments of exendin-4 are insulinotropic peptides for which the entire sequence can be found in the sequence of exendin-4 and where at least one terminal amino acid has been deleted. Examples of insulinotropic fragments of exendin-4(1-39) are exendin-4(1-38) and exendin-4(1-31). The insulinotropic property of a compound may be determined by in vivo or in vitro assays well known in the art. For instance, the compound may be administered to an animal and monitoring the insulin concentration over time. Insulinotropic analogs of exendin-4(1-39) refer to the respective molecules wherein one or more of the amino acids residues have been exchanged with other amino acid residues and/or from which one or more amino acid residues have been deleted and/or from which one or more amino acid residues have been added with the proviso that said analogue either is insulinotropic or is a prodrug of an insulinotropic compound. An example of an insulinotropic analog of exendin-4(1-39) is Ser2Asp3-exendin-4(1-39) wherein the amino acid residues in position 2 and 3 have been replaced with serine and aspartic acid, respectively (this particular analog also being known in the art as exendin-3). Insulinotropic derivatives of exendin-4(1-39) and analogs thereof are what the person skilled in the art considers to be derivatives of these peptides, i.e. having at least one substituent which is not present in the parent peptide molecule with the proviso that said derivative either is insulinotropic or is a prodrug of an insulinotropic compound. Examples of substituents are amides, carbohydrates, alkyl groups, esters and lipophilic substituents. An example of an insulinotropic derivative of exendin-4(1-39) and analog thereof is Tyr31-exendin-4(1-31)-amide. The term "stable exendin-4 compound" as used herein means a chemically modified exendin-4(1-39), i.e. an analogue or a derivative which exhibits an in vivo plasma elimination half-life of at least 10 hours in man, as determined by conventional methods. The term "dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV protected exendin-4 compound" as used herein means an exendin-4 compound which is more resistant towards the plasma peptidase dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPP-IV) than exendin-4, as determined by the assay described under the definition of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV protected GLP-1 compound. The GLP-1 analogues may be such wherein the naturally occurring Lys at position 34 of GLP-1 (7-37) has been substituted with Arg. Also, derivatives of precursors or intermediates of insulinotropic peptides are covered by the invention. In one aspect of the invention the glucagon-like peptide is insulintropic. In a further aspect the insulintropic glucagon-like peptide is selected from the group consisting of GLP-1, GLP-2, exendin-4, exendin-3 and analogues and derivatives thereof. Conformational stability of protein based drugs is important for maintaining biological activity and for minimizing irreversible loss of structure due to denaturation and fibrillation. Especially large insulinotropic peptides and proteins are labile with respect to conformational change due to complicated refolding patterns. Also, insulinotropic peptides with a known history of fibrillation, such as GLP-1, are particularly sensitive towards destabilization of tertiary structure (i.e. formation of a molten globular state). In one aspect, the constituent amino acids of a glucagon-like peptide according to the invention may be selected from the group of the amino acids encoded by the genetic code and they may be natural amino acids which are not encoded by the genetic code, as well as synthetic amino acids. Natural amino acids which are not encoded by the genetic code are e.g. hydroxyproline, γ-carboxyglutamate, ornithine, phosphoserine, D-alanine and D-glutamine. Synthetic amino acids comprise amino acids manufactured by chemical synthesis, i.e. D-isomers of the amino acids encoded by the genetic code such as D-alanine and D-leucine, Aib (α-aminoisobutyric acid), Abu (α-aminobutyric acid), Tle (tert-butylglycine), β-alanine, 3-aminomethyl benzoic acid, anthranilic acid.
