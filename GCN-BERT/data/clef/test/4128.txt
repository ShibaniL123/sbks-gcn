FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention is related to Fluidised Bed Bioreactors (FBR). Particularly, the present invention is related to a method for treating waste water in a fluidised bed bioreactor, wherein the organic matter present in waste water is oxidised in the presence of electrically conductive particles particles and bacteria from the genus Geobacter. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Microbial Electrochemical Technologies (METs) represent a number of technologies where bacteria interact with electrically conductive material. For instance, Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) converts chemical energy into electrical energy by using microorganisms. In this kind of electrochemical bioreactor, the oxidation of organic matter is carried out by microorganisms that efficiently transfer electrons to an electrode (anode). The circuit is closed by the presence of a cathode so electricity can be harvested. Other type of METs are the Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MEC), where electrodes are artificially polarised by means of a potentiostat or a power source so microbial can interact with the conductive surface to perform either oxidation or reduction of substrates. Biological waste water treatment is based on the biological oxidation of the organic matter present in the waste water. This oxidation needs coupling to a reduction reaction (e.g. oxygen reduction), usually limiting the process due to the high cost of artificially supply of oxygen to the system. To avoid this, there are some waste water treatments carried out under anaerobic conditions. These systems lead to the accumulation of short-chain organic acids as acetate (volatile fatty acids, VFAs). Among the different devices for waste water treatment available in the market, the so-called Fluidised Bed Bioreactors (FBR) have raised recent interest. They have the advantage of combining biofilm-biomass and high surface of contact by using a bed of fluidised particles that act as a sole physical support of an active biofilm of bacteria that clean up the waste water. FBR are usually used for promoting the growth of an active biofilm of micro-organisms associated to the bed of inert particles. FBR have been disclosed in the state of the art as a sole physical support for bacteria growth without any role as substrate. There are also applications of fluidised bed with electrochemical nature in the metallurgic field for promoting metal redox reactions. Nevertheless such applications does not include any biological element/application on waste water treatment. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Biological oxidation of organic matter present in the waste water classically needs coupling e.g. to oxygen reduction, requiring an artificial supply of oxygen. The present invention overcomes this problem by a method for treating waste water in a fluidised electrically-conductive bed bioreactor. The present invention provides a method for treating waste water in a fluidised bed bioreactor, which comprises the following steps: (a) adding electrically conductive particles to the solution present in the bioreactor, wherein said particles are fluidised in said solution,(b) adding a suspension of bacteria from the genus Geobacter in said bioreactor and(b) oxidising the organic matter present in waste water in the presence of said particles and said bacteria from the genus Geobacter, in the following, method of the invention. Geobacter bacteria store and transfer electrons to electrodes thorough cytochrome C proteins located in the extracellular membrane of the bacteria (Esteve-Núñez A. et al. Fluorescent properties of c-type cytochromes reveal their potential role as an extracytoplasmic electron sink in Geobacter sulfurreducens. Environ Microbiol. 2008 Feb;10(2): 497-505; Schrott et al., Electrochemical insight into the mechanism of electron transport in biofilms of Geobacter sulfurreducens. Electrochimica Acta 2011, 56, 10791-10795); said cytochrome C proteins are present in all disclosed species of Geobacter. The particles of the method of the invention are graphite particles or any other electrically conductive material as conductive activated carbon or vitreous carbon. Thus, another embodiment is the method of the invention, wherein said particles are selected from the group consisting of graphite particles, conductive activated carbon particles and vitreous carbon particles. Another embodiment is the method of the invention, wherein said particles has a particle size equal to or lower than 1.5 mm. Another embodiment is the method of the invention, wherein said bacteria is Geobacter sulfurreducens. Fluidised bed bioreactors of the state of the art use a bed of fluidised particles that act as a sole physical support of an active biofilm of bacteria that clean up waste water. The present invention also uses a bed of fluidised particles that act as a physical support. However, the present invention also uses a material with electrically conductive characteristics that enhances the biodegradation of organic matter. This is possible by using bacteria from the Geobacter genus able to store electrons from the oxidation of organic matter and efficiently transfer them to electrically conductive fluidised bed due to their extracellular electron transfer capacity. Basically, the bacteria attached to the particles or even suspended in the solution oxidise the organic matter and transfer all these electrons into the electrochemical fluidised bed so they can be circulated to another electrode called counter electrode where they are consumed in the reduction of electroactive species present in solution. For instance, oxygen and water could accept electrons to respectively generate water or hydrogen as end-product. The main advantages of the present invention are: Enhancement of biodegradation rates of organic matter by combining the availability of an un-limited electron acceptor (fluidised bed) and the exocellular electron transfer ability of Geobacter.The biodegradation rate is not limited to those cells just forming a biofilm as typically exist in microbial fuel cell applications. Instead, all the cells in solution can participate in the process.Minimising the biomass production due to the lower growth yield of electrogenic bacteria (Geobacter)in situ monitoring of the biodegradation rate on real time through electric current measurement.No production of greenhouse gas (no or low methane production).

Acetate oxidation according to the method of the invention. EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION Example 1. Oxidation of organic matter according to the method of the invention. Geobacter sulfurreducens cells were pre-cultured in a chemostat using a culture medium containing acetate 10 mM and fumarate 10 mM. 1500 mL of a chemostat culture (OD600 = 0.125) were harvested, centrifuged and then resuspended in bicarbonate buffer to get a high-density suspension of charged cells. Said cells were then inoculated into a fluidised bed bioreactor. The bioreactor contained a solution of acetate 5 mM, bicarbonate buffer 100 mM and fluidised bed particles of granulated graphite with a particle size from 0.15 mm to 0.25 mm. Granulated graphite is an electroactive material. Just after inoculation of the cells, a sharp discharge of current into the fluidised electrochemical bed was detected, as can be seen in Figure 2. Then, a constant increase of current due to microbial acetate oxidation was monitored for more than six hours before cells reach stationary phase and reduce their metabolism together with the current production.
