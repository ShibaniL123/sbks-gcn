Preparation Example 21: Preparation of 4-(6-bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-5,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-amine
Preparation Example 21-1: Preparation of 1-(6-bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-2-methylbutan-1,3-dione
1-(6-bromo-3-methoxypyridin-2-yl)butan-1,3-dione (15.41 g, 45.21 mmol) obtained in Preparation Example 3-4 was dissolved in acetonitrile (100 mL). To the resulting solution were added dropwise potassium carbonate (K2CO3) (16.88 g, 135.63 mmol) and iodomethane (CH3I) (4.56 mL, 90.42 mmol) and the solution was stirred for 18 hrs. The solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate, diluted with EtOAc, and washed with water. The washed organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane/ethylacetate = 3/1) to give the white title compound (15.18 g, 67 %).
