FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention pertains to eye protectors for use with a helmet for a firefighter or other emergency rescue worker. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Commonly, a helmet for a firefighter or for an industrial, chemical, or emergency rescue worker has a crown and a brim, which projects forwardly from the crown and which may project in other directions from the crown. Commonly, the helmet is equipped with a pair of eye shields, one for each eye of a wearer, and each of the pair of eye shields is adapted to be manually moved between a storage position and a usage position. In the usage position, but not in the storage position, the eye shield projects downwardly so as to shield a given eye of a wearer against sparks, liquids, particles, and other objects striking the front of the eye shield. An example of an eye shield, as described in the preceding paragraph, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,383,155 to Lester T. Bourke. As disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,383,155, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, each of the pair of eye shields is mounted to a helmet, beneath a brim projecting forwardly from a crown of the helmet, and each of the pair of eye shields is adapted to be manually flipped between the storage and usage positions and is stable in either of the storage and usage positions. Similar eye shields are available commercially from various sources including Morning Pride Manufacturing, L.L.C. of Dayton, Ohio. While these shields have performed well for their intended purpose, there is always room for improvement. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with one feature of the inventions, an eye protector is mountable to a protective helmet for use by a firefighter or other emergency worker, the protective helmet having a brim. The eye protector includes a bracket mounted to the brim, an eye shield movable between a storage position extending along the brim and a usage position extending downward from the brim to shield the eye of a wearer, and a snap fit connector on one of the bracket and eye shield to pivotably connect the eye shield to the bracket for movement between the storage and usage positions. As one feature, the eye protector further includes a journal on the other of the bracket and eye shield, the journal received in the snap fit connector to connect the eye shield to the bracket for movement between the storage and usage positions. In one feature, the journal includes a cylindrical element on the other of the bracket and eye shield. According to one feature, the journal includes plural cylindrical elements of the bracket and eye shield. As one feature, the journal is formed as a unitary part of the other of the bracket and eye shield. In one feature, the snap fit connector includes a bearing surface having a U-shaped transverse cross-section.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT As shown in FIG. 1, a protective helmet 10 of the type worn by a firefighter or other emergency worker has a crown 12 and a brim 14 that projects forwardly and laterally from the lower part of the crown 12. An eye protector 16 is provided on the helmet 10 in the form of a pair of transparent eye shields 18 that are mounted to the underside of the brim 14 by a bracket 20 for manual movement between a storage position and a usage position. The shields 18 are shown in the usage position in FIG. 1, with each shield 18 extending downward from the brim 14 to shield the eyes of a wearer against sparks, liquids, particles, and other such objects which will strike the front of the shields 18 rather than the eyes of a wearer. In the storage position, each of the shields 18 project forwardly along and beneath the brim 14, as shown in phantom in FIG. 1. As shown generally at 22, a snap fit connector or hinge is provided on either the bracket 20 or each of the eye shields 18 to pivotably connect the eye shields 18 to the bracket 20 for movement between the storage and usage position. With reference to the embodiment of the eye protector 16 shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, each of the eye shields 18 (only one shown in FIG. 3) includes a journal 24 in the form of a plurality of cylindrical elements 26. Preferably, each of the cylindrical elements 26 is separated by a spacer element 28, with shoulders 30 provided on the ends of the spacer elements 28 transverse to the longitudinal axis A of the cylindrical elements 26. The snap fit connector 22 includes a plurality of bearing surfaces 32 defined in connector or hinge elements 34 on the bracket 20, with each of the bearing surfaces 32 having a U-shaped or cylindrical-shaped transverse cross-section that is shaped to receive and conform to a corresponding one of the cylindrical elements 26. Shoulders 35 are provided on the ends of each of the connector elements 34 transverse to the longitudinal axis B. As best seen in FIG. 4, each U-shaped transverse cross-section is defined by a pair of legs 36 that extend upwardly from a base 38 to further define an opening 39 that is preferably narrower than the transverse thickness of the corresponding cylindrical element 26 so as to retain the cylindrical element 26 within the snap fit connector 22 after assembly. In this regard, it is preferred that a pair of chamfers 40 be provided on each of the legs to assist in assembling the cylindrical elements 26 into the snap fit connector 22. In the embodiment of FIGS. 2 and 3, each of the eye shields 18 is a one piece, unitary construction with each of the cylindrical elements 26 and spacer elements 28 formed as a unitary part of the eye shield 18, preferably by a suitable forming process, such as suitable molding and/or machining process. Similarly, the bracket 20 is a one piece, unitary construction with the features 32, 34, 36 and 38 being formed as a unitary part of the bracket 20 using a suitable forming process, such as a suitable molding and/or machine process. Furthermore, as best seen in FIG. 3, it may be desirable for the areas 42 adjacent the cylindrical elements 26 and spacer elements 28 to be of a thicker cross section than the remainder of the eye shield 18 to improve the structural integrity of the eye shield 18. No separate fasteners are required, or directed into, any of the cylindrical elements 26, the spacer elements 28, the eye shield 18, the hinge elements 34, or base 38, to: a) secure the cylindrical elements 26 and spacer elements 28 to the eye shield 18; or b) secure the hinge elements 34 to the base 38. As best seen in FIG. 2, the bracket also preferably includes one or more frictional lock features 44 that engage corresponding lock features 46 on the lens in both the usage and storage positions to retain the eye shield 18 in each position. FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate another embodiment of the eye protector 16 wherein a snap connector 22 is provided on each of the eye shields 18 rather than on the bracket 20. In this regard, the bracket 20 includes a pair of journals 50, each journal 50 to be received in the snap fit connector 22 of a corresponding one of the eye shields 18. Each of the journals 50 is provided in the form of a plurality of cylindrical elements 52, with each of the cylindrical elements 52 being separated by a spacer element 54, with shoulders 56 provided on the ends of the spacer elements 54 transverse to the longitudinal axis A of the cylindrical elements 52. Each of the snap fit connectors 22 includes a plurality of bearing surfaces 60 on the corresponding eye shield 18, with each of the bearing surfaces 60 having a U-shaped or cylindrical-shaped transverse cross-section that is shaped to receive and conform to a corresponding one of the cylindrical elements 52. As best seen in FIGS. 7A and 7B, the U-shaped transverse cross-section is defined by a pair of legs 62 that extend upwardly (FIG. 7A) or rearwardly (FIG. 7B) from a base 64 to further define an opening 66 that is preferably narrower than the transverse thickness of the corresponding cylindrical element 52 so as to retain the cylindrical element 52 within the snap fit connector 22 after assembly. It is preferred that a pair of chamfers 68 be provided on each of the legs to assist in assembling the cylindrical elements into the snap fit connector. While the embodiments of FIGS. 5 and 6 can be formed as one piece, unitary constructions in the same manner as described for the embodiments of FIGS. 3 and 4, an alternate construction is illustrated in FIGS. 5 and 6 wherein the snap fit connector 22 is formed as a separate component 70 that is then bonded or fastened to a unitary piece that forms the remainder of the eye shield 18. For the bracket 20, the cylindrical elements 52 are defined by a pair of cylindrical rods 72, that are interference fit through conforming cylindrical openings 74 formed in each of the spacer elements 54. 1.
