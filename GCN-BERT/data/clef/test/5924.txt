(Reference Example 17) Synthesis of 1-(1-(difluoromethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-3-(4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)propan-1,3-dione:
A solution of lithium diisopropylamide in tetrahydrofuran (2.0 M, 2.19 mL, 4.37 mmol) was added dropwise to a solution of 1-(4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)ethanone (0.310 g, 1.82 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (6.0 mL) at -78°C and the reaction liquid was stirred at the same temperature for 1 hour. A solution of ethyl 1-(difluoromethyl)-1H-imidazole-2-carboxylate (0.415 g, 2.19 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (3.0 mL) was added to the reaction liquid at the same temperature. The reaction liquid was stirred for 1 hour and stirred at 0°C for further 1 hour. A saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride, an aqueous solution of potassium carbonate were sequentially added to the reaction liquid and then the reaction liquid was extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was washed with a 10% aqueous solution of sodium chloride and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (NH silica gel, hexane/ethyl acetate) to obtain 1-(1-(difluoromethyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-3-(4-(dimethylamino)piperidin-1-yl)propan-1,3-dione (0.311 g, 0.989 mmol, 54%) as a yellow oil.
