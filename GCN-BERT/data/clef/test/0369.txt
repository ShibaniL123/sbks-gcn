[Step 2] Synthesis of tert-butyl 3-((2-fluoro-4-(hydrazinecarbonyl)benzyl)(phenyl)carbamoyl)azetidine-1-carboxylate
Tert-butyl 3-((2-fluoro-4-(methoxycarbonyl)benzyl)(phenyl)carbamoyl)azetidine-1-carboxylate (2.500 g, 5.650 mmol), synthesized in step 1, and hydrazine monohydrate (5.481 mL, 112.997 mmol) were mixed in ethanol (100 mL) at room temperature, and the mixture was heated at reflux for 12 hours and cooled down to room temperature. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the solvent, and water was added to the concentrate, followed by extraction with dichloromethane. The organic layer was washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate anhydrous, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The title compound was used without further purification (2.400 g, 96.0%) as a white solid.
