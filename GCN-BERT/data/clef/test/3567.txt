The figures are not necessarily drawn to scale, and in some instances the drawings have been exaggerated and/or simplified in places for illustrative purposes only. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the many possible applications and variations based on the following examples of possible embodiments. A. Introduction The present disclosure provides a fully head mounted implantable peripheral neurostimulation system designed for the treatment of chronic head pain. It incorporates multiple elements and features that take into account the unique anatomic, physiologic, and other related challenges of treating head pain with implantable neurostimulation, thereby greatly improving on therapeutic response, patient safety, medical risk, and medical costs, which combine to improve overall patient satisfaction. Prior implantable peripheral neurostimulation systems and components, including leads and pulse generators, have been designed and developed specifically as spinal cord stimulator systems and for the specific therapeutic purpose of treating chronic back and extremity pain. Over the years, these spinal cord stimulators were ultimately adopted and adapted for use as implantable peripheral nerve stimulators for the treatment of migraine headaches, and other forms of chronic head pain; however, they were so utilized with full recognition of the inherent risks and limitations given that they were developed only to address, and accommodate to, the unique anatomic and physiologic features of the back and chronic back pain. U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/865,893 describes the manifold problems associated with the application of spinal cord stimulators for head pain as fundamentally due to design flaws associated with, and inherent to, the use of an implantable therapeutic device in an area of the body that it was not designed for. Indeed, the anatomy of the head, and the pathophysiology of headaches, and other forms of head pain, are so significantly different from the anatomy of the spinal canal, and pathophysiology of chronic back pain, that when spinal cord stimulators are utilized for cranial implants, the clinical problems associated with these differences manifest themselves. Importantly, these well-documented problems are clinically very significant and include issues of patient safety and satisfaction, the risk of an inadequate, or suboptimal, therapeutic response; and issues with patient comfort and cosmetics; as well as a recognized increased risk of surgical complications and technical problems. These medical issues stem from the design of conventional leads and the IPG. Conventional lead designs include a relatively large diameter, a cylindrical shape, (often) inadequate length and the necessity of implanting the IPG in the torso and distant from the distal leads, and a number and disposition of the surface electrodes and active lead arrays that do not match the requirements. A cylindrical lead of relatively large diameter results in increased pressure on, and manifest tenting of, the overlying skin, particularly of the forehead. Because conventional leads are of inadequate length to extend from the head to the IPG implant site, commonly in the lower back, abdomen, or gluteal region, lead extensions are often employed, and there are attendant risks of infection, local discomfort, and cosmetic concerns. With respect to prior leads: 1) There is only a single array of electrodes, with common lead options including 4, 8, or 16 electrodes disposed over that single array; 2) The array is relatively short with most leads having an array of from 5-12 cm in length; 3) Within this single array, the individual electrodes are disposed uniformly with constant, equal inter-electrode distances. This results in the need to implant multiple (often four or more) of the conventional leads to adequately cover the painful regions of the head. There are several practical clinical outcomes that result from the use of prior leads for the treatment of chronic head pain. First, since they comprise a single, relatively short active array, the currently available leads provide therapeutic stimulation to only a single region of the head; that is, they can provide stimulation to only the frontal region, or a portion of the parietal region, or a portion of the occipital region. Therefore, if a patient has pain that extends over multiple regions, then multiple separate lead implants are required—basically one lead implant is required for each unilateral region. A great majority of patients with chronic headaches experience holocephalic pain; that is they experience pain over the frontal and parietal and occipital regions bilaterally. Therefore, commonly these patients will need 4 to 7 leads implanted to achieve adequate therapeutic results (2 or 3 leads on each side). Second, the need for multiple leads includes considerable added expense, and more importantly, added medical risk associated with adverse events attendant to the multiple surgical procedures. Such adverse events include an increased risk of infection, bleeding, and technical issues with the leads, e.g., lead fracture, lead migration, and local irritation. Third, as the clinical database discloses, the inter-electrode spacing may be of central therapeutic significance. That is, for example, whereas commonly pain over the occipital region is consistently effectively treated by quadripolar leads (leads with four evenly spaced electrodes) that have the electrodes relatively widely spaced apart (approximately a cm or more apart), clinically it is often found that electrodes configurations that are more narrowly spaced may be more effective over the supraorbital nerve and regions. Thus, a quadripolar lead that has the electrodes only 1-2 mm apart may be more effective in this region, as it allows for more precise control of the delivered electrical pulse wave delivery. Inter-electrode spacing is also of therapeutic significance. For example, whereas pain over the occipital region is commonly treated effectively by systems incorporating relatively widely-spaced quadripolar leads (four electrodes at approximately 1 cm or more intervals), more narrowly spaced contacts are often more effective over the supraorbital region. When an IPG implant designed for spinal cord stimulation systems is employed as a peripheral nerve stimulator for head pain, several outcomes result. First, the IPG is implanted at a considerable anatomic distance for the cranial lead implants. Indeed, the leads must pass from their distal cranial implant positions across the cervical region and upper back to the IPG implant location, which are most commonly in the lower back, lower abdomen, or gluteal region. The leads must cross multiple anatomic motion segments, including the neck and upper back and/or chest at a minimum, and commonly include the mid back, lower back and waist segments, as well. The simple motions of normal daily life produce adverse tension and torque forces on the leads across these motion segments, which in turn increases the risk of various outcomes, including lead migration and/or lead fracture. In addition, the relatively large size of a spinal cord stimulator IPG contributes to local discomfort, cosmetic concerns, and increased risk of infection that may become larger and harder to treat in proportion to the size of the IPG pocket. The present disclosure is directed to an implantable head-mounted unibody peripheral neurostimulation system that includes an IPG from which two neurostimulating leads extend to a length sufficient to allow for therapeutic neurostimulation unilaterally over the frontal, parietal and occipital regions of the head. The present disclosure addresses and effectively solves problems attendant to publically available leads. The most important of these is the fact that current leads can only adequately stimulate a single region of the head due to design element flaws associated with terminal surface electrode number and disposition. The disclosure additionally addresses and solves other problems inherent with the currently available leads, including problems with cosmetics and patient comfort, particularly over the frontal regions, due the uncomfortable pressure placed on the skin of the forehead, due the cylindrical shape and relatively large diameter of the distal portion of the lead. Finally, the lead of the present disclosure solves the currently available leads' problem of inadequate lead length to reach a gluteal location of the implantable pulse generator, which therefore necessitates the additional risk and expense of further surgery to implant lead extensions. In one aspect, the implantable, head-mounted, neurostimulation system for head pain is operable for implantation in the head, and to provide neurostimulation therapy for chronic head pain, including chronic head pain caused by migraine and other headaches, as well as chronic head pain due other etiologies. The peripheral neurostimulator system disclosed herein takes into account unique anatomic features of the human head, as well as the unique, or singular, features of the various pathologies that give rise to head pain, including migraine and other headaches, as well as other forms of chronic head pain. To date, all commercially available systems that have been clinically utilized for implantation as a peripheral neurostimulator system were actually originally designed specifically for placement in the epidural space, as part of a spinal cord stimulation system, for the therapeutic purpose of treating chronic back and/or extremity pain. Thus, there are currently no commercially available leads or fully system that have designs in the public domain, that have been designed and developed for use in the head and for head pain. In another aspect, the implantable, head-mounted, neurostimulation system for head pain comprises multiple design features, including disposition of a sufficient plurality of surface electrodes over a sufficient linear distance along the distal lead, such as will result in lead that, as a single lead, is capable of providing medically adequate therapeutic stimulation over the entire hemicranium; that is, over the frontal, parietal, and occipital region substantially simultaneously. Currently available systems, which were designed specifically for epidural placement for chronic back pain, are capable of only providing stimulation over a single region; that is over either the frontal region alone, or the parietal region alone, or the occipital region alone. In yet another aspect, the implantable, head-mounted, neurostimulation system for head pain comprises multiple design features, including the physical grouping of the extended array of surface electrodes into three or more discrete terminal surface electrode arrays. The linear layout of these two or more (preferably three or more) surface electrodes arrays is designed such that following implantation there would be at least one array positioned over the frontal region, at least one array positioned over the parietal region, and at least one array positioned over the occipital region. This feature further improves upon therapeutic effectiveness of the extended terminal surface electrode array sufficient for hemicranial stimulation by allowing for more precise control of the therapeutic neurostimulation parameters. In still another aspect, the implantable, head-mounted, neurostimulation system for head pain comprises multiple design features, including incorporating individual design features within each of the three or more individual surface electrode arrays; examples of such intra-array design features would include the specific number of electrodes allotted to each group; whether the electrodes are cylindrical or flattened; the width of each electrode within each array, and the linear distance intervals of separation of the electrodes within each array. This feature further improves upon therapeutic effectiveness of the extended terminal surface electrode array sufficient for hemicranial stimulation, and the grouping of these electrodes into three or more separate surface electrode arrays, by providing each specific array location a unique intra-array design that takes into account, and thereby seeks to optimizes, design elements that are known to be possibly or likely beneficial to the therapeutic end result, given the anticipated post-implant anatomic location of that array. In yet another aspect, the implantable, head-mounted, neurostimulation system for head pain comprises multiple novel design features, including incorporating individual design features into a single lead design and thereby achieving additive benefits. In still another aspect, an implantable, head-mounted, neurostimulation system for head pain results in a marked decrease in the number of separate lead implants required to adequately treat a single patient. A single implant will provide the same therapeutic anatomic coverage that it would take the implantation of three or four of the currently available leads; that is instead of the current which often calls for three or more leads to be implanted to provide adequate hemicranial coverage, the same anatomic region may be covered with a single stimulator lead implant. The lead provides extended coverage over the full hemicranium; that is achieving medically acceptable neurostimulation unilaterally over the frontal, parietal, and occipital regions simultaneously. In contrast, publically known leads are able to consistently provide medically acceptable neurostimulation therapy only over a single region; meaning that it would require three separate surgically placed lead implants to achieve the same therapeutic coverage of a single implant of a lead of the present disclosure. This will decrease the total number of surgeries required, as well as the extent of each individual surgery, for many patients. In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a system that is fully localized to the head, which obviates the requirement of currently available systems of having long leads and extensions extending across the neck and back to IPG locations commonly in the low back and gluteal region, and thereby decreases the risk of problems attendant to such long leads and extensions, including discomfort, infection, technical extension issues such as fracture, and other morbidities. This ultimately results in a decreased number of surgeries required by a patient. In other aspects the system may include one or more of the following features. A neurostimulating lead may not require a central channel for a stylet. A neurostimulating lead may have a smaller diameter than currently available leads. In other aspects the system may include one or more of the following features. The system may include the disposition of a sufficient plurality of surface electrodes over a sufficient linear distance along the system's leads to enable medically adequate therapeutic stimulation across multiple regions of the head, and preferably the entire hemicranium; that is, over the frontal, parietal, and occipital region simultaneously. The extended array of surface electrodes may be divided into two or more discrete terminal surface electrode arrays. The preferred linear layout of these multiple surface electrode arrays includes at least one array positioned over the frontal region, at least one array positioned over the parietal region, and at least one array positioned over the occipital region. In other aspects intra-array design features may include variations in the specific number of electrodes allotted to each group; the shape of the electrodes, e.g., whether the electrodes are cylindrical or flattened; the width of each electrode within each array, and the linear distance intervals of separation of the electrodes within each array. In other aspects, the system may a plurality of connection ports that can be connected with a plurality of leads and thus allow for attaching additional leads should they later be required. In another aspect, an implantable, head-mounted, neurostimulation system for head pain comprises multiple design features; including features aimed at improving patient safety by improving the incidence of adverse events, including the risk of infection, as well as the risk and incidence of known technical problems associated with implanted leads, including lead migration and lead fracture, amongst others. The lead may comprise two or more (i.e. three or more) surface electrode arrays, each uniquely designed, that are disposed over a sufficient lead length to allow for medically acceptable therapeutic neurostimulator coverage of at least regions within the supraorbital, parietal, and occipital cranial regions. To achieve the same clinical coverage from a single implant, it would require three or more separately surgically implanted leads. Therefore, by reducing the number of surgical incisions, as well as the number of surgically implanted leads, the associated risks of adverse events are proportionally diminished. In yet another aspect, an implantable, head-mounted, neurostimulation system for head pain may treat chronic head and/or face pain of multiple etiologies, including migraine headaches; and other primary headaches, including cluster headaches, hemicrania continua headaches, tension type headaches, chronic daily headaches, transformed migraine headaches; further including secondary headaches, such as cervicogenic headaches and other secondary musculoskeletal headaches; including neuropathic head and/or face pain, nociceptive head and/or face pain, and/or sympathetic related head and/or face pain; including greater occipital neuralgia, as well as the other various occipital neuralgias, supraorbital neuralgia, auriculotemporal neuralgia, infraorbital neuralgia, and other trigeminal neuralgias, and other head and face neuralgias. In other aspects, an implantable, head-mounted, neurostimulation system for head pain may not require a central channel for stylet placement over its distal (frontal) portions. The lead may improve patient comfort and cosmetics by virtue of its relatively small diameter over the distal portions of the lead, partially due the lack of a central stylet channel, as well as due to a progressive decrease in the number of internal wires continuing after each terminal electrode. The lead may further improve cosmetic appearance and patient comfort by incorporating a flattened lead design for that portion of the lead expected to be over the frontal portion of the head. Thus the present disclosure provides for a peripheral neurostimulation lead that is uniquely designed for implantation in the head as a therapy for chronic head pain, and is designed to solve the known design issues associated with current leads, as the lead of the present disclosure seeks to optimize the therapeutic response, improve patient comfort, improve cosmetics, reduce the number of surgical leads required, reduce medical risk, and reduce medical costs. B. Overview Turning now to the drawings, which depict the system and several of its components in various aspects and views, and in which similar reference numerals denote similar elements. The drawings illustrate an IPG from which two neurostimulating leads may extend to a length sufficient to allow for therapeutic neurostimulation unilaterally over the frontal, parietal and occipital regions. The leads include an extended plastic lead body; a plurality of surface metal electrodes disposed along the lead, which may be divided into two or more electrode arrays; a plurality of internal electrically conducting metal wires running along at least a portion of its length and individually connecting the IPG's internal circuit to individual surface metal electrodes. The implantable pulse generator includes a rechargeable battery, an antenna coil, and ASIC. The system may be operable to provide medically acceptable therapeutic neurostimulation to multiple regions of the head, including the frontal, parietal and occipital regions simultaneously, and three figures demonstrate various views of this feature as the lead is depicted in-situ. C. Full Head-Mounted Neurostimulator System FIG. 1 depicts a side view of a full neurostimulator system, which consists of an implantable pulse generator (IPG) 10 along with two unibody plastic lead extensions—a Fronto-Parietal Lead (FPL) 20 and an Occipital Lead (OL) 30 of adequate length to extend to roughly the midline of the forehead and to the midline at the cervico-cranial junction, respectively. FIGS. 5, 6 and 7 depict posterior, lateral and frontal views of the system in-situ. The unit is demonstrated in an implant position where the IPG 10 is posterior and cephalad to the pinna of the ear. The drawings demonstrate the FPL 20 passing over the parietal 60 and frontal 70 regions of the head in a manner that places the FEA over the supraorbital nerve and the PEA over the auriculotemporal nerve. The OL 30 is shown passing caudally and medially over the occipital region of the head 50 such that the OEA 35 cross over the greater occipital nerve 51, the lesser occipital nerve 52, and the third occipital nerve 53. D. Fronto-Parietal Lead Continuing with FIG. 1, the FPL as part of the unibody construction, extends from the IPG. The FPL comprises a plastic body member 20a and a set of internal conducting wires 29. The plastic body member 20a is an elongated, cylindrical, flexible member, which may be formed of a medical grade plastic polymer. It has a proximal end 22, a distal end 21, and may be conceptually divided into five segments along its linear dimension. Progressing from the proximal end 22, these segments sequentially include a proximal lead segment (PLS) 22a, a parietal electrode array (PEA) 26, an inter-array interval 27, a frontal electrode array (FEA) 25, and a distal non-stimulating tip 33. The lead internal wires 29 pass along the interior of the plastic body member as depicted in FIG. 4. E. Frontal Electrode Array Continuing with FIG. 1, the FEA 25 consists of a plurality of surface metal electrodes (SME) 24 uniformly disposed over a portion of the distal aspect of the FPL 20. Lead internal wires 29 connect to the SME 24 as depicted in FIG. 2, which represents the distal four SME 24 of the lead. F. Parietal Electrode Array Returning to FIG. 1, the PEA 26 consists of a plurality of SME 24 uniformly disposed along a linear portion of the FPL. The PEA 26 is separated along the FPL from the FEA by an inter-array interval 27. It is separated only the lead from the IPG by the PLS 22a. The lead internal wires 29 connect to the individual SME 24 of the PEA in the same fashion as the do with the SME of the FEA as shown in FIG. 2. G. Occipital Lead Continuing with FIG. 1, the occipital lead (OL) 30 as part of the unibody construction, extends from the IPG 10. It comprises a plastic body member 39 and a set of lead internal wires 38 that pass through the central cylinder of the lead to connect to a series of SME 37 that are uniformly disposed along a portion of the length of the lead. These lead internal wires 38 pass and connect in the same manner as described above for the SME 24 of the FEA 25 as depicted in FIG. 2 and FIG. 4. The plastic body member 39 is an elongated, cylindrical, flexible member, which may be formed of a medical grade plastic polymer. It has a proximal end 32 and a distal end 31. Progressing along the lead from the proximal end 32, these segments sequentially include a proximal lead segment (PLS) 32a, an occipital electrode array (OEA) 35, and a distal non-stimulating tip 33. H. Occipital Lead Array As depicted in FIG. 1, the OEA 35 consists of a plurality of surface metal electrodes (SME) 34 uniformly disposed over a portion OL 30. Lead internal wires 38 connect to the SME 24 in the same fashion as depicted for the FEA as shown in FIG. 2. I. Implantable Pulse Generator Referring to FIG. 1 and FIG. 3, the three primary physical and functional components of the IPG 10 include a rechargeable battery 12, an antenna 11, and an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) 13, along with the necessary internal wire connections amongst these related components, as well as to the incoming lead internal wires 29, 39. These individual components may be encased in a can made of a medical grade metal and plastic cover 24, which itself transitions over the exiting FPL 20 and OL 30. K. Connections of Main Elements and Sub-Elements The system may include a unibody construction to provide physical and functional continuity of the related components and sub-components. The overall mechanistic purpose of an implantable neurostimulation system is to generate and conduct a prescribed electrical pulse wave from an IPG 10 down a set of lead internal wires 29, 38 running a portion of the length of the lead to specified programmed set of SME 24, 34, whereby the current is then conducted by tissue and/or fluid to an adjacent, or nearby, set of one or more SME 24, 34, which in turn passes the signal proximally down the lead wire 29, 38 back to the IPG 10 and its ASIC 13, thus completing the circuit. L. First Embodiment The first embodiment provides for a lead that incorporates one or more of the features outlined above and includes a head-mounted, unibody neurostimulating system comprising an IPG 10 and at least two neurostimulating leads (FPL 20 and OL 30). The system may be implanted in a manner such that the IPG 10 and two leads 20, 30 are disposed as illustrated in FIG. 5, FIG. 6 and FIG. 7. The IPG 10 is capable of functionally connecting to and communicating with a portable programmer and an external power source for battery recharging. In this embodiment, the leads are constructed as described above and as depicted in the drawings. The FPL 20 is approximately 26 cm in length from its proximal end 22 to its distal end 21. The FPL 20 has a distal non-stimulating tip of approximately 3 mm in length that abuts the FEA, which may have ten SME 24 uniformly disposed over approximately 8 cm. This is followed by an inter-array interval 27 of approximately 4 cm, then the PEA, which may include eight SME 24 uniformly disposed over approximately 6 cm, and finally a proximal lead segment 22a that ends at the proximal end 22, where the lead transitions to the IPG 10 and the lead internal wires 29, 38 connect to the ASIC 13. In this embodiment, the occipital lead may comprise a plastic body member 39 over which six SME 34 may be disposed uniformly over approximately a 10 cm length of the lead, and the lead terminates in approximately a 3 mm distal non-stimulating tip 33. In this embodiment, the IPG 10 comprises the elements described above and depicted in the drawings, including an ASIC 13, a rechargeable battery 12, and an antenna 11, which all may be housed in a medical grade metal can with plastic cover 14. In this embodiment the dimensions of the IPG 10 measured along the outer surface of the plastic cover 14 may be approximately 5 cm by 3 cm by 0.5 mm. The system includes a portable programmer 40 and a portable recharging unit, both of which functionally couple to the IPG through a radiofrequency mechanism. In this embodiment, the system is capable of handling a program from the portable programmer 40 that includes such parameters as pulse amplitude, frequency and pulse width. M. Alternate Embodiments There are multiple alternate embodiments that preserve the features of the neurostimulation system disclosed herein, which include an externally rechargeable and programmable IPG, sized and configured for implantation in the head, and from which fronto-parietal and occipital leads, along with their respect surface metal electrode arrays, extend to cover multiple regions of the head. In various embodiments, the spacing and dimensions of the electrode array(s) may be constant, or the electrode arrays may be specifically designed with respect to electrode type, dimensions, and layout for improving the therapeutic effectiveness. Thus, the disclosure comprises extended electrode array designs (two or more regions by a single lead), and/or multiple arrays and optimized intra-array electrode dispositions. The disclosure also comprises lead configurations, which include the capability of a modular lead design that provides for ports on either the standard FPL and OLs. In another embodiment, the IPG receive additional separate leads, if and as necessary either at the time of initial implant or in the future. Further, the lead lengths, along with the specific technical makeup and dimensions of the individual surface metal electrodes and electrode arrays, may be varied to include more or less than three unilateral regions of the head (occipital, parietal, and frontal) contemplated by the first embodiment. For example, a single IPG may energize and control multiple additional leads of varying lengths that ultimately could be disposed over virtually every region of the head and face bilaterally. At least two electrodes may be included per region, and while the first embodiment calls for a total of 24 electrodes disposed over three arrays covering three different regions of the head—the occipital, parietal and frontal regions—there is no absolute limit to the maxim number of electrodes. Similarly, while the first embodiment calls for three electrode arrays, the disclosure contemplates two, or even one array (so long as the array covers at least two regions). There is also no limiting maximum for the number of arrays. Also, there may be multiple variations of design within each separate array, including for example, variations in the number, dimensions, shape, and metal composition of the individual electrodes, as well as the distance and constancy of distance between electrodes, within each array. Further, each array may have the same or completely different designs. While the neurostimulation system has been described for implantation as a peripheral neurostimulator in the head and for head pain, it is capable of being implanted and used as a peripheral nerve stimulator over other regions of the head and face than described above and also over other peripheral nerves in the body. N. Operation When functioning; that is when the internal circuit of lead internal wires is connected to an IPG; the SME of the various arrays are programmed to function as anodes and cathodes. The generated electrical pulse wave then passes from the ASIC of the IPG to the associated internal lead wire, and ultimately to its associated terminal surface metal electrode. The current then passes a short distance from the subcutaneous tissue to a contiguous, or nearby, electrode, whereby it passes back up the lead to its associated proximal metal contact, and then back to the IPG to complete the circuit. The generated pulse waves pass through the subcutaneous tissue between two terminal electrodes that stimulates the sensory nerves of the area. When active, the IPG may be programmed to produce continuous series of pulse waves of specified frequency, amplitude, and pulse width. It is this series of pulse waves actively stimulating a patient's locally associated nerves that underpins the therapeutic effect of the implanted unit. The electrical pulse wave then passes from a connected proximal surface metal contact, along the associated internal lead wire, and ultimately to its associated terminal surface metal contact.
