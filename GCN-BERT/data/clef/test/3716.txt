FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to orthopedic fixation devices comprising a rod and a bone screw having a variable angle head. The variable angle head of the bone screw has a coupling element that can independently lock the angulation of the head relative to the screw axis and securely prevent movement of the rod within the variable angle head. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Many types' of spinal irregularities can cause pain, limit range of motion, or injure the nervous system within the spinal column. These irregularities can result from, without limitation, trauma, tumor, disc degeneration, and disease. Often, these irregularities are treated by immobilizing a portion of the spine. This treatment typically involves affixing a plurality of screws and/or hooks to one or more vertebrae and connecting the screws or hooks to an elongate rod that generally extends in the direction of the axis of the spine. Treatment for these spinal irregularities often involves using a system of pedicle screws and rods to attain stability between spinal segments. Instability in the spine can create stress and strain on neurological elements, such as the spinal cord and nerve roots. In order to correct this, implants of certain stiffness can be implanted to restore the correct alignment and portion of the vertebral bodies. In many cases, an anchoring member such as a pedicle screw along with a vertical solid member can help restore spinal elements to a pain free situation, or at least may help reduce pain or prevent further injury to the spine. Some systems are directed toward immobilization of the vertebral bodies by implantation of bone screws, couplings, and elongate rods. Examples of such systems include U.S. Patent Nos. 5,690,630, 5,669,911, and 5,672,176. It is well known that difficulties can arise during a surgical procedure when attempting to connect a vertical solid member, such as a rod, to a bone screw. As a result, it may be desirable to use a variable angled coupling element to connect a rod to a bone screw. This lessens the need to modify the system, such as by bending the rod, by repositioning the screw, or the like. The coupling element acts as an elbow which can "'reach out" to the rod and allow for easier adjustment and installation of the rod in the patient. Typically, a conventional polyaxial screw described by the prior art often has a cap of some kind is used to compress the rod onto the coupling element. This compression of the rod enables the locking mechanism within the coupling element to fix the angle between the bone screw and said element. Therefore, the vertical compression of the rod is paramount in the design of the bone screw system. Conventional polyaxial screws also typically require that compression of the coupling element and the bone screw be achieved through the clamping of some form of taper within the coupling element. This is achieved usually by means of slits which are placed within the members of the coupling element. When these elements are placed in compression the tines created by the slits contract on the head of the screw by means of a cylindrical taper. In addition to the references mentioned above, additional examples of such systems requiring pressure from the rod to lock the position of the polyaxial screw head also can be found in U.S. Patent Nos. Re 37,665, 5,733,286, and 5,476,464. Some systems, such as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,248,105, describe the possibility of separately fastening the connecting body to the spherical head and elongated rod. While these designs may provide an advantage of reducing assembly time over earlier screw designs by requiring clamping of only one fastener to hold the rod and coupling element by applying pressure against the head of the bone screw, such systems lack the ability to separately lock or release one element, such as the rod or the coupling element. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Hence, the technical problem underlying the present invention is to provide a spine stabilization system allowing to overcome the drawbacks mentioned above with reference to the known art. Such problem is solved by the spine stabilization system according to the claims which follow. In particular, the present invention is directed towards an improved anchoring system using a polyaxial screw that is capable of independently affixing a coupling member to the screw head while also permitting an elongate rod to be held securely in a desired position. In general, the present invention may be used in a variety of spine stabilization systems. For instance, one embodiment has an elongate rod, a bone fastener having a rounded or semi-spherical head, and a coupling element comprising a skirt having an interior space for receiving the fastener head . The coupling element may be formed of one piece or may comprise a plurality of connectors. A plurality of stops are disposed on the coupling element and the plurality of connectors may be configured and adapted to slidingly communicate with a coupling ring having one or more arms extending toward the fastener. The arms of the coupling ring may be selectively engaged with the stops to lock the position of the skirt with respect to the position of the fastener. Some embodiments of the present invention further comprise a cap capable of engaging with a first end of the skirt and capturing the elongate rod within a recess, channel, or opening in the skirt when the cap is rotated to a first position relative to the skirt. In one embodiment, the cap is capable of rotating to first and second positions relative to the skirt. Rotation of the cap relative to the skirt may cause the cap to press the elongate rod toward the coupling ring so that the coupling ring arms apply pressure against the plurality of stops and lock the skirt in position relative to the bone fastener. In another embodiment, the cap comprises a locking element capable of securely holding the elongated rod in a fixed position relative to the skirt. The cap also may have a threaded opening and the locking element may be a threaded set screw disposed within the threaded opening. Preferably, the set screw is capable of applying downward pressure on the elongate rod to lock the elongate rod in position relative to the skirt. In still yet another embodiment of the invention, the cap and skirt may have at least one detent or protrusion and corresponding recess or depression that contact each other when the cap is in its second position to resist inadvertent loosening of the cap from the skirt. This feature may be particularly beneficial if a set screw or other locking element is used in the cap to selectively lock or unlock the elongate rod. Depending upon its configuration, rotation 15 of the cap toward to the first or second position may cause the detent and corresponding recess to provide a tactile or audible signal to the physician. In some embodiments, a plurality of detents and recesses may be provided for each predetermined position of the cap relative to the skirt. Thus, in one embodiment, rotation of the cap to a first position relative to the skirt causes the cap and skirt to provide a tactile or audible signal, such as a click, to 20 the physician. Moreover, in some embodiments rotation of the cap to a second position relative to the skirt results in a tactile or audible signal to the physician. In some embodiments, which do fall within the invention the cap comprises a sidewall having a first and second channel formed therein. The first and second channels may be wider than the diameter of the elongate rod so as to allow some rotation of the cap without obstruction by the elongated rod. In one embodiment, , which does fall within the invention the first and second channels are configured to permit the cap to rotate from 5° to 90° when in communication with the skirt without being impeded by the elongate rod. In yet another-embodiment, unimpeded rotation of the cap is from about 20° to about 40° when in communication with the skirt and with the elongate rod. The cap may be capable of rotating up to about 30° before reaching the first position. Moreover, the cap may be configured to provide a tactile or audible click when rotated to the first position. In addition, at least one channel in the cap sidewall may comprise a cammed upper edge that is capable of urging the elongate rod toward the coupling ring as the cap is rotated. Moreover, in one embodiment the skirt may have a plurality of threads capable of engaging with the cap and drawing the cap toward the elongate rod as the cap is rotated. Additionally, bone fastener head may be textured with helical grooves or have some other textured surface. In one embodiment, , which does fall within the invention a coupling body component has a first textured surface and a second textured surface, and the first and second textured surfaces contact the rounded head when the coupling element is locked to the rounded head. In still other embodiments , which do fall within the invention, the spine stabilization system has an elongate rod, a bone fastener having a securing element and a rounded head, and a coupling element. The coupling element may have a lower clamp element disposed on a first end of said head proximal to said securing element, said lower clamp comprising a seating surface corresponding approximately to receive a portion of the rounded surface of said head. One embodiment which is not part of the invention, further includes the upper clamp element disposed on a second end of said head distal to said securing element. In some cases, the lower clamp and upper clamp may have a projection and a notch that can interconnect to restrict rotation of one clamp with respect to the other. Moreover, the system may also have a locking element disposed substantially around said first and second clamp elements. The locking element also may further have an interior surface that is at least partially threaded. In some embodiments, the threaded portion of said locking element may be selectively engaged with said threaded portion of said lower clamp. These embodiments may also have a rod locking element in communication with the upper clamp and locking element. Preferably, the rod locking element comprises a seating surface for receiving said elongate rod. As discussed above, a locking cap may be selectively engaged with said rod locking element to secure said elongate rod to said coupling element. In still yet another embodiment within the present invention, the system may have a bone fastener having a rounded head and a coupling element. In this embodiment, the first end of the coupling element may have a skirt disposed over said rounded head, wherein said skirt comprises a slit extending from a portion of the skirt proximal to the bone fastener toward a distal end of said skirt, and wherein each of said distal and proximal ends of said skirt has one or more stops. The coupling ring may be disposed over said distal end of said skirt, wherein said coupling ring comprises one or more arms extending from said coupling ring to the proximal end of said skirt, and wherein said arms may be selectively engaged with said stops to lock said coupling element to said head. Once again, a locking cap may be selectively engaged with said coupling element to lock said elongate rod to said coupling element.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally is directed toward a spinal fixation system whereby the locking of an elongate rod plays may not be necessary in order to lock the angle between a fastener, such as a screw, and a coupling element. Instead of requiring full application of locking pressure on an elongated rod in order to lock the coupling element securely in place with respect to the screw head, some embodiments of the present invention utilize a coupling locking device that is capable of securing the coupling element to the screw independent of the rod or with forces imparted by the rod that are less than the forces used to lock the rod in place. Likewise, some embodiments of the present invention also may utilize a rod locking device that is capable of securing the rod to the coupling element in a manner that is independent of the coupling locking device. In addition, some embodiments of the present invention permit a coupling element to lock in place relative to the fastener head by downward movement of the elongated rod. Once the coupling element is locked, the rod may be moved upward or repositioned without causing the coupling element to unlock or come loose. Thus, unlike prior spine stabilization systems, many embodiments of the present invention permit separately locking or unlocking of either the rod and coupling element or the coupling element and screw. As explained by the examples and illustrations below, the coupling locking device and the rod locking device can be configured and adapted in several different ways while still allowing independent operation or independent locking. Through the means of cams, wedges, or threads, this invention can place a compression on the head of the screw without use of the elongated rod. The invention further seeks to reduce the number of steps in the procedure, reduce the size of the coupling element, and reduce the number of separate pieces associated with the implant. This will reduce intra operative time, create less complicated procedures, and work well in a wider variety of patient anatomy. While many features of the invention will be described more fully below with reference to the accompanying drawings illustrating several embodiments of the invention, it is to be understood at the outset that skilled artisans having the benefit of this disclosure may recognize further variations or modifications of the invention that may also achieve the functions and results of this invention. Accordingly, the descriptions which follow are to be understood as illustrative and exemplary of specific structures, aspects, and features within the broad scope of the invento.11 and not as limiting of such broad scope. Each of the embodiments described below and in the associated figures describes a polyaxial fastener having a screw and coupling element assembly for use with an orthopedic rod implantation apparatus. While the embodiments are described and illustrated as having a screw that has a head and a shaft that extends from the head, it should be understood that other fasteners or securing elements may also be used such as, for example. lamina hooks and sacral blocks. Thus, the present invention may be used with a wide variety of fasteners or securing elements in addition to a bone screw as described herein. Accordingly, FIG. 1 illustrates a side view of a screw 20 suitable for use in the invention. The screw 20 includes a head 22 and a shaft 24 that extends from the head 22. The shaft 24 is shown as having a tapered shape, which may be configured with a high pitch thread, although once again, skilled artisans would recognize that other shaft designs also would be compatible with the invention. Thus, the physician is free to select from a variety of shaft features, such as thread pitch, shaft diameter to thread diameter ratio, overall shaft shape, and the like according to the conditions of the individual patient's bone. While the head 22 may have any rounded shape, it is preferred that the head has a tapered neck with a rounded head to provide increased adjustability. Thus, at least a portion of the head may be shaped to form a portion of a ball or at least a portion of a sphere above the neck in order to allow for rotational or angular adjustment of the coupling element 26 with respect to the fastener 20. This preferred configuration also allows the coupling element 26 to more securely grip the head 22. In other words, at least a portion of the head 22 has a curved surface from which the shaft extends. The curved portion of the head can be a semi-spherical in shape, exhibiting an external contour that is equidistant from a center point of the head. In addition, the head may have an engagement surface that can be engaged by a screw driving tool or other device, it is preferable that the engagement surface does not disrupt the functionality of the curved surface. The diameter of the head 22 may be approximately the same as the largest diameter of the shaft 24. The neck may be tapered to provide greater curvature of the head 22 in order to provide a greater variety of angles and positions in which the coupling body and screw or fastener may be arranged. It should be noted that in other embodiments, the diameter of the shaft 24 can be less than or greater than the diameter of the head 22, and the neck may be untapered or differently tapered. The head 22 also may have an engagement surface that permits the physician to apply torsional or axial forces to the screw with a wrench or screw driving tool to drive the screw into the bone. For instance, the engagement surface of the head 22 may be a polygonal recess as shown in FIGS. 11 and 21 in which the head of a tool can engage. For example, the head 22 may have a hexagonal recess that receives a hexagonal tool such as an allen wrench. The engagement surface also may be configured with a protruding engagement surface that likewise may engage with a tool or device having a corresponding recess, although preferably the protruding engagement surface would not significantly interfere with the capability to vary the angle of the coupling element with respect to the screw 20. The engagement surface may have other shapes as well, such as a slot or a cross found typically used with other types of screwdrivers. Prior to being locked into place, a coupling element 26 associated with the head 22 can be moved and rotated into a plurality of positions. The coupling element is configured and adapted with a seat or interior surface that receives the head 22 on a first end and an elongated rod on the opposing end. At least a portion of the head may have a roughened or textured surface that improvise engagement between it and other component of the polyaxial screw when in a locked or tightened position. With respect to the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the coupling element comprises a coupling ring 28 and a coupling body. The coupling body has a skirt 32 that defines the seat or interior surface that receives the head 22. Preferably, the skirt may be selectively locked or unlocked against the head by providing one or more slits or openings that allow the seat or interior surface of the coupling element to constrict and securely engage with the head 22 in a locked position or be expanded or unlocked as desired. In one embodiment, shown in FIG. 1, the coupling body has one or more generally helical slits. More preferably, the slits or openings extend from a free end of the skirt proximate to the screw or fastener 20 to a location above the head 22. The coupling body has a plurality of stops 34, preferably disposed near the upper and lower ends of the coupling body skirt 32. The stops 34 may be configured with flanges with openings or slots through which the coupling ring may be placed so that the skirt 32 approximates the shape of a spool. The stops 34 are positioned so that as the coupling ring 25 28 is connected to the coupling body torsional forces are applied to the skirt 32 causing it to twist and constrict against the head 22. As shown in FIG. 1, the coupling ring 28 is configured to have one, two, or more arms 36 that extend from the ring 28 and engage with the stops 34. As the coupling ring 28 is placed onto the coupling body, the arms 36 slidably engage with the stops with minimal torsional forces imparted to the skirt until a wedge near the base of the arms proximal to the ring contacts one of the stops. After the wedge has engaged with one of the stops, further insertion of the ring over the coupling body will cause it to turn about the longitudinal axis of the skirt. As the ring is turned, the distal end of the arms will engage with stops 34 and apply torsional forces to the skirt. In one embodiment, the locking ring rotates from about 2° to about 15° from its initial, unlocked position until reaching a locked position where the coupling element is immovably secured to the screw. In another embodiment, the locking ring rotates from about 5° to about 10° from an unlocked to a locked position. Preferably, the distal end of the ring arms 36 are configured to radially engage with a lip on the skirt once the skirt has been sufficiently turned to lock against the screw head 22. As shown in FIG. 2, for example, the distal end of the ring arm may have protrusions 38 that extend radially inward. The protrusions 38 can slide over the lip of the skirt and snap into place once the skirt is in its locked position. Initially, when the skirt is not in a locked position the length of the ring arms Lra from the proximal end to the protrusion may be less than the length of the skirt Ls. As the skirt is twisted∼ however, its overall length may gradually decrease, and the ring arms will splay outward as the protrusions are forced over the lip. Once the length of the skirt Ls becomes approximately the same length or shorter than the length of the ring arms Lra, the protrusions will be released over the lip and hold the skirt in its locked position. In this embodiment, unlocking the coupling body skirt 32 from the screw head 22 can be accomplished by applying a radially outward force to the ring arms until the protrusions no longer engage with the lip. Once the protrusions are clear of the lip, the coupling ring may be rotated to unlock the coupling element. In this manner, the coupling element may be selectively locked or unlocked to the screw or fastener 20 without requiring the elongated rod to be locked in position. Thus, no forces need be imparted by the elongated rod to lock the coupling element to the screw or fastener. Returning to FIG. 1, the coupling body also is configured and adapted to receive an elongated rod on an upper end opposite the end of the coupling body configured with the coupling body skirt 32. Preferably, this portion of the coupling body is configured with a U-shaped or wedge shaped seat against which the elongate rod will be locked. Substantially rigid tines or wedges extend upward from the seat for the rod, which are configured with slots or detents that receive a cap 40. The cap, such as illustrated in FIG. 3 and 17, may have corresponding protrusions or slots that permit the cap to engage with and rotate with respect to the coupling body. In one embodiment, rotation of the cap causes it to move downward and toward the screw, thereby applying a downward force against the elongate rod to hold it securely in place. In another embodiment, the cap applies a downward pressure on the elongate rod that, in turn, causes the coupling element to be locked in position relative to the fastener while not completely locking the elongate rod in position. A set screw disposed in the cap may then apply additional downward pressure on the elongate rod to hold it firmly in position. Thus, in some embodiments the downward pressure of the cap on the rod may be sufficient to lock one component of the system while still allowing adjustability of the other component. In an another alternative embodiment, the tines or wedges of the coupling body that extend upward from the seat for the rod may be flexible so that they bend or flex around the rod as the cap is turned toward a locking position. For instance, either the cap, the tines or wedges, or both may be configured to have a tapered or ramped surface that causes gradually increasing radial interference with the cap and coupling element as the cap is rotated. As the radial forces resulting from this interference increases, the tines or wedges may bend or flex radially inward and press against the elongate rod. One or more detents and depressions may to be placed on either the side of the coupling body to hold the cap in a locked position by engaging with each other at a desired cap position. Rotation of the cap in the opposite direction likewise causes the elongated rod to become unlocked. Thus, in several embodiments of the invention the elongate rod may be selectively locked or unlocked in place without requiring the coupling body to be unlocked from its position with respect to the screw. FIGS. 3-8 illustrate several features and variations of another embodiment which is not part of the invention but which is helpful for understand it. Several features of this embodiment are similar to those described above. For example, the screw or fastener 20 may be configured or varied according to the physician's preference. It has a head 22 on which a coupling element 26 communicates. As mentioned above, the head 22 may be generally spherical in shape. The coupling element 26 may be positioned and rotated in several directions, and may be selectively locked or unlocked in position. The coupling element likewise has a coupling body and coupling ring 28 with ring arms 36 that is capable of locking the coupling element 26 to the screw or fastener 20. Rather than using a skirt that twists or rotates to lock the coupling element to the screw or fastener, however, the coupling body of this embodiment may be formed of one, two, or more coupling body components 42 that are configured with at least two stops that slidably engage with at least one ring arm 36. As shown in FIG. 5, the coupling body has at least one slit or opening extending substantially along the length of the coupling body component. More preferably, at least one slit or opening extends entirely along the length of the coupling body component, as shown for example in FIGS. 5 and 7. In one embodiment, the number of slits or opening configured in this manner increases as the number of coupling body components 42 increases. Thus, a coupling body comprising at least two coupling body components 42 also will have at least two slits or openings extending generally along the axial length of the coupling body components. The slit or opening is thus defined by corresponding terminating edges of material formed on or more coupling body components 42. As shown in FIGS. 5 and 7, the shape of the slit or opening may be configured such that a portion of a first terminating edge may protrude into a recessed area of a corresponding portion of a second terminating edge. As mentioned previously, at least two stops 34 are configured to slidably engage with at least one ring arm 36. These stops are positioned so that as the tapered portions of the ring arms contact one or more of the stops the terminating edges defining the slit or opening are forced toward each other so that the coupling element can be locked to the head of the screw or fastener. This is accomplished by placing at least one stop on each side of the terminating edges defining the slit or opening. Thus, each ring arm may communicate with two or more stops. More preferably, at least three stops are configured to contact at least one ring arm in order to close the coupling body onto the head 22. Thus, one edge of the slit or opening may have two or more stops, while the other may have one or more stops. Even more preferably, each ring arm is configured to communicate with at least three stops arranged in this manner. As shown in FIGS. 3, 5, and 6A, the terminating edges or the coupling body components 42 may be configured in a tongue and groove fashion so that the tapered surface of the ring arm contacts the stops on the trailing edge of the stop rather than at the leading edge. It is not necessary, however, that the terminating edges have this configuration. FIGS. 6B-D, for instance, illustrate some variations of this embodiment that do not utilize a tongue and groove configuration. More particularly, FIG. 6B illustrates that multiple wedges may be provided on the r:16 alms 36. This allows stops to be placed in different locations along the axial length of the coupling body, such as to allow the application of different amounts of gripping force on different portions of head 22. FIG. 6C shows that the stops may be angled in a manner that helps encourage the terminating edges closer together as the ring arms 36 are moved toward a locking position. For instance, the angle of the stops may be from about 3° to about 15° off from the longitudinal axis of the coupling element 26, and more preferably the stops may be angled from about 5° to about 10°. The embodiment of FIG. 6D uses a plurality of slits or openings that generally are perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the coupling element 26. These slits or openings create an appearance of generally horizontal bands. Stops disposed near free ends of one or more horizontal bands may slidingly engage with the ring arms as they are moved toward a locking position, thereby causing the terminating surfaces of the horizontal bands to move toward each other to grip the head 22. Locking mechanisms may be used in any of the embodiments described herein to hold the ring arms onto the coupling body in a locked position. As mentioned above, many different types of forces, such as torsional loading around or axial loading along the longitudinal axis of the coupling element 26, may be applied to the coupling ring 28 and ring 5 arms 36 in order to lock the coupling element in position. The embodiments shown in FIGS. 6A-D, for example, have locking mechanisms disposed on the free ends of one or more ring arms. The coupling element 26 may have a seat for receiving an elongated rod, and further may have tines that engage with a cap to independently lock the coupling element to an elongated rod. In some embodiments, the coupling element may be securely positioned with respect to the fastener head with little or no additional pressure applied to the head 22. For example, the cap may provide pressure to the sides of the tines on the coupling element, which in turn flex or bend to securely grip the elongated rod. FIGS. 9-12 illustrate an embodiment which is not part of the invention that does not utilize a coupling ring with ring arms applying forces to stops in order to cause the coupling element to flex or bend around the head 22. Instead, this embodiment uses a multiple piece threaded lock to clamp the coupling element to the fastener 20. For example, FIG. 9 illustrates a coupling element formed from a lower clamp element 44, an upper clamp element 46, a threaded locking nut 48, and' an elongated rod locking nut 50. FIG. 11 illustrates the assembly of the polyaxial screw of this embodiment of the invention. During assembly, the upper clamp element 46, elongated rod locking nut 50, and threaded locking nut 48 are positioned over the head 22 of the fastener 20 that is distal to the screw shaft 24. The lower clamp element 44 then is placed onto the head 22 by passing the screw head through its open center. The lower clamp element 44 preferably has threads that engage with the threads of the threaded locking nut 48. As these threads are increasingly engaged, the upper and lower clamp elements 44 and 46 gradually clamp onto the head 22 until the coupling element is securely in place. FIG. 9 shows that the interface between the upper and lower clamp elements may be engaged in a manner that prevents rotation of the clamp elements as the threaded locking nut is turned. In one embodiment, the upper and lower clamp elements utilize corresponding square tooth patterns on the clamping elements. Other patterns also may be used for the interconnecting surfaces, such as a sawtooth, a ratchet, or the like. The edges also may have roughened surfaces, such as a star grind, to help prevent rotation of the clamp elements, although it is more preferred that the interlocking surfaces of larger dimensions be used in order to ensure that the surfaces interconnect and resist rotation. The elongated rod may be locked in place by turning the elongated rod locking washer or nut so that the tines of the coupling element flex or bend to grip the rod. As shown in FIG. 9, the tines may be formed on the upper clamp. In this embodiment a cap as previously described for locking the elongated rod in place mayor may not be present. For example, the elongated rod locking washer may have one or more cams on its internal surface that urges the tines to bend or flex tightly around the elongated rod when the washer is turned or rotated. Preferably, turning the washer from about S° to about 25° causes the elongated rod to be either locked or unlocked. More preferably, the washer can be turned from about 10° to about 25°. If desired, a cap may be provided to further ensure that the rod is securely held in place. A set screw may also be provided in the cap to apply additional locking forces to the elongated rod. FIGS. 13 and 14 illustrate another embodiment which is not part of the invention that once again uses a coupling body skirt with slots or openings formed therein. In this embodiment, the coupling body skirt may be angled by from about 5° to about 30°, and more preferably is from about 7° to about 15°. While the figures illustrate that the taper of the coupling element gradually expands the diameter of the tapered portion of the coupling body skirt 32 from the end proximate the screw shaft 24 to the upper end near the elongated rod, skilled artisans would appreciate that the taper could be inverted. A locking ring 52 disposed around the coupling body skirt is capable of causing the coupling element to clamp securely to the fastener 20 simply by moving it in an axial direction along a tapered surface of the coupling body skirt 32. One advantage of this embodiment over the embodiments of FIGS. 9-11 is that there is no need to apply a wrench to a threaded locking nut. Additionally, in this embodiment the coupling body may be formed from only two elements instead of four. Thus, this embodiment may be advantageous over other embodiments at least for it simplicity of operation and design. In operation, once the coupling element is in a desired position, the locking ring 52 may be moved vertically along the axis of the coupling body skirt. As the ring is moved, it engages with and compresses the tapered region of the skirt, which in turn causes the skirt to flex and bend toward the head 22. Although not shown, a second ring may be provided on the skirt to help independently lock the elongated rod to the coupling body. This can be accomplished, for instance, by providing tines that reach above the elongated rod after the rod has been positioned within a seat of the coupling element. In much the same manner as described above for locking the coupling element 26 to the fastener 20, the second locking ring can be moved along the axis of a second tapered coupling body skirt that is configured and adapted for locking the elongated rod. It may be advantageous to configure the first and second tapered skirts and locking rings so that the direction of movement for moving one locking ring into a locked position would cause the second locking ring to move into an unlocked position if moved in the same direction. In other words, for this embodiment it may be advantageous to configure the coupling element so that locking of all components of the polyaxial screw is effected by either moving the locking rings far apart or by moving them toward each other. Another alternative for locking the elongated rod is to use a cap 40. Any cap design for locking an elongated rod, including those already described herein, may be used to securely connect the elongated rod with the coupling element. In general, the embodiments described above may be used to establish a substantially rigid, immobilization of at least a portion of the spine. In some cases, however, it may be advantageous to use a system that allows for some flexible support for at least a portion of the spine. The embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 15 and 16 does not describe one aspect of the invention but are disclosed for a better understanding thereof. In this embodiment the fastener 20 is capable of flexing or bending even after the components have been secured together. Although not required in order to practice the invention, in a preferred embodiment, the fastener and coupling element may be integrally formed. The coupling element may have one or more slits or openings that provide limited range of flexibility. For instance, the coupling elements may be configured to permit from about 2° to about 7° of flex. To provide this flexibility, the coupling element may be formed from one or more slits or openings formed in its surface. In one embodiment, the slits or openings in the coupling element are generally helical in shape. Other flexible constructions also may be used. For instance, U.S. Patent Application No. 10443,755, filed May 23, 2003, provides several methods and constructions for a flexible coupling element that may be used in the present invention. In addition, U.S. Patent Application No. 10/762,533, filed January 23, 2004 provides additional methods and constructions that may be used with the present invention. A seat for receiving the elongated rod may also be integrally formed into the fastener, although once again such a construction is not required in order to practice the invention. The seat may be formed from a plurality of tines in the manner previously described, or alternatively may have a threaded surface in which a locking cap 54 is placed over the rod. As the locking cap is turned, its lower surface presses against the upper surface of the elongated rod until the rod is securely held in place. FIGS. 17-19 illustrate another embodiment which is not part of the invention using a multiple piece threaded locking nut to clamp the coupling element 26 to the fastener 20. As shown in FIG. 17, the coupling element 26 comprises a lower clamp element 44, an upper clamp element 46, a threaded locking nut 48. The upper and lower clamp elements 44 and 46 have interconnecting edges that, when joined, help prevent rotation of one clamp element with respect to the other. As shown in FIG. 17, for example, the interconnected edges of the upper and lower clamp elements 44 and 46 may have an interconnecting pattern of teeth. Skilled artisans would recognize that other interconnecting edge patterns also may be used to help prevent rotation of the clamp elements with respect to each other. A portion of the lower clamp element 44 is threaded on its outer surface in order to receive corresponding threads on the inner surface of the threaded locking nut 48. Tightening of the threaded locking nut 48 causes the upper and lower clamp elements 44 and 46 to move 15 towards each other in order to lock the coupling body onto the head 22. The upper and lower clamp elements 44 and 46 have seating surfaces that conform to a portion of the curved surface of the fastener head 22. Preferably, the radius of curvature of the rounded or semi-spherical portion of the head 22 is the substantially the same as the radius of curvature for the seating surfaces of the upper and lower clamp elements. Once the 20 clamp elements have fully contacted the head 22, however, a gap or opening may remain between the upper most or lower most regions of the interconnecting edges. For instance, the space between the uppermost edge of an upwardly extending square tongue of the lower clamping element 44 and the uppermost edge of a corresponding square groove of the upper clamping elements may be from about .1 mm to about 5 mm in height. While the upper clamp element 46 has a lower edge that interconnects with the edge of the lower clamp, it also has an upper edge on the distal end from the interconnecting edge that engages with other elements of the coupling body to form a seat that receives the elongated rod. In particular, the distal end of the upper clamp element 46 extends above the threaded locking nut 48 and through an aperture formed in a rod seating and locking element 58 disposed above the threaded locking nut 48. The rod seating and locking element 58 has a curved seating surface that receives the elongated rod, but also is configured with a recess 60 to receive the distal end of the upper clamp element 46. In particular, the distal end of the upper clamp 46 has two or more wings 56 that extend radially outward from the distal end of the clamp. As shown in FIG. 17, the threaded locking nut 48 and rod seating and locking element 58 are notched to permit the wings 56 to pass through them when the wings are aligned with the notches. Once the wings are disposed above the seating surface of the rod seating and locking element 58, either the upper clamp 46 or the locking element 58 may be rotated until the recess 60 is aligned with the wings 56. The wings 56 are then placed within the recess 60 to form the seating surface on which the elongated rod will be placed. Once the elongated rod is positioned over the seating surface of the locking element 58 and the wings 56 of the upper clamping element 46, a locking cap 62 may be joined with the locking element 58 to securely connect the coupling element 26 to the rod. The manner in which the cap 62 and locking element 58 apply a locking force on the elongated rod may vary. In one embodiment, the locking cap is configured to apply a downward force on the elongated rod as it is joined with the locking element 58. As shown in FIG. 17. the locking element 58 may have one or more tabs that engage with the cap 62 to move the cap downward upon the rod. Referring to FIG. 19, the cap may have a curved ridge or tooth 66 extending along a portion of the circumference of the cap on its interior surface. The length of the curved ridge 66 may be determined in part upon the amount or rotation the cap will undergo when moving from an unlocked position to a locked position over the elongated rod. For instance, one or more curved ridges may extend from about 3° to about 30° of the cap. and more preferably extends from about 100 to about 20°. The curved ridge 66 engages with the underside of the tab 64. Either the curved ridge 66, the tab 64. or both may be configured to create a cammed surface that forces the cap downward as it is rotated toward a locked position. The tab and ridge also may be configured with one or more detents and recesses that are capable of providing a tactile or audible signal to the physician, such as click that may be felt or heard, of when the cap has reached its locked position. The detents and recesses also may assist in maintaining the cap in its locked position. Referring to FIG. 17. in a preferred embodiment the locking element 58 has an outer surface 68 below the tabs 64 that is generally cylindrical in shape. The cap 62 likewise has a corresponding generally cylindrical surface 70 of similar diameter. When the cap is placed over the locking element, these two surfaces may help maintain radial positioning of the cap 62 relative to the locking element 58 as the cap is turned toward a locking position. In one alternative embodiment, the locking element 58 and cap 62 may be configured compress a portion of the seating surface around the rod to lock it in place in a manner similar to FIGS. 9 and 14. Thus, this alternative embodiment may involve modifying the generally cylindrical surfaces 68 and 70 to create a cammed surface that applied radially inward forces upon a portion of the locking element. As the cap 62 is rotated toward a locking position, the radial forces increase and cause a portion of the locking element 58 to 5 flex, bend, and compress the elongate rod. As shown in FIGS. 17-19, the cap of this embodiment may have a sidewall 72 that extends from the top of the cap 62 toward the screw shaft 24. Preferably the cap sidewall 72 terminates near a lip or base of the locking element 58, and both elements are configured to have approximately the same outer diameter. In order to place the cap over the elongated rod the sidewalls 72 may have cutouts or notches 74 that permit the rod to extend through the sidewall 72 when the cap is placed over the locking element 58 in either a locked or unlocked position. Thus, the length of the cutouts or notches generally correspond to the amount of rotation needed to move the cap into or out of a locked position. The cutouts 74 also may be slightly larger than needed to rotate the cap 62 in order to allow for possible tolerances in the design of the cap 62, the locking element 58, and the rod. For instance, the cutouts 74 may permit from about 10 to about 50 of additional rotation than needed to lock or unlock the cap 62. Several of the features or elements of the various embodiments described herein may be modified and/or used with other embodiments of the invention. FIGS. 20-25 illustrate yet another embodiment which is not part of the invention that uses several features or elements described above. FIGS. 20-24 show how the components of this embodiment may be configured, arranged, and assembled. As shown in FIG. 21, for instance, the coupling element 26 may be formed of a coupling body and coupling ring. The coupling body may have one, two, or more coupling body components with at lest one, preferably two, slits or openings extending substantially, if not completely, along the axial length of the coupling body. The slits or openings need not be straight, but rather may be defined by the terminating edges of material on the coupling body components 42. FIGS. 20, 23 and 24 illustrate that the terminating edges of the coupling body components may be configured with a tongue and groove configuration. Likewise, a single coupling body component such as shown in FIGS. 7 and 8 may be used in place of a plurality of coupling body components. Likewise, the terminating edge may define a first substantially horizontal protrusion disposed above a second substantially horizontal protrusion defined by the opposing terminating edge so that the first and second protrusions are substantially layered or sandwiched together. Stops may be disposed on the coupling body components near each slit. At least one stop may be provided on opposite sides of the slit or opening. Thus, where the illustrated example uses two coupling body components, there are at least two stops on both components. The coupling body components may be disposed around the rounded fastener head. Subsequently, a ring may be pressed or lowered downward over the coupling body components. As the ring is lowered, one or more arms slidingly engage with the stops. Further downward movement of the ring and arms may then cause the coupling body components to securely grip the fastener head. FIG. 24 illustrates that the arm may define a wedge shape that pushes the stops on the coupling body components further apart from each other, which in turn causes the components to apply greater gripping force upon the fastener head. Skilled artisans would appreciate, however, that other configurations of stops may also be used to securely grip the fastener head, including any of the other configurations previously described above. For instance, the configurations illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 6B-E may also be utilized to push the stops closer together in order to increase the gripping forces applied to the fastener head. Turning to FIG. 24, the coupling body components may be configured to join together to grip the screw head. In this embodiment, a first coupling body component may have two prongs or arms on each side that extend outward to define a recess therebetween. The second coupling body component may then be configured with one arm on each side that corresponds generally to the recesses formed in the first component. The interior surfaces of the coupling body components may be roughened or textured to more securely grip the screw head. As shown, the interior surfaces may be textured with a plurality of grooves or circular cuts. The interior surfaces of both components may have similar textured formed thereon, or alternatively may have different textures or texture orientations. For instance, the grooves or circular cuts on one interior surface may be oriented in one direction, such as being directed generally horizontally, while grooves or cuts on a second interior surface may be oriented in a different direction, such as vertically, so that the angle formed between the direction of the grooves or cuts of the first surface and the direction of the grooves or cuts of the second surface is from about 60° to about 90°. In one embodiment, the gripping pressure applied to the fastener head causes the raised portions of the surfaces having grooves to deform or cut into an opposing grooved surface, thereby further resisting unintended movement or repositioning of the components. Additionally, helical grooves may be provided on either a portion of the fastener head, on a gripping surface of one or more coupling elements, or both. Once the coupling body component are place around the screw head, ring arm 36 may be place over the coupling element so that downward extending arms of the ring arm begin to engage with the stops to hold the coupling body components onto the screw head. In addition, the coupling body components and screw head may be lowered into the skirt. Turning to FIG. 25, the lower portion of the skirt may have a lip or retaining ring that is capable of supporting the fastener and assembled components disposed around its head. The lip may be a unitary surface extending inward around the entirety of the perimeter of the lower portion of the skirt, or alternatively may be formed of a plurality of tabs or protrusions that cooperate to prevent the assembled components from passing through the lower end of the skirt. The portion of the fastener head and assembly that rests against the lip may be shaped or configured to distribute the axial loading placed on the lip in substantially equal portions. In one embodiment, the surface of the lip that contacts the assembly is substantially flat and resides in a plane that is perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the skirt. The shape of the contacting surface of the lip may have other shapes as well, such as a frustoconical shape, a partially spherical shape, a sawtooth or ridged shape such as illustrated in FIG. 9, or the like. Above the lip, the skirt has a recess formed therein where the assembly may be placed. The ring arm may then be disposed over the assembly in the manner described above. The ring arm is configured with a curved seating surface on its upper side that is shaped to receive an elongate rod. The skirt also has two openings or slots on its upper side for receiving the elongate rod. As the rod is fitted through the opening or slots on the skirt and pressed on the ring arm seating surface, the ring arm may be urged further down, thereby causing the coupling element to close further upon the screw head. The forces applied on the screw head, however, may not yet fully prevent the skirt and assembly from being rotated, moved, or adjusted. A cap may then be lowered onto the skirt over the rod. The cap may have two enlarged openings or slots that are wider than the opening of the skirt and wider than the diameter of an elongated rod that may be placed in the skirt. This embodiment permits the cap to be turned or rotated without the sidewalls of the openings or slots from being obstructed by the rod. Preferably, the openings or slots are configured to permit from about 5° to about 90° of rotation of the cap, or alternatively permit from about 15° to about 60° of rotation of the cap. In yet another embodiment, the openings or slots in the cap are configured to permit from about 20°to about 40° of rotation of the cap without being obstructed by the rod. When the cap is turned to a first position, it engages with the skirt to prevent its inadvertent removal. In this position, the rod may remain free to be moved or slide through the openings of the skirt and cap, and the skirt may still be adjusted or moved relative to the screw or fastener. As the cap is turned further to a second position, however, a cam or inclined surface on the upper portion of the enlarged openings or slots may urge the rod further downward onto the ring arm, thereby causing the ring arm and coupling body components to securely grip the fastener head so that the skirt can no longer move relative to the screw or fastener. As mentioned above, the locking of the coupling body components in this manner may not also cause the cap to fully lock the elongated rod to the skirt. In fact, once the coupling body is locked onto the fastener head, the cap may be loosened and the elongated rod repositioned without inadvertently causing the coupling body to become unlocked from the fastener head. Alternatively, the cap may be urged further down into the skirt as it is turned toward the second, locking position. As the cap is lowered, the upper portion of the enlarged opening or slot, which mayor may not have a cam or incline, will press the rod against the seat of the ring arm. For instance, the cap and skirt may be configured with threads that draw the cap into the skirt when it is turned in one direction and releases the cap from the skirt when turned in the opposite direction. Preferably, the skirt and/or cap are configured to provide a tactile feel or audible click when the cap reaches either the first or second position, or both positions. One advantage of this is that the physician will receive confirmation that the assembly is in a desired position. In addition, the cap and skirt may be configured with one or more detents or similar mechanisms to help prevent the cap from inadvertently backing out of either the first or second positions. While the skirt and fastener may be fixed in position relative to each other once the cap is in the second position, the rod may still be capable of sliding through the openings of the skirt and cap. The cap may be configured with an aperture disposed on its upper surface where a set screw may be utilized to securely hold the rod in place once it is in its desired position. As illustrated by the many embodiments described above, the present invention is capable of providing greater flexibility for the physician for installing and adjusting a spinal fixation system. In practice, the physician installs a plurality of fasteners to the treated area of the spine. The fasteners 20 are configured with coupling elements 26 that can be moved and rotated into several positions. The physician may lock in a desired position for the coupling element 26 without requiring the elongated rod to also be locked in position. Likewise, the physician may unlock coupling element 26 from the fastener 20 even after the 5 rod has been locked to the coupling element. Thus, the physician is free to readjust the rotation and angle of the coupling element 26 with respect to the fastener 20 at any time. In sum, the embodiments described above show that the present invention provides several advantages not previously achieved by the prior art. For instance, one advantage realized by allowing independent locking and unlocking of the rod locking device and the coupling locking device is that the polyaxial screw permits significantly greater adjustability than could be accomplished in the past. Adjustment of the connection between the rod and the coupling device need not risk losing a desired positioning of the coupling element with respect to the screw. Thus, the present invention allows for fine tuning whereas prior systems required were designed to loosen all of the components in order to reposition any component. In addition to providing greater adjustability, the present invention also reduces the complexity and number of the surgical steps involved for installing a spine stabilization system. The present invention also provides for a more compact design than could be achieved in the past, and reduces the number of separate pieces associated with the implant. Altogether, these advantages will help reduce intra operative time, simplify the surgical procedure, and work well in a wider variety of patient anatomy.
