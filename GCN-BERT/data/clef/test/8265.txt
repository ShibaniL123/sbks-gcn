Example 423
1-(3-Fluoropropyl)-3-isopropyl-5-methyl-6-[(5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methyl]thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione
188 mg (0.419 mmol) of the compound from Example 418 were dissolved in 7.5 ml of 1,4-dioxane, and 66 mg (0.252 mmol) of triphenylphosphine were added. To this solution were then added 33 μl (0.88 mmol) of formic acid, 146 μl (1.05 mmol) of triethylamine and 73 mg (0.063 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0). The mixture was heated to 120° C. in a microwave oven (Biotage Initiator with dynamic control of irradiation power) for 120 h. The reaction mixture was then added to semisaturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (70 ml). The mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases were dried over sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated. The residue was dissolved in 3 ml of DMSO and this solution was purified by means of preparative HPLC (Method 14). Combination of the product fractions and freeze-drying gave 85 mg (45% of theory) of the title compound
