Example 9
Synthesis of (R)-1-(8-(1-methoxy-2-methylpropan-2-ylamino)-2-(methylsulfinyl)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)ethyl benzoate
(R)-1-(8-(1-methoxy-2-methylpropan-2-ylamino)-2-(methylthio)pyrido[3,4-d]pyrimidin-6-yl)ethyl benzoate synthesized by the process described in Example 7 (1.9 g, 4.46 mmol) was dissolved in dichloromethane (30 mL) and the solution was stirred at 0°C. m-CPBA (0.767 g, 4.46 mmol) was gradually added to the solution at 0°C, and the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight. The reaction was monitored by LC/MS. After completion of the reaction, the reaction was quenched by addition of an aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution for reduction of excess reagent. The aqueous phase was extracted three times with dichloromethane (30 mL). The resultant organic phases were combined together and washed once with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (50 mL) and once with saturated brine (50 mL). The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solid was separated by filtration. The filtrate was then concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography to yield the title compound (1.9 g, 96%).
