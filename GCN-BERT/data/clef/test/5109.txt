The present invention relates to a cosmetic composition for coating keratin fibres, in particular the eyelashes or eyebrows. In particular, said cosmetic composition is a composition for making up and optionally caring for the eyelashes. The present invention also relates to a method for coating keratin fibres, in particular to a method for making up and optionally caring for the eyelashes. The present invention also relates to a method for producing a cosmetic composition for coating keratin fibres and also to a composition obtained by means of such a production method. The present invention also relates to particular uses. The composition used can in particular be provided in the form of a product for the eyelashes, such as a mascara, or a product for the eyebrows. More preferentially, the invention relates to a mascara. The term “mascara” is understood to mean a composition intended to be applied to the eyelashes: it can be a composition for making up the eyelashes, a base for making up the eyelashes (also known as base coat), a composition to be applied over a mascara, also known as top coat, or a composition for the cosmetic treatment of the eyelashes. The mascara is more particularly intended for human eyelashes but also for false eyelashes. Mascaras are prepared in particular according to two types of formulation: water-based mascaras, known as cream mascaras, in the form of a dispersion of waxes in water; anhydrous mascaras or mascaras with a low water content, known as waterproof mascaras, in the form of dispersions of waxes in organic solvents. Generally, anhydrous mascaras have a good water resistance, but the level of volume is generally low and they are difficult to remove, whereas water-based mascaras have a lower water resistance but a high level of volume and are easier to remove. The present application relates more specifically to “water-based” mascaras. Compositions for coating keratin fibres with such a type of mascara generally consist of at least one fatty phase generally formed of one or more waxes dispersed in an aqueous liquid phase by means of an emulsifying system or conveyed in an organic solvent. The application of mascara is aimed in particular at increasing the volume of the eyelashes and consequently at increasing the intensity of the gaze. Numerous thickening or volumizing mascaras exist to do this, the principle of which consists in depositing the maximum amount of material onto the eyelashes so as to obtain this volumizing (or charging) effect. It is in particular by means of the amount of particles (in particular waxes) that the desired application specificities for the compositions can be adjusted, such as, for example, their fluidity or consistency, and also their thickening power (also known as the charging or making-up power). However, one problem encountered is that the conventional routes for formulating water-based mascaras do not make it possible to exceed a high solids content, for example greater than or equal to 42%, for fear of obtaining a texture which is too thick. An aim of the present application is more particularly to provide a mascara in the form of an emulsion, preferably with a high solids content, for example greater than or equal to 42%. More particularly, an aim of the present invention consists in stabilising a direct emulsion rich in fatty substances, in particular in waxes, without phase separation over time and/or caused by UV radiation and/or caused by light. An aim of the present application is more particularly to provide a stable mascara exhibiting a texture which is sufficiently thick to obtain a charging deposited layer, of satisfactory consistency, enabling easy application to the eyelashes and an even deposited layer, that is to say a layer which is smooth and homogeneous, even after being stored at 4° C. for two months. Another aim of the present application is to provide a stable mascara exhibiting a texture which is sufficiently thick to obtain a charging deposited layer, of satisfactory consistency, enabling easy application to the eyelashes and an even deposited layer, that is to say a layer which is smooth and homogeneous, even after being stored at 45° C. for two months. An aim of the present application is more particularly to provide a stable mascara exhibiting a texture which is sufficiently thick to obtain a charging deposited layer, of satisfactory consistency, enabling easy application to the eyelashes and an even deposited layer, that is to say a layer which is smooth and homogeneous, even after being stored for two months at temperatures oscillating between 4° C. and 45° C. An aim of the present application is more particularly to provide a mascara in which the waxes are homogeneously dispersed. An aim of the present application is more particularly to provide a mascara in which the pigments are homogeneously dispersed. An aim of the present application is more particularly to provide a mascara which is pleasant to apply. An aim of the present invention is more particularly to provide a composition for coating keratin fibres which makes possible good separation of the eyelashes during its application, without formation of bunches of eyelashes, and while ensuring smooth and even deposition of material (without lumps of composition). An aim of the present invention is more particularly to obtain a composition for coating keratin fibres, preferably a mascara, which has good application properties in terms of slip and of playtime (redeposition, retouching). Another aim of the present invention is to obtain a composition for coating keratin fibres, preferably a mascara, which gives rise to a volume effect on the eyelashes. Another aim of the present invention is to obtain a composition for coating keratin fibres, preferably a mascara, which has a good wear property on the eyelashes. Another aim of the present invention is to obtain a composition for coating keratin fibres, preferably a mascara, which gives rise to a charging or covering deposited layer. Another aim of the present invention is to obtain a composition for coating keratin fibres, preferably a mascara, which has good lengthening properties for the eyelashes coated with such a composition. Another aim of the present invention is to obtain a composition for coating keratin fibres, preferably a mascara, which has good curling properties for the eyelashes coated with such a composition. Another aim of the present invention is to obtain a composition for coating keratin fibres, preferably a mascara, which has good black intensity, from a colorimetry and chromaticity point of view. Another aim of the present invention is to obtain a composition for coating keratin fibres, preferably a mascara, which has good adhesion to the eyelashes. In particular, an aim of the present invention is to prepare a composition for coating keratin fibres which has a good wear property, and is resistant to rubbing and/or to water, and in particular to ambient moisture, tears, sweat and/or sebum, while at the same time being easy to remove. Consequently, a subject of the present invention is a cosmetic composition for coating keratin fibres, preferably the eyelashes, preferably a mascara composition, of the emulsion type, preferably wax(es)-in-water emulsion type, comprising: an aqueous phase,particles comprising at least one hard wax, preferentially present in the form of at least one aqueous dispersion of particles of hard wax(es) having a melting point greater than or equal to 60° C., the hard wax(es) being present at a total content greater than or equal to 10% by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition,at least one emulsifying system capable of dispersing at least the hard wax(es), preferably comprising at least one non-ionic surfactant with an HLB value at 25° C. greater than or equal to 8, preferably greater than or equal to 10,at least one anionic associative polymer comprising: i) a backbone chain derived from at least one monomer comprising at least one carboxylic acid and at least one α,β-monoethylenic unsaturation, an ester or esters thereof, a salt or salts thereof, and a mixture thereof,ii) at least one hydrophobic chain extending laterally relative to said backbone chain, andiii) at least one alkoxylated or glycerolated spacer linking said backbone chain and said hydrophobic chain(s).According to one preferred embodiment, the particles in accordance with the invention comprise: * at least one hard wax, preferentially present in the form of at least one aqueous dispersion of particles of hard wax(es) having a melting point greater than or equal to 60° C., the hard wax(es) being present at a total content greater than or equal to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition, and* preferably at least one aqueous dispersion of particles of at least one film-forming polymer, the film-forming polymer(s) preferably being present at a dry matter content greater than or equal to 5%, preferably greater than or equal to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of said composition. Surprisingly and unexpectedly, the inventors of the present application have solved this or these problem(s) by means of such a composition. In particular, a composition in accordance with the invention gives rise to a composition in the form of an emulsion, which can be rich in solids, in particular in fatty substances, which is stable, and which has a homogeneous and even dispersion of waxes, even after 2 months, whether at 45° C. or at 4° C. It appears that such a composition also exhibits a good dispersion of the pigments, is smooth and glossy and exhibits an intense black. Such a composition is also pleasant to apply and comfortable, and exhibits a volume effect. Furthermore, this composition exhibits good water resistance by virtue of a large presence of film-forming particles as an aqueous dispersion, without having a great impact on the volume effect.

According to a sixth aspect, another subject of the present invention is a composition obtained by means of said method of production as described above. According to a seventh aspect, another subject of the present invention is the use of a method of preparation as described above, for obtaining makeup compositions, in particular mascara compositions, which are preferentially black, smooth, glossy and/or, preferably, of intense colour.

Within the meaning of the present invention, the “solids content” denotes the content of non-volatile matter. The solids content (abbreviated to SC) of a composition according to the invention is measured using a “Halogen Moisture Analyzer HR 73” commercial halogen drying device from Mettler Toledo. The measurement is carried out on the basis of the weight loss of a sample dried by halogen heating and thus represents the percentage of residual matter once the water and the volatile matter have evaporated. This technique is fully described in the documentation of the device supplied by Mettler Toledo. The measurement protocol is as follows: Approximately 2 g of the composition, hereinafter the sample, are spread out over a metal dish, which is introduced into the abovementioned halogen drying device. The sample is then subjected to a temperature of 105° C. until an unchanging weight is obtained. The wet weight of the sample, corresponding to its initial weight, and the dry weight of the sample, corresponding to its weight after halogen heating, are measured using a precision balance. The experimental error associated with the measurement is of the order of plus or minus 2%. The solids content is calculated in the following way: Solids content (expressed as % by weight) =100 x (dry weight/wet weight). A composition according to the invention comprises particles of waxes, particles of film-forming polymer(s), and at least one particular emulsifying system. Emulsifying System A composition according to the invention comprises an emulsifying system.

More specifically, a composition according to the invention comprises at least one non-ionic surfactant with an HLB value within the Griffin meaning, at 25° C., greater than or equal to 8, preferably greater than or equal to 10.

The anionic associative polymer(s) according to the invention is (are) preferably a block copolymer or block copolymers.

Preferentially, the anionic associative polymer(s) used in the present invention comprise(s) a backbone chain derived from at least one monomer of (meth)acrylic acid, an ester or esters thereof, a salt or salts thereof, and a mixture thereof.

The hydrophobic chain(s) may be low in number with respect to the backbone.

Preferably, said alkoxylated ester of a fatty acid is chosen from said oxyethylenated ester of stearic acid, for example comprising 40 oxyethylene groups, also known as PEG-40 stearate. According to one particular embodiment, the hydrophilic spacer and the hydrophobic chain are linked, before polymerization, by esterification with a (meth)acrylic acid.

Particles The compositions according to the present invention comprise particles of hard wax(es) and preferably of film-forming polymer(s), preferentially both present in the form of an aqueous dispersion or aqueous dispersions. These particles can be characterized by an average particle size. Such particles are generally isotropic, in particular with a substantially spherical shape or spherical shape. Particle Size A particle size can be measured by various techniques. Mention may in particular be made of (dynamic and static) light scattering techniques, Coulter capture techniques, measurements of sedimentation rate (related to the size via Stokes law) and microscopy. These techniques make it possible to measure a particle diameter, and for some particles, a particle size distribution. Preferably, the sizes and the size distributions of the particles of the compositions according to the invention are measured by static light scattering using a commercial particle size analyser of MasterSizer 2000 type from Malvern. The data are processed on the basis of the Mie scattering theory. This theory, which is exact for isotropic particles, makes it possible to determine, in the case of non-spherical particles, an “effective” particle diameter. This theory is in particular described in the publication by Van de Hulst, H. C., “Light Scattering by Small Particles”, Chapters 9 and 10, Wiley, N.Y., 1957. In the context of the present invention, the “average particle size” is expressed as volume-average “effective” diameter D[4,3], defined in the following way: D  [ 4 , 3 ] = ∑ i   V i · d i ∑ i   V i where Vi represents the volume of the particles of effective diameter di. This parameter is in particular described in the technical documentation of the particle size analyser. The measurements are carried out at 25° C., on a dilute particle dispersion. The “effective” diameter is obtained by taking a refractive index of 1.33 for water and an average refractive index of 1.45 for the particles. Thus, preferentially, the particles of the compositions in accordance with the invention, comprising at least one hard wax and preferably at least one film-forming polymer, preferentially present in the form of aqueous dispersions, have an average size, expressed as volume-average “effective” diameter D[4,3], of less than or equal to 5 μm, in particular strictly less than 5 μm, more preferentially than 2 μm, and even more preferentially less than or equal to 1 μm. Such particle sizes preferentially correspond to the size of the particles in the final composition. This average particle size is advantageous in terms of the use of the composition in accordance with the present invention compared with compositions comprising particles of hard waxes and of film-forming polymers of larger sizes which result in a mascara that is difficult or even impossible to formulate, granular, too thick, impossible to apply (too compact and non-disintegrable) and uncomfortable, that exhibits a poor dispersion of the pigments and fillers, and that has a matt colour. It is understood that the emulsifying system(s) will have a tendency to be positioned at the interface of the aqueous phase and of the particles of hard waxes, and optionally of the particles of film-forming polymers, so as to stabilize them. The particle sizes measured are therefore done so in the presence of the surfactant(s), since the latter are difficult to dissociate from the particles. The sizes measured and given take into account this particularity. With regard to the other particles of the composition, for example colorants and fillers, these compounds will be dealt with independently in another section of the description, the size characteristics of particles of this type diverging in comparison with the particle sizes of the waxes and film-forming polymers in accordance with the invention. The particles are advantageously present in a composition in accordance with the invention at a content greater than or equal to 30% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition, better still ranging from 35% to 60% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. Wax(es) The wax(es) is (are) in general a lipophilic compound that is solid at ambient temperature (25° C.), with a reversible solid/liquid change in state, having a melting point of greater than or equal to 30° C., which may be up to 200° C. and in particular up to 120° C. Within the meaning of the invention, the melting point corresponds to the temperature of the most endothermic peak observed in thermal analysis (DSC) as described in Standard ISO 11357-3; 1999. The melting point of the wax can be measured using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), for example the calorimeter sold under the name DSC Q2000 by the company TA Instruments. Preferably, the waxes exhibit an enthalpy of fusion ΔHf of greater than or equal to 70 J/g. Preferably, the waxes comprise at least one crystallizable part, which is visible by X-ray observation. The measurement protocol is as follows: A sample of 5 mg of wax placed in a crucible is subjected to a first temperature rise passing from −20° C. to 120° C. at a heating rate of 10° C./minute, is then cooled from 120° C. to −20° C. at a cooling rate of 10° C./minute and is finally subjected to a second temperature rise passing from −20° C. to 120° C. at a heating rate of 5° C./minute. During the second temperature rise, the following parameters are measured: the melting point (M.p.) of the wax, as mentioned above corresponding to the temperature of the most endothermic peak of the melting curve observed, representing the variation of the difference in power absorbed as a function of the temperature, ΔHf: the enthalpy of fusion of the wax, corresponding to the integral of the entire melting curve obtained. This enthalpy of fusion of the wax is the amount of energy necessary to make the compound change from the solid state to the liquid state. It is expressed in J/g. The wax(es) can be hydrocarbon-based wax(es), fluoro wax(es) and/or silicone wax(es) and can be of vegetable, mineral, animal and/or synthetic origin. The wax(es) may be present at a total content greater than or equal to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition, better still 15% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. Preferably, it is (they are) present at a content ranging from 10% to 30% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition, better still from 15% to 30% by weight. A composition according to the invention comprises at least one hard wax, preferably present in the preparation of the composition in the form of an aqueous dispersion of particle(s) of wax(es). Hard Wax According to the invention, the composition comprises more specifically at least one hard wax. For the purposes of the present invention, the term “hard wax” is understood to mean a wax which has a melting point greater than or equal to 60° C., in particular ranging from 65 to 120° C., more preferentially between 70 and 100° C. Advantageously, for the purposes of the present invention, the term “hard wax” is understood to mean a wax exhibiting, at 20° C., a hardness of greater than 5 MPa, in particular ranging from 5 to 30 MPa, preferably of greater than 6 MPa, better still ranging from 6 to 25 MPa. To carry out these hardness measurements, the wax is melted at a temperature equal to the melting point of the wax +20° C. For this, 30 g of wax are placed in a 100 ml beaker with a diameter equal to 50 ml, which is itself placed on a magnetic stirrer hotplate. An amount of approximately 15 g of molten wax is poured into a stainless steel vessel 80 mm in diameter and 15 mm deep, preheated to 45° C. in an oven. The wax is then left to recrystallize in a thermostated room at 20° C. for 24 hours before carrying out the measurement. The mechanical properties of the wax or of the mixture of waxes are determined in a thermostated room at 20° C. using the texture analyser sold under the name TA-XT2i by the company Swantech, equipped with a stainless steel cylinder having a diameter of 2 mm. The measurement comprises 3 steps: a first step after automatic detection of the surface of the sample in which the spindle moves at the measuring speed of 0.1 mm/s, and penetrates the wax to a penetration depth of 0.3 mm, and the software notes the value of the maximum force attained; a second step, referred to as relaxation step, in which the spindle remains at this position for one second and in which the force is noted after 1 second of relaxation; finally, a 3rd step, referred to as withdrawal step, in which the spindle returns to its initial position at the speed of 1 mm/s and the probe withdrawal energy (negative force) is noted. The value of the hardness is the maximum compressive force measured in newtons, divided by the surface area of the cylinder of the texture analyser in mm2 in contact with the wax. The hardness value obtained is expressed in megapascals or MPa.

Preferably, the particles of waxes used in the preparation of a composition in accordance with the present invention are not introduced in the form of a microdispersion of preprepared hard waxes, as described in patent applications FR 2 687 569 or FR 2 815 849. Indeed, the hard wax(es) used in a composition in accordance with the present invention is (are) introduced in the form of powder or a solid fatty substance. However, the final composition can be defined as comprising an aqueous dispersion of hard wax(es). Indeed, according to the present method of production, the dispersion of hard wax(es) is carried out in situ, making it possible, surprisingly and advantageously, to achieve high solids contents and high contents of hard wax(es) which would be unattainable if a preprepared microdispersion of hard waxes was introduced as it is in order to produce a cosmetic composition according to the invention. Indeed, in the present invention, the water resulting from the aqueous dispersion of the film-forming polymer(s) serves to carry out the dispersion of the hard wax(es). The hard wax(es) is (are) preferably polar. For the purposes of the present invention, the term “polar wax” is understood to mean a wax for which the solubility parameter calculated beyond its melting point δa is other than 0 (J/cm3)1/2. In particular, the term “polar wax” is understood to mean a wax for which the chemical structure is formed essentially of, indeed even consists of, carbon and hydrogen atoms and comprises at least one highly electronegative heteroatom, such as an oxygen, nitrogen, silicon or phosphorus atom. The definition and calculation of the solubility parameters in the Hansen three-dimensional solubility space are described in the paper by C. M. Hansen: “The three-dimensional solubility parameters”, J. Paint Technol., 39, 105 (1967). According to this Hansen space: δD characterizes the London dispersion forces derived from the formation of dipoles induced during molecular impacts;δp characterizes the Debye interaction forces between permanent dipoles and also the Keesom interaction forces between induced dipoles and permanent dipoles;δh characterizes the specific interaction forces (such as hydrogen bonding, acid/base, donor/acceptor, etc.); andδa is determined by the equation: δa=(δp2+δh2)1/2 The parameters δp, δh, δD and δa are expressed in (J/cm3)1/2. The composition according to the invention comprises a content of hard wax(es), preferentially present in the form of an aqueous dispersion, greater than or equal to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition, better still greater than or equal to 15% by weight relative to the total weight of the composition. More generally, the composition according to the invention advantageously comprises a total content of hard wax(es), preferentially present in the form of an aqueous dispersion, ranging from 10% to 30% by weight, better still from 15% to 30% by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition. According to one advantageous embodiment, the composition according to the invention comprises a total content of particles of hard wax(es), preferentially present in the form of an aqueous dispersion, representing at least 80% by weight, preferentially at least 90% by weight and more preferentially 100% by weight, relative to the total weight of wax(es). Preferably, the total content of hard wax(es), preferentially present in the form of an aqueous dispersion, is greater than or equal to 30% by weight and preferentially greater than or equal to 40% by weight, relative to the total weight of the solid particles. According to one advantageous embodiment, the total content of hard wax(es), preferentially present in the form of an aqueous dispersion, represents at least 80% by weight, preferentially at least 90% by weight and more preferentially 100% by weight, relative to the total weight of fatty substances. Additionally, a composition according to the invention may comprise at least one soft wax, optionally present in the form of an aqueous dispersion of particles of wax(es), i.e. a wax of which the melting point is strictly below 50° C. and optionally of which the hardness is strictly less than 5 MPa. However, a composition according to the invention preferably comprises less than 5% by weight of soft wax(es), preferably less than 2% by weight of soft wax(es) and even more preferentially is free of soft wax(es). The total content of anionic associative polymer(s) and the total content of wax(es) are such that the weight ratio of anionic associative polymer(s) to wax(es) is greater than or equal to 1/250, preferably inclusively between 1/200 and 1/20, more preferentially between 1/150 and 1/50. Film-Forming Polymer(s) The composition according to the invention preferably comprises at least one aqueous dispersion of particles of film-forming polymer(s) and optionally at least one additional film-forming polymer (not present in the form of an aqueous dispersion of particles, such as a water-soluble, film-forming polymer). In the present application, the term “film-forming polymer” is understood to mean a polymer which is capable, by itself alone or in the presence of an additional film-forming agent, of forming a macroscopically continuous deposited layer and preferably a cohesive deposited layer, better still a deposited layer having cohesive and mechanical properties such that said deposited layer can be isolated and handled in isolation, for example when said deposited layer is prepared by pouring onto a non-stick surface, such as a Teflon-coated or silicone-coated surface.

A composition according to the invention preferably comprises a total dry matter content in terms of film-forming polymer(s) ranging from 10% to 30% by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition, better still from 12% to 25%. The composition according to the invention preferably comprises more specifically at least one aqueous dispersion of particles formed from one or more film-forming polymers. It can also comprise at least one water-soluble, film-forming polymer. Thus, a composition can comprise at least one additional film-forming polymer which is distinct from particles of film-forming polymer(s) present in the form of an aqueous dispersion. The content of this (these) additional film-forming polymer(s), termed water-soluble, is preferably less than or equal to 10% by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition, even more preferentially less than or equal to 5% by weight, better still less than or equal to 2% by weight, relative to the total weight of the composition. Film-Forming Polymer(s) as an Aqueous Dispersion Such a film-forming polymer, present in said preparation of the composition in the form of particles as an aqueous dispersion, is generally known as a (pseudo)latex, i.e. latex or pseudolatex. The techniques for preparing these dispersions are well known to those skilled in the art. A dispersion suitable for the invention can comprise one or more types of particles, it being possible for these particles to vary in terms of their size, their structure and/or their chemical nature.

Generally, these polymers may be random polymers, block copolymers of type A-B, multiblock A-B-A or else ABCD, etc, or even grafted polymers. Free-Radical Film-Forming Polymer The term “free-radical polymer” is understood to mean a polymer obtained by polymerization of unsaturated and in particular ethylenically unsaturated monomers, each monomer being capable of homopolymerizing (unlike polycondensates). The film-forming polymers of free-radical type may in particular be acrylic and/or vinyl homopolymers or copolymers. The vinyl film-forming polymers may result from the polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers containing at least one acid group and/or esters of these acid monomers and/or amides of these acid monomers. Ethylenically unsaturated monomers having at least one acid group or acid-group-bearing monomer that may be used include α,β-ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids such as acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, crotonic acid, maleic acid or itaconic acid. (Meth)acrylic acid and crotonic acid are particularly used, and more particularly (meth)acrylic acid. The esters of acidic monomers are advantageously chosen from (meth)acrylic acid esters (also known as (meth)acrylates), in particular (meth)acrylates of an alkyl, in particular of a C1-C20 and preferably C1-C8 alkyl, (meth)acrylates of an aryl, in particular of a C6-C10 aryl, and (meth)acrylates of a hydroxyalkyl, in particular of a C2-C6 hydroxyalkyl.

Among the aryl (meth)acrylates that may be mentioned are benzyl acrylate and phenyl acrylate. The (meth)acrylic acid esters are in particular alkyl (meth)acrylates. According to the present invention, the alkyl group of the esters may be either fluorinated or perfluorinated, i.e. some or all of the hydrogen atoms of the alkyl group are substituted with fluorine atoms. Examples of amides of the acid monomers that may be mentioned are (meth)acrylamides, and in particular N-alkyl(meth)acrylamides, in particular of a C2-C12 alkyl. Among the N-alkyl(meth)acrylamides that may be mentioned are N-ethylacrylamide, N-t-butylacrylamide and N-t-octylacrylamide. The vinyl film-forming polymers may also result from the homopolymerization or copolymerization of monomers chosen from vinyl esters and styrene monomers. In particular, these monomers may be polymerized with acid monomers and/or esters thereof and/or amides thereof, such as those mentioned previously. Examples of vinyl esters that may be mentioned are vinyl acetate, vinyl neodecanoate, vinyl pivalate, vinyl benzoate and vinyl t-butylbenzoate. Styrene monomers that may be mentioned include styrene and α-methylstyrene. The list of monomers given is not limiting, and it is possible to use any monomer known to those skilled in the art included in the categories of acrylic and vinyl monomers (including monomers modified with a silicone chain). As vinyl polymer, use may also be made of silicone-comprising acrylic polymers. Mention may also be made of the polymers resulting from the free-radical polymerization of one or more free-radical monomers inside and/or partially at the surface of preexisting particles of at least one polymer chosen from the group consisting of polyurethanes, polyureas, polyesters, polyesteramides and/or alkyds.

The film-forming polyurethane may be, for example, an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic polyurethane, polyurea/urethane or polyurea copolymer comprising, alone or as a mixture, at least one block chosen from: a block of aliphatic and/or cycloaliphatic and/or aromatic polyester origin, and/ora branched or non-branched silicone block, for example polydimethylsiloxane or polymethylphenylsiloxane, and/ora block comprising fluoro groups. The film-forming polyurethanes as defined in the invention may also be obtained from branched or non-branched polyesters or from alkyds comprising labile hydrogens, which are modified by reaction with a diisocyanate and a difunctional organic compound (for example dihydroxy, diamino or hydroxyamino), also comprising either a carboxylic acid or carboxylate group, or a sulfonic acid or sulfonate group, or alternatively a neutralizable tertiary amine group or a quaternary ammonium group. Among the film-forming polycondensates, mention may also be made of polyesters, polyesteramides, fatty-chain polyesters, polyamides and epoxyester resins. The polyesters may be obtained, in a known manner, by polycondensation of dicarboxylic acids with polyols, in particular diols. The dicarboxylic acid may be aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic.

According to one particular embodiment of the invention, said at least one film-forming polymer in the dispersed state is chosen from acrylic polymer dispersions, polyurethane dispersions, sulfopolyester dispersions, vinyl dispersions, polyvinyl acetate dispersions, vinylpyrrolidone/dimethylaminopropylmethacrylamide/lauryldimethylpropylmethacrylamido ammonium chloride terpolymer dispersions, polyurethane/polyacrylic hybrid polymer dispersions, dispersions of particles of core-shell type, and mixtures thereof. Various types of aqueous dispersions, which are in particular commercially available, which are suitable for preparing the composition in accordance with the present invention, are detailed hereinafter. 1/ Thus, according to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the aqueous dispersion of particles of polymer is an aqueous dispersion of acrylic polymer. In particular, the acrylic polymer may be a styrene/acrylate copolymer, and in particular a polymer chosen from copolymers derived from the polymerization of at least one styrene monomer and at least one C1-C18 alkyl (meth)acrylate monomer. As styrene monomers that may be used in the invention, mention may be made, for example, of styrene or a-methylstyrene, and in particular styrene. The C1-C18 alkyl (meth)acrylate monomer is in particular a C1-C12 alkyl (meth)acrylate and more particularly a C1-C10 alkyl (meth)acrylate. The C1-C18 alkyl (meth)acrylate monomer may be chosen from methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, propyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, butyl methacrylate, hexyl acrylate, octyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, lauryl (meth)acrylate and stearyl (meth)acrylate.

The anionic nature of the polyester-polyurethanes and of the polyether-polyurethanes used according to the invention is due to the presence, in their constituent units, of groups comprising a carboxylic acid or sulfonic acid function. The particles of polyester-polyurethanes or of polyether polyurethanes that are used according to the invention are generally sold in the form of aqueous dispersions. The particle content of said dispersions currently available on the market ranges from approximately 20% to approximately 60% by weight relative to the total weight of the dispersion. Among the anionic polyester-polyurethane dispersions that can be used in the compositions according to the invention, mention may particularly be made of the product sold under the name Avalure UR 405® by the company Noveon or Baycusan 01004 by the company Bayer Material Science. Among the dispersions of particles of anionic polyether-polyurethane that can be used according to the invention, mention may particularly be made of those sold under the name Avalure UR 450® by the company Noveon and under the name Neorez R 970® by the company DSM. According to one particular embodiment of the invention, use may be made of a mixture of commercial dispersions consisting of particles of anionic polyester polyurethane, as defined above, and of particles of anionic polyether-polyurethane, also defined above. For example, use may be made of a mixture consisting of the dispersion sold under the name Sancure 861® or a mixture of the product sold under the name Avalure UR 405® and of the product sold under the name Avalure UR 450®, these dispersions being sold by the company Noveon. 3/ According to another particular embodiment of the invention, the aqueous dispersion used comprises a mixture of at least two film-forming polymers in the form of particles which are distinct in terms of their respective glass transition temperatures (Tg). In particular, according to one embodiment of the invention, the composition in accordance with the invention may comprise at least one first film-forming polymer in the dispersed state and at least one second film-forming polymer in the dispersed state, said first and second polymers having different Tgs, and preferably the Tg of the first polymer (Tg1) is higher than the Tg of the second polymer (Tg2). In particular, the difference between Tg1 and Tg2 is, in absolute value, at least 10° C., preferably at least 20° C. More specifically, it comprises, in an acceptable aqueous medium: a) particles, dispersed in the aqueous medium, of a first film-forming polymer having at least one glass transition temperature Tg1 greater than or equal to 20° C., and b) particles, dispersed in the aqueous medium, of a second film-forming polymer having at least one glass transition temperature Tg2 less than or equal to 70° C. This dispersion generally results from a mixture of two aqueous dispersions of film-forming polymer. The first film-forming polymer has at least one, in particular has one, glass transition temperature Tg1 greater than or equal to 20° C., in particular ranging from 20° C. to 150° C., and advantageously greater than or equal to 40° C., in particular ranging from 40° C. to 150° C., and in particular greater than or equal to 50° C., in particular ranging from 50° C. to 150° C. The second film-forming polymer has at least one, in particular has one, glass transition temperature Tg2 less than or equal to 70° C., in particular ranging from −120° C. to 70° C., and in particular less than 50° C., in particular ranging from −60° C. to +50° C., and more particularly ranging from −30° C. to 30° C. The measurement of the glass transition temperature (Tg) of a polymer is carried out by DMTA (Dynamical and Mechanical Temperature Analysis) as described below. To measure the glass transition temperature (Tg) of a polymer, viscoelasticimetry tests are carried out with a DMTA apparatus from Polymer laboratories, on a sample of film. This film is prepared by casting the aqueous dispersion of film-forming polymer in a teflon-coated template and then dried at 120° C. for 24 hours. A film is then obtained, from which test specimens are cut (for example using a hole punch). These test specimens are typically approximately 150 μm thick, from 5 to 10 mm wide and have a useful length of about 10 to 15 mm. This sample is subjected to a tensile stress. The sample is subjected to a static force of 0.01 N on which is superposed a sinusoidal displacement of +/−8 μm at a frequency of 1 Hz. The operation is thus carried out in the linear range, at low levels of strain. This tensile stress is applied to the sample at temperatures ranging from −150° C. to +200° C. with a temperature variation of 3° C. per minute. The complex modulus E*=E′+iE″ of the polymer tested is then measured as a function of the temperature. From these measurements, the dynamic moduli E′, E″ and the damping power: tgδ=E″/E′ are deduced. Next, the curve of the tgδ values as a function of the temperature is plotted; this curve exhibits at least one peak. The glass transition temperature Tg of the polymer corresponds to the temperature at which the top of this peak lies. When the curve has at least 2 peaks (in this case, the polymer has at least 2 Tgs), the Tg value of the polymer tested is taken as the temperature for which the curve exhibits a peak of highest amplitude (i.e. corresponding to the largest value of tgδ; in this case, only the “predominant” Tg is considered as the Tg value of the polymer tested). In the present invention, the transition temperature Tg1 corresponds to the “predominant” Tg (within the meaning previously defined) of the first film-forming polymer when the latter has at least 2 Tgs; the glass transition temperature Tg2 corresponds to the “predominant” Tg of the second film-forming polymer when the latter has at least 2 Tgs. The first film-forming polymer and the second film-forming polymer can be chosen, independently of one another, from free-radical polymers, polycondensates and polymers of natural origin, as previously defined, having the glass transition temperature characteristics previously defined. As first film-forming polymer in an aqueous dispersion, use may be made of the aqueous dispersions of polymer sold under the names NeoRez R-989® by the company DSM, Joncryl 95 and Joncryl®8211 by the company BASF. As second film-forming polymer in an aqueous dispersion, use may be made, for example, of the aqueous dispersions of polymer sold under the names Avalure® UR-405 and Avalure® UR-460 by the company Noveon, Acrilem IC89RT® by the company ICAP or Neocryl A-45 by the company DSM. The film-forming polymer of the Avalure® UR-460 aqueous dispersion is a polyurethane obtained by polycondensation of poly(tetramethylene oxide), of tetramethylxylylene diisocyanate, of isophorone diisocyanate and of dimethylolpropionic acid.

Assembly An assembly for coating keratin fibres suitable for the invention can comprise an applicator configured in order to apply said cosmetic composition for coating keratin fibres and, where appropriate, a packaging device suitable for receiving said composition. According to one particular embodiment, such an assembly may comprise means for heating a composition in accordance with the invention. Heating Means A composition in accordance with the invention can be subjected to heating means before and/or during application. These heating means can be rigidly connected to an assembly for coating keratin fibres and more particularly to an applicator configured in order to apply said cosmetic composition for coating keratin fibres and, where appropriate, a packaging device suitable for receiving said composition. These heating means are then suitable for melting at least one part of the fatty phase, and in particular at least one part of the emulsifying system and, where appropriate, at least one part of the soft wax(es), and optionally at least one part of the particles of hard wax(es). The wax particles are heated at a temperature Tc such that only a part of the crystallized chains is melted. The heating means can also come into contact with or come to be opposite the composition to be heated. The composition can be heated while it is contained in a packaging device. The composition can be heated while it is at least partially exposed to ambient air. The composition can be heated locally at a temperature greater than or equal to 45° C., or even greater than or equal to 50° C., or else greater than or equal to 55° C. The temperature of the composition must not cause any risk of burning at the moment of application. This is why, when the composition is heated before application, a waiting time between the moment at which the composition is heated and the application to the keratin materials may optionally be necessary. According to one embodiment variant, the composition is heated simultaneously with its application to the keratin fibres. According to another variant, the composition is heated before and during its application to the keratin fibres. The temperature at which at least one part of the composition is heated may be inclusively between 45° C. and 95° C., better still 50° to 85° C. and even better still 55° C. to 75° C. The temperature may, for example, be measured at the surface using an infrared pyrometer, for example of the Fluke® brand. The composition in accordance with the invention is capable of reversibly changing from a solid state to an at least partially liquid, or even totally liquid, state. The solid/liquid change of state is at least partly due to the melting of a crystalline part, in particular of the wax(es) described above in this description. The total enthalpy of fusion of the composition is the enthalpy consumed by the composition between −20° C. and 120° C. The total enthalpy of fusion of the composition is equal to the area under the curve of the thermogram obtained using a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), such as the calorimeter sold under the name MDSC 2920 by TA Instruments, with a temperature rise of 5° C. or 10° C. per minute, according to Standard ISO 11357-3:1999. Measurement Protocol: A sample of 5 mg of composition is placed in a crucible and subjected to a first temperature rise which goes from −20° C. to 120° C., at a heating speed of 10° C./minute, and then is cooled from 120° C. à −20° C. at a cooling speed of 10° C./minute. The sample is kept at −20° C. for 5 min and, finally, subjected to a second temperature rise which goes from −20° C. to 100° C., at a heating speed of 5° C./minute. During the second temperature rise, the variation in the difference in power absorbed by an empty crucible and by the crucible containing the sample of the composition is measured as a function of the temperature. The melting point of the compound is the value of the temperature corresponding to the tip of the peak of the curve representing the variation in the difference in power absorbed as a function of the temperature. The enthalpy of fusion of the composition consumed at the temperature Tc is the amount of energy required to make the compound pass from the solid or very viscous state at −20° C. to the state of the composition at the temperature Tc. It is expressed in J/g. According to one embodiment of the invention, the composition is chosen such that the ratio of the enthalpy consumed between −20° C. and Tc by the product to the total enthalpy consumed between —20° C. and 120° C. is less than or equal to 0.7. This relationship is, for example, confirmed for a temperature Tc of the composition of between 45° C. and 80° C. The choice of the temperature Tc to which the composition is brought by the heating means may thus be made in such a way that said ratio is less than or equal to 0.7, for example inclusively between 0.3 and 0.6. In other words, heating is carried out to a temperature such that the ratio of the enthalpy supplied in order to heat the sample of composition to the temperature Tc to the total enthalpy is less than or equal to 0.7, such a parameter being measured according to the DSC protocol described above. Only the heated composition can come into contact with the keratin fibres, for example the eyelashes, during the application. Applicator The applicator can comprise means which make it possible to smooth and/or separate keratin fibres, such as the eyelashes or eyebrows, in particular in the form of teeth, bristles or other protruding parts. The applicator is designed in order to apply the composition to the eyelashes or eyebrows and can comprise, for example, a brush or a comb. The applicator can also be used for finishing the makeup, over a region of the eyelashes or eyebrows which is made up or laden with the composition. The brush can comprise a twisted core and bristles held between the turns of the core or can be made in yet another way. The comb is, for example, produced from a single part by moulding plastic. In some implementational examples, the application element is mounted at the end of a stem which can be flexible, which can contribute to improving the comfort during application. Packaging Device The packaging device can comprise a container intended to house the composition for coating keratin fibres. This composition can then be withdrawn from the container by immersing the applicator in it. This applicator can be integral with an element for closing the container. This closing element can form a member for grasping the applicator. This grasping member can form a cap to be removably mounted on said container by any suitable means, such as screwing, snap-fastening, push-fitting or other. Such a container can thus reversibly house said applicator. This container can optionally be equipped with a wiper suitable for removing a surplus of product withdrawn by the applicator. A method for applying the composition according to the invention to the eyelashes or eyebrows can also comprise the following steps: forming a deposited layer of the cosmetic composition on the eyelashes or eyebrows, leaving the deposited layer on the eyelashes or eyebrows, it being possible for the deposited layer to dry. It should be noted that, according to another embodiment, the applicator can form a product container. In such a case, a container can, for example, be provided in the grasping member and an internal channel can internally connect this grasping member to the protruding application elements. Finally, it should be noted that the packaging and application assembly can be provided in the form of a kit, it being possible for the applicator and the packaging device to be housed separately in one and the same packaging article. The previous and following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention, and cannot limit the scope thereof. EXAMPLE A mascara composition in accordance with the invention and a comparative mascara composition outside the invention have been described below: Comparative Composition composition according Ingredients outside the to the with percentage contents invention invention Phase A Carnauba wax SP 63 from Strahl & 26 26 Pitsch Anionic associative polymer as an 0 0.9 aqueous dispersion at 30% (Aculyn 22 from Rohm and Haas (Dow Chemical)) Hydroxyethylcellulose 0.5 0 Oxyethylenated glyceryl 7.50 7.50 monostearate (30 OE) (Tagat S from Evonik Goldschmidt) Water 24 23.4 Pigments 7 7 Phase B Acrylic and styrene/acrylic 35 35 copolymers as an aqueous 40% emulsion in a water/butylene glycol/protected sodium lauryl ether sulfate mixture (Syntran 5760 CG from Interpolymer) Phase C Water 0 0.1 50% potassium hydroxide 0 0.1 These compositions were prepared as follows: i. Preparation of Phase A All the starting materials used are carefully weighed out using a balance (accuracy 0.01 g). The various waxes are melted in a 500 ml jacketed heating pan with circulation of hot oil to control the temperature. Heating is carried out at approximately 95-98° C. Once the waxes have melted, homogenization is carried out by stirring using a Moritz stirrer, which is a stirrer of rotor-stator type. It is composed of a stationary part within which a second mobile part rotates at variable speed; this device is used to prepare emulsions since it makes possible very high shearing. When the waxes are molten and homogenized, the anionic associative polymer, or the hydroxyethylcellulose according to the comparative example outside the invention (in excess), the oxyethylenated glyceryl monostearate, the water and the pigments are then added, and the mixture is emulsified for 10 minutes. ii. Preparation of Phase B Phase B is placed in a jacketed heating vessel thermostated at 5° C. with stirring with a Rayneri mixer. iii. Mixing Phase B with Phase A The hot emulsion (phase A at 95° C.) is then poured into phase B with stirring. iv. Addition of Phase C to Preparation A+B The potassium hydroxide is then diluted in water and the diluted potassium hydroxide is poured into the mixture of phase B and phase A (only for the composition according to the invention in order to neutralize the anionic associative polymer). v. End of Formulation The mascara thus obtained is transferred into a closed jar in order to prevent it from drying on contact with the air; it is then necessary to wait 24 hours in order to confirm that the formulation is homogenous and that the pigments are correctly dispersed. It should be noted that other mascara formulae can be prepared while taking the following preparation elements into consideration. In particular, it is recommended: in a first phase, to incorporate into the compounds to be subjected to heating the thickening compounds (wax(es) and anionic associative polymer(s), where appropriate, compounds chosen, for example, from gelling agents, film-forming polymers which are in particular water soluble, fillers, pasty fatty substances, etc), the water, one or more emulsifying system(s), it being given that the water content used is greater than 25% by weight relative to the total weight of this first phase, preferably greater than 30% by weight, or even greater than 35% by weight, relative to the total weight of this first phase, and that the total content of hard wax(es), and optionally of additional wax(es), and the total content of emulsifying system(s) are such that the weight ratio of the wax(es) plus the additional wax(es)/the emulsifying system(s) is inclusively between 2 and 6, more preferentially between 3 and 5, and the colorant(s), in the knowledge that the order of addition of the compounds is unimportant, it being understood that it is, however, preferable for the water not to be present at first, in order to avoid any early evaporation; the whole mixture is emulsified with stirring at a temperature above the melting point of the wax(es) having the maximum melting point,in a second phase, to place an aqueous phase optionally comprising, or optionally being formed by, an aqueous dispersion of particles of film-forming polymers in a vessel in which the temperature is regulated inclusively between 0 and 45° C. (although a temperature of 5° C. is previously exemplified, it is understood that any temperature inclusively between 0 and 45° C., more preferentially inclusively between 0 and 20° C. will result in a composition prepared in accordance with the method according to the invention),the order of preparation of the first phase and of the second phase being unimportant,to pour the first phase, at a temperature above the maximum melting point of the wax(es), into the vessel at a temperature regulated between 0 and 45° C., and preferably between 0 and 20° C., containing the second phase,to leave to stir until the temperature of the mixture stabilizes at the regulated temperature;when a preserving system is used, it may be advantageous to add this preserving system once the mixing of the first phase and the second phase has been carried out, and preferentially once the mixture drops in temperature, advantageously once the mixture reaches the regulated temperature of between 0 and 45° C., and preferably between 0 and 20° C.,preferentially, adding a base, such as KOH, able to neutralize the associative polymer. It is important to note that some compounds which are part of this “first phase” can be prepared independently, but subsequently integrated while hot with the wax(es). For example, the pigment(s) may be prepared separately from the wax(es), but are subsequently added with the wax(es) while hot (“while hot” meaning a temperature above or equal to the melting point of the wax(es) enabling all the waxes to be in the molten state). Thus, this “first phase” comprises all the compounds which, from the beginning, or during a successive step, undergo an emulsification operation while hot with the wax(es), prior to the mixing with the aqueous phase while cold, and optionally with the aqueous dispersion of film-forming polymer(s) while cold (“while cold” meaning that the aqueous phase or the aqueous dispersion is at a temperature, which is optionally regulated, between 0 and 45° C.). This preparation protocol makes it possible, surprisingly and unexpectedly, to obtain, in particular in the presence of a high solids content, for example greater than 45%, compounds which have a smooth, glossy appearance, which have an intense colour and are easy and comfortable to apply, but which nevertheless have the desired volume effect by virtue of the incorporation of a high content of wax(es), and good water resistance by virtue of the presence of a high content of particles of film-forming polymer(s). It should be noted that a composition prepared by means of the production method as described has distinct and advantageous structural and functional characteristics in comparison with a conventional production method consisting in preparing a first phase of wax(es) which is molten at 95° C., adding the water, heated beforehand to 90-92° C., to the waxes at 95° C., then allowing it to cool, generally in the open air, to ambient temperature. Indeed, in the method according to the invention, the phase containing in particular the waxes is abruptly immersed in a cold aqueous phase, conferring advantageous properties of wax dispersion and of cosmeticity. Thus, using according to the present invention the aqueous dispersion of the film-forming polymer(s) for emulsifying the hard wax(es) is unexpected. 2/ Protocols and Results The compositions prepared are observed with the naked eye and under a microscope, and then tested on a test sample of unsullied eyelashes, by application of these compositions using a brush. The comparative composition outside the invention employing hydroxyethylcellulose as thickening polymer, even used in excess with respect to the composition according to the invention, is too fluid, making it unusable as makeup, the latter having a viscosity at 25° C. of 1.8 Pa·s measured by the Rheomat RM100® instrument. The composition according to the invention exhibits to the naked eye and under a microscope a fine emulsion with a fine and well-distributed (homogeneous) grain of wax(es). The compositions in accordance with the invention are pleasant to apply, they have a fluid texture (viscosity at 25° C. of 7.1 Pa·s measured using the Rheomat RM100® instrument), the deposit is constructed layer upon layer, the composition coats the eyelashes well, the makeup result is even, and the eyelash fringe is well developed. Furthermore, the composition obtained is nice and glossy. Moreover, the pigments are well dispersed, and the composition is intensely black. In addition, these compositions are stable at 4 and 45° C. for two months. It should be noted that the protocols for measuring the gloss and the intensity of the black that are to be carried out in the context of the present invention are described in patent application FR 2 968 978, page 44, lines 1 to 21. It is understood that, in the context of the present invention, the weight percentages given for a compound or a family of compounds are always expressed as weight of dry matter of the compound in question.
