METHOD OF CEMENTING IN A SUBTERRANEAN FORMATION USING CEMENT COMPOSITION COMPRISING LIGNITE - BASED GRAFTED COPOLYMERS BACKGROUND [0001] Cement compositions may be used in a variety of subterranean operations. For example, in subterranean well construction, a pipe string (e,g„ casing, liners, expandable tubulars, etc.) may be run into a well bore and cemented in place. The process of cementing the pipe string in place is commonly referred to as “primary cementing.” In a typical primary cementing method, a cement composition may be pumped into an annulus between the walls of the well bore and the exterior surface of the pipe string disposed therein, 'lire cement composition may set in the annular space, thereby forming an annular sheath of hardened, substantially Impermeable cement (ΐ.℮., a cement sheath) that may support and position the pipe string in the well bore and may bond the exterior surface of the pipe string to the subterranean formation. Among other things, the cement sheath surrounding the pipe string functions to prevent the migration of fluids in the annulus, as well as protecting the pipe string from corrosion. Cement compositions also may be used in remedial cementing methods, for example, to seal cracks or holes in pipe strings or cement sheaths, to seal highly permeable formation zones or fractures, to place a cement plug, and the like. [0002] One problem that may be encountered during the placement of a cement composition in a well bore is unwanted gas migration from the subterranean formation into and through the cement composition. Gas migration may be caused by the behavior of the cement composition during a transition phase in which the cement slurry changes from a true hydraulic fluid to a highly viscous mass showing some solid characteristics. When first placed in the annulus, the cement composition acts as a true liquid and thus transmits hydrostatic pressure. However, during the transition phase, certain events occur that cause the cement composition to lose its ability to transmit hydrostatic pressure. One of those events is the loss of fluid from the slurry to the subterranean formation. Another event is the development of static gel strength in the slurry. As a result, the pressure exerted on the formation, by the cement composition may fall below the pressure of the gas in the formation such that the gas may begin to migrate into and through the cement composition. When gas migration begins, the. cement composition typically has a gel strength of about 100 ib/lOO fr. The gas migration may cause flow channels to form in the cement composition. With, time, the gel strength of the cement composition increases to a value sufficient to resist the pressure exerted by the gas in the formation against the composition. At this point, the cement composition typically has a gel strength of about 500 lbj/100 fr. The cement slurry theft sets into a solid mass. [0003] Unfortunately, the flow channels formed in the cement during, .such gas migration remain in the cement composition once it has set Those flow channels can permit further migration of gas through the set cement composition. Thus, the set cement composition residing in the annulus may be ineffective at maintaining the isolation of the adjacent, subterranean formation. To overcome this problem, attempts have been made to design a cement composition having a shorter transition time, i.e., the period of time during which gas migration into the slurry can occur, which is typically the time ranging from when the gel strength of the slurry is about 100 lb# 100 ft2 to when it is about 500 IV100 tV, as measured using a Multiple Analysis Cement System (MACS'*" 11, available from Farm instrument Company) in accordance with the procedure for determining cement transition times set forth in API RP Κ)Β-δ, Recommended Practice on Determining the Static Gel Strength of Cement Formulations, dated August 1, 2010. Gas migration control additives have been developed to provide shorter transition times. One particular additive for controlling gas migration is a copolymer of sodium 2~acrylanii<kV'2~methyipropanesulfonate and N,N-dimethyIacrylaraide. While this additive can be used to control gas migration, the highest percent activity it can be effectively used as an aqueous solution is 9% by weight above which the solution becomes too viscous for the liquid additive pumps to handle. Other additives that may be used may either be too expensive or may provide transition times that may be longer than desired.

[0018] Embodiments of the cement compositions may comprise water. The water may be fresh water or salt water. Salt water generally may include one or more dissolved salts therein and may be saturated or unsaturated as desired for a particular application. Seawater or brines may be suitable for use in embodiments of the present invention. Further, the water may be present in an amount sufficient to form a pumpahle slurry. In some embodiments, the water may be included in the settable compositions of the present invention in an amount in the range of from about 30% to about 200% by weight of the cement. For example, the water may be present in an amount ranging between any of and/or including any of about 30%, about 40%, about 50%, about 75%, about 100%, about 125%, about 150%, about 175%, or about 200% by weight of the cement, in specific embodiments, the water may be included in an amount in the range of from about 40% to about 150% by weight of the cement.

A person 'having ordinary skill in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, wil l readily be able to determine the type and. amount of additive useful for a particular application and desired result. [0020] Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the cement compositions generally should have a density suitable for a particular application. By way of example, the cement composition may have a density in the range of from about 4 pounds per gallon (♦Wgar) to about 20 Ib/gal. In certain embodiments, the cement compositions may have a density in the range of from about 8 ib/gal to about 17 Ib/gal, Embodiments of the cement compositions may be foamed or un foamed or may comprise other means to reduce their densities, such as hollow microspheres, low-density elastic beads, or other density-reducing additives known in the art. For example, the cement compositions may be foamed with a gas to reduce its density and further comprise a foaming agent. Those of ordinary skill in the art, with the benefit of this disclosure, will recognize the appropriate density for a particular application. [0021] As previously mentioned, the cement: compositions may have a transition time that has been shortened in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, in some embodiments, a method of reducing a transition time of a cement composition may comprise including a lignite-based copolymer in the cement composition. Due to the presence of the lignite-based copolymer, for example, the transition times of the cement compositions may be less than or equal to about .150 minutes, hi alternative embodiments, the cement compositions may have transitions times less than or equal to about 60 minutes, alternatively less than or equal: to about. 60 minutes, alternatively less than or equal to about 50 minutes, alternatively less than or equal to about 40 minutes, alternatively less than or equal to about 30 minutes, alternatively less than or equal to about 20 minutes, or alternatively less than or equal to about .10 minutes. As a result, a cement composition may be pumped to its desired location in a well bore, e,g., the annulus, and allowed to set without being concerned that gas migration could compromise its ability to seal an area of the well bore. That is, there is insufficient time for the gas to migrate into and through the cement composition and form flow channels therein. The lignite-based copolymer thus may function as a gas migration control additive in the cement compositions. [0022] While the lignite-based copolymers may be effective at shortening transition times in a variety of cementing applications, they may be particularly effective in wells having lower bottom static temperatures (“BHST”}. By way of example, the lignite-based copolymers may suitable for use in wells drilled through shallow water flow zones where low BliSTs may be applicable, hi some embodiments, the lignite-based copolymers may be used in wells drilled in deep water fe.g„ greater than or equal to 5,000 feet). In some embodiments, the lignite-based copolymers may be used in a well bore having a BHST of less than or equal to about 100Τ, alternatively less than or equal to about 70%', and alternatively less than or equal to about 60°F. in some embodiments, the lignite-based copolymers may be used in a well bore having a BHST in a range of from about 50°F to about !Q0cF. It shook! be understood that the lignite-based copolymers may also be used in well bores having SHST’s outside these particular temperatures. [0023] As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, embodiments of the cement compositions of the present invention may be used in a variety of subterranean operations, including primary and remedial cementing. In some embodiments, a cement composition may be provided that comprises water, cement, and a lignite-based copolymer. The lignite-based copolymer may comprise a lignite backbone and grafted pendant groups comprising AMPS and DMA. In one particular embodiment, lignite based copolymer may comprise the lignite backbone in an amount of about 30% by weight and the grafted pendant groups in an amount of about 70% by weight with the grafted pendant groups having an AMPS-to-DMA molar ratio in a range of from about 10/90 to about 60/40. The cement composition may be introduced into a subterranean formation and allowed to set therein. As used herein, introducing the cement composition into a subterranean formation includes introduction into any portion of the subterranean formation, including, without limitation, into a well bore drilled into the subterranean formation, into a near well bore region surrounding the well bore, or into both. [0024] In primary cementing embodiments, for example, embodiments of the cement composition may be introduced into a well bore annuls, such between a wall of a well bore and a conduit (e.g., pipe strings, liners) located in the well bore, the well bore penetrating the subterranean formation. The cement composition may be allowed to set to form an annular sheath of hardened cement in the well bore annulus. Among other things, tire set cement composition may form a barrier, preventing the migration of fluids in the well bore. The set cement composition also may, for example, support the conduit in the well bore, [0025] In remedial cementing embodiments, a cement composition may be used, for example, in squeeze-cementing operations or in the placement of cement plugs. By way of example, the composition may be placed in a well bore to plug an opening, such as a void or c.rack, in the formation, in a gravel pack, in the conduit, in the cement sheath, and/or a microannulus between the cement sheath and the conduit. EXAMPLES [0026] To facilitate a better understanding of the present invention, the following examples of certain aspects of some embodiments are gi ven. In no way should the following examples be read to limit, or define, the entire scope of the invention. Polymer Synthesis [0027] Lignite-based polymers were synthesized such that the final polymer concentration in aqueous solution was 25 weight percent (\vi %) while maintaining a polymer/lignite weight ratio of 70/30, The AMPS/DMA molar ratio was varied, as indicated in Table 1 below. The polymerization of the 50:50 molar ratio comprised charging a 250 milliliter round bottom flask, with 20 grams of lignite (Super-Tig from BASF Corporation) followed by addition of 161,37 grams of deionized water. Next, a small amount of sodium hydroxide was added (approximately 1.48 grams) to caustieize the lignite, making it water soluble. A small amount of sodium formate (1,37 grams) was added to keep the molecular weight low enough to have a product that can be pumped in the field. Next, the solution was charged with. 65.28 grams of sodium 2-acrylamido-2-.roethy.lpropanesuIfonate (AMPS 2403 monomer, 50 wt % aqueous solution from Lubrkol Corporation) and 14.08 grams of DMA (from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC). Finally, the initiator system was added (2.58 grams of triethanolamine and 7,35 grams of a 10 w/v % sodium persulfate solution). The round bottom flask was then sealed with a rubber septa and purged with nitrogen. The solution was allowed to react for approximately 1 to 2 hours. The resulting grafted polymer solutions were then utilized for the following examples. Example 1 [0028] The following series of tests was performed to evaluate the use of a lignite-based copolymer as a gas migration control: additive for cement compositions. Seven sample cement compositions, designated Samples 1.-7» were prepared that included a lignite-based copolymer. The lignite-based copolymer used in each sample was prepared as described above. Each of the sample cement compositions comprised 600 grams of Lafarge Joppa Class Η Cement, 189.8 grams, of sea water, 12 grams of potassium chloride, 0,4 grams of EZ-FLO”* blending additive (available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc.), 29.4 grams of an inorganic cement set accelerator, and 15,8 grams of the grafted polymer solution (25 wt % aqueous solution of the lignite-based copolymer). [0029] The transition time for each sample cement composition to change from having a static gel strength of 1.00 IV100 ft2 to having a static gel strength of 500 lb/ 1.00 ft2 was determined using the following procedure. Further, the time required to reach a static gel. strength of 100 lb/100 ft1(referred to as zero gel time) of each sample cement composition was also determined. The static gel strengths were determined at 6(ΡΡ and 6,300 pounds per square inch fopsi”). The static gel strength development tests were performed using a MACS'* !! analyzer. This analyzer measures the shear resistance of a sample cement composition under downhole temperature and pressure while the sample remains essentially static. The test was conducted by mixing the sample and placing it: into the analyzer. The initial temperature was 80°F and 500 psi The sample was then stirred and cooled to the test conditions. After 42 minutes the sample reached 60°F and 6,300 psi. The stirring was continued for 90 more minutes, and the sample was then allowed to remain essentially static. The stirring paddle is rotated at a rate of about 0.216 degrees per minute while the shear resistance on the paddle is measured. The shear resistance is correlated to the static gel strength (units are lb/100 ft2). Per the above procedure, the zero gel time is the time the sample takes to reach 100 lb/100 ft2 once stirring is stopped, [0030] Fluid loss tests were also performed on each sample cement composition at room temperature and .1,000 psi differential pressure in accordance with API. Recommended Practice 10Β-2. Each sample cement composition was conditioned at 60Τ for 20 minutes followed by performing the fluid loss tests with the cells at room temperature. [0031] The results for the gel strength development and fluid loss tests are provided in the table below. The zero gel time and transition for Sample 7 having an AMPS-DM A. molar ratio of 100/0 were not determined. TABLE i Sample 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 AMPS/DMA Molar ratio 0/100 25/75 33/67 50/50 67/33 75/25 100/0 Zero Gel time (mins) 33 46 40 24 28 23 - Transition Time (mins) 51 16 19 10 37 40 - Fluid Loss (℮℮/30 mins) 56 32 26 86 121 80 481 [00321 Example 3 thus indicates that die lignite-based copolymer may function to shorten transition times. Decreasing the amount of AMPS as compared to the amount of DMA in the copolymer generally provided shorter transition times. For example, transitions times of less than 30 minutes were obtained for sample cement compositions 2-4 having an AMPS-to~DMA molar ratio of from 25/75 to 50/50. Further, Example i also indicates that the lignite-based copolymer may provide desirable levels of fluid loss control. Example 2 [0033] Two additional sample cement compositions, designated Samples 8 and 9, were prepared to compare a lignite-based copolymer to another grafted copolymer. Each of the sample cement compositions comprised 600 grams of LaFarge Joppa Class Η Cement, 189.8 grams of sea water, 12 grams of potassium chloride, 0.4 grams of EZ-FLO”” blending additive (available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc.), 29.4 grams of an inorganic cement set accelerator, and 4.7 grams of Zoneseal'^ 2000 foaming additive (available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc.). [0034] Sample 8 was a comparative composition that further comprised Ha!ad:<? 413L additive (available from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc,) in an amount of 11.8 grams. Hated* 413L additive is a grafted polymer solution that is 23% active and comprises a lignite backbone grafted with AMPS, DMA, and acrylonitrile. [0035] Sample 9 further comprised the grafted polymer solution in an amount of 11.8 grams. The grafted polymer solution was prepared as described above and comprised a lignite-based copolymer comprised a lignite backbone (30% by weight) and grafted pendants groups (70% by weight) having an AMPS-to-DMA molar ratio of 50/50, [0036] After preparation, static gel strength development tests were performed for each sample using a MACS*"' Η analyzer as described above for Example I. A plot of static gel strength development as a function of time was made for each sample. FIG. I shows static gel strength development for Sample 8. Sample 8 had a transition time of approximately 40 minutes. FIG. 2 shows static gel strength development for Sample 9. Sample 9 had a transition time of approximately i.0 minutes.
