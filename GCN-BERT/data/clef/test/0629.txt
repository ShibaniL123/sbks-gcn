I033Z84 The present invention relates to a process and apparatus for the separation of crystallizable material out of a multi component liquid system, whereby in a first phase of the process orystalllzed material is produced within that multicomponent liquid system by cooling, leaving a mother liquor, after which in subsequent phases of the process a mechanical separation (i.e. a separation without phase transformation) is accomplished between the crystallized material and the mother liquor. The process is not only technologically very important in the case of freeze concentration of fruit Juices, coffee extract and the llke, but quite generally for the separation of a wide variety of crystallizable chemical compounds from their solutions in solvents llke water, alcohol or benzene. q I i."i i i -, il: i !:::) !:g?ii:: .',y.. :i!!: "? i If is on the grounds of economy of the utmost importance that the crystals are as little as possible contaminated wlth the mother liquor. In.ose cases where the valuable material resides in the crystals, contamination with mother liquor results in a less pure produce which may necessitate a second crystallization process. On the other hand, when the substance fo be recovered is fo be found in the mother liquor, valuable material is lost by being cascaded with the crystals (e.g. coffee extract contaminating the ice crystals in a freeze concentration process). A widely useoE process for the separation between a mass of crystals and mother liquor is centrifugation. The use of a centrifuge, however, has distinct OEisaoEvan%ages. Pirs%, in the case of e.g. fruit Juices, coffee extract and the like, flavour components may be lost by volatilization; secondly, oxidation of chemically delioa component may take place leading fo off-flavours. Moreover, generally removal of %he mother liquor is no% complete in one pass. These inaoEequacles of the oentrifugation process have led fo the OEevelopment of the washing column", e.g. as described in U.S.P. Nos 3.777.S92 and 3.872.009. Presses a e slso often used e.g. in the case of freeze concentration of wine. In ai1 processes whereby the crystals are separated from the mother liquor if is important fo have the crystals or crystal agglomerates so large and so homogeneous in size that separation from the mother liquor is easily accomplished. The resistance against liquid flow through the mass of crys- le will be the lower, the larger in size the crystals or crystal agglomerates s e 1 3Z84 and the more homogeneous. This is of particular importance when a washing column is being used. The packed column of crystals or crystal agglomerates will build up considerable resistance against liquid flow if the requirements about size and homogeneity of the crystals are not sufficlêntly met, which will adversely influence the capacity of the installation. .7 :i; "?ç M Crystallization processes for the separation in substantially pure form of a crystallizable component out of a multicomponent liquid system whereby the liquid is cooled creating crystals and a mother liquor, normally involve cooling this liquid while it is thoroughly agitated (e.g. in a scraped surface heat exchanger) thereby inducing nucleation and having the nuclei grow while in suspension this is what we might Ii a dynamic process of crystallization. As fresh liquid is constantly brought into contact with the heat exchanger surface through which the cooling takes place, new nuclei are constantly formed. Numerous methods have been proposed to advantageously influence size and homogeneity of the crystals in a "ripening" process, whereby growth and recrystallization take place. In most cases these goals are not sufficiently attained, and if attained the equipment is rather bulky and the processes need careful regulation. L ï-- . . 1. I.' Y i03 ZS4 The process according to the invention for separating crystallizable material from a liquid multl-component system and recovering mother liquor thereby formed is performed batchwise in the following sequential steps: a) a first step wherein a batch of the liquid is confined at rest in a treatment space of a static heat exchanger; c) a second step in which heat is withdrawn from said batch so as to crystallize part of the crystallizable material, creating a substantially coherent matrix of crystals with mother liquor entrapped between the crystals in said matrix; a third step wherein the matrix of crystals is released from the surface to which it is attached by briefly supplying heat to that sttrface and the matrix of crystals with the mother liquor is expelled out of the treatment space of the heat exchanger; d) a fourth step wherein the material expelled in step c) is broken up sufficiently to permit mechanical separation of the resulting particles therefrom; and e) a fifth step in which the crystals in the mass obtained in step d a e transferred fo a separator therein mechanically separated from the mother liquor, and the mother liquo is recovered. The inventive concept is as simple as it is radical in its departure from the principles hitherto applied in the art at issue. 4' 1033Z84 °' i Z. '.i Now when speaking in the foregoing about a crystallizable material which we want to separate out of the multl-component system this will generally be one of the components which we watt to separate out of the system in substantially pure condition. In prickle however the crystallized crystallizable material may consist of mixed crystals (in the sense of more than one component in any crystal) this case thus not being excluded. In this case, a liquid system means any system having sufficient fluidity to be pumpable and be readily introduced in the space mentioned under a). Thus e.g. a slurry is possible, containing solid material, and a foam, containing gas or gas anoE solid material. The space in which a batch of liquid is confined may of course be a combination of spaces. It can be a treatment chamber of any equipment which may be called a "static heat exchanger" whether known in the art or not and having a treatment compartment for holding liquid and a compartment for the circulation of a heat exchange medium. A "static heat exchanger" is any heat exchanger adapted to cool batchwlse liquid introduced into its traating compartment in order to induce crystallization and not provided with appurtenances to keep the liquid in a state of agitation while the cooling is proceeding. Generally the @ace should be rather narrow in order to keep the time necessary for an aoEequate degree of solidification of the liquid in that space within an economlcally acceptable range. "Narrowness" in this sense is te be understood in such a way that the orystalllzatlon process does net need te proceed more than about 5-2 mm away from the heat exchange surface. This we wÆll call the "maximum conductive OEistance". i - 3a9.• I033Z84 Though spaces with fiat heat exchange surfaces are not excluded, very conveniently long metal tubes can be used, particularly those having an inside diameter of about 20-30 mm; thus a maximum conductive distance of about 10-15 mm. These tubes can e.g. be provided each with a mantle for cooling purposes or they may be arranged as a bundle within one shell (as in a shell-and-tube heat exchanger). Now, if we intend to use a mechanical method fo separate the crystallized crystallizable material from the rest of the multi-component system, we will continue the cooling in step b) only so far that the components which we do not want to mix with the crystallized material remain in the liquid phase, be it in solution or in suspension. This liquid phase will be embedded in a matrix of crystals. Preferably the cooling in this second step will be continued sufficiently that the matrix of crystals formed will bridge the space of the treating compartment. Generally it will be desirable fo push the mass of step c out of the space by the application of pressure. This may be accomplished by a number of ways e.g. with gas or with a piston. In many cases the pressure to expel the crystal mass from the naxTow space can conveniently be obtained by the introduction under pressure of a new batch of liquid to replace the treated batch. This means that the thiroE step c) of the cycle fbx, any one batch of liquid coincides with the first step a) of the cycle for the next batch of liquioE fo be treated. Advantageously the crystal mass will not be completely expelled out of the narrow space, but pa t of it will be left remaining at the "expelling end" of the narrow space. This will act as a "plug" to ensure proper separation between a treated batch and the next one yet to be treated. Extraction anoE supply of heat through the heat exchange surface as mentloneå above can be performed in any conventional way, but in a preferred embooEiment of the invention using e.g. tubes as OEescribed above, heat is withd awn in the first step of the cycle by connecting the space around the tubes with the evaporation chamber of a refrigerating unit and heat is supplied in the third step of the cycle by connecting said space with he i condensation chamber of the refrigerating unit. Breaking up of the material extracted from the narrow treating space can be performed in any conventional way, but advantageously this is done e.g. by a set of knives attached to a rotatable disk placed at that end of the space where the material emerges in,the third step c). The mixture of crystals and mother liquor obtained in the fourth step d) is often not sufficiently fluid to be easily fed to the separatory device which has to separate the crystals from the mother liquor. v? .'7 ;«ç t I033Z84 If this holds true advantageously the broken up mass may therefore be transformed into a pumpable slurry or suspension by mixing it with mother liquor which is recycled from the separatory device. The process as described above is not continuous. As the second step of the process in which heat is withdrawn so as to ensure crystallization takes much more time than the third step in which the crystal mass in the narrow space is extracted from the treating space, advantageously a buffer will have to be created of treated material to be fed to the separatory device. It is, however, possible to obviate this by parallel connection of a series of treating units and having each unit start its performance a little later than the foregoing one. If, e.g. we have ten units the first may be performing the extracting step c) (and at the same time step a) while the nine other will be performing the crystallizing step b). After the first unit has finished the expelling step, the second unit will start with expelling. The first unit will have ended its second round of cooling when the tenth unit is through with its expelling step. In this way a virtually continuous stream of material may be kept feeding the separatory device. "'iX ,'- " i ',ï • 1033 84 According to another aspect of the invention, apparatus is provided specifically adapted for use in the processes described above. The apparatus according te the invention for separating part of the crystallizable component in substantially pure condition from a multicomponent liquid system will comprise the following operationally connected parts: a) a static heat exchanger for confining a batch of said liquid; b) means for withdrawing from said heat exchanger sufficient heat, to crystallize part of the crystallizable material and thereby create a substantially coherent matrix of crystals with mother liquor entrapped between the crystals in said matrix; c) means for releasing from thesurface of said heat exchanger crystals attached thereto, said means supplying heat to such surface such that the matrix of crystals with the mother liquor is expelled from the heat exchanger d) means for sub-dividing the material expelled in step c sufficiently to free the mother liquor from said matrix and to permit mechanical separation of the resulting particles therefrom; and e) means for receiving and separating the crystals from the mother liquor and for recovering the mother liquor from same. Reiterating what has been already said above, under "static heat exchanger" we understand an heat exchanger adapted to cool batchwise liquid introduced into its treatment compartment in order fo induce crystallization and not provided with appartenances to keep the liquid in a state of "L" 1033Z84 'ì agitation while the cooling is proceeding. A multiplicity of these static heat exchangers may be arranged in parallel connection and provided with means adapted for sequential functioning (as already explained above), in order to obtain a virtually continuous output of treated material. Each of the static heat exchangers may be provided with separate means for subdividing the output of this heat exchanger, but a multiplicity of co-operating static heat exchangers may also be provided with one means for subdividing their output. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the static heat exchanger will be tubular. In its simplest form this will be one metal tube, but conveniently it will comprise a bundle of parallelly arranged tubes. These tubes may be each surrounded by a tubiform mantle providing a chamber for the circulation of the heat exchange medium (the coolant from the refrigeration unit) or they may be enclosed together in a common shell providing a common compartment for the heat exchange medium e.g. as in a shell and tube heat exchanger. Conveniently the inside diameter of the tubes will be about i0mm. The means to subdivide the material expelled in step c will conveniently comprise a disk provided with knives and means to rotate that disk. This disk will preferably be located just outside that end of the tubes where the matrix of crystals emerge when they are released and extracted from the tubes. Additional to the knives for cutting and breaking up the "column" of material emerging from the tubes the disk will conveniently be t provided with slots as passageways for the particles created by this cutting action. It is advantageous to place the disk just below the bottom end of the tubes while these, in use, will preferably be in a substantially vertical position. A possible arrangement when a multiplicity of co-operating static heat exchangers are provided with a single means for subdividing their output is for each static heat exchanger to comprise a parallel bundle of tubes and the tubes to be circularly arranged between two concentric shells, the combined bundles being provided at one end with a common disk at right angles to the axes of the tubes, and means to rotate said disk, the disk being provided with knives adapted to break up a matrix of crystals emerging from the tubes when the apparatus is in operation. Processes and apparatus embodying the invention may be respectively more efficient and easier to regulate, and less bulky than is known in the prior art. ù ï. Gï •' A 1o33z84 Examples of apparatuses according to the invention and the way these operate are illustrated in the drawings which follow, in which: Fig. 1 is a schematical representation of an apparatus according to the invention connected to a washing column; Fig. 2 is a cross section of the lower part of the heat exchanger; and Fig. 3 is a top view of the cutting disk and a drawing of a portion of the disk in perspective. As stated above, Fig. 1 is a schematical representation of an apparatus according to the invention connected to a washing column and suitable e.g. for the freeze concentration of aqueous systems such as coffee extract and fruit juices. In this figure the following parts are shown: - a feed pump (2) with constant out-put, to dose a predetermined volume of liquid for each batch to be treated, fed from storage vessel (i) - a number of identical shell and tube heat exchangers (3) to (12) mounted in parallel and connected to a central feed line by valves (16) to (25). Below the heat exchangers an equal number of grinding means are provided for breaking up the columns of ice and concentrate and simultaneously mixing the broken up ice conglomerates with recirculated concentrate - a washing column (13), represented schematically for separating ice and concentrate - a concentrate recylcing pump (14) - a concentrate outlet (15) - a melt water outlet (34) - a concentrate recycle line (26) - 'buffering' vessles (36) and (37) I033Z84 ¢I ,iI ï , ." j?'. .'h." :ï "i 5' ' - a safety valve (38). The process as it takes place in one heat exchanger will be described in a general way. At the end of each freeze cycle of heat exchanger (3) pump (2) pumps a given quantity of feed solution from storage tank (i) through line (35) to shell and tube heat exchanger (3), valves (17) to (25) being closed. The columns of ice crystals and enclosed concentrate which have formed in the heat exchanger tubes during freezing are simultaneously forced out of the tubes. The columns of ice have first been released from the tube walls by briefly applying heat as described below. A new freezing cycle starts when only a relatively small frozen 'plug' (28) remains in each tube (27) of the heat exchanger (3). At that moment valve (16) is closed and coolant from the refrigerating unit (not shown) is introduced into the space between the shell and the tubes of heat exchanger (3) through valved line (29). The remaining plugs of ice are immediately frozen to the walls of the tubes (27) and the fresh solution starts to crystallize in the tubes. At the end of each freezing cycle heat exchanger (3) is briefly connected to the condensation chamber of the refrigerating unit instead of to the evaporation chamber, a thin film of liquid being formed between column and tube wall. After valve (16) has been re-opened, the columns of ice and concentrate are replaced by fresh solution as described above. The frozen columns expelled by the fresh feed solution are broken up upon leaving the tubes by the knives (30) mentioned Il I I 1033Z84 above. Through apertures in the disk the mixture of ice particles and concentrate passes to mixing vessel (32), which contains concentrated mother liquor. The cutting position of the knives and the speed of the rotation of the disk control the size of the ice particles. The speed of rotation of the disk, in combination with the number of knives, determines the time required to force out the columns of ice. The rotating disk is driven by a motor (33) located outside the heat exchanger. The mixture of ice particles and concentrate enters the mixing vessel at regular intervals and they must be transformed into a slurry which can easily be processed by the separating apparatus, which in this embodiment of the invention is a washing column (13) schematically shown. The percentage of ice in the slurry should preferably be about 25%-35% w.w. To this end concentrate recycling pump (14) continuously circulates part of the concentrate so that in the mixing vessel the mixture of ice partïcles and concentrate is mixed with recycled concentrate in the right proportion. The slurry is immediately transported to the washing column. The shell and tube heat exchangers are connected in such a way that at any given moment one heat exchanger is engaged in the expelling step, while the other exchangers are engaged in the cooling step. Thus a suspension of ice and concentrate is for all practical purposes continuously fed to the washing column and the refrigerating unit is loaded evenly. The concentrate discharged through outlet (15) and the melting water discharged through outlet (34) taken together have the same composition as the i k [« "ï. .,ve• ïi feed solution. 10SS 84 The melter of the washing column is connected fo the condenser of the refrigerating unit and so also is the one heat exchanger in which a film of liquid is being formed 1o enable expulsion of the matrix of ice ozTstals. Fig. 2 is a cross section of the lower part of the heat exchanger with the " cutting disk", according fo a plane parallel fo the axis of e tubes. Ai (40) %ho wall of the tube is shown at (59) the wall of the shell enclosing the tubes. Ai (41) we see the opening for the introduction of coolant. The tubes ai their bottom end are fastened fo the tube sheet (52). :i The disk (42) is screwed on the axle (50) the upper end of which is threaded (55). The axle (50) passes through the bottom sheet (51). A% (45) one of the knilres protruding out the upper surface of the disk is shown. The distance between the cutting edge of the knives and the bottom end of the tubes can be adjusted by variation of the thln metal »ing, (49). The inlet anoE outlet for the reolroulated mother liquor are shown ai respectively (46) anoE (47), while (48) is the "mixing chamber" where the crystal agglomerates are mixed wl%h the reciroulateoE mother liquor fo form a pump le slurry. In figure 3 we see a top view on the "cutting disk" (42) and a drawing of part of the disk in perspective. In this perspective drawing the space (44) for inserting the replaceable knife (43) is Shown for only 9 knife. At (45) we see a slot through which the particles of crystal agglomerates crea ted by the action of the cutting knives pass through the OEisk. In the underfollowlng examples will be given of processes accomplished wl%h the apparatus described above. , X. J ÆO33î 84 Example 1 A sugar solution containing 10% dry solid is concentrated to about 20% d.s. (specific mass of 10% d.s. is 1.04 kg/l, Tequi1 ibrium = -0.6°C; specific mass 20% d.s. is 1.09 kg/l, Tequi1 ibrium= -1.5°C). The apparatus used is represented in the figures i, 2 and 3. Each heat exchanger is operated semi-continuously with a cycle time of 30 minutes, made up of a freezing time of about 26 minutes, a melting time of about 1 minute and an ejection time of about 3 minutes. The crystallizer consists of i0 shell and tube heat exchangers, each containing 6 stainless steel tubes with an internal diameter of 25 mm and a length of 3000 mm. Below each heat exchanger a rotating disk, provided with 6 knives with a thickness of 5 mm is mounted. The knives protrude 1.8 mm above the disk. The distance between the edge of each knife and the bottom end of the tubes is 3 mm. The disk is provided with apertures through which the ice particles pass into a mixing vessel below. The disk rotates at a speed of 79 revolutions a minute. The total holding capacity of the tubes is about 8.8 1 per heat exchanger. At the end of the ejection period, frozen plugs of a length of about 45 cm, which approximately equal 1.3 i, remain in the heat exchanger. At that moment there is about 7.5 1 fresh extract of 10% d.s. in the space above the frozen plugs. This new batch of extract weighs about 7.8 kg and has a temperature of 0°C. The extract is cooled by means of evaporating coolant. iV. 5" IV «., v. 1O33254 !.í The temperature difference between the contents of the tubes and the evaporation chamber formed by the space between the shell and the tubes is kept at about 8°C. 26 minutes after the start of freezing the original 7.8 kg extract has been transformed into about 3.9 kg ice and about 3.9 kg concentrated extract with a d.s. content of about 20%. The temperature of the ice columns is then about -1.5°C. The space between the shell and the tubes, i.e. the evaporation chamber of the refrigerating unit, is connected to the condensation chamber of the refrigerating unit so that heat is briefly applied to the tubes. A thin film of liquid forms on the walls of the tubes. Then the valve in the feed line with fresh feed solution is opened, so that the pressure of the feed pump is applied to the columns of ice and enclosed concentrate. The pressure differential across the length of the heat exchanger is about atm. Owing to the difference in pressure the frozen columns are expelled from the tubes for a distance of about 2.55 m and are simultaneously broken up by the rotating disk with knives. The ice conglomerates formed are mixed with recycled concentrate in the mixing vessel to give a slurry with an ice concentration of about 30%. The slurry is transported to the washing column. When the ice column has been expelled far enough, a new freezing cycle starts in the heat exchanger, after the valve in the feed line has been closed. At the same time expulsion il v. starts in the next heat exchanger. At any given moment 9 heat exchangers are freezing extract and 1 heat exchanger is releasing and expelling the ice columns formed. The total concentrating capacity of the apparatus is about 75 1 fresh extract every minutes, i.e. 150 1 fresh extract per hour. The washing column removes about 78 kg ice per hour. The capacity of the recycling pump is about 96 1 per hour (104 kg concentrate per hour). i! :i 11f ,i :t -ì 4' 1O33284 Example 2 Coffee extract containing 10% dry solid is concentrated to about 34% dry solid (specific mass of 10% dry solid is 1.04 kg/l, specific mass of 34% dry solid is 1.16 kg/l). The apparatus used and its operation are described in example i. The only differences are the following: 26 minutes after the start of freezing the original 7.8 kg extract has been transformed into about 5.5 kg ice and about 2.3 kg concentrated extract with a d.s. content of about 34%. The total concentrating capacity of the apparatus is about 1 fresh extract every 30 minutes, i.e. 150 1 fresh extract per hour. The washing column removes about 110 kg ice per hour. The capacity of the recycling pump is about 182 1 per hour (211 kg concentrate per hour). ç:i: çii:! i 1-- .... lOGeZ84 THE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION IN WHICH AN EXCLUSIVE PROPERTY OR PRIVILEGE IS CLAIMED ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS: I.
