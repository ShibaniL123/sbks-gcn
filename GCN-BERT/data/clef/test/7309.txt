190.6: [5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-2-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-methyl acetate
18.2 mg (0.45 mmol) of sodium hydride is added in portions to 85 mg (0.4 mmol) of 5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-3,4-dihydro-1H-pyrimidin-2-one in solution in 4.5 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide. After stirring for 2 min at room temperature, 40 Î¼L (0.45 mmol) of methylchloroacetate is added. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 40 min and then hydrolysed and diluted with ethyl acetate. The product is extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phases are combined, washed once with water and once with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride, then dried over magnesium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. 100 mg (89%) of [5-(2,3-difluorophenyl)-3-methyl-2-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-methyl acetate is obtained in the form of a white solid.
