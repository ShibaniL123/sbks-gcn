No. 61/678,190, filed Aug. 1, 2012; each of which is fully incorporated by reference herein. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides novel aminoheteroaryl 7-hydroxy-spiropiperidine indolinyl compounds, and analogues thereof, which are selective inhibitors of the human P2Y1 receptor. The invention also provides for various pharmaceutical compositions of the same and methods for treating diseases responsive to modulation of P2Y1 receptor activity. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Purinoreceptors bind to and are activated by a variety of both ribosylated (nucleotide) and non-ribosylated (nucleoside) purines. This distinction has been used to classify these receptors into two broad groups: the P1 receptors (A1, A2a, A2b, and A3), which bind to and are activated by the nucleoside adenosine, and the P2 receptors, which comprise a second, more diverse class of receptors which are activated by a wide variety of nucleotides including ATP, ADP, UTP, and UDP. The P2 receptors can be further subdivided into two distinct types of receptors; the ionotropic P2X receptors that mediate cation flux across cellular membranes in response to ATP and the metabotropic P2Y family of receptors which are G-protein coupled receptors. In humans, the P2Y family of receptors is generally considered to consist of seven distantly related members; P2Y1, P2Y2, P2Y4, P2Y6, P2Y11, P2Y12, and P2Y13 (Boeynaems, J. M. et al., Drug Development Research, 52:187-189 (2001)). In addition, an eighth receptor, P2Y14, has been considered by some to be a member of this class although it does not respond to ribosylated nucleotides and is activated by UDP-glucose (Abbracchio, M. P. et al., Trends Pharmacol. Sci., 24:52-55 (2003)). Several studies have suggested that modulators of specific members of the P2Y family of receptors could have therapeutic potential for the treatment of a variety of disorders (for review see Burnstock, G. et al., J. Pharm. Exp. Ther., 295:862-869 (2000)), including diabetes, cancer, CF, and treatment of ischemia-reperfusion injury (Abbracchio M. P. et al., Pharmacol. Ther., 64:445-475 (1994)). P2Y1 receptors, almost ubiquitous among human organs (Jassens, R. et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm., 221:588-593 (1996)) have been identified on microglia (Norenberg, W. et al., Br. J. Pharmacol., 111:942-950 (1994)) and on astrocytes (Salter, M. W. et al., J. Neurosc., 15:2961-2971 (1995)). Extracellular ATP activates microglial and/or astrocytes via P2Y receptors and leads directly to the release of inflammatory mediators. Microglia and astrocytes are believed to play a role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease and other CNS inflammatory disorders such as stroke and multiple sclerosis. Two members of the P2Y family, P2Y1 and P2Y12, are of particular interest as they have now both been shown to act as important receptors for ADP in platelets (Jin, J. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 95:8070-8074 (1998)). ADP is a key activator of platelets and platelet activation is known to play a pivotal role in thrombus formation under conditions of high shear stress such as those found in the arterial circulation. In addition, more recent data has suggested that platelet activation may also play a role in mediating thrombus formation under lower shear stress such as that found in the venous circulation. ADP activates platelets by simultaneously interacting with both P2Y1 and P2Y12 to produce two separate intracellular signals which synergize together to produce complete platelet activation (Jin, J. et al., J. Biol. Chem., 273:2030-2034 (1998)). The first signal arises from ADP driven activation of the P2Y1 receptor and can most easily be tracked by measuring the transitory increase in intracellular free Ca+2. This signal appears to mediate the initial shape change reaction and to initiate the process of platelet activation. The second signal appears to be derived from ADP activation of the P2Y12 receptor and serves to consolidate the process and produce an irreversible platelet aggregate. Using three structurally related but distinct inhibitors of P2Y1 (A3P5P, A3P5PS, and A2P5P), Daniel, J. L. et al. (J. Biol. Chem., 273:2024-2029 (1998)), Savi, P. et al. (FEBS Letters, 422:291-295 (1998)), and Hechler, B. et al. (Br. J. Haematol., 103:858-866 (1998)) were the first to publish the observation that the inhibition of P2Y1 activity alone could block ADP-driven aggregation independently of the P2Y12 receptor. Although inhibition of platelet reactivity is often thought of as firm evidence of an anti-thrombotic activity, these antagonists lacked the necessary pharmacological properties for in vivo study. The first direct demonstration that inhibition of P2Y1 activity could lead to an anti-thrombotic effect in vivo was reported by Leon, C. et al., Circulation, 103:718-723 (2001), in a model of thromboplastin induced thromboembolism using both a P2Y1 knock-out mouse and the P2Y1 antagonist MRS-2179 (Baurand, A. et al., Cardiovascular Drug Reviews, 21:67-76 (2003)). These results were subsequently extended to include the inhibition of both venous and arterial thrombosis in the rat (Lenain, N. et al., J. Thromb. Haemost., 1:1144-1149 (2003)) and the confirmation of the phenotype of the P2Y1 knock-out mouse in a second laboratory using an independently derived animal (Fabre, J-E. et al., Nature Medicine, 5:1199-1202 (1999)). These studies highlighted the need for more potent and selective P2Y1 antagonists and recently, using the P2Y1 antagonist MRS-2500 (Hechler, B. et al., J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther., 316:556-563 (2006)) succeeded in demonstrating strong antithrombotic activity for a selective P2Y1 antagonist in the mouse. Taken together, these data suggest that the discovery of novel P2Y1 antagonists with improved pharmaceutical characteristics could have significant utility in the treatment of a variety of thrombotic or thromboembolic disorders (see Gachet, C. et al., Blood Cell, Molecules and Disease, 36:223-227 (2006) for a recent review). U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0293281 A1 published Dec. 28, 2006 discloses a series of P2Y1 antagonists including spiropiperidine indolinyl of the following formula: wherein ring A is C6-10 aryl substituted with 0-5 R1, or a 5- to 10-membered heterocycle comprising: carbon atoms and 1-4 heteroatoms selected from N, NR11, O, and S(O)p, wherein said heterocycle is substituted with 0-5 R1; ring B is phenyl or naphthyl substituted with 0-4 R7, or a 5- to 10-membered heteroaryl comprising: carbon atoms and 1-4 ring heteroatoms selected from N, NR11, S(O)p, and O, wherein said heteroaryl is substituted with 0-4 R7; one of the ring D groups is substituted with 0-5 R6a; wherein D1 is a 5- to 7-membered carbocycle or a 5-6-membered heterocycle comprising: carbon atoms and 0-3 ring heteroatoms selected from N, NR11, O, and S(O)p, and 0-2 carbonyl groups, and 0-3 double bonds; one of the W groups is NR18; R6a is a variable defined therein; alternatively, when two R6a groups are attached to the same carbon atom, together with the carbon atom to which they are attached, they form a 3- to 7-membered carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring comprising: carbon atoms and 0-3 heteroatoms selected from N, NR11, O, Si, and S(O)p, 0-1 carbonyl and 0-3 ring double bonds, wherein said carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring is substituted with 0-3 Rb; and other variables are defined therein. It is desirable to find new compounds with improved pharmacological characteristics compared with known P2Y1 antagonists. For example, it is desirable to find new compounds with improved antiplatelet activity in the platelet aggregation functional assay and good binding affinity in the P2Y1 binding assay SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present disclosure provides novel aminoheteroaryl 7-hydroxy-spiropiperidine indolinyl compounds and their analogues, including stereoisomers, tautomers, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or solvates thereof, which are useful as selective inhibitors of the P2Y1 receptor.

Furthermore, any element of an embodiment is meant to be combined with any and all other elements from any embodiment to describe an additional embodiment. III. Chemistry Throughout the specification and the appended claims, a given chemical formula or name shall encompass all stereo and optical isomers and racemates thereof where such isomers exist. Unless otherwise indicated, all chiral (enantiomeric and diastereomeric) and racemic forms are within the scope of the invention. Many geometric isomers of C═C double bonds, C═N double bonds, ring systems, and the like can also be present in the compounds, and all such stable isomers are contemplated in the present invention. Cis- and trans- (or E- and Z-) geometric isomers of the compounds of the present invention are described and may be isolated as a mixture of isomers or as separated isomeric forms. The present compounds can be isolated in optically active or racemic forms. Optically active forms may be prepared by resolution of racemic forms or by synthesis from optically active starting materials. All processes used to prepare compounds of the present invention and intermediates made therein are considered to be part of the present invention. When enantiomeric or diastereomeric products are prepared, they may be separated by conventional methods, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. Depending on the process conditions the end products of the present invention are obtained either in free (neutral) or salt form. Both the free form and the salts of these end products are within the scope of the invention. If so desired, one form of a compound may be converted into another form. A free base or acid may be converted into a salt; a salt may be converted into the free compound or another salt; a mixture of isomeric compounds of the present invention may be separated into the individual isomers. Compounds of the present invention, free form and salts thereof, may exist in multiple tautomeric forms, in which hydrogen atoms are transposed to other parts of the molecules and the chemical bonds between the atoms of the molecules are consequently rearranged. It should be understood that all tautomeric forms, insofar as they may exist, are included within the invention. As used herein, the term “alkyl” or “alkylene” is intended to include both branched and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms. For example, “C1 to C6 alkyl” or “C1-6 alkyl” (or alkylene), is intended to include C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 alkyl groups. Alkyl group can be unsubstituted or substituted with at least one hydrogen being replaced by another chemical group. Example alkyl groups include, but are not limited to, methyl (Me), ethyl (Et), propyl (e.g., n-propyl and isopropyl), butyl (e.g., n-butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl), and pentyl (e.g., n-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl). “Alkenyl” or “alkenylene” is intended to include hydrocarbon chains of either straight or branched configuration having the specified number of carbon atoms and one or more, preferably one to two, carbon-carbon double bonds that may occur in any stable point along the chain. For example, “C2 to C6 alkenyl” or “C2-6 alkenyl” (or alkenylene), is intended to include C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 alkenyl groups. Examples of alkenyl include, but are not limited to, ethenyl, 1-propenyl, 2-propenyl, 2-butenyl, 3-butenyl, 2-pentenyl, 3, pentenyl, 4-pentenyl, 2-hexenyl, 3-hexenyl, 4-hexenyl, 5-hexenyl, 2-methyl-2-propenyl, and 4-methyl-3-pentenyl. The term “alkoxy” or “alkyloxy” refers to an —O-alkyl group. “C1 to C6 alkoxy” or “C1-6 alkoxy” (or alkyloxy), is intended to include C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 alkoxy groups. Example alkoxy groups include, but are not limited to, methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy (e.g., n-propoxy and isopropoxy), and t-butoxy. Similarly, “alkylthio” or “thioalkoxy” represents an alkyl group as defined above with the indicated number of carbon atoms attached through a sulphur bridge; for example methyl-S— and ethyl-S—. “Halo” or “halogen” includes fluoro, chloro, bromo, and iodo. “Haloalkyl” is intended to include both branched and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms, substituted with 1 or more halogens. Examples of haloalkyl include, but are not limited to, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, trichloromethyl, pentafluoroethyl, pentachloroethyl, 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl, heptafluoropropyl, and heptachloropropyl. Examples of haloalkyl also include “fluoroalkyl” that is intended to include both branched and straight-chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having the specified number of carbon atoms, substituted with 1 or more fluorine atoms. “Haloalkoxy” or “haloalkyloxy” represents a haloalkyl group as defined above with the indicated number of carbon atoms attached through an oxygen bridge. For example, “C1 to C6 haloalkoxy” or “C1-6 haloalkoxy”, is intended to include C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 haloalkoxy groups. Examples of haloalkoxy include, but are not limited to, trifluoromethoxy, 2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy, and pentafluorothoxy. Similarly, “haloalkylthio” or “thiohaloalkoxy” represents a haloalkyl group as defined above with the indicated number of carbon atoms attached through a sulphur bridge; for example trifluoromethyl-S—, and pentafluoroethyl-S—. The term “counter ion” is used to represent a negatively charged species such as chloride, bromide, hydroxide, acetate, and sulfate. As referred to herein, the term “substituted” means that at least one hydrogen atom is replaced with a non-hydrogen group, provided that normal valencies are maintained and that the substitution results in a stable compound. When a substituent is keto (i.e., ═O), then 2 hydrogens on the atom are replaced. Keto substituents are not present on aromatic moieties. When a ring system (e.g., carbocyclic or heterocyclic) is said to be substituted with a carbonyl group or a double bond, it is intended that the carbonyl group or double bond be part (i.e., within) of the ring. Ring double bonds, as used herein, are double bonds that are formed between two adjacent ring atoms (e.g., C═C, C═N, or N═N). In cases wherein there are nitrogen atoms (e.g., amines) on compounds of the present invention, these may be converted to N-oxides by treatment with an oxidizing agent (e.g., mCPBA and/or hydrogen peroxides) to afford other compounds of this invention. Thus, shown and claimed nitrogen atoms are considered to cover both the shown nitrogen and its N-oxide (N→O) derivative. When any variable occurs more than one time in any constituent or formula for a compound, its definition at each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Thus, for example, if a group is shown to be substituted with 0-3 R groups, then said group may optionally be substituted with up to three R groups, and at each occurrence R is selected independently from the definition of R. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. When a bond to a substituent is shown to cross a bond connecting two atoms in a ring, then such substituent may be bonded to any atom on the ring. When a substituent is listed without indicating the atom in which such substituent is bonded to the rest of the compound of a given formula, then such substituent may be bonded via any atom in such substituent. Combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds. The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is employed herein to refer to those compounds, materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms that are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of human beings and animals without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and/or other problem or complication, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. As used herein, “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refer to derivatives of the disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic groups such as amines; and alkali or organic salts of acidic groups such as carboxylic acids. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, and nitric; and the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic, lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, and isethionic. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be synthesized from the parent compound that contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two; generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of suitable salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition, Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Pa. (1990), the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. In addition, compounds of Formula (I), Formula (II), or Formula (III) may have prodrug forms. Any compound that will be converted in vivo to provide the bioactive agent (i.e., a compound of Formula (I), Formula (II) or Formula (III)) is a prodrug within the scope and spirit of the invention. Various forms of prodrugs are well known in the art. For examples of such prodrug derivatives, see: a) Bundgaard, H., ed., Design of Prodrugs, Elsevier (1985), and Widder, K. et al., eds., Methods in Enzymology, 112:309-396, Academic Press (1985); b) Bundgaard, H., Chapter 5, “Design and Application of Prodrugs,” Krosgaard-Larsen, P. et al., eds., A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, pp. 113-191, Harwood Academic Publishers (1991); c) Bundgaard, H., Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev., 8:1-38 (1992); d) Bundgaard, H. et al., J. Pharm. Sci., 77:285 (1988); and e) Kakeya, N. et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull., 32:692 (1984). Compounds containing a carboxy group can form physiologically hydrolyzable esters that serve as prodrugs by being hydrolyzed in the body to yield compounds of the present invention per se. Such prodrugs are preferably administered orally since hydrolysis in many instances occurs principally under the influence of the digestive enzymes. Parenteral administration may be used where the ester per se is active, or in those instances where hydrolysis occurs in the blood. Examples of physiologically hydrolyzable esters of compounds of the present invention include C1 to C6 alkyl, C1 to C6 alkylbenzyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, indanyl, phthalyl, methoxymethyl, C1-6 alkanoyloxy-C1-6 alkyl (e.g., acetoxymethyl, pivaloyloxymethyl or propionyloxymethyl), C1 to C6 alkoxycarbonyloxy-C1 to C6 alkyl (e.g., methoxycarbonyl-oxymethyl or ethoxycarbonyloxymethyl, glycyloxymethyl, phenylglycyloxymethyl, (5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-yl)-methyl), and other well known physiologically hydrolyzable esters used, for example, in the penicillin and cephalosporin arts. Such esters may be prepared by conventional techniques known in the art. Preparation of prodrugs is well known in the art and described in, for example, King, F. D., ed., Medicinal Chemistry: Principles and Practice, The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK (1994); Testa, B. et al., Hydrolysis in Drug and Prodrug Metabolism. Chemistry, Biochemistry and Enzymology, VCHA and Wiley-VCH, Zurich, Switzerland (2003); Wermuth, C. G., ed., The Practice of Medicinal Chemistry, Academic Press, San Diego, Calif. (1999). The present invention is intended to include all isotopes of atoms occurring in the present compounds. Isotopes include those atoms having the same atomic number but different mass numbers. By way of general example and without limitation, isotopes of hydrogen include deuterium and tritium. Isotopes of carbon include 13C and 14C.

The compounds of the present invention can be synthesized using the methods described below, together with synthetic methods known in the art of synthetic organic chemistry, or by variations thereon as appreciated by those skilled in the art. Preferred methods include, but are not limited to, those described below. The reactions are performed in a solvent or solvent mixture appropriate to the reagents and materials employed and suitable for the transformations being effected. It will be understood by those skilled in the art of organic synthesis that the functionality present on the molecule should be consistent with the transformations proposed. This will sometimes require a judgment to modify the order of the synthetic steps or to select one particular process scheme over another in order to obtain a desired compound of the invention. It will also be recognized that another major consideration in the planning of any synthetic route in this field is the judicious choice of the protecting group used for protection of the reactive functional groups present in the compounds described in this invention. An authoritative account describing the many alternatives to the trained practitioner is Greene et al. (Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis, Wiley-Interscience, 3rd Edition (1999)). The novel compounds of this invention may be prepared using the reactions and techniques described in this section. Also, in the description of the synthetic methods described below, it is to be understood that all proposed reaction conditions, including choice of solvent, reaction atmosphere, reaction temperature, duration of the experiment and workup procedures, are chosen to be the conditions standard for that reaction, which should be readily recognized by one skilled in the art. Restrictions to the substituents that are compatible with the reaction conditions will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art and alternate methods must then be used. It will also be recognized that another major consideration in the planning of any synthetic route in this field is the judicious choice of the protecting group used for protection of the reactive functional groups present in the compounds described in this invention. An authoritative account describing the many alternatives to the trained practitioner is Greene et al. (Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis, Wiley and Sons (1991)). Schemes 1-12 describe synthetic routes of making compounds of the invention. Schemes 1 and 2 describe several preparations of the amine intermediate 1 and Schemes 3-6 illustrate the possible preparations of the substituted indoline derivative 3 via a variety of methods from commercially available starting materials or can readily be prepared from commercially available materials by methods known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Scheme 7 exemplifies the preparations of the amine intermediates 37 in the present invention wherein, R3 is a halogen group, such as Cl, or trifluoromethyl group. Schemes 8-11 illustrate the preparations of compounds in the present invention wherein A ring is a substituted five- or six-membered heteroaryl. Scheme 12 elaborates further functionalization of R3 of the molecule when R3 is a trifluoromethyl group to synthesize compounds of the present invention wherein R3 is a nitrile or an ester group. Scheme 1 outlines one possible preparation of aniline intermediates 1, which proceeds by aromatic nucleophilic substitution followed by reduction. Nitro phenyl derivatives or nitro pyridinyl derivatives 2, substituted in the ortho position with a halogen (such as chlorine or fluorine), are commercially available or can readily be prepared by one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. They can be reacted with NH-containing cyclics 3 as nucleophiles to provide the corresponding compounds 4. Typical reaction conditions involve the reaction of a nucleophile and a halonitro aryl/heteroaryl derivative either in an organic solvent such as THF, DMF, toluene, dioxane or n-butanol, or under neat condition, in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate, cesium carbonate, triethylamine, sodium/potassium tert-butoxide, or DIEA. The reaction temperature is usually between room temperature and reflux condition. Reaction conditions can be chosen based on the nucleophilicity of 3 and/or halogen difference. Microwave irradiation and/or heating at higher temperature can also be used to accelerate the rate of reaction. Following aromatic nucleophilic substitution, the resulting nitro derivatives 4 can be reduced to the corresponding anilines. Typical conditions include hydrogenation in the presence of a metal catalyst such as palladium or platinum. Other conditions include treatment with reducing agents such as SnCl2 or Zinc or iron powder with ammonium chloride. On the other hand, the aniline intermediates 1 can be synthesized via Cu or Pd chemistry (for a review paper, see Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 42:5400-5449) between 1,2-substituted aryl/heteroaryl halides 5 and NH-containing cyclics 3 followed by deprotection or functional transformation of intermediates 6 as exemplified in Scheme 2. Microwave irradiation can also be used to accelerate the rate of reaction in the coupling step when using the Pd or Cu chemistry. For example, the esters 7 can be coupled with the amines 3 via the Chan-Lam chemistry in the presence of Cu catalyst (Cu(OAc)2, Et3N or Py, CH2Cl2, for a review paper, see Synthesis, 829-856 (2011)) to form the intermediates 8, which can be hydrolyzed, followed by the Curtius rearrangement to afford the protected amines 9. Removal of the amine protecting group in 9 can give the desired aniline intermediates 1. On the other hand, coupling of the bromo nitro compounds 10 with the amines 3 via Buchwald-Hartwig amination in the presence of a palladium (0) catalyst such as tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2(dba)3) or a palladium (II) catalyst such as palladium acetate (Pd(OAc)2) with a phosphine ligand such as BINAP or Xantphos and a base such as Cs2CO3 or t-BuONa, can afford the nitro intermediates 11. Reduction of the nitro group in 11 with a variety of reducing reagents such as Zn, Fe, Pd/C—H2, SnCl2, Na2S2O4, can afford the desired aniline intermediates 1. Compounds of the present invention wherein the amine intermediates 3 are substituted indoline derivatives, can be prepared by using the methods shown in Schemes 3-8 and by using methods known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Scheme 3 illustrates the preparation of the indoline derivatives 3 via Fischer indole synthesis followed by reduction of the indolenine intermediates. Substituted phenyl hydrazines 12 are commercially available or can readily be prepared from commercially available materials by methods known to one skilled in the art of organic synthesis. Thus, Fischer indole reaction of the substituted phenyl hydrazines 12 and the aldehydes 13 under acidic conditions (e.g., H2SO4, HCl, HOAc, TFA, MsOH, ZnCl2) at reaction temperature from 0° C. to refluxing temperature in solvent such as CH2Cl2, toluene, EtOH, HOAc, 1,4-dioxane, can yield the indolenine intermediates 15, followed by reduction of 15 with reducing agents such as NaBH4, NaCNBH3, or LiBH4 in MeOH at −78° C. to room temperature or at reflux can afford the desired indolines 3. Alternatively, the indolinyl derivatives 3 in the present invention can be synthesized via the reduction of indol-2-ones 18 using reducing agents such as LiAlH4, BH3 (Scheme 4). The indol-2-one intermediates 18 are either commercially available or can be prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art of organic synthesis. For example, sequential alkylation of intermediates 16 followed by reduction of the nitro group in 17 and subsequent intermolecular cyclization can afford the desired indol-2-ones 18. Alternatively, in Scheme 5, the indol-2-one intermediates 18 can be prepared from the reduction of the indol-2,3-diones 19 followed by sequential alkylation. On the other hand, the indol-2-ones 18 can be prepared from the Cl, Br, or I intermediates 20 via either intramolecular Heck reaction in the presence of a palladium catalyst (such as Pd2(dba)3, Pd(OAc)2), a phosphine ligand (such as BINAP, PCy3, P(t-Bu)3), a base (such as NaO-t-Bu), in solvent (such as 1,4-dioxane, toluene) or radical cyclization with Bu3SnH, AIBN in DMF or toluene under normal heating or microwave irradiation. Scheme 6 indicates that the indoline intermediates 3 can also be prepared via alkylation of the nitrile intermediates 21 followed by reductive cyclization of the resulting piperidinyl derivatives 22. The nitrile intermediates 21 can be prepared from displacement either the bromides, or tosylates 23 with nitrile anion. Intermediates 3 can also be obtained from tertiary alcohols 24 reacting with TMSCN in the presence of a Lewis acid (such as ZnI2) (Schmalz, Tetrahedron Letters, 1009 (2002)). The alcohols 24 can be prepared via ortho lithiation of the fluorides 25, then trapping with the ketones 26. Scheme 7 illustrates the synthesis of the amine intermediates 37 in the present invention wherein, R3 is a halogen group, such as Cl, or a trifluoromethyl group. Nitration of the methoxy intermediates 27 followed by reduction of the nitro group in 28 afforded the anilines 29. Diazotization of 29 followed by reduction formed the hydrazines 30. Hydrazone formation of 30 with the aldehydes 31, followed by cyclic imine formation under Fischer indole condition and subsequently reducing the imines, afforded the pivaloyl protected spiropiperidinyl indoline intermediates 32. Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling of 32 with 33 under Buchwald-Hartwig condition or SNAr displacement of 34 with 32 yielded the N-aryl derivatives 35. Reduction of the NO2 group of 35 followed by reduction of the pivaloyl group in 36 to the neopentyl group led to the aniline intermediates 37. Scheme 8 illustrates an efficient transformation of spiropiperidinyl indolines 3 to various aminoheterocycle urea mimics 41. Indolines 3 couple with 1,2-disubstituted benzenes 38 (where Y and Y′ can be halogen) by Buchwald-Hartwig reaction in the presence of Pd2(dba)3, rac-BINAP, and Cs2CO3 in toluene or under other standard C—N cross coupling conditions, such as Ullmann-Goldberg or Chan-Lam reactions, to afford the key bromo intermediates 39. The second Buchwald-Hartwig reaction or C—N cross coupling reaction of 39 with various heteroaryl anilines gives the corresponding aminoheterocycles 40. The protective group then can be removed to give the compounds of the present invention 41. When the protecting group on the phenol is methyl, demethylation can occur with BBr3, BCl3, BBr3.SMe, BCl3.SMe AlCl3, or BCl3/TBAI (tetra-n-butylammonium iodide) at temperatures between −78° C. and refluxing temperature in a solvent such as CH2Cl2. When heating is needed, the reaction can also occur under microwave irradiation to shorten the reaction time. When the protecting group on the phenol is a benzyl group, debenzylation can occur by using hydrogenation (such as Pd/C, H2) or by using AlCl3 in CH2Cl2 in a variety of solvents such as methanol, EtOAc. Scheme 9 describes the preparation of compounds of the present invention from functional intermediates 42. Anilines 1 can be treated with a thiophosgene equivalent in an organic solvent such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane or toluene to produce the corresponding isothiocyanates 42. Thiophosgene equivalents include thiocarbonic O,O-dipyridin-2-yl ester 1,1′-thiocarbonyldi-2,2′-pyridone, carbon disulfide, thiocarbonyl-diimidazole, and thiophosgene. Treatment of thioisocyanate intermediates 42 with acrylhydrazides (when Z═N) or 2-amino-1-ethanones (when Z═CH or CR′) in a solvent such as dichloromethane at temperatures between 0 to 50° C. provides intermediates 43. Treatment of intermediates 43 with an acid such as neat sulfuric acid, or an equivalent reagent, at temperatures between 0 to 20° C. provides compounds 44. The protective group then can be removed following the procedure described in Scheme 8 to give the compounds of the present invention 46. Acylhydrazides are commercially available or can be prepared from carboxylic acids, acyl chlorides or equivalent reagents by methods known to one skilled in the art of synthetic chemistry. Alternately compounds 43 can be prepared by treatment of intermediates 42 with t-butyl carbazate, or an equivalent reagent, in a solvent such as dichloromethane at temperature between 0 to 50° C. Subsequent removal of the t-butoxycarbonyl with an acid such as TFA in a solvent such as dichloromethane provides intermediates 45. Treatment of intermediates 45 with an acyl chloride, or similar suitably activated acylating reagent, in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at temperatures between 0 to 50° C. provides intermediates 43. Scheme 10 describes the preparation of compounds of the present invention from functional intermediates 42. Treatment of intermediates 42 with amidines in a solvent such as dimethylformamide at temperatures between 70 to 120° C. provides intermediates 47. Treatment of intermediates 47 with DEAD (M. Furukawa et al., Synthesis, 1020-1023 (1990)), or an equivalent reagent, in a solvent such as ethanol or acetonitrile at temperatures between 0 to 70° C. provides intermediates 48. Amidines are commercially available or can be prepared by methods known to one skilled in the art of synthetic chemistry (such as described in Anbazhagam, M. et al., Synthesis, 2467-2469 (2003)). The protective group then can be removed following the procedure described in Scheme 8 to give the compounds of the invention 49. Scheme 11 describes the preparation of compounds of the present invention from functionalized intermediates 42. Treatment of ketones or aldehydes with a base such as sodium hydride in a solvent such as dimethylformamide at temperatures between −78 to 20° C. with subsequent addition of isothiocyanates 42 gives intermediates 50. Treatment of 50 with a base such as sodium hydride followed by treatment with an alkylating agent such as methyliodide in a solvent such as THF at temperatures between −78 to 70° C. affords intermediates 51. Treatment of intermediates of 51 with hydroxylamine in a solvent such as dimethylformamide at temperatures between −78 to 70° C. provides intermediates 53. The protective group then can be removed following the procedure described in Scheme 8 to give the compounds of the invention 54. Subsequently, Scheme 12 illustrates that the trifluoromethyl group in 54 can be hydrolyzed in aqueous NaOH in the presence of variety of nucleophiles such as NH—R, SH—R, OH—R, to form esters 55, or nitriles 56 (for a general procedure, see Organic Letters, 13:1804-1807 (2011)).

As used herein, the term “subject” refers to any human or non-human organism that could potentially benefit from treatment with an anti-platelet agent, e.g., a P2Y1 antagonist. Exemplary subjects include human beings of any age with risk factors for platelet associated disorders. Common risk factors include, but are not limited to, age, sex, weight, and family history. As used herein, “treating” or “treatment” cover the treatment of a disease-state in a mammal, particularly in a human, and include: (a) inhibiting the disease-state, i.e., arresting it development; and/or (b) relieving the disease-state, i.e., causing regression of the disease state. As used herein, “prophylaxis” or “prevention” covers the preventive treatment of a subclinical disease-state in a mammal, particularly in a human, aimed at reducing the probability of the occurrence of a clinical disease-state. Patients are selected for preventative therapy based on factors that are known to increase risk of suffering a clinical disease state compared to the general population. “Prophylaxis” therapies can be divided into (a) primary prevention and (b) secondary prevention. Primary prevention is defined as treatment in a subject that has not yet presented with a clinical disease state, whereas secondary prevention is defined as preventing a second occurrence of the same or similar clinical disease state. As used herein, “risk reduction” covers therapies that lower the incidence of development of a clinical disease state. As such, primary and secondary prevention therapies are examples of risk reduction. “Therapeutically effective amount” is intended to include an amount of a compound of the present invention that is effective when administered alone or in combination to inhibit endothelial lipase and/or to prevent or treat the disorders listed herein. When applied to a combination, the term refers to combined amounts of the active ingredients that result in the preventive or therapeutic effect, whether administered in combination, serially, or simultaneously. P2Y1 Assays Binding Assay A A membrane binding assay was used to identify inhibitors of [33P] 2MeS-ADP binding to cloned human P2Y1 receptors. The cDNA clone for human P2Y1 was obtained from Incyte Pharmaceuticals and its sequence confirmed by established techniques (for a compendium of techniques used see Ausubel, F. et al. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, NY, N.Y. (1995)). The essential coding sequences were subcloned into pCDNA 3.1 (Invitrogen) to produce a P2Y1 expression construct. This construct was then transfected into the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK-293 and stable transfectants selected in GENETICIN® (G418 sulfate; Life Technologies). Several lines were screened for binding activity and one (HEK293 #49) selected for further characterization. Membranes were prepared by growing HEK293 #49 in 150 mm dishes in DMEM/10% FBS in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 until cells were 80-90% confluent. Plates were then washed with cold (4° C.) D-PBS twice and cells harvested by scraping into 10 mL D-PBS. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (1,000 g, 10 min, 4° C.) and the resulting pellet resuspended in Lysis Buffer (10 mM Tris (7.4), 5 mM MgCl2 containing Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Cat #1873580) as recommended by the manufacturer). The suspension was then homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer (10-15 strokes; B pestle, on ice) and the homogenate spun at 1,000 g, 4° C., 5 min to pellet large debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 150,000 g, 4° C., for 1 hour and the resulting membrane pellet resuspended in 0.5-1 mL of Buffer B (15 mM HEPES (7.4), 145 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM KCl) and stored at −70° C. until used. Binding reactions were performed in WGA FlashPlates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Cat # SMP105A) in a volume of 200 μL containing ˜45 fmol of P2Y1 receptor (5 μg of total protein), 0.5 nM [33P] 2MeS-ADP (PerkinElmer; 2,000 Ci/mmol), and various concentrations of the test compound (usually between 50 μM and 10 pM) in Buffer B containing 1% DMSO. Reactions were allowed to proceed to completion at room temperature for 1 hour and then the aqueous solution aspirated. Plates were sealed and the residual [33P] bound to the plate determined by scintillation counting. Dose-response curves (IC50) were fit by non-linear regression (XLFit, ID Business Solutions Ltd.) and binding constants (Ki) calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff relationship (Ki=IC50/(1+L/Kd) in which a Kd for 2MeS-ADP to the P2Y1 receptor was determined to be 1.4 nM. Binding Assay B—Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) for P2Y1 Binding A SPA membrane binding assay was used to identify inhibitors of [33P] 2MeS-ADP binding to cloned human P2Y1 receptors (The P2Y1 receptor membranes were provided by Biology and the cloning of the receptor and P2Y1 receptor membrane preparation is same as described by Biology). Binding reactions were performed in 384-well OptiPlates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Cat #6007299) in a volume of 50 μL containing ˜15 fmol of P2Y1 receptor (1.7 μg of total protein), 0.3 nM [33P] 2MeS-ADP (PerkinElmer; 2,000 Ci/mmol), various concentrations of the test compound (usually between 10 μM and 160 pM) in Buffer B containing 1% DMSO in assay buffer (15 mM, HEPES, 145 mM potassium chloride, 5 mM sodium Chloride, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) and 100 μg of SPA bead (WGA polystyrene Image beads, #RPNQ 0260V, Amersham). Reactions were allowed to proceed to completion at room temperature for 1 hour followed by centrifugation of the plate for 5 min. About 40 μL of the aqueous solution was aspirated. Plates were sealed and the [33P] 2MeS-ADP bound to the P2Y1 receptor membranes that were bound to the SPA bead were determined in a Gen 4 LEADSEEKERSM (Amersham) Image Reader. Dose-response curves (IC50) were fit by non-linear regression (Toolset an in house data processing program) and binding constants (Ki) calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff relationship (Ki=IC50/(1+L/Kd) in which a Kd for 2MeS-ADP to the P2Y1 receptor was determined to be 1.4 nM. ADP Induced Platelet Aggregation Assay The ability of P2Y1 antagonists covered in the present invention to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by 10 μM ADP was tested using human platelet rich plasma (PRP) as described in Platelet Protocols: Research and Clinical Laboratory Procedures (White, M. M. et al., Academic Press (1999)). Human blood was collected in 30 μM (final concentration in blood) argatroban (GSK) as the anticoagulant at a ratio of 1 ml per 9 ml of blood. The PRP was isolated by centrifugation at 170 g for 12 minutes. The platelet poor plasma (PPP) was used as the blank for optical aggregometry. Compounds of the present invention in DMSO solution was preincubated with 250 μl PRP at 37° C. for 1 minute with stirring speed of 1000 rpm. Aggregation was initiated by addition of 2.5 μl of 1 mM ADP (Chrono-log, Havertown, Pa.) for a final ADP concentration of 10 uM. Platelet aggregation was monitored using Optical Aggregometer (Chrono-log, Havertown, Pa.) and the area under the curve (AUC) at 5 minute was measured. IC50 was calculated using vehicle control as 0% inhibition. The effectiveness of compounds of the present invention as antithrombotic agents and can be determined using relevant in vivo thrombosis models, including in vivo rat FeCl2-induced carotid artery thrombosis, in vivo rabbit electrically-induced carotid artery thrombosis, and in vivo rabbit arterio-venous shunt thrombosis models. The potential of compounds of the present invention to have an undesirable bleeding liability can be determined using relevant in vivo rat models of cuticle and mesenteric bleeding time or in vivo rabbit cuticle bleeding model. An ideal compound from the present invention will demonstrate strong antithrombotic activity at doses that minimize the bleeding liability. In Vivo FeCl2-Induced Carotid Artery Thrombosis (FeAT) Model The FeAT model described by Schumacher et al. (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 322:1-9 (2007)) can be used in this study. SPRAGUE DAWLEY® rats (350 to 450 g) are anesthetized with Na-pentobarbital (50 mg/kg i.p.) and the trachea is intubated with polyethylene-205 tubing to ensure airway patency. Temperature is maintained with a warming table and heat lamp. A polyethylene-50 catheter is inserted into the left carotid artery to obtain blood samples for measuring ex vivo platelet aggregation responses to ADP and measuring drug concentration. The right carotid artery is exposed and fitted with transit time doppler probe attached to a T206 flowmeter (Transonic Systems Inc., Ithaca, N.Y.). A piece of parafilm “M” (American National Can, Greenwich, Conn.) is inserted under the vessel and, following baseline flow measurements, a 2 mm by 5 mm strip of filter paper saturated with a 50% solution of FeCl2 is placed on top of the artery for 10 min. The carotid artery is dissected free 60 min after filter paper application and opened lengthwise to expose the thrombus, which is removed, blotted dry and weighed on an AE50 balance (Mettler, Toledo, Ind.). Carotid blood flow is monitored continuously on a TA4000 physiologic recorder (Gould, Cleveland, Ohio). Integrated blood flow is determined as an area under the curve and normalized as percent of baseline (0 min) flow over 60 min to provide a measure of average blood flow over the duration of thrombus formation. In Vivo Rabbit Electrically-Induced Carotid Artery Thrombosis (ECAT) Model The rabbit ECAT model, described by Wong et al. (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 295:212-218 (2000)), can be used in this study. Male New Zealand White rabbits are anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg+50 mg/kg/h IM) and xylazine (10 mg/kg+10 mg/kg/h IM). These anesthetics are supplemented as needed. An electromagnetic flow probe is placed on a segment of an isolated carotid artery to monitor blood flow. Test agents or vehicle will be given (i. v., i. p., s. c., or orally) prior to the initiation of thrombosis. Thrombus formation is induced by electrical stimulation of the carotid artery for 3 min at 4 mA using an external stainless-steel bipolar electrode. Carotid blood flow is measured continuously over a 90-min period to monitor thrombus-induced occlusion. Total carotid blood flow over 90 min is calculated by trapezoidal rule. Average carotid flow over 90 min is then determined by converting total carotid blood flow over 90 min to percent of total control carotid blood flow, which would result if control blood flow had been maintained continuously for 90 min. The ED50 (dose that increased average carotid blood flow over 90 min to 50% of the control) of compounds are estimated by a nonlinear least square regression program using the Hill sigmoid E equation (DeltaGraph; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill.). In Vivo Rabbit Arterio-Venous (AV) Shunt Thrombosis Model The rabbit AV shunt model, described by Wong et al. (Wong, P. C. et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 292:351-357 (2000)), can be used in this study. Male New Zealand White rabbits are anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg+50 mg/kg/h IM) and xylazine (10 mg/kg+10 mg/kg/h IM). These anesthetics are supplemented as needed. The femoral artery, jugular vein and femoral vein are isolated and catheterized. A saline-filled AV shunt device is connected between the femoral arterial and the femoral venous cannulae. The AV shunt device consists of an outer piece of tygon tubing (length=8 cm; internal diameter=7.9 mm) and an inner piece of tubing (length=2.5 cm; internal diameter=4.8 mm). The AV shunt also contains an 8-cm-long 2-0 silk thread (Ethicon, Somerville, N.J.). Blood flows from the femoral artery via the AV-shunt into the femoral vein. The exposure of flowing blood to a silk thread induces the formation of a significant thrombus. Forty minutes later, the shunt is disconnected and the silk thread covered with thrombus is weighed. Test agents or vehicle will be given (i. v., i. p., s. c., or orally) prior to the opening of the AV shunt. The percentage inhibition of thrombus formation is determined for each treatment group. The ID50 values (dose which produces 50% inhibition of thrombus formation) are estimated by a nonlinear least square regression program using the Hill sigmoid E equation (DeltaGraph; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill.). In Vivo Rat Cuticle Bleeding Time (CBT) and Mesenteric Bleeding Time (MBT) Model The CBT and MBT models described by Schumacher et al. (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 322:1-9 (2007)) can be used in this study. SPRAGUE DAWLEY® rats (350 to 450 g) are anesthetized with Na-pentobarbital (50 mg/kg i.p.) and the trachea is intubated with polyethylene-205 tubing to ensure airway patency. Temperature is maintained with a warming table and heat lamp. A polyethylene-50 catheter is inserted into the left carotid artery to obtain blood samples for measuring ex vivo platelet aggregation responses to ADP. For the MBT the abdomen is opened via a midline incision and the small intestine is exteriorized. The jejunum is exposed, held in place with clamps and superfused with Ringer's solution maintained at 37° C. Small arteries that branch perpendicular to the mesenteric artery and course over the surface of the jejunum are observed through an SZH10 stereomicroscope (Olympus Corp., Lake Success, N.Y.). These vessels are punctured with a 30-gauge hypodermic needle, and the time in sec from puncturing until bleeding stopped and remained stopped for 30 sec is recorded. The maximum bleeding time recorded is 10 min and 3 to 5 replicate bleed times are determined. For the CBT toenails are cut with a single edged razor blade at the location where the quick meets the nail. The cuticle is immediately superfused with Ringer's solution maintained at 37° C., and the time until bleeding stopped and remained stopped for 30 sec is recorded. The maximum bleeding time recorded is 15 min. Three replicate bleeding times are determined on the hind paw. In Vivo Rabbit Cuticle Bleeding Time Model The rabbit cuticle bleeding time model, described by Wong et al. (Wong, P. C. et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 303:993-1000 (2000)), can be used in this study. Male rabbits were anesthetized with ketamine (50 mg/kg+50 mg/kg/h IM) and xylazine (10 mg/kg+10 mg/kg/h IM). These anesthetics are supplemented as needed, and their hind paws were shaved. A standard cut was made at the apex of the cuticle with a razor blade. Blood was allowed to flow freely by keeping the bleeding site in contact with 37° C. warm Lactated Ringer's solution. Bleeding time was defined as the time after transection when bleeding was ceased. It was measured by averaging the bleeding time of three nail cuticles in the control period and at 60 min of the treatment period. Compound or vehicle was infused i.v. 1 h before the cuticle bleeding and continuously during the bleeding time measurement period. Comparator Compounds The following comparator compounds and their preparations are disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0293281 A1: Comparator No. (Example No. in US 2006/ 0293281 A1) Structure Comparator 1 (Example 19 in US 2006/ 0293281 A1) Comparator 3 (Example 20 in US 2006/ 0293281 A1) Comparator 3 (Example 22 in US 2006/ 0293281 A1) Comparator 4 (Example 23 in US 2006/ 0293281 A1) The following representative in vitro biological data was measured in a binding assay for the Comparator Compound and the exemplified examples herein: TABLE 1 P2Y1 Ki (nM) using PA IC50 (μM) @ Example No. binding assay B 10 μM ADP Comparator 1 258.8* >40 Comparator 2 6.3* >40 Comparator 3 18* >40 Comparator 4 7.9* >>40 1 10 1.0 2 26 0.9 3 16 0.5 4 15 2.2 5 12 1.6 6 11 2.3 7 3.3* 2.7 8 7 1.5 9 24.3* 8.5 10 40.2 11.4 11 16 3.7 12 6.5* 0.9 13 6.6* 0.9 14 155.4* 23.0 15 5.7* 1.6 16 66 17.7 17 48 7.2 18 33 1.8 19 28 10.7 20 16 2.6 21 13 1.3 22 22 4.0 23 19 3.4 24 28 4.5 25 19 3.7 26 13 0.9 27 24 3.2 28 6.8 5.8 29 23 2.4 30 5 2.0 31 6 4.2 32 69 15.6 33 23 9.2 34 37 9.9 35 6 5.4 36 8 2.1 37 60 9.9 38 66 9.0 39 9 4.9 40 19 1.0 41 21 20.3 42 22 22.8 43 8 3.1 44 8 0.8 45 3 3.5 46 10 1.1 *Using binding assay A. The platelet aggregation assay measures the in vitro antiplatelet activity of a compound in platelet rich plasma. The assay is sensitive to plasma protein binding, and is believed to be a better predictor of actual in vivo activity. Surprisingly, it was discovered that the compounds of the present invention are unexpectedly significantly more active in the platelet aggregation assay than those exemplified in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0293281 A1. VI. Pharmaceutical Compositions, Formulations and Combinations The compounds of this invention can be administered for any of the uses described herein by any suitable means, for example, orally, such as tablets, capsules (each of which includes sustained release or timed release formulations), pills, powders, granules, elixirs, tinctures, suspensions, syrups, and emulsions; sublingually; bucally; parenterally, such as by subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, or intrasternal injection, or infusion techniques (e.g., as sterile injectable aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions); nasally, including administration to the nasal membranes, such as by inhalation spray; topically, such as in the form of a cream or ointment; or rectally such as in the form of suppositories. They can be administered alone, but generally will be administered with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis of the chosen route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. The term “pharmaceutical composition” means a composition comprising a compound of the invention in combination with at least one additional pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. A “pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” refers to media generally accepted in the art for the delivery of biologically active agents to animals, in particular, mammals, including, i.e., adjuvant, excipient or vehicle, such as diluents, preserving agents, fillers, flow regulating agents, disintegrating agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, suspending agents, sweetening agents, flavoring agents, perfuming agents, anti-bacterial agents, anti-fungal agents, lubricating agents and dispensing agents, depending on the nature of the mode of administration and dosage forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are formulated according to a number of factors well within the purview of those of ordinary skill in the art. These include, without limitation: the type and nature of the active agent being formulated; the subject to which the agent-containing composition is to be administered; the intended route of administration of the composition; and the therapeutic indication being targeted. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include both aqueous and non-aqueous liquid media, as well as a variety of solid and semi-solid dosage forms. Such carriers can include a number of different ingredients and additives in addition to the active agent, such additional ingredients being included in the formulation for a variety of reasons, e.g., stabilization of the active agent, binders, etc., well known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Descriptions of suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, and factors involved in their selection, are found in a variety of readily available sources such as, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Edition (1990). The dosage regimen for the compounds of the present invention will, of course, vary depending upon known factors, such as the pharmacodynamic characteristics of the particular agent and its mode and route of administration; the species, age, sex, health, medical condition, and weight of the recipient; the nature and extent of the symptoms; the kind of concurrent treatment; the frequency of treatment; the route of administration, the renal and hepatic function of the patient, and the effect desired. By way of general guidance, the daily oral dosage of each active ingredient, when used for the indicated effects, will range between about 0.01 to about 5000 mg per day, preferably between about 0.1 to about 1000 mg per day, and most preferably between about 0.1 to about 250 mg per day. Intravenously, the most preferred doses will range from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/kg/minute during a constant rate infusion. Compounds of this invention may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three, or four times daily. The compounds are typically administered in admixture with suitable pharmaceutical diluents, excipients, or carriers (collectively referred to herein as pharmaceutical carriers) suitably selected with respect to the intended form of administration, e.g., oral tablets, capsules, elixirs, and syrups, and consistent with conventional pharmaceutical practices. Dosage forms (pharmaceutical compositions) suitable for administration may contain from about 1 milligram to about 2000 milligrams of active ingredient per dosage unit. In these pharmaceutical compositions the active ingredient will ordinarily be present in an amount of about 0.1-95% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. A typical capsule for oral administration contains at least one of the compounds of the present invention (250 mg), lactose (75 mg), and magnesium stearate (15 mg). The mixture is passed through a 60 mesh sieve and packed into a No. 1 gelatin capsule. A typical injectable preparation is produced by aseptically placing at least one of the compounds of the present invention (250 mg) into a vial, aseptically freeze-drying and sealing. For use, the contents of the vial are mixed with 2 mL of physiological saline, to produce an injectable preparation. The present invention includes within its scope pharmaceutical compositions comprising, as an active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of at least one of the compounds of the present invention, alone or in combination with a pharmaceutical carrier. Optionally, compounds of the present invention can be used alone, in combination with other compounds of the invention, or in combination with one or more, preferably one to three, other therapeutic agent(s), e.g., other anti-platelet agents or other pharmaceutically active material. Additionally, the present compounds may be used in combination with one or more of various other therapeutic agents, including: anti-arrhythmic agents; anti-hypertensive agents; anti-thrombotic and/or anti-thrombolytic agents; calcium channel blockers (L-type and T-type); cardiac glycosides; diuretics, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists; phospodiesterase inhibitors; cholesterol/lipid lowering agents and lipid profile therapies; anti-diabetic agents; anti-depressants; anti-inflammatory agents (steroidal and non-steroidal); antiosteoporosis agents; hormone replacement therapies; oral contraceptives; anticoagulants; anti-obesity agents; anti-anxiety agents; anti-proliferative agents; anti-tumor agents; anti-ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease agents; growth hormone and/or growth hormone secretagogues; thyroid mimetics (including thyroid receptor antagonist); anti-infective agents; anti-viral agents; anti-bacterial agents; and anti-fungal agents. The above other therapeutic agents, when employed in combination with the compounds of the present invention may be used, for example, in those amounts indicated in the Physicians' Desk Reference, as in the patents set out above, or as otherwise determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. Particularly when provided as a single dosage unit, the potential exists for a chemical interaction between the combined active ingredients. For this reason, when the compound of the present invention and a second therapeutic agent are combined in a single dosage unit they are formulated such that although the active ingredients are combined in a single dosage unit, the physical contact between the active ingredients is minimized (that is, reduced). For example, one active ingredient may be enteric coated. By enteric coating one of the active ingredients, it is possible not only to minimize the contact between the combined active ingredients, but also, it is possible to control the release of one of these components in the gastrointestinal tract such that one of these components is not released in the stomach but rather is released in the intestines. One of the active ingredients may also be coated with a material that affects a sustained-release throughout the gastrointestinal tract and also serves to minimize physical contact between the combined active ingredients. Furthermore, the sustained-released component can be additionally enteric coated such that the release of this component occurs only in the intestine. Still another approach would involve the formulation of a combination product in which the one component is coated with a sustained and/or enteric release polymer, and the other component is also coated with a polymer such as a low viscosity grade of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) or other appropriate materials as known in the art, in order to further separate the active components. The polymer coating serves to form an additional barrier to interaction with the other component. These as well as other ways of minimizing contact between the components of combination products of the present invention, whether administered in a single dosage form or administered in separate forms but at the same time by the same manner, will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, once armed with the present disclosure. The compounds of the present invention can be administered alone or in combination with one or more, preferably one to three, additional therapeutic agents. By “administered in combination” or “combination therapy” it is meant that the compound of the present invention and one or more, preferably one to three, additional therapeutic agents are administered concurrently to the mammal being treated. When administered in combination, each component may be administered at the same time or sequentially in any order at different points in time. Thus, each component may be administered separately but sufficiently closely in time so as to provide the desired therapeutic effect. The compounds of the present invention are also useful as standard or reference compounds, for example as a quality standard or control, in tests or assays involving the endothelial lipase. Such compounds may be provided in a commercial kit, for example, for use in pharmaceutical research involving P2Y1 or anti-platelet activity. For example, a compound of the present invention could be used as a reference in an assay to compare its known activity to a compound with an unknown activity. This would ensure the experimenter that the assay was being performed properly and provide a basis for comparison, especially if the test compound was a derivative of the reference compound. When developing new assays or protocols, compounds according to the present invention could be used to test their effectiveness. Other features of the invention should become apparent in the course of the above descriptions of exemplary embodiments that are given for illustration of the invention and are not intended to be limiting thereof. EXAMPLES The following Examples have been prepared, isolated and characterized using the methods disclosed herein. The following examples demonstrate a partial scope of the invention and are not meant to be limiting of the scope of the invention.

Intermediate 1 1-Pivaloylpiperidine-4-carbaldehyde A 1000-mL oven-dried flask capped with a rubber septum was evacuated and backfilled with argon. The flask was charged with oxalyl chloride (17.4 mL, 203 mmol) in 320 mL of DCM. At −78° C., a solution of DMSO (28.9 mL, 406 mmol) in 50 mL DCM was added dropwise. After 30 min, Intermediate 1A (27.0 g, 135 mmol) in 100 mL of DCM was added dropwise. After 30 min, triethylamine (75.5 mL, 542 mmol) was added, stirred for 30 min at −78° C. The reaction was poured into water, extracted with DCM (3×). Combined organic layers were washed with water (3×300 mL), dried over Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo providing 24.2 g (yield: 91%) of Intermediate 1. 1H-NMR (DMSO-d6) δ ppm 9.58 (s, 1H), 4.25 (d, J=10.36 Hz, 1H), 4.06 (ddd, J=13.52, 3.66, 3.54 Hz, 2H), 2.93-3.04 (m, 1H), 2.65-2.76 (m, 1H), 1.78-1.86 (m, 1H), 1.65 (d, J=12.38 Hz, 1H), 1.30-1.41 (m, 2H), 1.16 (s, 9H); LCMS (ESI) m/z 198 (M+H)+, RT=0.518 min (Method B).
