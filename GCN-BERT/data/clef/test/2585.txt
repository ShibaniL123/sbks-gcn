Preparation of a diastereoisomeric mixture of 6-((6S,8R)-7-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-N-(1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)pyridin-3-amine
1-(3-Fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-amine (0.115 g, 0.87 mmol), (6S,8R)-6-(5-bromopyridin-2-yl)-7-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinoline (0.330 g, 0.43 mmol), dicyclohexyl(2',4',6'-triisopropyl-3,6-dimethoxy-[1,1'-biphenyl]-2-yl)phosphane (0.023 g, 0.04 mmol) and sodium tert-butoxide (0.125 g, 1.30 mmol) were suspended in 1,4-dioxane (4 mL). The mixture was degassed and [(2-di-cyclohexylphosphino-3,6-dimethoxy-2',4',6'-triisopropyl-1,1'-biphenyl)-2-(2'-amino-1,1'-biphenyl)]palladium(II) methanesulfonate methanesulfonate (BrettPhos G3) (0.039 g, 0.04 mmol) was added. The reaction was heated to 100° C. for 3 hours. The reaction mixture was diluted with DCM (50 mL) and washed with water (50 mL). The organic layer was evaporated and the crude product was purified by flash silica chromatography, elution gradient 0 to 20% MeOH in DCM to afford 6-((6S,8R)-7-(3-((tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy)-2,2-difluoropropyl)-8-methyl-3-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-f]isoquinolin-6-yl)-N-(1-(3-fluoropropyl)azetidin-3-yl)pyridin-3-amine (0.264 g, 75%) as a yellow gum as a mixture of diastereoisomers. 19F NMR (471 MHz, DMSO, 27° C.) −218.19, −110.13, −109.44, −108.6-107.8; m/z: ES+ [M+H]+ 811.
