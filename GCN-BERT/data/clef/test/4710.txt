Step 2
(5-Ethyl-isoxazol-3-yl) methanol
Methyl 5-ethylisoxazole-3-carboxylate (100 mg, 0.645 mmol) was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (5 mL), and lithium aluminum hydride (36.7 mg, 0.967 mmol) was added in batches at 0°C, followed by stirring under nitrogen atmosphere for 1 hour. The reaction solution was cooled to 0°C, followed by slowly adding water (0.04 mL), 15% sodium hydroxide (0.04 mL) and water (0.12 mL) successively, and then filtered. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to give the product (5-ethyl-isoxazol-3-yl) methanol (70.0 mg, as a yellow oil) with a yield of 85%.
