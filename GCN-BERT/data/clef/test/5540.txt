4-({[3-Methyl-2-phenyl-6-(trifluoromethoxy)quinolin-4-yl]carbonyl}amino)bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylic acid
70.4 mg (0.14 mmol) of the compound from Example 60A were dissolved in 2.5 ml of a THF/methanol mixture (5:1), 0.69 ml (0.69 mmol) of a 1 M lithium hydroxide solution was added and the mixture was stirred at 60Â° C. for 3 h. After cooling to RT, the mixture was adjusted to pH 1-2 by addition of 4 M hydrochloric acid and purified by preparative HPLC (Method 2). This gave 43 mg (62% of theory, purity 99%) of the title compound
