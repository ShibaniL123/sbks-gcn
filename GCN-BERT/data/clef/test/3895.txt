Detailed Description of the Invention The terms "ameliorate" and "treat" are used interchangeably and include both therapeutic and prophylactic treatment. Both terms mean decrease, suppress, attenuate, diminish, arrest, or stabilize the development or progression of a disease (e.g., a disease or disorder delineated herein). "Disease" means any condition or disorder that damages or interferes with the normal function of a cell, tissue, or organ. It will be recognized that some variation of natural isotopic abundance occurs in a synthesized compound depending upon the origin of chemical materials used in the synthesis. Thus, a preparation of anacetrapib will inherently contain small amounts of deuterated isotopologues. The concentration of naturally abundant stable hydrogen and carbon isotopes, notwithstanding this variation, is small and immaterial as compared to the degree of stable isotopic substitution of compounds of this invention. See, for instance, Wada, E. et al., Seikagaku 1994, 66:15; Ganes, L.Z. et al., Comp. Biochem. Physiol. Mol. Integr. Physiol. 1998, 119:725. In a compound of this invention, when a particular position is designated as having deuterium, it is understood that the abundance of deuterium at that position is substantially greater than the natural abundance of deuterium, which is 0.015%. A position designated as having deuterium has a minimum isotopic enrichment factor of at least about 3000 (45% deuterium incorporation) at each atom designated as deuterium in said compound. The term "isotopic enrichment factor" as used herein means the ratio between the isotopic abundance and the natural abundance of a specified isotope. In other embodiments, a compound of this invention has an isotopic enrichment factor for each designated deuterium atom of at least about 3500 (52.5% deuterium incorporation at each designated deuterium atom), at least about 4000 (60% deuterium incorporation), at least about 4500 (67.5% deuterium incorporation), at least about 5000 (75% deuterium incorporation), at least about 5500 (82.5% deuterium incorporation), at least about 6000 (90% deuterium incorporation), at least about 6333.3 (95% deuterium incorporation), at least about 6466.7 (97% deuterium incorporation), at least about 6600 (99% deuterium incorporation), or at least about 6633.3 (99.5% deuterium incorporation). In the compounds of this invention any atom not specifically designated as a particular isotope is meant to represent any stable isotope of that atom. Unless otherwise stated, when a position is designated specifically as "H" or "hydrogen," the position is understood to have hydrogen at its natural abundance isotopic composition. The term "isotopologue" refers to a species that differs from a specific compound of this invention only in the isotopic composition thereof. The term "compound," as used herein, is also intended to include any salts, solvates or hydrates thereof. A salt of a compound of this invention is formed between an acid and a basic group of the compound, such as an amino functional group, or a base and an acidic group of the compound, such as a carboxyl functional group. According to another embodiment, the compound is a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable," as used herein, refers to a component that is, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and other mammals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. A "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means any non-toxic salt that, upon administration to a recipient, is capable of providing, either directly or indirectly, a compound of this invention. A "pharmaceutically acceptable counterion" is an ionic portion of a salt that is not toxic when released from the salt upon administration to a recipient. Acids commonly employed to form pharmaceutically acceptable salts include inorganic acids such as hydrogen bisulfide, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid and phosphoric acid, as well as organic acids such as para-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, tartaric acid, bitartaric acid, ascorbic acid, maleic acid, besylic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, glucuronic acid, formic acid, glutamic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, lactic acid, oxalic acid, para-bromophenylsulfonic acid, carbonic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, benzoic acid and acetic acid, as well as related inorganic and organic acids. Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus include sulfate, pyrosulfate, bisulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, chloride, bromide, iodide, acetate, propionate, decanoate, caprylate, acrylate, formate, isobutyrate, caprate, heptanoate, propiolate, oxalate, malonate, succinate, suberate, sebacate, fumarate, maleate, butyne-1,4-dioate, hexyne-1,6-dioate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, methylbenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, phthalate, terephathalate, sulfonate, xylene sulfonate, phenylacetate, phenylpropionate, phenylbutyrate, citrate, lactate, β-hydroxybutyrate, glycolate, maleate, tartrate, methanesulfonate, propanesulfonate, naphthalene-1-sulfonate, naphthalene-2- sulfonate, mandelate and other salts. In one embodiment, pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include those formed with mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid and hydrobromic acid, and especially those formed with organic acids such as maleic acid. As used herein, the term "hydrate" means a compound which further includes a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of water bound by non-covalent intermolecular forces. As used herein, the term "solvate" means a compound which further includes a stoichiometric or non-stoichiometric amount of solvent such as water, acetone, ethanol, methanol, dichloromethane, 2-propanol, or the like, bound by non-covalent intermolecular forces. The compounds of the present invention (e.g., compounds of Formula I or II), may contain an asymmetric carbon atom, for example, as the result of deuterium substitution or otherwise. As such, compounds of this invention can exist as either individual enantiomers, or mixtures of the two enantiomers. Accordingly, a compound of the present invention will include both racemic mixtures, and also individual respective stereoisomers that are substantially free from another possible stereoisomer. The term "substantially free of other stereoisomers" as used herein means less than 25% of other stereoisomers, preferably less than 10% of other stereoisomers, more preferably less than 5% of other stereoisomers and most preferably less than 2% of other stereoisomers, or less than 1% of other stereoisomers are present. Methods of obtaining or synthesizing an individual enantiomer for a given compound are well known in the art and may be applied as practicable to final compounds or to starting material or intermediates. The term "stable compounds," as used herein, refers to compounds which possess stability sufficient to allow for their manufacture and which maintain the integrity of the compound for a sufficient period of time to be useful for the purposes detailed herein (e.g., formulation into therapeutic products, intermediates for use in production of therapeutic compounds, isolatable or storable intermediate compounds, treating a disease or condition responsive to therapeutic agents). Both "2H" and "D" refer to deuterium. "Stereoisomer" refers to both enantiomers and diastereomers. Throughout this specification, a variable may be referred to generally (e.g., "each R") or may be referred to specifically (e.g., R1, R2, R3, etc.). Unless otherwise indicated, when a variable is referred to generally, it is meant to include all specific embodiments of that particular variable.

In a more specific embodiment, the compound of this invention is selected from: and In another set of embodiments, any atom not designated as deuterium in any of the embodiments set forth above is present at its natural isotopic abundance. The synthesis of compounds of Formulae I and II can be readily achieved by synthetic chemists of ordinary skill. Relevant procedures and intermediates are disclosed, for instance in U.S. Patent Application 2006/0040999 and in PCT publication WO2007/005572. Such methods can be carried out utilizing corresponding deuterated and optionally, other isotope-containing reagents and/or intermediates to synthesize the compounds delineated herein, or invoking standard synthetic protocols known in the art for introducing isotopic atoms to a chemical structure. Exemplary Synthesis A convenient method for synthesizing compounds of Formula I or II is depicted in Scheme 1. An appropriately deuterated 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanone 10 is reduced to the corresponding alcohol 11 using an appropriately deuterated methyl magnesium chloride and CeCl3. The alcohol 11 is hydrogenated to the anisole 12 over a palladium/carbon catalyst in the presence of hydrogen or deuterium gas. The anisole 12 is then brominated with NBS to produce aryl bromide 13, which is then converted to boronic acid intermediate 14 by treatment with tri-isopropylborate. The boronic acid 14 is then coupled with an appropriately deuterated (2-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)methanol 15 using a Suzuki coupling reaction to produce biaryl intermediate 16. The biaryl intermediate is chlorinated with thionyl chloride to produce intermediate 17. Intermediate 17 is then alkylated with oxazolidinone reagent 18 to yield a compound of Formula I or II. The synthesis of oxazolidinone reagent 18 is shown in Scheme 2. The Weinreb amide 20 is synthesized from commercially available CBZ-L-alanine or CBZ-L-glycine (the enantiomer of 20 is obtained by using commercially available CBZ-D-alanine or CBZ-D-glycine), HOBT-hydrate and Weinreb amine HCl salt as described in PCT publication WO2007005572. The amide 20 is combined with 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)bromobenzene 21 to produce ketone 22, which is then reduced to the chiral oxazolidinone reagent 18 using Al(O-i-Pr)3, as described in PCT publication WO2007005572. Incorporation of deuterium for Y4 can be accomplished by performing the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Verley reaction using deuterated reagents as disclosed by Williams, ED et al, JACS 1953, 75:2404-2407. An appropriately deuterated 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanone 10 is produced according to Scheme 3. 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanone 23 or 1-(2-fluoro-4-hydroxyphenyl)ethanone 23 is deuteromethylated by reaction with d6-dimethyl sulfate and potassium carbonate in acetone to produce the corresponding 1-(4-d3-methoxyphenyl)ethanone 10-d3, which may be further deuterated with D2O in base to form the corresponding 1-(4-d3-methoxyphenyl)-d3-ethanone 10-d6. An appropriately deuterated (2-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)methanol 15 can be produced from the corresponding acid 30 by one of Schemes 4A or 4B. In Scheme 4A, 2-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid 30 is reduced with lithium aluminum deuteride in ether or BD3-THF to produce (2-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-d2-methanol 11 using the procedure disclosed in Angew Chemie Intl Ed 2007, 46(10):1719-1722; or Bioorg Med Chem 2006, 14(22):7625-7651. In Scheme 4B, 2-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)benzoic acid 30 is treated with sulfonyl chloride in toluene, followed by reduction with sodium borodeuteride in THF and DMF to produce (2-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-d2-methanol 11 using the procedure disclosed in Org Lett 2007, 9(14):2649-2651. In Scheme 5, a synthetic route to deuterated analogs of compound 20 is shown. Commercially available deuterated analogs of L-Alanine (40) are reacted with benzyl chloroformate under Shotten-Bauman conditions to provide 41 as described by Aitken, RA et al, J Chem Soc Perk Trans 2002, 1:533-541. The acid can then be converted to the deuterated analogs of Weinreb Amide 20 as described by Kano, S et al, Chem Pharm Bull 1988, 36(9):3296-3303. In Scheme 6, a synthetic route to deuterated analogs of compound 21 is shown. Commercially available d5-trifluoromethylbenzene (50) can be regioselectively iodinated to provide 51 in high yields according to the method of Chambers, RD et al, J Chem Soc Chem Comm 1995, 1:19. The iodine substituent can be readily converted to the trifluoromethyl 52 according to the procedure of MacNeil, JG et al, J Fluorine Chem 1991, 55(2):225-227. The deuterated analog of 21 can be obtained by selective bromination according to the method of Leazer, JL et al, J Org Chem 2003, 68(9): 3695-3698. The specific approaches and compounds shown above are not intended to be limiting. The chemical structures in the schemes herein depict variables that are hereby defined commensurately with chemical group definitions (moieties, atoms, etc.) of the corresponding position in the compound formulae herein, whether identified by the same variable name (i.e., R1, R2, R3, etc.) or not. The suitability of a chemical group in a compound structure for use in the synthesis of another compound is within the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art. Additional methods of synthesizing compounds of Formula I and their synthetic precursors, including those within routes not explicitly shown in schemes herein, are within the means of chemists of ordinary skill in the art. Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group methodologies (protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing the applicable compounds are known in the art and include, for example, those described in Larock R, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers (1989); Greene TW et al., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd Ed., John Wiley and Sons (1999); Fieser L et al., Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons (1994); and Paquette L, ed., Encyclopedia ofReagents for Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons (1995) and subsequent editions thereof. Combinations of substituents and variables envisioned by this invention are those that result in the formation of stable compounds. Compounds of formula I are inhibitors of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), a plasma protein that facilitates the transfer of cholesterol ester from high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to low density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Various methods are known in the art for confirming activity of CETP inhibitors, and assay kits for determination of CETP activity and inhibition, in vitro or ex vivo, are commercially available. For example, the CETP Inhibitor Drug Screening Kit (BioVision Research Products, Mountain View, CA) can be used to assay inhibitors directly. An assay for measuring CETP inhibition in plasma is available from Roar Biomedical, Inc. (New York, NY). Compositions The invention also provides pyrogen-free compositions comprising an effective amount of a compound of Formula I or II (e.g., including any of the formulae herein), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, solvate, or hydrate of said compound; and an acceptable carrier. Preferably, a composition of this invention is formulated for pharmaceutical use ("a pharmaceutical composition"), wherein the carrier is a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The carrier(s) are "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and, in the case of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, not deleterious to the recipient thereof in an amount used in the medicament. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles that may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin, serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine, sorbic acid, potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids, water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, cellulose-based substances, polyethylene glycol, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-block polymers, polyethylene glycol and wool fat. If required, the solubility and bioavailability of the compounds of the present invention in pharmaceutical compositions may be enhanced by methods well-known in the art. One method includes the use of lipid excipients in the formulation. See "Oral Lipid-Based Formulations: Enhancing the Bioavailability of Poorly Water-Soluble Drugs (Drugs and the Pharmaceutical Sciences)," David J. Hauss, ed. Informa Healthcare, 2007; and "Role of Lipid Excipients in Modifying Oral and Parenteral Drug Delivery: Basic Principles and Biological Examples," Kishor M. Wasan, ed. Wiley-Interscience, 2006. Another known method of enhancing bioavailability is the use of an amorphous form of a compound of this invention optionally formulated with a poloxamer, such as LUTROL™ and PLURONIC™ (BASF Corporation), or block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide. See United States Patent 7,014,866; and United States patent publications 2006/0094744 and 2006/0079502. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including buccal and sublingual), vaginal or parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous and intradermal) administration. In certain embodiments, the compound of the formulae herein is administered transdermally (e.g., using a transdermal patch or iontophoretic techniques). Other formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., tablets, sustained release capsules, and in liposomes, and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. See, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Philadelphia, PA (17th ed. 1985). Such preparative methods include the step of bringing into association with the molecule to be administered ingredients such as the carrier that constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredients with liquid carriers, liposomes or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. In certain embodiments, the compound is administered orally. Compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules, sachets, or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; a powder or granules; a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; an oil-in-water liquid emulsion; a water-in-oil liquid emulsion; packed in liposomes; or as a bolus, etc. Soft gelatin capsules can be useful for containing such suspensions, which may beneficially increase the rate of compound absorption. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers that are commonly used include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried cornstarch. When aqueous suspensions are administered orally, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and/or flavoring and/or coloring agents may be added. Compositions suitable for oral administration include lozenges comprising the ingredients in a flavored basis, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in an inert basis such as gelatin and glycerin, or sucrose and acacia. Compositions suitable for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example, sealed ampules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example water for injections, immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets. Such injection solutions may be in the form, for example, of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents (such as, for example, Tween 80) and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are mannitol, water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration. These compositions can be prepared by mixing a compound of this invention with a suitable non-irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature but liquid at the rectal temperature and therefore will melt in the rectum to release the active components. Such materials include, but are not limited to, cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art. See, e.g.: Rabinowitz JD and Zaffaroni AC, US Patent 6,803,031, assigned to Alexza Molecular Delivery Corporation. Topical administration of the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention is especially useful when the desired treatment involves areas or organs readily accessible by topical application. For topical application topically to the skin, the pharmaceutical composition should be formulated with a suitable ointment containing the active components suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Carriers for topical administration of the compounds of this invention include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid petroleum, white petroleum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax, and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical composition can be formulated with a suitable lotion or cream containing the active compound suspended or dissolved in a carrier. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol, and water. The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be topically applied to the lower intestinal tract by rectal suppository formulation or in a suitable enema formulation. Topically-transdermal patches and iontophoretic administration are also included in this invention. Application of the subject therapeutics may be local, so as to be administered at the site of interest. Various techniques can be used for providing the subject compositions at the site of interest, such as injection, use of catheters, trocars, projectiles, pluronic gel, stents, sustained drug release polymers or other device which provides for internal access. Thus, according to yet another embodiment, the compounds of this invention may be incorporated into compositions for coating an implantable medical device, such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents, or catheters. Suitable coatings and the general preparation of coated implantable devices are known in the art and are exemplified in U.S. Patents 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and 5,304,121. The coatings are typically biocompatible polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer, polymethyldisiloxane, polycaprolactone, polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and mixtures thereof. The coatings may optionally be further covered by a suitable topcoat of fluorosilicone, polysaccharides, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or combinations thereof to impart controlled release characteristics in the composition. Coatings for invasive devices are to be included within the definition of pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or vehicle, as those terms are used herein. According to another embodiment, the invention provides a method of coating an implantable medical device comprising the step of contacting said device with the coating composition described above. It will be obvious to those skilled in the art that the coating of the device will occur prior to implantation into a mammal. According to another embodiment, the invention provides a method of impregnating an implantable drug release device comprising the step of contacting said drug release device with a compound or composition of this invention. Implantable drug release devices include, but are not limited to, biodegradable polymer capsules or bullets, nondegradable, diffusible polymer capsules and biodegradable polymer wafers. According to another embodiment, the invention provides an implantable medical device coated with a compound or a composition comprising a compound of this invention, such that said compound is therapeutically active. According to another embodiment, the invention provides an implantable drug release device impregnated with or containing a compound or a composition comprising a compound of this invention, such that said compound is released from said device and is therapeutically active. Where an organ or tissue is accessible because of removal from the patient, such organ or tissue may be bathed in a medium containing a composition of this invention, a composition of this invention may be painted onto the organ, or a composition of this invention may be applied in any other convenient way. In another embodiment, a composition of this invention further comprises a second therapeutic agent. The second therapeutic agent may be selected from any compound or therapeutic agent known to have or that demonstrates advantageous properties when administered with a compound having the same mechanism of action as anacetrapib. Such agents include those indicated as being useful in combination with anacetrapib, including but not limited to, those described in U.S. Patent No. 6,197,786; and U.S. Patent Applications 2006/0270675; 2007/0004774; 2006/0178514; and 2006/0040999. Preferably, the second therapeutic agent is an agent useful in the treatment of a patient suffering from or susceptible to a disease or condition selected from arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, dyslipidemia and conditions commonly comorbid with these disease states, including but not limited to, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and angina. Agents for use in such compositions include an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, including but not limited to lovastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, fluindostatin, venostatin, dihydrocompactin, compactin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, glenvastatin, dalvastatin, cerivastatin, crilvastatin, bervastatin, cerivastatin, rosuvastatin, pitavastatin, mevastatin, or rivastatin. Other agents for combination therapy include antihypertensive agents, including calcium channel blockers (including but not limited to felodipine, nifedipine or amlodipine), angiotensin A-II antagonists (including but not limited to losartan, irbesartan, telmisartan or valsartan), angiotensin converting inhibitors (including but not limited to benazepril, captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, perindopril, quinapril, trandolapril, ramipril, zestril, zofenopril, cilazapril, temocapril, spirapril, moexipril, delapril, imidapril, ramipril, terazosin, urapidil, indoramin, amosulalol, and alfuzosin), alpha-adrenergic blockers, (including but not limited to doxazosin, prazosin and trimazosin), beta-adrenergic blockers (including but not limited to carvedilol), diuretics (including but not limited to amiloride, bendroflumethiazide, and hydrochlorothiazide), cannabinoid CB1 antagonists including but not limited to rimonabant), and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrates, solvates, and/or polymorphs of the foregoing. Combinations, compositions, and methods of use relevant to compounds of this invention are described in a number of patents and patent applications including, but not limited to, U.S. Patent No. 6,197,786; and U.S. Patent Applications 2006/0270675; 2007/0004774; 2006/0178514; and 2006/0040999. Each of the patents, patent applications, and publications, whether in traditional journals or available only through the internet, referred to herein, is incorporated in its entirety by reference. In one embodiment, the second therapeutic agent is atorvastatin. In another embodiment, the invention provides separate dosage forms of a compound of this invention and one or more of any of the above-described second therapeutic agents, wherein the compound and second therapeutic agent are associated with one another. The term "associated with one another" as used herein means that the separate dosage forms are packaged together or otherwise attached to one another such that it is readily apparent that the separate dosage forms are intended to be sold and administered together (within less than 24 hours of one another, consecutively or simultaneously). In the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, the compound of the present invention is present in an effective amount. As used herein, the term "effective amount" refers to an amount which, when administered in a proper dosing regimen, is sufficient to reduce or ameliorate the severity, duration or progression of the disorder being treated, prevent the advancement of the disorder being treated, cause the regression of the disorder being treated, or enhance or improve the prophylactic or therapeutic effect(s) of another therapy. The interrelationship of dosages for animals and humans (based on milligrams per meter squared of body surface) is described in Freireich et al., (1966) Cancer Chemother. Rep 50: 219. Body surface area may be approximately determined from height and weight of the patient. See, e.g., Scientific Tables, Geigy Pharmaceuticals, Ardsley, N.Y., 1970, 537. In one embodiment, an effective amount of a compound of this invention can range from 0.1 mg to 3000 mg/day. In another embodiment, an effective amount of a compound of this invention can range from 1 mg to 300 mg/day. In still another embodiment, an effective amount of a compound of this invention can range from 10 mg to 300 mg/day. Effective doses will also vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on the diseases treated, the severity of the disease, the route of administration, the sex, age and general health condition of the patient, excipient usage, the possibility of cousage with other therapeutic treatments such as use of other agents and the judgment of the treating physician. For example, guidance for selecting an effective dose can be determined by reference to the prescribing information for anacetrapib. For pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a second therapeutic agent, an effective amount of the second therapeutic agent is between about 20% and 100% of the dosage normally utilized in a monotherapy regime using just that agent. Preferably, an effective amount is between about 70% and 100% of the normal monotherapeutic dose. The normal monotherapeutic dosages of these second therapeutic agents are well known in the art. See, e.g., Wells et al., eds., Pharmacotherapy Handbook, 2nd Edition, Appleton and Lange, Stamford, Conn. (2000); PDR Pharmacopoeia, Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2000, Deluxe Edition, Tarascon Publishing, Loma Linda, Calif. (2000), each of which references are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. It is expected that combinations with second therapeutic agents referenced above will provide improved therapeutic responses. For example, cholesterol levels can be reduced relative to a monotherapy. When this occurs, it will allow the effective dosage of the second therapeutic agent and/or the compound of this invention to be reduced from that required in a monotherapy. This has the advantage of minimizing toxic side effects of either the second therapeutic agent of a compound of this invention, additive or synergistic improvements in efficacy, improved ease of administration or use and/or reduced overall expense of compound preparation or formulation. Methods of Treatment In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of modulating the activity of cholesterol ester transfer protein in a cell, comprising contacting a cell with one or more compounds of Formula I or II herein. According to another embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating a patient suffering from, or susceptible to, a disease that is beneficially treated by anacetrapib comprising the step of administering to said patient an effective amount of a compound or a composition of this invention. Such diseases are well known in the art and include, but are not limited to, high cholesterol, arteriosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and angina. See, e.g., U.S. patent publications 2006/0270675; 2007/0004774; 2006/0178514; and 2006/0040999. In one particular embodiment, the method of this invention is used to treat a patient suffering from or susceptible to dyslipidemia (hypercholesterolemia and mixed hyperlipidemia). Methods delineated herein also include those wherein the patient is identified as in need of a particular stated treatment. Identifying a patient in need of such treatment can be in the judgment of a patient or a health care professional and can be subjective (e.g. opinion) or objective (e.g. measurable by a test or diagnostic method). In another embodiment, any of the above methods of treatment comprises the further step of co-administering to said patient one or more second therapeutic agents. The choice of second therapeutic agent may be made from any second therapeutic agent known to be useful for co-administration with anacetrapib. The choice of second therapeutic agent is also dependent upon the particular disease or condition to be treated. Examples of second therapeutic agents that may be employed in the methods of this invention are those set forth above for use in combination compositions comprising a compound of this invention and a second therapeutic agent. In particular, the combination therapies of this invention include co-administering a compound of Formula I or II and atorvastatin for treatment of dyslipidemia. The term "co-administered" as used herein means that the second therapeutic agent may be administered together with a compound of this invention as part of a single dosage form (such as a composition of this invention comprising a compound of the invention and an second therapeutic agent as described above) or as separate, multiple dosage forms. Alternatively, the additional agent may be administered prior to, consecutively with, or following the administration of a compound of this invention. In such combination therapy treatment, both the compounds of this invention and the second therapeutic agent(s) are administered by conventional methods. The administration of a composition of this invention, comprising both a compound of the invention and a second therapeutic agent, to a patient does not preclude the separate administration of that same therapeutic agent, any other second therapeutic agent or any compound of this invention to said patient at another time during a course of treatment. Effective amounts of these second therapeutic agents are well known to those skilled in the art and guidance for dosing may be found in patents and published patent applications referenced herein, as well as in Wells et al., eds., Pharmacotherapy Handbook, 2nd Edition, Appleton and Lange, Stamford, Conn. (2000); PDR Pharmacopoeia, Tarascon Pocket Pharmacopoeia 2000, Deluxe Edition, Tarascon Publishing, Loma Linda, Calif. (2000), and other medical texts. However, it is well within the skilled artisan's purview to determine the second therapeutic agent's optimal effective-amount range. In one embodiment of the invention, where a second therapeutic agent is administered to a subject, the effective amount of the compound of this invention is less than its effective amount would be where the second therapeutic agent is not administered. In another embodiment, the effective amount of the second therapeutic agent is less than its effective amount would be where the compound of this invention is not administered. In this way, undesired side effects associated with high doses of either agent may be minimized. Other potential advantages (including without limitation improved dosing regimens and/or reduced drug cost) will be apparent to those of skill in the art. In yet another aspect, the invention provides the use of a compound of Formula I or II alone or together with one or more of the above-described second therapeutic agents in the manufacture of a medicament, either as a single composition or as separate dosage forms, for treatment or prevention in a patient of a disease, disorder or symptom set forth above. Another aspect of the invention is a compound of Formula I or II for use in the treatment or prevention in a patient of a disease, disorder or symptom thereof delineated herein. Diagnostic Methods and Kits The compounds and compositions of this invention are also useful as reagents in methods for determining the concentration of anacetrapib in solution or biological sample such as plasma, examining the metabolism of anacetrapib and other analytical studies. According to one embodiment, the invention provides a method of determining the concentration, in a solution or a biological sample, of anacetrapib, comprising the steps of: a) adding a known concentration of a compound of Formula I or II to the solution of biological sample;b) subjecting the solution or biological sample to a measuring device that distinguishes anacetrapib from a compound of Formula I or II;c) calibrating the measuring device to correlate the detected quantity of the compound of Formula I or II with the known concentration of the compound of Formula I or II added to the biological sample or solution; andd) measuring the quantity of anacetrapib in the biological sample with said calibrated measuring device; ande) determining the concentration of anacetrapib in the solution of sample using the correlation between detected quantity and concentration obtained for a compound of Formula I or II. Measuring devices that can distinguish anacetrapib from the corresponding compound of Formula I or II include any measuring device that can distinguish between two compounds that differ from one another only in isotopic abundance. Exemplary measuring devices include a mass spectrometer, NMR spectrometer, or IR spectrometer. In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of evaluating the metabolic stability of a compound of Formula I or II comprising the steps of contacting the compound of Formula I or II with a metabolizing enzyme source for a period of time and comparing the amount of the compound of Formula I or II with the metabolic products of the compound of Formula I or II after the period of time. In a related embodiment, the invention provides a method of evaluating the metabolic stability of a compound of Formula I or II in a patient following administration of the compound of Formula I or II. This method comprises the steps of obtaining a serum, urine or feces sample from the patient at a period of time following the administration of the compound of Formula I or II to the subject; and comparing the amount of the compound of Formula I or II with the metabolic products of the compound of Formula I or II in the serum, urine or feces sample. The present invention also provides kits for use to treat. These kits comprise (a) a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of Formula I or II or a salt, hydrate, or solvate thereof, wherein said pharmaceutical composition is in a container; and (b) instructions describing a method of using the pharmaceutical composition to treat. The container may be any vessel or other sealed or sealable apparatus that can hold said pharmaceutical composition. Examples include bottles, ampules, divided or multi-chambered holders bottles, wherein each division or chamber comprises a single dose of said composition, a divided foil packet wherein each division comprises a single dose of said composition, or a dispenser that dispenses single doses of said composition. The container can be in any conventional shape or form as known in the art which is made of a pharmaceutically acceptable material, for example a paper or cardboard box, a glass or plastic bottle or jar, a re-sealable bag (for example, to hold a "refill" of tablets for placement into a different container), or a blister pack with individual doses for pressing out of the pack according to a therapeutic schedule. The container employed can depend on the exact dosage form involved, for example a conventional cardboard box would not generally be used to hold a liquid suspension. It is feasible that more than one container can be used together in a single package to market a single dosage form. For example, tablets may be contained in a bottle, which is in turn contained within a box. In one embodiment, the container is a blister pack. The kits of this invention may also comprise a device to administer or to measure out a unit dose of the pharmaceutical composition. Such device may include an inhaler if said composition is an inhalable composition; a syringe and needle if said composition is an injectable composition; a syringe, spoon, pump, or a vessel with or without volume markings if said composition is an oral liquid composition; or any other measuring or delivery device appropriate to the dosage formulation of the composition present in the kit. In certain embodiment, the kits of this invention may comprise in a separate vessel of container a pharmaceutical composition comprising a second therapeutic agent, such as one of those listed above for use for co-administration with a compound of this invention.

Evaluation of Metabolic Stability Certain in vitro liver metabolism studies have been described previously in the following references, each of which is incorporated herein in their entirety: Obach, RS, Drug Metab Disp, 1999, 27:1350; Houston, JB et al., Drug Metab Rev, 1997, 29:891; Houston, JB, Biochem Pharmacol, 1994, 47:1469; Iwatsubo, T et al., Pharmacol Ther, 1997, 73:147; and Lave, T, et al., Pharm Res, 1997, 14:152. Microsomal Assay: The metabolic stability of compounds of Formula I or II is tested using pooled liver microsomal incubations. Full scan LC-MS analysis is then performed to detect major metabolites. Samples of the test compounds, exposed to pooled human liver microsomes, are analyzed using HPLC-MS (or MS/MS) detection. For determining metabolic stability, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) is used to measure the disappearance of the test compounds. For metabolite detection, Q1 full scans are used as survey scans to detect the major metabolites. Experimental Procedures: Human liver microsomes are obtained from a commercial source (e.g., XenoTech, LLC (Lenexa, KS)). The incubation mixtures are prepared as follows: Reaction Mixture Composition Liver Microsomes 0.5-2.0 mg/mL NADPH 1 mM Potassium Phosphate, pH 7.4 100 mM Magnesium Chloride 10 mM Test Compound 0.1-1 µM. Incubation of Test Compounds with Liver Microsomes: The reaction mixture, minus cofactors, is prepared. An aliquot of the reaction mixture (without cofactors) is incubated in a shaking water bath at 37°C for 3 minutes. Another aliquot of the reaction mixture is prepared as the negative control. The test compound is added into both the reaction mixture and the negative control at a final concentration of 1 µM. An aliquot of the reaction mixture is prepared as a blank control, by the addition of plain organic solvent (not the test compound). The reaction is initiated by the addition of cofactors (not into the negative controls), and then incubated in a shaking water bath at 37°C. Aliquots (200 µL) are withdrawn in triplicate at multiple time points (e.g., 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 minutes) and combined with 800 µL of ice-cold 50/50 acetonitrile/dH2O to terminate the reaction. The positive controls, testosterone and propranolol, as well as anacetrapib, are each run simultaneously with the test compounds in separate reactions. All samples are analyzed using LC-MS (or MS/MS). An LC-MRM-MS/MS method is used for metabolic stability. Also, Q1 full scan LC-MS methods are performed on the blank matrix and the test compound incubation samples. The Q1 scans serve as survey scans to identify any sample unique peaks that might represent the possible metabolites. The masses of these potential metabolites can be determined from the Q1 scans. SUPERSOMES™ Assay. Various human cytochrome P450-specific SUPERSOMES™ are purchased from Gentest (Woburn, MA, USA). A 1.0 mL reaction mixture containing 25 pmole of SUPERSOMES™, 2.0mM NADPH, 3.0mM MgCl, and 1µM of a compound of Formula I or II in 100mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was incubated at 37°C in triplicate. Positive controls contain 1 µM of anacetrapib instead of a compound of Formula I or II. Negative controls used Control Insect Cell Cytosol (insect cell microsomes that lacked any human metabolic enzyme) purchased from GenTest (Woburn, MA, USA). Aliquots (50 µL) are removed from each sample and placed in wells of a multi-well plate at various time points (e.g., 0, 2, 5, 7, 12, 20, and 30 minutes) and to each aliquot is added 50µL of ice cold acetonitrile with 3µM haloperidol as an internal standard to stop the reaction. Plates containing the removed aliquots are placed in -20 °C freezer for 15 minutes to cool. After cooling, 100 µL of deionized water is added to all wells in the plate. Plates are then spun in the centrifuge for 10 minutes at 3000 rpm. A portion of the supernatant (100 µL) is then removed, placed in a new plate and analyzed using Mass Spectrometry.
