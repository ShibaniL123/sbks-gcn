Step 3
2-(4-(Methoxymethoxy)-3-(methylthio)phenyl)-5,5-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane (39)
To a stirred solution of 2-(4-(methoxymethoxy)phenyl)-5,5-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane (1.5 g, 5.95 mmol) in THF (15 mL) at −78° C. was added n-BuLi (9 ml, 8.9 mmol, 1.5 eq). The reaction mixture was slowly allowed to attain room temperature and stirred for 20 minutes; the reaction mixture was again cooled to −78° C. and was added dimethyl disulfide (2 ml, 17.85 mmol). The reaction mixture was slowly allowed to attain room temperature and stirred for 3 h. The reaction mixture was quenched with water (20 ml) and extracted with ethyl acetate (2×25 mL). The combined organic layer was washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure to get 2-(4-(methoxymethoxy)-3-(methylthio)phenyl)-5,5-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane (1.5 g, yield: 100% LC-MS: 91.59%) as a colourless liquid.
