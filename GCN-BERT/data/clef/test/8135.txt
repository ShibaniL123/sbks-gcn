Example 22
4-{[(6,8-Dichloro-3-methyl-2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)carbonyl]amino}bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1-carboxylic acid
130 mg (0.24 mmol, purity 90%) of the compound from Example 63A were dissolved in 4.4 ml of a THF/methanol mixture (5:1), 1.18 ml (1.18 mmol) of a 1 M lithium hydroxide solution were added and the mixture was then stirred at 50Â° C. for 3 h. After cooling to RT, the mixture was adjusted to pH 1-2 by addition of 4 M hydrochloric acid and purified by preparative HPLC (Method 2). This gave 67 mg (57% of theory, purity 97%) of the title compound
