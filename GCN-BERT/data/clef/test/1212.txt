BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to substituted spiropiperidinyl derivatives that are useful in the pharmaceutical field. The compounds act as GPR120 receptor function regulating agents (modulators), which are useful as drugs for treating and/or preventing diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and inflammation related disorders. GPR120, a G protein-coupled receptor, causes intracellular signaling through binding with unsaturated long chain fatty acids, such as alpha-linoleic acid, to induce various biological reactions. Actions of GPR120 and its ligand have been reported to promote secretion of glucagon-like-peptide-1 (“GLP-1”) functions to reduce blood glucose level in gastrointestinal cell lines. see Nature Medicine, 2005, 11(1), 90-94. GLP-1, which is a peptide hormone, has been found to induce insulin secretion depending on a blood glucose level. GLP-1 is also suggested to be efficacious for delaying the apoptosis of beta cells in type II diabetes mellitus. GPR120 is expressed in adipocytes. GPR120 has been found to be increasingly expressed by adipose differentiation induction. In addition, actions of GPR120 and one of its putative ligand have been reported to suppress lipolysis in adipose-differentiated cells. A high blood lipid level is known to be one of the causes of insulin resistance. Suppression of lipolysis by a GPR120 agonist is thus expected to decrease the level of free fatty acid in blood to normalize a blood lipid level, resulting in improvement in insulin resistance. GPR120 is also expressed in the pituitary gland, and a GPR120 ligand is reported to suppress adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion. Adrenocorticotropic hormone promotes glucocorticoid secretion downstream thereof to induce action such as promotion of glyconeogenesis in the liver, inhibitory action against glucose uptake in muscle and peripheral tissue, lipolysis in adipose tissue or release of fatty acid or glycerol. Accordingly, GPR120 is considered to exhibit hypoglycemic action or blood lipid lowering action via suppression action against adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion even in the central nervous system. Recently, GPR120 has been shown to play a role in obesity in both mice and humans. GPR120 knockout mice fed a high fat diet developed obesity, glucose intolerance and fatty liver with decreased adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis and enhanced hepatic lipogenesis. In the study, insulin resistance in such mice was associated with reduced insulin signaling and enhanced inflammation in adipose tissue. In human, GPR120 expression in adipose tissue is significantly higher in obese individuals than in lean controls. See Ichimura, et al., Nature, 2012, 483, 350-54; and Cintra, et al., Plos One, 2012, 7(1), 1-15. GPR120 has also been shown to play a role in inflammation. Wild-type mice treated with omega-3 fatty acids inhibited macrophage-induced tissue inflammation and enhanced systemic insulin sensitivity. However, this effect was not observed in GPR120 knockout mice. See Oh, et al., Cell, 2010, 142, 687; and Talukar, et al., Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 2011, 32(9), 543-550. In light of the above description, a compound having GPR120 agonist activity is considered to be useful as an agent for treating and/or preventing diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and inflammation related disorders.

In the compounds described herein, the atoms may exhibit their natural isotopic abundances, or one or more of the atoms may be artificially enriched in a particular isotope having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number predominantly found in nature. The present invention is meant to include all suitable isotopic variations of the compounds of the formulas described herein. For example, different isotopic forms of hydrogen (H) include protium (1H) and deuterium (2H). Protium is the predominant hydrogen isotope found in nature. Enriching for deuterium may afford certain therapeutic advantages, such as increasing in vivo half-life or reducing dosage requirements, or may provide a compound useful as a standard for characterization of biological samples. Isotopically-enriched compounds within the formulas described herein can be prepared without undue experimentation by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the Schemes and Examples herein using appropriate isotopically-enriched reagents and/or intermediates. The individual tautomers of the compounds of the formulas described herein, as well as mixture thereof, are encompassed with compounds of the formulas described herein. Tautomers are defined as compounds that undergo rapid proton shifts from one atom of the compound to another atom of the compound. Some of the compounds described herein may exist as tautomers with different points of attachment of hydrogen. Such an example may be a ketone and its enol form known as keto-enol tautomers. Compounds of the formulas described herein may be separated into diastereoisomeric pairs of enantiomers by, for example, fractional crystallization from a suitable solvent. The pair of enantiomers thus obtained may be separated into individual stereoisomers by conventional means, for example by the use of an optically active amine or acid as a resolving agent or on a chiral HPLC column. Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound of the formulas described herein may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration. It is generally preferable to administer compounds of the present invention as enantiomerically pure formulations. Racemic mixtures can be separated into their individual enantiomers by any of a number of conventional methods. These include chiral chromatography, derivatization with a chiral auxiliary followed by separation by chromatography or crystallization, and fractional crystallization of diastereomeric salts. Compounds described herein may contain an asymmetric center and may thus exist as enantiomers. Where the compounds according to the invention possess two or more asymmetric centers, they may additionally exist as diastereomers. When bonds to the chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the formulas of the invention, it is understood that both the (R) and (S) configurations of the chiral carbon, and hence both enantiomers and mixtures thereof, are embraced within the formulas. The present invention includes all such possible stereoisomers as substantially pure resolved enantiomers, racemic mixtures thereof, as well as mixtures of diastereomers. Except where otherwise specified, the formulae encompassing compounds of the present invention are shown without a definitive stereochemistry at certain positions. The present invention therefore may be understood to include all stereoisomers of compounds of Formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. Diastereoisomeric pairs of enantiomers may be separated by, for example, fractional crystallization from a suitable solvent, and the pair of enantiomers thus obtained may be separated into individual stereoisomers by conventional means, for example by the use of an optically active acid or base as a resolving agent or on a chiral HPLC column. Further, any enantiomer or diastereomer of a compound of the general Formula I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration. Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for compounds of the present invention may exist as polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present invention.

For dosing purposes, any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human, with an effective amount of a compound of the present invention. Dosage forms may include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like. Most preferably, compounds of the formulas described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof are administered orally. The effective dosage of active ingredient employed may vary depending on the particular compound employed, the mode of administration, the condition being treated and the severity of the condition being treated. Such dosage may be ascertained readily by a person skilled in the art. When treating or controlling diabetes mellitus or other diseases for which compounds of the formulas described herein are indicated, generally satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds of the present invention are administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 milligram to about 100 milligram per kilogram of animal body weight, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. For most large mammals, the total daily dosage is from about 1.0 milligrams to about 1000 milligrams. In the case of a 70 kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be from about 1 milligram to about 350 milligrams. For a particularly potent compound, the dosage for an adult human may be as low as 0.1 mg. The dosage regimen may be adjusted within this range or even outside of this range to provide the optimal therapeutic response. Oral administration will usually be carried out using tablets or capsules. Examples of doses in tablets and capsules are 0.1 mg, 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 1.5 mg, 2 mg, 2.5 mg, 3 mg, 3.5 mg, 4 mg, 4.5 mg, 5 mg, 5.5 mg, 6 mg, 6.5 mg, 7 mg, 7.5 mg, 8 mg, 8.5 mg, 9 mg, 9.5 mg, 10 mg, 12 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 350 mg, 500 mg, 700 mg, 750 mg, 800 mg and 1000 mg. Other oral forms may also have the same or similar dosages. Another aspect of the invention that is of interest is a pharmaceutical composition comprised of a compound of the formulas described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of the formulas described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as an active ingredient, as well as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids. Salts of basic compounds encompassed within the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refer to non-toxic salts of the compounds described herein which are generally prepared by reacting the free base with a suitable organic or inorganic acid. Representative salts of basic compounds described herein include, but are not limited to, the following: acetate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bicarbonate, bisulfate, bitartrate, borate, bromide, camsylate, carbonate, chloride, clavulanate, citrate, edetate, edisylate, estolate, esylate, formate, fumarate, gluceptate, gluconate, glutamate, hexylresorcinate, hydrobromide, hydrochloride, hydroxynaphthoate, iodide, isothionate, lactate, lactobionate, laurate, malate, maleate, mandelate, mesylate, methylbromide, methylnitrate, methylsulfate, mucate, napsylate, nitrate, N-methylglucamine ammonium salt, oleate, oxalate, palmitate, pamoate (embonate), pantothenate, phosphate/diphosphate, polygalacturonate, salicylate, stearate, sulfate, subacetate, succinate, tannate, tartrate, teoclate, tosylate, triethiodide and valerate. Furthermore, where the compounds described herein carry an acidic moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include, but are not limited to, salts derived from inorganic bases including aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic, mangamous, potassium, sodium, zinc, and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium salts. Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, cyclic amines, and basic ion-exchange resins, such as arginine, betaine, caffeine, choline, N,N-dibenzylethylenediamine, diethylamine, 2-diethylaminoethanol, 2-dimethylaminoethanol, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-ethylmorpholine, N-ethylpiperidine, glucamine, glucosamine, histidine, isopropylamine, lysine, methylglucamine, morpholine, piperazine, piperidine, polyamine resins, procaine, purines, theobromine, triethylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tromethamine, and the like. A pharmaceutical composition may also comprise a prodrug, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, if a prodrug is administered. The compositions are typically suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (ophthalmic), pulmonary (nasal or buccal inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated and on the particular active ingredient selected. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art. In practical use, compounds of the formulas described herein, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with the pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage form. Solid pharmaceutical carriers are therefore typically employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such compositions and preparations typically comprise at least about 0.1 percent of active compound, the remainder of the composition being the carrier. The percentage of active compound in these compositions may, of course, be varied and is conveniently between about 2 percent to about 60 percent of the weight of the dosage form. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be delivered. Alternatively, the active compound can be administered intranasally as, for example, in the form of liquid drops or a spray. The tablets, capsules and the like also typically contain a binder. Examples of suitable binders include gum tragacanth, acacia, gelatin and a synthetic or semisynthetic starch derivative, such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC); excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and in some instances, a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When the dosage form employed is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to the components described above, a liquid carrier such as fatty oil. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. Syrups and elixirs typically contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl or propylparabens as a preservative, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor. The compound of the formulas described herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or suspensions of these active compounds can be prepared in water, saline or another biocompatible vehicle, suitably mixed with a surfactant, buffer, and the like. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in an oil. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations can also contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms. The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions and dispersions, and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions and dispersions. The preparation should be prepared under sterile conditions and be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It should be sufficiently stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and preserved against the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and suitable oils.

The compounds of the present invention may be used in combination with one or more other drugs in the treatment, prevention, suppression or amelioration of diseases or conditions for which compounds of formula I or the other drugs may have utility, where the combination of the drugs together are safer or more effective than either drug alone. Such other drug(s) may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefore, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of formula I. When a compound of formula I is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition in unit dosage form containing such other drugs and the compound of formula I is preferred. However, the combination therapy may also include therapies in which the compound of formula I and one or more other drugs are administered on different overlapping schedules. It is also contemplated that when used in combination with one or more other active ingredients, the compounds of the present invention and the other active ingredients may be used in lower doses than when each is used singly.

Reaction Schemes below illustrate the methods employed in the synthesis of the compounds of the present invention of Formula I. All substituents are as defined above unless indicated otherwise. The synthesis of the novel compounds of the present invention may be accomplished by one or more of the synthetic schemes described herein. Compounds can be prepared using a variety of methods which will become apparent to those of ordinary skill from the teaching herein, one such route being illustrated in Scheme 1. Formylpiperidine 1 is treated with MVK in the presence of a base such as potassium tert-butoxide in a solvent such as MTBE at temperatures of zero to 30° C. The reaction is stirred a further 30 min before isolation of intermediate 2 with an aqueous work-up. Reaction of 2 with deprotonated phosphonate carbanions by a base such as NaH in a solvent such as THF at temperatures of 0° C. to 50° C. generates intermediate 3. Upon reduction with, for example hydrogen and a palladium catalyst, and Boc deprotection under acidic conditions such as 4 N HCl, the spirocyclic intermediate 5 is readily prepared. Carbon-nitrogen cross-coupling of 5 with substituted arylbromides in the presence of a phosphine ligand such as SPhos, a palladium catalyst precursor, such as Pd2(dba)3, and a base such as cesium carbonate, in a solvent such as dioxane with heating, followed by saponification of the ester 6 using a base such as lithium hydroxide in a polar solvent such as THF, MeOH, water or a mixture of similar solvents, yields the desired compound 7. C—N cross-coupling partners arylbromides are commercially available, or readily prepared by those skilled in the art, for example by O-alkylation of the corresponding bromophenols with, for example alkylbromides in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate. As illustrated in Scheme 2, an oxaspiropipedine Int 1 is reacted with an aryl halide such as an aryl bromide in the presence of a palladium catalyst, a ligand such as Sphos, and a base such as cesium carbonate, in a solvent such as dioxane at elevated temperature to afford the N-arylated oxaspiropiperidine Int-2. Upon saponification, the ester Int-2 is converted to the carboxylic acid product Int-3. Alternatively compounds Int-3 can be synthesized by reacting cyanomethyl substituted oxaspiropiperidines Int-5, after removal of Boc protection group of compounds Int-4, with an aryl halide such as an aryl bromide in similar C—N cross coupling conditions to provide compounds Int-6, which are then hydrolyzed to form the carboxylic acids. For some instances the intermediates Int-6 can be further modified if desired, for example, by reaction with sodium azide at elevated temperature, such as microwave irridiation, to provide the tetrazole final compounds Int-7. The depicted oxaspiropiperidines Int-1 can be obtained commercially, are known in the literature (Tetrahedron Lett., 2011, 52, 6457) and may be prepared by a variety of methods by those skilled in the art. One such example for forming Int-1a is shown in Scheme 2, involving reduction of the methylester Int-8 to methylene alcohol Int-9. Mesylation of the alcohol by treatment with MsC1 and bases such as triethylamine and DMAP to yield Int-10, followed by cyano replacement with potassium cyanide, can provide Int-4a. Hydrolysis with a base such as potassium hydroxide can readily convert Int-4a to the corresponding carboxylic acid Int-11, which can then be conveniently transformed to the ester Int-1a when being subjected to (trimethylsilyl)diazomethane or sulfuric acid in the presence of an alcohol such as ethanol. As will be known to those skilled in the art, in all schemes, the products of Formula I and all synthetic intermediates may be purified from unwanted side products, reagents and solvents by recrystallization, trituration, preparative thin layer chomatography, flash chomatography on silica gel as described by W. C. Still et al, J. Org. Chem. 1978, 43, 2923, or reverse-phase HPLC. Compounds purified by HPLC may be isolated as the corresponding salt. Additionally, in some instances the final compounds of Formula I and synthetic intermediates may be comprised of a mixture of cis and trans isomers, enantiomers or diastereomers. As will be known to those skilled in the art, such cis and trans isomers, enantiomers and diastereomers may be separated by various methods including crystallization, chromatography using a homochiral stationary phase and, in the case of cis/trans isomers and diastereomers, normal-phase and reverse-phase chomatography. Chemical reactions were monitored by LCMS, and the purity and identity of the reaction products were assayed by LCMS (electrospray ionization) and NMR. 1H NMR spectra are internally referenced to residual protio solvent signals. Data for 1H NMR are reported with chemical shift (δ ppm), multiplicity (s=singlet, d=doublet, t=triplet, q=quartet, m=multiplet, br s=broad singlet, br m=broad multiplet), coupling constant (Hz), and integration. Unless otherwise noted, all LCMS ions listed are [M+H]. All temperatures are degrees Celsius unless otherwise noted. In the Examples, some intermediates and final compounds having a chiral carbon were prepared as racemates. The term “rac” refers to a racemic mixture. Preparative HPLC was performed on either a YMC-Pack Pro C18 column (100×20 mm i.d.) or a Waters XBridge C18 column (100×19 mm i.d.), or a Waters Sunfire C18 column (100×19 mm i.d.).
