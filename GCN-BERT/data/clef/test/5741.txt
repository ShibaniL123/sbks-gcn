Step 2: (S)-tert-Butyl 4-((2-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylacetoxy)methyl)-piperidine-1-carboxylate
A stirred solution of (S)-2-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylacetic acid (10.69 g, 43.77 mmol) in DMF (30 mL) was added with potassium hydrogen carbonate (8.76 g, 87.5 mmol) and the mixture stirred at room temperature for 10 minutes. A solution of tert-butyl 4-(tosyloxymethyl)piperidine-1-carboxylate (16.17 g, 43.77 mmol) in DMF (55 mL) was added and the reaction mixture heated at 60° C. for 27 hours. Diluted with ethyl acetate and washed with aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate (×2), brine and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The filtrate was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue purified by flash column chromatography (eluent-100% iso-hexane to 2:3 iso-hexane/ethyl acetate) to afford the title compound (13.42 g, 69%).
