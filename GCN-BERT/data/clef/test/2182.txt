Example 33B
4-(1-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopropyl)phenol
To a solution of 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-(4-(1-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopropyl)phenyl)-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (1.8 g, 5.77 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (30 mL), cooled with ice, was added dropwise a solution of aqueous sodium hydroxide (3 mL, 3 M), and the mixture was stirred at 0° C. for 0.5 hours. Hydrogen peroxide (30 weight %, 3 mL, 29.4 mmol) was added over a period of 5 minutes. The reaction was allowed to warm to 25° C. and stirring was continued for 12 hours. The reaction mixture was quenched by the addition of saturated aqueous NaHSO3. Water was added. The mixture was extracted with diethyl ether (100 mL), and the organic layer was washed with saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure to give the title compound 4-(1-(trifluoromethyl)cyclopropyl)phenol (1.16 g, 100% yield).
