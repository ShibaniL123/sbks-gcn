For treatment, the appropriate dosage will, of course, vary depending upon, for example, the chemical nature and the pharmakokinetic data of a compound of the present invention employed, and the individual host, the mode of administration and the nature and severity of the conditions being treated. However, in general, for satisfactory results in larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated daily dosage is in the range from about 0.01 g to about 2.0 g of a compound of the present invention; conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times a day. The process of producing the above identified compounds is exemplified by the reaction scheme in FIG. 1. It is to be understood, that the reaction scheme is only a preferred example of the process for producing compounds according to the present invention. For example, compound 11 can be obtained by esterification of clavulanic acid. Subsequently, according to method A1, compound 11 is oxidized with a suitable oxidant. One option of converting the hydroxyl group of compound 11 to an aldehyde group is the Dess Martin oxidation procedure using Dess Martin's periodinane reagent. According to methods B1 to B3, compound 12 is reacted with a suitable nucleophilic agent to form compound 13. Method B1 preferably is a palladium catalyzed nucleophilic substitution reaction. In method B2, 1,4-dibromobutene and K2CO3 preferably react with compound 12, whereby the substituted compound 13 is obtained. Subsequently, in method B3, the obtained product of method B2 may be converted into the corresponding azido derivative using preferably tetrabutyl ammonium azide as reagent. For obtaining alcohol 14 compound 13 can be reduced with a suitable reducing agent. Said method C2 may be carried out using NaBH4 as reducing agent. Optionally, in method E1 the ester group of alcohol 14 may be cleaved to form the corresponding carboxylic acid 15. According to method C1, aldehyde 13 is oxidized with an appropriate oxidant, thereby forming carboxylic acid derivative 16. In a preferred embodiment carboxylic acid derivatives 16a and 16b may be formed as mixture of both E- and Z-isomers in the aforementioned oxidation reaction. If the substituent R6 is hydrogen as in compound 16a the configuration of the double bond of the alkenyl moiety preferably is Z. It the substituent R7 is hydrogen as in compound 16b, the product obtained is preferably only one of the possible E or Z-isomers. In method E1 the ester group of the Z-isomer 16a is cleaved with an appropriate agent, thereby forming the dicarboxylic acid derivative 17. Compound 16b may optionally be converted to diester 18 by an appropriate esterification process (Method F1, R9 is as defined for R1). In method D1 the 5-membered ring of compound 19 is formed by reacting compound 16b with a suitable ring forming agent. In the ring forming reaction D1 the substituent R6 of compound 16b preferably is an allyl or substituted allyl group. The cyclization reaction preferably is catalyzed with iodine, thereby forming compound 19 whereby R is an iodated alkyl or substituted alkyl group. According to one method, compound 19 may be dehalogenated using preferably a palladium catalyzed dehalogenation reaction. Alternatively, according to another method, if R in compound 19 is an iodated alkyl or substituted alkyl group, said compound may be converted into the corresponding azido derivative. Compound 20 may be obtained by cleaving the ester group of compound 19. Said cleaving reaction preferably is a reductive ester cleavage reaction. In case that R is an alkyl group substituted with an azido group, said azido group is preferably reduced as well simultaneously. A person skilled in the art will recognize several alternatives of the described specific reactions with which the same reaction products may be obtained.

The inhibitory activity of the compounds of the present invention on β-lactamases is shown by the following examples: Cell-Free-β-Lactamase Inhibition Study The inhibitory concentrations (IC50, [μM]) of the β-lactamase inhibitors against purified TEM-1, SHV-1 and AmpC β-lactamases are assessed by determining the concentration of inhibitor at which 50% of the nitrocefin hydrolysis is inhibited by the particular enzyme. Assays are performed with β-lactamases expressed in the pET system (Novagen, San Diego, Calif.) without signal peptides. They contain an N-terminal hexa-Histidine tag that is used for purification on Ni-NTA (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The compounds are prepared as 50 mM stocks in DMSO and diluted into buffer P1 (50 mM phosphate, pH 7) to a final concentration of 10% DMSO. All further dilutions are done in P2 (P1 with 10% DMSO). Enzyme and compound dilutions are pre-incubated for 10 min at 37° C. and the reaction is started with the addition of pre-warmed (37° C.) nitrocefin at a final concentration of 50 mM. The change in absorption at 490 nm is followed at 37° C. for 10 min with 30 s intervals in a SPECTRAMAX 384 PLUS microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif.) using 96 well plates.

M7-A4). Lipophilic compounds with low water solubility are first dissolved in DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide, 20%) and further diluted with water or Mueller Hinton Bouillon (MHB). All drug weights are corrected for salt forms and refer to the pure drug substance. Bacterial Strains: All tested strains and clinical isolates are either purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), kindly supplied by A. Georgopoulos (Vienna General Hospital, Vienna, Austria), and I. Chopra (Leeds, UK), collected from the SENTRY study (F. J. Schmitz, Minden, Germany) or from the Sandoz culture collection. All strain identities are confirmed by BBL Crystal™ Identification Systems (Beckton Dickinson, Cockeysville, Md., USA). Stock cultures are prepared from broth cultures grown at 35° C. for 18-22 h without agitation and subsequent addition of 5% DMSO (v/v, final concentration) as cryoprotectant and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen. The presence of β-lactamase genes is proved by PCR using primers specific for the respective β-lactamase type. Test Method Bacterial susceptibility, expressed as MIC, is determined by microbroth dilution technique and agar dilution technique as recommended by the approved standard reference recommendations of the NCCLS. The selected antibiotics are diluted by serial twofold dilution ranging from either 256 μg/ml to 0.125 μg/ml or from 25.6 to 0.0125 μg/ml. When combined with β-lactamase inhibitor the inhibitor is added at a constant concentration of 17 or 68 μM. The inoculum is prepared by the direct colony suspension method as described by NCCLS. For this purpose the bacteria are grown on blood agar plates at 35° C. for 24 h. Subsequently 3-5 single colonies are suspended in 5 ml liquid medium. The bacteria are then incubated for 5 h to reach the logarithmic growth phase and subsequently diluted with medium or NaCl (0.86%) to reach a final living cell count equivalent to 108 CFU/ml. Then the bacterial suspension is diluted 1:10 and 1 μl (104 CFU; final inoculoum 105 CFU/ml) is transferred to the test medium containing the antibacterial substances by a multipoint inoculator (Dynatech, Chantilly, Va., USA). The plates are then incubated at 35° C. for 24 h. The MIC is determined optically and defined as the minimum inhibitory concentration [μg/ml] of antibiotic at which no visible bacterial growth occurs. Minimum Inhibitor Concentrations (MIC) of Amoxicillin, Ceftazidime and Cefepime Alone and in the Presence of Compound of Example 49 in the Specified Concentration Amoxicillin Ceftazidime Cefepime MIC, μg/ml MIC, μg/ml MIC, μg/ml ATCC +68 μM +68 μM +17 μM Nr. alone Example 49 alone Example 49 alone Example 49 K. pneumoniae 700603 >25.6 3.2 >25.6 0.2 0.8 0.2 E. cloacae 83989 Not Not >25.6 12.8 0.8 0.8 tested tested C. freundii 7023771 Not Not >25.6 3.2 0.8 0.4 tested tested Pharmakokinetics Compounds of the present invention show bioavailability in animals after subcutane or p.o. administration, as shown in the following examples. The compound of Example 49 resulted after oral application of 25 mg/kg (formulated in 650 mg cremophor EL+1 ml 96% ethanol+4.575 ml 5% glucose in saline) to mice in a peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 2.22 μg/ml after 15 minutes, the AUCtot reached 65.123 μg/ml*minutes, and the Thalf was 18.90 minutes. The subcutaneous application of 10 mg/kg (in 0.05 M NaPO4 buffer, pH 7.2) to mice resulted in a Cmax of 5.6 μg/ml after 5 minutes, the AUCtot was 125.65 μg/ml*min, and a Thalf of 12.27 minutes was reached. The values of the PK parameters were calculated by standard noncompartmental analysis, using Kinetica 4.2 (InnaPhase). Plasma concentration values below the limit of quantification were taken as 0. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the time to reach Cmax were determined from observed data. In-Vivo Antibacterial Activity Compounds of the present invention upon coadministration of an antibiotic show antibacterial activity in animals as shown in the following examples. A sepsis model in female NMRI mice was employed using TEM-1 producing E. coli B269 (clinical isolate) as the infecting bacterial strain. In general, the final inoculum given in 0.3 ml per mouse intraperitoneally represented a 100% lethal concentration for systemic infections within 48 hours. A combination of the β-lactam antibiotic cefepime with the compound of Example 49 was compared to cefepime alone. The subcutaneous treatment schedule for the antibiotic at various doses was simultaneous and 3 hours after infection. The test compound (compound of Example 49) was given by the same route at a fixed dose of 20 mg/kg simultaneously, 1.5, 3, and 4.5 hours after infection. After treatment with the combination of cefepime and the test compound, a dose of e.g. 0.5 mg/kg cefepime lead to survival of all animals in this treatment group, whereas after treatment with comparable doses of the antibiotic alone no animals survived. 1.
