It will be apparent, however, that one or more embodiments may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are schematically shown in order to simplify the drawing. FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a hanging structure according to the first embodiment of the disclosure; FIG. 2 is a side view of FIG. 1. As seen in FIG. 1 and FIG. 2, the hanging structure 10 comprises a main body 12 and the main body 12 has an outer surface 121. The outer surface 121 has a first end 1211 and a second end 1212 opposite to each other. Two first hooks 14 and a second hook 16 are disposed on the first end 1211, and the second hook 16 is located between the two first hooks 14. Each first hook 14 has a hook portion 141 and an elastic arm 18. In this embodiment, the two elastic arms 18 are integrally folded at the second end 1212 and extend to the first end 1211, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. In other embodiments, the two elastic arms may extend from the first end 1211. The two hook portions are connected to the two elastic arms 18 respectively. In this embodiment, the two hook portions 141 integrally extend from the two elastic arms 18 respectively, but the disclosure is not limited thereto. In other embodiments, the hook portion 141 and the elastic arm 18 can be two separated components which are fixed to each other. In this embodiment, the second hook 16 integrally extends from the first end 1211, but it is not limited thereto. The length of the part of each of the two first hooks 14 above the outer surface 121 is longer than the length of the part of the second hook 16 above the outer surface 121. Specifically, the length of the end of the first hook 14, away from the outer surface 121, to the outer surface is D1, while that of the end of the second hook 16, away from the outer surface 121, to the outer surface is D2. As shown in FIG. 2, D1 is greater than D2. In this embodiment, the distance D3 between the first hook 14 and the second end 1212 is greater than the distance D4 between the second hook 16 and the second end 1212 (as shown in FIG. 2), but the disclosure is not limited thereto. FIG. 3 is a perspective view of a case using the hanging structure according to a second embodiment of the disclosure. As seen in FIG. 3, the case 30 comprises the hanging structure 10 of the first embodiment, a hanging rack 20, a connection member 22 and a support rack 24. In this embodiment, the main body 12 further has two connection sections 123 respectively located on the opposite two sides of the outer surface 121. However, in other embodiments, the main body 12 may only have one connection section 123 located on one side of the outer surface 121. The connection member 22 is fixed to the connection section 123 and has a fixing portion 222 via a screw (not shown in the figures). The support rack 24 is fixed to the fixing portion 222 via a screw (not shown in the figures). Thereby, the hanging structure 10, the connection member 22 and the support rack 24 are connected together, so that the connection member 22 and the support rack 24 can be hung on the hanging rack 20 via the hanging structure 10. Now the method for hanging the hanging structure 10 to the hanging rack 20 will be illustrated herein. The hanging rack 20 has at least one rectangular hole 201. When the users want to hang the hanging structure 10 on the hanging rack 20, all they need is to fasten the two first hooks 14 with the rectangular hole 201. FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a case using the hanging structure according to a third embodiment of the disclosure. As seen in FIG. 4, the case 40 comprises a hanging structure 10 of the first embodiment, a hanging rack 50, a connection member 22 and a support rack 24. In this embodiment, the main body 12 further has two connection sections 123 respectively located on the opposite two sides of the outer surface 121. However, in other embodiments, the main body 12 may only have one connection section 123 located on one side of the outer surface 121. The connection member 22 is fixed to the connection section 123 via a screw (not shown in the figures) and has a fixing portion 222. The support rack 24 is fixed to the fixing portion 222 via a screw (not shown in the figures). Thereby, the hanging structure 10, the connection member 22 and the support rack 24 are connected together, so that the connection member 22 and the support rack 24 can be hung on the hanging rack 50 via the hanging structure 10. Now the method for hanging the hanging structure 10 to the hanging rack 50 will be illustrated herein. The hanging rack 50 has an inner surface 501 and at least one round hole 503 penetrating the inner surface 501. When the users want to hang the hanging structure 10 on the hanging rack 50, all they need is to align the second hook 16 with the round hole 503 and fasten them with each other. The length D1 of the part of each of the two first hooks 14 above the outer surface 121 is longer than the length D2 of the part of the second hook 16 above the outer surface 121. Thereby, during this process, the two first hooks 14 are extruded by the inner surface 501 so that the two elastic arms 18 are elastically deformed. Hence, when the second hook 16 is fastened with the round hole 503, the two elastic arms 18 are elastically deformed and this make the hook portions 141 push the inner surface 501. As a result, the second hook 16 is firmly fastened with the round hole 503 so the connection of the hanging structure 10 and the hanging rack 50 is fixedly secured. To sum up, in the hanging structure and the case mentioned above, the hanging structure comprises two first hooks and one second hook. In addition, the length of the part of each of the two first hooks above the outer surface is longer than the length of the part of the second hook above the outer surface. Thereby, this hanging structure can be hung on the rectangular hole or the round hole. Additionally, when the hanging structure is hung on the hanging rack with the round hole, the two first hooks are elastically deformed and push the hanging rack, so the connection between the hanging structure and the hanging rack is fixedly secured. 1.
