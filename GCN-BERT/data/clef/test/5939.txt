FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a purified form of trazodone and trazodone hydrochloride, and the process for preparation thereof. In particular the invention relates to a purified form of trazodone and trazodone hydrochloride comprising less than 15 ppm of alkylating substances of proven or suspected genotoxicity. PRIOR ART Trazodone, or 2-[3-[4-(3-chlorophenyl)-1-piperazinylpropyl]-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]pyridin-3(2H)-one, is an antidepressant which, though having a significant effect on the serotonin receptors, is neither a psychostimulant, nor a MAO inhibitor, nor a tricyclic antidepressant. Furthermore, trazodone possesses analgesic properties. Trazodone alleviates the characteristic symptoms of depression, in particular anxiety, somatization, psychomotor retardation, hypochondria, mood swings, irritability, insomnia, apathy, feeling of fatigue and lack of energy, depressed mood. Trazodone has also proved effective in controlling pronounced essential tremor, probably on account of its serotoninergic activity. Moreover, the antidepressant and anxiolytic properties of trazodone have proved useful in the treatment of symptoms of withdrawal from cocaine, benzodiazepines and alcohol. Besides the above-mentioned activities, its sleep-inducing activity is also very interesting. Trazodone is preferably used medically in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of acid addition. The preferred form is the hydrochloride form obtained by treatment of the free base with hydrochloric acid. Trazodone hydrochloride is represented by the following structural formula: Some economically advantageous methods of preparation of trazodone hydrochloride are described in patents U.S. Pat. No. 3,381,009 and EP 1,108,722. A first method comprises reacting s-triazolo-[4,3-a]-pyridin-3-one of formula I with N-(3-chlorophenyl)-N′-(3-chloropropyl)-piperazine of formula II: A second method comprises reacting 2-(3-chloropropyl)-s-triazolo-[4,3-a]-pyridin-3-one of formula III with N-(3-chlorophenyl)-piperazine of formula IV: A third method comprises reacting 2-(γ-morpholino-propyl)-s-triazolo-[4,3-a]-pyridin-3-one of formula V with 3-chloroaniline of formula VI A fourth method comprises reacting 2-(3-aminopropyl)-s-triazolo[4,3-a]-pyridin-3-one of formula VII with 3-chloro-N,N′-dichloroethylaniline of formula VIII: A fifth method comprises reacting 2-{3-[bis-(2-chloroethyl)-amino)-propyl}2H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyridin-3-one of formula IX with 3-chloroaniline of formula VI. Once trazodone has been obtained, trazodone hydrochloride is easily obtained by reaction with hydrochloric acid, for example by treating an organic solution of trazodone with an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, as described for example in patent EP 1,108,722. Preparation of the aforementioned intermediates from I to IX requires the use of alkylating substances of proven genotoxicity, such as 2,2-dichloroethylamine, used for obtaining compound IV by reaction with compound VI; 1-bromo-3-chloropropane, used for obtaining compound II by reaction with compound IV. Compounds II, III, VIII and IX are also alkylating substances and therefore potentially genotoxic. Apart from the aforementioned alkylating substances, in alternative processes for production of trazodone it may be possible to use similar alkylating substances, for example 2,2-dibromoethylamine or 1,3-dichloropropane. The content of said alkylating substances in the final product, represented by trazodone and trazodone hydrochloride, should be reduced to the least possible amount. In particular, the toxicological threshold for ingestion of these alkylating substances has been determined as 1.5 μg per day. Therefore, assuming a daily dose of 100 mg of trazodone hydrochloride, the quantity of alkylating substances present as impurities in the product should be less than 15 ppm. If, however, we consider the maximum daily dose of 600 mg of trazodone hydrochloride, the quantity of alkylating substances present as impurities in the product should even be less than 2.5 ppm. Unfortunately, the processes of preparation described in the aforementioned patents U.S. Pat. No. 3,381,009 and EP 1,108,722 do not allow the content of these alkylating substances to be reduced to below 15 ppm, let alone below 2.5 ppm. Therefore, the applicant tackled the problem of devising a process for production of trazodone and trazodone hydrochloride that makes it possible to lower the content of these alkylating substances in the final product to below 15 ppm. Moreover, said production process must be economically advantageous and must give high yields of final product. DEFINITIONS In the present description and in the claims given later, the expression “trazodone” means trazodone in the form of free base, whereas the expression “trazodone hydrochloride” means the salt formed by the addition of hydrochloric acid to trazodone. Moreover, in the present description and in the claims given later, the expression “alkylating substances” is used to indicate substances that are capable of introducing an alkyl group in a compound used in the synthesis of trazodone or of an intermediate thereof. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Surprisingly, the applicant found that addition of an aqueous solution comprising a basic compound to a solution of trazodone in an organic solvent reduces the amount of alkylating substances in the final product to below 15 ppm.

Preferably, the recovery step (e) is carried out by separating the aqueous phase from the organic phase comprising the trazodone, and cooling the latter to a temperature below 30° C., preferably below 20° C., and even more preferably below 10° C., to promote the crystallization and precipitation of trazodone, which is finally separated, for example by titration. Advantageously, in the final treatment step (f), the trazodone is preferably dissolved in a suitable organic solvent, selected, for example, from those stated previously for the preparation of the organic phase. The solvent preferred in this step is acetone. The solution thus obtained is treated with an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid as described in patent EP 1,108,722. The precipitate of trazodone hydrochloride is then filtered, washed, and dried according to the conventional techniques known by a person skilled in the art. The trazodone and the trazodone hydrochloride obtained by the process of the present invention are characterized by a content of alkylating substances, of proven or suspected genotoxicity, below 15 ppm. Depending on the production process selected for the production of trazodone and of trazodone hydrochloride, the alkylating substances present as impurities are, for example, 2,2-dichloroethylamine, 1-bromo-3-chloro-propane, N-(3-chlorophenyl)-N′-(3-chloropropyl)-piperazine (formula II), 2-(3-chloropropyl)-s-triazolo-[4,3-a]-pyridin-3-one (formula III), 3-chloro-N,N′-dichloroethyl-aniline (formula VIII), 2-{3-[bis-(2-chloroethyl)-amino]-propyl}-2H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrid in-3-one (formula IX), 2,2-dibromoethylamine, and 1,3-dichloropropane. In particular, the alkylating substances encountered most frequently are represented by 2,2-dichioroethylamine, 1-bromo-3-chloro-propane, and N-(3-chlorophenyl)-N′-(3-chloropropyl)-piperazine. 2,2-Dichioroethylamine (CAS No. 334-22-5) and 1-bromo-3-chloro-propane (CAS No. 109-70-6) are known genotoxic substances as reported in TOXNET, a database published by the National Library of Medicine, US on the website http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/. The genotoxic activity of N-(3-chlorophenyl)-N′-(3-chloropropyl)-piperazine has been assessed on histidine-dependent auxotrophic mutants of Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1537, TA 98 and TA100, and, on tryptophan-dependent mutants of Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA (pKM101), exposed to a solution of N-(3-chlorophenyl)-N′-(3-chloropropyl)-piperazine in dimethylsuiphoxide (DMSO) and using DMSO as negative control. Two independent mutation tests were performed, both in the presence and absence of a liver microsomal fraction (S9 mix) of rat treated with phenobarbital and 5,6-benzoflavone. Tests were standard plate incorporation assays and performed according to the current regulatory guidelines. A substantial increase in reversion to prototrophy was obtained on strain TA1535 in the presence of S9 mix. In the two assays the increase was concentration related and reached, following exposure to 1500 μg per plate of N-(3-chlorophenyl)-N′-(3-chloropropyl)-piperazine, 6.4 and 5.1 times the control value. It was therefore concluded that N-(3-chlorophenyl)-N′-(3-chloropropyl)-piperazine exhibited genotoxic activity in said bacterial system following metabolic activation. Surprisingly, the total content of said alkylating substances in the trazodone or in the trazodone hydrochloride obtained using the process of the present invention was below 15 ppm, preferably less than 10 ppm, and even more preferably less than 2.5 ppm. In the preferred embodiment, the content of each of said alkylating substances in the trazodone or in the trazodone hydrochloride obtained using the process of the present invention was below 1 ppm. Therefore, the present invention also relates to trazodone or trazodone hydrochloride comprising less than 15 ppm of alkylating substances, preferably less than 10 ppm, and even more preferably less than 2.5 ppm. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention also relates to trazodone or trazodone hydrochloride comprising less than 1 ppm, and preferably less than 0.5 ppm, of each alkylating substance. Preferably said alkylating substances are selected from the group comprising 2,2-dichloroethylamine, 1-bromo-3-chloro-propane; and N-(3-chloro-phenyl)-N′-(3-chloropropyl)-piperazine (formula II), 2-(3-chloropropyl)-s-triazolo-[4,3-a]-pyridin-3-one (formula III), 3-chloro-N,N′-dichloroethyl-aniline (formula VIII), 2-{3-[bis-(2-chloroethyl)-amino]-propyl}-2H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyridin-3-one (formula IX), 2,2-dibromoethylamine, and 1,3-dichloro-propane. Even more preferably said alkylating substances are selected from the group comprising 2,2-dichloroethylamine, 1-bromo-3-chloropropane, and N-(3-chlorophenyl)-N′-(3-chloropropyl)-piperazine. The trazodone hydrochloride of the present invention can be used advantageously in the preparation of pharmaceutical compositions mixed with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Thus, the present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the trazodone hydrochloride of the present invention as described previously together with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” means, without particular limitations, any material suitable for the preparation of a pharmaceutical composition that is to be administered to a living being. Such materials, known by a person skilled in the art, are for example antiadherents, binders, disintegrants, fillers, diluents, flavouring agents, colorants, fluidizers, lubricants, preservatives, moistening agents, absorbents, and sweeteners. Useful examples of pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are sugars, such as lactose, glucose or sucrose, starches, such as maize starch, and potato starch, cellulose and derivatives thereof, such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, ethylcellulose, and cellulose acetate, gum tragacanth, malt, gelatin, talc, cocoa butter, waxes, oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, mate oil, and soya oil, glycols such as propylene glycols, polyols, such as glycerol, sorbitol, mannitol, and polyethylene glycol, esters, such as ethyl oleate, and ethyl laurate, agar-agar, buffers, such as magnesium hydroxide, and aluminium hydroxide, alginic acid, water, isotonic solutions, ethanol, buffer solutions, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyanhydrides, and so on. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be represented by any composition that can be used for administration of the trazodone hydrochloride of the present invention, preferably compositions for oral or parenteral administration, for example tablets, lozenges, capsules, solutions, suspensions, dispersions, and syrups. The invention is illustrated by the following examples, though without limiting it.

TABLE 4 Alkylating substances N-(3- 2,2- 1-bromo-3- chlorophenyl)-N′- dichloro- chloro- (3-chloropropyl)- ethylamine propane piperazine Initial content 7 10 50 (ppm) Final content <0.46 <0.2 <0.4 (ppm) The initial and final content of the alkylating substances shown in the above Tables 1 to 4 was determined according to the following procedures. Assay for the Determination of 2,2-dichloroethylamine in Trazodone Hydrochloride by UV/Vis Spectrophotometry The assay is based on the reaction of 2,2-dichloroethylamine with 4-(4-nitrobenzyl)-pyridine according to a modified Friedman-Boger procedure as described in Anal. Chem. 33, 906-910, 1961, “Colorimetric estimation of nitrogen mustards in aqueous media”. Briefly, a solution of 4-(4-nitrobenzyl)pyridine in acetone was added to an aqueous solution of trazodone hydrochloride (0.25 g/ml). The resultant mixture was heated to 100° C. for 20 minutes, and then quickly cooled on an ice bath. 1 ml of acetone and 3 ml of 1N sodium hydroxide were added to the solution. The coloured derivative was then extracted in chloroform (3 ml). The absorbance value at 544 nm was recorded against a blank sample, and the second derivative (δ) was calculated from the value obtained. The content, in ppm, of 2,2-dichloroethylamine in the trazodone hydrochloride was found by using the external standard method. The reaction was specific for 2,2-dichloroethylamine as no coloured derivative was obtained in the conditions described for other alkylating agents such as 1-bromo-3-chloropropane and N-(3-chlorophenyl)-N′-(3-chloropropyl)-piperazine. Linearity was verified from 1 to 10 ppm of 2,2-dichloroethylamine. The accuracy of the calibrators was always between 85 and 115% of the theoretical value. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was set at 1 ppm based on the values of precision (measured as standard deviation, σ) of the blank, as follows: δLLOQ=δblank+10*σ=0.00048+10*0.00024=0.00288 corresponding to 1.1 ppm. The limit of detection (LOD) was set at 0.46 ppm, based on the values of precision (measured as standard deviation, σ) of the blank, as follows: δLLOQ=δblank+3*σ=0.00048+10*0.00024=0.002138 corresponding to 0.46 ppm. The precision was evaluated by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV %) of six determinations. The CV % at 5 ppm was equal to 12.2% and at 10 ppm it was equal to 11.2%. Assay for the Determination of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane in Trazodone Hydrochloride by the Headspace Technique The trazodone hydrochloride was dissolved in a water/methanol solution. After complete dissolution, the solution was put in a headspace autosampler and the content of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane was determined by gas chromatography using a capillary column of medium polarity. The column effluent was monitored using a flame ionization detector. The content of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane was determined as assay limit relative to a standard sample with known content (2 ppm).

Time for thermostatic control 15 minutes Pressurization time 1 minute 100 mg of trazodone hydrochloride was accurately weighed in a 22-ml test tube, then an aqueous solution of methanol at 0.025% (v/v) was added. The test tube was sealed with an aluminium crimp cap and PTFE coated butyl rubber septum and was then put in the headspace autosampler. Linearity was verified from 0.2 to 9.3 ppm of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane, obtaining a correlation coefficient equal to 0.992 (by least squares regression analysis). The limits of detection (LOD) and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were obtained from the signal/noise ratio (S/N) as follows: [in-line-formulae]LOD=3×S/N=0.2 ppm[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]LLOQ=10×S/N=0.5 ppm[/in-line-formulae] The precision, determined on the basis of six repeat determinations, was found to be equal to 3.6% (CV) at 0.5 ppm. The accuracy was determined as recovery %. Within the range of linearity it was always 100% with reference to the theoretical concentration. Assay for the Determination of 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-4-(3-chloropropyl)piperazine (CCP) in Trazodone Hydrochloride by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Coupled to Tandem Mass Spectrometry (HPLC/MS/MS).
