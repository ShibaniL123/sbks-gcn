Step 3
3-((3-Methylisoxazol-5-yl)methyl)cyclohexanol
3-((3-Methylisoxazol-5-yl)methyl)cyclohexanone (2.00 g, 10.4 mmol) was dissolved in methanol (30 mL), sodium borohydride (0.790 g, 20.8 mmol) was added at room temperature, and the reaction solution was stirred at room temperature for 4 hours. The reaction was quenched by addition of water (20 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (30 mL x 2). The organic phase was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (20 mL x 2), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (2:1 petroleum ether / ethyl acetate, Rf = 0.5) to give 3-((3-methylisoxazol-5-yl)methyl)cyclohexanol (1.21 g, as a colorless oil) with a yield of 60%.
