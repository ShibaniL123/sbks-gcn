CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of priority from provisional application No. 61/331,567 filed May 5, 2010, incorporated herein by reference. FIELD The present disclosure relates generally to methods involving magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology, and more particularly to a new method to achieve improved imaging of organs and tissues by suppressing blood pool signal. BACKGROUND In Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), contrast agents are often used to improve depiction of diseased from normal tissue. For instance, contrast agents may improve the sensitivity of MRI to identify myocardial infarction, stroke, tumors, atherosclerosis, tissue necrosis, and other diseased states. However, contrast agents may also increase blood pool signal. This may confound detection of abnormal tissue adjacent to blood. One example of this problem is in the setting of a myocardial infarction. Contrast-enhanced MRI is very useful in detecting myocardial infarction, and allows delineation of infarcted from non-infarcted regions by virtue of the fact that infarcted regions accumulate contrast media to a greater degree (see, e.g., Kim R. J. et al. (1999) Circulation 100:1992-2002). Thus, on a T1-weighted MRI image after administration of a contrast agent with high R1 relaxivity, infarcted myocardium is usually bright (high image intensity) compared with non-infarcted myocardium. Unfortunately, the administration of contrast media also leads to high levels of contrast in the blood, and often it is difficult to delineate the border of infarcted myocardium from the blood in the heart chamber cavity. This may render the infarct undetectable, if small, or at a minimum make it difficult to accurately size the infarct. Another example is in the setting of vascular disease. Differences in contrast uptake within separate components of an atherosclerotic plaque is important to identify but may be difficult to detect since the blood within the lumen is immediately adjacent. These examples concern the cardiovascular system, however, the present disclosure may improve the depiction of diseased tissue from any organ system by suppressing blood pool signal. Traditional “black-blood” MRI techniques have been in clinical use for several years, and are valued parts of the MRI armamentarium (see, e.g., Edelman, R. R. et al. (1991) Radiology 181:655-660; Simonetti, O. P. et al. (1996) Radiology 199:49-57). Moreover, these techniques have been improved to increase efficiency (see, e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,498,946 and 7,315,756). However, these techniques were not designed to image with the use of contrast media and the pulse sequence timing is usually based on the T1 of native blood without contrast media. Thus, these techniques were not intended to provide contrast-enhanced images of tissues, and not surprisingly, work poorly after the administration of contrast. More recently, there have been several attempts to perform contrast-enhanced MRI with the suppression of blood pool signal. These include: (1) an MRI method and apparatus to improve myocardial infarction detection with blood pool signal suppression where the pulse sequence involves the use of a “notched” inversion RF pulse (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,526,307); (2) an MRI method to improve imaging of atherosclerotic plaque with suppression of blood signal where the pulse sequence employs a quadruple inversion-recovery (QIR) preparative pulse (see, e.g., Yarnykh, V. L. et al. (2002) Magn. Reson. Med. 48:899-905); (3) techniques for black-blood imaging of myocardial infarction (see, e.g., Rehwald, W. G. et al. (2007) Proc. Intl. Soc. Magn. Reson. Med. and Salerno, M. et al. (2007) Proc. Intl. Soc. Magn. Reson. Med; see also US 20090005673); and (4) MRI methods for black-blood delayed enhancement of myocardial imaging where the pulse sequence involves a stimulated-echo acquisition mode (STEAM) (see, e.g., Ibrahim, el S. H. et al. (2008) J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 27:229-238). Of the above-enumerated methods, nos. 1-3 work by affecting the longitudinal magnetization of blood in regions outside of the imaged slice in a manner such that at the time when MR data is acquired, signal from blood outside of the imaged slice that flows into the specific region-of-interest is suppressed. Method 4 works in a different manner and behaves similar to spin-echo imaging with respect to blood flow. Irrespective of the specific mechanism, all of these methods are dependent on the speed of blood flow, and blood may be mistaken as part of the anatomy. There have also been attempts to perform contrast-enhanced MRI with improved contrast between tissue and blood pool and yet in a manner that is independent of blood flow velocity. For example, Kellman et al. describe a multi-contrast MRI technique to improve contrast between myocardial infarction and blood pool by acquiring two separate images: a T2-weighted and a T1-weighted image (see, e.g., Kellman, P. et al. (2005) J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 22:605-613). Liu et al. describe a technique that is similar to that described by Kellman et al., but combines the weighting of T2 and T1 in a single image (see, e.g., Liu et al. (2008) J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 28: 1280-1286). Moreover, Foo et al. describe a dual inversion time subtraction method which utilizes two acquisitions at a long and short inversion time to improve delineation between the endocardial borders of an infarct from the ventricular blood pool (see, e.g., Liu, C. Y. et al. supra). Although contrast between tissue and blood pool may be improved by some of the methods described in the paragraph above, the level of blood suppression may be minimal, and none of these methods are considered black-blood techniques. Specifically, these methods may result in images in which the signal of blood pool is higher than that of normal myocardium. SUMMARY The present disclosure relates to an MRI pulse sequence that produces black-blood, contrast-enhanced images of tissues and vascular walls. In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a method of magnetic resonance imaging with blood signal suppression comprising administering a contrast agent to the patient; applying a pulse sequence having a preparatory section designed to modify signal from organ tissue differently than blood pool signal followed by an inversion RF pulse; waiting for a period of time that is sufficiently long to allow organ tissue with dissimilar T1 relaxation times to have disparity in signal, yet short enough so that blood signal has greater negative magnetization than the tissues of interest: and acquiring MRI data from the region-of-interest with a phase sensitive reconstruction. In certain embodiments, the preparatory section comprises one or more RF pulses that imparts weighting from the group consisting of T2, T1rho or magnetization transfer weighting and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the preparatory section comprises one or more RF pulses that imparts T2 weighting. In other embodiments, the preparatory section comprises one or more RF pulses that imparts T1rho weighting. On yet another embodiment, the preparatory section comprises one or more RF pulses that imparts magnetization transfer weighting. In other embodiments, the inversion RF pulse has a flip angle between 90 and 180 degrees.

The term “nonhuman animals” of the disclosure includes all vertebrates, e.g., mammals and non-mammals, such as nonhuman primates, sheep, dog, cat, horse, cow, chickens, amphibians, reptiles, and the like. In certain embodiments, the subject is a human patient.

In preferred embodiments, the contrast agent is a T1 agent with high R1 relaxivity. Description of Embodiments FIG. 1 shows an example magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) system 10 including a data acquisition and display computer 50 coupled to an operator console O, a MRI real-time control sequencer 52, and a MRI subsystem 54. MRI subsystem 54 includes XYZ magnetic gradient coils and associated amplifiers 68, a static Z-axis magnet 69, a digital RF transmitter 62, a digital RF receiver 60, a transmit/receive switch 64, and RF coil(s) 66. As is well known, a dedicated cardiac or torso phased-array coil is typically used for cardiac imaging. Electrocardiogram (ECG) leads L may be used in cardiac imaging to synchronize control sequencer 52 with electrical stimulation of the heart by the brain. The patient may or may not have electrodes L placed for electrocardiographic (ECG) gating. Generally, ECG gating will be useful for examinations of the cardiovascular system. However, ECG gating is not necessary if a single-shot version of the sequence below is used (e.g., data acquired for an image comes from one cycle of the sequence), or if motion of the organ or tissues of interest are minor. Subsystem 54 is controlled in real time by sequencer 52 to generate magnetic and radio frequency fields that stimulate nuclear magnetic resonance (“NMR”) phenomena in an object P (e.g., a human body) to be imaged. Specifically, in step 110 of FIG. 2, contrast media is administered to the patient. The contrast agent should preferably be a T1 agent with high R1 relaxivity. A suitable well known contrast agent (C) such as for example a T1 agent is injected intravenously into the patient P in a well known manner. A resulting image of patient P on display 58 shows features and structures that cannot be seen using X-ray, ultrasound or other medical imaging techniques. In the exemplary illustrative non-limiting implementation, the resulting dark or black blood myocardial viability imaging shows blood and healthy myocardium as black or dark and shows infarcts (including subendocardial infarcts) as bright. Referring to FIG. 2, details of an example data acquisition pulse sequence and associated method are shown. The example pulse sequence consists of the following steps. First, one or more RF pulses are applied as part of a preparatory section 120. The goal of this section is to reduce tissue magnetization more than blood magnetization. This may be accomplished in many possible ways, include, but not limited to, the use of one or more RF pulses that imparts T2 weighting, or T1 rho weighting (longitudinal relaxation in the rotating frame), or magnetization transfer weighting, or a combination of these weightings, or by other weightings. By the end of this section, the magnitude of tissue magnetization should be less than blood magnetization. Second, a non-selective inversion pulse is applied 130. The goal of this section is to result in blood magnetization that is more negative (e.g., closer to −M0) than the other tissues of interest. Third, a wait time interval occurs 140. This wait time is selected so that it is sufficiently long to permit tissue species with dissimilar T1 relaxation times to separate in signal. In general, diseased tissue will have more contrast agent accumulation than normal tissue and thus will have a steeper inversion recovery curve, however, the technology herein will work if diseased tissue has less contrast agent accumulation than normal tissue. FIG. 2 shows an example plot of magnetization (from −M0 to +M0 on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis). The top curve in the upper left-hand corner (during preparatory pulse(s)) represents the magnetization of blood, the dotted curve represents magnetization of tissue with low contrast accumulation, and the solid curve beneath the dotted curve represents magnetization of tissue with high contrast accumulation. Note the appearance of black blood during the wait time after the IR pulse. This black blood condition extends into phase-sensitive readout. A vertical line on the right-hand side of the plot indicates the upper limit of wait time for optimal blood suppression, where the magnetization of blood intersects the magnetization curve for tissue with low contrast accumulation. It is useful that tissue components have a disparity in contrast accumulation. Another constraint on the selection of the wait time is that it should be short enough so that the blood magnetization remains more negative than the other tissues of interest. This will allow the exemplary implementation to produce a black blood image. If the wait time is longer, the magnetization of blood may cross the inversion recovery curve of one or more tissue species. Collecting MRI data at this point will still result in partial blood suppression, but may not result in a black-blood image. The final component is to acquire MRI data in a phase-sensitive manner 150. That is to say, that signal polarity following the inversion pulse is to be retained rather than lost as in a conventional magnitude reconstruction, and image intensity should be proportional to the physical magnetization. There are numerous ways to perform a phase sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) reconstruction. One example approach would be to calibrate the phase through acquisition of a background reference image without an inversion pulse (or long after the inversion pulse) (see, e.g., Rehwald, W. G., supra). Another would be to estimate the phase from the image itself using local statistics (see, e.g., Borrello, J. A. et al. (1990) Magn. Reson. Med. 14:56-67; Xiang, Q. S. et al., (1996) J. Mag. Reson. Imaging 6:775-782). FIG. 3 shows sample images obtained from a subject with a myocardial infarction approximately 20 minutes after administration of 0.15 mmol/kg of gadoversetamide. A traditional delayed enhancement MRI image is shown in panel A. A blood signal suppressed contrast-enhanced image using the methods described in the present disclosure is shown in panel B. The traditional sequence results in a bright-blood image, whereas the image produced using methods according to the present disclosure results in a black-blood image. Furthermore, the subendocardial border between the infarct (arrow) and the left ventricular blood pool is easily discernable using the methods of the present disclosure but is not visible on the traditional image. As shown in FIG. 3, the methods of the present disclosure are particularly useful in improving the visualization of myocardial infarction. As already indicated, however, the present disclosure is not limited to imaging the heart, and will be useful in imaging any tissue or organ in which suppressing blood signal will improve discernment of anatomy and or diseased tissue.
