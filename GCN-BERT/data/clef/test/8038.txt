RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority benefit to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. Nos. 61/789,975 and 61/790,104, both filed on Mar. 15, 2013, the entirety of both of which is herein incorporated by reference for all purposes. FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to a cosmetic composition such as mascara. More specifically, the invention relates to the use of glutamic acid derivatives in anhydrous mascara compositions and mascara emulsion compositions to enhance the depth of color as applied to the eyelashes. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Mascaras are generally used by women to accentuate their lashes—that is, impart color and/or aesthetic effects to eyelashes. In particular, consumers look to mascaras to darken, lengthen, thicken, and curl their lashes. Most mascara compositions contain waxes as a means to obtain all of these attributes. However, waxes have certain undesirable properties when used in a mascara composition. First, waxes are typically opaque solids. Mascaras containing such waxes exhibit more muted colors or require additional amounts of pigments to achieve the same color effect, thus, impairing the mascara's ability to provide the dark coloring desired by consumers. Wax based mascaras make lashes dry and brittle, easily smudge and flake, make the eyelashes clump and stick together, and often feel heavy, sticky and stiff on the lashes. Mascara containing a reduced level of waxes would lessen these characteristics and improve the overall organoleptics of the mascara. Accordingly, mascara compositions that impart a richer, more lustrous appearance than conventional mascaras and that provide depth of color (deep dark coloring), while maintaining or improving any of the other desired attributes of mascara are needed. It would further be desirable to have mascara that has the visual appearance of lengthening and thickening eyelashes while imparting a dramatic color effect. U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,329 to Brieva et al. discloses the use of organic, non-polymeric gelling agents with or without waxes in pigmented emulsions (mascaras) to achieve a viscosity of 4,000 to 2,000,000 centipoise at 25° C. Patent Publication No. WO 2011112804 to Bui et al. discloses cosmetic compositions, including mascaras, incorporating (a) a low molecular mass N-acyl glutamic acid diamide having a straight-chain alkyl group; (b) a low molecular mass N-acyl glutamic acid diamide having a branched-chain alkyl group; (c) at least one gel-promoting solvent; (d) at least one film former; (e) at least one volatile solvent capable of solubilizing the film former; and (f) at least one colorant; and (g) a polyorganosiloxane-containing polymer, wherein the composition has a hardness value ranging from about 30 to about 300 g, a melting point of about 500° C. or higher, and does not require use of wax as a structuring agent. U.S. Publication No. 2009/0280077 to Yoshida et al. discusses amino acid, polyamide resins, and various monoesters gelling agents when used individually in maintaining the usability and stability of cosmetic compositions. Yoshida discloses the combination of the above gelling agents to enhance the usability and stability of cosmetic compositions. U.S. Publication No. 2011/0150793 to Do et al. discloses an anhydrous solid, a semi-solid, or a viscous gel cosmetic composition that is clear or transparent. Do discloses that the cosmetic composition incorporates a mixture of at least two amino acid-based gelatinizing agents, a non-ionic unsaturated fatty alcohol which reduces the dissolution of the gelatinizing agent to allow processing at or below 100° C., an alkyl dimethicone, and an oil and/or polymer component. U.S. Publication No. 2011/0182834 to Do et al. discloses an anhydrous solid, a semi-solid, or a viscous gel cosmetic composition that is clear or translucent. Do discloses that the cosmetic composition incorporates a mixture of at least two amino acid-based gelatinizing agents, a polyamide resin, a non-ionic unsaturated fatty alcohol which reduces the dissolution of the gelatinizing agent to allow processing at or below 115° C., an alkyl dimethicone, and an oil and/or polymer component. U.S. Publication No. 20120164093 discloses the use of glutamide compounds and ethanol to stabilize and thicken water-in-oil emulsions. However, the above-noted literature does not disclose a liquid or viscous liquid mascara emulsion with enhanced depth of color and flexibility. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one embodiment, the current invention relates to a mascara emulsion comprising a non-aqueous phase, an aqueous phase, at least one glutamide based gellant, and at least one pigment. In a further embodiment, the mascara emulsion composition may include a low opacity wax component having a ΔL value less than 8. The mascara emulsions exhibit enhanced depth of color and flexibility post-application to eyelashes without impairing the volumizing and lengthening effects of the mascara. In another embodiment, the current invention relates to an anhydrous mascara composition comprising an anhydrous vehicle, at least one glutamide based gellant, at least one pigment, and a low opacity wax component having a ΔL of less than 8. The composition exhibits enhanced depth of color and flexibility while still maintaining the volumizing and lengthening attributes desired of a mascara.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The present invention provides mascara emulsion compositions and anhydrous mascara compositions exhibiting a greater depth of color and enhanced flexibility when deposited on eyelashes. In some embodiments, the mascara composition of the current invention includes (a) one or more glutamide based gellants, (b) one or more pigments, (c) a non-aqueous phase, (d) an aqueous phase, (e) optionally a low opacity wax component, and (f) optionally a low opacity filler component. The current invention provides for a more transparent cosmetic base for the mascara composition, the base comprising, in the form of an emulsion, the gellants (a), the non-aqueous phase (c), and the aqueous phase (d) (collectively the “cosmetic base” or “base”), and not including constituents such as the wax component (e) and the filler component (f). The cosmetic base is achievable as a consequence of providing s substantially transparent, as hereinafter defined, gel base, defined as the gellant (a) incorporated into the non-aqueous phase (c). This gel base provides structure, yet retains clarity and moreover, allows superior clarity to the mascara emulsion. Accordingly, a heightened depth of the color is obtained from the pigments, as this cosmetic base enhances the color, such as by enhancing the darkening provided by the mascara upon application. In other embodiments, the mascara compositions are anhydrous mascara compositions that comprise (a) one or more gellants derived from the amino acid glutamic acid, (b) one or more low opacity waxes (the “low opacity wax component”), (c) one or more pigments, (d) an anhydrous vehicle, and optionally one or more low opacity fillers (the “low opacity filler component”). The mascaras of the current invention provide a substantially transparent, as hereinafter defined, cosmetic base defined as the stated gellants incorporated into the anhydrous vehicle. This cosmetic base provides structure, yet retains clarity. As used herein anhydrous means that the compositions and vehicle of the invention are substantially water free. “Substantially water free” means that the composition contains 2% or less, especially 1% or less, in particular 0.5% or less water. Such amounts of water may be present solely in the anhydrous vehicle. In other embodiments the composition are free of water by which is meant that no water is intentionally added to the composition other than trace amounts of water that may be associated with the various components as impurities or absorbed into the composition from the environment. The waxes of the low opacity wax component, when present, further structure the mascara and provide volumizing and lengthening of the eyelash, and are selected, as set forth herein, so that the clarity of the cosmetic base and the gel base are minimally affected. Accordingly, a heightened depth of the color is obtained from the pigments, as this cosmetic base enhances the darkening provided by the mascara upon application. Further, if incorporated, the low opacity wax component in the cosmetic base would provide volumizing and lengthening effects, while retaining suitable flexibility as a consequence of the reduced wax levels. In further embodiments, the mascara composition of the current invention may also include polyamide resins, such as ethylenediamine/hydrogenated dimer dilinoleate alkyl amide, as further structuring agents, and/or low opacity fillers, and/or low refractive index fillers, as hereinafter described. It has been found that the above-noted mascaras provide a deeper, darker color, increased depth of color, and enhanced flexibility when applied to eyelashes without impairing the ability of the mascara to add volume and/or length to the eyelashes. As used herein, the term “consisting essentially of” is intended to limit the invention to the specified materials or steps and those materials or steps that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of the claimed invention, for example, loss of transparency and translucency, as understood from a reading of this specification. The terms “a” and “an”, as used herein and in the appended claims, mean “one or more” unless otherwise indicated herein. It should be noted that unless indicated to the contrary, as used herein, percent (%) is % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition. As noted above, in some embodiments, the mascara compositions of the current invention include (a) one or more glutamide based gellants; (b) one or more pigments; (c) a non-aqueous phase; and (d) an aqueous phase disclosed in further detail below. In other embodiments, the mascara compositions of the current invention include (a) one or more gellants based on the amino acid glutamic acid; (b) one or more low opacity waxes; (c) a pigment; and (d) an anhydrous composition disclosed in further detail below. A. Gellants The glutamide based gellants used within the cosmetic composition of the current invention will have the structure according to formula (I): wherein, R1, R2 and R3 are C1-C20 hydrocarbon moieties which may be straight chained, branched, or cyclic and which may comprise one or more heteroatoms selected from oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. R1, R2 and R3 are independently selected at each occurrence and therefore may be the same or different. Preferably, at least one of R1, R2 and R3 is a C5-C20 hydrocarbon moiety and more preferred still, R1 is a C6-C20 hydrocarbon moiety. Typically, each of R1, R2 and R3 are independently selected from branched, straight chain, or cyclic alkyl groups having from three to 20 carbon atoms. R1, R2 and R3 may, for example, each be independently selected from methyl, ethyl, propyl (e.g., n-propyl or isopropyl), butyl (e.g., n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl), pentyl (e.g., n-pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, cyclopentyl), hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, etc. In one embodiment, R1 is selected from branched or straight chain alkyl groups having from five to 16 carbon atoms and R2 and R3 are independently straight chain alkyl groups having from three to six carbon atoms, namely propyl, butyl, pentyl, or hexyl. Preferably, R1 is selected from branched or straight chain alkyl groups having from five to 16 carbon atoms, and R2 and R3 are each n-butyl groups. In one embodiment, R1 is a straight chain undecyl group and the compound of formula (I) is Dibutyl Lauroyl Glutamide. In another implementation, R1 is a branched heptyl group, more specifically a 1-ethylpentyl group, and the compound of formula (I) is Dibutyl Ethylhexanoyl Glutamide, having the structure of formula (II): As specific product names, GP-1 as dibutyl lauroyl glutamide and EB-21 as dibutyl ethylhexanoyl glutamide (both manufactured by AJINOMOTO CO., INC.) etc., are mentioned. A glutamide compound “consisting essentially of” dibutyl ethylhexanoyl glutamide is intended to mean that the presence of additional glutamide compounds in amounts which would measurably affect the stability and/or viscosity of the fluid are excluded. The gellants used in the mascara composition may include either dibutyl lauryl glutamide or dibutyl ethylhexanoyl glutamide, in certain embodiments the composition may include dibutyl lauroyl glutamide, and in further embodiments the composition includes both dibutyl lauryl glutamide and dibutyl ethylhexanoyl glutamide. The gellants will typically be present in an amount sufficient to stabilize the emulsion composition or to structure the composition. The gellants will typically be present in an amount of greater than 0.5% to about 8.0% by weight, of the composition, or from about 1.0 to about 10.0% by weight, or in an amount of from about 0.75% to about 7.0% by weight, or in an amount from about 1.0% to about 6.0% by weight, or in an amount of from about 2.0% to about 5.0%, or in an amount of from about 2.0% to about 9.0% by weight, or from about 3.0% to about 7.0% by weight, or from about 4.0% to about 5.0% by weight. In specific embodiments, the compositions contain 0.7%, 0.8%, 0.9%, 1.0%, 1.25%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5%, 3.0%, 3.5%, 4.0%, 4.5%, 5.0%, 5.5%, 6.0%, 6.5%, and 7% of a glutamide gellant, a major portion of which is dibutyl lauroyl glutamide. “A major portion of which” in this context means that, in various embodiments, greater than 50% by weight of the glutamide gellant comprises dibutyl lauroyl glutamide, with the remainder being, preferably, dibutyl ethylhexanoyl glutamide.

The anhydrous vehicle will comprise up to 75% of the composition, typically about 10% to about 60%, usually about 20% to about 50%, and especially about 25% to about 40% by weight of the mascara composition The mascara compositions herein are particularly useful in providing an enhanced depth of a dark color to the eyelashes, especially, for example, a more pronounced black color to the eyelashes. The overall opacity of the cosmetic base of the mascara composition of the current invention is sufficiently low to permit the desired enhancement in the depth of color, i.e., to provide the deep dark color consumers prefer. In the L* a* b* color space (also known as CIELAB), L* indicates lightness and a* and b* are the color directions. L* is measured from 0 (black) to 100 (white). When the inventive formulations are dark or especially black, the black pigments in the formulations have increased light absorption and decreased light reflection, that is, a decreased L* value (i.e., a more intense black). In one embodiment, the mascara composition has a tristimulus L* value of less than 20. In other embodiments L* is15 or less, 12.5 or less, 10 or less, or 7.5 or less, as measured using a Konica Minolta CM-2600d Spectrophotometer. L* is measured by measuring L* values on a drawdown film (as hereinafter described) of mascara on a black Leneta card using a Konica Minolta CM-2600d hand-held spectrophotometer. The mascara compositions of the current invention may have a consistency of a liquid and/or viscous liquid. The hardness of the mascara may be measured by penetrating a probe into the composition. In particular, a texture analyzer (for example TA-XT2i from Rheo) equipped with a 2 mm needle probe may be used. The texture analyzer may be set to: Measurement Mode: Force in Compression; Test Speed: 1.0 mm/s; Distance: 5 mm; and Trigger Force: 5 g. Under these conditions it was determined that the mascara compositions of the current invention required a penetrating force of less than about 15 g and in other embodiments the penetrating force may be less than about 10 g. Additionally, the compositions of the current invention should exhibit a viscosity between about 250,000 centipoise and about 2,000,000 centipoise, in another embodiment between about 500,000 centipoise and about 1,750,000 centipoise; and about 750,000 centipoise and about 1,500,000 centipoise. The viscosity of the composition may be determined by using a Brookfield DV-E viscometer rotating at 4 rpms with a T-bar E spindle. In certain embodiments of the current invention, the mascara composition is substantially free of alkyl dimethicone. “Substantially free,” in this context means that there is less than about 1%, in some embodiments less than 0.5%, in further embodiments less than 0.05%, and in yet further embodiments 0% of alkyl dimethicone. In other embodiments, the compositions include alkyl dimethicone (e.g., stearyl dimethicone). In one embodiment, the amount of alkyl dimethicone (e.g., stearyl dimethicone) is between about 1% and about 5% by weight, or between about 1.5% and about 3.5% by weight. In another embodiment of the current invention, the mascaras of the current invention may further incorporate a low opacity wax component to enhance their volumizing capabilities. Waxes useful in the mascara of the present invention may include natural, mineral, or synthetic waxes exhibiting low opacity, i.e., a ΔL value of less than 8 as determined by the procedure set forth in Example 1 below. Waxes suitable for use in the current composition will exhibit a ΔL value that is less than 8 individually and/or in combination. In other embodiments the ΔL value of the waxes, singly or in combination, is 6 or less, or 4 or less, or 2 or less, or 1 or less. For clarity, in certain embodiments the wax component can be a combination of one or more individually waxes having a ΔL less than 8 with one or more waxes individually having a ΔL 8 or greater that in aggregate so long as the combination of waxes (i.e., the wax component) exhibits a ΔL less than 8. In one embodiment the wax component does not contain an individual wax having a ΔL value of 8 or greater. In other embodiments the wax component does not contain more than 15%, or more than 10%, or more than 5% of a wax whose ΔL value is 8 or greater by weight of the wax component. Suitable low opacity waxes include, but are not limited to, carnauba wax, beeswax, bleached beeswax, ozokerite, Kahlwax 7307, Silwax CRM2, Silwax 5022, low opacity variants and combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the low opacity wax comprises a silicone wax. In another embodiment, the low opacity wax consists predominantly of a silicone wax. In a further embodiment, the silicone wax comprises the major wax component of the composition. ΔL is measured by measuring L* values on a drawdown film of mascara on a black Leneta card using a hand-held spectrophotometer (e.g., a Konica Minolta CM-2600d spectrophotometer). The drawdown film is obtained by applying 3 mL of the sample (i.e., in the case of an emulsion, the non-aqueous phase or the gel base into which wax(es) or filler(s) have been incorporated, as the case may be, otherwise the cosmetic base or the cosmetic base into which wax(es) or filler(s) have been incorporated, as the case may be) to obtain a test film on the Leneta card that is about 75 microns in thickness and allowed to dry for 2 hours. The Leneta card itself is the standard for the color black in the tristimulus color measurement method, and by definition has an L value of zero. Thus, the ΔLgel base would be the L value associated with the gel base minus zero. As used herein the term “substantially transparent” as applied to the gel base means a ΔLgel base that is 10 or less. Preferably, this value is less than 10, typically less 7.5 or less, and especially between about 1 to 6, or between essentially zero to 6. The low opacity wax component and the low opacity filler component is provided in the cosmetic base (e.g., gel base) such that Lwax and/or filler minus Lgel base is less than 8, i.e, ΔL is less than 8, where Lwax and/or filler is the L value of the cosmetic (e.g., gel) base to which wax(es) and/or filler(s) have been incorporated. In particular, Applicants have determined wax components that impart the desire volume and lengthening to the mascara without adversely impacting the composition's greater depth of color. These waxes may be individually present in the combination of waxes in the following weight percentages: carnauba waxes may be present in about 1 to 40%, about 5 to 35%, about 10 to 30%, or about 15 to 25%; Kahlwax 7307 wax may be present in about 1 to 40%, about 5 to 35%, about 10 to 30%, or about 15 to 25%; beeswax may be present in about 1 to 30%, about 2.5 to 20%, about 5 to 15, or about 7.5 to 12.5%; Ozokerite wax may be present in about 0.1 to 15%, about 1 to 10%, or about 1.5 to 5%; and Silwax 5022 may be present in about 0.1-15%, about 1-10%, or about 1.5-5%. In a further embodiment, the wax component may be comprised of carnauba wax in about 1-20%, Kahlwax 7307 wax in about 1-10%, beeswax in about 1-10%; Ozokerite in about 1-10%, and Silwax in about 1-10%. The low opacity wax component may be present in the mascara of the current invention in an amount less than 25%. In other embodiments, the wax component is present in an amount of 1 to 20%, 2.5 to 15%, or 5 to 10% by weight of the mascara composition. In a particular embodiment, the compositions may contain 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, and 24.5% of the low opacity wax component. In an additional embodiment of the current invention, a polyamide resin may provide additional structural integrity to the gel base. Polyamide resins are high molecular weight polymers which feature amide linkages along the molecular chain. These polymers contain monomers of amides joined by peptide bonds. They can occur both naturally and artificially. Such polymers are made through step growth polymerization or solid phase synthesis. In some cases, examples of polyamide resins are nylons and aramids. Due to their extreme durability and strength, polyamide resins are typically utilized in textiles, plastics and various automotive applications. In the composition of the present invention the polyamide resin also provides a degree of gloss or shine to the composition and adhesion to the target substrate. While the polyamide resin Ethylenediamine Hydrogenated Dimer Dilinoleate Copolymer Bis-Di-C14-18 Alkyl Amide is currently preferred, the invention is not limited to this polyamide resin. One skilled in the art will be able to select suitable polyamide resins and many suitable polymers are disclosed in the CTFA Handbook, 12′h Ed. 2008, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. These include, without limitation, Polyamide-1, Polyamide-2, Polyamide-3, Ethylenediamine/Dimer Tallate Copolymer Bis-Hydrogenated Tallow Amide, Ethylenediamine/Stearyl Dimer Dilinoleate Copolymer, Ethylenediamine/Stearyl Dimer Tallate Copolymer, etc. A particular embodiment of the present disclosure is directed to a polyamide resin, or a combination of compatible polyamide resins, in an amount ranging from about 0.1% to about 25% by weight of the total composition, about 5% to about 20% by weight, and about 7% to about 15%. A particularly preferred polyamide resin is Ethylenediamine Hydrogenated Dimer Dilinoleate Copolymer Bis-Di-CI4-18 Alkyl Amide. In yet a further embodiment of the mascara compositions of the current invention, various low opacity fillers (the low opacity filler component) determined in accordance with the method denoted in Example 1 below, may be incorporated to enhance the dry time and volume of the composition. Fillers suitable for use in the current composition will exhibit a ΔL value that is less than 8 individually and/or in combination. In other embodiments the ΔL value of the fillers, singly or in combination, is 6 or less, or 4 or less, or 2 or less, or 1 or less. For clarity, in certain embodiments the filler component can be a combination of one or more individual fillers having a ΔL value of less than 8 with one or more waxes individually having a ΔL value of 8 or greater that in aggregate so long as the combination of fillers (i.e., the filler component) exhibits a ΔL value of less than 8. In one embodiment the filler component does not contain an individual filler having a ΔL value of 8 or greater. In other embodiments the filler component does not contain more than 15%, or more than 10%, or more than 5% of a filler whose ΔL value is 8 or greater, by weight of the filler component. Suitable fillers having a ΔL value of less than 8 may include, but are not limited to, barium sulfate (e.g., Blanc Fixe XR-HN from Sachtleben Chemie), sericite (e.g., Sericite PHN from Horie Kako), nylon powder, extra fine (e.g., Orgasol 2002 Exd Nat Cos from Arkema or Anbybes from SH Energy & Chemicals, talc Italian (e.g., Supra H USP from Luzenac America), solid glass microspheres (e.g., Prizmalite™ P2011 SL from Prizmalite Industries, Inc.), and combinations thereof. In particular, in certain embodiments solid glass microspheres may be used as inventors have noted that the use of the spheres provides enhanced depth of color and may provide a cumulative and/or synergistic enhancement in depth of color when used in conjunction with the inventive mascara of the current invention. The aggregate amount of the filler component is not particularly restricted. Typically, the filler component, if present, will collectively comprise from about 0.1% to about 10% of the total composition, about 0.5% to about 7% by weight of the composition, or about 1% to about 5% by weight of the composition. In certain embodiments the compositions will contain 0.75%, 1.0%, 2.0%, 3.0%, 4.0%, 5.0%, or 7.5% of the filler component. The mascara composition may also contain additional materials such as at least one film-forming agent. The film-forming polymer improves the wear of the composition, and can confer transfer-resistance to the make-up product. The film-forming agent may be any which is cosmetically acceptable for use around the eye. Examples include polymers such as polyethylene polymers, PVP, copolymers of PVP, ethylene vinyl acetate, dimethicone gum, C1-C6 alkyl(meth)acrylate polymer, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, cellulose polymers, and resins such as trimethylsiloxysilicate.

A representative hydrocarbon solvent is isododecane. The anhydrous vehicle may comprise one or more volatile and/or non-volatile silicone oils. Volatile silicones include cyclic and linear volatile dimethylsiloxane silicones. In one embodiment, the volatile silicones may include cyclodimethicones, including tetramer (D4), pentamer (D5), and hexamer (D6) cyclomethicones, or mixtures thereof.

Therefore, classifications herein are made for the sake of convenience and are not intended to limit an ingredient to the particularly stated application or applications listed. Needless to say, the composition of the invention should be cosmetically or dermatologically acceptable, i.e., it should contain a non-toxic physiologically acceptable medium and should be able to be applied to the eyelashes of human beings. For the purposes of the invention, the expression “cosmetically acceptable” means a composition of pleasant appearance, odor, feel and taste. A person skilled in the art will take care to select the optional additives and/or the amount thereof such that the advantageous properties of the composition according to the invention are not, or are not substantially, adversely affected by the envisaged addition. It is further understood that the other cosmetic ingredients and adjuvants introduced into the composition must be of a kind and quantity that are not detrimental to the advantageous effect which is sought herein according to the invention. The following examples describe specific aspects of the mascara of the present invention to illustrate the invention and provide a description for those skilled in the art. The Examples should not be construed as limiting the invention as the examples merely provide specific methodology useful in the understanding and practice of the invention and its various aspects. EXAMPLES Example 1 Opacity Test Method The opacity of fillers and waxes, and therefore their impact on the depth of color in a mascara composition of the current invention was determined as follows. A cosmetic base in accordance with the invention as set forth in Table 1 below was prepared for use as a negative control and used to determine the suitability of various waxes and fillers. TABLE 1 Cosmetic Base Dibutyl Ethylhexanoyl Glutamide 1.19% Dibutyl Lauroyl Glutamide 1.785% Ethylenediamine/Hydrogenated Dimer 19.05% Dilinoleate Alkyl Amide Octyldodecanol 77.975% Various gels incorporating waxes and fillers to be evaluated were prepared by replacing 10% of the octyldodecanol in the gelbase. Once prepared, each sample was drawn down (3 mL) on black Leneta cards and allowed to dry for 2 hours. Once dried, five L*, a*, b* readings were calculated per sample using a Konica Minolta CM-2600d spectrophotometer and the data averages were calculated. Any wax or filler having a ΔL, in the aggregate, greater than 8 was considered opaque and would interfere with the depth of color within the mascara of the current invention.
