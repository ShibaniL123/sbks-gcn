Step 3. 8-Chloro-6-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyrazine
To a solution of 3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazin-2-amine (2.32 g, 11.7 mmol) in EtOH (84 mL) was slowly added chloroacetaldehyde (37.3 mL, 294 mmol, 50% in H2O). The reaction mixture was portioned into seven 20-mL microwave vials, and then each was heated at 150Â° C. for 20 min in a microwave reactor. The reaction mixtures were combined and concentrated, the residue was diluted with DCM, and triethylamine was added cautiously to adjust pH7. Purification via silica gel chromatography (0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound as a brown oil (1.93 g, 74.2%). LCMS for C7H4ClF3N3 (M+H)+: calculated m/z=222.0; found 221.9.
