(5) Preparation of tert-butyl 8,11-dioxa-2-azadispiro[3.3.47.24]tridecane-2-carboxylate
In a high-pressure autoclave, 2-(2,4-dimethoxybenzyl)-8,11-dioxa-2-azadispiro[3.3.47.24]tridecane (4 g, 12.00 mmol), methanol (200 mL), Pd/C(10%, 800 mg), triethylamine (3.64 g, 35.97 mmol) and ditert-butyl dicarbonate (3.14 g, 14.39 mmol) were added, purged with hydrogen gas, reacted at 80Â°C overnight. The reaction solution was cooled, concentrated, and the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate : petroleum ether =1:10-1:5) to obtain the title compound as a white solid (2.1 g, yield 62%).
