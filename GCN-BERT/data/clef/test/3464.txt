Improved sweetener Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a low calorie sweetener composition having sweetness synergy. The present invention also relates to food or beverage products comprising said sweetener composition. Background of the Invention Many food and beverage products contain nutritive sweeteners such as sucrose (generally referred to as ‘sugar’ or ‘table sugar’), glucose, fructose, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup and the like. Such sweeteners supply not only sweetness to the food and beverage products, but also bulk, texture and desirable functional properties such as browning, humectancy, freezing point depression and the like. They also produce a favorable sensory response, for example in terms of quality of sweetness, lack of bitterness and off taste, desirable temporal profile and desirable mouthfeel. Although desirable in terms of taste and functional properties, excess intake of nutritive sweeteners, such as sucrose, has long been associated with an increase in diet-related health issues, such as obesity, heart disease, metabolic disorders and dental problems. This worrying trend has caused consumers to become increasingly aware of the importance of adopting a healthier lifestyle and reducing the level of nutritive sweeteners in their diet. In recent years, there has been a movement towards the development of replacements for nutritive sweeteners, with a particular focus on the development of low or zerocalorie sweeteners. An ideal replacement for a nutritive sweetener is a sweetener that has the same desirable taste characteristics and functional properties as the nutritive sweetener, but which also has fewer calories. Aiming to meet this growing need, the market has been flooded with possible candidates to replace conventional nutritive sweeteners. Unfortunately, however, many of the low or zero calorie replacements offered on the market lack one or all of the necessary characteristics, and often exhibit bitterness or off-taste. Therefore, many of the proposed sweeteners are not an ideal replacement for nutritive sweeteners. One proposed alternative to nutritive sweeteners is allulose (also known as D-psicose). Allulose is known as a “rare sugar”, since it occurs in nature in only very small amounts. It provides around 70% of the sweetness of sucrose, but only around 5% of the calories (approximately 0.2 kcal/g). It may therefore essentially be considered to be a ‘zero calorie’ sweetener. In view of its scarcity in nature, production of allulose relies on the epimerization of readily available fructose. Ketose-3-epimerases can interconvert fructose and allulose, and various ketose-3-epimerases are known for carrying out this conversion. US patent no. 8,030,035 and PCT publication no. WO2011/040708 disclose that Dpsicose (an alternative name for allulose) can be produced by reacting D-fructose with a protein derived from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, and having psicose 3-epimerase activity. US patent publication no. 2011/0275138 discloses a ketose 3-epimerase derived from a microorganism of the Rhizobium genus. This protein shows a high specificity to D- or L-ketopentose and D- or L-ketohexose, and especially to D-fructose and D-psicose. This document also discloses a process for producing ketoses by using the protein. Korean patent no. 100832339 discloses a Sinorhizobium YB-58 strain which is capable of converting fructose into psicose (i.e. allulose), and a method of producing psicose using a fungus body of the Sinorhizobium YB-58 strain. Korean patent application no. 1020090098938 discloses a method of producing psicose using Ε. coli wherein the Ε. coli expresses a polynucleotide encoding a psicose 3-epimerase. Allulose is present in processed cane and beet molasses, steam-treated coffee, wheat plant products and high fructose corn syrup. D-allulose is the C-3 epimer of D-fructose and the structural differences between allulose and fructose result in allulose not being metabolized by the human body to any significant extent, and thus having “zero" calories. Thus, allulose is thought to be a promising candidate as a replacement for nutritive sweeteners and as a sweet bulking agent, as it has no calories and is reported to be sweet while maintaining similar properties to sucrose. However, the use of allulose alone as a replacement for nutritive sweeteners may have some limitations due to cost and digestive tolerance in some applications. Alternative sweeteners on the market include sucralose and fructose. Sucralose is a ‘high potency’ or ‘high intensity’ sweetener that is approximately 600 times as sweet as sucrose. Fructose (also known as “fruit sugar”) is a 6-carbon polyhydroxyketone monosaccharide sugar that is often found in plants and in honey. The monosaccharide is found in crystalline form, often referred to as D-fructose. Fructose can also be found as a component of other sweeteners such as high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), which is a mixture of glucose and fructose. Fructose is frequently used to enhance the sweetness and taste of food and beverage products. Using fructose as a replacement for sucrose and other nutritive sweeteners also has its limitations, as fructose is fully caloric and thus does not provide an effective calorie reduction strategy. Therefore, there is a need to provide an improved replacement for nutritive sweeteners that has low calories and is without limitations in use, but which also has taste characteristics and functional properties similar to those of sucrose and other nutritive sweeteners. The present invention seeks to provide a solution to the above-mentioned problem by providing a sweetener composition having taste characteristics comparable to sucrose but having low calories. Advantageously, the present invention also seeks to provide a sweetener composition having sweetness synergy, a reduction in off-taste or off-flavor, a desirable temporal profile and improved mouthfeel, compared with proposed sweeteners currently available on the market.

Detailed description of the figures Figure 1: Graph illustrating the Mean SEV for allulose, fructose, sucralose and a composition comprising allulose, fructose and sucralose. Detailed description of the invention The present invention is based on the surprising finding that allulose, fructose and sucralose exhibit sweetness synergy, whereby the blend is sweeter than the expected sweetness based on the sweetness of its components. That is to say, the relative sweetness of the sweetener composition is greater than the sweetness calculated from the individual components of the composition. Furthermore, it has been found that this blend of allulose, fructose and sucralose addresses problems associated with the individual components, in particular, with regard to off-flavor and/or undesirable temporal profile. In addition, due to the presence of the zero calorie sweeteners, allulose and sucralose, the sweetener composition is low calorie. Furthermore, as a consequence of the sweetness synergy exhibited by the composition, the amount of the composition required to provide a given level of sweetness is less than would be expected in the absence of synergy, thereby allowing a further reduction in calories. Thus, the sweetener composition of the present invention provides enhanced sweetness, improves the balance of flavor by reducing off-taste or off-flavor, and provides a more desirable temporal profile, while at the same time allowing a significant reduction in calories compared to a sweet-equivalent amount of a conventional nutritive sweetener. Using the sweetener composition of the present invention allows delivery of an increased sweetness in food or beverage products when compared to the individual components used separately. This enhanced sweetness means that a smaller amount of sweetener can be used in these products, to provide a temporal and taste profile that closely matches that of sucrose. In general terms, the present invention relates to a sweetener composition comprising the sweeteners allulose, fructose and sucralose. The term “allulose” as used herein refers to a monosaccharide sugar of the structure shown as a Fischer projection in below Formula I. It is also known as “D-psicose”: CH2OH c^=o Η C OH Η C OH Η C OH Formula (I) CH2OH The term “fructose” as used herein refers to the monosaccharide sugar of the structure shown as a Fischer projection in below Formula II: CH2OH 0^=0 HO C Η Η C OH Η C OH Formula (II) CH2OH The term “sucralose” as used herein refers to sucralose of the structure shown in Formula III: The term “temporal profile” of a composition, sugar or sweetener, as used herein, is a measure of the perceived sweetness intensity of said composition, sugar or sweetener over time. A desirable or advantageous temporal profile is one wherein sweetness is observed quickly and has a short linger similar to that of sucrose. The term “sucrose equivalent value” or “SEV” as used herein refers to the sweetness equivalent of a sweetener related to the sweetness of sucrose. For example, a sweetener at an SEV value of 5 would have a sweetness similar to a 5% by weight solution of sucrose. The term “low calorie” as used herein refers to a sweetener having 40 calories or fewer per reference amount customarily consumed (RACC) and per labeled serving. All amounts given in % by weight are quoted on a dry solids (ds) basis unless specifically stated otherwise. Thus, where components are provided other than in their pure form, the amount added should be adjusted to provide the required amount on a dry solids basis. For example, where allulose is provided as a syrup, the amount of syrup used should be adjusted to supply the required amount of allulose on a dry solids basis.

Example Demonstration of sweetness synergy of the composition of the present invention Materials and Methods Round table evaluations were performed with test panelists. Equal sweet 10 SEV concentrations in neutral pH water were made for allulose, fructose and sucralose, as well as a composition comprising allulose, fructose and sucralose. The components of the test compositions are described in the below tables. The mixed compositions were calculated using the Beidler mixture equation for the sweeteners. The Beidler mixture equation for sweeteners is as follows: SEV = cone · cone +1 /Κ The concentration of each component in the mixture in ppm is divided by SEV (c/R) and is plotted against concentration, c. The slope of the linear regression is the maximum SEV (Rmax). The y-intercept of the linear regression multiplied by Rmax is the half-maximal sweetness concentration, 1/Κ. Rmax and 1/K are the two parameters used in the Beidler equation. The equal-molar mixture was tested against reference samples for the panelists to determine SEV values. References samples were 4%, 6%, 8%, 10%, 12%, and 14% sucrose in neutral pH water. The test samples were served in 2 ounce (approximately 60 ml) souffle cups coded with 3-digit codes at room temperature. A two minute wait period between samples was enforced. Water and unsalted crackers was available for the panelists to clear their palates before and during testing. EyeQuestion was used for ballot development and recording of results. Results were collected in EyeQuestion for calculating approximate SEV level of each test sample. The test products analyzed in this experiment are described below in Table 1.
