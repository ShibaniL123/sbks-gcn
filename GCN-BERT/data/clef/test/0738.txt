Title: Agricultural implement Description of invention This invention relates to an agricultural Implement and particularly, but not exclusively, to a rotary cultivator suitable for removing or reducing the quantity of stones present in topsoil. It is common practice to prepare soil beds before planting crops such as root vegetables or the like. Preparation of soil beds typically involves cultivating or tilling the sol! using a device such as a tractor-mounted rotary cultivator. Using a rotary cultivator stirs the top layer of sol! and in the process both removes weeds from the soil before a new crop is planted, and loosens and aerates the soil. In addition to loosening and aerating the soil when preparing a bed, it would be advantageous for stones to be removed from the bed, and for large clods of earth to be broken down into smaller particles. The presence of stones in soil can cause large clods of hardened soil to form, and may affect the absorption of infiltration of water into the soil. The presence of stones may also adversely affect machinery used when tending the soil, by clogging or damaging the machinery. Therefore, it is beneficial for the quantity of stones present in the topsoil to be reduced. According to a first aspect of the invention we provide an agricultural implement, including a support part, a rotor supported on and rotatable relative to the support part, the rotor including one or more blades, a grinding formation supported on the support part, and a filter part disposed between the rotor and the grinding formation, wherein during operation the rotor rotates about its longitudinal axis such that the forward-most, blade of the rotor moves upwardly. The grinding formation may comprise a plurality of grinding elements, each grinding element including an elongate rod and a plurality of grinding plates, the grinding plates being supported on and fixed for rotation with the rod. The plurality of grinding plates of each grinding element may be spaced evenly along the length of the rod. The grinding elements may be disposed parallel to one another. The separation distance between each pair of adjacent grinding plates of a grinding element may be greater than the width of each grinding plate, and for each pair of adjacent grinding elements, the grinding plates of a first of the pair of adjacent pairs of grinding elements may be positioned so as to overlap alternately with the grinding plates of the other of the pair of grinding elements. The support part may be adapted for attachment to a vehicle. Power may be transmitted to the rotor from the vehicle, to provide rotation of the rotor, and hydraulic power may be transmitted to the grinding elements from the vehicle, to provide rotation of the rod of each grinding element about its longitudinal axis. The filter part may Include a plurality of filter elements, each comprising at least one elongate finger. The filter elements may be supported on the support part such that they are disposed In a generally upright configuration; wherein the fingers are spaced apart from one another so as to form a grille. Each filter element may comprise an elongate metallic bar that is twisted at its midpoint through approximately 540 degrees so as to provide a resiiiently deformable structure comprising a sprung finger. The angle of the filter elements relative to the support part may be adjustable. The spacing of the f Iter elements relative to one another may be adjustable. The distance of separation between the filter part and grinding formation may be adjustable. The position of the grinding elements relative to the support part may be adjustable. The Implement may further include a roller that is supported on and rotatable relative to the support part, and which rotation is in a direction opposite to that of the rotor. Hydraulic power may be transmitted to the roller from the vehicle, to allow rotation of the roller about Its longitudinal axis, A breaking formation may be provided on the support part, the breaking formation including a bar which lies generally parallel and in dose proximity to the rotor. The implement may further include a bed-forming formation having a first and second edge-forming wall, and a smoothing plate, the bed-forming part being supported on the support part The invention will now be described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein: Figure 1 is a perspective view of the agricultural implement according to the invention, Figure 2 is a side view of the implement, and Figure 3 is a perspective view of a part of the implement. With reference to the drawings, the agricuiturai implement (0 is shown, which has a support part (indicated generally at 12), a rotor (indicated at 36} supported on the support part 12, a grinding formation 34 and a filter part 32, The support part 12 includes a pair of side walls 20 and a support surface 16 lying between the side wails 20. A connection formation (shown generally at 18) is provided on the support surface 16, to enable the implement to be connected to a vehicle such as a tractor. A rotor 36 is connected to the support part 12 at either end, each end being supported on a different side wall 20. The rotor 36 includes one or more blades extending generally outwardly from its central axis. A power connection (not shown) is provided on the implement, which in this example, in use is connected to a power take off provided on the vehicle to which it is attached. The rotor 36 is supported at either end by a different one of the side waiis 20, and driven by the power connection. During operation the implement 10 is towed by the vehicle to which it is connected by the connection formation 18, so that it moves in a direction as indicated at A in Figure 1, The rotor 36 rotates "against" the forward direction of the vehicle, so that the forward-most blades of the rotor (Le, those in closest proximity to the vehicle towing the implement 10) move upwardly, in use, where the implement is operated on a layer of soil in a field, the action of the rotor causes soil to be lifted on the blades of the rotor 36 and/or pushed away from the implement in the direction of travel (as indicated at A in Figure 1). Soil (including stones and other debris present in the soil) that is not lifted by the blades is instead pushed in front of the implement, and is subsequently either pushed down beneath the rotor as the implement passes over it, or else Is again contacted by a blade and lifted from the ground. This ensures that any soil or debris that is not lifted by the blade, and therefore is not processed by the implement, is buried below the layer of topsoil. A filter part 32 and grinding formation 34 are supported on the support part 12, such that the filter part 32 is disposed between the grinding formation 34 and the rotor 36, Soil and debris that is lifted by the blades of the rotor 36 is rotated towards the filter part 32. Large particles in the soli (such as large clods of soil or large stones) are prevented from passing through the filter part 32, and fall back onto the blades of the rotor 36, to be lifted again, A breaking bar (not shown) is disposed between the side walls 20 of the support part 12, and lies generally parallel and in close proximity to the rotor 36. As large particles are lifted by the rotor biades, they are brought into contact with the breaking bar, which in turn causes large clods of soil to be broken down into smaller particles, which are likely to be able to pass through the filter part 32, Large stones may not be broken down by the breaking bar, but are instead knocked back into the soil, to be pushed down into the ground as the rotor passes over them. The filter part 32, as is shown in Figure 3, tnciudes a plurality of filter elements, each comprising an elongate metallic bar that is twisted at its midpoint through approximately 540 degrees so as to provide a resiliency deformable structure comprising a sprung finger. The fingers typically have a diameter of approximately 12mm, and are held in a generally upright position and are spaced apart from one another, so as to form a grille. Preferably, the spacing between filter elements is 28 to 35mm, and this may be adjusted to alter the sire of particles able to pass through the filter part and into the grinding formation '34 The angle of the filter elements relative to the support part 12 is adjustable. The angle may be adjusted, for example where the Implement operates in areas with a high concentration of stones present in the soil, so that the filter elements extend downwardly away from the direction of motion of the implement, so that large particles or stones that do not pass between the filter elements are directed back towards the rotor. These large particles, which have not passed into the grinding formation 34, fall down to the ground between the rotor 36 and a powered roller comprising a square shaft 38. The roller 38 is driven by a hydraulic connection, provided from the vehicle, and acts to push these large particles and stones down into the ground, so that they do not form a part of the topsoil prepared by the implement The direction of rotation of the roller 38 is in a direction opposite to that of the rotor 36. The distance of separation between the filter part 32 and grinding formation 34 is adjustable by moving the filter part towards or away from the rotor 36, or by moving the grinding formation away from the filter part. The grinding 34 formation includes a plurality of grinding elements 34a~34c, each grinding element including an elongate rod and a plurality of- grinding plates, the grinding plates being supported on and fixed for rotation with the rod The grinding plates of each grinding element 34a~34c are spaced approximately evenly along the length of the rod, and the rods of the respective grinding elements are supported between the walls 2(5 of the support part 12, such that they lie across the width of the implement, and are disposed generally parallel to one another. The separation distance between each pair of adjacent grinding plates of a grinding element is greater than the width of each grinding plate. The grinding plates of the first grinding element 34a are positioned so as to overlap alternately with the grinding plates of the second grinding element 34b, and the grinding plates of the second grinding element 34b are positioned so that they overlap alternately with the grinding plates of the third grinding element 34c. Whilst the current embodiment of the invention includes three rows of grinding elements, it should be understood that any number of grinding elements could be provided. The grinding plates are generally "star-shaped'’ in cross-section (viewing the plates along the longitudinal axis of the rod of the grinding element). Each grinding plate has a plurality of arms which extend outwardly from the centre of the plate, the tip of each of the arms being circumferentially-displaced in a common direction, so that each arm is curved. The concave faces of the uppermost arms face away from the filter part 32 in a direction opposite to that of the movement of the implement {Le. in the opposite direction to A). The rods and connected grinding plates rotate such that the concave face of each arm is the leading face of rotation. In other words, each grinding element rotates in an anti-clockwise direction as viewed in Figure 2, the grinding plates of each grinding element 34a-34c being attached to the respective rod of that grinding element rod, and the rod being hydraulically driven to enable its rotation. The rotational drive may be supplied to each rod through a chaindriven connection with the rotor 36. The grinding elements 34a - 34c and square shaft 38 all rotate in the same direction and have a common drive, In use, as soil and debris is passed through the filter part 32, it comes into contact with the grinding formation 34. Large clods of soli and stones cannot pass between the fingers of the filter elements, and therefore cannot reach the grinding formation 34. Smaller clods of soil, and stones, are conveyed by the rotation of the grinding elements, so that particles are moved between the first 34a and second 34b, and then between the second 34b and third 34c grinding elements. As the grinding plates rotate on their respective rods, particles which are larger in diameter than the width of a grinding plate are broken down into smaller particles by the relative movements in opposite directions of the arms of plates of alternate grinding elements. As the arms of the plates on the first grinding elements 34a are moving downwardly, the overlapping arms of the second grinding element 34b move upwardly, Particles that He wholly within the width of the first plate 34a are rotated until they fail down below' the grinding formation 34, to lie on the ground beneath the implement and form a layer of topsoil Particles larger than the width of the grinding plate are contacted by the rotating plates of the second grinding element 34b, and lifted upward with the rotating plates towards the third grinding element 34c where the same process is repeated. Of course, not all particles passing through the filter part 32 come Into contact with the first grinding element 34a, Some particles may be thrown by the motion of the rotor 36 such that they land on another part of the grinding formation. These particles then pass through the grinding formation In a similar way to that described above, it: is possible for srrpll stones to enter the grinding formation 34, and these may become lodgej/ between the grinding elements. The ends of the rods of each grinding element are held in a spring-loaded formation so as to allow a degree of movement in the position of the end of the rod in relation to the wall 20 of the support part 12. This freedom of movement allows the rods of the grinding elements to move relative to one another, to allow stones to pass between the grinding plates of the respective grinding elements, to avoid a jam occurring in the grinding formation 34. As soii passes over, or through, the grinding formation, the soli fails to the ground beiow the implement 10. As the implement continues to move forward, in the direction indicated at A in Figure 1, the soil deposited below the implement comes into contact with a bed-forming formation (shown generally at 22). The bed-forming formation includes a first and second edge-forming wali 26, and a smoothing plate 24, and is supported on the support part 12. The angle and position of the smoothing plate 24 relative to the support part 12 is adjustable. By lowering the smoothing plate 24, the level of topsoil is lowered, as the smoothing plate 24 pushes against excess soil that is piled high beneath the implement, to create a smooth top layer of soil as the machine passes the soil. The edge-forming walls 26 keep the soil within a boundary defined by the width of the space between the walls, shaping the processed topsoil into a bed of predefined width. Typically a topsoil bed is created with a width of 1.8m. The embodiments shown in the present drawings comprises an implement operable to prepare a single bed, but it may be desirable in terms of improved efficiency or reduced operating time to provide an implement able to prepare a wide bed or multiple beds simultaneously. GB2378632 describes a three-bed tilling implement, wherein in use two parts are aligned end-to-end so as to form an extended tilling device, and when not in use the outer parts are moveable to an upright position so that the width of the implement is reduced. It would he apparent to a skilled reader that the general structure of the three-bed tilling apparatus could be used to support the implement of the current invention. Alternatively, a three-bed apparatus may be provided where two implements are provided as supported on either side of a frame for attaching to a tractor, and a third implement is supported rearwardiy of the frame and the first two implements. In this way each bed is prepared by a separate implement 10 as described herein, The features of the invention may be applied to other forms of known agricultural vehicle or implement, such as the three-bed tilling implement described in patent GB2378532. 1.
