No. 14/152,236, filed on Jan. 10, 2014, and now for which the benefit is claimed under 35 U.S.C §120; the content of each of the abovementioned patent application is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety and made a part of this specification. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention features an isolated Lactobacillus strain and its use for controlling body weight. 2. Description of the Prior Art With the development of cities, obesity has gradually become the health killer in modern life nowadays. Accumulated studies also indicate obesity increases the risk of developing diabetes, cancers, gall bladder diseases, high blood pressure as well as atherosclerosis, and therefore effectively reducing body fat and decreasing obesity are urgent tasks. Obesity is usually caused by excess body fat accumulated in the body due to physiological or biochemical functional change(s) and can have adversely affected the health. Lipids commonly include fats, phospholipid and cholesterol. The increase of weight is mainly due to the fact that total energy intake is more than energy expenditure. In general, obesity can be divided into two types including simple obesity and second obesity. Simple obesity can be further classified as idiopathic obesity and acquired obesity and account for nearly 95% of obesity. Idiopathic obesity is caused by huge numbers of adipocytes and is usually found in children obesity. Meanwhile, acquired obesity results from larger adipocytes and is more common in adults with obesity problems. Second obesity is also called symptomatic obesity and is often the result of endocrine or metabolic diseases. Obesity has been found to correlate with certain chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, biliary calculus, gout and certain cancers. Currently, five strategies are available for treating obesity: diet, exercise, behavioral therapy, drug therapy and therapeutic operation. Different treatment or combinations of these treatments are selected for treating patients with obesity based on the risk factors in the patient's health, the rate of weight loss as well as the corresponding effects of those treatments. The rate of weight loss and the effects are determined according to various factors such as age, height, family history and risk factors, etc. The mechanisms of drug therapy include appetite, increase energy consumption, stimulate lipid transfer, reduce triacylglycerol synthesis and inhibition of lipid adsorption. The common drugs used clinically for treatment are phenylpropanolamine (PPA), orlistat/Xenical™, and sibutramine/Reductil™. Nonetheless, treating obesity with natural materials instead of using drugs has become the new trend recently. Probiotics is beneficial to the health of gastrointestinal tract, and several reports have indicated that in addition to regulating immune functions, these bacteria can also help ameliorate disease symptoms such as high blood pressure, cancers and high cholesterol. Moreover, studies have demonstrated certain probiotic bacteria can regulate the body weight and body fat of obese mice, regardless of the status of these bacteria, live or dead. From prior research, it is speculated that probiotics may contain crucial effective ingredient(s). In prior application, U.S. Pat. No. 8,298,526, the inventor of present invention discovered Lactobacillus reuteri GMNL-263 can effectively improve the symptoms of type I diabetes. However, whether probiotics can efficiently improve obesity symptoms or reduce weight and through which mechanism(s) remain unclear due to the limited literature available up to date. In previous examination, the examiner mentioned that the result of instant case was inherently achieved by US20120183504 and U.S. Pat. No. 8,298,526 given that the identical composition was administered and would necessarily achieved the same result, given that it was the identical composition. In the present continuation-in-part, the applicant provided new matters demonstrating the efficiency of lowering weight and fat is better treating with dead bacteria than live bacteria if the dosage is the same. Moreover, according to the examples, the effect can be achieved with the dosage between 5×105 and 2×1010 cells/ml (dead bacteria). Compare to the references, U.S. Pat. No. 8,298,526 discloses the effect of live bacteria 2×1010 cfu/day for improving diabetes, and US20120183504 discloses the effect of bacteria 109 organism/rat/day for improving renal fibrosis (US20120183504 mentions that the bacteria can be treated live or inactive; however, there are no comparison between the effect of live bacteria and live bacteria in the example, and the example only provides the effect of treating live bacteria). After the restriction in the instant case, the claims were restricted to dead bacteria and dosage of bacteria. Neither U.S. Pat. No. 8,298,526 nor US20120183504 disclosed the novel effect of lowering weight and fat by administrating dead bacteria and its dosage as disclosed in the instant case. In addition, in US20120183504 the body weight of rats of normal group did not decrease after administrating bacteria (US20120183504 FIG. 1, 2); on the contrary, in the instant case the body weight of rats of normal group significantly lowered down after administrating dead bacteria (FIG. 2A). This suggests the mechanism and effect are different between the instant case and US20120183504. Therefore, the different result implies that the effect of the instant invention is distinct from US20120183504 and the instant case should be considered as a novel invention that requires laborious experimentation to acquire unexpected results. In view of the above, one of ordinary skills in the art would not be able to practice the current application by the teachings of the prior art.

Example 1 Materials: 3T3-Llpreadipocytes (BCRC 60159 purchased from Food Industry Research and Development Institute), DMEM-high glucose and MRS broth. Methods: The technique utilized herein is modified from which disclosed in the previous study of Park et. al. (2011). a. Preparation of Lactobacillus Bacterial Cell Lysate: 1. Bacterial strains were obtained from the culture collection and incubated in MRS broth for 18 hrs.2. The bacterial cultures were centrifuged at2,700 rpm for 10 minutes, washed with PBS and the broth was discarded for collection of the bacterial strains without medium.3. The collected bacteria were re-suspended with PBS and adjusted to the concentration of 1×1010 cell/ml. The adjusted bacterial culture was subjected to sonication for lysis and then filtered with a 0.22 μm filter membrane before stored at −20° C. b. In Vitro Cell Culture of 3T3-L1 Cells: 1. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were cultured in DMEM-high glucose medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (PS) and the medium was changed every 2-3 days when sub-culturing the cells.2. The cells were inoculated onto 24-well plates at the concentration of 8×104 cells/well and confluent growth shall be obtained after 3-day culture. The medium was then replaced and the cells were cultured for additional two days.3. The medium was then replaced with DMEM-high glucose containing 10% FBS, 10 μg/mL insulin, 0.5 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 1 μM dexamethasone, and the cells were cultured for additional three days.4. At the end of 3-day culture, the medium was replaced with DMEM-high glucose containing 10% FBS, 1% PS and 10 μg/mL insulin, and then changed every two days. Nearly 90% of the cells have differentiated into mature adipocytes after 14 days of culture. c. Protein quantification analysis: 1. Following removal of culture medium, the cells were washed three times with PBS.2. Trypsin was added to dislodge the cells from culture plates and the cells were collected in the tube using PBS.3. Centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 5 minutes, the supernatant was discarded and lysis buffer was added to lyse the cells.4. Centrifugation at14,000 rpm for 10 minutes and the resulting supernatant was used as test sample. Bio-Rad Protein assay buffer was diluted 5 fold first and an aliquot of 900 μl diluted assay buffer was mixed homogenously with 100 μl supernatant or standard solution BSA and incubated for 5 minutes.5. Protein concentration was measured at A595. Oil Red O staining for measuring intracellular lipid droplets: Oil Red O is an oil soluble dye which stains lipids in cytoplasm in red. 1. Remove the medium, and wash the cells three times with PBS.2. Add 200 μl methanol and incubate for 1 hour to fix the cells.3. Prepare oil red O working solution from oil red O stock solution, and add 2000 oil red O working solution to the washed cells and stain for 1 hr.4. Remove the dye and wash the cells 3 times with de-ionized water followed by removal of excess water.5. Observe and acquire the images of the cells under the microscope for analysis.6. Add 500 μl isopropanol and incubate overnight to dissolve the dye and measure OD at 492 nm. The oil amount of each cell is determined by dividing the measured oil amount with protein amount Test Results Lr263 cell lysate is prepared by sonication of the cells in PBS at the concentration of1×1010 cells/ml and the obtained lysates were then added to 3T3-L1 preadipocytes at various concentrations as treatments and the effect(s) of the cell lysates on lipid cell differentiation were subsequently examined. After being cultured for 22 days, adipocytes were stained with Oil Red O and oil droplets were clearly visible under the microscope (red areas). From FIG. 1A, increase of the concentration of Lr263 cell lysates decreases the stained areas of red oil droplets. The levels of oil droplets as well as inhibition of lipid biosynthesis after addition of 0.05 and 0.5% Lr263 cell lysates to fat cells were 68.5±16.0%/32.1±5.6% and 30%/70%, respectively, whereas treating the cells with the highest concentration of cell lysates at 5% only inhibits about 90% of lipid biosynthesis and the level of lipids is 13.4±1.6%(FIG. 1B). In summary, Lr263 cell lysates can effectively inhibit formation of oil droplets during the process of adipocyte differentiation; in other words, it can inhibit biosynthesis of lipid. Therefore, according to the results obtained from in vitro studies, Lr263 is a Lactobacillus strain which has the anti-obesity potential. Example 2 Experimental procedures: The rats were fed with high fat feeds and Lactobacillus bacteria from day 1 and were sacrificed after 12 weeks of feeding. During the course of the experiment, water as well as food intake were recorded every day, body weight and fasting blood glucose were documented every week, and oral glucose tolerance was examined every four weeks. Preparation of the dead Lactobacillus bacteria: Lactobacillus Reuteri Lr263 bacteria were cultured in MRS broth in the 37° C. incubator for 12 hours followed by washing twice with PBS and then incubated in water bath at 100° C. for another 20 minutes before cryoprotectant was added. The Lr263 bacterial culture was freeze-dried into powder using a freeze dryer. Detailed diet formulations of normal as well as high fat diets are described as follows: TABLE 3 Diet formulations Normal Diet High Fat Diet Ingredient (g/kg) group (HFD) group Casein 200 232 L-Cystine 3.0 3.0 DL-Methionine — 3.5 Corn Starch 397.48 137 Maltodextrin 132 150 Sucrose 100 162.58 Cellulose 50 50 Cholesterol — 1.9 Mineral Mix (AIN-93) 35 40.60 Calcium phosphate dibasic — 4.64 Vitamin Mix (AIN-93) 10 16.24 Choline Bitartrate 2.5 5 tert-butylhydroquinone 0.014 0.04 Soybean oil 70 40 Lard — 153.5 Animal study: Male SD (Sprague-Dawley) rats at the age of five weeks old were purchased from BioLASCO Taiwan Co., Ltd. (Taipei, Taiwan). Throughout the experiment, the rats were housed in air-conditioned and temperature-adjusted plastic cages with a 12-h light/dark cycle and room temperature at 25±1° C. and have free access to water and food. The rats, based on their body weights, were randomly assigned to one of the eight groups as shown below after a week of adjustments. 1. Normal diet group: Fed with normal diet and 1 mlRO water everyday2. Normal diet+Lr263 dead bacteria group: Fed with normal diet andLr263 bacteria (5×109 cells/rat/per day) everyday3. High fat diet (HFD)(negative control) group: Fed with HFD and lml RO water per day everyday4. HFD+Shirota dead bacteria (positive control) group: Fed with normal diet and Shirota bacteria (5×109 cells/rat/per day) every day. Professor Minoru Shirota, a microbiologist at the Department of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan, successfully identified the lactic acid bacteria which is beneficial to human's gastrointestinal tract in 1930's and the strain was named Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota which is used as the positive control group in this application.5. HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria low dose group: Fed with HFD and dead Lr263 bacteria (5×105 cells/rat/per day) everyday6. HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria medium dose group: Fed with HFD and dead Lr263 bacteria (5×107 cells/rat/per day) everyday7. HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria high dose group: Fed with HFD and dead Lr263 bacteria (5×109 cells/rat/per day) everyday8. HFD+Lr263 live bacteria group: Fed with HFD and Lr263 live bacteria (2×109 cells/rat/per day) everyday Statistical analyses: Data collected was analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS to determine the differences among these experimental groups. Where significant difference was observed (P<0.01), the data was subjected to Duncan's new multiple range test for further analysis. Test Results: A. The Effect of Lr263 dead Bacteria on Body Weight: Following feeding with different diets/treatments, at the end of week 12, only the body weight of the rats in the positive control HFD+Shirota group showed reduction; however, the decrease was not significant. On the contrary, rats fed with HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria low dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria medium dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria high dose and HFD+Lr263 live bacteria all demonstrated significant weight loss when compared with HFD group (FIG. 2A-B and Table 4). Moreover, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria medium dose treatment has even better effect on lowering body weight than HFD+Lr263 live bacteria treatment, indicating both live and dead Lr263 bacteria are effective in treating obesity and reducing body weight. B. the Effect of Lr263 Bacteria on Total Adipose Tissues/Body Weight Ratio: Following feeding with different diets/treatments, at the end of week 12, the adipose tissue/body weight ratios of HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria medium dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria high dose and HFD+Lr263 live bacteria groups were all significantly lower than that of the HFD group (FIG. 3). In addition, the adipose tissue/body weight ratios of the rats fed with Lr263 dead bacteria had declined over the time, and the reduction rate of HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria low dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria medium dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria high dose groups were 21.6%, 24.8% and 31.0%, respectively, when compared with the HFD group. C. The Effect of Lr263 Bacteria on Visceral Fat/Body Weight Ratio: Based on the abovementioned results of total adipose tissue/body weight ratios, the change of visceral fat was further examined at week 12. Similarly, the visceral fat/body weight ratios of HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria medium dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria high dose and HFD+Lr263 live bacteria groups were significantly lower than that of the HFD group (FIG. 4). Also, the visceral fat/body weight ratios of the rats fed with dead Lr263 bacteria had declined over the time, and the reduction rates of HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria low dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria medium dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria high dose groups were 20.9%, 23.2% and 31%, respectively, when compared with the HFD group. D. the Effect of Lr263 Bacteria on Gonadal Fat/Body Weight Ratio: According to the abovementioned results of total adipose tissue/body weight ratios, the change of gonadal fat was further investigated at week 12. Likewise, the gonadal fat/body weight ratios of HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria medium dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria high dose and HFD+Lr263 live bacteria groups were significantly lower than that of the HFD group (FIG. 5), and the gonadal fat/body weight ratios of the rats fed with dead Lr263 bacteria had declined over the time and the reduction rates of HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria low dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria medium dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria high dose groups were 10.0%, 31.8% and 33.7%, respectively, when compared with the HFD group. E. the Effect of Lr263 Bacteria on Liver Function: Following feeding with different diets/treatments, serum AST (U/L) and ALT (U/L) each group was examined at the end of week 12. According to the results, serum AST levels were significantly lower in the HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria low dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria high dose and HFD+Lr263 live bacteria groups than that of the HFD group (FIG. 6), whereas no significance was found in the HFD+Shirota group when compared with the HFD group. Furthermore, serum ALT levels are significantly lower in the groups of HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria low dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria medium dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria high dose and HFD+Lr263 live bacteria than that of the HFD group (FIG. 6), whereas no significance was found in the HFD+Shirota group when compared with the HFD group. Unpredictably, dead Lr263 bacteria at low dose (5×105 cells/rat/per day) can effectively lower serum AST as well as ALT levels and exert the same effects as obtained from the group fed with high dose of live Lr263 bacteria (2×109 cells/rat/per day) and the results are even comparable to those observed in normal diet group. F. the Effect of Lr263 bacteria on Blood Lipid Levels: Following feeding with different diets/treatments, the serum T-CHO (mg/dL) and TG (mg/dL) levels of each group were examined at the end of week 12. From the results, the concentrations of total cholesterol detected in the groups of HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria low dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria medium dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria high dose and HFD+Lr263 live bacteria were all significantly lower than that of the HFD group (FIG. 7). Likewise, triglyceride levels were also significantly lower in the HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria low dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria medium dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria high dose and HFD+Lr263 live bacteria groups when compared with the HFD group (FIG. 7). Unexpectedly, dead Lr263 bacteria at low dose (5×105 cell//rat/per day) can exert effects similar to those obtained from the group fed with normal diet. G. the Effect of Lr263 Bacteria on LDL/HDL Ratios: Following feeding with different diets/treatments, the LDL/HDL ratio of each group was measured at the end of week 12. According to the results, the LDL/HDL ratios were significantly lower in the groups of HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria low dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria medium dose, HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria high dose and HFD+Lr263 live bacteria than that of the HFD group (FIG. 8), whereas no significance was found in the HFD+Shirota group when compared with the HFD group. Surprisingly, we found that feeding with low dose of dead Lr263 bacteria (5×105 cells//rat/per day) has almost the same effect as feeding with normal diet and the LDL/HDL ratio decreased more significantly with the increase of the bacterial dosage. Example 3 Following the previously described experiment, since the effect of losing weight can be achieved through both live bacteria and dead, the efficiency between live bacteria and dead bacteria is to be compared by the following experiment. In the instant example, the materials and methods is identical to the experiment presented in example 2 except the feature below: Animal study: Male SD (Sprague-Dawley) rats at the age of five weeks old were purchased from BioLASCO Taiwan Co., Ltd. (Taipei, Taiwan). Throughout the experiment, the rats were housed in air-conditioned and temperature-adjusted plastic cages with a 12-h light/dark cycle and room temperature at 25±1° C. and have free access to water and food. The rats, based on their body weights, were randomly assigned to one of the 4 groups as shown below after a week of adjustments. 1. Normal diet group: Fed with normal diet and 1 ml RO water everyday2. High fat diet (HFD)(negative control) group: Fed with HFD and 1 ml RO water per day everyday3. HFD+Lr263 dead bacteria group: Fed with HFD and Lr263 bacteria (2×109 cells/rat/per day) everyday4. HFD+Lr263 live bacteria group: Fed with HFD and dead Lr263 bacteria (2×109 cells/rat/per day) everyday Data were collected and analyzed by standardizing by HFD rat body weight and body fat. The results are presented in Table. 6, 7. After 8 weeks experiment, the body weight and body fat of HFD rats were increased compared to normal diet group (p<0.05). In contrast, the body weight and body fat of the rats which were fed with live or dead bacteria Lr263 significantly decrease compared to HFD group (p<0.05). Moreover, the efficiency of lowering weight and fat is better treating with dead bacteria than live bacteria. Many changes and modifications in the above described embodiment of the invention can, of course, be carried out without departing from the scope thereof. Accordingly, to promote the progress in science and the useful arts, the invention is disclosed and is intended to be limited only by the scope of the appended claims.
