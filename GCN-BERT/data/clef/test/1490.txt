SUBSTITUTED AROMATIC COMPOUNDS FOR THE TREATMENT OF PULMONARY FIBROSIS, LIVER FIBROSIS, SKIN FIBROSIS AND CARDIAC FIBROSIS FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to substituted aromatic compounds, their preparation, compositions comprising the same and their use for prevention or treatment of various fibrotic diseases and conditions in subjects, including pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis, skin fibrosis and cardiac fibrosis. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Pulmonary fibrosis Lung fibrosis, also referred to as pulmonary fibrosis, is a serious medical condition that involves scarring of the lung tissue. This condition occurs when the alveoli and interstitial tissue of the lungs become inflamed and develop scars on the tissue in an attempt to repair themselves. Pulmonary fibrosis involves gradual exchange of normal lung parenchyma with fibrotic tissue (fibrous scar). The replacement of normal lung with scar tissue causes irreversible decrease in oxygen diffusion capacity. Currently, there is no cure or means by which to reverse this scarring of the lung tissue. Pulmonary fibrosis can be caused by many conditions which includes chronic inflammatory processes (sarcoidosis, Wegener's granulomatosis), infections, environmental agents (asbestos, silica, exposure to certain gases), exposure to ionizing radiation (such as radiation therapy to treat tumors of the chest), chronic conditions (lupus), and certain medications (e.g. amiodarone, bleomycin, pingyangmycin, busulfan, methotrexate, and nitrofurantoin). In a condition known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, fibrosis of the lung can develop following a heightened immune reaction to inhaled organic dusts or occupational chemicals. This condition most often results from inhaling dust contaminated with bacterial, fungal, or animal products. COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is another form of lung fibrosis (Gosker et al. (2003) “Myopathological features in skeletal muscle of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease” Eur. Respir. J. 22(2), 280-285) that is caused by smoke irritation of the lung tissue. Tobacco smoking is the most common cause of COPD, with a number of other factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role. In the developing world, one of the common sources of air pollution is from poorly vented cooking and heating fires. Long-term exposure to these irritants causes an inflammatory response in the lungs resulting in narrowing of the small airways and breakdown of lung tissue known as emphysema. The diagnosis is based on poor airflow as measured by lung function tests. In contrast to asthma, the airflow reduction does not improve significantly with the administration of currently approved medications. COPD can be prevented by reducing exposure to the known causes. This includes efforts to decrease rates of smoking and to improve indoor and outdoor air quality. COPD treatments include: quitting smoking, vaccinations, rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation. In those who have periods of acute worsening, increased use of medications and hospitalization may be needed. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is also another form of lung fibrosis. CF is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that affects most critically the lungs, and also the pancreas, liver, and intestine. It is characterized by abnormal transport of chloride and sodium across an epithelium, leading to thick, viscous secretions. The name cystic fibrosis refers to the characteristic scarring (fibrosis) and cyst formation within the pancreas, first recognized in the 1930s. Difficulty breathing is the most serious symptom and results from frequent lung infections that are treated with antibiotics and other medications. Other symptoms (including sinus infections, poor growth, and infertility) affect other parts of the body. CF is caused by a mutation in the gene for the protein cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). This protein is required to regulate the components of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus. CFTR regulates the movement of chloride and sodium ions across epithelial membranes, such as the alveolar epithelia located in the lungs. Most people without CF have two working copies of the CFTR gene, and both copies must be missing for CF to develop, due to the disorder's recessive nature. CF develops when neither copy works normally (as a result of mutation) and therefore has autosomal recessive inheritance. Studies in mast cells in cystic fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, diseases that have peripheral lung fibrosis as a significant pathological feature (Andersson et. al. (2011) “Activated MC(TC) mast cells infiltrate diseased lung areas in cystic fibrosis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis” Respiratory Research 12(1), 139). Although CF and IPF have different etiologies, the basic pathological features of the fibrotic lesions include excessive collagen deposition. In some subjects, chronic pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis develop without an identifiable cause. Most of these subjects have a condition called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). IPF is a chronic progressive pulmonary fibrosis of unknown etiology. Prednisone is the usual treatment for IPF but it can be treated with other immunosuppressive therapies with the objective of reduction of inflammation that is the prelude to lung fibrosis. Although prednisone has a modest measurable effect on improving lung function, the scarce evidence for its long-term efficacy, as well as concerns regarding its safety, limits its use. Indeed most immunosuppressive drugs have little therapeutic effects and lung transplantation may be necessary. Unfortunately, transplants are of limited success in patients with end-stage long disease and median survival time with patients is four to six years after diagnosis. As such, there is need for novel yet efficacious treatment for IPF. Some clinical trials are ongoing with candidate drugs that specifically address the inhibition or slowing down of fibrosis in the lungs such as IFN-y and mycophenolate mofetil. Further examples include: pirfenidone which mechanism of action is not well defined but seems to reduce CTGF and has shown some results in clinical phase; substituted biphenyl carboxylic acids which function as lysophosphatidic acid receptor antagonists and display significant antifibrotic activity in the standard pulmonary fibrosis mouse model (bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis). As such, this compound is reported to be in clinical trials for the treatment of IPF. Inhibition of protein kinase enzymes with orally active candidate drugs or treatment with orally active antioxidants provide two treatment approaches for pulmonary fibrosis: multiple kinase inhibitors (such as nintedanib) and JNK (kinase) inhibitors (such as tanzisertib). Also, drug candidates for IPF includes antioxidant N-acetylcysteine. However, to date the progress of protein kinase inhibitors and antioxidants have been questionable for the treatment of IPF due to issues of toxicity and/or efficacy. Protein kinase enzymes and associated receptors are ubiquitous amongst normal and diseased cell populations and so inhibition may result in toxicity arising in particular amongst rapidly proliferating cell populations. Additionally, clinical trials are in progress with monoclonal antibodies that target different profibrotic proteins (cytokines (CTGF, TGF-p, MCP-1, IL-4 and IL-13), integrins (ανβ6) and enzymes (LOXL2 enzyme) for the treatment of IPF. However, a number of issues are associated with the development and use of monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of IPF (which apply to other recombinant proteins) which include toxicity (including protein immunogenicity), difficulty of manufacture (batch consistency, scale-up, expense) and administration (need for refrigeration, not orally active). Furthermore, though research trials are ongoing, there is no evidence that any medications can significantly help this condition. Lung transplantation is the only therapeutic option available in severe cases. Unfortunately, transplants are of limited success in patients with end-stage lung disease. As such, there is a need for novel yet efficacious treatments for IPF. Therefore, there is a need for novel yet conveniently administered (orally active) efficacious synthetic (readily manufactured) compounds. Liver fibrosis Liver fibrosis or hepatic fibrosis is the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins (including collagen), and subsequent scarring process, that occurs in most chronic liver diseases. With time, advanced liver fibrosis results in cirrhosis of the liver. Cirrhosis is the final phase of the chronic liver disease and is generally irreversible with a poor long-term prognosis. In the advanced stage, the only option is the liver transplant. The risk of liver cancer is significant increased with cirrhosis and cirrhosis may be viewed as a premalignant condition (hepatocellular carcinoma). Indeed, cirrhosis and liver cancer are among the ten causes of death worldwide. As such, there is a need for novel yet efficacious treatment for liver fibrosis and subsequent cirrhosis of the liver. Unfortunately, few treatment options are available and most often treatment consists of addressing the causes and/or symptoms of liver cirrhosis. No treatment will cure liver fibrosis subsequent scarring and cirrhosis. Liver transplantation is the only treatment available for patients with advanced stage of fibrosis. Therefore, alternative methods that would be less intrusive are needed to cure, treat, slow the progression of, or prevent liver fibrosis. Accumulation of fluid in the abdomen (ascites) is a common problem associated with liver cirrhosis. Treatment options include a low sodium diet, diuretics and removal of fluid by insertion of a needle into the abdominal cavity (paracentesis). Cirrhosis of the liver is caused by alcohol abuse, viral hepatitis (Β, C and D), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with obesity, diabetes, protein malnutrition, coronary artery disease, corticosteroids, auto-immune hepatitis, inherited diseases (cystic fibrosis, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, etc), primary biliary cirrhosis, drug reaction and exposure to toxins. A limited number of clinical trials are in progress with candidate drugs that specifically address the inhibition or slowing down of fibrosis in the liver. However, these trials target specific liver disease such as NASH (Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis). NASH refers to a combination of fatty liver (NAFLD) with inflammation and occurs in individuals who drink little or no alcohol. Cysteamine is a precursor of the potent liver antioxidant glutathione and increased in vivo production of glutathione is believed to offer improvement of NASH-related liver disease. As such, cysteamine is under evaluation in clinical trial in pediatric patients with NASH. Other antioxidants are under evaluation such as vitamin Ε and selenium but their effectiveness for the treatment of NASH is unknown. Also under evaluation for the treatment of NASH is the use of anti-diabetic drug even in patients without diabetes. This approach addresses the fact that most NASH patients have insulin resistance. Once again, there is a need for novel yet conveniently administered (orally active) efficacious compound for the treatment of liver fibrosis, subsequent scarring and liver cirrhosis. Skin fibrosis Skin fibrosis or dermal fibrosis is excessive scarring of the skin, and is a result of a pathologic wound healing response. There is a wide spectrum of fibrotic skin diseases: scleroderma, nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy, mixed connective tissue disease, scleromyxedema, scleredema, and eosinophilic fasciitis. Exposures to chemicals or physical agents (mechanical trauma, burn wounds) are also potential causes of fibrotic skin disease. Dermal fibrosis may be driven by immune, autoimmune, and inflammatory mechanisms. The balance of collagen production and degradation by fibroblasts plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of fibrotic processes in the skin. Certain cytokines promote would healing and fibrosis, such as transforming growth factor-p (ΤΘΡ-β) and interleukin-4 (IL-4), whereas others are antifibrotic, such as interferon-y (IFN-y) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a). Fibroblasts of normal skin are quiescent. They synthesize controlled amounts of connective tissue proteins and have low proliferative activity. Following skin injury, these cells become activated, i.e. they proliferate, express a-smooth muscle actin (a-SMA) and synthesize large amounts of connective tissue proteins. The activated cells are often called myofibroblasts. Scar formation as part of the wound healing process and which accompanies fibrosis is particularly undesired from a cosmetic perspective during skin fibrosis, especially when the scars are formed on the face and/or other exposed parts of the body. Scleroderma refers to skin fibrosis; sclera means hard and derma means skin. However, skin fibrosis may have important health consequences, especially if it is part of systemic scleroderma. The latter refers to a connective tissue disease of auto-immune etiology. Whereas limited cutaneous scleroderma is restricted to skin on the face and on feet, diffuse cutaneous scleroderma covers more of the skin and may progress to the visceral organs. The most popular approach for treating skin fibrosis is the use of immunosuppressive therapy. The rationale is that the auto-immune etiology is responsible for the inflammation aspect of the disease along with subsequent tissue damage and fibrosis. Studied drugs include methotrexate, mycophenolate, mofetil, cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine. Although some improvement has been observed with immunosuppressive therapy, concerns regarding drug safety along with a lack of definitive clinical data and demonstrable efficacy, remain. There is a need to develop efficacious pharmaceutical preparation for treating skin fibrosis, fibrotic skin diseases and pathological scarring of the skin. Cardiac fibrosis Cardiac fibrosis, a hallmark of heart disease, is thought to contribute to sudden cardiac death, ventricular tachyarrhythmia, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, and heart failure. Cardiac fibrosis is characterized by a disproportionate accumulation of fibrillated collagen that occurs after myocyte death, inflammation, enhanced workload, hypertrophy, and stimulation by a number of hormones, cytokines, and growth factors. Cardiac fibrosis may also refer to an abnormal thickening of the heart valves due to inappropriate proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts but more commonly refers to the proliferation of fibroblasts in the cardiac muscle. Fibrocyte cells normally secrete collagen, and function to provide structural support for the heart. When over-activated this process causes thickening and fibrosis of the valve, with white tissue building up primarily on the tricuspid valve, but also occurring on the pulmonary valve. The thickening and loss of flexibility eventually may lead to valvular dysfunction and right-sided heart failure. The most obvious treatment for cardiac valve fibrosis or fibrosis in other locations, consists of stopping the stimulatory drug or production of serotonin. Surgical tricuspid valve replacement for severe stenosis (blockage of blood flow) has been necessary in some patients. Also, a compound found in red wine, resveratrol, has been found to slow the development of cardiac fibrosis.[Olson et al. (2005) "Inhibition of cardiac fibroblast proliferation and myofibroblast differentiation by resveratrol". American journal of physiology. Heart and circulatory physiology 288 (3): Η1131-8; Aubin, et al. (2008) "Female rats fed a high-fat diet were associated with vascular dysfunction and cardiac fibrosis in the absence of overt obesity and hyperlipidemia: Therapeutic potential of resveratrol". The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 325 (3): 961-8. More sophisticated approaches of countering cardiac fibrosis like microRNA inhibition (miR-21, for example) are being tested in animal models. efficacious pharmaceutical preparation.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As used herein, the term “alkyl” is intended to include both branched and straight chain saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon groups having five or six carbon atoms. Examples of alkyl defined above include, but are not limited to, n-pentyl, n-hexyl, iso-pentyl, iso-hexyl, t-pentyl and t-hexyl. Similarly, as used herein, the term “alkenyl” is intended to include unsaturated straight or branched chain hydrocarbon groups having five or six carbon atoms, and in which at least two carbon atoms are bonded to each other by a double bond, and having Ε or Ζ regiochemistry and combinations thereof. Examples of alkenyl defined above include, but are not limited to, 1-pentenyl, 2-pentenyl, 1-hexenyl and 2-hexenyl. The compounds of the present invention, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may contain one or more asymmetric centers, chiral axes and chiral planes, and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers and other stereoisomeric forms and subsequently may be defined in terms of absolute stereochemistry such as (R)- or (S)-. The present invention is therefore intended to include all such possible isomers, as well as their racemic and optically pure forms. Optically active (+) and (-), (R)- and (S)-, or (D)- and (L); isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents or resolved using conventional techniques, such as reverse phase HPLC. The racemic mixtures may be prepared and subsequently separated into individual optical isomers or these optical isomers may be prepared by chiral synthesis. The enantiomers may be resolved by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example by formation of diastereoisomeric salts which may then be separated by crystallization, gas-liquid or liquid chromatography, or selective reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer specific reagent. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt" is intended to mean those salts which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free acids, which are not biologically or otherwise undesirable. These salts are derived from addition of an inorganic base or an organic base to the organic acid. Salts prepared from inorganic bases include, but are not limited to, the sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, manganese, zinc, iron, copper and the like. Salts prepared from organic bases include, but are not limited to, salts of primary, secondary and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic amino acids (lysine, arginine, and histidine). Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts are also described, for example, in Berge et ai, “Pharmaceutical Salts”, J. Pharm. Sci. 66, 1-19 (1977). Preferred salt of the compound of the present invention are sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium and magnesium; and more preferably sodium. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be synthesized from the parent compound that contains an acid moiety by conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts are prepared by reacting the free acid form of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base in water or in an organic solvent, or in an aqueous/organic solvent mixture. Salts may be prepared in situ, during the final isolation or purification of the compound or by separately reacting the purified compound of the invention in the free acid form with the desired corresponding base, and isolating the product salt. As indicated herein above and exemplified herein below, the compound of the invention has beneficial pharmaceutical properties and may have useful pharmaceutical applications in the prevention and/or treatment of various diseases and conditions in a subject. Medical and pharmaceutical applications contemplated by the inventors include, but are not limited to, those addressing pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis, heart fibrosis and skin fibrosis. The term “subject" includes living organisms in which pulmonary fibrosis can occur, or which are susceptible to such a condition. The term “subject” includes animals such as mammals or birds. Preferably, the subject is a mammal. More preferably, the subject is a human. Even more preferably, the subject is a human patient in need of treatment. As used herein, “preventing” or “prevention” is intended to refer to at least the reduction of likelihood of the risk of (or susceptibility to) acquiring a disease or disorder (i.e., causing at least one of the clinical symptoms of the disease not to develop in a patient that may be exposed to or predisposed to the disease but does not yet experience or display symptoms of the disease). Biological and physiological parameters for identifying such patients are provided herein and are also well known by physicians. The terms “treatment” or “treating” of a subject includes the application or administration of a compound of the invention to a subject (or application or administration of a compound of the invention to a cell or tissue from a subject) with the purpose of delaying, slowing, stabilizing, curing, healing, alleviating, relieving, altering, remedying, less worsening, ameliorating, improving, or affecting the disease or condition, the symptom of the disease or condition, or the risk of (or susceptibility to) the disease or condition. The term “treating” refers to any indication of success in the treatment or amelioration of an injury, pathology or condition, including any objective or subjective parameter such as abatement; remission; lessening of the rate of worsening; lessening severity of the disease; stabilization, diminishing of symptoms or making the injury, pathology or condition more tolerable to the subject; slowing in the rate of degeneration or decline; making the final point of degeneration less debilitating; or improving a subject’s physical or mental well-being. The present invention relates to methods, compounds, compositions and kit for preventing and/or treating pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis, heart fibrosis or skin fibrosis in a subject in need thereof. The term “pulmonary fibrosis” or “lung fibrosis” means the formation or development of excess fibrous connective tissue (fibrosis) in the lung thereby resulting in the development of scarred (fibrotic) tissue. More precisely, pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic disease that causes swelling and scarring of the alveoli and interstitial tissues of the lungs. The scar tissue replaces healthy tissue and causes inflammation. This chronic inflammation is, in turn, the prelude to fibrosis. This damage to the lung tissue causes stiffness of the lungs which subsequently makes breathing more and more difficult. Pulmonary fibrosis is a complicated illness that can arise from many different causes which include microscopic damage to the lungs induced by inhalation of small particles (asbestos, ground stone, metal dust, particles present in cigarette smoke, silica dust, etc). Alternatively, pulmonary fibrosis may arise as a secondary effect of other diseases (autoimmune disease, viral or bacterial infections, etc). Certain drugs such as cytotoxic agents (e.g. bleomycin, busulfan and methotrexate); antibiotics (e.g. nitrofurantoin, sulfasalazine); antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone, tocainide); anti-inflammatory medications (e.g. gold, penicillamine); illicit drugs (e.g. crack, cocaine, heroin); also can cause pulmonary fibrosis. However, when pulmonary fibrosis appears without a known cause, it is termed as “idiopathic” or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Pulmonary fibrotic disorders is thought to begin with acute injury to the pulmonary parenchyma, leading to chronic interstitial inflammation, then to fibroblast activation and proliferation, and finally progressing to the common endpoint of pulmonary fibrosis and tissue destruction. Current research indicates that inflammation is less important in IPF, which appears to be primarily a disorder of fibroblast activation and proliferation in response to some as yet unknown trigger(s). Broadly, the manifestations of fibrotic lung disease can be grouped as follows: they may be chronic, insidious, and slowly progressive; they may be sub-acute, with a resolving, remitting, relapsing, or progressive course; and they may be acute, with a fulminant, progressive, remitting, or resolving course. Disorders with chronic, insidious, and slowly progressive courses are those that clinically resemble IPF and usually share a common pathology (ie, UIP). Many of the connective-tissue diseases (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis; CREST syndrome (calcinosis cutis, Raynaud’s syndrome, esophageal motility disorder, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia); syndrome/progressive systemic scleroderma; systemic lupus erythematosus; mixed connective-tissue disease; pneumoconioses (e.g. asbestosis, silicosis); chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis; and drug-related pulmonary fibrosis (e.g. due to bleomycin) generally fit into this category. Development of clinically apparent lung diseases related to occupational exposures (e.g. pneumoconiosis) generally occurs many years after the exposure. Radiation fibrosis often develops months to years after radiation exposure. A lag time of months or years can occur between the use of pulmonary toxic medications and the development of fibrotic disease. The effect can be dose-dependent (e.g. bleomycin), although, in other cases, the relationship is less clear. Pulmonary manifestations of connective-tissue disease may develop in advance of, coincident with, or many years after the onset of articular disease. Pulmonary sarcoidosis, although sometimes acute or sub-acute in onset, in some cases may present insidiously over time. Sub-acute presentations with a variable course are typified by cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP). COP often develops weeks or months after the onset of a flulike illness. The course is variable and may either spontaneously remit or progress. The disorder is thought to be very responsive to steroid therapy, although it may recur when steroids are withdrawn or tapered. In some cases, COP may progress to end-stage fibrotic lung disease. Disorders with an acute onset are typified by acute interstitial pneumonitis (Α1Ρ), which is an idiopathic form of severe lung injury. The histopathology is that of adult respiratory distress syndrome with diffuse alveolar damage. Patients present either with no antecedent history of lung disease or as part of an accelerated phase of underlying interstitial disease. Most patients progress rapidly to respiratory failure. Some patients may improve with steroids or other immunosuppressive therapy. The term “liver fibrosis” means the formation or development of excess fibrous connective tissue (fibrosis) in the liver thereby resulting in the development of scarred (fibrotic) tissue. The scarred tissue replaces healthy tissue by the process of fibrosis and leads to subsequent cirrhosis of the liver. The term “skin fibrosis” or “dermal fibrosis” means the excessive proliferation of epithelial cells or fibrous connective tissue (fibrosis) thereby resulting in the development of scarred (fibrotic) tissue. The scarred tissue replaces healthy tissue by the process of fibrosis and may be the prelude of systemic scleroderma. Skin fibrosis is intended to cover the fibrosis of any skin tissue and epithelial cells including, without limitation, blood vessels and veins, internal cavity of an organ or a gland such as ducts of submandibular, gallbladder, thyroid follicles, sweat gland ducts, ovaries, kidney; epithelial cells of gingival, tongue, palate, nose, larynx, oesophagus, stomach, intestine, rectum, anus and vagina; derma, scar, skin and scalp. The compounds of the present invention are active for promoting healing of wound and one or more of the following activities: - improving collagen organization and/or reducing wound cellularity in said wound; - reducing collagen overproduction by fibroblast and epithelial cells in said wound; - reducing epithelial mesenchymal transition in said wound; - reducing fibroblast migration and activation in said wound; - reducing and/or inhibiting dermal thickening in said wound; - reducing and/or inhibiting recruitment of inflammatory cells to said wound. The term “cardiac fibrosis” or “heart fibrosis” means an abnormal thickening of the heart valves due to inappropriate proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts but more commonly refers to the proliferation of fibroblasts in the cardiac muscle. Fibrocyte cells normally secrete collagen, and function to provide structural support for the heart. When over-activated this process causes thickening and fibrosis of the valve, with white tissue building up primarily on the tricuspid valve, but also occurring on the pulmonary valve. The thickening and loss of flexibility eventually may lead to valvular dysfunction and right-sided heart failure. In general, prophylactic and therapeutic uses comprise the administration of a compound as described herein to a subject, preferably a human patient in need thereof. The compounds according to the invention may be administered in combination with a therapeutically effective amount of a second compound which can be comprised in the same pharmaceutical composition or in a second pharmaceutical composition. The second compound is advantageously an immunosuppressive drug including, but not limited to, cyclosporine, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, or mycophenolate mofetil; an anti-inflammatory drug including, but not limited to, corticosteroid (e.g. prednisone), a cytokine including but not limited to, interferon-alpha, interferon gamma, interleukine 12; a monoclonal antibody including but not limited to CTGF, TGF-3, MCP-1, IL-4 and IL-13; a multiple receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor including, but not limited to, Nintedanib and the JNK (kinase) inhibitor Tanzisertib (CC-930); an antioxidant such as, but not limited to, N-acetylcysteine, pirfenidone, vitamin Ε, S-adenosyl methionine, or penicillamine; an enzyme inhibitor including, but not limited, to Lysyloxidase-like-2 (LOXL2 enzyme; an integrin inhibitor such as, but not limited to, ανβδ; a lipid receptor modulator including, but not limited to, lysophosphatidic acid receptor antagonists; or a thiazolindione or pirfenidone. A related aspect of the invention concerns pharmaceutical compositions and kits which comprise one or more of the compounds of the invention described herein. As indicated herein above, the compounds of the invention may be useful in preventing and/or treating pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis, hear fibrosis and skin fibrosis. A related aspect of the invention concerns the prophylactic and therapeutic uses of a compound in related to pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis, heart fibrosis and skin fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis can lead to several severe complications. Because the fibrotic lungs have impaired oxygen intake capacity, low blood oxygen levels (hypoxemia) can develop. Lack of oxygen can affect the entire body. Another complication of pulmonary fibrosis is pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs). Scar tissue in the lungs can make it more difficult for blood to flow through them. The increased pressure makes the heart work harder and leads to a weakened and enlarged heart, reducing its pumping efficiency and producing heart failure. This is suspected when people develop fluid accumulations in the abdomen, leg swelling, or prominent pulsations in neck veins. Liver fibrosis can lead to severe malfunction of the liver and can result in complete non-functioning of the liver. Skin fibrosis can lead to hash mark, permanent cicatrix and scar causing severe esthetic problems and stiffness of the skin following a skin injury from a surgery or an accident. Cardiac fibrosis can lead to severe malfunction of the heart and to death. As used herein, the term “therapeutically effective amount means the amount of compound that, when administered to a subject for treating or preventing a particular disorder, disease or condition, is sufficient to effect such treatment or prevention of that disorder, disease or condition. Dosages and therapeutically effective amounts may vary for example, depending upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific agent employed, the age, body weight, general health, gender, and diet of the subject, the time of administration, the route of administration, the rate of excretion, and any drug combination, if applicable, the effect which the practitioner desires the compound to have upon the subject and the properties of the compounds (e.g., bioavailability, stability, potency, toxicity, etc.), and the particular disorder(s) the subject is suffering from. In addition, the therapeutically effective amount that is administered intravenously may depend on the subject’s blood parameters e.g., lipid profile, insulin levels, glycemia or liver metabolism. The therapeutically effective amount will also vary according to the severity of the disease state, organ function, or underlying disease or complications. Such appropriate doses may be determined using any available assays including the assays described herein. When one or more of the compounds of the invention is to be administered to humans, a physician may for example, prescribe a relatively low dose at first, subsequently increasing the dose until an appropriate response is obtained. The dose for oral administration of the compounds according to the invention in human is between 1 to 50 mg/kg, preferably 5 to 20 mg/kg, more preferably 5 to 15 mg/kg, also more preferably about 1 to 10 mg/kg in human. The dose of topical administration of the compounds of the present invention in human is between 0.01 to 10% (w/w), preferably 0.1 to 5% (w/w), and more preferably 1 to 5 %. The metabolism of a mouse eliminates any compound faster than human metabolism, such that for testing of a compound in mice, the dose may be multiplied 10 times to 20 times. As used herein, the term “pharmaceutical composition” refers to the presence of at least one compound according to the invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. “Pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle” refers to a diluent, adjuvant, excipient, or carrier with which a compound is administered. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to drugs, medicaments, inert ingredients etc., which are suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, incompatibility, instability, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. It preferably refers to a compound or composition that is approved or approvable by a regulatory agency of the Federal or State government or listed in the U.S. Pharmacopoeia or other generally recognized pharmacopoeia for use in animals and more particularly in humans. The pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils. Additional examples of pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles include, but are not limited to: Water for Injection USP; aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, Sodium Chloride Injection, Ringer's Injection, Dextrose Injection, Dextrose and Sodium Chloride Injection, and Lactated Ringer's Injection; water-miscible vehicles such as, but not limited to, ethyl alcohol, polyethylene glycol, and polypropylene glycol; and non-aqueous vehicles such as, but not limited to, corn oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl benzoate. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be achieved by addition of antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, isotonic agents are included, for example, sugars, sodium chloride, or polyalcohols such as mannitol and sorbitol, in the composition. Prolonged absorption of injectable compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate or gelatin. In some embodiments, the composition of the present invention comprises an effective amount of a compound of the formula herein above. Particularly preferred are the sodium salts of 3-pentylphenylacetic acid, 3-hydroxy-5-pentylphenylacetic acid and 3-fluoro-5-pentylphenylacetic acid. In some embodiments, the invention pertains to pharmaceutical compositions for preventing and/or treating pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis, heart fibrosis and skin fibrosis. The compounds of the invention may be formulated prior to administration into pharmaceutical compositions using available techniques and procedures. For instance, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated in a manner suitable for administration by topical, oral, intravenous (iv), intramuscular (im), depo-im, subcutaneous (sc), depo-sc, sublingually, intranasal, intrathecal topical or rectal routes. Preferably, the compound(s) of the invention can be orally administered or topically administered. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any methods well known in the art of pharmacy. Methods of preparing these formulations or compositions include the step of bringing into association a compound of the present invention with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle (e.g., an inert diluent or an assimilable edible carrier) and, optionally, one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association a compound of the present invention with liquid carriers, or finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. The amount of the therapeutic agent in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that a suitable dosage will be obtained. Formulations of the invention suitable for oral administration may be in the form of capsules (e.g., hard or soft shell gelatin capsule), cachets, pills, tablets, lozenges, powders, granules, pellets, dragees, e.g., coated (e.g., enteric coated) or uncoated, or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion, or as an elixir or syrup, or as pastilles or as mouth washes and the like, each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the present invention as an active ingredient. A compound of the present invention may also be administered as a bolus, electuary or paste, or incorporated directly into the subject's diet. Moreover, in certain embodiments these pellets can be formulated to (a) provide for instant or rapid drug release (i.e., have no coating on them); (b) be coated, e.g., to provide for sustained drug release over time; or (c) be coated with an enteric coating for better gastrointestinal tolerability. Coating may be achieved by conventional methods, typically with pH or timedependent coatings, such that the compound(s) of the invention is released in the vicinity of the desired location, or at various times to extend the desired action. Such dosage forms typically include, but are not limited to, one or more of cellulose acetate phthalate, polyvinylacetate phthalate, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose phthalate, ethyl cellulose, waxes, and shellac. In solid dosage forms for oral administration a compound of the present invention may be mixed with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate, or any of the following: fillers or extenders, such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, or silicic acid; binders, such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose or acacia; humectants, such as glycerol; disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate; solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; wetting agents, such as, for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate; absorbents, such as kaolin and bentonite clay; lubricants, such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof; and coloring agents. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the pharmaceutical compositions may also comprise buffering agents. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugars, as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. Peroral compositions typically include liquid solutions, emulsions, suspensions, and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles suitable for preparation of such compositions are well known in the art. Typical components of carriers for syrups, elixirs, emulsions and suspensions include ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, liquid sucrose, sorbitol and water. For a suspension, typical suspending agents include methyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, tragacanth, and sodium alginate; typical wetting agents include lecithin and polysorbate 80; and typical preservatives include methyl paraben and sodium benzoate. Peroral liquid compositions may also contain one or more components such as sweeteners, flavoring agents and colorants disclosed above. Pharmaceutical preparation suitable for injectable use may include sterile aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the composition must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the therapeutic agent in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the therapeutic agent into a sterile vehicle which contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying which yields a powder of the active ingredient (i.e., the therapeutic agent) plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. Pharmaceutical formulations are also provided which are suitable for administration as an aerosol, by inhalation. These formulations comprise a solution or suspension of the desired compound of any Formula herein or a plurality of solid particles of such compound(s). For instance, metal salts of the compounds of this invention are expected to have physical chemical properties amenable with the preparation of fine particles of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) for administration by inhalation but not the free acid form of these compounds. The desired formulation may be placed in a small chamber and nebulized. Nebulization may be accomplished by compressed air or by ultrasonic energy to form a plurality of liquid droplets or solid particles comprising the agents or salts. The liquid droplets or solid particles should have a particle size in the range of about 0.5 to about 5 microns. The solid particles can be obtained by processing the solid agent of any Formula described herein, or a salt thereof, in any appropriate manner known in the art, such as by micronization. The size of the solid particles or droplets will be, for example, from about 1 to about 2 microns. In this respect, commercial nebulizers are available to achieve this purpose. A pharmaceutical formulation suitable for administration as an aerosol may be in the form of a liquid, the formulation will comprise a water-soluble agent of any Formula described herein, or a salt thereof, in a carrier which comprises water. A surfactant may be present which lowers the surface tension of the formulation sufficiently to result in the formation of droplets within the desired size range when subjected to nebulization. The compositions of this invention may also be administered topically to a subject, e.g., by the direct laying on or spreading of the composition on the epidermal or epithelial tissue of the subject, ortransdermally via a “patch”. Such compositions include, for example, lotions, creams, solutions, gels, emulsions and solids. These topical compositions may comprise an effective amount, usually about 0.01% to about 10% (w/w), or from about 0.1% to about 5% (w/w), or from about 1% to about 5% (w/w), of a compound of the invention. Suitable carriers for topical administration typically remain in place on the skin as a continuous film, and resist being removed by perspiration or immersion in water. Generally, the carrier is organic in nature and capable of having dispersed or dissolved therein the therapeutic agent. The carrier may include pharmaceutically acceptable emollients, emulsifiers, thickening agents, solvents and the like. The carrier may include vernix. Topical formulation includes one or more excipients such as, but not limited to, protectives, adsorbents, demulcents, emollients, preservatives, antioxidants, moisturizers, buffering agents, solubilizing agents, skin-penetration agents, and surfactants. Suitable protectives and adsorbents include, but are not limited to, dusting powders, zinc sterate, collodion, dimethicone, silicones, zinc carbonate, aloe vera gel and other aloe products, vitamin Ε oil, allatoin, glycerin, petrolatum, and zinc oxide.

Example 21: Effect of Compound I on the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model Intratracheal instillation of the anticancer drug bleomycin into the mouse results in acute inflammation followed by a chronic fibrotic response. Therefore, evaluation of candidate antifibrotic drugs such as Compound I can be undertaken by treatment of the mice at appropriate time points and histologic, biochemical and cellular readouts may be used to monitor candidate drug efficacy in this model. Male C57BL6 mice are administered intratracheal instillation of bleomycin sulphate (0.025U) at day 0, randomized and administered Compound I (oral administration, 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) on day 7 to day 20. Intratracheal instillation of bleomycin induced a significant loss in body weight from day 5 to day 21. Oral treatment with 200 mg/kg of Compound I reduced this body weight loss (Figure 1). Histological examination of lungs from these animals revealed interesting differences. As illustrated in Figure 2, lungs from Compound l-treated animals showed a significant reduction of lesions. Lesions score was evaluated using HEP (Hemalun with Eosin/Ploxine) and Masson’s trichrome staining. Lesions score was recorded as 1) Consolidation as shown by disrupted lung architecture (cellular and/or fibrosis) and 2) Alveolar wall as shown by thickness and shrinking outside of consolidated area. Treatment with Compound I reduced histological lesions in a dose-dependent manner. Figure 3 presents photomicrographs from lung tissue of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. It is evident that treatment with Compound I reduced lesions and fibrosis in lungs. Further analysis of the lung tissue was undertaken. CTGF, collagen 1 and IL-23p19 mRNA expression was quantified by real-time PCR. Our results show that oral administration of Compound I significantly decreased the expression of these inflammatory and fibrotic markers in lungs as shown in Figures 4, 5 and 6, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that treatment with Compound I may be beneficial to prevent the progression, or induce the regression of lung injury that results from the clinical use of anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agents such as bleomycin. Furthermore, our results suggest that treatment with Compound I may be beneficial to prevent the progression of or treat pulmonary fibrosis, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IFF). Example 22: Effect of Compound I and pirfenidone on the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model Pirfenidone demonstrated sufficient drug efficacy for the treatment of IPF in clinical trials to procure approval in Europe and Canada. It was therefore evaluated side-by-side with Compound I in the bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis mouse model by the same protocol described in Example 4 above. Compound I (200 mg/kg) and pirfenidone (400 mg/kg) were orally administered either alone or in combination. Compound I and pirfenidone were solubilized in PBS. In the combination therapy, pirfenidone was solubilized in a solution of Compound I. No toxicity was reported with Compound I treatment. Treatment with pirfenidone induced severe vertigo that was reduced in the combination therapy (Table 1). Table 1: Toxicity related to drug. Compound I and pirfenidone were solubilized in PBS. In the combination therapy, pirfenidone was Compound I (200 mg/kg) No toxicity observed Pirfenidone (400 mg/kg) Vertigo ++++ Compound I + pirfenidone Vertigo ++ solubilized in a solution of Compound I. Histological examination of lungs from these animals revealed interesting differences. As illustrated in Figure 7, the percentage of lungs affected by bleomycin was lower in animals treated with Compound I and the combination therapy (Compound I and pirfenidone). Lesions score was evaluated using HEP (Hemalun with Eosin/Ploxine) and Masson’s trichrome staining and recorded as 1) Consolidation as shown by disrupted lung architecture (cellular and/or fibrosis), and 2) Alveolar wall as shown by thickness and shrinking outside of consolidated area. As presented in Figure 8, treatment with Compound I significantly reduced histological lesions compared to pirfenidone which demonstrated no reduction of fibrosis at the histological level. Combination of Compound I and pirfenidone reduced further histological lesions. The lesions score as determined by the percentage of leukocyte infiltration (inflammatory zone) multiplied by the percentage of collagen found in the leukocyte infiltrate was quantified by histomorphometry using Masson’s trichrome staining. Bleomycin induces a strong increase in the percentage of collagen in the leukocyte infiltration and this is significantly reduced with the oral treatment with Compound I as shown Figure 9. Figure 10 presents photomicrographs from lung tissue of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis stained with HEP. It is evident that treatment with Compound I reduced lesions and fibrosis in lungs as observed by a reduction of disrupted lung architecture and interstitial thickness of alveolar wall and cellular infiltration. Pirfenidone alone has no effect. Visual grading of pulmonary fibrosis was also determined according to Ashcroft’s score. Briefly, the entire fields of each lung section were read by a blinded examiner, and each field was visually graded from 0 to 8. Criteria for grading lung fibrosis were as follows: Grade 0 = normal lung; Grade 1 = minimal fibrous thickening of alveolar or bronchiolar walls; Grade 3 = moderate thickening of walls without obvious damage to lung architecture; Grade 5 = increased fibrosis with definitive damage to lung structure and formation of fibrous bands or small fibrous masses; Grade 7 = severe distortion of structure and large fibrous area; Grade 8 = total fibrous obliteration of lung fields. Masson’s stain showed that alveolar spaces were widened and filled with collagen fibers, indicating proliferative fibroblastic lesions in bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis (Figure 11) that were reduced with oral treatment with Compound I or combination of Compound I and pirfenidone. Pirfenidone alone demonstrated weak activity when graded according to Ashcroft’s method. IPF is a chronic interstitial lung disease which results in end-stage fibrosis. The pathogenesis is believed to be related to a dysregulation in cross-talk between inflammatory and structural cells, mediated by various cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, which are responsible for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and which coordinate the response to injury. Amongst many cytokines tested, 1Μ-β, IL-17 and IL-23 demonstrate marked inflammation, tissue damage and chronic fibrosis; tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and IL-6 induce inflammation and mild fibrosis; IL-4 and IL-13 promote fibrocytes differentiation and fibrosis; TGF-p and CTGF cause minor inflammation but marked progressive chronic fibrosis. In fact, transforming growth factor (TGF)β1 is one of the main profibrogenic cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. It induces fibroblast differentiation into myofibroblasts, which produce high levels of collagen and concomitantly loss of lung elasticity and reduction of the respiratory function. In order to determine the effect of Compound I on pulmonary fibrosis, further analysis of the lung tissue was undertaken. TGF^, CTGF, IL-23 and IL-6 mRNA expression was quantified by real-time PCR. Our results show that oral administration of Compound I and combination therapy significantly decreased the expression of these inflammatory and fibrotic markers in lungs as shown in Figures 12, 13, 14 and 15, respectively. Oral administration of pirfenidone had no effect on CTGF mRNA expression but decreased TGF^, IL-23 and IL-6 mRNA expression. IPF is characterized by exaggerated fibroblast proliferation and accumulation of collagens and fibronectin. Altered fibronectin expression, degradation, and organization have been associated with lung fibrosis. Our results show that intratracheal aspiration of bleomycin increases both collagen 1 and fibronectin (FN-1) mRNA expression. Oral treatment with Compound I, pirfenidone and combination therapy induced a significant reduction of these two fibrotic markers to the control level (Figures 16 and 17). In addition, treatment with Compound I induced a weak reduction of collagen 3 mRNA expression, while pirfenidone treatment has no effect. However, the combination therapy significantly suppressed collagen 3 expression close to the level of control (Figure 18). Example 23: Effect of Compound I on the CCU-induced liver fibrosis mouse model Hepatic fibrosis is an outcome of many chronic liver diseases, including hepatitis Β virus, hepatitis C virus, alcoholic liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and diverse chronic intoxication. It was thus desired to evaluate the effect of Compound I on murine CCU-induced liver fibrosis. Intoxication with CCU results in hepatocyte damage, necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, which spreads to link the vascular structures that feed into and drain the hepatic sinusoid (the portal tract and central vein radicle, respectively), and over 8-30 weeks results in the development of fibrosis to hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, evaluation of candidate antifibrotic drugs such as Compound I can be undertaken by treatment of the mice at appropriate time points and histologic, biochemical and cellular readouts may be used to monitor candidate drug efficacy in this model. CCI4 (10% in corn oil, 2 ml/kg) was intraperitoneally injected twice a week for 16 weeks in male C57BL/6. Compound I (200 mg/kg) was orally administered every day from day 1 to day 113. Mice were euthanasized and histology and liver fibrotic markers were analyzed. To determine if Compound I has an effect on liver fibrosis, hydroxyproline level was used to measure the collagen content in the tissue, which is indicative of liver fibrosis. Oral treatment with Compound I induced a significant reduction of hydroxyproline level in liver (Figure 19). The reduction of collagen level in liver tissue was also observed in histological micrographs using the Masson’s Trichrome staining. Figure 20, Compound I induced a significant reduction of collagen score. The Masson’s trichrome stain the cytoplasm, keratin, muscle fibers and intracellular fibers in red colour; nuclei in black colour and collagen (fibrous tissue) in blue color. As illustrated in Figure 21, all control mice revealed a normal distribution of collagen. Extensive collagen deposition and bridging fibrosis were evident in CCI4-induced animals while significant reduction of collagen deposition and bridging formation between portal-portal of portal-central canal was observed in Compound I treated animals. Another experiment has been performed with Compound 1 and Compound V where CCL4 (10% in olive oil, 2ml/kg) was intraperitoneally injected twice a week for 8 weeks in male C57BL/6. Compound 1 and compound V were orally administered (100 and 200 mg/kg) every day from day 1 to day 58. Mice were euthanasized and collagen content (marker of fibrosis) in the liver was quantified by histomorphometry using Masson’s trichrome staining. Oral treatment with Compound 1 and Compound V induced a significant reduction of collagen content in liver (Figure 22). Example 24: Antifibrotic effect of Compound on skin fibrosis The effect of Compound of the invention on skin fibrosis was studied using normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). In vitro analysis was undertaken to determine the effect of Compound I on TGF-P-induced CTGF, collagen 1 and a-SMA (markers of fibrosis) on normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). Expression of the profibrotic (CTGF) and fibrotic markers (collagen 1 and a-SMA) were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. As shown in Figure 23, 24 and 25, TGF^ (5 ng/ml) induces an upregulation of CTGF, collagen 1 and a-SMA transcript expression which is inhibited by Compound I (500 μΜ): Also, treatment of cells with Compound I alone resulted in a decreased basal expression of CTGF, collagen 1 and a-SMA. Myofibroblasts are terminally differentiated cells derived from fibroblasts, epithelial and mesenchymal stem/stromal (fibrocytes) cells that play an important role in tissue fibrosis via increased matrix synthesis such as collagen. a-SMA is a well-known marker of myofibroblast. Our results indicate that Compound I inhibits fibroblast differentiation as demonstrated by 90 percent inhibition of a-SMA in TGF-3 induced fibroblasts. Myofibroblasts also exhibit an enhanced migratory phenotype (Suganuma et al. 1995) and are capable of releasing numerous pro-fibrotic mediators. The next experiments (scratch assay, invasion/migration) were designed to determine the effect of Compound I on EGF-stimulated normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). In summary, mitomycin-treated NHDF were stimulated with EGF and incubated in the presence or absence (control) of Compound I (0.5 mM). EGF stimulated fibroblast invasion into the scratch which is inhibited by Compound I (Figure 26). Example 25: Antifibrotic effect of Compound on fibrotic marker on fibroblast and epithelial cells CTGF, collagen 1 and a-SMA are fibrotic markers produced by activated fibroblasts and by epithelial cells that undergo to epithelial-mesenchymal transition (ΕΜΤ). TGF-p was used to induce ΕΜΤ in HK-2 cells (epithelial cells) and also to induce activated fibroblasts (normal human dermal fibroblast (NHDF) and rat fibroblast (NRK-49F) to secrete collagen and express strongly a-SMA. Expression of fibrotic markers (collagen 1 and a-SMA) were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. As shown in Table 2, compound of the invention inhibited collagen 1 and a-SMA in both epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Table 2: Percentage of inhibition of collagen in epithelial cells (ΗΚ2 cells) and fibroblasts (NHDF) and percentage of inhibition of a-SMA in fibroblasts (NRK-49F and NHDF) has been determined for several compounds according the invention. In all cases, the mRNA of collagen and a-SMA has been measured, and the inhibition was evaluated in presence of a respective concentration of the tested compound. The compounds have been tested at different concentrations [mM], All compounds reduce the expression of collagen and a-SMA in ΗΚ-2, NHDF and NRK-49F cells.

In summary, male 6-week old Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 5/6-Nx or sham operations. Briefly, two-thirds of the left kidney was removed on day 0 followed by the right total nephrectomy on day 7. A catheter was implanted via the femoral vein on day 7. Sham operated rats underwent exposition of the kidneys and removal of the perirenal fat and were used as controls. Animals that underwent the sham operation were treated with vehicle (water) and were used as controls. On day 21, rats were randomized based on their glomerular filtration rate (GFR) results. 5/6-Nx animals were treated with three times a week intravenous administration of Compound I (10 mg/kg), or with daily oral administration with Compound I (200 mg/kg). Heart fibrosis was determined by the measurement of hydroxyproline (collagen content) and by histological evaluation (ΗΡΕ and Masson’s trichrome staining). As mentioned, implantation of catheter for intravenous administration of compounds in catheterized 5/6 nephrectomized animals is inducing heart fibrosis compare to oral treatment (no catheter). Oral treatment is identified herein with the expression “po” that means “per os”; intravenous administration is identified with the expression “iv” for “intravenous”. As exemplified in Figure 27, 5/6-Nx rats have weak heart lesions. However, implantation of a catheter induced a significant increase (4 times) of heart lesions (fibrosis, necrosis and inflammation). It can see that treatment with intravenous Compound I reduces significantly (p< 0.05) total heart lesions as shown in Figure 28 which include a significant reduction of inflammation as reported in Figure 29 and a significant reduction of necrosis as reported in Figure 30. Further analysis was undertaken to determine the heart collagen content by measuring hydroxylproline, which is detected specifically in collagen. Hydroxyproline content (collagen) is significantly increased in heart of nephrectomized rats, as reported in Figure 31. Both, intravenous and oral treatments with Compound I, induce a significant reduction of hydroxyproline content (Figure 30). This reduction in hydroxyproline (collagen) content correlates with the histological photomicrographs of heart stained with Masson’s trichrome staining which is used to stain collagen (blue). Figures 32 and 33 show photomicrographs of the heart of a representative animal at a magnification view of 40Χ and 100Χ respectively, where the Compound I was administered orally, in comparison with a nephrectomised animal that did not received Compound I. Figure 34 shows photomicrographs of the heart of a representative animal at a magnification view of 40Χ, where the Compound I was administered intravenously, in comparison with a nephrectomised animal that did not received Compound I. Figures 32, 33 and 34 are photomicrographs of the heart of animals showing similar serum creatinine level. In all photomicrographs, it is evident that intravenous and oral treatment with Compound I reduces fibrosis (blue-colored collagen deposition).
