1.162808 IMPROVEMENTS IN A CATHETER ASSEMBLY This invention relates to improvements in a catheter assembly which comprises a catheter tubing, a blunt hollow needle and a guide member which aids connection of the needle in the catheter. In conventional processes for catheter placement into body spaces, such as the lumen of a blood vessel or epidural space, admission is gained by breaching a • wall defining the space with a needle having a hollow bore and an incising forward end, as for example a Tuohy needle. A catheter which by custom comprises a tube made from a flexible elastomeric material with thin walls may then be introduced into the space by either of two methods. Either the catheter tubing may be already in place surrounding the needle with the end just behind the needle point so the catheter tubing follows the needle into the space (the so-called 'needle -inside' assembly) or the catheter tubing may be threaded 116 0 through . the. needle after access to he space.has been achieved (the so-called 'through the needle' assembly). In either case if the catheter tubing is to remain in place for a long period of time, for example during drip feeding or epidural anaesthesia, it is desirable to remove the needle from the patient and from the catheter tubing. If the needle remains in place movements made by the patient may cause the needle point to damage the tissue of the patient or to the catheter tubing itself. Thus to avoid unnecessary and sometimes harmful restraint to the patient the needle is removed. In a 'needle-inside' assembly removal of the needle from inside the catheter tubing may cause damage to the catheter walls resulting in the liberation of small particles of catheter material into the blood stream or may even cut through the wall of the catheter tubing thereby releasing administered liquids prematurely. The length of needle required t for a conventional catheter is awkwardly long. It is known that attempts to overcome these disadvantages have been made by telescoping the catheter tubing behind the point of the needle or by attaching draw wires to short needles. Both approaches may lead to difficult manipulative processes from removing the needle from the patient in view of not 116 808 dislodging the catheter tube from its placement and maintaining sterility. Conventionally, therefore, 'through the needle' assemblies are preferred. However a problem may arise when removing the needle inthat conventionally an adaptor such as a female luer site is fixedly carried at the other end of the catheter tubing to enable a connection to be made to a suitable hollow male fitting for communicating with a dispensing container such as a syringe or blood bag. Assemblies have been described to overcome this problem. British Patent 1,123,624 describes a device in which the needle is withdrawn from the patient but not from around the catheter. The danger of damage to the patient or catheter tube by the incising point of the needle is avoided by securing the needle in a protective sheath. British Patent 1.38 053 describes an assembly in which the needle has lines of weakness along its length which may be cracked open after the placement of the catheter to peel the needle from around the catheter. British Patents 1,437,621 and 1,437,622 describe a hollow slotted needle carrying a catheter. After placement of the catheter the slotted needle is withdrawn from the patient and peeled away from the catheter. Ail 116 808 These assemblies require manipulation of rigid and flexible components close to the site of injection where the danger is present of accidentally dislodging the emplaced catheter. Alternatively the catheter end may be left unencumbered and the connecting adapter fitted after catheter placement. British Patent 1,099,496 describes removable end connector in which the catheter is held in a rubber sleeve slightly compressed about the catheter to provide a seal, the connector being adapted to fit to a coaxial member on a syringe by means of for example a screw thread. British Patent 1,255,086 and United States Patent No. 3,554,580 describes an elastomeric bush used to grip the catheter. The catheter is placed in the bush by threading it through a tube in the bush. The cannula has an outside diameter greater than the internal bore of the bush, thus after removal of the tube from the bush, the bush and catheter form a tight seal. The bush is then formed into a unitary assembly with an adaptor for a dispensing container. This device is not capable of dissaSsembly and subsequent reassembly. British Patent NO. 1430092 describes a 'through the needle" catheter emplacement device which comprises an incising hollow needle secùred in a handle. The handle 116í s08 has a longitudinal bore which is aligned with the lumen of the needle. This longitudinal bore has at least two different diameters, an internal shoulder and a portion which tapers towards the bore. The needle is secured permanently within the broader portion of the bore. In use the catheter passes through the handle and needle into the body, the handle performing no guiding function as is required of the guide member of the catheter assembly of the present invention. The guide member which is present in the catheter assembly of the invention must be removable from both catheter and blunt hollow needle. American Patent No. 3515137 describes inter alfa a catheter inserter for use with a 'needle inside' catheter assembly. The inserter is able to grasp both catheter and needle passing through the inserter by compression of two axially opposed jaws thereby enabling aseptic placement of the catheter and needle into thebody. This inserter does not have an internal shoulder. The inserter fits only loosely around the catheter and needle so is not suitable as use as a guide member to facilitate introduction of a blunt hollow needle into a flexible catheter as they must be held in a fixed spacìal relationship to allow smooth connection. 116 80 One form of connector presently used is a blunt hollow needle, the distal end of which is able to be removably placed into the free end of a catheter and the proximal end of which is held in a synthetic polymeric female luer adaptor. In use it is customary to remove the luer adaptor with its associated hollow needle from the catheter, so as to enable removal of the Tuohy needle, and thereafter reconnect the hollow needle within the free end of the catheter tubing. Thus reconnection of a small diameter hollow needle inside the bore at the end of a flexible catheter tubing can be manipulatively difficult, especially with an epidural catheterisation. The present invention sets out to overcome this'manipulative difficulty and the difficulties which occur with the devices described hereinbefore by providing a catheter assembly which includes a guide member which facilitates and expedites the reconnection. The assembly has the further advantage that it allows for repetitive reconnection iÎ, for example, a luer fitting needs changing to accommodate different dispensing containers. The assembly is readily manufactured, disposable and sterilisable. The present invention provides a catheter assembly which comprises catheter tubing, a blunt hollow needle 116 808 the distal end of which is adapted to be removably held within the rearward end of the catheter tubing and a guide member with a longitudinal bore for aiding the insertion of the blunt hollow needle into the catheter tubing in which the longitudinal bore of the said guide member has a narrower portion and a communicating broader portion, the narrower portion being adapted to receive in close fit the blunt hollow needle and the broader portion being adapted to receive in close fit the catheter tubing and in which the longitudinal bore has a shoulder where the narrower portion meets the broader portion characterised in that the interior end oî the broader portion where it meets the narrower portion is of the same dimension as the external diameter of the catheter tubing whereby the rearward end of the catheter tubing may be held against the shoulder during insertion of the blunt hollow needle into the catheter tubing and both ends of the guide member have a portion which tapers inwards to the longitudinal bore. The hollow needle used in this invention will normally and preferably be mounted in a luer female adaptor Îor attachment to the source of liquid to be eventually passed through the catheter. In use the catheter tubing is inserted into the guide member as far as it will go, the guide member is l$6ZSOt gripped firmly and the hollow needle is inserted into the other end of the guide member and pushed in until it projects far enough through the guidemember to enter the catheter tubing. The guide member is made of polymeric material which most aptly is a thermoplastic material such as polyethylene. Desirably the guide member is adapted to grasp the catheter tubing when the guide member is compressed between finger and thumb. This may be effected by I0 providing the walls of the guide member with longitudinal slots which extend from the end of the guide member (with the broader portion of thebore) to near the shoulder where the broader and narrower portions of the bore meet. The part of the guide member near the shoulder is preferably incompressible so that the end of the catheter tubing does not become compressed and thus the slots are preferably arranged as one or more opposing pairs. Most suitably all components of the catheter assembly are provided in sterile form. If desired the catheter assembly may be or form part. of a sterile procedure pack. To facilitate introduction of the end of the catheter tubing into the guide member, the second longitudinal bore is tapered inwardly towards the interior of the guide member, provided that a cylindrical bore portion remains within which the tubing can be gripped. Generally the two bores will be coaxial and there will be a shoulder where the second longitudinal bore of larger diameter meets the first longitudinal bore. In that the hollow needle may be fully removed and replaced in the guide member a tapered portion is also provided at the end of the first longitudinal bore. If identifiably different from the taper at the end of îî6280- -lOthe second longitudinal bore, no confusion will arise; in any case colour or indicia can be used. It is preferred for the external shape of the guide member not to follow the internal configuration of the first and second longitudinal bores. The guide member could be cylindrical, but may itself slightly taper from the forward to the rearward end since this assists in one of its modes of use, namely, when the catheter tubing is to be gently disconnected by pushing the guide member. In this shape, moreover, there is a relatively high wall thickness around the first . longitudinal bore so that it does not become distorted and prevent smooth movement along the needle. It will be appreciated that reconnection of the catheter tubing and the hollow needle is greatly facilitated. It is only necessary to push the catheter tubing into the wide end of the second OEongitudinal bore until it can no longer move, grip the guide firmly bètween finger and thumb and then slide the catheter tubing and • guide member gently in relation to the hollow needle until this protrudes from the end of the first Rbngïtudinal bore down inside the catheter tubing. However, it is often difficult to manipulate in one hand the assembly of the catheter tubing positìoned inside the guide member and at the same time introduce i16280 -llthe hollow needle with the other hand whilst not simultaneously pushing the catheter tubing out of the guide member. To overcome this drawback it was preferred to develop a güide member which could be held in one hand so as to simultaneously grip and retain the catheter tubing therein. It is therefore preferred that the guide member be so arranged or constituted as to be capable of gripping the catheter tubing when the hollow needle is being inserted and releasing the catheter tubing at other times. Generally, this is acheived by distorting the walls of the second longitudinal bore by pressure for example from finger and thumb, so as to grip the catheter tubing. Thus the guide member may be of a resilient elastomeric material for example rubber. It may alternatively or additionally be provided with slots extending longitudinally of, and usually in communication with, the second longitudinal bore. So as to avoid distorting the open end of the catheter tubing when the catheter tube is gripped (and thereby hindering insertion of the hollow needle) the slots preferably extend only part-way back from the forward end of the guide member so as to leave undistorted the region where the second 116 80 longitudinal bore communicates with the first longitudinal bore. When the finger pressure is removed the catheter tubing is released from "the guide member allowing the guide member to slide along the hollow needle. The invention will be further described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which: Figure 1 shows a longitudinal section through a hub, needle and catheter assembly fitted with a guide member, as assembled prior to use and Figure 2 is a similar section through the assembly in which the guide member is shown in a position disassembled but i ediately before re-connection. Figure 3 and 3A are respectively a longitudinal section and an end view from the right of Figure 3, of a second embodiment of the guide member capable of gripping the catheter tubing. J 1t6 808 Figure I shows the free end of flexible catheter tubing I, attached by a hollow needle 2 held in the free end of the catheter tubing and extending to a hollow metallic or synthetic polymeric hub 3 of characteristic stepped taper as shown for connection to a source of anaesthetic or other fluid. The assembly I, 2 and 3 OEs cÆnventional.in the art, but according to the present invention there is provided around the hollow needle a guide member 4. This guide member possesses a first longitudinal bore 5 with tapered opening 5a, in which the hollow needle is a snüg sŒEEiding fit, and a .- longitudinaoE econd bore 6 with tapered îrusto-conical end 6A at the end nearer the catheter tubing I. This second longitudinal bore 6 terminates in small shoulders 7" at its bottom end. The outer surfåce f the guide member, as shown, is tapered as at 8 but this is optional and a cylindrical guide works equally as well. The same features are shown in Figure 2 but in a slightly different relative position. The assembly is used as follows.. When it is desired to disconnect the catheter tubing I from "the hollow needle 2, so that the Tuohy ueedle can be removed from the catheter tubing, the guide member 4 is gripped in its relatively unyeilding left-hand portion and moved lî6ZS08 gently to the right as shown in Figure 2. The hollow needle can be completely removed from the guide member or can remain in place but retracted, as desired. In either case, this motion serves to gently disengage the free end of the catheter tubing from the Îree end of the hollow needle, so that the Tuohy needle can be removed as it is passed from the free end of the catheter "tubing. To reconnect this assembly the catheter tubing free end is placed exactly as shownin Figu9ë 2 and the lefthand portion of the guide member is again firmly gripped while also preserving a grip on the free end oÎ the catheter tubing OE so that their relative positions are unaltered. The hollow needle., guided within the walls of the first-longitudinal bofe 5, enters the opening at .tHe end of catheter tubing 1 whose extremity has been located within the frusto conical tapered recess and rests on the shoulder 7. It will be apparent that the assembly shown presents several advantages. Instead of threading a hollow needle of small bore into the opening in the end of free flexible catheter tubing, in which it must fit snugly by friction,, the hollow needle is received and retained and guided within a corresponding bore in guide member 4. The catheter tubing only has to be guided into the wide opening of the frusto4conical recess, and it is located for engagement with the hollow 116Z808 needle by its end resting on the shoulder 7 of the guide member. When using the embodiment shown in Figures 1 and 2 it is necessary to hold both the free end of the catheter tubing I and the guide member 4 in one hand, whilst manipulating the hollow needle 2 in the other hand. It is a relatively difficult operation to hold both the free end of the catheter tubing and the guide member in one hand and to maintain their correct relative positioning - there is a possibility that one or other may be dropped accidentally. The second, guide member embodiment is adapted so that after the catheter tubing I hasbeen inserted into the guide member, the catheter tubing is gripped and retained by holding'the guide member for example between the thumb and forefinger and squeezing slightly. In the embodiment of Figures 3 and 3A, the guide member 4 has a slot !I extending part-way along the recess 9 so that a portion 12 of the recess is undistorted when the catheter tube 1 is gripped by squeezing the guide member 4. At each end of the guide member 4 the recesses 5 and 9 each possess a tapered portion 17 and I0 respectively to aid the location of the hollow needle 2 and catheter tubing 1 in their recesses. i16Z808 THE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION IN WHICH AN EXCLUSIVE PROPERTY OR PRIVILEGE IS CLAIMED ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS: l.
