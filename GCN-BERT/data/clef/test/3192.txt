(2) Synthesis of Compound Represented by Chemical Formula 2
Compound 1 (1.00 g, 2.61 mmol) was dissolved in 50 mL of an anhydrous tetrahydrofuran solvent under a nitrogen atmosphere. 1.87 mL of a 2M normal butyl lithium solution was slowly added thereto at −78° C. 9-fluorenone (0.56 g, 3.10 mmol) dissolved in 20 mL of an anhydrous tetrahydrofuran solvent was added thereto. When a reaction was complete, 30 mL of a 2N sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution was added thereto at room temperature. The obtained mixture was extracted with chloroform and distilled water and treated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvents were evaporated from the obtained liquid by using an evaporator, and a yellow solid obtained therefrom was dissolved in 100 mL of acetic acid. 10 mL of a HCl aqueous solution was added thereto, and the obtained mixture was heated while being refluxed for 1 hour. When a reaction was complete, the resultant was extracted with chloroform and distilled water and treated with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The obtained resulting material was purified through a silica gel column by using chloroform:hexane (a volume ratio of 1:3) as an eluting solvent to obtain 0.24 g of a white solid (a yield of 19.7%).
