MAGNETIC CLOSURE, PARTICULARLY FOR BAGS, RUCKSACKS AND THE LIKE The present invention relates to a magnetic closure, particularly for bags, rucksacks and the like. More particularly, the invention relates to a magnetic closure that has a reduced thickness of the closure in its contact part. As is known, magnetic closures, particularly for bags, rucksacks and the like, are increasingly widespread and have a magnet on each of the two parts to be coupled, which must be arranged close to each other so as to obtain the desired closure. Magnetic attraction between the two magnets causes the two portions of the bag, rucksack or the like to move toward each other and remain firmly anchored to each other, thus providing the desired closure. However, in magnetic closures of the known type, the two magnets must be arranged precisely so that one faces the other in order to allow closure. This of course of course sets limitations to the use of magnetic closures, since it forces the user to couple precisely the two portions of the bag, rucksack or the like, having to pay extreme attention so that the two magnets exactly overlap each other. There are also solutions of a known type that provide for a magnetic closure in which the magnet provided on each of the two portions to be coupled does not have to be coupled precisely to the other magnet but can be made to slide for coupling, without having to worry about centering exactly the two magnets connected to each portion of the bag, rucksack or the like. However, the solution described above suffers a drawback, which is due to the fact that the magnet of each one of the two portions to be coupled is exposed internally to said portion, thus contributing to an increased thickness of the magnetic closure with effects that are not aesthetically pleasant and scarcely appreciated by customers. The aim of the present invention is to provide a magnetic closure, particularly for bags, rucksacks and the like, that allows a magnetic closure without having to worry about centering exactly the two magnets with respect to each other and at the same time ensures a reduced thickness of said magnetic closure. Within this aim, an object of the present invention is to provide a magnetic closure, particularly for bags, rucksacks and the like, in which the reduced thickness of the magnetic closure allows to provide bags, rucksacks and the like with a more pleasant aesthetic appearance. Another object of the present invention is to provide a magnetic closure, particularly for bags, rucksacks and the like, that is highly reliable, relatively simple to provide and at competitive costs. This aim, as well as these and other objects that will become better apparent hereinafter, are achieved by a magnetic closure, particularly for bags, rucksacks and the like, comprising a first element and a second element, at least one of the first and second elements comprising a ferromagnetic element to which a magnet is coupled, said first and second elements being adapted to be coupled to respective flaps of a bag, rucksack or the like, characterized in that said magnet is arranged at a face of the respective flap of the bag, rucksack or the like that is opposite the face of said flap that couples for closure to the opposite flap. Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become better apparent from the description of preferred but not exclusive embodiments of the magnetic closure according to the present invention, illustrated by way of nonlimiting example in the accompanying drawings, wherein: Figure 1 is an exploded perspective view of a first embodiment of the magnetic closure according to the invention; Figure 2 is a perspective view of the magnetic closure of Figure 1 ; Figure 3 is a fully exploded perspective view of the magnetic closure of Figures 1 and 2; Figure 4 is a plan view of the magnetic closure of the preceding figures; Figure 5 is a sectional view, taken along the line IV-IV of Figure 4, of the magnetic closure according to the invention; Figure 6 is a partially sectional perspective view of a detail of the male element of the magnetic closure according to the invention, in accordance with a second embodiment; Figure 7 is a transverse sectional view of the male element of the magnetic closure according to the invention shown in Figure 6; Figure 8 is a sectional perspective view of a variation of the second embodiment of the magnetic closure according to the invention; Figure 9 is a transverse sectional view of the magnetic closure of Figure 8; Figure 10 is a partially sectional view of a further variation of the second embodiment of the magnetic closure according to the present invention; Figure 11 is a transverse sectional view of the magnetic closure of Figure 10; Figure 12 is a view of a first variation of the first element of the magnetic closure of Figures 10 and 11 ; Figure 13 is a view of a second variation of the first element of the magnetic closure of Figures 10 and 11 ; Figure 14 is a view of a third variation of the first element of the magnetic closure of Figures 10 and 11. With reference to the figures, in which identical reference numerals designate identical elements, the magnetic closure according to the invention, designated generally by the reference numeral 1, in its first embodiment comprises a first element 2, which in turn comprises a ferromagnetic element 3, around which there is a magnet 4 with a flap 5 of the bag, rucksack or the like, to which the magnetic closure according to the invention is to be applied, interposed between the magnet 4 and the ferromagnetic element 3. Locking of the magnet occurs for example by way of screw means 6, which pass through a central cavity defined in the body of the magnet and screw into a threaded seat 7 that is defined in the ferromagnetic element 3. Conveniently, in the first embodiment the first element 2 is adapted to be inserted in a second element 10, which is constituted by a platelike body 11, which has a cavity 13 this is shaped for example like a keyhole and allows the insertion of the ferromagnetic element 3 and its locking with retention within the cavity 13, by way of the presence of an additional magnet 14 that is arranged below a second flap 16 of the bag, rucksack or the like. As shown in Figure 3, the additional magnet 14 is accommodated in a boxlike body 17 that mates with a plate 18 after the interposition of the second flap 16, with the plate 18 covered by the platelike element 11 with the opening 13 shaped like a keyhole. The coupling between the boxlike body 17 that accommodates the magnet 14, the plate 18 and the platelike element 1 1 occurs by way of adapted screws 19, with the interposition of the flap 16 between the boxlike body 17 and the plate 18. Substantially, at least one of the first and second elements must be provided with a magnet, which is arranged on the face of the flap, to which the element is connected, that lies opposite the face of the flap of the bag or rucksack that abuts against the opposite flap during closure. In this manner the magnet is always arranged outside the face of the flap and the two flaps of the bag or rucksack can couple with a resulting reduced thickness thanks to the fact that there are no elements interposed between the two flaps. In the embodiment of Figures 1-5, the magnet 4 is protected by a covering dome 20, which is locked in its seat by the screw means 6, which are similar to the screw means used in the second embodiment of Figures 6, 7, 8 and 9. Substantially, therefore, the first element 2 has a magnet 4 arranged externally to the flap 5 on which the first element 2 is fixed, i.e., externally with respect to the coupling surface between the flap 5 and the flap 16 of the bag, rucksack or the like. In this manner it is possible to provide a magnetic closure of reduced thickness, since the magnet is external and not internal to the coupling regions between the two flaps 5 and 16. The presence of a second element 10 of the magnetic closure allows the coupling of the ferromagnetic element 3 within the seat 13 of the platelike element 11, with a sort of guide that is defined by the seat 13 with respect to the ferromagnetic element 3, which therefore can slide by coupling within said seat. In the second embodiment of the invention, shown in Figures 6 to 9, the ferromagnetic element 3 is coupled to a disk-like element 22, again made of ferromagnetic material, which in turn is adapted to be coupled to a flap of a bag, rucksack or the like that lies opposite the flap 5 to which the first element 2 is coupled. In this manner, the ferromagnetic element 3 couples to the disk-like element 22, which is integral with the opposite flap of the bag, rucksack or the like. In this second embodiment also, the magnet 4 is arranged externally to the external flap 5 of the bag, rucksack or the like, which couples to the flap 16. Substantially, the magnet 4 is in the opposite position with respect to the face of the flap 5 that couples to the face of the flap 16 and in particular to the disk- like element 22. In a variation of the second embodiment, shown in Figures 8 and 9, the first element 2 is substantially duplicated in a similar element 2 (which defines the second element 10 of the magnetic closure) provided at the opposite flap 16, which therefore constitutes the second element 10 of the magnetic closure. Substantially, both flaps 5 and 16 of the bag, rucksack or the like are provided with a male element, with the ferromagnetic elements 3 and the two elements 2 that couple to each other, and with the magnets 4 of each of the two elements 2 that are arranged always externally with respect to the outer face of the flap 5 and the inner face of the flap 16. Substantially, the magnet 4 of the element 2 that couples to the flap 5 is located entirely outside the bag or rucksack, while the magnet 4 of the element 2 that is coupled to the flap 16 is completely internal to the bag or rucksack. In this manner, the resulting magnetic closure has a substantially reduced thickness and has an aesthetically pleasant appearance. Figures 10 and 1 1 show a variation of the second embodiment of the magnetic closure according to the invention. In particular, these figures show that the ferromagnetic element 3 of the first element 2 of the magnetic closure according to the invention is substantially hemispherical, in order to be accommodated in a corresponding cavity 30 that is defined in the ferromagnetic element 3 of the second element of the magnetic closure. In this case also, the magnet 4 of the second element of the magnetic closure, i.e., the element that couples to the flap 16, is located at the face of the flap 16 that lies opposite the face that couples to the ferromagnetic element 3 of the first element of the magnetic closure. Substantially, one can see that also in the variation of Figures 10 and 11, the coupling between the two flaps 5 and 16 occurs by means of the two ferromagnetic elements 3 that make mutual contact and define the "thickness" of the magnetic closure according to the invention. In the variations of Figures 12, 13 and 14 of the first element of the magnetic closure, it can be seen that the ferromagnetic element 3 is substantially hemispherical and is locked to the first flap 5 by way of screw means 37 above which the magnet 4 is arranged. In Figure 12, the magnet 4 is covered by a dome 35; in Figure 14 the magnet is instead accommodated within a containment element 36. In practice it has been found that the magnetic closure according to the present invention achieves fully the intended aim and objects, since it allows to have a reduced thickness while ensuring an adequate magnetic coupling between the two flaps of the bag, rucksack or the like, that must be coupled together. The magnetic closure thus conceived is susceptible of numerous modifications and variations, all of which are within the scope of the appended claims. All the details may further be replaced with other technically equivalent elements. In practice, the materials used, as well as the contingent shapes and dimensions, may be any according to requirements and to the state of the art.
