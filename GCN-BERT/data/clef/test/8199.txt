METHOD FOR USE OF HOMOPIPERAZINIUM COMPOUNDS IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE The present disclosure relates to novel use and method for the treatment or prevention for treating or preventing cancer or for reducing or stopping the proliferation of cancer cells. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE A broad group of diseases involving unregulated cell growth is known as cancer or as malignant neoplasia. In cancer, cells divide and grow uncontrollably, causing the cells to form lumps or tumors. The cancer may also spread to more distant parts of the body through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not invade neighboring tissues and do not spread throughout the body. For the treatment of cancer, chemotherapeutic, immunotherapeutic or immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic agents have been reported. Agents can be used as monotherapy (treatment with one agent) or as combination therapy (simultaneous, separate or sequential treatment with another agent). The treatments may also be combined with radiotherapy. In this respect, a chemotherapeutic agent means a naturally occurring, semi-synthetic or synthetic chemical compound which, alone or via further activation, for example with radiations in the case of radio-immunotherapy, inhibits or kills growing cells, and which can be used or is approved for use in the treatment of diseases of oncological nature, which are commonly also denominated as cancers. In the literature, these agents are generally classified according to their mechanism of action. In this matter, reference can be made, for example, to the classification made in "Cancer Chemotherapeutic Agents", American Chemical Society, 1995, W.O. Foye Ed. Even if several therapeutic agents have already been investigated and used, there is still a need for new and efficient therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer diseases. One object of the present invention is to provide a method for the treatment of various cancer diseases.

Example 25: Cell proliferation assay: In vitro experiments were conducted on four cancer cell lines: the A549 adenocarcinoma cell line, the H520 squamous cell carcinoma the H82 small cell lung carcinoma and Calu 3 lung adenocarcinoma. The A549 tumor cells, were plated at a density of 1 .5 χ 104 cells per mL and let to adhere on 96-well microplates in F12K cell culture medium enriched with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). The H520, H82 and Calu 3 tumor cells were plated at a density of 5 x 104 cells per mL in RPMI + 10% FCS. After 24 h in culture, the medium was changed and cells were exposed to ASM-024 at concentrations ranging from 10-7M to 10-3M (Fig. 1). After 3 and 6 days in culture, cell growth was quantified using the MTT colorimetric assay (M2128, Sigma) at 575-690 nm or the Cell Titer fluorescence assay (G8080, Promega) at 560/590nm. Tiotropium, a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist and ipratropium, a short-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist were tested as well under the same culture conditions at concentrations ranging from (10~9 to 10"4M) (Figs. 2 and 3). The data illustrated in the figures show a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation on day 3 and day 6 by ASM-024 whereas, except for a cytotoxic effect of ipratropium at 1000 μΜ on A549, no significant cell growth inhibition is observed with either tiotropium and ipratropium. In an another set of experiments, a series of 16 other homopiperazinium compounds, in addition to ASM-024, were tested for their anti-proliferative effect on the four tumor cell lines described above after up to 6 days in culture at concentrations of 10-7M to 10-3M. (Fig. 4) Cell growth was quantified using the MTT colorimetric assay for the A-549, H520 and Calu 3 cell lines and the CellTiter Fluorescence assay.for the H82 tumor cell line These are established method of determining viable cell number in proliferation studies. The preliminary data indicate an inhibitory effect of cell growth for cells exposed to the homopiperazinium compounds compared to vehicle treated cells; this effect appears to be cell line dependant, as well as concentration and time-dependant as a more pronounced inhibition is observed at a higher concentration and after 6 days vs 3 days, in culture. No IC50 could be calculated for Tiotropium Activity expressed as the drug concentration required to inhibit cell growth by 50%. H520 Activity expressed as the drug concentration required to inhibit cell growth by 50%. H82 Unless specified otherwise, activity is expressed as the drug concentration required to inhibit cell growth by 50%. Calu 3 Example 26; In Vitro Anti-Proliferative Properties in other cancer cell lines. The effect of ASM-024 on the growth of MCF7, SK-BR-3, MDA-MB-231 , BT-474 (mammary adenocarcinomas), SK-OV/3 (ovary adenocarcinoma), PC3 (prostate adenocarcinoma) SK-MEL-28(skin melanoma) and C6 (tumor cell glioma) was evaluated. Cells were cultured in RPMI medium and incubated with different concentrations of ASM-024. Cell proliferation was measured on days 3 and 6 by the MTT colorimetric assay. Absorbance at 576-690 nm was analyzed with a microplate reader and expressed as optical density (OD) and as a percentage of the value of corresponding untreated cells. The IC50 was determined as the drug concentration required to inhibit cell growth by 50% from a plot of percent cell viability from control untreated cells versus treated cells. Figs. 5a and 5b illustrate the observed results for the MDA-MB-231 mammary/breast gland adenocarcinoma assay. Cells were incubated with the dose drug shown and growth measured at the days indicated. In Fig. 5a the data is expressed as optical density (OD) and in Fig. 5b as a percentage of the value of corresponding untreated cells. P<0.05 compared to control at same day by Student t-test Example 27: In Vivo Anti-Tumor Properties For the in vivo antitumor assay, nu/nu mice were inoculated subcutaneously in the flank of mice with 2x106 A549 cells in sterile PBS mixed with 50% matrigel. Two days later ASM-024 was administered daily by subcutaneous (at a site close to the tumor) or intraperitoneal delivery at the dose of 30 mg/kg for up to 50 days. When palpable, tumor length and width were measured with a caliper and tumor volume calculated according to the formula Volume = (width2 χ length)/2. Figs. 6a, 6b, 7a and 7b are illustrating the antitumor effect of ASM-024 in A549 tumor cell-bearing mice after 51 days. The antitumor effect of each delivery mode was evaluated by measuring tumor volume (Fig. 6a and 6b) and weight (Fig. 7a and 7b). Values are presented as the mean ± standard deviation. The in vivo antitumor effects of ASM-024, administered by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal delivery, on A549 cells were investigated in a transplanted tumor nude mice model. Tumor growth, as determined by mean tumor volumes, was reduced after treatment with ASM-024 at a dose of 30 mg/kg during the 51 days of observation, compared to the control mice (Fig. 6a and 6b). Mean tumor weight after surgical resection also shows a reduction in tumor mass after treatment with ASM-024 compared to vehicle-treated control mice (Fig 7a and 7b). Example 28: In Vitro antitumor activity of ASM-024-Cisplatin and ASM-024-Taxol Combination Treatments in A549 and MCF7 Cells The concomitant effect of ASM-024 and cisplatin or taxol on the proliferation of A549 lung adenocarcinoma and MCF7 breast cancer adenocarcinoma cells was assessed in vitro. Method A549 cells (3.0 x 103 cells/well) were first cultured with 10% FBS in F12K media and MCF7 cells (10 x 103 cells/well) with 10% FBS in EMEM media for 24 hours to allow cells to adhere to the plate at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% C02. The next day, the media was replaced in medium containing appropriate drug concentrations for two days for an additional 72 hours. Cell viability was quantified using the MTT colorimetric assay (M2128, Sigma) at 575-690 nm. Results Figure 8A and Figure 8B show the percentage of A549 cell growth inhibition after 3 days of drug treatment.. ASM-024 induced a dose-dependent growth inhibition of cell proliferation, the concomitant addition of increasing concentrations of Cisplatin (Hospira) or taxol (Paclitaxel, Biolyse Pharma) to suboptimal doses of ASM-024 potentiated the inhibition of in vitro proliferation. Figure 9A and Figure 9B show the percentage of MCF7 cell growth inhibition after 3 days of drug treatment. A similar potentiated inhibition de cell proliferation was observed following combination treatments of ASM-024 and the chemotherapeutic agents. These results indicate that concomitant treatment with ASM-024 could have clinical applications. ASM-024 may overcome drug resistance to conventional therapeutic doses and thus increase therapeutic efficacy and or allow the administration of lower doses of these drugs thus decreasing their cytotoxicity. Example 29: In Vivo antitumor activity of ASM-024, compared to Cisplatin and Taxol Treatments in xenografts models of human lung and breast cancers Method For the in vivo antitumor assay, A549 human lung carcinoma cells (3.5x 106) in 50% F12K medium (Matrigel) were implanted subcutaneously in the flank of Balb/c nude mice (nu/nu, Charles River) and allowed to grow for 14 days. ASM-024 was administered daily by subcutaneous delivery at the dose of 45mg/kg from day 14 to day 38 post cell inoculation. Taxol was administrated intraperitoneally at the dose of 10mg/kg on days 21 , 28 and 35. Cisplatin was administrated intraperioneally at the dose of 2.5mg/kg on days 28 and 35. From day 14 to day49, tumor length and width were measured once or twice a week with a caliper and tumor volume calculated according to the formula Volume = (width2 χ length)/2. At sacrifice tumor weight was also assessed. Results After 49 days of treatment, a decrease in A549 human carcinoma tumor growth is observed in cisplatin, taxol or ASM-024 treated mice (see Fig. 10A and 10B).
