BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a cleansing sponge with a receptacle, where soap may be deposited therein. 2. Description of Related Art Sponges, brushes, towels and wipes are all tools utilized while cleaning Depending on the type of surface being cleaned a different tool may be preferred. For example, on a tiled bathroom wall the user may select a brush to thoroughly scrub the grout between each tile. Alternatively, for mirrors or glass a soft cloth is preferred to prevent scratches on the smooth surface. Like the various tools used so are the cleansers. Some cleaners are gritty to clean grout or other abrasive surfaces, while others are very silky or a liquid for smooth surfaces. Typically, when using each tool the user will apply the cleanser directly to the surface to be cleaned and then wipe or scrub it away with the tool. Alternatively, the user may place the cleanser on the tool itself and then proceed with their cleaning. In all cases, the cleanser is repeatedly applied because the cleanser is absorbed into the sponge so quickly. Over an extended period of time, this becomes wasteful and tedious because there ends up being more detergent in the sponge than on the surface. Therefore it would be beneficial in the art to provide a cleaning tool that assists to prevent cleansing solution waste while wiping the surfaces. It would also be desirable in the art to provide a cleaning tool able to clean multiple surfaces with a single tool, thereby eliminating the need for multiple tools in a single room. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the prior art, the general purpose of the present invention is to provide a sponge with receptacle, configured to include all of the advantages of the prior art, and to overcome the drawbacks inherent therein. Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a sponge with a receptacle which is comprised of a sponge with an inner cavity. The inner cavity receives a cleaning substance which is then distributed throughout the sponge during use. Another object of the present invention is to provide a sponge with receptacle that has a textured bottom surface as an additional scrubbing surface to use on especially abrasive surfaces. To achieve the above objects, in an aspect of the present invention, a sponge with receptacle is described comprising: a sponge, where the sponge includes a front face and a back face; a textured bottom surface of the sponge; an inner cavity within the sponge; and an opening to the inner cavity within the front face of the sponge, where the opening enables a substance to enter the inner cavity to then distribute the substance throughout the sponge. With the sponge with receptacle the user is afforded a tool that assists to maintain and distribute cleanser during the entire cleaning process. These together with other aspects of the present invention, along with the various features of novelty that characterize the present invention, are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed hereto and form a part of this present invention. For a better understanding of the present invention, its operating advantages, and the specific objects attained by its uses, reference should be made to the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter in which there are illustrated exemplary embodiments of the present invention. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The advantages and features of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following detailed description and claims taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, wherein like elements are identified with like symbols, and in which: FIG. 1 depicts a perspective view of a sponge with receptacle in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention; and FIG. 2 depicts a front view of a sponge with receptacle in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the description of several views of the drawings. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The present invention relates to a cleansing sponge with a receptacle where soap may be deposited therein. The present invention provides a sponge with receptacle to optimize the liquid soap dispensed for use. The sponge with liquid receptacle is a cleansing sponge with a central opening that gets filled with soap. This soap is then circulated through the entire sponge, thereby lengthening the use of the soap while washing dishes, counters and tabletops. Turning now descriptively to the drawings, referring to FIG. 1, a perspective view of a sponge with receptacle 10 is shown in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The sponge with receptacle 10 includes a sponge 12 with a generally cuboidal shape. The sponge 12 includes a front face 14 and a back face 16, and may be colored a bright, vibrant color like yellow, pink, blue, green, red, and the like. A natural sponge material or a synthetic material may be used as preferred by the user. The sponge 12 may include a textured bottom surface 20. The textured bottom surface 20 is abrasive material, able to assist with scrubbing, scouring and scraping thereby enhancing the durability of the sponge 12. The textured bottom surface 20 may be plastic, steel wool, sand paper, pumice stone, bristles or another similarly textured surface. Along the front face 14 is an opening 30 which extends into an inner cavity 32. The inner cavity 32 receives a liquid substance, which is then distributed throughout the sponge 12. The substance may be a liquid dishwashing soap, detergent, tile cleanser, powdered soap or the like. Additionally, the liquid may be a lotion, body wash or moisture cream for application to the body as a personal care item. Referring now to FIG. 2, a front view of the sponge with receptacle 10 is shown in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The front face 14 is illustrated with the opening 30 directly within a center portion. The sponge 12 includes a beveled edge 18 at the top corners for greater comfort and easier grasping within the user's hand. The sponge 12 comprises a height of 1-3 inches, 3-6 inches in length, 2-5 inches in width and 0.25-1 inch diameter opening 30. Preferably, the dimensions of the sponge 12 are approximately 1.75 inches in height, 3.5 inches in length, 2.5 inches in width, and 0.5 inch opening 30. The sponge with receptacle 10 provides a multipurpose cleansing tool able to tackle difficult to clean areas while also maintaining enough soap to finish the job without having to continuously reapply soap while scrubbing. Additionally, the sponge 12 includes rounded or beveled edges 16 for the optimal fit within the user's hand. Along with using the sponge with receptacle 10 as a cleansing tool it may also be used as an applicator for personal care items. For example, the inner cavity 32 may receive lotion or body wash which is then dispensed through the sponge and applied onto the user's skin. The textured bottom surface 20 may then be a brush or pumice stone to scrub rough patches of skin. Therefore, the sponge with receptacle 10 is a useful, multipurpose tool useful for both household cleansing and personal body cleansing. The foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of the present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. The exemplary embodiment was chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. 1.
