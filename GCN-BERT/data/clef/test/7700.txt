A mixture of 4-bromopyridine hydrochloride (1.0 g, 5.1 mmol, 1.2 eq.), bis(pinacolato)diboron (1.31 g, 5.1 mmol, 1.2 eq.), potassium acetate (1.68 g, 17.1 mmol, 4.0 eq.), 2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',4',6'-triisopropylbiphenyl (=XPhos; 0.12 g, 6 mol %), chloro(2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',4',6'-triisopropyl-1,1'-biphenyl)[2-(2'-amino-1,1'-biphenyl)]palladium(II) (=XPhos Precatalyst, 2nd generation; 0.10 g, 3 mol %) and 1,4-dioxane (5 ml) was heated at 100° C. for 3 hours. Then aqueous K2CO3 (3.6 ml of a 3.6 M solution, 12.9 mmol, 3.0 eq.) and 1-chloro-5-isopropoxy-2-methyl-4-nitrobenzene (0.98 g, 4.3 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture further heated at 100° C. for 17 hours. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was filtered over HyFlo® and washed with ethyl acetate (3×20 ml). The organic phase was washed with water (3×20 ml) and aqueous NaCl (20 ml of a 24% w/w solution) and dried over Na2SO4. The volatiles were removed under vacuum and the crude material was purified by silica gel chromatography (ethyl acetate/heptane) to yield 4-(5-isopropoxy-2-methyl-4-nitrophenyl)pyridine (0.95 g, 81% yield) as a yellow solid.
