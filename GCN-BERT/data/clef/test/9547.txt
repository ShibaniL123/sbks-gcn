(1) Preparation of 2-(2-chloroethyl)pyridine
2-Pyridine-ethanol (15.00 g, 122 mmol), triphenyl phosphine (38.40 g, 146 mmol) and carbon tetrachloride (100 mL) were put in a 500-mL flask, and heated under reflux. After 1.5 hours, triphenyl phosphine (9.60 g, 36.6 mmol) was added thereto and further heated for 30 minutes under reflux.
The reaction liquid was cooled down to room temperature, and then pentane (200 mL) was added thereto, and filtered using a Kiriyama funnel. The resultant filtrate was concentrated to give a crude product (17.07 g). This was distilled under reduced pressure to give 11.16 g (yield 65.8%, purity 97.1%) of 2-(2-chloroethyl)pyridine.
