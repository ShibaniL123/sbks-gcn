BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The invention is directed to 8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane compounds which are useful as mu opioid receptor antagonists. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, methods of using such compounds for treating or ameliorating medical conditions mediated by mu opioid receptor activity, and processes and intermediates useful for preparing such compounds. 2. State of the Art It is now generally understood that endogenous opioids play a complex role in gastrointestinal physiology. Opioid receptors are expressed throughout the body, both in the central nervous system and in peripheral regions including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Compounds which function as agonists at opioid receptors, of which morphine is a prototypical example, are the mainstays of analgesic therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. Unfortunately, use of opioid analgesics is often associated with adverse effects on the GI tract, collectively termed opioid-induced bowel dysfunction (OBD). OBD includes symptoms such as constipation, decreased gastric emptying, abdominal pain and discomfort, bloating, nausea, and gastroesophageal reflux. Both central and peripheral opioid receptors are likely involved in the slowdown of gastrointestinal transit after opioid use. However, evidence suggests that peripheral opioid receptors in the GI tract are primarily responsible for the adverse effects of opioids on GI function. Since the side effects of opioids are predominantly mediated by peripheral receptors, whereas the analgesia is central in origin, a peripherally selective antagonist can potentially block undesirable GI-related side effects without interfering with the beneficial central effects of analgesia or precipitating central nervous system withdrawal symptoms. Of the three major opioid receptor subtypes, denoted mu, delta, and kappa, most clinically-used opioid analgesics are thought to act via mu opioid receptor activation to exert analgesia and to alter GI motility. Accordingly, peripherally selective mu opioid antagonists are expected to be useful for treating opioid-induced bowel dysfunction. Preferred agents will demonstrate significant binding to mu opioid receptors in vitro and be active in vivo in GI animal models. Postoperative ileus (POI) is a disorder of reduced motility of the GI tract that occurs after abdominal or other surgery. The symptoms of POI are similar to those of OBD. Furthermore, since surgical patients are often treated during and after surgery with opioid analgesics, the duration of POI may be compounded by the reduced GI motility associated with opioid use. Mu opioid antagonists useful for treating OBD are therefore also expected to be beneficial in the treatment of POI.

General Synthetic Procedures Compounds of the invention can be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. Although a particular aspect of the present invention is illustrated in the schemes below, those skilled in the art will recognize that all aspects of the present invention can be prepared using the methods described herein or by using other methods, reagents and starting materials known to those skilled in the art. It will also be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures. Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. The choice of a suitable protecting group for a particular functional group, as well as suitable conditions for protection and deprotection, are well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups, and their introduction and removal, are described in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Wiley, New York, 1999, and references cited therein. In one method of synthesis, compounds of the invention of formula (Id), in which R2 is defined as —C(O)R3 or —C(O)R8, are prepared as illustrated in Scheme A. (The substituents and variables shown in the following schemes have the definitions provided above unless otherwise indicated). In Scheme A, R9 represents R3 or R8, R9a represents R3, a protected form of R3, or R8, and L represents a leaving group, such as chloro, or R9aC(O)-L represents a carboxylic acid or a carboxylate salt. For example, to prepare a compound in which R3 is —CH2OH, a useful reagent is acetoxyacetyl chloride, in which R9a is —CH2OC(O)CH3 and L is chloro. When R9a is a protected form of R3, the reaction also includes a deprotection step, which is not shown. Optimal reaction conditions for the reaction of Scheme A may vary depending on the chemical properties of the reagent R9aC(O)-L, as is well known to those skilled in the art. For example, when L is a halo leaving group, such as chloro, the reaction is typically conducted by contacting intermediate (II) with between about 1 and about 2 equivalents of a compound of formula R9aC(O)-L in an inert diluent, such as dichloromethane. Optionally, the reaction is conducted in the presence of base, for example between about 2 and about 6 equivalents of base, such as N,N-diisopropylethylamine or triethylamine. Suitable inert diluents also include 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylacetamide, and the like. The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature in the range of about −50° C. to about 30° C. for about a quarter hour to about 16 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. When the reagent R9aC(O)-L is a carboxylic acid or a carboxylate salt, the reaction is typically conducted by contacting intermediate (II) with between about 1 and about 5 equivalents of the acid R9aC(O)OH or the carboxylate salt, for example, R9aC(O)OLi, in an inert diluent, optionally in the presence of an excess of base, both as described above, and in the presence of between about 1 and about 6 equivalents of an activating agent such as N,N-carbonyl diimidazole (CDI), N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)uronium hexafluorophosphate (HATU) or 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC). The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature in the range of about 25° C. to about 100° C. for about 2 hours to about 16 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. Compounds of the invention in which R2 is —C(O)NHR4, —C(O)OR5, or S(O)2R6 may be prepared by similar processes using reagents R4—N═C═O, R5OC(O)-L′ and R6—S(O)2-L′, respectively, where L′ represents a halo leaving group, in place of R9aC(O)-L. A general procedure for the preparation of an intermediate of formula (II) is illustrated in Scheme B where P1 represents an amino-protecting group. In Scheme B, intermediate (IV) is reductively N-alkylated by reaction with the aldehyde (III) to provide protected intermediate (V). The reaction is typically conducted by contacting intermediate (IV) with between about 1 and about 2 equivalents of an aldehyde of formula (III) in a suitable inert diluent, such as dichloromethane, in the presence of between about 0.9 and about 2 equivalents of a reducing agent. The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature in the range of about 0° C. to ambient temperature for about a half hour to about 3 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. Typical reducing agents include sodium triacetoxyborohydride, sodium borohydride, and sodium cyanoborohydride. The product (V) is isolated by conventional means. The deprotection of (V) uses standard procedures. For example, when the protecting group P1 is Boc, (V) is typically treated with an acid, such as trifluoroacetic acid to provide intermediate (II). When the protecting group is benzyloxycarbonyl (Cbz), (V) may be deprotected by catalytic hydrogenation, with, for example, a palladium hydroxide on carbon catalyst. An exemplary process for the preparation of intermediates of formula (III′) where R7 is —CH2—R1 is illustrated in Scheme C: where all the variables take the values defined above. First, an amino-protecting group is added to intermediate (VI) by conventional procedures to form intermediate (VII), which is oxidized, for example, in the presence of a sulfur trioxide pyrdium complex, to provide an intermediate of formula (III′). The 8-azabicyclooctyl-2-hydroxybenzamide intermediate (IV) may be prepared by the Suzuki coupling of the bicyclic vinyl boronate (XII) with the benzyloxy-bromobenzamide (X) as shown in step (c) of Scheme D below. The benzamide intermediate (X) may be prepared from 3-bromo-2-fluoro-benzonitrile (VIII) by the route shown in step (a) in which (VIII) is first converted to intermediate (IX), where Bn denotes the protecting group benzyl, by reaction with benzyl alcohol. The nitrile (IX) is then hydrolyzed to the corresponding amide to provide intermediate (X). The hydrolysis reaction may be performed by contacting (IX) with an excess of water in the presence of a platinum dialkylphosphonite catalyst, commonly termed Parkin's catalyst. The reaction is typically performed at reflux temperature for about 2 to about 20 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. The bicyclic vinyl boronate (XII) may be prepared by reaction of the protected bicyclooctene intermediate (XI), where P1 represents an amino-protecting group, typically Boc or benzyl, and —OTf represents trifluoromethane sulfonate (commonly triflate) with bis(pinacolato)diboron as shown in step (b). The reaction is typically conducted by contacting (XII) with between about 1 and about 1.2 equivalents of bis(pinacolato)diboron in the presence of a catalytic amount of a palladium catalyst and a phosphine ligand, for example [1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium (II) (Pd(dppf)Cl2) and 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf). The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature between about 40 and about 80° C. for between about 4 and about 20 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. The protected bicyclooctene intermediate (XI) used in step (b), where P1 is benzyl, is conveniently prepared from 8-benzyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one: by contacting the octanone with between about 1 and about 1.5 equivalents of N-phenyl-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide) and between about 1 and about 1.5 equivalents of a base, such as sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide. The reaction is typically conducted at a temperature between about −20 and about −10° C. for between about one half to about two hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. To prepare intermediate (XI) in which P1 is Boc, the benzyl-protected octanone is first converted to the Boc-protected form by reaction with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (commonly Boc2O) and catalytic hydrogenation. The Boc-protected octanone is then reacted with N-phenyl-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonimide) and base as described above. The reaction of the Boc intermediate is typically conducted at a temperature, less than about −70° C., for between about 2 and about 5 hours, or until the reaction is substantially complete. Finally, the bicyclic vinyl boronate (XII) and benzamide intermediate (X) are coupled to provide the protected intermediate (XIII), which is reduced and deprotected in one or more steps, to provide the 8-azabicyclooctyl-2-hydroxybenzamide intermediate (IV). The reaction is typically conducted by contacting (XII) with about 1 equivalent of intermediate (X) in the presence of a palladium catalyst, for example, bis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(II)chloride (PdCl2(PPh3)2). The reaction is typically conducted at reflux temperature for between about 4 and about 20 hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. When P1 is Boc, typically, the Boc protecting group is first removed by conventional treatment with trifluoroacetic acid and then the bicyclooctene is simultaneously reduced and deprotected by palladium catalyzed hydrogenation. When a benzyl protecting group is used for P1, the double bond reduction and removal of both benzyl groups can be accomplished in a single hydrogenation step. An alternative process for the preparation of intermediate (IV) using Boc protected intermediate (XII′) is illustrated in Scheme E: in which the order of the Suzuki coupling and the conversion of the nitrile to the amide is reversed. As shown in Scheme E, and described in the examples below, the 2-benzyloxy-3-bromo-benzonitrile intermediate (IX) is coupled to the bicyclic boronate (XII′) to form nitrile intermediate (XIV). In subsequent steps, the Boc group is deprotected from the nitrile intermediate, the cyano group is hydrolyzed, and finally the double bond is reduced and the benzyl protecting group is removed to form the 2-hydroxybenzamide (IV). Yet another alternative process for the preparation of intermediate (IV) is illustrated in Scheme F: First, the benzyl-protected bicyclooctene intermediate (XI′) is reacted with 2-butoxy-3-bromo-benzonitrile, the butoxy analog of intermediate (IX) to form the nitrile intermediate (XV). The reaction is typically conducted by contacting intermediate (XI′) with between about 1 and about 1.5 equivalents of 2-butoxy-3-bromo-benzonitrile in an inert diluent, such as tetrahydrofuran, in the presence of between about 1 and about 1.5 equivalents of isopropylmagnesium chloride and a transition metal catalyst. The reaction is typically performed at reflux temperature for about one-half to about three hours or until the reaction is substantially complete. Intermediate (XV) is refluxed in an acidic solution to simultaneously hydrolyze the cyano group to the amide and remove the tert-butyl hydroxy-protecting group to provide intermediate (XVI). Finally, (XVI) is converted to the benzamide product (IV), in a single step, by reaction with between about 10 and about 15 equivalents of ammonium formate, in the presence of a palladium catalyst, which simultaneously reduces the bicyclooctene and removes the benzyl amino-protecting group. Further details regarding specific reaction conditions and other procedures for preparing representative compounds of the invention or intermediates thereto are described in the examples below. Accordingly, in a method aspect, the invention provides a process for preparing a compound of formula (Id), or a salt or protected derivative thereof, the process comprising reacting a compound of formula (II) with a compound of formula R9aC(O)-L, and optionally removing a protecting group, to provide a compound of formula (Id), or a salt or protected derivative thereof. In an additional aspect, the invention provides a compound of formula (II) and a compound of formula (IV), wherein the variables R7 and m take any of the values described in aspects of the invention disclosed above. Pharmaceutical Compositions The 8-azabicyclooctane-2-hydroxybenzamide compounds of the invention are typically administered to a patient in the form of a pharmaceutical composition or formulation. Such pharmaceutical compositions may be administered to the patient by any acceptable route of administration including, but not limited to, oral, rectal, vaginal, nasal, inhaled, topical (including transdermal) and parenteral modes of administration. Accordingly, in one of its compositions aspects, the invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier or excipient and a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Optionally, such pharmaceutical compositions may contain other therapeutic and/or formulating agents if desired. When discussing compositions, the “compound of the invention” may also be referred to herein as the “active agent”. As used herein, the term “compound of the invention” is intended to include compounds of formula (I) as well as the species embodied in formulas (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), and (Id). “Compound of the invention” includes, in addition, pharmaceutically-acceptable salts and solvates of the compound unless otherwise indicated. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention typically contain a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically-acceptable salt thereof. Typically, such pharmaceutical compositions will contain from about 0.1 to about 95% by weight of the active agent; preferably, from about 5 to about 70% by weight; and more preferably from about 10 to about 60% by weight of the active agent. Any conventional carrier or excipient may be used in the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention. The choice of a particular carrier or excipient, or combinations of carriers or excipients, will depend on the mode of administration being used to treat a particular patient or type of medical condition or disease state. In this regard, the preparation of a suitable pharmaceutical composition for a particular mode of administration is well within the scope of those skilled in the pharmaceutical arts. Additionally, the carriers or excipients used in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are commercially-available. By way of further illustration, conventional formulation techniques are described in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th Edition, Lippincott Williams & White, Baltimore, Md. (2000); and H. C. Ansel et al., Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, 7th Edition, Lippincott Williams & White, Baltimore, Md. (1999). Representative examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, the following: sugars, such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches, such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose, such as microcrystalline cellulose, and its derivatives, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; excipients, such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils, such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols, such as propylene glycol; polyols, such as glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol and polyethylene glycol; esters, such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents, such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol; phosphate buffer solutions; and other non-toxic compatible substances employed in pharmaceutical compositions. Pharmaceutical compositions are typically prepared by thoroughly and intimately mixing or blending the active agent with a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier and one or more optional ingredients. The resulting uniformly blended mixture can then be shaped or loaded into tablets, capsules, pills and the like using conventional procedures and equipment. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are preferably packaged in a unit dosage form. The term “unit dosage form” refers to a physically discrete unit suitable for dosing a patient, i.e., each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active agent calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect either alone or in combination with one or more additional units. For example, such unit dosage forms may be capsules, tablets, pills, and the like, or unit packages suitable for parenteral administration. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are suitable for oral administration. Suitable pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration may be in the form of capsules, tablets, pills, lozenges, cachets, dragees, powders, granules; or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion; or as an elixir or syrup; and the like; each containing a predetermined amount of a compound of the present invention as an active ingredient. When intended for oral administration in a solid dosage form (i.e., as capsules, tablets, pills and the like), the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will typically comprise the active agent and one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable carriers, such as sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate. Optionally or alternatively, such solid dosage forms may also comprise: fillers or extenders, such as starches, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and/or silicic acid; binders, such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, sucrose and/or acacia; humectants, such as glycerol; disintegrating agents, such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and/or sodium carbonate; solution retarding agents, such as paraffin; absorption accelerators, such as quaternary ammonium compounds; wetting agents, such as cetyl alcohol and/or glycerol monostearate; absorbents, such as kaolin and/or bentonite clay; lubricants, such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and/or mixtures thereof; coloring agents; and buffering agents.

Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be formulated to provide slow or controlled release of the active agent using, by way of example, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose in varying proportions; or other polymer matrices, liposomes and/or microspheres. In addition, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may optionally contain opacifying agents and may be formulated so that they release the active ingredient only, or preferentially, in a certain portion of the gastrointestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes. The active agent can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of the above-described excipients. Suitable liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, by way of illustration, pharmaceutically-acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. Liquid dosage forms typically comprise the active agent and an inert diluent, such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers, such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, oils (esp., cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Suspensions, in addition to the active ingredient, may contain suspending agents such as, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof. The compounds of this invention can also be administered parenterally (e.g. by intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular or intraperitoneal injection). For parenteral administration, the active agent is typically admixed with a suitable vehicle for parenteral administration including, by way of example, sterile aqueous solutions, saline, low molecular weight alcohols such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, vegetable oils, gelatin, fatty acid esters such as ethyl oleate, and the like. Parenteral formulations may also contain one or more anti-oxidants, solubilizers, stabilizers, preservatives, wetting agents, emulsifiers, buffering agents, or dispersing agents. These formulations may be rendered sterile by use of a sterile injectable medium, a sterilizing agent, filtration, irradiation, or heat. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are formulated for administration by inhalation. Suitable pharmaceutical compositions for administration by inhalation will typically be in the form of an aerosol or a powder. Such compositions are generally administered using well-known delivery devices, such as a metered-dose inhaler, a dry powder inhaler, a nebulizer or a similar delivery device. When administered by inhalation using a pressurized container, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will typically comprise the active ingredient and a suitable propellant, such as dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. Additionally, the pharmaceutical composition may be in the form of a capsule or cartridge (made, for example, from gelatin) comprising a compound of the invention and a powder suitable for use in a powder inhaler. Suitable powder bases include, by way of example, lactose or starch. The compounds of the invention can also be administered transdermally using known transdermal delivery systems and excipients. For example, the active agent can be admixed with permeation enhancers, such as propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol monolaurate, azacycloalkan-2-ones and the like, and incorporated into a patch or similar delivery system. Additional excipients including gelling agents, emulsifiers and buffers, may be used in such transdermal compositions if desired. If desired, the compounds of this invention may be administered in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents. In this embodiment, a compound of this invention is either physically mixed with the other therapeutic agent to form a composition containing both agents; or each agent is present in separate and distinct compositions which are administered to the patient simultaneously or sequentially. For example, a compound of formula I can be combined with second therapeutic agent using conventional procedures and equipment to form a composition comprising a compound of formula I and a second therapeutic agent. Additionally, the therapeutic agents may be combined with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I, a second therapeutic agent and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In this embodiment, the components of the composition are typically mixed or blended to create a physical mixture. The physical mixture is then administered in a therapeutically effective amount using any of the routes described herein. Alternatively, the therapeutic agents may remain separate and distinct before administration to the patient. In this embodiment, the agents are not physically mixed together before administration but are administered simultaneously or at separate times as separate compositions. Such compositions can be packaged separately or may be packaged together as a kit. The two therapeutic agents in the kit may be administered by the same route of administration or by different routes of administration. Any therapeutic agent compatible with the compounds of the present invention may be used as the second therapeutic agent. In particular, prokinetic agents acting via mechanisms other than mu opioid receptor antagonism may be used in combination with the present compounds. For example, 5-HT4 receptor agonists, such as tegaserod, renzapride, mosapride, prucalopride, 1-isopropyl-1H-indazole-3-carboxylic acid {(1S,3R,5R)-8-[2-(4-acetylpiperazin-1-yl)ethyl]-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-yl}amide, 1-isopropyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxylic acid {(1S,3R,5R)-8-[(R)-2-hydroxy-3-(methanesulfonyl-methyl-amino)propyl]-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-yl}amide, and 4-(4-{[(2-isopropyl-1H-benzoimidazole-4-carbonyl)amino]methyl}-piperidin-1-ylmethyl)piperidine-1-carboxylic acid methyl ester and pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof may be used as the second therapeutic agent. Additional useful prokinetic agents and other agents for gastrointestinal disorders include, but are not limited to, 5-HT3 receptor agonists (e.g. pumosetrag), 5-HT1A receptor antagonists (e.g. AGI 001), alpha-2-delta ligands (e.g. PD-217014), chloride channel openers (e.g. lubiprostone), dopamine antagonists (e.g. itopride, metaclopramide, domperidone), GABA-B agonists (e.g. baclofen, AGI 006), kappa opioid agonists (e.g. asimadoline), muscarinic M1 and M2 antagonists (e.g. acotiamide), motilin agonists (e.g. mitemcinal), guanylate cyclase activators (e.g. MD-1100) and ghrelin agonists (e.g. Tzp 101, RC 1139). In addition, the compounds of the invention can be combined with opioid therapeutic agents. Such opioid agents include, but are not limited to, morphine, pethidine, codeine, dihydrocodeine, oxycontin, oxycodone, hydrocodone, sufentanil, fentanyl, remifentanil, buprenorphine, methadone, and heroin. Numerous additional examples of such therapeutic agents are known in the art and any such known therapeutic agents may be employed in combination with the compounds of this invention. Secondary agent(s), when included, are present in a therapeutically effective amount, i.e. in any amount that produces a therapeutically beneficial effect when co-administered with a compound of the invention. Suitable doses for the other therapeutic agents administered in combination with a compound of the invention are typically in the range of about 0.05 μg/day to about 100 mg/day. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the invention optionally include a second therapeutic agent as described above.

It will be understood that any form of the compounds of the invention, (i.e. free base, pharmaceutical salt, or solvate) that is suitable for the particular mode of administration, can be used in the pharmaceutical compositions discussed above. Utility The 8-azabicyclooctane compounds of the invention are antagonists at the mu opioid receptor and therefore are expected to be useful for treating medical conditions mediated by mu opioid receptors or associated with mu opioid receptor activity, i.e. medical conditions which are ameliorated by treatment with a mu opioid receptor antagonist. In particular, the compounds of the invention are expected to be useful for treating adverse effects associated with use of opioid analgesics, i.e. symptoms such as constipation, decreased gastric emptying, abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, and gastroesophageal reflux, termed collectively opioid-induced bowel dysfunction. The mu opioid receptor antagonists of the invention are also expected to be useful for treating post-operative ileus, a disorder of reduced motility of the gastrointestinal tract that occurs after abdominal or other surgery. In addition, it has been suggested that mu opioid receptor antagonist compounds may be used for reversing opioid-induced nausea and vomiting. Further, those mu opioid receptor antagonists exhibiting some central penetration may be useful in the treatment of dependency on, or addiction to, narcotic drugs, alcohol, or gambling, or in preventing, treating, and/or ameliorating obesity. Since compounds of the invention increase motility of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract in animal models, the compounds are expected to be useful for treating disorders of the GI tract caused by reduced motility in mammals, including humans. Such GI motility disorders include, by way of illustration, chronic constipation, constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (C-IBS), diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis, and functional dyspepsia. In one aspect, therefore, the invention provides a method of increasing motility of the gastrointestinal tract in a mammal, the method comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a pharmaceutically-acceptable carrier and a compound of the invention. When used to treat disorders of reduced motility of the GI tract or other conditions mediated by mu opioid receptors, the compounds of the invention will typically be administered orally in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day, although other forms of administration may be used. For example, particularly when used to treat post-operative ileus, the compounds of the invention may be administered parenterally. The amount of active agent administered per dose or the total amount administered per day will typically be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances, including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual compound administered and its relative activity, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like. Suitable doses for treating disorders of reduced motility of the GI tract or other disorders mediated by mu opioid receptors will range from about 0.0007 to about 20 mg/kg/day of active agent, including from about 0.0007 to about 1.4 mg/kg/day. For an average 70 kg human, this would amount to from about 0.05 to about 100 mg per day of active agent. In one aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention are used to treat opioid-induced bowel dysfunction. When used to treat opioid-induced bowel dysfunction, the compounds of the invention will typically be administered orally in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day. Preferably, the dose for treating opioid-induced bowel dysfunction will range from about 0.05 to about 100 mg per day. In another aspect of the invention, the compounds of the invention are used to treat post-operative ileus. When used to treat post-operative ileus, the compounds of the invention will typically be administered orally or intravenously in a single daily dose or in multiple doses per day. Preferably, the dose for treating post-operative ileus will range from about 0.05 to about 100 mg per day. The invention also provides a method of treating a mammal having a disease or condition associated with mu opioid receptor activity, the method comprising administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention or of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of the invention. As described above, compounds of the invention are mu opioid receptor antagonists. The invention further provides, therefore, a method of antagonizing a mu opioid receptor in a mammal, the method comprising administering a compound of the invention to the mammal. The mu opioid receptor antagonists of the invention are optionally administered in combination with another therapeutic agent or agents, in particular, in combination with prokinetic agents acting via non-mu opioid mechanisms. Accordingly, in another aspect, the methods and compositions of the invention further comprise a therapeutically effective amount of another prokinetic agent. In addition, the compounds of the invention are also useful as research tools for investigating or studying biological systems or samples having mu opioid receptors, or for discovering new compounds having mu opioid receptor activity. Any suitable biological system or sample having mu opioid receptors may be employed in such studies which may be conducted either in vitro or in vivo. Representative biological systems or samples suitable for such studies include, but are not limited to, cells, cellular extracts, plasma membranes, tissue samples, mammals (such as mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, dogs, pigs, etc.) and the like. The effects of contacting a biological system or sample comprising a mu opioid receptor with a compound of the invention are determined using conventional procedures and equipment, such as the radioligand binding assay and functional assay described herein or other functional assays known in the art. Such functional assays include, but are not limited to, ligand-mediated changes in intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), ligand-mediated changes in activity of the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, ligand-mediated changes in incorporation of analogs of guanosine triphosphate (GTP), such as [35S]GTPγS (guanosine 5′-O-(γ-thio)triphosphate) or GTP-Eu, into isolated membranes via receptor catalyzed exchange of GTP analogs for GDP analogs, and ligand-mediated changes in free intracellular calcium ions. A suitable concentration of a compound of the invention for such studies typically ranges from about 1 nanomolar to about 500 nanomolar. When using compounds of the invention as research tools for discovering new compounds have mu opioid receptor activity, binding or functional data for a test compound or a group of test compounds is compared to the mu opioid receptor binding or functional data for a compound of the invention to identify test compounds that have superior binding or functional activity, if any. This aspect of the invention includes, as separate embodiments, both the generation of comparison data (using the appropriate assays) and the analysis of the test data to identify test compounds of interest. Among other properties, compounds of the invention have been found to exhibit potent binding to mu opioid receptors and little or no agonism in mu receptor functional assays. Therefore, the compounds of the invention are potent mu opioid receptor antagonists. Further, compounds of the invention have demonstrated predominantly peripheral activity as compared with central nervous system activity in animal models. Therefore, these compounds can be expected to reverse opioid-induced reductions in GI motility without interfering with the beneficial central effects of analgesia. These properties, as well as the utility of the compounds of the invention, can be demonstrated using various in vitro and in vivo assays well-known to those skilled in the art. Representative assays are described in further detail in the following examples.

Membrane Preparation CHO-K1 (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells stably transfected with human mu opioid or with guinea pig kappa receptor cDNA were grown in medium consisting of Ham's-F12 media supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin-100 μg/mL streptomycin and 800 μg/mL Geneticin in a 5% CO2, humidified incubator @ 37° C. Receptor expression levels (Bmax ˜2.0 and ˜0.414 pmol/mg protein, respectively) were determined using [3H]-Diprenorphine (specific activity ˜50-55 Ci/mmol) in a membrane radioligand binding assay. Cells were grown to 80-95% confluency (<25 subculture passages). For cell line passaging, the cell monolayer was incubated for 5 minutes at room temperature and harvested by mechanical agitation in 10 mL of PBS supplemented with 5 mM EDTA. Following resuspension, cells were transferred to 40 mL fresh growth media for centrifugation for 5 minutes at 1000 rpm and resuspended in fresh growth medium at the appropriate split ratio. For membrane preparation, cells were harvested by gentle mechanical agitation with 5 mM EDTA in PBS followed by centrifugation (2500 g for 5 minutes). The pellets were resuspended in Assay Buffer (50 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-ethanesulfonic acid N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-(2-ethanesulfonic acid) (HEPES)), pH 7.4, and homogenized with a polytron disrupter on ice. The resultant homogenates were centrifuged (1200 g for 5 minutes), the pellets discarded and the supernatant centrifuged (40,000 g for 20 minutes). The pellets were washed once by resuspension in Assay Buffer, followed by an additional centrifugation (40,000 g for 20 minutes). The final pellets were resuspended in Assay Buffer (equivalent 1 T-225 flask/1 mL assay buffer). Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad Bradford Protein Assay kit and membranes were stored in frozen aliquots at −80° C., until required. Human delta opioid receptor (hDOP) membranes were purchased from Perkin Elmer. The reported Kd and Bmax for these membranes determined by saturation analyses in a [3H]-Natrindole radioligand binding assays were 0.14 nM (pKd=9.85) and 2.2 pmol/mg protein, respectively. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad Bradford Protein Assay kit. Membranes were stored in frozen aliquots at −80° C., until required. b. Radioligand Binding Assays Radioligand binding assays were performed in an Axygen 1.1 mL deep well 96-well polypropylene assay plate in a total assay volume of 200 μL containing the appropriate amount of membrane protein (˜3, ˜2 and ˜20 μg for mu, delta and kappa, respectively) in Assay Buffer, supplemented with 0.025% bovine serum albumin (BSA). Saturation binding studies for determination of Kd values of the radioligand were performed using [3H]-Diprenorphine at 8-12 different concentrations ranging from 0.001 nM-5 nM. Displacement assays for determination of pKi values of compounds were performed with [3H]-Diprenorphine at 0.5, 1.2, and 0.7 nM for mu, delta, and kappa, respectively, and eleven concentrations of compound ranging from 10 pM-100 μM. Binding data were analyzed by nonlinear regression analysis with the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.) using the 3-parameter model for one-site competition. The curve minimum was fixed to the value for nonspecific binding, as determined in the presence of 10 μM naloxone. Ki values for test compounds were calculated, in Prism, from the best fit IC50 values, and the Kd value of the radioligand, using the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Ki=IC50/(1+([L]/Kd)) where [L]=the concentration of [3H]-Diprenorphine. Results are expressed as the negative decadic logarithm of the Ki values, pKi. Test compounds having a higher pKi value in these assays have a higher binding affinity for the mu, delta, or kappa opioid receptor. The compounds of Examples 1-26 were tested in these assays. All of the compounds had a pKi value between about 8.4 and about 10.7 at the human mu opioid receptor. For example, the compounds of Examples 1, 2, and 6 had pKi values of 10.0, 10.0, and 9.6, respectively. Compounds of the invention also exhibited pKi values between about 7.5 and about 10.2 at the human delta and guinea pig kappa opioid receptors. Assay 2: Agonist Mediated Activation of the Mu-Opioid Receptor in Membranes Prepared from CHO-K1 Cells Expressing the Human Mu-Opioid Receptor. In this assay, the potency and intrinsic activity values of test compounds were determined by measuring the amount of bound [35S]GTPγS present following receptor activation in membranes prepared from CHO-K1 cells expressing the human mu opioid receptor. a. Mu Opioid Receptor Membrane Preparation: Human mu opioid receptor (hMOP) membranes were either prepared as described above or were purchased from Perkin Elmer. The reported pkd and Bmax for the purchased membranes determined by saturation analyses in a [3H]-Diprenorphine radioligand binding assays was 10.06 and 2.4 pmol/mg protein, respectively. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad Bradford Protein Assay kit. Membranes were stored in frozen aliquots at −80° C., until required. b. Human Mu [35S]GTPγS Nucleotide Exchange Assay Membranes were prepared as described above, and prior to the start of the assay, aliquots were diluted to a concentration of 200 μg/mL in Assay Buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 at 25° C.), then homogenized for 10 seconds using a Polytron homogenizer. Test compounds were received as 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO, diluted to 400 μM into Assay Buffer containing 0.1% BSA, and serial (1:5) dilutions then made to generate ten concentrations of compound ranging from 40 pM-80 μM. GDP and [35S]GTPγS were diluted to 40 μM and 0.4 nM, respectively, in Assay Buffer. The assay was performed in a total volume of 200 μl containing 10 μg of membrane protein, test compound ranging from 10 pM-20 μM), 10 μM GDP, and 0.1 nM [35S]GTPγS diluted in 10 mM MgCl2, 25 mM NaCl, and 0.0125% BSA (final assay concentrations). A DAMGO (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-(methyl)Phe-Gly-ol) concentration-response curve (ranging from 12.8 pM-1 μM) was included on every plate. Assay plates were prepared immediately prior to assay following the addition of 50 μL of the NaCl/MgCl2/GDP solution, 50 μL of test compound, and 50 μL of [35S]GTPγS. The assay was initiated by the addition of 50 μL of membrane protein and allowed to incubate for 30 minutes at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by filtration onto 96-well GF/B filter plates, pre-blocked with 0.3% polyethylenimine, using a Packard Filtermate harvester, and wash with ice-cold Assay Buffer (3×200 μl). Plates are dried overnight prior to determination of counts bound via liquid scintillation on a Packard Topcount instrument. Vehicle: DMSO not to exceed 1% final assay concentration. The amount of bound [35S]GTPγS is proportional to the degree of activation of the mu opioid receptors by the test compound. The intrinsic activity (IA), expressed as a percentage, was determined as the ratio of the amount of bound [35S]GTPγS observed for activation by the test compound to the amount observed for activation by DAMGO which is presumed to be a full agonist (IA=100). The compounds of the invention tested in this assay demonstrated intrinsic activities of less than about 10. For example, the compounds of Examples 1, 3, and 6 had IA values of −1, −4, and 9, respectively. Thus, the compounds of the present invention have been shown to act as antagonists at the human mu opioid receptor. Assay 3: Rat Model of In Vivo Efficacy In this assay the efficacy of test compounds was evaluated in a model of gastrointestinal transit, which evaluates peripheral activity. This study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Theravance, Inc. and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the National Academy of Sciences (©1996). a. Rat Gastric Emptying Assay Test compounds were evaluated in the rat gastric emptying assay to determine their ability to reverse loperamide-induced delayed gastric emptying. Rats were fasted up overnight prior to administration of test compounds or vehicle by intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular or oral routes of administration at doses ranging from 0.001 to about 30 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg). The administration of test compound was followed by subcutaneous administration of loperamide at a dose of 1 mg/kg or vehicle. Five minutes post loperamide or vehicle administration, a non-nutritive, non-absorbable charcoal meal was administered via oral gavage and animals were allowed free access to water for the sixty minute duration of the experiment. Animals were then euthanized via carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed by thoracotomy and the stomach was carefully excised. The stomach was ligated at the lower esophageal sphincter and the pyloric sphincter to prevent additional emptying during tissue removal. Gastric weight was then determined after removal of the ligatures. b. Data Analysis and Results Data was analyzed using the GraphPad Prism Software package (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.). Percent reversal curves were constructed by non-linear regression analysis using the sigmoidal dose response (variable slope) model and best-fit ID50 values were calculated. Curve minima and maxima were fixed to loperamide control values (indicating 0% reversal) and vehicle controls (indicating 100% reversal), respectively. Results are expressed as ID50, the dose required for 50% reversal of the effects of loperamide, in milligrams per kilogram. The compounds of Examples 1, 4, and 6 administered orally, exhibited ID50 values of 0.11 mg/kg, 0.014 mg/kg. and 0.42 mg/kg, respectively in the gastric emptying model.
