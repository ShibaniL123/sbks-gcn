FIELD OF INVENTION The invention relates to a method of lubricating an internal combustion engine by lubricating the engine with the lubricating composition comprising a heterocyclic compound as antiwear and/or extreme pressure agent. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Engine manufacturers have focused on improving engine design in order to improve fuel economy and efficiency (typically, based on Federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards) and reduce wear. Whilst improvements in engine design and operation have contributed, improved formulation of engine oil lubricant may also reduce wear whilst improving fuel economy and efficiency. They also serve to reduce the friction between sliding moving parts (typically metallic or ceramic) that are in contact. It is well known for lubricating oils to contain a number of additives (including antiwear agents, antioxidants, dispersants, or detergents) used to protect internal combustion engines from wear, oxidation, soot deposits and acid build up. A common antiwear additive for engine lubricating oils is zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP). It is believed that ZDDP antiwear additives protect the engine by forming a protective film on metal surfaces. ZDDP may have a detrimental impact on fuel economy and efficiency. Consequently, engine lubricants may also contain a friction modifier to obviate any detrimental impact of ZDDP on fuel economy and efficiency. Both ZDDP and friction modifier function by adsorption on sliding surfaces, and each may interfere with each other's respective functions. Further, engine lubricants containing phosphorus compounds and sulphur have been shown to contribute in part to particulate emissions and emissions of other pollutants. In addition, sulphur and phosphorus tend to poison the catalysts used in catalytic converters, resulting in a reduction in performance of said catalysts. With increasing control of emissions (typically to reduce NOx formation, SOx formation, formation of sulphated ash) there is a desire towards reduced amounts of sulphur, phosphorus and sulphated ash in engine oils. The phosphorus from ZDDP is also believed to be relatively volatile and with the coming introduction of the GF-5 specification, tighter limits on emissions of phosphorus may be required. However, reducing the levels of antiwear additives such as ZDDP is likely to increase wear and result in other detrimental performance of an engine. In addition, as technology develops, components of an engine are exposed to more severe operating conditions. Operating conditions may include higher power density engines, use of turbo chargers, use of alternative fuels and the like. Under many severe operating conditions, wear and/or oxidation of lubricant and components occurs more readily. US Patent 4,840,741 discloses antiwear additives derived from pyridines, pyrimidines, pryazines, pyridazines and/or fused derivatives thereof. The antiwear agents are also functionalised with at least one member of the group consisting of halogens, chloromethyl, dichloromethyl, trichloro-methyl, chlorobromomethyl, bromomethyl, dibromomethyl, cyano, isocyano, methyl-cyano, cyanomethyl, cyanate, isocyanate, thiocyanate, isothiocyanate, nitro, nitromethyl, nitroso, formyl, acetyl, methyl carboxylate, methoxy, methylthio, thiol, and disulphide.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a method for lubricating a mechanical device as disclosed above. Typically the mechanical device may be an internal combustion engine. The Heterocycle The heterocycle is a furan. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the heterocycle is capable of forming a 5-membered or 6-membered chelate with a surface (typically a metal (including both ferric and aluminium) based surface) of the engine. The chelate formed is then believed to produce a surface coating that helps with providing antiwear and/or extreme pressure performance. The heterocycle is an aromatic compound represented by the formula: wherein, Y is -O-R4; and R4 is a hydrocarbyl group (typically linear or branched alkyl) containing 6 to 40 carbon atoms. Oils of Lubricating Viscosity The lubricating composition comprises an oil of lubricating viscosity. Such oils include natural and synthetic oils, oil derived from hydrocracking, hydrogenation, and hydrofinishing, unrefined, refined and re-refined oils and mixtures thereof. Unrefined oils are those obtained directly from a natural or synthetic source generally without (or with little) further purification treatment. Refined oils are similar to the unrefined oils except they have been further treated in one or more purification steps to improve one or more properties. Purification techniques are known in the art and include solvent extraction, secondary distillation, acid or base extraction, filtration, percolation and the like. Re-refined oils are also known as reclaimed or reprocessed oils, and are obtained by processes similar to those used to obtain refined oils and often are additionally processed by techniques directed to removal of spent additives and oil breakdown products. Natural oils useful in making the inventive lubricants include animal oils, vegetable oils (e.g., castor oil), mineral lubricating oils such as liquid petroleum oils and solvent-treated or acid-treated mineral lubricating oils of the paraffinic, naphthenic or mixed paraffinic-naphthenic types and oils derived from coal or shale or mixtures thereof. Synthetic lubricating oils are useful and include hydrocarbon oils such as polymerised and interpolymerised olefins (typically hydrogenated) (e.g., polybutylenes, polypropylenes, propyleneisobutylene copolymers); poly(1-hexenes), poly(1-octenes), poly(1-decenes), and mixtures thereof; alkylbenzenes (e.g. dodecylbenzenes, tetradecylbenzenes, dinonylbenzenes, di-(2-ethylhexyl)-benzenes); polyphenyls (e.g., biphenyls, terphenyls, alkylated polyphenyls); diphenyl alkanes, alkylated diphenyl alkanes, alkylated diphenyl ethers and alkylated diphenyl sulphides and the derivatives, analogs and homologs thereof or mixtures thereof. Other synthetic lubricating oils include polyol esters (such as Prolube®3970), diesters, liquid esters of phosphorus-containing acids (e.g., tricresyl phosphate, trioctyl phosphate, and the diethyl ester of decane phosphonic acid), or polymeric tetrahydrofurans. Synthetic oils may be produced by Fischer-Tropsch reactions and typically may be hydroisomerised Fischer-Tropsch hydrocarbons or waxes. In one embodiment oils may be prepared by a Fischer-Tropsch gas-to-liquid synthetic procedure as well as other gas-to-liquid oils. Oils of lubricating viscosity may also be defined as specified in the American Petroleum Institute (API) Base Oil Interchangeability Guidelines. The five base oil groups are as follows: Group I (sulphur content >0.03 wt %, and/or <90 wt % saturates, viscosity index 80-120); Group II (sulphur content ≤0.03 wt %, and ≥90 wt % saturates, viscosity index 80-120); Group III (sulphur content ≤0.03 wt %, and ≥90 wt % saturates, viscosity index ≥120); Group IV (all polyalphaolefins (PAOs)); and Group V (all others not included in Groups I, II, III, or IV). The oil of lubricating viscosity includes an API Group I, Group II, Group III, Group IV, Group V oil or mixtures thereof. Often the oil of lubricating viscosity is an API Group I, Group II, Group III, Group IV oil or mixtures thereof. The amount of the oil of lubricating viscosity present is typically the balance remaining after subtracting from 100 wt % the sum of the amount of the compound of the invention and the other performance additives. The lubricating composition may be in the form of a concentrate and/or a fully formulated lubricant. If the lubricating composition of the invention (comprising the additives disclosed hereinabove) is in the form of a concentrate (which may be combined with additional oil to form, in whole or in part, a finished lubricant), the ratio of the of these additives to the oil of lubricating viscosity and/or to diluent oil include the ranges of 1:99 to 99:1 by weight, or 10:90 to 80:20 by weight. Other Performance Additives The composition optionally includes other performance additives. The other performance additives comprise at least one of metal deactivators, viscosity modifiers, detergents, friction modifiers, antiwear agents (other than the compounds of the present invention), corrosion inhibitors, dispersants, dispersant viscosity modifiers, extreme pressure agents, antioxidants, foam inhibitors, demulsifiers, pour point depressants, seal swelling agents and mixtures thereof. Typically, fully-formulated lubricating oil will contain one or more of these performance additives.

When the lubricating composition is not lubricating a 2-stroke marine diesel engine the detergent or detergents may be present (on an oil free basis, i.e., an actives basis) at 0 wt % to 10 wt %, or 0.1 wt % to 8 wt %, or 1 wt % to 4 wt % of the lubricating composition. When the lubricating composition is lubricating a 2-stroke marine diesel engine the amount of detergent or detergents (on an oil free basis i.e., an actives basis) may be 0 wt % to 40 wt %, or 2 wt % to 35 wt %, or 5 wt % to 30 wt % of the lubricating composition. Dispersants Dispersants are often known as ashless-type dispersants because, prior to mixing in a lubricating oil composition, they do not contain ash-forming metals and they do not normally contribute any ash forming metals when added to a lubricant and polymeric dispersants. Ashless type dispersants are characterised by a polar group attached to a relatively high molecular weight hydrocarbon chain. Typical ashless dispersants include N-substituted long chain alkenyl succinimides. Examples of N-substituted long chain alkenyl succinimides include polyisobutylene succinimide derived from polyisobutylene with number average molecular weight in the range 350 to 5000, or 500 to 3000.

The lubricating compositions 1 to 31 are then treated with 1 wt % of each antiwear heterocyclic compound prepared above to create lubricating compositions containing the compounds of the invention. Lubricating composition LC1 is derived from lubricant 1 (see Table 1) containing 1 wt % of the product of examples 1 (EX1). Lubricating compositions LC2 is derived from lubricant 2 (see Table 1) containing 1 wt % of the product of examples 1 (EX1). Lubricants 3 to 30 (from Tables 1 to 5) are treated with containing 1 wt % of the product of example 1 (EX1) to form LC3 to LC30. Lubricating composition LC31 is derived from lubricant 31 containing 1 wt % of the product of examples 1 (EX1). Lubricant 32 is a SAE 5W-30 engine oil formulation containing, among other components, 570 ppm of phosphorus derived from zinc dialkyldithiophosphate, 7.9 wt % of succinimide dispersants (including about 31 wt % of diluent oil), 1.48 wt % of a mixture of calcium sulphonate overbased detergent, calcium phenate overbased detergent and calcium salicylate overbased detergent (total detergents containing about 42 wt % of diluent oil), 0.5 wt % of a mixture of aminic antioxidants (typically composed of nonyldiphenylamine and di-nonyldiphenylamine), and 3.0 wt % of a hindered phenol antioxidant as described in the detailed description. Comparative Example 1 (CE1) is a lubricant the same as LC1, except no heterocyclic antiwear agent is present. Test 1: Cameron Plint Wear Test The Cameron Plint TE-77™ is a reciprocating wear tester. In this test a steel ball upper specimen is reciprocated against a steel flat lower specimen. The Cameron Plint is charged with 10 ml of sample and heated to 50°C and held for 1 minute. The sample is then subject to a load of 100N over two minutes while at the same time the reciprocation is started at 10 Hz over 15mm stroke length. The sample is then heated to 250°C at 3°C per minute. At the end of the test the average diameter of the wear scar (in micrometers) on the ball (measured in the X and Y directions) is measured using a calibrated microscope. The results obtained are as follows. Table 6ExampleWear Scar (micrometres)Film Thickness (%)Friction CoefficientCE192427.10.159LC153266.80.1284Footnote: The results reported in Table 6 relate to wear scars obtained for a ferric engine component. Similar trends may be observed for the remaining lubricating compositions. Overall the results obtained for the heterocyclic compounds of the present invention indicate that the compounds have antiwear and/or extreme pressure performance in a lubricating composition. The trends above apply to engines containing components with ferric and/or aluminium surfaces lubricated by an engine oil. It is known that some of the materials described above may interact in the final formulation, so that the components of the final formulation may be different from those that are initially added. The products formed thereby, including the products formed upon employing lubricating composition of the present invention in its intended use, may not be susceptible of easy description. Nevertheless, all such modifications and reaction products are included within the scope of the present invention; the present invention encompasses lubricating composition prepared by admixing the components described above. Except in the Examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numerical quantities in this description specifying amounts of materials, reaction conditions, molecular weights, number of carbon atoms, and the like, are to be understood as modified by the word "about." Unless otherwise indicated, each chemical or composition referred to herein should be interpreted as being a commercial grade material which may contain the isomers, by-products, derivatives, and other such materials which are normally understood to be present in the commercial grade. However, the amount of each chemical component is presented exclusive of any solvent or diluent oil, which may be customarily present in the commercial material, unless otherwise indicated. It is to be understood that the upper and lower amount, range, and ratio limits set forth herein may be independently combined. Similarly, the ranges and amounts for each element of the invention may be used together with ranges or amounts for any of the other elements. Multiple groups represented by the same symbol in the formulae described above, may be the same or different. As used herein, the term "hydrocarbyl substituent" or "hydrocarbyl group" is used in its ordinary sense, which is well-known to those skilled in the art. Specifically, it refers to a group having a carbon atom directly attached to the remainder of the molecule and having predominantly hydrocarbon character. Examples of hydrocarbyl groups include: (i) hydrocarbon substituents, that is, aliphatic (e.g., alkyl or alkenyl), alicyclic (e.g., cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl) substituents, and aromatic-, aliphatic-, and alicyclic-substituted aromatic substituents, as well as cyclic substituents wherein the ring is completed through another portion of the molecule (e.g., two substituents together form a ring);(ii) substituted hydrocarbon substituents, that is, substituents containing non-hydrocarbon groups which, in the context of this invention, do not alter the predominantly hydrocarbon nature of the substituent (e.g., halo (especially chloro and fluoro), hydroxy, alkoxy, mercapto, alkylmercapto, nitro, nitroso, and sulphoxy);(iii) hetero substituents, that is, substituents which, while having a predominantly hydrocarbon character, in the context of this invention, contain other than carbon in a ring or chain otherwise composed of carbon atoms, and encompass substituents as pyridyl, furyl, thienyl and imidazolyl; and(iv) heteroatoms, including sulphur, oxygen, and nitrogen. In general, no more than two, preferably no more than one, non-hydrocarbon substituent will be present for every ten carbon atoms in the hydrocarbyl group; typically, there will be no non-hydrocarbon substituents in the hydrocarbyl group. While the invention has been explained in relation to its preferred embodiments, it is to be understood that various modifications thereof will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the specification. Therefore, it is to be understood that the invention disclosed herein is intended to cover such modifications as fall within the scope of the appended claims.
