DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SOME EMBODIMENTS Overview [0055] Embodiments disclosed herein relate to systems and methods of treating a wound with reduced pressure. As is used herein, reduced or negative pressure levels, such as -X mmHg, represent pressure levels relative to normal ambient atmospheric pressure, which can correspond to 760 mmHg (or 1 atm, 29.93 inHg, 101.325 kPa, 14.696 psi, etc.). Accordingly, a negative pressure value of -X mmHg reflects absolute pressure that is X mmHg below 760 mmHg or, in other words, an absolute pressure of (760-Χ) mmHg. In addition, negative pressure that is “less” or “smaller” than X mmHg corresponds to pressure that is closer to atmospheric pressure (e.g., -40 mmHg is less than -60 mmHg). Negative pressure that is “more” or “greater” than -X mmHg corresponds to pressure that is further from atmospheric pressure (e.g., -80 mmHg is more than -60 mmHg). In some embodiments, local ambient atmospheric pressure is used as a reference point, and such local atmospheric pressure may not necessarily be, for example, 760 mmHg. [0056] Embodiments of the present invention are generally applicable to use in topical negative pressure (“TNP”) or reduced or negative pressure therapy systems. Briefly, negative pressure wound therapy assists in the closure and healing of many forms of “hard to heal” wounds by reducing tissue oedema, encouraging blood flow and granular tissue formation, and/or removing excess exudate and can reduce bacterial load (and thus infection risk). In addition, the therapy allows for less disturbance of a wound leading to more rapid healing. TNP therapy systems can also assist in the healing of surgically closed wounds by removing fluid. In some embodiments, TNP therapy helps to stabilize the tissue in the apposed position of closure. A further beneficial use of TNP therapy can be found in grafts and flaps where removal of excess fluid is important and close proximity of the graft to tissue is required in order to ensure tissue viability. [0057] In some embodiments, the pump assembly can include one or more processors or controllers responsible for various system functions associated with various levels of responsiveness, such as interfacing with a user (e.g., patient, physician, nurse, etc.), controlling a negative pressure pump, providing network connectivity, and the like. In some embodiments, levels of responsiveness can correspond to or be associated with levels of risk. For example, controlling a source of negative pressure may be classified as a high risk activity, as delivery of therapy is important for patient safety, healing, etc. Accordingly, controlling the source of negative pressure can be associated with a high level of responsiveness. The pump assembly can also include one or more input/output devices for receiving and providing data. These devices can include screens, touchscreens, buttons, knobs, ports, and the like. The pump assembly can be configured to present graphical user interface (GUI) screens for controlling and monitoring the operation of the TNP system. [0058] In some embodiments, the TNP system can be configured to determine and monitor flow of fluid in the system. This can be accomplished by using one or more pressure transducers or sensors that measure pressure in a fluid flow path and provide feedback to a controller. In various embodiments, determining of fluid flow can be accomplished by utilizing one or more of the following techniques: monitoring the speed of a pump motor, monitoring flow of fluid in a portion of a fluid flow path by placing a calibrated fluid flow restrictor, and monitoring one or more characteristics, such as amplitude, frequency, or slope of detected pressure pulses. Calculated flow rate can be used to determine whether desired therapy is delivered to a patient, whether there are one or more leaks present in the system, and the like. [0059] In some embodiments, the system can be configured to provide indication, alarms, etc. reflecting operating conditions to a user. The system can include visual, audible, tactile, and other types of indicators and/or alarms configured to signal to the user various operating conditions. Such conditions include system on/off, standby, pause, normal operation, dressing problem, leak, error, and the like. The indicators and/or alarms can include speakers, displays, light sources, etc., and/or combinations thereof. In various embodiments, indications, alarms, etc. are guided by one or more applicable standards. [0060] In certain embodiments, a pump assembly can include one or more communications processors for providing external connectivity. Such connectivity can be used for various activities, such as location tracking of the pump assembly, compliance monitoring, tracking of operational parameters, remote selection and adjustment of therapy settings, and the like. Connectivity can include Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, cellular connectivity (e.g., 2G, 3G, LTE, 4G), WiFi connectivity, Internet connectivity, and the like. In some embodiments, wired connectivity can be utilized. In various embodiments, the pump assembly can communicate data to a cloud and receive data from the cloud. The data can include location data, compliance monitoring data, operational parameters, data for remote selection and adjustment of therapy settings, and the like. [0061] Embodiments of the present invention relate to attachment systems for mounting an apparatus or device, including but not limited to a negative pressure wound therapy (“NPWT”) apparatus. In some embodiments, an attachment system includes a cradle configured to be removably attached to the apparatus. The attachment system includes a first clamp arm attached to the cradle and a second clamp arm. The second clamp arm can be configured to be moved between an unclamped position and a clamped position in which the first and second clamp arms are configured to be substantially securely attached to a structure. In the unclamped position, the first and second arms can be configured to not be attached to the structure. The structure can include any suitable structure for mounting the apparatus (e.g., medical apparatus), such as an IV pole, bedrail, and the like. The attachment system also includes a first screw engaged with a second screw which can be configured to move the second arm between the clamped and unclamped positions. The second screw can be attached to a handle. The threads of the first and second screws can be opposite pitch such that a single handle rotation provides double or substantially double linear motion as compared to using one screw. For example, in one embodiment approximately four rotations of the handle are needed to move the second clamp arm between a fully closed position in which the first and second clamp arms are not separated or substantially not separated (e.g., are in contact) and a fully open position in which the first and second clamp arms are separated by a maximum distance from each other. As a result, the attachment system can be used to efficiently and securely attach the apparatus to structures of varying thickness. Negative Pressure System [0062] Figure 1 illustrates an embodiment of a negative or reduced pressure wound treatment (or ΤΝΡ or NPWT) system 100 comprising a wound filler 130 placed inside a wound cavity 110, the wound cavity sealed by a wound cover 120. The wound filler 130 in combination with the wound cover 120 can be referred to as wound dressing. A single or multi lumen tube or conduit 140 is connected the wound cover 120 with a pump assembly or NPWT apparatus 150 configured to supply reduced pressure. The wound cover 120 can be in fluidic communication with the wound cavity 110. In any of the system embodiments disclosed herein, as in the embodiment illustrated in Figure 1, the pump assembly can be a canisterless pump assembly (meaning that exudate is collected in the wound dressing or is transferred via tube 140 for collection to another location). Flowever, any of the pump assembly embodiments disclosed herein can be configured to include or support a canister. Additionally, in any of the system embodiments disclosed herein, any of the pump assembly embodiments can be mounted to or supported by the dressing, or adjacent to the dressing. The wound filler 130 can be any suitable type, such as hydrophilic or hydrophobic foam, gauze, inflatable bag, and so on. The wound filler 130 can be conformable to the wound cavity 110 such that it substantially fills the cavity. The wound cover 120 can provide a substantially fluid impermeable seal over the wound cavity 110. In some embodiments, the wound cover 120 has a top side and a bottom side, and the bottom side adhesively (or in any other suitable manner) seals with wound cavity 110. The conduit 140 or any other conduit disclosed herein can be formed from polyurethane, PVC, nylon, polyethylene, silicone, or any other suitable material. [0063] Some embodiments of the wound cover 120 can have a port (not shown) configured to receive an end of the conduit 140. In some embodiments, the conduit 140 can otherwise pass through and/or under the wound cover 120 to supply reduced pressure to the wound cavity 110 so as to maintain a desired level of reduced pressure in the wound cavity. The conduit 140 can be any suitable article configured to provide at least a substantially sealed fluid flow pathway between the pump assembly 150 and the wound cover 120, so as to supply the reduced pressure provided by the pump assembly 150 to wound cavity 110. [0064] The wound cover 120 and the wound filler 130 can be provided as a single article or an integrated single unit. In some embodiments, no wound filler is provided and the wound cover by itself may be considered the wound dressing. The wound dressing may then be connected, via the conduit 140, to a source of negative pressure, such as the pump assembly 150. In some embodiments, though not required, the pump assembly 150 can be miniaturized and portable, although larger conventional pumps such can also be used. [0065] The wound cover 120 can be located over a wound site to be treated. The wound cover 120 can form a substantially sealed cavity or enclosure over the wound site. In some embodiments, the wound cover 120 can be configured to have a film having a high water vapour permeability to enable the evaporation of surplus fluid, and can have a superabsorbing material contained therein to safely absorb wound exudate. It will be appreciated that throughout this specification reference is made to a wound. In this sense it is to be understood that the term wound is to be broadly construed and encompasses open and closed wounds in which skin is tom, cut or punctured or where trauma causes a contusion, or any other surficial or other conditions or imperfections on the skin of a patient or otherwise that benefit from reduced pressure treatment. A wound is thus broadly defined as any damaged region of tissue where fluid may or may not be produced. Examples of such wounds include, but are not limited to, acute wounds, chronic wounds, surgical incisions and other incisions, subacute and dehisced wounds, traumatic wounds, flaps and skin grafts, lacerations, abrasions, contusions, burns, diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, stoma, surgical wounds, trauma and venous ulcers or the like. In some embodiments, the components of the ΤΝΡ system described herein can be particularly suited for incisional wounds that exude a small amount of wound exudate. [0066] Some embodiments of the system are designed to operate without the use of an exudate canister. Some embodiments can be configured to support an exudate canister. In some embodiments, configuring the pump assembly 150 and tubing 140 so that the tubing 140 can be quickly and easily removed from the pump assembly 150 can facilitate or improve the process of dressing or pump changes, if necessary. Any of the pump embodiments disclosed herein can be configured to have any suitable connection between the tubing and the pump. [0067] In some embodiments, the pump assembly 150 can be configured to deliver negative pressure of approximately -80 mmHg, or between about -20 mmHg and 200 mmHg. Note that these pressures are relative to normal ambient atmospheric pressure thus, -200 mmHg would be about 560 mmHg in practical terms. In some embodiments, the pressure range can be between about -40 mmHg and -150 mmHg. Alternatively a pressure range of up to -75 mmHg, up to -80 mmHg or over -80 mmHg can be used. Also in other embodiments a pressure range of below -75 mmHg can be used. Alternatively a pressure range of over approximately -100 mmHg, or even -150 mmHg, can be supplied by the pump assembly 150. [0068] In some embodiments, the pump assembly 150 is configured to provide continuous or intermittent negative pressure therapy. Continuous therapy can be delivered at above -25 mmHg, -25 mmHg, -40 mmHg, -50 mmHg, -60 mmHg, -70 mmHg, -80 mmHg, 90 mmHg, -100 mmHg, -120 mmHg, -140 mmHg, -160 mmHg, -180 mmHg, -200 mmHg, or below -200 mmHg. Intermittent therapy can be delivered between low and high negative pressure set points. Low set point can be set at above 0 mmHg, 0 mmHg, -25 mmHg, -40 mmHg, -50 mmHg, -60 mmHg, -70 mmHg, -80 mmHg, -90 mmHg, -100 mmHg, -120 mmHg, -140 mmHg, -160 mmHg, -180 mmHg, or below -180 mmHg. High set point can be set at above -25 mmHg, -40 mmHg, -50 mmHg, -60 mmHg, -70 mmHg, -80 mmHg, -90 mmHg, -100 mmHg, -120 mmHg, -140 mmHg, -160 mmHg, -180 mmHg, -200 mmHg, or below -200 mmHg. During intermittent therapy, negative pressure at low set point can be delivered for a first time duration, and upon expiration of the first time duration, negative pressure at high set point can be delivered for a second time duration. Upon expiration of the second time duration, negative pressure at low set point can be delivered. The first and second time durations can be same or different values. The first and second durations can be selected from the following range: less than 2 minutes, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 4 minutes, 6 minutes, 8 minutes, 10 minutes, or greater than 10 minutes. In some embodiments, switching between low and high set points and vice versa can be performed according to a step waveform, square waveform, sinusoidal waveform, and the like. [0069] In operation, the wound filler 130 is inserted into the wound cavity 110 and wound cover 120 is placed so as to seal the wound cavity 110. The pump assembly 150 provides a source of a negative pressure to the wound cover 120, which is transmitted to the wound cavity 110 via the wound filler 130. Fluid (e.g., wound exudate) is drawn through the conduit 140, and can be stored in a canister. In some embodiments, fluid is absorbed by the wound filler 130 or one or more absorbent layers (not shown). [0070] Wound dressings that may be utilized with the pump assembly and other embodiments of the present application include Renasys-F, Renasys-G, Renasys ΑΒ, and Pico Dressings available from Smith & Nephew. Further description of such wound dressings and other components of a negative pressure wound therapy system that may be used with the pump assembly and other embodiments of the present application are found in U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2012/0116334, 2011/0213287, 2011/0282309, 2012/0136325 and 2013/0110058, which are incorporated by reference in their entirety. In other embodiments, other suitable wound dressings can be utilized.

Button 212b can be configured as a play/pause button for the delivery of negative pressure therapy. For example, pressing the button 212b can cause therapy to start, and pressing the button 212b afterward can cause therapy to pause or end. Button 212c can be configured to lock the display 206 and/or the buttons 212. For instance, button 212c can be pressed so that the user does not unintentionally alter the delivery of the therapy. Button 212c can be depressed to unlock the controls. In other embodiments, additional buttons can be used or one or more of the illustrated buttons 212a, 212b, or 212c can be omitted. In some embodiments, multiple key presses and/or sequences of key presses can be used to operate the pump assembly 230. [0074] The pump assembly 230 includes one or more latch recesses 222 formed in the cover. In the illustrated embodiment, two latch recesses 222 can be formed on the sides of the pump assembly 230. The latch recesses 222 can be configured to allow attachment and detachment of the canister 220 using one or more canister latches 221. The pump assembly 230 comprises an air outlet 224 for allowing air removed from the wound cavity 110 to escape. Air entering the pump assembly can be passed through one or more suitable filters (described below, such as in Figure 10), such as antibacterial filters. This can maintain reusability of the pump assembly. The pump assembly 230 includes one or more mounts 226 for connecting a carry strap to the pump assembly 230 or for attaching a cradle. In the illustrated embodiment, two mounts 226 can be formed on the sides of the pump assembly 230. In some embodiments, various of these features are omitted and/or various additional features are added to the pump assembly 230. [0075] The canister 220 is configured to hold fluid (e.g., exudate) removed from the wound cavity 110. The canister 220 includes one or more latches 221 for attaching the canister to the pump assembly 230. In the illustrated embodiment, the canister 220 comprises two latches 221 on the sides of the canister.

[0080] Figure 2D illustrates a schematic front view 230D and rear view 230D’ of a pump assembly 200D according to some embodiments. [0081] Figure 2Ε illustrates a view 200Ε of the interior components of the pump assembly 230 according to some embodiments. The pump assembly 230 can include various components, such as a canister connector 252 which includes a sealing ring 253, control printed circuit board (PCB) 260, peripherals PCB 262 (e.g., for USB connectivity), power supply PCB 264, vacuum pump 266, power supply 268 (e.g., rechargeable battery), speaker 270, and light guide or pipe 272 (e.g., for status indication using guided light emitted by one or more LEDs). Further details of status indication are provided in U.S. Patent No. 8,294,586, which is assigned to the assignee of the present application and is incorporated by reference in its entirety. Other components can be included, such as electrical cables, connectors, tubing, valves, fdters, fasteners, screws, holders, and so on. In some embodiments, the pump assembly 230 can comprise alternative or additional components. [0082] Figure 2F illustrates another view 200F of the interior components of the pump assembly 230 according to some embodiments. As is explained below, the pump assembly 230 includes an antenna 276. The connector 252 between the vacuum pump 266 and the canister 220 includes a flow restrictor 278. As is explained below, the flow restrictor 278 can be a calibrated flow restrictor used for measuring flow in the fluid flow path and for determining various operating conditions, such as leaks, blockages, high pressure (over-vacuum), and the like. In some embodiments, flow across the restrictor 278 can be determined by measuring a pressure differential (or pressure drop) across the flow restrictor. In various embodiments, flow across the restrictor 278 can be characterized as high flow (e.g., due to a leak), low flow (e.g., due to a blockage or canister being full), normal flow, etc. As is illustrated, pressure sensor 284 measures pressure upstream (or on the canister side) of the flow restrictor 278. Pressure sensor 284 can be an electronic pressure sensor mounted on the control PCB 264. Conduit or lumen 286 can connect the upstream side of the flow restrictor 278 with the pressure sensor 284. Pressure sensors 280 and 282 measure pressure downstream (or on the vacuum pump side) of the flow restrictor 278. Pressure sensors 280 and 282 can be electronic pressure sensors mounted on the control PCB 264. Conduit or lumen 288 can connect the downstream side of the flow restrictor 278 with the pressure sensors 280 and 284 via a Y-connector 289. [0083] In some embodiments, one of pressure sensors 280 and 282 can be designated as a primary pressure sensor and the other as a backup pressure sensor in case the primary pressure sensor becomes defective or inoperative. For example, pressure sensor 280 can be the primary pressure sensor and pressure sensor 282 can be the backup pressure sensor. Pressure drop across the flow restrictor 278 can be determined by subtracting pressure measured by sensor 280 and sensor 284. If pressure sensor 280 fails, pressure drop across the flow restrictor can be determined by subtracting pressure measured by sensor 282 and sensor 284. In certain embodiments, the backup pressure sensor can be used for monitoring and indicating high pressure conditions, that is when the pressure in the flow path exceeds a maximum pressure threshold. In some embodiments, one or more differential pressure sensors can be used. For example, a differential pressure sensor connected to the upstream and downstream sides of the flow restrictor 278 can measure the pressure drop across the flow restrictor. In some embodiments, one or more of these components, such as the flow restrictor 278, are omitted and/or additional components, such as one or more flow meters, are used.

Additional details of the carrying bag are provided in U.S. Patent No. 8,240,470, which is assigned to the assignee of the present application and is incorporated by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the pump assembly 230 and/or canister 220 includes a clip for attaching the pump assembly to a patient’s belt, pocket, etc. Attachment System [0095] Figures 13Α-13Β illustrate an attachment system 1300 according to some embodiments. In operation, the attachment system 1300 is used to mount a device or apparatus to any suitable structure, such as an IV pole (e.g., an IV pole having a diameter between 0.75 inches and 2.0 inches), a bedrail (e.g., a bedrail having a width between 0.75 inches and 3 inches), and the like. The attachment system 1300 can be used to mount to the structure any suitable device, such as a medical treatment device, including but not limited to NPWT apparatus or device. The attachment system 1300 can be configured to be adjustable so that a secure connection can be made efficiently. As is illustrated in Figure 13A, the attachment system 1300 includes a cradle 1310, which attaches to the device, and a clamp 1330. The clamp 1330 is adjustable for secure attachment to various structures. In the illustrated embodiment, the width of the clamp 1330 is adjusted by turning a knob 1334. In some embodiments, the cradle 1310 attaches to the device by placing a mount 226 (see Figures 2Α-2Β) into a recess 1302 and activating a closure 1318. The closure 1318 can be a latch, lock, or any other suitable mechanism for attaching the device to the cradle 1310. The cradle 1310 can include one or more closures 1318, such as two closures on each side of the cradle. [0096] The attachment system 1300 attaches to a structure, such as a pole, rail, or the like by turning the knob 1334 so that a portion of the structure is secured in the space between the first and second clamp arms as described below. The device can be removed from the cradle 1310 by deactivating the one or more closures 1318. For example, the one or more closures 1318 can be released or unlocked (e.g., by pressing) to allow detachment of the device from the cradle 1310. The attachment system 1300 is configured to be attached to structures of various thickness. For example, the attachment system 1300 can be attached to a thin pole or tube as well as to a thick bedrail. [0097] Figure 13Β illustrates an exploded view of the attachment system 1300 according to some embodiments As is illustrated in Figure 13Β, the cradle 1310 includes a cradle housing 1312 and first lead screw 1314. The screw 1314 can be positioned insider the cradle housing 1312 and can be allowed to freely rotate inside the housing 1312. The cradle 1310 also comprises a left closure 1316 and right closure 1318 for attaching the cradle to the device (e.g., NPWT apparatus 230). The cradle 1310 further includes non the device-facing side a bumper 1320, which can be made out of rubber. The cradle 1310 also includes a pin 1322, which can be a coiled spring, screws 1324, and washers 1326 for attaching the closures 1316 and 1318 to the cradle. The clamp 1330 includes a first clamp arm 1331, second clamp arm 1332, a second screw 1335 to which a handle 1334 is attached, and a cap 1336 configured to be attached to the handle 1334. Pads 1338, such as a rubber pads, are configured to be attached to the first and second clamp arms 1331 and 1332. The second clamp arm 1332 includes an opening 1333 for placing the second screw 1335. The opening 1333 can include interior threading configured to engage with the threading of the second screw 1335. The second screw 1335 can include a hollow interior tunnel portion for engaging with the first screw 1314. The interior portion of the second screw 1335 can include threading configured to engage with the threading of the first screw 1314. In other embodiments, the second screw 1335 is attached to the second clamp arm 1332 using any other suitable attachment. [0098] In some embodiments, in operation the cradle 1310 is attached to the device (e.g., apparatus 230). Rear of the device 230 can rest against the bumper 1320 when the cradle 1310 is attached. In some embodiments, recess(es) 1302 and/or closure(s) 1318 can be configured such that the cradle 1310 can be attached to the device only in a configuration in which the rear of the device rests against the bumper 1320. Attaching the device incorrectly, such as backwards so that the front of the deice rests against the bumper 1320, is not be allowed. The attachment system 1300 attaches to a structure, such as pole, rail, or the like, by turning the knob 1334 so that a portion of the structure is placed in between the first and second clamp arms 1331 and 1332. This is accomplished by action of the first and second screws 1314 and 1335 moving the second clamp arm 1332 to a desired distance from the first clamp arm 1331 (which is stationary). The knob 1334 is then turned to securely mount the device onto the structure. Dismounting is performed by turning to knob 1334 to remove the device from the structure. The cradle can be disconnected from the device by unlatching or unlocking the closure(s) 1318. [0099] Figure 13C illustrates an attachment system 2100 according to some embodiments. The attachment system 2100 can be used to mount to a structure any suitable device, such as a medical treatment device, including but not limited to NPWT apparatus or device 230. The attachment system 210 includes a cradle 2110, first clamp arm 2140, and second clamp arm 2150. The first clamp arm 2140 is attached or connected to the cradle 2110, and thereby remains stationary when the attachment is in operation. The second clamp arm 2150 moves with respect to the first clamp arm 2140, which varies the gap between the first and second cradle arms. Structure is secured between the first and second cradle arms 2140 and 2150. The structure can be thin, such as pole 2190’, or thick, such as pole or rail 2190. [0100] The attachment system 2100 includes first and second screws 2160 and 2170. Second screw 2170 is connected to a knob 2134. In operation, turning the knob 2170 causes the first and second screws 2160 and 2170 to cause the second clamp arm 2150 to move linearly in smooth and uniform manner with respect to the first clamp arm 2140. The second clamp arm 2150 moves from a clamped position in which the device is mounted to the structure and an unclamped position in which the device is not mounted to the structure. The second clamp arm 2150 also moves between a fully closed position in which the first and second clamp arms 2140 and 2150 are not separated or substantially not separated (e.g., are in contact with each other) and a fully open position in which the first and second clamp arms 2140 and 2150 are separated by a maximum distance from each other. This maximum distance places an upper limit on the maximum thickness of the structure to which the device can be attached using the attachment system 2100. Movement of the second clamp arm 2150 is illustrated in views 2100Α, 2100Β, and 2100C. In view 2100Α, the first and second clamp arms 2140 and 2150 are located close to each other. In views 2100Β and 2100C, the gap between the first and second clamp arms 2140 and 2150 widens. That is, the second clamp arm 2150 is moved farther away from the first clamp arm 2140, such as by turning the knob 2134. [0101] The first screw 2160 can be located within or substantially within a housing of the cradle, and the first screw 2160 can be allowed to freely rotate inside the housing. The first screw 2160 has a thread with a lead (distance along the screw’s axis that is covered by η℮ complete rotation of the screw) and a pitch (distance from the crest of one thread to the next). In one embodiment, the lead and pitch of the first screw are the same. The second screw 2170 has a thread with a lead and a pitch, which may be the same in one embodiment. The threads of the first and second screws 2160 and 2170 can be square, Acme, buttress, and the like. In some embodiments, the first and second screws 2160 and 2170 have threads of the same type, such as Acme threads. In some embodiments, the first and second screws 2160 and 2170 have threads of different type. The second screw 2170 can be connected or attached to the second clamp arm 2150, such as via an opening 1333 illustrated in Figure 13Β. [0102] In some embodiments, the thread of the first screw 2160 and the thread of the second screw 2170 can be oriented in opposite directions (or opposite pitch). For example, the thread of the first screw 2160 can be right-handed while the thread of the second screw 2170 can be left-handed and vice versa. When first and second screws 2160 and 2170 with threads oriented in opposite directions are engaged with one another, a single rotation of the handle 2134 provides double or substantially double linear movement as opposed to using a single screw. The first and second screws 2160 and 2170 can be engaged by the second screw 2170 having a hollow opening configured to receive at least a portion of the first screw 2160. As is illustrated in Figure 13Β, the hollow opening can have interior thread configured to be engaged with the thread of the first screw 2160. In some embodiments, the first screw 2160 can include a hollow opening configured to receive at least a part of the second screw 2170. In other embodiments, first and second screws 2160 and 2170 are engaged in any suitable way, such as via using a nut. [0103] In some embodiments, such dual-screw arrangement allows for quick mounting to structures of various thickness and while maintaining good control over the tightness (or security) of the attachment to the structure. For example, between about 4 and 10 rotations of the handle are needed to change the configuration of first and second clamp arms 2140 and 2150 from fully closed position to fully open position and vice versa. In some embodiments, a nominal clamping force of the attachment to the structure is approximately 20-30 pound force (lbf) is achieved. The maximum clamping force before part failure can be approximately 100 lbf. Torque required to achieve nominal clamping can be less than about 20 inch pound force (inlb). In other embodiments, other suitable clamping forces, maximum clamping forces, and nominal clamping torques can be used. The dual-screw arrangement can be more durable and cheaper than alternative arrangements, such as using a single screw with steep pitch thread, using a single screw with multi-start threads, and the like. [0104] In some embodiments, the first and second screws 2160 and 2170 are power screws configured to transform rotary motion into linear motion. Power screws are described in a document titled “Power Screws,” which is accessible at http://www.roymech.co.uk/Usefiil Tables/Cams Springs/Power Screws.html. Efficiency of power screws is described in a document titled “Power Screw Equations,” which is accessible at http://www.roymech.co.uk/Useful Tables/Cams Springs/Power Screws l.html. Power screw strength analysis is provided in a document titled “Strength Considerations for Power Screws,” which is accessible at http://www.roymech.co.uk/Useful Tables/Cams Springs/Power Screws 2.html. Each of these documents is incorporated by reference in their entirety. [0105] In some embodiments, the cradle 2110, first and second clamp arms 2140 and 2150, and knob 2134 are made out of plastic material, thereby making the attachment system 2100 lightweight. In some embodiments, one or more of other attachment parts described herein is also made of plastic material. In some embodiments, the first clamp arm is not configured to be stationary while the second clam arm is configured to be stationary. In some embodiments, the first and second clamp arms are non-stationary. In some embodiments, handle is not used. [0106] Figures 13D-13J illustrate an attachment system according to some embodiments. The attachment system 2200 can be used to mount to a structure any suitable device, such as a medical treatment device, including but not limited to NPWT apparatus or device. Figure 13D illustrates a perspective view of the attachment system in a closed or almost closed position. Figure 13Ε illustrates a front view of the attachment system illustrated in Figure 13D. Figure 13F illustrates a rear view of the attachment system illustrated in Figure 13D. Figure 13G illustrates a right side view of the attachment system illustrated in Figure 13D. Figure 13Η illustrates a left side view of the attachment system illustrated in Figure 13D. Figure 131 illustrates a top view of the attachment system illustrated in Figure 13D. Figure 13J illustrates a bottom view of the attachment system illustrated in Figure 13D. As is illustrated, the attachment system 2200 includes one or more protrusions or projections 2210 which can be used for securing one or more items, such as carry straps, carrying cases or bags, etc. [0107] Figure 13Κ illustrates attachment systems in operation according to some embodiments. As is illustrated in 2300Α, an apparatus (e.g., NPWT apparatus 230) is mounted to an IV pole using an attachment system according to some embodiments. As is illustrated in 2300Β, the apparatus is mounted to a bed rail using an attachment system according to some embodiments. Attachment systems illustrated in Figure 13Κ may be selected from any one of attachment systems 1300, 2100, or 2200. Electronics and Software [0108] Figure 14 illustrates an electrical component schematic 1400 of a pump assembly according to some embodiments. Electrical components can operate to accept user input, provide output to the user, operate the pump assembly and the ΤΝΡ system, provide network connectivity, and so on. Electrical components can be mounted on one or more PCBs, such as the control PCB 260, peripherals PCB 262, and/or power supply PCB 264. As is illustrated, the pump assembly 230 can include multiple processors. It may be advantageous to utilize multiple processors in order to allocate or assign various tasks to different processors. In some embodiments, a first processor can be responsible for user activity and a second processor can be responsible for controlling the pump. This way, the activity of controlling the pump, which may necessitate a higher level of responsiveness (corresponding to higher risk level), can be offloaded to a dedicated processor and, thereby, will not be interrupted by user interface tasks, which may take longer to complete because of interactions with the user. [0109] The pump assembly 230 can comprise a user interface processor or controller 1410 configured to operate one or more components for accepting user input and providing output to the user, such as the display 206, buttons 212, etc. Input to the pump assembly 230 and output from the pump assembly can controlled by an input/output (I/O) module 1420. For example, the I/O module can receive data from one or more ports, such as serial, parallel, hybrid ports, and the like. The processor 1410 also receives data from and provides data to one or more expansion modules 1460, such as one or more USB ports, SD ports, Compact Disc (CD) drives, DVD drives, FireWire ports, Thunderbolt ports, PCI Express ports, and the like. The processor 1410, along with other controllers or processors, stores data in one or more memory modules 1450, which can be internal and/or external to the processor 1410. Any suitable type of memory can be used, including volatile and/or ηοηvolatile memory, such as RAM, ROM, magnetic memory, solid-state memory, Magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM), and the like. [0110] In some embodiments, the processor 1410 can be a general purpose controller, such as a low-power processor. In other embodiments, the processor 1410 can be an application specific processor. In some embodiments, the processor 1410 can be configured as a “central” processor in the electronic architecture of the pump assembly 230, and the processor 1410 can coordinate the activity of other processors, such as a pump control processor 1470, communications processor 1430, and one or more additional processors 1480. The processor 1410 can run a suitable operating system, such as a Linux, Windows CE, VxWorks, etc. [0111] The pump control processor 1470 can be configured to control the operation of a negative pressure pump 1490. The pump 1490 can be a suitable pump, such as a diaphragm pump, peristaltic pump, rotary pump, rotary vane pump, scroll pump, screw pump, liquid ring pump, diaphragm pump operated by a piezoelectric transducer, voice coil pump, and the like. In some embodiments, the pump control processor 1470 can measure pressure in a fluid flow path, using data received from one or more pressure sensors, calculate the rate of fluid flow, and control the pump. In some embodiments, the pump control processor 1470 controls the pump motor so that a desired level of negative pressure in achieved in the wound cavity 110. The desired level of negative pressure can be pressure set or selected by the user. In various embodiments, the pump control processor 1470 controls the pump (e.g., pump motor) using pulse-width modulation (PWM). A control signal for driving the pump can be a 0-100% duty cycle PWM signal. The pump control processor 1470 can perform flow rate calculations and detect alarms. The pump control processor 1470 can communicate information to the processor 1410. The pump control processor 1470 can include internal memory and/or can utilize memory 1450. The pump control processor 1470 can be a low-power processor. [0112] A communications processor 1430 can be configured to provide wired and/or wireless connectivity. The communications processor 1430 can utilize one or more antennas 1440 (such as antenna 276) for sending and receiving data. In some embodiments, the communications processor 1430 can provide one or more of the following types of connections: Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, cellular connectivity (e.g., 2G, 3G, LTE, 4G), WiFi connectivity, Internet connectivity, and the like. Connectivity can be used for various activities, such as pump assembly location tracking, asset tracking, compliance monitoring, remote selection, uploading of logs, alarms, and other operational data, and adjustment of therapy settings, upgrading of software and/or firmware, and the like. In some embodiments, the communications processor 1430 can provide dual GPS/cellular functionality. Cellular functionality can, for example, be 3G functionality. In such cases, if the GPS module is not be able to establish satellite connection due to various factors including atmospheric conditions, building or terrain interference, satellite geometry, and so on, the device location can be determined using the 3G network connection, such as by using cell identification, triangulation, forward link timing, and the like. In some embodiments, the pump assembly 230 can include a SIM card, and SIM-based positional information can be obtained. [0113] The communications processor 1430 can communicate information to the processor 1410. The communications processor 1430 can include internal memory and/or can utilize memory 1450. The communications processor 1430 can be a low-power processor. [0114] In some embodiments, the pump assembly 230 can store data illustrated in Table 1. This data can be stored, for example, in memory 1450. In various embodiments, different or additional data can be stored by the pump assembly 230. In some embodiments, location information can be acquired by GPS or any other suitable method, such as cellular triangulation, cell identification forward link timing, and the like.

[0145] Figure 17R illustrates alarm screens 1700R according to some embodiments. For example, during therapy delivery the device can detect high vacuum condition (e.g., high levels of vacuum are being applied to the wound cavity 110). The device can display a high vacuum alarm as is shown in the left screen of Figure 17R indicting that high vacuum was detected while delivering therapy (information bar 1822). Because in certain embodiments such alarm cannot be silenced, therapy is paused, as is indicated by information bar 1822 shown on the right screen in Figure 17R. This screen is displayed after the user presses therapy pause button 212b as prompted by the screen on the left side of Figure 17R. User can troubleshoot the system by selecting control 1820. If troubleshooting is successfully perform (e.g., leak is mitigated or eliminated), the device can display screen 1700Τ of Figure 17Τ, and user can restart delivery of therapy. [0146] Figure 17S illustrates alarm screens 1700S according to certain embodiments. A low battery alarm is illustrated.

[0148] Figure 18 illustrates a process 1850 of operating a device according to some embodiments. The process 1850 can be executed by the processor 1410. In block 1852, the process 1850 provides GUI screens to the user. In block 1854, the process 1850 receives input from the user. In block 1856, the process 1856 performs one or more operations in accordance with input received from the user. Flow Rate Monitoring [0149] Some embodiments of the system monitor and/or determine a rate of flow of fluid in the system. In certain embodiments, flow rate monitoring can be performed by the pump control processor 1470 alone or in combination with the processor 1410. Monitoring the flow rate can be used, among other things, to ensure that therapy is properly delivered to the wound, to detect blockages, canister full conditions, and/or leaks in the fluid flow path, high pressure, ensure that the flow rate is not unsafe (e.g., dangerously high), etc. [0150] In some embodiments, the system performs flow rate monitoring by measuring and/or monitoring speed of vacuum pump motor, such as, by using a tachometer. The pump control processor 1470 can continuously monitor voltage and/or current at which the pump is being driven using the tachometer feedback from the pump. Tachometer feedback can be used to determine the pump speed. If pump speed falls below a threshold value over a particular period of time, such as 2 minutes, it can be determined that a blockage is present in the flow path. The blockage can be due to a blockage in a tube or lumen, canister being full, etc. An alarm can be triggered and the system can wait for the user to take one or more actions to resolve the blockage. [0151] In various embodiments, tachometer can be read periodically, such as every 100 msec, and periodic readings made over a time duration, such as 32 sec, can be combined (e.g., averaged). Combined tachometer readings can be used for leak detection, blockage detection, limiting the maximum flow rate, etc. Combined tachometer readings (e.g., in counts) can be converted to a flow rate (e.g., in mL/min) using one or more conversion equations and/or tables so that a current flow rate is determined. In some embodiments, the flow rate is determined according to the following equation: [0152] FR = Ci *F*P + C2 [0153] where FR is the flow rate, F is the frequency of the pump tachometer signal, Ρ is pressure produced by the pump, and C/ and Cj are suitable constants. The determined flow rate can be compared to various flow rate thresholds, such as blockage threshold, leakage threshold, and maximum flow rate threshold, to determine a presence of a particular condition, such as a blockage, leakage, over-vacuum. [0154] In some embodiments, a blockage condition is detected when the determined flow rate falls below a blockage threshold. A blockage alarm can be enabled if the blockage condition is present for a period of time, such as 30 seconds. The blockage alarm can be disabled when the determined flow rate exceeds the blockage threshold. In some embodiments, the system can differentiate between a blockage in a tube or lumen and canister full conditions. In some embodiments, a leakage condition is detected when the determined flow rate exceeds a leakage threshold. A leakage alarm can be enabled if the leakage condition is present for a period of time, such as 30 seconds. The leakage alarm can be disabled when the detected flow rate exceeds the leakage threshold. In some embodiments, in order to prevent an over-vacuum condition, a maximum flow rate is imposed, such as 1.6 liters/min. Pump drive signal, such as voltage or current signal, can be limited not exceed this flow rate threshold. [0155] In certain embodiments, one or more pressure sensors can be placed in suitable locations in the fluid flow path. Pressure measured by the one or more sensors is provided to the system (e.g., pump control processor 1470) so that it can determine and adjust the pump drive signal to achieve a desired negative pressure level. The pump drive signal can be generated using PWM. Additional details of flow rate detection and pump control are provided in U.S. Patent Application No. 13/589,021, which is assigned to the assignee of the present application is incorporated by reference in its entirety. [0156] In some embodiments, flow rate monitoring is performed by measuring flow through a flow restrictor placed in a portion of the fluid flow path. In certain embodiments, flow restrictor 278 illustrated in Figure 2F can be used. The flow restrictor can be calibrated such that it can be used to reliably monitor flow rate for different types of wounds, dressings, and operating conditions. For example, a high precision silicon flow restrictor can be used. The flow restrictor can be located at any suitable location in the flow path, such as between the source of the negative pressure and the canister, such as upstream of the source of the negative pressure and downstream of the canister. A differential pressure sensor or two pressure sensors can be used to measure a pressure drop across the flow restrictor. For example, as explained above in connection with Figure 2F, the pressure drop across the flow restrictor 278 can be measured using sensors 282 and 284. In certain embodiments, if the pressure drop falls below a pressure differential threshold, which indicates low flow, the measured flow rate is compared to a flow rate threshold. If the measured flow rate falls below the flow rate threshold, blockage condition is detected. Additional details of blockage detection are provided in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2011/0071483, which is assigned to the assignee of the present application is incorporated by reference in its entirety. In some embodiments, the measured flow rate is compared to a leakage threshold. If the measured flow rate exceeds the leakage threshold, a leak is detected. Additional details of leakage detection are provided in U.S. Patent No. 8,308,714, which is assigned to a subsidiary of the assignee of the present application and is incorporated by reference in its entirety. [0157] In some embodiments, blockages and presence of fluid in one or more tubes or lumens are detected by processing data from one or more pressure sensors, such as sensors 280, 282, and 284. This detection can be enhanced by changing one or more settings of the vacuum pump, such as increasing vacuum level delivered by the pump, decreasing the vacuum level, stopping the pump, changing the pump speed, changing a cadence of the pump, and the like. In some embodiments, as the pump operates, it generates pressure pulses that are propagated through the fluid flow path. The pressure pulses are illustrated in the pressure curve 1902 of Figure 19Α according to some embodiments. Region 1904 illustrates pressure pulses detected during normal operation of the system, and region 1906 illustrates pressure pulses detected when canister becomes full. As is illustrated, canister blockage causes a reduced volume to be seen upstream of the canister, and the amplitude of the pressure pulses increases. In certain embodiments, this change or “bounce” in the pressure pulse signal can be magnified or enhanced by varying the pump speed, varying the cadence of the pump, such as by adjusting PWM parameters, and the like. Such adjustments of pump operation can be performed over a short time duration and the changes can be small such that the operation of the system remains relatively unaffected. [0158] In some embodiments, the increase in the amplitude of pressure pulses (region 1906) can be detected and compared to a blockage threshold in order to determine whether a blockage condition exists. In certain embodiments, the frequency, rate of change of the amplitude (or slope), rate of change of the frequency, etc. of the pressure pulse signal can be monitored in place of or in addition to monitoring the amplitude. For example, curve 1910 of Figure 19Β illustrates pressure sensed by a pressure sensor downstream of the canister filter. As is shown, small or no pressure pulses are detected when the canister filter becomes blocked. A large negative change in the detected pressure signal is observed, as is illustrated by the slope 1912. In some embodiments, signal processing techniques can be utilized, such as converting the detected pressure pulse signal into frequency domain, for example by using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and analyzing the pressure pulse signal in the frequency domain. Additional details of flow rate detection are described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2012/0078539, which is assigned to the assignee of the present application is incorporated by reference in its entirety. [0159] In some embodiments, temporary blockages caused by slugs of fluid in tubes or lumens are detected by turning off the pump and monitoring the pressure change in the fluid flow path. The pump can be turned off for a short duration of time as to not affect the operation of the system. Presence of temporary blockages in the system due to slugs of fluid can cause vacuum level to decline in a discontinuous “stair and risers” pattern, such as that illustrated by curve 2002 of Figure 20. This discontinuous decaying pattern is due to slugs of fluid moving through the fluid flow path and arriving at the canister inlet, which can suddenly change the volume seen by the pressure sensor (and the pump). When slugs of fluid are not present, a more continuous decaying pattern, such as illustrated in curve 2004, is observed. In certain embodiments, when the pattern illustrated in curve 2002 is detected, the system can increase the level of vacuum produced by the pump to clear the slugs. [0160] In some embodiments, one or more flow sensors and/or flow meters can be used to directly measure the fluid flow. In some embodiments, the system can utilize one or more of the above flow rate monitoring techniques. The system can be configured to suitably arbitrate between flow rates determined using multiple flow rate monitoring techniques if one or more such techniques are executed in parallel. In certain embodiments, the system execute one of the techniques, such as the flow rate determination based on the pump speed, and utilize one or more other techniques as needed. In various embodiments, the system can utilize one or more other techniques in cases the determine flow rate is perceived to be inaccurate or unreliable.
