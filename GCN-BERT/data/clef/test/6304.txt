BACKGROUND Tray tables are commonly used to provide commercial airline and other vehicle passengers with a surface for eating, drinking, working, and for convenient placement of items to be accessed during transit. Conventional aircraft and commercial vehicles arrange passenger seating in rows. Tray tables for use by the passengers are typically designed to have a single tray table surface that is connected to a framework that allows the tray table surface to be rotated upward and downward. The tray table is typically stowed in an upright position against the seat backs in front of the passengers. To use the tray table, a passenger will unlatch the tray table and rotate it downwards into a horizontal position so that the tray table surface creates a tabletop directly in front of the passenger, or even partially over the passenger's lap. When the passenger is finished with the tray table, the tray table may be rotated upward and returned to the stowed position. While this conventional design is useful, it creates an inconvenient obstruction to other passengers, and even to a passenger using a tray table, during ingress and egress of the seat rows. For example, an airline passenger sitting in a window seat may need to exit the seat row to use a restroom or retrieve a personal item from an overhead bin. If a passenger in the middle seat is using a tray table, then that passenger would need to pick up the items from the tray table surface and stow the tray table in order to allow the window passenger to pass. This act may need to be repeated when the window passenger returns. There is currently no room within a seat row for a person to pass between a tray table that is in use and the passenger using the tray table. It is with respect to these considerations and others that the disclosure made herein is presented. SUMMARY It should be appreciated that this Summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary is not intended to be used to limit the scope of the claimed subject matter. Apparatus and methods described herein provide for a configurable tray table and a method for using the configurable tray table. According to one aspect, a configurable tray table may include a support assembly and a tray assembly. The support assembly may be configured for connection to a structure. The tray assembly may be coupled to the support assembly and may be configured to provide a coplanar tray configuration and a multi-planar tray configuration. The tray assembly may include a number of tray table segments that are each pivotally coupled to an adjacent tray table segments. According to another aspect, a method for configuring a tray table may include rotating a first tray table segment around a hinged longitudinal edge. The hinged longitudinal edge may be coupled with a second tray table segment. Rotating the first tray table segment may transition the tray table from a coplanar tray configuration with a substantially flat tray surface to a multi-planar tray configuration. According to yet another aspect, a configurable tray table assembly may include a support assembly configured for connection to a structure and a tray assembly connected to the support assembly. The tray assembly may include three tray table segments. The first tray table segment may be pivotally coupled to the second tray table segment, which may be pivotally coupled to the third tray table segment. The three tray table segments may be configurable to provide a stowed configuration, a small table configuration, a full table configuration, and a folded configuration. The features, functions, and advantages that have been discussed can be achieved independently in various embodiments of the present disclosure or may be combined in yet other embodiments, further details of which can be seen with reference to the following description and drawings.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The following detailed description is directed to a configurable tray table and corresponding use. As discussed above, conventional tray tables offer a single tray table surface that substantially occupies an entire space between a seated passenger and the seat back in front of the passenger when in use. The relatively large tray table surface associated with conventional tray tables is useful during meals or situations in which a maximum amount of surface space is desired for placing items, but is cumbersome and problematic for ingress and egress within the seat row. In particular, there are often times at which a passenger utilizes a tray table for a single drink or to support a single book, electronic reader, tablet, personal game system, or other device that does not occupy a lot of space. Even in these situations, the user must remove the item, close and latch the tray table, allow a person to ingress or egress the seat row, and then unlatch the tray table, lower it, and replace the item on the tray table surface. This process may then be repeated if the person returns to his or her seat after leaving the row. Utilizing the concepts and technologies described herein, a configurable tray table provides a passenger with multiple configurations depending on the desired use. The disclosure herein describes a tray table that provides a stowed configuration and a full table configuration similar to the stowed and lowered configurations of conventional tray tables. However, embodiments herein also provide a small table configuration and a folded configuration that is not possible with conventional designs. In particular, the small table configuration maintains the configurable tray table in a stowed configuration against a seat back in order to maximize the space between seat rows for ingress and egress, but allows for a segment of the configurable tray table to be rotated away from the stowed tray table to a horizontal position. This small table configuration provides a relatively small tray table surface for placing a drink or small item when the full tray table surface is not needed. Even with the tray table segment positioned in the small table configuration, space is maintained between the small table surface and the passenger for ingress and egress between the seat rows. The folded configuration according to various embodiments of the configurable tray table described below provides an inclined table surface for holding a tablet, electronic reader, smartphone or other personal computing device, electronic gaming device, DVD or other video playback device, book, magazine, documents, or any other applicable material in an inclined position. In contrast, a conventional tray table merely provides a flat table surface, which is useful for eating, but does not facilitate the use of devices and material that are traditionally held upright in a user's hands during use. In the following detailed description, references are made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and which are shown by way of illustration, specific embodiments, or examples. Referring now to the drawings, in which like numerals represent like elements through the several figures, a configurable tray table and method for employing the same according to the various embodiments will be described. FIG. 1 shows a perspective view of a configurable tray table 102 configured in a stowed configuration 104 and a configurable tray table 102 configured in a full table configuration 106. According to various embodiments, the configurable tray table may be described as having two coupled assemblies, a support assembly 110 and a tray assembly 116. The support assembly 110 may include a frame 112 that is attached, or configured for attachment to, a structure 109. The structure 109 may include any component to which the configurable tray table 102 is attached, such as a passenger seat, bulkhead, or other appropriate structure. It should be understood that the configurable tray table 102 is described herein in the context of a passenger aircraft. However, the configurable tray table 102 may be utilized in any environment in which a table surface that may be removed or stowed may be desired, including but not limited to, ships, aircraft, busses, trains, recreational vehicles, theaters, auditoriums, and the like. Accordingly, the structure 109 may include any structural component of a vehicle or building. The support assembly 110 also includes a tray rail 114 that is pivotally coupled to the frame 112. According to the example shown in FIG. 1, each configurable tray table 102 includes two parallel tray rails 114 coupled to opposite sides of the tray assembly 116, although the use of a single tray rail 114 or more than two tray rails 114 for each configurable tray table 102 is contemplated and within the scope of this disclosure. The support assembly 110 is configured with the appropriate structural and mechanical features to allow for the rotation of the frame end 113 of each tray rail 114 with respect to the frame 112, as well as to allow for the engagement and disengagement of the various components of the tray assembly 116 as they rotate with respect to the tray rails 114 as described in further detail below. Moreover, the tray rails 114 may be configured to allow for the translation of the tray assembly 116 forward and aft along a length of the tray rails 114 to allow for some adjustment of the distance of the tray assembly 116 to the passenger or user of the configurable tray table 102. The tray assembly 116 may include any number of tray table segments. According to this embodiment, the tray assembly 116 includes a first tray table segment 118A, a second tray table segment 118B, and a third tray table segment 118C (collectively referred to as “tray table segments 118”). Each tray table segment 118 is pivotally coupled to an adjacent tray table segment 118. For example, the first tray table segment 118A and the second tray table segment 118B share a first hinged longitudinal edge 120A. Similarly, the second tray table segment 118B and the third tray table segment 118C share a second hinged longitudinal edge 120B. The rotation of the tray table segments 118 around the hinged longitudinal edges will be described in greater detail below with respect to the multi-planar configurations of various embodiments. According to various embodiments, the stowed configuration 104 and the full table configuration 106 shown in FIG. 1 are generally referred to as coplanar configurations. Coplanar configurations include all configurations of the tray assembly 116 in which the tray table segments 118 are positioned adjacent and coplanar to one another to create a substantially flat tray surface 108. In other words, the top surfaces of all of the tray table segments are coplanar, creating a flat surface for use as a tray by a passenger, or for efficient low-profile storage against a seat back or structure 109. In the stowed configuration 104, the substantially flat tray surface 108 of the tray assembly 116 is coplanar with the tray rail 114 when the tray rail 114 is in a raised position 124. In contrast, when the substantially flat tray surface 108 is positioned coplanar with the tray rail 114 in a lowered position 126, the configurable tray table 102 is arranged in the full table configuration 106. A cup holder 122, such as a self-leveling cup holder 500 as shown in FIG. 5, may be positioned in one or more tray table segments 118 according to various embodiments. Although the cup holder 122 is shown in FIG. 1 as being positioned in the first tray table segment 118A, it should be appreciated that any tray table segment 118 may contain a cup holder 122 without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Aspects of a self-leveling cup holder 500 will be described in greater detail below with respect to FIG. 5. FIG. 2 shows a perspective view of a configurable tray table 102 in the small table configuration 202. The small table configuration 202 is one of two multi-planar configurations described herein. Multi-planar configurations include all configurations of the tray assembly 116 in which the tray table segments 118 are arranged so that the surfaces of the tray table segments 118 occupy at least two planes. Specifically, two multi-planar configurations will be described, including multiple implementations of the small table configuration 202 with respect to FIGS. 2 and 3, and a folded configuration 402 with respect to FIGS. 4A and 4B. FIG. 2 shows a small table configuration 202 that provides a small table surface 204 that allows a user to place a drink or small item on the configurable tray table 102 while maintaining enough space between the configurable tray table 102 and the user to allow a person to pass between seat rows. According to this embodiment, the configurable tray table 102 is placed in the stowed configuration 104. From the stowed configuration 104, the first tray table segment 118A is rotated outwards and upwards to a substantially horizontal position to create the small table configuration 202 with the small table surface 204. Prior to or during rotation of the first tray table segment 118A, the outer longitudinal edge 206 of the first tray table segment 118A may be uncoupled from the tray rail 114 utilizing the latching mechanism 208. The latching mechanism 208 may be any known structural, mechanical, or magnetic latch capable of securing a tray table segment 118 in a coplanar configuration with the tray rail 114. When uncoupled, the first tray table segment 118A may be rotated around the first hinged longitudinal edge 120A and secured into position to provide the small table surface 204. According to one embodiment, the first tray table segment 118A may be held in the substantially horizontal position using friction cams, mechanical stops, mechanically operated cams, or similar mechanisms. A cup holder, and specifically a cup holder 122 according to one embodiment, may be located within the first tray table segment 118A to provide the user with a cup holder in all tray table configurations. It should be appreciated that a cup holder may be located within any or all of the tray table segments 118 depending on the particular implementation, or to provide the user with various options with respect to all configurations. The cup holder 122 will be described in further detail below. FIG. 3 shows an alternative embodiment of the small table configuration 202. In this embodiment, the third tray table segment 118C is rotated outwards and downwards from the stowed configuration 104 to a substantially horizontal position to create the small table configuration 202 with the small table surface 204. This embodiment is similar to the small table configuration 202 described above with respect to FIG. 2, but would vary the height of the small table surface 204 from the floor as compared to the prior example. Turning now to FIG. 4A, the folded configuration 402 will now be described. As mentioned above, the folded configuration 402 provides an inclined table surface 404 for holding a tablet, electronic reader, smartphone or other personal computing device, electronic gaming device, DVD or other video playback device, book, magazine, documents, or any other applicable material in an inclined position. To transition the configurable tray table 102 to the folded configuration 402, the tray assembly 116 is first placed in the full table configuration 106. From the full table configuration 106, the outer longitudinal edge 206 of the first tray table segment 118A may be uncoupled from the tray rail 114 utilizing the latching mechanism 208 as described above. The first tray table segment 118A is rotated upwards around the first hinged longitudinal edge 120A. The second tray table segment 118B is rotated upwards around the second hinged longitudinal edge 120B. The outer longitudinal edge 206 of the first tray table segment 118A is brought forward until contact is made with the third tray table segment 118C. The first tray table segment 118A may be secured to the third tray table segment 118C via coupling mechanisms 408. Coupling these segments may occur via any number and type of coupling mechanisms 408, including but not limited to, magnets, structural features on the tray table segments 118 that engage one another, a groove or channel within the third tray table segment 118C into which the outer longitudinal edge 206 is positioned, or frictional mechanisms. The first tray table segment 118A may include a device retaining ledge 406 configured as a ridge, projection, or shelf that supports a bottom edge of an item placed on the inclined table surface 404 as seen in FIG. 4B. FIG. 4B shows the configurable tray table 102 in the folded configuration 402 with an electronic tablet device resting on the inclined table surface 404 and device retaining ledge 406. The use of the folded configuration 402 secures items at a favorable viewing angle, freeing the user's hands or allowing for a more relaxed viewing position. It should be appreciated that the configurable tray table 102 may include an alternative mechanism for securing an item to the inclined table surface 404, including but not limited to suction cups, elastic material, or surface material that increases frictional characteristics of the inclined table surface 404. FIG. 5 shows an example of a cup holder 122 configured as a self-leveling cup holder 500. The self-leveling cup holder 500 retains a cup 502 in an upright position regardless of the configuration of the configurable tray table 102. According to one embodiment, the self-leveling cup holder 500 includes a retaining ring 504 that is rotatably secured within a cup holder aperture 506. The cup 502 is placed within the retaining ring 504. Because the cup 502 is free to rotate around axis A, the weight of the contents of the cup maintain the cup 502 in an upright position. The precise size, shape, and configuration of the self-leveling cup holder 500 is not limited to the example shown in FIG. 5. Turning now to FIG. 6, an illustrative routine 600 for configuring a tray table will now be described in detail. It should be appreciated that more or fewer operations may be performed than shown in the figures and described herein. These operations may also be performed in a different order than those described herein. The routine 600 begins at operation 602, where the configurable tray table 102 is positioned in the stowed configuration 104. As described above, to position the configurable tray table 102 in the stowed configuration 104, the tray assembly 116 is configured with a substantially flat tray surface 108 that is coplanar with the tray rails 114. The tray assembly 116 is then raised until the tray rails 114 are substantially coplanar with the frame 112 so that the tray assembly 116 abuts the structure 109. The configurable tray table 102 may then be latched or otherwise secured in the stowed configuration 104. From operation 602, the routine 600 continues to operation 604, where a decision is made as to whether the small table configuration 202 is desired. If the small table configuration 202 is desired, then the routine 600 proceeds to operation 606, where a tray table segment 118 is rotated from the coplanar configuration to the substantially horizontal configuration to create the small table configuration 202. As described and shown above, the tray table segment 118 that is used to provide the small table surface 204 may be either the first tray table segment 118A or the third tray table segment 118B according to alternative embodiments. When the user is finished with the small table configuration 202, the routine 600 returns to operation 602 and proceeds as described above. If, however, at operation 604, the small table configuration 202 is not desired, then the routine 600 continues to operation 608, where the tray assembly 116 is unlatched and rotated downward with the tray rails 114 to a horizontal position to create the full table configuration 106 that provides a substantially flat tray surface 108 for use by the passenger. From operation 608, the routine 600 continues to operation 610, where a decision is made as to whether a folded configuration 402 is desired. If not, then the routine 600 returns to operation 602 and proceeds as described above. However, if at operation 610, a determination that the folded configuration 402 is desired, then the routine 600 continues to operation 612 and the first tray table segment 118A is uncoupled from the tray rails 114 and rotated upward from the full table configuration 106 around the first hinged longitudinal edge 120A. At operation 614, the second tray table segment 118B is also rotated upward around the second hinged longitudinal edge 120B. The routine 600 continues to operation 616, where the outer longitudinal edge 206 of the first tray table segment 118A makes contact with and is coupled to the third tray table segment 118C. As described above, the coupling of the first and third tray table segments may occur through any suitable mechanism, including having the outer longitudinal edge 206 rest on the surface of, or engage with a structural feature of, the third tray table segment 118C. The routine 600 then returns to operation 602 where the configurable tray table 102 is returned to the stowed configuration 104 and the routine 600 repeats as described above. The subject matter described above is provided by way of illustration only and should not be construed as limiting.
