FIELD OF THE INVENTION The invention relates to the hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene to produce 3-pentenenitriles and other unsaturated nitriles. More particularly, this invention relates to a process for the hydrocyanation of 1,3-butadiene using a catalyst precursor composition comprising a zero-valent nickel and at least one multidentate phosphorus-containing ligand. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 3-Pentenenitrile (3PN) is an important intermediate in the production of adiponitrile (ADN). ADN is of particular interest because it is a commercially versatile and important intermediate in the industrial production of nylon polyamides useful in forming films, fibers, and molded articles. It is well known in the art that 3PN may be formed through a series of reactions as illustrated in Equations 1 and 2 below, wherein BD is butadiene, HCN is hydrogen cyanide, and 2M3BN is the BD hydrocyanation co-product 2-methyl-3-butenenitrile. United States Patent No. 3,496,215 describes the catalytic hydrocyanation of BD (equation 1) in the presence of NiL4 complexes wherein L is a monodentate phosphorus containing ligand. The relative amounts of 3PN and 2M3BN can be dependent upon the catalyst utilized in this chemical reaction. United States Patent No. 3,536,748 describes the catalytic isomerization of 2M3BN to 3PN (equation 2) in the presence of NiL4 complexes. United States Patent No. 3,536,748 discloses that in the presence of HCN, the nickel complex preferentially catalyzes formation of undesired, six-carbon, saturated dinitrile (2-methylglutaronitrile, MGN) from 2M3BN (see equation 3 below). This patent notes that, because of the overriding competitive hydrocyanation reaction, for the isomerization of 2M3BN to 3PN it is necessary to avoid the presence of large amounts of HCN, for example any amount of the order of or in excess of 1:1 mole ratio with the 2M3BN starting material. The reference further discloses that HCN has no significant effect per se on the isomerization reaction, its presence in minor amounts in the starting material can be tolerated if necessary, and the isomerization process is preferably conducted in the absence of HCN. United States Patent No. 6,169,198 discloses that hydrocyanation of BD to prepare ADN can generally be divided into three steps. The first is synthesis of mononitriles by hydrocyanation of BD (as in Equation 1 above), for which the selectivity for the linear 3PN is about 70% or less, depending on the catalyst used. The second is isomerization of the 2M3BN present in the mixtures to 3PN (as in Equation 2 above) and isomerization of 3PN to various n-pentenenitriles; the third is synthesis of dinitriles. Also disclosed is a preferred embodiment in which the ratio of the amounts of 3PN to 2M3BN obtained in the monoaddition of HCN onto the BD-containing hydrocarbon mixture is at least 5:1, preferably at least 10:1, in particular at least 20:1, with a catalyst comprising at least one metallocene-phosphorus(III)-nickel(0) complex. The reference further discloses that it is generally possible to dispense with division of the process for preparing ADN into the three steps of monoaddition of HCN onto a BD-containing hydrocarbon mixture; isomerization; addition of HCN onto 4-pentenenitrile (4PN) formed in situ; and the addition of 2 mole equivalents of HCN onto a BD-containing hydrocarbon mixture can be designed as a one-stage process. In recent years, a new class of catalysts has been described for the transformations of Equations 1 and 2. United States Patent Nos. 5,512,695; 5,512,696; 5,523,453; 5,663,369; 5,688,986; 5,693,843; 5,723,641; 5,821,378; 5,959,135; 5,981,772; 6,020,516; 6,127,567; 6,171,996; 6,171,997; WO99/06355; WO96/22968; WO99/06357; and WO99/52632 describe the use of diphosphite and diphosphinite nickel complexes as catalysts for the hydrocyanation of BD or 3PN and the isomerization of 2M3BN to 3PN. In general, this class of catalysts is characterized by greater catalytic activity and resistance to HCN-derived degradation reactions compared to the catalysts comprising nickel complexes of monodentate phosphites and phosphinites. As a result, this new class of catalysts may generally be used effectively at much lower concentrations and over a broader range of reaction conditions. United States Patent Nos. 5,821,378; 5,981,772 and 6,020,516 describe the capability of a limited number of these catalyst systems to isomerize 2M3BN at the same temperature at which BD is hydrocyanated. It would be desirable to have a high yield 3PN process in which BD hydrocyanation and 2M3BN isomerization occur concurrently in the same reaction zone. Such a combined BD hydrocyanation/2M3BN isomerization process would have fewer reaction and process separation steps than a process in which the hydrocyanation and isomerization reactions were performed, for example, in separate reaction zones under reaction conditions optimized independently for BD hydrocyanation or for 2M3BN isomerization to 3PN. The advantages of a combined BD hydrocyanation/2M3BN isomerization process having simplified process complexity could include reduced capital investment and reduced cost of manufacture. Reduced yield loss to undesired by-products, such as MGN and compounds derived from BD dimerization and/or oligomerization, might also be realized with a combined BD hydrocyanation/2M3BN isomerization process.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention provides a process for the continuous production of 3-pentenenitrile in which a HCN-containing feed, a BD-containing feed, and a catalyst precursor composition solution are contacted, for example concurrently, in a reaction zone, for example a continuous-stirred-tank-reactor (CSTR), and a residence time is maintained sufficient to convert about 95% or more of the HCN and to produce a reaction mixture comprising 3PN and 2M3BN, wherein the 2M3BN concentration is maintained below about 15 weight percent of the total mass of the reaction mixture. In another aspect, the process of the invention further comprises optionally contacting a feed comprising 2M3BN in the reaction zone. The 2M3BN in the feed can be produced by a different process or prepared in a separate manufacturing facility. Alternatively, the 2M3BNin the feed may be obtained from a BD hydrocyanation and/or 2M3BN isomerization process as described in the art or the process of the current invention wherein a stream comprising 2M3BN may be, for example, distilled from a higher boiling reaction product comprising 3PN. Such a stream comprising 2M3BN can be recycled to the reaction zone of the present invention in which BD hydrocyanation and 2M3BN isomerization occurs. Potential advantages of such a process can include the elimination of investment and of the associated variable and fixed costs for operating an additional 2M3BN isomerization reaction vessel, distillation columns, and the associated pumps, heat exchangers, piping, and control instrumentation. In processes falling within the scope of the present invention, the hydrocyanation and isomerization reactions of Equations 1 and 2 (above) can be carried out concurrently and continuously in the same reaction zone, for example under high BD and HCN conversion conditions. The catalyst precursor composition comprises a zero-valent nickel and at least one multidentate phosphorus-containing (P-containing) ligand selected from the group consisting of a phosphite, a phosphonite, a phosphinite, a phosphine, and a mixed P-containing ligand or a combination of such members. As used herein, the term "mixed P-containing ligand" means a multidentate phosphorus-containing ligand comprising at least one combination selected from the group consisting of a phosphite-phosphonite, a phosphite-phosphinite, a phosphite-phosphine, a phosphonite-phosphinite, a phosphonite-phosphine, and a phosphinite-phosphine or a combination of such members. The catalyst precursor compositions may further comprise at least one monodentate P-containing ligand selected from the group consisting of a phosphite, a phosphonite, a phosphinite, and a phosphine or a combination of such members, provided that the monodentate P-containing ligand does not detract from the beneficial aspects of the invention. The monodentate P-containing ligand may be present as an impurity from the synthesis of the multidentate P-containing ligand, or the monodentate P-containing ligand may be added as an additional component of the catalyst precursor composition. Each catalyst precursor composition useful in the present invention may be considered a "precursor" composition in that the zero-valent nickel at some point becomes bound to at least one multidentate P-containing ligand, and further in all likelihood, additional reactions occur during hydrocyanation, such as, for example, complexing of the initial catalyst composition to an ethylenically unsaturated compound. As used herein, the term "catalyst precursor composition" also includes within its meaning recycled catalyst, that is, a catalyst precursor composition comprising a zero-valent nickel and at least one multidentate P-containing ligand which, having been used in the process of the invention, is returned or may be returned to the process and used again. The term "hydrocarbyl" is well known in the art and designates a hydrocarbon molecule from which at least one hydrogen atom has been removed.

These references also disclose methods for preparing multidentate ligands of Formula I. Further examples of the multidentate P-containing ligand include a bidentate phosphite ligand selected from a member of the group represented by Formulas II and III, in which all like reference characters have the same meaning, except as further explicitly limited: wherein R1 and R5 are independently selected from the group consisting of C1 to C5 hydrocarbyl, and R2, R3, R4, R6, R7 and R8 are independently selected from the group consisting of H and C1 to C4 hydrocarbyl. It will be recognized that Formula II and Formula III are two dimensional representations of three-dimensional molecules and that rotation about chemical bonds can occur in the molecules to give configurations differing from those shown. For example, rotation about the carbon-carbon bond between the 2- and 2'- positions of the biphenyl and octahydrobinaphthyl bridging groups of Formula II and Formula III, respectively, can bring the two phosphorus atoms of each Formula in closer proximity to one another and can allow the phosphite ligand to bind to a single nickel atom in a bidentate fashion. The term "bidentate" is well known in the art and means both phosphorus atoms of the ligand are bonded to a single nickel atom. For example, the multidentate P-containing ligand can be selected from a member of the group represented by Formulas II and III, wherein R1 is methyl, ethyl, isopropyl or cyclopentyl; R2 is H or methyl; R3 is H or a C1 to C4 hydrocarbyl; R4 is H or methyl; R5 is methyl, ethyl or isopropyl; and R6, R7 and R8 are independently selected from the group consisting of H and C1 to C4 hydrocarbyl. As additional examples, the multidentate P-containing ligand can be selected from a member of the group represented by Formula II, wherein R1, R4, and R5 are methyl; R2, R6, R7 and R8 are H; and R3 is a C1 to C4 hydrocarbyl; or R1 is isopropyl; R2 is H; R3 is a C1 to C4 hydrocarbyl; R4 is H or methyl; R5 is methyl or ethyl; R6 and R8 are H or methyl; and R7 is H, methyl or tertiary-butyl; or the multidentate P-containing ligand can be selected from a member of the group represented by Formula III, wherein R1 is isopropyl or cyclopentyl; R5 is methyl or isopropyl; and R6, R7, and R8 are H. As yet another example, the multidentate P-containing ligand can be represented by Formula II, wherein R1 is isopropyl; R2, R6, and R8 are H; and R3, R4, R5, and R7 are methyl. The multidentate P-containing ligand may also be a polymeric ligand composition, as disclosed, for example, in United States Patent No. 6,284,865; United States Patent No. 6,924,345, or United States Published Patent Application No. 2003/135014. Methods for preparing such polymeric ligand compositions are well known in the art and are disclosed, for example, in the above cited references. The catalyst precursor compositions may further comprise at least one monodentate P-containing ligand selected from the group consisting of a phosphite, a phosphonite, a phosphinite, and a phosphine or a combination of such members. The monodentate P-containing ligand may be added as an additional component of the catalyst precursor composition, or it may be present, for example, as an impurity from the synthesis of the multidentate P-containing ligand. The monodentate P-containing ligand may be represented by Formula IV P(X1R31)(X2R32)(X3R33) Formula IV wherein X1, X2, X3 independently represent oxygen or a single bond, andR31, R32, R33 independently represent identical or different, single or bridged organic radicals. It is to be understood that Formula IV may be a single compound or a mixture of different compounds having the indicated structure. In one embodiment, all of the groups X1, X2, and X3 may represent oxygen, so that Formula IV represents a phosphite of formula P(OR31)(OR32)(OR33), wherein R31, R32, and R33 have the meanings defined herein. If one of the groups X1, X2, and X3 represents a single bond and two groups represent oxygen, Formula IV represents a phosphonite of formula P(OR31)(OR32)(R33), P(R31)(OR32)(OR33), or P(OR31)(R32)(OR33), wherein R31, R32, and R33 have the meanings defined herein.

In one embodiment, the catalyst precursor composition may comprise a zero-valent nickel, at least one multidentate P-containing ligand selected from the group consisting of a phosphite, a phosphonite, a phosphinite, a phosphine, and a mixed P-containing ligand or a combination of such members, and at least one monodentate P-containing ligand selected from tritolyl phosphite and phosphites of Formula IVb P(OR31)x(OR32)y(OR33)z(OR34)p Formula IVb wherein R31, R32, and R33 are independently selected from o-isopropylphenyl, m-tolyl, and p-tolyl, R34 is phenyl, x is 1 or 2, and y, z, p are independently 0, 1, or 2, provided that x+y+z+p = 3; and mixtures thereof. A multidentate P-containing ligand may be suitable for use in the process of the invention if, as part of a catalyst precursor composition comprising a zero-valent nickel and the multidentate P-containing ligand, it can be used within a temperature range of 80 °C to 140 °C, to produce a reaction mixture comprising 3PN and 2M3BN from a HCN-containing feed and a BD-containing feed. The multidentate P-containing ligand is suitable for use in the process of the invention in the case where the 2M3BN concentration of the reaction mixture comprising 3PN and 2M3BN can be maintained below 15 weight percent of the total mass of the reaction mixture, for example at or below 10 weight percent of the total mass of the reaction mixture, and the HCN conversion is 95% or more. A catalyst precursor composition, comprising a P-containing ligand suitable for the process of the invention, may lack sufficient 3PN selectivity in BD hydrocyanation to produce a reaction mixture comprising 3PN and 2M3BN wherein the 2M3BN concentration is maintained below about 15 weight percent of the total mass of the reaction mixture. However, when used to hydrocyanate BD and to isomerize 2M3BN to 3PN concurrently in the same reaction zone, with a sufficient residence time, a catalyst precursor composition comprising a suitable P-containing ligand can produce a reaction mixture comprising 3PN and 2M3BN wherein the 2M3BN concentration is maintained below about 15 weight percent of the total mass of the reaction mixture. For the concurrent BD hydrocyanation/2M3BN isomerization process with a suitable multidentate P-containing ligand, the molar ratio of the HCN in the feed to the BD in the feed is in the range of 0.90:1.00 to 1.04:1.00. The molar ratio of the zero-valent nickel in the feed to the BD in the feed is in the range of 0.00005:1.00 to 0.0050:1.00. The mole ratio of multidentate P-containing ligand to zero-valent nickel is in the range of about 1/1 to about 6/1. Solvent, HCN, preparation of the catalyst precursor composition, reactor startup, and other operational information are as described for the process of the invention in other sections of this document. The multidentate P-containing ligands useful in the catalyst precursor compositions employed in the present invention may be prepared by any suitable synthetic means known in the art, for example as described in at least some of the references cited as disclosing examples of multidentate P-containing ligands. For example, the multidentate P-containing ligands of Formula II and Formula III may be synthesized as described in United States Patent Nos. 6,171,996 and 5,512,696, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. For example, the reaction of two equivalents of an ortho-substituted phenol with phosphorus trichloride gives the corresponding phosphorochloridite. The reaction of the phosphorochloridite with the desired substituted biphenol or octahydrobinaphthol in the presence of triethylamine gives the bidentate phosphite ligand. The crude bidentate phosphite ligand can be worked up by the process described in United States Patent No. 6,069,267, which is incorporated herein by reference. As disclosed therein, the bidentate phosphite ligand product mixture can typically contain the desired product in about 70% to about 90% selectivity, with other phosphite by-products such as monodentate phosphites making up the balance of the product mixture. The bidentate phosphite ligand itself or these bidentate/monodentate phosphite ligand mixtures are suitable for use with the present invention. The multidentate P-containing ligand itself or mixtures of the multidentate P-containing ligand and at least one monodentate P-containing ligand are suitable for use with the present invention. The catalyst precursor compositions employed for this process should ideally be substantially free of carbon monoxide, oxygen, and water and may be preformed or prepared in situ according to techniques well known in the art. The catalyst precursor composition may be formed by contacting the multidentate P-containing ligand with a zero-valent nickel compound having ligands easily displaced by organophosphorus ligands, such as Ni(COD)2, Ni[P(O-o-C6H4CH3)3]3, and Ni[P(O-o-C6H4CH3)3]2(C2H4), all of which are well known in the art, wherein 1,5-cyclooctadiene (COD), tris(ortho-tolyl)phosphite [P(O-o-C6H4CH3)3], and ethylene (C2H4) are the easily displaced ligands. Elemental nickel, preferably nickel powder, when combined with a halogenated catalyst, as described in United States Patent No. 3,903,120, is also a suitable source of zero-valent nickel. Alternatively, divalent nickel compounds can be combined with a reducing agent, to serve as a source of zero-valent nickel in the reaction, in the presence of the multidentate P-containing ligands. Suitable divalent nickel compounds include compounds of the formula NiZ2 where Z is halide, carboxylate, or acetylacetonate. Suitable reducing agents include metal borohydrides, metal aluminum hydrides, metal alkyls, Li, Na, K, Zn, Fe or H2. See, for example, United States Patent No. 6,893,996. In the catalyst precursor composition, the multidentate P-containing ligand may be present in excess of what can theoretically be coordinated to the nickel at a given time. The catalyst precursor composition may be dissolved in a solvent that is non-reactive toward, and miscible with, the hydrocyanation reaction mixture. Suitable solvents include, for example, aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons with 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and nitrile solvents such as acetonitrile. Alternatively, 3PN, a mixture of isomeric pentenenitriles, a mixture of isomeric methylbutenenitriles, a mixture of isomeric pentenenitriles and isomeric methylbutenenitriles, or the reaction product from a previous reaction campaign, may be used to dissolve the catalyst precursor composition. The reaction temperature is maintained within the range of 80 °C to 140 °C, for example within the range of 100 °C to 130 °C. Generally, the reaction pressure should be sufficient to maintain the reagents in the liquid state, with such pressure at least, in part, a function of the amount of unreacted BD present in the reaction mixture. Though the invention is not limited by an upper limit of pressure, for practical purposes the pressure generally ranges from 15 psia to 300 psia 103 kPa to 2068 kPa). HCN, substantially free of carbon monoxide, oxygen, ammonia, and water can be introduced to the reaction as a vapor, liquid, or mixtures thereof. As an alternative, a cyanohydrin can be used as the source of HCN. See, for example, United States Patent No. 3,655,723. The molar ratio of the HCN in the feed to the BD in the feed is in the range of 0.90:1.00 to 1.04:1.00, for example in the range of 0.92:1.00 to 0.98:1.00. Avoiding the use of a large excess of BD in relation to HCN can be advantageous in that, after reaction, the small quantity of unreacted BD may not warrant recovery and recycle to the hydrocyanation reactor. Additionally, the formation of thermally-driven BD-based yield loss products, such as BD dimers, can be reduced with lower BD amounts. The molar ratio of the zero-valent nickel in the feed to the BD in the feed is in the range of 0.00005:1.00 to 0.0050:1.00, for example in the range 0.0001:1.00 to 0.0010:1.00. The residence time in the reaction zone (for example, the time necessary for the combined feeds to displace one reactor volume in a CSTR) is typically determined by the desire to maintain the 2M3BN concentration below about 15 weight percent of the reaction mass, for example at or below about 10 weight percent of the reaction mass, and is also related to the catalyst concentration and reaction temperature. Generally residence times will be in the range of about 0.5 to about 15 hours, for example in the range of about 1 to about 10 hours. The hydrocyanation and isomerization reaction mixture may be used "as is" in subsequent reaction steps for the production of ADN. Alternatively, the reaction product and components of the catalyst precursor composition can be recovered by conventional techniques known in the art, such as, for example, by liquid-liquid extraction as disclosed in United States Patent No. 6,936,171 and by flash distillation, for example at a pressure in the range of about 10 torr to about 700 torr (about 1 kPa to about 93 kPa). The catalyst precursor composition-containing "distillation tails" may be recycled back to the reaction zone after purging a portion of the mixture to prevent build-up of "high boiling" impurities. The reaction product, the "distillation make", is a mixture comprised predominantly of 3PN, with lesser amounts of isomeric pentenenitriles, 2M3BN, 2-methyl-2-butenenitrile, BD, HCN, and vinylcyclohexene. The desired 3PN and other isomeric pentenenitriles can be recovered from the reaction product by distillation and other constituent parts such as BD, HCN, and 2M3BN either recycled to the reaction zone or disposed of. The following Examples were performed using a catalyst precursor composition wherein the multidentate P-containing ligand was a bidentate P-containing ligand, referred to as "Phosphite A" in the chemical formula for the nickel source below. The multidentate P-containing ligand of the Examples is represented by Formula II wherein R1 is isopropyl; R2, R6, and R8 are H; and R3, R4, R5, and R7 are methyl. The nickel source charged to the autoclave comprised the compound (Phosphite A)Ni(crotyl)CN dissolved in a nitrile solvent mixture. "Crotyl" represents a butenyl group having the empirical formula C4H7. The multidentate P-containing ligand, Phosphite A, of the Examples may be prepared by any suitable synthetic means known in the art. For example, 3,3'-diisopropyl-5,5',6,6'-tetramethyl-2,2'-biphenol can be prepared by the procedure disclosed in United States Published Patent Application No. 2003/0100802, which is incorporated herein by reference, in which 4-methylthymol can undergo oxidative coupling to the substituted biphenol in the presence of a copper chlorohydroxide-TMEDA complex (TMEDA is N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine) and air. The phosphorochloridite of 2,4-xylenol, (C8H9O)2PCl, can be prepared, for example, by the procedure disclosed in United States Published Patent Application No. 2004/0106815, which is incorporated herein by reference. To form this phosphorochloridite selectively, anhydrous triethylamine and 2,4-xylenol can be added separately and concurrently in a controlled manner to PCl3 dissolved in an appropriate solvent under temperature-controlled conditions. The reaction of the phosphorochloridite with the 3,3'-diisopropyl-5,5',6,6'-tetramethyl-2,2'-biphenol to form the desired multidentate P-containing ligand, Phosphite A, can be performed, for example, according to the method disclosed in United States Patent No. 6,069,267, which is hereby incorporated by reference. The phosphorochloridite can be reacted with 3,3'-diisopropyl-5,5',6,6'-tetramethyl-2,2'-biphenol in the presence of an organic base to form Phosphite A, which can be isolated according to techniques well known in the art, as also described in United States Patent No. 6,069,267. For each Example, the (Phosphite A)Ni(crotyl)CN compound was prepared as follows. In a nitrogen atmosphere, the Phosphite A, represented by Formula II wherein R1 is isopropyl; R2, R6, and R8 are H; and R3, R4, R5, and R7 are methyl, and Ni(COD)2 (COD is 1,5-cyclooctadiene) were combined in a molar ratio of 1:1 in a flask. Trans-3-pentenenitrile (95 wt%, Aldrich), which had been previously dried over molecular sieves and degassed with nitrogen, was added to the same flask (about 200 mL for 10 g of Phosphite A) and the mixture was stirred until an orange homogeneous solution formed. All volatiles were removed under vacuum at ambient temperature to yield an orange powder. The powder was triturated with anhydrous acetonitrile to remove excess pentenenitriles and other impurities, and then all volatiles were again removed under vacuum to produce (Phosphite A)Ni(crotyl)CN as an orange solid. Trans-3-pentenenitrile (95 wt%) produced from BD hydrocyanation, 2M3BN isomerization, and pentenenitrile hydrocyanation processes may be obtained commercially from the Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company. This material contains trace amounts of 2M3BN also prepared from a BD hydrocyanation and/or 2M3BN isomerization process. The purity of the BD feed was greater than 99%. Freshly prepared anhydrous, uninhibited, liquid HCN was utilized in all Examples.
