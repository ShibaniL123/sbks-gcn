115.10: [(S)-2-(5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-{2-[4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-2,6-dioxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-propyl]-tert-butyl carbamate
490 mg (2.6 mmol) of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride and 284 mg (2.6 mmol) of 1-oxy-pyridin-2-ol are added to a solution containing 971 mg (2.1 mmol) of [3-((S)-2-tert-butoxycarbonylamino-1-methylethyl)-5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl]-acetic acid in 5 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction mixture is stirred for 5 minutes and then 645 mg (2.3 mmol) of 7-methoxy-3-piperidin-4-yl-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-2-one and 0.4 ml (2.6 mmol) of triethylamine are added. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 12 hours and then diluted with ethyl acetate and water. The aqueous phase is extracted three times with ethyl acetate, the organic phase is washed with a saturated solution of sodium carbonate and then with 1N aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid. After drying over magnesium sulphate, the solution is filtered and concentrated under vacuum. After purification by silica gel chromatography eluted with a mixture of methanol in dichloromethane, following a polarity gradient (from 0% to 5% of methanol in dichloromethane), 1.2 g (79%) of [(S)-2-(5-(2-chloro-3-fluorophenyl)-3-{2-[4-(7-methoxy-2-oxo-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-benzo[d][1,3]diazepin-3-yl)-piperidin-1-yl]-2-oxo-ethyl}-2,6-dioxo-3,6-dihydro-2H-pyrimidin-1-yl)-propyl]-tert-butyl carbamate is obtained in the form of a beige solid.
