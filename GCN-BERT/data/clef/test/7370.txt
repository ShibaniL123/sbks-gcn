The fire pit burner 100 includes an inlet hub 102, a fuel supply spoke 104, and a burner tube 106. The combination of the a fuel supply spoke 104 and the burner tube 106 may also be referred to as a burner leg 134. All components of fire pit burner 100 may be made out of stainless steel, or any other material known in the art used in the making of burner tubes. The inlet hub 102 is adapted to be fluidly connected to a fuel source (not shown). For example, the inlet hub 102 may include an internally threaded opening 132 for connection to a fuel source. The fluid connection between the inlet hub 102 and the fuel source may also be achieved through any other means known in the art. The fuel supply spoke 104 has a first end 108 and a second end 110. The burner tube 106 has a first end 118 and a second end 120, and may include a curved portion 112, a first straight portion 114, and a second straight portion 116. The first end 108 of the fuel supply spoke 104 is fluidly connected to the inlet hub 102 at an angle such that the elevation of the first end 108 is above the elevation of the second end 110 (as shown in FIG. 1b). The second end 110 of the fuel supply spoke 104 is fluidly connected to the burner tube 106. According to the embodiment shown in FIG. 1a, the second end 110 of the fuel supply spoke 104 is fluidly connected to the curved portion 112 of the burner tube 106. Connections between the inlet hub 102, the fuel supply spoke 104, and the burner tube 106 may be achieved by welding or any other means known in the art. The first end 118 and the second end 120 of the burner tube 106 are mechanically sealed by welding or any other means known in the art. In another embodiment, first end 118 and the second end 120 of the burner tube 106 are fluidly connected to adjacent ends of adjacent burner tubes 106. As depicted in FIG. 1b, the elevation of the first end 118 and the second end 120 of the burner tube 106 may be above the elevation of the curved portion 112 and the second end 110 of the fuel supply spoke 104. Additionally, the angles of the fuel supply spoke 104 and the burner tube 106 may be substantially parallel and sloping away from the inlet hub 102 to aid in draining water or moisture away from the inlet hub 102. In one embodiment the slope of the fuel supply spoke 104 is gradual so as to maintain a low profile of no more than about 1.5 inches between the top of the inlet hub 102 and the bottom of the burner tube 106 at its outermost perimeter. In one preferred embodiment, the portions of the burner tube 106, including the first end 118 and the second end 120, are located approximately five inches from, but no more than about five inches from, fuel supply spoke 104. The tubing is designed and positioned so as to minimize void areas. Maximum void areas vary from three to five inches depending on the size and the intended BTU of the fire pit burner 100. This provides a uniformly distributed, natural-looking flame pattern. The portions of the fire pit burner 100 that emit flame, including the burner tube 106 and the fuel supply spoke 104, are kept close enough together so that the emitted flames do not appear merely as an unnatural looking outline and yet far enough apart so that the emitted flames do not merge together into a single flame (i.e., like a candlestick). Additionally, burner holes are arranged in a manner that work with the fuel supply spoke 104 and the burner tube 106 to emit a natural looking uniform flame where each individual burner hole is not noticed. The fuel supply spoke 104 may include a plurality of top side spoke holes 122 located on its top surface. Fuel supply spoke 104 may also include a plurality of side spoke holes 124 located on both its left and right lateral surfaces. In one embodiment, the side spoke holes 124 are located at any angle between sixty (60) and one hundred twenty (120) degrees relative to the top side spoke holes 122. Preferably, the side spoke holes 124 and top side spoke holes 122 are separated by about ninety (90) degrees such that burner holes are located at the 9, 12, or 3 o'clock positions of the supply spoke 104 along its length. The burner tube 106 may include a plurality of top side burner holes 126 located on its top surface. Burner tube 106 may also include a plurality of side burner holes 128 located on both its left and right (or inner and outer) lateral surfaces. In one embodiment, the side burner holes 128 are located at any angle between sixty (60) and one hundred twenty (120) degrees relative to the top side burner holes 126. Preferably, the side burner holes 128 and top side burner holes 126 are separated by about ninety (90) degrees such that burner holes are located at the 9, 12, or 3 o'clock positions of the burner tube 106 along its length. According to another embodiment, the first straight portion 114 and the second straight portion 116 of the burner tube 106 each include a plurality of top side burner holes 126 located on their top surfaces and a plurality of side burner holes 128 located on both their left and right (or inner and outer) lateral surfaces. In one embodiment, the side burner holes 128 are located at any angle between sixty (60) and one hundred twenty (120) degrees relative to the top side burner holes 126. Preferably, the side burner holes 128 and top side burner holes 126 are separated by about ninety (90) degrees. The curved portion 112 of burner tube 106, according to still another embodiment, may include a plurality of radial holes 130 located on its inside radius. Preferably, the top and side burner holes on both the burner tube 106 and supply spoke 104 are spaced out along the length of tubes and are arranged in a substantially alternating pattern along the top and lateral sides so as to produce a uniformly distributed, aesthetically pleasing flame. In one embodiment the holes are no more than two inches apart and are positioned, alternately, at the 3, 12 and 9 o'clock positions along burner 100. As shown and described herein, the shape and the direction of fuel flow through the fire pit burner 100 (i.e., from the hub, through a spoke to a perimeter, and back towards the hub) forces the fuel and flame to spread out more uniformly than other burner designs. In one embodiment, to promote a more uniform fuel and flame distribution pattern, the curved portion 112, the first straight portion 114, the second straight portion 116, the first end 118, and the second end 120 of the burner tube 106 are all located no more than five inches from the fuel supply spoke 104. The uniform fuel and flame distribution achieved by this design results in less media, such as artificial logs, lava, or other media known in the art for use with gas burners, being required to conceal the shape of the fire pit burner 100. Referring to FIGS. 2a and 2b, a second embodiment of a fire pit burner 200 is shown. In this embodiment, fire pit burner 200 includes an inlet hub 102, a fuel supply spoke 104, and a burner tube 106. The inlet hub 102, fuel supply spoke 104, and burner tube 106 are the same and connected in the same manner as described above with the following exceptions. The burner tube 106 further includes a second curved portion 202, a third curved portion 204, a third straight portion 206, and a fourth straight portion 208. The top side burner holes 126 and the side burner holes 128 described above are extended and located on the second curved portion 202, a third curved portion 204, a third straight portion 206, and a fourth straight portion 208. In a preferred version of this embodiment, to promote a more uniform fuel and flame distribution pattern, the curved portion 112, the second curved portion 202, the third curved portion 204, the first straight portion 114, the second straight portion 116, the third straight portion 206, the fourth straight portion 208, the first end 118, and the second end 120 of the burner tube 106 are all located approximately, and no more than, five inches from the fuel supply spoke 104. Consistent with the described invention, any number of burner legs 134 may be connected to the inlet hub 102. The number of burner legs 134 is determined by the desired flame pattern and the user's needs. Referring to FIG. 3, an exemplary five leg fire pit burner configuration 300 is shown. When multiple burners are distributed about the inlet hub 102 each burner may be connected in the following manner. The second end 120 of the burner tube 106 of a burner is mechanically, not fluidly, connected to the first end 118 of the burner tube 106 of the adjacent burner to its right. The connection may be achieved by welding the ends together, or any other means known in the art for joining metal. In an embodiment, fuel does not pass from one adjacent burner to the next through the mechanically connected first and second ends, which remain sealed. In another embodiment, adjacent burner legs 134 are fluidly connected.
