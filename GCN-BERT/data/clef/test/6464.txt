(2-methoxyquinolin-3-yl)methanol
2-Methoxyquinoline-3-carbaldehyde (1.45 g, 7.75 mmol) was suspended in methanol (20 mL) and the mixture was cooled to 0° C. in an ice bath. Sodium borohydride (600 mg, 15.86 mmol) was added, causing bubbling. The reaction mixture was stirred and was allowed to warm to room temperature overnight (ice bath was allowed to melt). The reaction mixture was concentrated, and the crude material was taken up in saturated aqueous bicarbonate solution (50 mL) and was extracted with dichloromethane (2×50 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to afford the product (1.46 g, 7.72 mmol, 100% yield).
