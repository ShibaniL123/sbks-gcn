CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/988,346 filed May 5, 2014, herein incorporated by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to new heterocyclic compounds that demonstrate activity as cell signaling and/or epigenetic modulators including inhibitors of kinases or bromodomain proteins or both, and methods of using the compounds in therapeutic applications including but not limned to as anti-tumor agents in mammals. BACKGROUND Cell signaling is widely recognized as a key component in normal cell proliferation and cell death, and in neoplastic transformation. A number of distinct biochemical pathways have been identified within this genre. One of these, the PI-3 kinase (PI-3K or PI3K) pathway (also known as the PI-3 Kinase/AKT pathway) is involved in the production of the second messenger molecule PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3). Molecular and genetic studies have shown a strong correlation between the PI-3 kinase pathway and a variety of diseases in humans such as inflammation, autoimmune conditions, and cancers. (See P. Workman et al., Nat. Biotechnol. 2006, 24, 794-796; I. Vivanco et al., Nat. Rev. Cancer 2002, 2, 489-501). The PI-3 kinase pathway controls a number of cellular functions including cell growth, metabolism, differentiation, and apoptosis. Many types of cancer are thought to arise in response to abnormalities in signal transduction pathways such as the PI-3 kinase pathway. The PI-3 kinase pathway comprises a number of enzymes including PI-3 kinase, PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin homolog deleted on chromosome Ten), and AKT (a serine/threonine kinase also known as PKB) all of which are involved in producing and maintaining intracellular levels of the second messenger molecule PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PIP3). Homeostasis of this important second messenger is maintained by PI-3 kinase and PTEN. When either PI-3 kinase or PTEN are mutated and/or reduced in activity, PIP3 levels are perturbed and this perturbation may act as a trigger in the development of cancer. Indeed, both PI-3 kinase and PTEN have been found to be mutated in multiple cancers including glioblastoma, ovarian, breast, endometrial, hepatic, melanoma, gut, lung, renal cell, thyroid and lymphoid cancer. The Class IA isoform of the regulatory subunit of PI-3 kinase, p110α, is frequently over-expressed and mutated in many cancers including gliomas, colon, brain, breast, lung, prostate, gynecological and other tumor types (Ibid.; Y. Samuels et al., Science, 304, 554 (2004)). Thus, a rational approach in treating cancer relates to developing drugs that act on signaling pathways including the kinases of the PI-3 kinase pathway. The PI-3 kinase family comprises roughly 16 members divided into 3 classes based on sequence homology and the particular product formed by enzyme catalysis. Class I PI-3 kinases have 2 subunits: a 110 kd catalytic subunit and an 85 kd regulatory subunit. Class I PI-3 kinases are involved in important signal transduction events downstream of cytokines, integrins, growth factors and immunoreceptors. Inhibition of class I PI-3 kinase induces apoptosis, blocks tumor-induced angiogenesis in vivo, and increases radiosensitivity in certain tumors. Other mechanisms for cancer involving loss of a negative regulator have also been identified. For example, PTEN, a lipid phosphatase, regulates signaling through the PI-3 kinase pathway by dephosphorylating PIP3, the product of PI-3 kinase (for review see L. C. Cantley et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1999, 96, 4240-4245). Tumors having mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene have been identified in a number of different cancers. As a consequence of PTEN loss and the resultant increase in PIP3 levels, signal propagation through downstream kinases such as AKT is constitutively elevated. Preclinical studies suggest that this constitutive kinase activation creates a kinase dependency analogous to that in tumors with activating mutations in the kinase itself. Genetic and biochemical evidence has shown that constitutive activation of AKT can regulate TOR (mTOR in mammalian systems) through phosphorylation of the tuberous sclerosis complex (K. Inoki et al., Nat. Cell Biol. 2002, 4, 648-657). Hence, tumors with loss-of-function mutations in PTEN exhibit constitutive activation of AKT, as well as other downstream kinases such as mTOR, and many tumors in murine models are sensitive to mTOR inhibitors (M. S. Neshat et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2001, 98, 10314-10319). Therapeutic agents that target key signaling pathways are of considerate interest. LY294002 (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one) is a first-generation potent, non-selective inhibitor of PI-3 kinases with an IC50 of 1.4 μM (C. J. Vlahos et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1994, 269, 5241-5248). While LY294002 is an effective inhibitor of PI-3 kinase, and has found utility as a pharmacological tool, it has several undesirable attributes that render it unsuitable for clinical use, including lack of aqueous solubility, poor pharmacokinetics, unacceptable toxicity, lack of tissue specificity, rapid metabolism in animals, and a synthetic route that uses carbon disulfide, a highly toxic compound. As such, LY294002 has never been developed for clinical use but has stimulated the search for improved PI-3 inhibitors of which over 10 are in clinical development and one has received FDA approval. Tumorigenesis, as well as other disease conditions, may also result from epigenetic-induced changes in gene expression and cellular phenotype in the absence of nucleic acid mutations. Epigenetic effects have been attributed to acetylation of lysine residues on proteins. Three types of proteins appear to be important in this process: the “writers” (i.e., DNA methyltransferase which adds methyl groups to DNA), the “erasers” (i.e., histone deacetylase, HDAC, which removes acetyl groups from histones), and the “readers” (i.e., BET bromodomain proteins, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT in humans). A number of bromodomain proteins have been identified and correlated with various diseases. See e.g. Muller et al., Expert Reviews in Molec. Med. 13, 1-21, 2011 herein incorporated by reference. The bromodomain proteins serve as “readers” for chromatin to recruit regulatory enzymes such as the writers and erasers of histone modification which can then lead to regulation of gene expression. Inhibitors of BET proteins are potentially useful in the treatment of a number of conditions including but not limited to obesity, inflammation, and cancer (A. C. Belkina et al., Nat. Rev. Cancer 2012, 12, 465-477). BET inhibitors act as acetylated lysine mimetics which disrupt the binding interaction of BET proteins with acetylated lysine residues on histones (D. S. Hewings et al., J. Med. Chem. 2012, 55, 9393-9413). This disruption leads to suppression of transcription of genes involved in cancer including c-MYC, MYCN, BCL-2, and some NF-kB-dependent genes (J. E. Delmore et al., Cell 2011, 146,904-917; A. Puissant, Cancer Discov. 2013, 3, 308-323). For example, B-cell malignancies are associated with the activation of the c-MYC gene which is partially controlled by the PI-3 kinase-AKT-GSK3beta signaling axis (J. E. Delmore et al., Cell 2011, 146, 904-917). MYC (encompassing c-MYC and MYCN) is an oncoprotein that has been difficult to inhibit using small molecule approaches (E. V. Prochownik et al.. Genes Cancer 2010, 1, 650-659). Recently it has been shown that BET inhibition prevents the transcription of MYCN (A. Puissant, Cancer Discov. 2013, 3, 308-323), and blocking PI-3K enhances MYC degradation (L. Chester et al.. Cancer Res. 2006, 66, 8139-8146). Therefore, a single molecule that inhibits both PI-3K and bromodomain proteins would provide a novel and potentially more effective way to inhibit MYC activity. Several recent reviews cover the inception and status of the bromodomain inhibitor field including D. Gallenkamp et al., Chem. Med. Chem., 2014, 9, 438-464 and S. Muller et al., Med. Chem. Commun. 2014, 5, 288-296. Most recently it has been reported that inhibition of BET bromodomain proteins such as BRD4 can prevent the kinome adaptation response (i.e., induced transcriptional upregulation of multiple kinases involved in resistance mechanisms) found for tyrosine kinase inhibitor drugs, such as lapatinib (T. J. Stuhlmiller et al., Cell Reports 2015, 11, 390-404). The need for more efficacious treatments for cancer and other conditions has lead to combination therapies using multiple anticancer agents, or alternatively multitargeting agents in which a single drug blocks more than one target (See D. Melisi et al., Curr. Opin. Pharm., 2013, 13, 536-542). It is known that some kinase inhibitors also inhibit bromodomain proteins. For example, LY294002 has been shown to inhibit BET bromodomains (A. Dittmann et al., ACS Chem. Biol., 2014, 9, 495-502) with an IC50 of 12.43 μM on the BRD4 bromodomain protein (binding region 1). Replacing the morpholine group of LV294002 with a piperizine group (LY303511) causes LY294002 to lose all PI3K inhibition activity and, likewise, replacement with a thiomorpholine group causes LY294002 to lose most PI3K inhibition activity (C. Vlahos et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1994, 269, 5241-5248). However, the piperizine replacement compound (LY303511) has been shown to maintain BRD4 inhibition as it exhibits an IC50 of 9.05 μM on the BRD4 bromodomain protein binding region 1 (A. Dittmann et al., ASC Chem. Biol. 2014, 9, 495-502). Other kinase inhibitors have also been found to inhibit BET bromodomains. For example, the PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 and the JAK2 inhibitor TG101209 potently inhibit BET protein BRD4-1 (S W J Ember, ACS Chem Biol. 2014, 9, 1160-1171). There remains a need for potent inhibitors of PI3K and for potent inhibitors of bromodomain proteins: especially there remains a need for small molecules that inhibit both PI3K and bromodomain proteins such as BRD4. The novel heterocycles of the present invention meet this need by providing compounds with enhanced therapeutic properties useful for inhibiting tumor growth, cancer treatment and other diseases related to aberrant PI3K and/or bromodomain proteins.

Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, fluorine and chlorine. Compounds of the present disclosure, conjugates thereof, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of said compounds or of said conjugates which contain the aforementioned isotopes and/or other isotopes of other atoms are within the scope of this disclosure. Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of the present disclosure, for example those into which radioactive isotopes such as 3H and 14C are incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution assays for example when imaging tumors. Fluorine-18 (18F) is particularly preferred for ease of preparation and detectability. Isotopically labeled compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by carrying out the procedures disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples and Preparations below, by substituting a readily available isotopically labeled reagent for a non-isotopically labeled reagent. It will be appreciated that certain compounds of Formulas I-VII (or salts, procompounds/prodrugs, or conjugates, etc.) may exist in, and be isolated in, isomeric forms, including tautomeric forms, cis- or trans-isomers, as well as optically active, racemic, or diastereomeric forms. It is to be understood that the present invention encompasses a compound of Formulas I-VII in any of the tautomeric forms or as a mixture thereof, or as a mixture of diastereomers, as well as in the form of an individual diastereomer, and that the present invention encompasses a compound of Formulas I-VII as a mixture of enantiomers, as well as in the form of an individual enantiomer, any of which mixtures or form possesses inhibitory properties against kinases including PI-3 kinase, it being well known in the art how to prepare or isolate particular forms and how to determine inhibitory properties against kinases by standard tests including those described herein below. In addition, a compound of Formulas I-VII (or salt, procompound/prodrug, or conjugate thereof, etc.) may exhibit polymorphism or may form a solvate with water or an organic solvent. The present invention also encompasses any such polymorphic form, any solvate or any mixture thereof. D.1 Synthesis of Compounds of the Invention The compounds of the present invention may be prepared by processes known in the chemical art. Starting materials and intermediates used to prepare a compound of the invention are either commercially available or can be prepared by one of ordinary skill in the art. The compounds of the invention, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, may have asymmetric carbon atoms or quaternized nitrogen atoms in their structure. It will be appreciated that certain compounds of Formulas I-VII (or salts, conjugates, etc) may exist in, and be isolated in, isomeric forms, including tautomeric forms, cis- or trans-isomers, as well as optically active, racemic, or diastereomeric forms. It is to be understood that the present invention encompasses a compound of Formulas I-VII in any of the tautomeric forms or as a mixture thereof, or as a mixture of diastereomers, as well as in the form of an individual diastereomer, and that the present invention encompasses a compound of Formulas I-VII as a mixture of enantiomers, as well as in the form of an individual enantiomer, any of which mixtures or form possesses inhibitory properties against kinases, for example PI-3 kinases and/or bromodomain proteins. The compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may exist as single stereoisomers, racemates, and as mixtures of enantiomers and diastereomers. The compounds may also exist as geometric isomers. All such single stereoisomers, racemates and mixtures thereof, and geometric isomers are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Methods for the preparation and/or separation and isolation of single stereoisomers from racemic mixtures or non-racemic mixtures of stereoisomers are well known in the art. For example, optically active (R)- and (S)-isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using other conventional techniques. For example, enantiomers (R- and S-isomers) may be resolved by formation of diastereoisomeric salts or complexes which may be separated, for example, by crystallization; via formation of diastereoisomeric derivatives which may be separated, for example, by crystallization; selective reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer-specific reagent, for example enzymatic oxidation or reduction, followed by separation of the modified and unmodified enantiomers; or gas-liquid or liquid chromatography in a chiral environment, for example on a chiral support, such as silica with a bound chiral ligand or in the presence of a chiral solvent. It will be appreciated that where a desired enantiomer is converted into another chemical entity by one of the separation procedures described above, a further step may be required to liberate the desired enantiomeric form. Alternatively, a specific enantiomer may be synthesized by asymmetric synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents or by converting an enantiomer to the other by asymmetric transformation. For a mixture of enantiomers, enriched in a particular enantiomer, the major component enantiomer may be further enriched (with concomitant loss in yield) by recrystallization.

F. Therapeutic Use Compounds and compositions described herein are generally useful for the inhibition of activity of PI3K and/or one or more proteins involved in epigenetic regulation mediated by bromodomain proteins. In one embodiment the invention provides a method of modulating the PI3K pathway by inhibiting PI3K. In another embodiment the invention provides a method to modulate epigenetic regulation in a cell mediated by bromodomains (e.g., BET proteins, such as BRD1, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT, and non-BET proteins, such as CBP, ATAD2A, GCN5L, BAZ2B, FALZ, TAF1, and/or BRPF1), by administering a compound as described herein. In some embodiments, the compounds described herein are capable of inhibiting the activity of a bromodomain-containing protein, such as a BET protein (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and/or BRDT), non-BET proteins (such as CBP, ATAD2A, GCN5L, BAZ2B, FALZ, TAF1, and/or BRPF1) or a mutant thereof, in a biological sample useful for purposes including, but are not limited to, blood transfusion, organ-transplantation, biological specimen storage, and biological assays. In some embodiments the present invention provides a method of inhibiting the activity of a bromodomain-containing protein, such as a BET protein (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and/or BRDT), non-BET proteins (such as CBP, ATAD2A, GCN5L, BAZ2B, FALZ, TAF1, and/or BRPF1) or a mutant thereof, in a patient comprising the step of administering to said patient a compound or composition of the invention. The present invention further relates to methods of treating diseases and conditions associated with aberrant kinase and/or bromodomain activity by administering a therapeutically effective amount of one or more compounds of Formulas I-VII. The compounds of the invention act as inhibitors of kinase activity and/or bromodomain proteins thereby providing a therapeutic method for treating conditions relating to such defects. Inhibitory activity can be determined routinely using known methods. For example, in vitro kinase inhibition (e.g., PI3K inhibition) can be detected by a standard kinase inhibition assay using labeled ATP to determine if a test compound inhibits the transfer of phosphate from ATP to the kinase substrate. In vivo, PI3K inhibition can be determined from target tissue biopsies by standard tissue processing to disrupt cells and then performing Western Blot analysis to determine the presence or absence of pAKT (substrate of PI3K) relative to a control sample. The activity of a compound of the invention as an inhibitor of a bromodomain-containing protein, such as a BET protein, such as BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and/or BRDT, or an isoform or mutant thereof; may be determined in vitro, in vivo, or in a cell line. In vitro assays include assays that determine inhibition of bromodomain-containing proteins. Alternatively, inhibitor binding may be determined by running a competition experiment where a provided compound is incubated with a bromodomain-containing protein, such as a BET protein bound to known ligands, labeled or unlabeled. For example, bromodomain inhibition can be determined in vitro using Alpha Screen Technology (http://www.reactionbiology.com/webapps/site/NewsPDFs/Bromodomain%20Assay%20Platform%20for%20Drug%20Screening%20and%20Discovery.pdf). In vivo bromodomain inhibition can be determined indirectly by evaluating the amount of protein present of proteins whose genes' transcription is influenced or controlled by the bromodomain protein, for example, the MYCN protein transcription is controlled by BRD4 (J. E. Delmore et al., Cell, 2011, 146, 904-917; A. Puissant, Cancer Discov. 2013, 3, 308-323). Bromodomain inhibition may also be predicted by in silico modeling as described below in the Examples. In certain embodiments, the invention provides a method of treating a disorder (as described above) in a subject, comprising administering to the subject identified as in need thereof, a compound of the invention. The identification of those patients who are in need of treatment for the disorders described herein is within the ability and knowledge of one skilled in the art. Certain of the methods for identification of patients who are at risk of developing the above disorders which can be treated by the subject method are appreciated in the medical arts, such as family history, and the presence of risk factors associated with the development of that disease state in the subject patient. Assessing the efficacy of a treatment in a patient includes determining the pre-treatment extent of a disorder by methods known in the art (e.g., determining tumor size or screening for tumor markers where the cell proliferative disorder is cancer), then administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention, to the patient. After an appropriate period of time after administration (e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, one month, six months), the extent of the disorder is again determined. Modulation (e.g., decrease) of the extent or invasiveness of the disorder (e.g. reduced tumor size) would indicate efficacy of the treatment. The extent or invasiveness of the disorder may be determined periodically throughout treatment. For example, the extent or invasiveness of the disorder may be assessed every few hours, days or weeks to assess the further efficacy of the treatment. A decrease in extent or invasiveness of the disorder indicates that the treatment is efficacious. The methods described may be used to screen or select patients that may benefit from treatment with a compound of the invention. The present invention encompasses medical use of compounds of Formula I-VII including methods of treatment of a patient suffering from a condition or disease associated with aberrant kinase activity, including PI-3 kinase, or with MYC (c-MYC or MYCN) driven disease, or any disease abated by the use of a bromodomain inhibitor. For example, kinase activity may be aberrant by being excessive, or constitutively active in a patient in need of such treatment. Exemplary, but non-exclusive diseases and adverse conditions relating to aberrant kinase activity, in particular PI-3 kinase signaling activity, have been disclosed in the art, for example U.S. 2002/0150954A1; U.S. Pat.

Mühlradt et al., Cancer Res. 1997, 57, 3344-3346; K. C. Nicolaou et al., Nature 1997, 387, 268-272; R. J. Vasquez et al., Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997, 8, 973-985; and D. Panda et al., J. Biol. Chem. 1996, 271, 29807-29812. Other suitable cytotoxic agents include, but are not limited to, epidophyllotoxin; an antineoplastic enzyme; a topoisomerase inhibitor; procarbazine; mitoxantrone; platinum coordination complexes such as cis-platin and carboplatin, biological response modifiers; growth inhibitors; antihormonal therapeutic agents, leucovorin; tegafur; and haematopoietic growth factors.

Inhibitors of the transduction of cellular proliferative signals are cytostatic agents. Representative examples include, but are not limited to, epidermal growth factor inhibitors, Her-2 inhibitors, MEK-1 kinase inhibitory MAPK kinase inhibitors, PI3 inhibitors, Src kinase inhibitors, and PDGF inhibitors. The present methods of the invention also encompass treating pancreatitis comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or compounds of Formula I-VII. As discussed in I. Gukovsky et al., Gastroenterology 2004, 126, 554-566, key pathologic responses are regulated by PI-3 kinase and may play an important role in pancreatitis. The present methods also encompass treating ulcers comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I-VII. The present invention also encompasses a method for treating gastric cancer, such as stomach cancer, comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention. As discussed in Bacon et al., Digestive Disease Week Abstract and Itinerary Planner, Vol. 2003, Abstract No. M921 (2003) and Rokutan et al., Digestive Disease Week Abstracts and Itinerary Planner, Vol. 2003, Abstract No. 354 (2003), PI-3 kinase is involved in the adhesion of Helicobacterpylori to gastric cells. The present invention also encompasses a method for treating age-related macular degeneration (AMD) comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I-VII. As discussed in M. R. Barakat et al., Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs 2009, 18, 637-646, inhibition of VEGF inhibits blood vessel overgrowth associated with AMD. The methods of the invention may also treat AMD by inhibiting angiogenesis. The methods of the present invention also encompass treating conditions associated with a mutant PTEN comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I-VII. PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 10q23, in which mutations have been identified in patients with Cowden disease. As discussed in A. Vega et al., J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003, 121, 1356-1359, mutations in PTEN can reduce the ability to inhibit the activation of the proto-oncogene AKT. Inhibitors of PI-3 kinase may inhibit phosphorylation of AKT, thereby reducing the deleterious effect of a mutant PTEN. Tat is the human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) trans-activator protein known to be tightly regulated by lysine acetylatlon (Kiernan et al., EMBO Journal 1999, 18, 6106-6118). It is also known that HIV-1 Tat transcriptional activity is absolutely required for productive HIV viral replication (Jeang, et al., Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1994, 188, 123-144). Thus, the interaction of the acetyl-lysine of the Tat protein with one or more bromodomain-containing proteins (which are associated with chromatin remodeling) could mediate gene transcription allowing viral replication. Blocking bromodomain-containing proteins can thus serve to inhibit HIV viral replication and act as a therapeutic treatment for diseases involving HIV viral replication such as AIDS. The present invention encompasses a method for treating diseases involving HIV viral replication such as, but not limited to, AIDS comprising administering to a patient in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I-VII. The methods of the invention comprise administering one or more compounds of Formula I-VII for treating viral infections such as but not limited to human papillomavirus, Herpesvirus, Epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. FIG. 1 shows the structures of several reported BET inhibitors some of which contain the 3,5-dimethylisoxazole chemotype as the acetyl-lysine mimetic moiety (D. S. Hewings, J. Med. Chem. 2011, 54, 6761-6770; D. S. Hewings et al., J. Med. Chem. 2012, 55, 9393-9413; D. S. Hewings et al., J. Med. Chem. 2013, 56, 3217-3227). The earliest inhibitor discovered was JQ1(+) followed by related structures leading to less complex 4-substituted-3,5-dimethylisoxazoles (SDMIs) providing a genotype known in the art to participate in Inhibiting BET. In another aspect, the invention provides a method for inhibiting the activity of a bromodomain-containing protein in a patient in need of such treatment comprising administering to said patient one or more compounds of Formula I-VII either alone or in combination with other treatment agents. In another aspect, the invention provides a method for treating epigenetically-based conditions relating to bromodomain protein activity in a patient in need thereof, comprising administering to said patient a bromodomain-inhibiting compound in Formula I-VII Cellular injury or inflammation triggers a dominant activation of promoter/enhancer elements within the epigenome and drives a pathophysiologic program. Examples of such bromodomain-related disorders include cancer or other proliferative disorder, sepsis, autoimmune diseases, neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease and Huntington's Disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, viral infection, fibrotic diseases, inflammatory diseases, and elements of organ failure syndromes including but not restricted to heart failure following myocardial injury or infarction. Additionally, response to cellular injury in organ failure to include renal pulmonary, cardiac and brain injury which activates a dominant epigenetic program which propagate the pathophysiologic state and disease are treated using the compounds of Formula I-VII. Bromodomain inhibitors such as compounds of Formula I-Vii interfere with and block aberrant transcriptional programs which cause such diseases and hence BET bromodomain inhibitors described in this application may be administered in the treatment of such diseases in humans and other mammals. The methods of the invention further relate to treating a subject with a MYC-dependent cancer, comprising administration of a compound of Formula I-VII. Subjects with MYC-dependent cancer can be identified and monitored during treatment in any number of ways, for example, by determining MYC mRNA expression levels or MYC protein expression in the tumor. Also, preferred subjects for treatment with the methods of the invention can be identified by historical experience, family history, genetic testing for chromosomal aberrations such as translocations, or known prevalence of MYC activation in certain cancers such as multiple myeloma (J. E. Delmore, Cell, 2011, 146, 904-917), CLL (J. R. Brown et al., Clin. Cancer Res., 2012, 18, 3791-3802), leukaemia (M. A. Dawson, Nature, 2013, 478, 529-533), neuroblastoma (A. Puissant, Cancer Discov. 2013, 3, 308-323), medulloblastoma (Y. J. Cho, J. Clin. Oncol. 2010, 29, 1424-1430). Diseases and conditions treatable according to the methods of this invention comprise administering one or more compounds of Formula I-VII including, but are not limited to, cancer and other proliferative disorders, sepsis, autoimmune disease, and viral infection. Diseases such as atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes (V. A. DeWaskin et al., Nature Rev. Drug Disc. 2013, 12, 661-662) and obesity and inflammation (A. C. Belkina et al., Nature Rev. Cancer, 2012, 12, 465-474) are also treatable according to the methods of the invention. The invention further provides methods for treating or ameliorating cancer or another proliferative disorder by administration of an effective amount of a compound of Formula I-VII to a mammalin including a human in need of such treatment.

G. Administrating and Dosage A compound or composition of the present invention may be administered in any manner including but not limited to orally, parenterally, sublingually, transdermally, rectally, transmucosally, topically, pulmonarily, nasally, or bucally. Parenteral administration includes but is not limited to intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal, and intraarticular. A compound(s) or composition of the invention may also be administered via slow controlled i.v. infusion or by release from an implant device. A therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention required for use in therapy varies with the nature of the condition being treated, the length of treatment time desired, the age and the condition of the patient, and is ultimately determined by the attending physician. In general, however, doses employed for adult human treatment typically are in the range of 0.001 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg per day. The dose may be about 1 μg/kg to about 100 μg/kg per day. The desired dose may be conveniently administered in a single dose, or as multiple doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more sub-doses per day. Multiple doses often are desired, or required. A number of factors may lead to the compounds of the present invention being administered over a wide range of dosages. When given in combination with other therapeutic agents, the dosage of the compounds of the present invention may be given at relatively lower dosages. In addition, the use of targeting agents on a conjugate of the invention is expected to lower the effective dosage required for treatment. As a result, the daily dosage of a compound of the present invention may be from about 1 ng/kg to about 100 mg/kg.

As described by the non-limiting list of amines and cyanoamines in section D.1. above it will be appreciated that the above representative synthesis of compounds using morpholine or cyano-morpholine can be utilized in identical fashion with a variety of amines and cyanoamines. Additionally, the compounds of Formula I-VII containing the chromone carbonyl (M=O) may be converted to the thione analog (M=O) by exposure to Lawasson's reagent using conditions described by G. Morales, J. Med. Chem. 2013, 56, 1922-1939 and Example 3. Representative compounds of the invention are depicted in Tables 1-4 and 6-10 as merely illustrative and not limiting of the scope of the invention in any way. EXAMPLE 1 Biological Testing of Compounds Representative compounds of the invention were tested for inhibitory activity, which is summarized in Table 5. Data provide the inhibitory concentration needed to inhibit 50% of the enzymatic activity (IC50) for PI3K (alpha, beta, delta, and gamma isoforms), mTOR, PLK-1, PIM-1 and DNA-PK and the percent enzyme inhibition at certain concentrations of tested compound (columns 2-24). The assays determined the amount of radioactive phosphate transferred from P-33 labelled ATP to the substrate by the enzyme in the presence of various concentrations of the inhibitor test compounds. The concentration needed to inhibit 50% of the pAKT signal (column 25 of Table 5) was determined as follows: PC3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va., Cat.# CRL-1435). Two million cells from the prostate cancer line PC3 were placed into 6 cm culture dishes and allowed to grow in complete RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., Cat.# 22400-105) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., Cat.# 10438-026). After this time period the cells were serum starved for 5 hours followed by application of the test compound. Test compound was added as a DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) solution such that the final DMSO concentration in the cell media was less than or equal to 0.2% by volume. After 30 minutes of exposure the growth factor stimulant, human IGF-1 (Pepro Tech, Inc., Rocky Hill, N.J., Cat.#100-11), was added in each well. After 30 minutes of IGF-1 exposure, cells were removed from the media and cell lysates were prepared using RIPA Lysis buffer (Upstate, Lake Placid, N.Y., Cat.#20-188), keeping on ice. The pAKT serine 473 level was measured in duplicate samples of the cell lysates using commercially available assays such as the Pathscan® Sandwich ELIAS kit for Ser473 pAKT (Cell Signaling, Danvers, Mass., Cat.#7160). A SpectraMax Plus spectrophotometric plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnydale, Calif.) was used to measure the optical density signal for pAKT at 450 nm (OD450 nm). The pAKT OD450 nm readings were normalized by total protein amount in the cell lysates determined by standard methods. Concentrations of test compounds required to inhibit IGF stimulated pAKT levels to 50% of maximum levels in PC3 cells (termed DM50 for decreased maximum 50%) were calculated by inputting the dose responses in the software package GraphPad Prism4 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.). The PC3 cell proliferation data in column 26 of Table 5 was obtained as follows: PC3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, Va., Cat.# CRL-1435). Two thousand cells from the prostate cancer line PC3 were placed in 50 μL of complete RPMI 1640 media (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., Cat.# 22400-105) with 10% fetal bovine serum, (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif., Cat.#10438-026) into each well of 96-well cell culture plates in a hexaplicate sampling pattern. A 50 μL aliquot of test compound (prepared from stock test compounds in DMSO diluted into media) was added to the appropriate well such that the final concentrations of test compound were 200, 40, 8, 1.6, 0.32, 0.064, 0.0128, 0.00256, and 0 μM and the final DMSO concentration was less than or equal to 0.2% . The plates were incubated for 72 hours 37° C. in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. At the end of this time a 10 μL aliquot of WST solution (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) was added into each of the wells. Cells were exposed to the WST solution for 4 hours. A SpectraMax Plus spectrophotometric plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnydale, Calif.) was then used to measure the optical density at 459 nm (OD450 nm). Sigmoidal curves were drawn for the dose responses and IC50 values were calculated using the software package GraphPad Prism4 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, Calif.). EXAMPLE 2 BRD4 Molecular Modeling Testing of Compounds BRD4 Binding Value Column in Tables 1-10; Modeling Results Demonstrating Compounds of Formula II-VII Bind the Acetyl-Lysine Region Computational modeling was performed using the readily available AotoDock (http://autodock.scripps.edu/ and http://vina.scripps.edu/) suite of software tools. AutoDock Vina was used to dock in silico the compounds of the invention (Formulas I-VII) at the site where the LY294002 compound has been described to reside in BRD4-BD1 (bromodomain 1 of BRD4) which has been described in the crystal structure (A. Dittmann et al., 2014, 9(2), 495-502). As proof of concept, we docked LY294002 at the same BRD4-BD1 binding site found in the crystal structure of LY294002/BRD4(BR1) and confirmed that the docked LY294002 conformation overlays almost perfectly with the co-crystallized LY294002. The docking results of the compounds of the invention with the empty crystal structure of BRD4 (co-crystallized LY294002 removed) are shown (along with structures of the compounds of the invention) with the docking score (binding energy) given as delta-G (enthalpy, kcal/mol). It should be noted that the more negative the number or value of the docking score is, the stronger is the predicted binding energy at the BRD4 site that recognizes the acetyl lysine of chromatin. We assayed CAL101, a known PI3K inhibitor (selective for the delta isoform) and the only FDA-approved PI3K inhibitor, and showed no significant BRD4 inhibition (>50,000 nm). The in silico model showed that CAL101 could not bind to the BRD4-BD1 acetyl-lysine site confirming the observed assay results providing further support for the value of the in silico model for predicting binding potentials of the compounds of the invention with the BRD4 protein structure. It should be noted that in this model LY294002 gives a binding value of −9.66. In Tables 1-4 and 6-10, a value of 0 (zero) means none of the top-ten best predicted binding poses For a compound could bind at the BRD4 acetyl-lysine recognition cavity with the established binding conformation. An entry of N/A indicates that no molecular modeling was performed and, consequently, there is no available data to include in the table. Taken together, the results of Table 5 (PI3K inhibition) with the BRD4 binding data (Tables 1-4 and 6-10) demonstrate that compounds of Formula I-VII are inhibitors of PI3K, or inhibitors of bromodomains (illustrated by BRD4 inhibition), or dual inhibitors of both PI3K and bromodomains such as BRD4. EXAMPLE 3 Conversion of Compounds from Carbonyl (M=O) to Thiocarbonyl (Thione, M=S) A 2 mL conical microwave vial is charged with a magnetic stirring bar, 488 μmol of carbonyl containing compound of Formula I-VII (M=O), Lawesson's reagent (118 mg, 293 μmol), and toluene (2 mL). The reaction mixture is sealed, and the reaction mixture is magnetically stirred and is heated via microwave irradiation at 130° C. for 20 min. The final mixture is poured onto water (approximately 30 mL) and is extracted with dichloromethane (3×5 mL). The combined extracts is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, is filtered, and is concentrated to dryness. The crude reaction mixture is then purified via column chromatography. Elution of the silica gel column is performed with a mix of hexanes/ethyl acetate (1:1). Elution is continued with 100% ethyl acetate to afforded pure thione (Formula I-VII, M=S).
