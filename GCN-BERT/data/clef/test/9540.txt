The present invention relates to a lighting device, and more particularly, to a lighting-emitting diode (LED) lighting device that prevents a light output and a lifespan of an LED element from being deteriorated and emits uniform lighting without glaring and optical attenuation with a convection dissipation type frame rapidly dissipating heat by using the LED element as a light source. [Background Art] In recent years, the LED element has been in the spotlight as a light source of diversified lighting devices. The LED element has advantages such as a lower heat dissipating amount, lower power consumption, a longer lifespan, higher impact-resistance, and the like than a known lighting source. Further, during manufacturing, since mercury or discharging gas is not used like a 00fluorescent lamp, the LED element has an advantage of not causing environmental pollution. In the case in which appropriate power is supplied and an appropriate heat dissipating unit is provided to the LED element, although the LED element is used for 0.1 million hours or longer, the LED element can main a lighted state without any damage. Optical outputs of all light sources decrease gradually as time elapses. Since people cannot tell the difference at 80% of initial light intensity, the lifespan of the lighting LED element is presently expected to be approximately 40 to 50 thousand hours. Therefore, the LED element may be a much longer lifespan light source than an incandescent lamp having a lifespan of 1500 hours and the fluorescent lamp having a lifespan of i0 thousand hours. However, when a driving current of the LED element increases in order to acquire a high-luminance, high-power lighting source, the power loss of the LED element increases, as a result, most of electric energy is converted into heat and a junction portion of the LED element is in a high-temperature state. Even though a current flowing through the LED element is uniform, when the temperature of the junction portion increases, the LED element has characteristics in that an optical output and optical efficiency thereof deteriorate and the operating lifespan thereof decreases. Accordingly, in order to improve lighting performance and the lighting lifespan, heat generated from the junction portion of the LED element must be discharged to the outside as quickly as possible. In order to solve the problem, in the related art, a high-luminance LED element is mounted on a front surface of an integrated metallic housing in which cooling fins are formed on the circumference of a main body in diversified heat dissipating structures and a semicircular ivory diffusion cover is covered thereon to manufacture an LED lighting lamp. However, such a scheme has a problem in that a projection angle of the LED light source, optical attenuation increases by the ivory white diffusion cover to decrease illumination and thermal accumulation occurs in the diffusion cover to easily deteriorate the LED element, to thereby change a lighting color or shorten the lifespan. Further, a general bulb type LED lighting lamp has a problem in that since a DC power supply, a metallic heat dissipating housing, a high-luminance LED element mounted on a front surface of the housing, and an ivory white diffusion cover are integrally joined to each other during manufacturing, when the illumination of an LED light source deteriorates, the LED element and the DC power supply integrally and elaborately mounted on the metallic housing are very difficult to replace, as a result, the entire product is generally discarded, thereby producing wastes and wasting resources. Further, the LED element is a point light source emitting light in a semiconductor element and a light emitting surface of the LED element has a structure to collect light on a front surface thereof and dissipating the collected light by using a small reflection mirror and an epoxy lens. Accordingly, when the LED element emits light with high luminance in order to increase illumination, the light source is very glaring. Therefore, most of LED lighting lamps are used as the LED lighting lamp by covering the LED element with an ivory white circular diffusion cover or covering the LED light source with a diffused reflection plate made of a translucent material having an irregular uneven curve in order to prevent glaring. The ivory white diffusion cover or irregular uneven diffused reflection plate reduces the quantity of light of the LED element to remarkably decrease illumination due to characteristics of an optical diffusion material and a diffusion reflection structure. Accordingly, additional high-luminance LED elements are mounted on a light source part by considering the reduced quantity of light, as a result, the amount of emitted heat is also doubled. Therefore, a heat radiating function must be further improved to meet the demand. Thus, a manufacturing cost largely increases and the LED lighting device becomes expensive. Meanwhile, convection heat dissipation dissipates heat generated from the device by using a convection phenomenon and the convection heat dissipation represents that cold air introduced into the bottom of the device is heated hot by internal heat of the device and thereafter, discharged to the top by natural convection to prevent the device from being overheated. [Discosure] [Technical Problem] The present invention is contrived to solve the problems and an embodiment of the present invention provides a lamp type LED lighting device that can rapidly discharges heat generated from an LED element that influences an optical output and a lifespan of the LED lighting device through a lamp type frame having a convection heat dissipation structure in which ventilation is smooth, and prevent an LED light source from glaring and widely diffuse a light source without optical attenuation by using a side reflection member and a diffusion lens and a diffusion cover. Another embodiment of the present invention provides line type and panel type LED lighting devices that can replace the existing fluorescent lamp and panel type lighting device by rapidly discharging heat generated from an LED element that influences an optical output and a lifespan of the LED lighting device through a frame having smooth line type and panel type structures in which a heat dissipating operation is smooth, and preventing an LED light source from glaring and widely diffusing a light source without optical attenuation by optically placing a curved reflection plate with a diffusion lens and a diffusion plate and a diffusion window.

The socket 12 includes a positive electrode connection terminal 12a and a negative electrode connection terminal 12b to supply a power to the power supply module unit 40 to be described later as shown in FIG. 2. The heat dissipating frame 20 includes a frame body 21 that is hollow and preferably has a radial shape to make convection heat dissipation smooth, at least three side reflecting units 22 formed outside the frame body 21, and a ventilation unit 23 formed at a portion where the end of the side reflecting unit 22 contacts as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. Inside the frame body 21, a power supply module fixing groove 21a which the power supply module unit 40 to be described later slides to be inserted into and fixed to formed as shown in FIG. 3 and outside of the frame body a ground hole 21b which the LED connection terminal 34 of the LED module 30 to be described later is inserted into and fixed to is formed as shown in FIG. 2. The ground hole 21b is connected with the power supply module unit 40 to be described later. Since an inner part of the frame body 21 hollow, the inner part serves as a movement passage of air (see FIG. 9) to cool heat generated from the LED module to be described later. The frame body 21 can be transformed to various types of polygonal shapes on the basis of the shape of FIG. 3 as shown in FIG. 4. The side reflecting unit 22 is a location where the side reflecting member 50 is installed as shown in FIG. 3 and the end of the side reflecting unit 22 is preferably bent to support the side reflecting member The ventilation unit 23 allows heat generated from the power supply module unit 40 and the LED module 30 to be described later to be rapidly discharged to the outside and at least one ventilation hole 23a is preferably formed in the ventilation unit 23 as shown in FIG. 2. The LED module 30 is preferably installed outside the heat dissipating frame 20 as shown in FIG. 2 and connected with the power supply module unit 40 to be described later to emit an LED light source. The LED module 30 includes a module base 31, at least one LED element 32 fixed to one side of the module base 31 and having an LED emission surface 32a, a resistor 33 installed between the LED elements 32, and an LED connection terminal 34 installed at one side of the module base 31 and inserted into the ground hole 21b of the heat dissipating frame as shown in FIG. On the LED emission surface 32a of the LED element 32, the periphery of the boring hole 51a of the side reflecting member 50 to be described later is preferably supported to allow heat accumulated on the LED emission surface 32a to be absorbed in the side reflecting member as shown in FIG. 3. The power supply module unit 40 includes a power supply module PCB 41 sliding-inserted into a power supply module fixing groove 21a of the heat dissipating frame and a power supply module 42 fixed to the power supply module PCB 41 and converting AC power applied through the socket 12 as shown in FIG. 3.

A prism 52a is formed in the diffusion lens 52 to full-reflect (see FIG. 9) the light source generated from the LED module 30 as shown in FIG. 3. The full-reflection represents a phenomenon in which when light is progressed from a material having optically large refractivity to a material having optically small refractivity, light incident at an incident angle larger than a predetermined threshold angle is not refracted but fully reflected and the minimum value of the incident angle at which the fullreflection may occur is referred to as the threshold angle. For example, a threshold angle at which light is progressed from glass to air is 42 degrees and if the incident angle is larger than 42 degrees, light cannot transmit the glass and is fully reflected on the inner surface of the glass not to be progressed to air. The phenomenon is referred to as the full-reflection and the full-reflection prism 52a uses such a property.

The light source generated from the LED module 30 is diffused to surrounding areas by the diffusion lens 52 as shown in FIG. 9 and some light sources are full-reflected by the prism 52a. The full-reflected or diffused light source forms multiple reflections by a reflection surface of a ceiling mounted lamp device buried in a ceiling, and the like and is irradiated to the outside to become soft downlight lighting as shown in FIG. 8. In this case, heat generated from the LED module cooled by external air inputted through the frame cover hole 61 formed in the frame cover 60 and is rapidly discharged to the outside through the ventilation hole 23a formed in the ventilation unit 23 as shown in FIG. i0. Furthermore, since the periphery of the boring hole 51a of the base plate 51 is supported on the LED emission surface 32a of the LED element 32, the heat accumulated on the LED emission surface 32a is transferred to the base plate 51 on the periphery of the boring hole 51a to acquire a cooling effect.

The insertion-type connection terminal is used when two line-shaped LED lighting devices 200 according to the embodiment of the present invention are connected to each other (see FIG. 22). The LED module 220 is installed in the upper space part 211a of the frame body 211 as shown in FIG. 17 and connected to the power supply module unit 270 to be described later to emit the LED light source. The LED module 220 includes a module base 221 installed on the bottom of the upper space part 211a of the frame body 211, at least one LED element 222 fixed to one side of the module base 221 and having an LED emission surface 222a, a resistor 223 installed between the LED elements 222, and an LED connection terminal 224 installed at one side of the module base 221, which an LED power supply connection terminal 261 and a common terminal 262 of the side cover 260 are inserted into and fixed to. On the LED emission surface 222a of the LED element 222, the periphery of the boring hole 231a of the side reflecting member 230 to be described later is preferably supported to allow heat accumulated on the LED emission surface 222a to be absorbed in the side reflecting member 230 as shown in FIG. 19. The curved reflecting plate 230 is installed in the upper space part 211a of the base frame 210 to diffuse and refract a light source emitted from the LED module 220 as shown in FIGS. 16 and 17. The curved reflecting plate 230 includes a base plate 231 of which both ends are supported on the supporting protrusion 213 of the base frame 210 and where at least one boring hole 231a is formed at a location thereof corresponding to the LED element 222 and a diffusion lens 232 installed in the base plate 231 to be positioned on a straight line with the LED element 222 as shown in FIG. 17. The periphery of the boring hole 231a of the base plate 231 is preferably supported on the LED emission surface 222a to absorb heat accumulated on the LED emission surface 222a as shown in FIG. 19. A light source emitted from the top of the LED element 222 is absorbed in constituent components of the LED module 220 or the base frame 210 to prevent light from being attenuated. Further, heat emitted from the top of the LED element 222 can be rapidly discharged through the bottom of the curved reflecting plate 230 supported on the periphery of each LED emission surface 222a. A prism 232a is formed in the diffusion lens 232 to full-reflect the light source generated from the LED module 220 as shown in FIG. 17. The full-reflection represents a phenomenon in which when light is progressed from a material having optically large refractivity to a material having optically small refractivity, light incident at an incident angle larger than a predetermined threshold angle is not refracted but fully reflected and the minimum value of the incident angle at which the full-reflection may occur is referred to as the threshold angle. For example, a threshold angle at which light is progressed from glass to air is 42 degrees and if the incident angle larger than 42 degrees, light cannot transmit the glass and fully reflected on the inner surface of the glass not be progressed to air. The phenomenon is referred as the full-reflection and the full-reflection prism 232a uses such a property. The surface of the curved reflecting member preferably plated with chrome or nickel in order improve reflection and diffusion efficiencies. The end of the diffusion plate 240 is supported on the supporting protrusion 213 of the base frame and a toothed lens 241 and a diffusion prism 242 are formed on a surface the diffusion plate 240 opposed the diffusion lens 232 in order to improve reflection and diffusion efficiencies as shown in FIG. 17. It is preferable to insert a color sheet (not shown) between the diffusion plate 240 and the diffusion window 250 to be described later to express soft color lighting depending on a lighting usage. The diffusion window 250 is preferably fixed to a diffusion window supporting groove 214 of the base frame 210 by a diffusion window supporting protrusion 250b and a lenticular lens 250a in which a plurality of plano-convex lenses are arranged in parallel is installed on the inner bottom of the diffusion window 250 as shown in FIG. 17. The lenticular lens 250a allows refraction and reflection to be more variously made in the diffusion window 250 to implement an efficient diffusion operation. It is preferable that an ivory white diffusion material is included in the diffusion window 250 in order to acquire softer lighting. The diffusion window 250 may be selectively used depending on a lighting usage. That is, the diffusion window 250 is removed and only the diffusion plate 240 may be used depending on a usage of the lighting device. In this case, the diffusion plate 240 is preferably coupled to the supporting protrusion 213 of the base frame 210 by using a screw or an appropriate supporting member in order to improve fixity. The side cover 260 is preferably screwed or fitted in the side of the base frame 210 to be attached and detached as shown in FIG. 16. The LED power supply connection terminal 261 and the common terminal 262 are mounted on the inner part of the side cover 260 and terminal holes 263 connected with the LED power supply connection terminal 261 and the common terminal 262 are formed in the inner part of the side cover 260. The side cover 260 serves to connect a power inputted from the power supply module unit 270 to be described later to the LED module 220. In detail, the power inputted from the power supply module unit 270 is connected to the terminal hole 263 of the side cover 260 by the projection-type connection terminal 215a of the base frame 210. The terminal hole 263 is connected to the LED power supply connection terminal 261 and the common terminal 262 and since the LED power supply connection terminal 261 and the common terminal 262 are inserted into and fixed to the LED connection terminal 224 of the LED module 220, the power inputted from the power supply module unit 270 is supplied to the LED module 220. As described above, in the line-shaped LED lighting device 200 according to the embodiment of the present invention, since a plurality of LED lighting devices can be connected to each other in series without additional connection wires by using a power connection method through the side cover 260, the lighting device can easily and simply established. Further, in the line-shaped LED lighting device 200 according to the embodiment of the present invention, when the illumination deteriorates, the LED module 220 can be easily replaced by separating the side cover 260 from the base frame 210. As a result, the line-shaped LED lighting device 200 according to the embodiment of the present invention is used semipermanently, to thereby mitigate the dissipation of resources and contribute to environmental protection. The power supply module unit 270 includes a power supply module housing 271 fixed to the LED power supply connection terminal 261 of the side cover 260, an AC inlet 272 installed at one side of the power supply module housing 271 and allowing an external power to be introduced, and a power supply module (not shown) converting the applied AC power as shown in FIGS. 15 to 17. The optical sensor 280 is installed at one side of the power supply module unit 270 as shown in FIG. 15 and senses the amount of surrounding light to transfer a signal to a control unit (not shown) installed in the power supply module unit 270. The control unit controls the illumination of the LED module 220 by using the signal transferred from the optical sensor 280. Since the abovementioned controlling method employs the related art, a detailed description thereof will be omitted. The frame supporting unit 290 includes a frame supporting body 291 coupled to be attach to and detached from the bottom of the base frame 210, at least one heat dissipating pin 292 fixed to the side of the frame supporting body 291, and at least one ventilation hole 293 formed on the side of the frame supporting body 291 to communicated with the frame ventilation hole 212 of the base frame 210 as shown in FIGS. 15 and 16. The heat dissipating pin 292 discharges heat generated by the LED element 222 and accumulated in the base frame 210 to the outside. Further, the heat generated from the LED element 222 passes through the lower space part 211b which is a lower heat dissipating space of the base frame 210 and is easily discharged to the outside through the frame ventilation hole 212 and the ventilation hole 293 of the frame supporting unit 290 by ventilation. As a result, the heat of the LED element 222 may be discharged more rapidly than that of the known LED lighting device. Further, since the frame supporting unit 290 supports the base frame 210, the base frame 210 may be manufactured more simply and economically and the frame supporting unit 290 may be efficiently used as a mounting stand at the time of installing or connecting the lighting device. FIG. 20 is a front cross-sectional view showing diffusion and refraction operations of the line-shaped LED lighting device shown in FIG. The light source generated from the LED module 220 diffused to surrounding areas by the diffusion lens 232 as shown in FIG. 20 and some light sources are fullreflected by the prism 232a. The full-reflected or diffused light source forms semicircular reflection by the base plate 231 of the curved reflecting plate 230. The semicircular light source is refracted and reflected more variously by the lenticular lens 250a of the diffusion window 250 to be discharged to the outside. In this case, the heat generated from the LED element 220 passes through the lower space part 211b which the lower heat dissipating space of the base frame 210 and is rapidly discharged to the outside through the frame ventilation hole 212 and the ventilation hole 293 of the frame supporting unit 290. Furthermore, since the periphery of the boring hole 231a of the base plate 231 is supported on the LED emission surface 222a of the LED element 222, the heat accumulated on the LED emission surface 222a is transferred to the base plate 231 on the periphery of the boring hole 231a to acquire a cooling effect. FIGS. 21 to 22 are usage state diagrams of the lineshaped LED lighting device shown in FIG. FIG. 21 shows a high-luminance lighting device by mounting four line-shaped LED lighting devices 200 according to an embodiment of the present invention on one power supply module unit 270. As described above, in the case of the line-shaped LED lighting devices 200 according to the embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to acquire a desired light amount by connecting one or more line-shaped LED lighting devices 200 to one power supply module unit 270 depending on a lighting usage. Further, in the line-shaped LED lighting device 200 according to the embodiment of the present invention, when the illumination deteriorates, the LED module 220 is separated from he power supply module unit 270 to be easily replaced, the lineshaped LED lighting device 200 may be used semipermanently. FIG. 22 is a diagram showing a case in which five line-shaped LED lighting devices 200 are connected to one power supply module unit 270 in series and for convenience of a drawing space, a partial connection section of the line-shaped LED lighting device 200 is displayed as an additional power supply connector 295. When the lineshaped LED lighting device 200 according to the embodiment of the present invention elongates in a straight direction, the projection-type connection terminal 215a is connected to an insertion terminal (not shown) of another adjacent line-shaped LED lighting device 200, and as a result, an additional extending power supply connector 295 is not required. The line-shaped LED lighting device 200 according to the embodiment of the present invention may be used in various forms by using modifying the method of using the lighting device shown in FIGS. 21 and 22. A panel-shaped LED lighting device 300 according to an embodiment of the present invention rapidly and effectively discharges heat generated from LED elements 332 at the time when the LED elements 332 constituting an LED module 330 emit light with high luminance and high power to increase optical output and optical efficiency, and remarkably extend the lifespan thereof and effectively prevent a glaring phenomenon by high-luminance light emission of the LED elements 332 and widely diffuse the light of the LED elements 332 without attenuation as shown in FIGS. 23 to 29. As shown in FIGS. 23 to 27, the panelshaped LED lighting device 300 includes heat dissipating plates 310 in which recessed portions 311 and projected portions 312 are continuously formed and light source mounting grooves 313 are formed in the projected portions 312, respectively, power supply controllers 320 installed on the heat dissipating plates 310, LED modules 330 mounted on the light source mounting grooves 313 of the heat dissipating plates 310 and electrically connected to the power supply controllers 320 to flicker on and off by controls from the power supply controllers 320, reflecting plates 340 in which curved reflecting portions 341 coupled to front surfaces of the heat dissipating plates 310 and having downward semicircular cross sections are formed continuously to correspond to the light source mounting grooves 313 and the bottoms of the curved reflecting portions 341 are bored to correspond to the LED modules 330, semicircular diffusion lenses 350 installed on the front bottoms of the curved reflecting portions 341 of the reflecting plates 340 and covering emission surfaces of the LED modules 330, and diffusion plates 360 coupled to the front surfaces of the reflecting plates 340 and covering the front surfaces of the reflecting plates 340. Herein, the heat dissipating plates 310 form a rear panel of the panel-shaped LED lighting device 300 according to the embodiment of the present invention and discharges heat generated when the LED modules 330 to be described later emit light with high luminance and high power to the outside through heat exchange with external air. The heat dissipating plates 310 are formed by a metal plate so that the recessed portions 311 and the projected portions 312 are continuously formed to show a good heat dissipating effect through increment of a heat exchange area. The light source mounting grooves 313 are formed at the projected portions 312 of the heat dissipating plates 310. The light source mounting grooves 313 form mounting spaces of the LED modules 330 to be described later and serve to further increase the heat exchange areas of the heat dissipating plates 310. The power supply controller 320 is installed at the recessed portion 311 positioned at the center of the heat dissipating plate 310. The power supply controller 320 supplies a power introduced from the outside to each LED module 330 to control flickering of the LED module 330 and transfer the introduced power to connectors 370a to 370b to be described later. The LED module 330 is mounted at the light source mounting groove 313 of the heat dissipating plate 310. The LED module 330 serves as a light source in the panel-shaped LED lighting device 300 according to the embodiment of the present invention and is electrically connected to the power supply controller 320 to flicker by the control from the power supply controller 320. In the LED module 330, as shown in FIG. 26, a plurality of LED elements 332 are spaced apart from each other on a bar-type printed circuit board 331 and connection terminals 333 for electrically connecting the power supply controller 320 are provided at one side of the bar-type printed circuit board 331. Diversified light emitting circuit elements including resistors are provided on the printed circuit board 331 and the LED elements 332 are preferably formed as an LED package that can emit light with high luminance and the connection terminal 333 is electrically connected to the power supply controller 320 by an additional power supply connector (not shown) to receive the power. In particular, the LED elements 332 that are generally manufactured by packaging a plurality of LEDs in order to acquire a high-luminance lighting light source have a structure to collect light on a front surface and emit the collected light by using a small reflecting mirror and an epoxy lens as a part of an optical design to structurally minimize light loss by opaque components such as a substrate, an electrode, a heat dissipater, and the like. The light sources of the LED elements 332 have various forms of directionalities according to the structures of the reflecting mirror and the epoxy lens. The LED module 330 is merely one embodiment of the LED module 330 used in the LED lighting device 300 according to the embodiment of the present invention and a specialized manufactured power LED module or an AC LED module are configured in a bar type to be used according to the usage or illumination of the LED lighting device. It is preferable that the LED module 330 is replaceably mounted in the light source mounting groove 313 of the heat dissipating plate 310 and this is possible by attach and detach the connection terminal 333 to and from a power supply connection connector (not shown), and as a result, only the LED module 330 having deteriorated illumination is replaced; however, the rest of the components of the LED lighting device 300 can be used semipermanently. The reflecting plate 340 is coupled to the front surface of the heat dissipating plate 310. The reflecting plate 340 serves to reflect the entire light emitted from all the LED elements 332 of the LED module 330 to the front side and is formed by a metal plate so that a lower end of the curved reflecting portion 341 having a downward semicircular cross section is in close contact with the light source mounting groove 313. Further, boring holes 342 corresponding to locations of the emission surfaces of the LED elements 332, respectively are formed on the lower end of the curved reflecting portion 341 so that the light sources of the LED elements 332 arranged on the LED module 330 are projected onto the reflecting plates 340. As a result, the light emitted from the emission surface of the LED element 332 is absorbed in circuit components of the LED module 330 or the printed circuit board (PCB) 331, or a part of a frame not to be attenuated. The inner periphery of the reflecting plate 340 is fitted in an outer portion of the heat dissipating plate 310 so that the boring holes 342 on the lower end of the reflecting plate 340 is supported in contact with the periphery of the emission surface of the LED element 332. As a result, heat discharged to the top of the LED element 332 is rapidly discharged through the bottom of the curved reflecting portion 341 by the boring holes 342 supported on the emission surface of the LED element 332 to thereby increase the optical output and lifespan of the LED element 332. The reflecting plate 340 is further preferably manufactured by forming the metal plate so that the curved reflecting portions 341 are continuously and plating the surface thereof with chrome or nickel so as to maximize light reflection efficiency. The semicircular diffusion lenses 350 are installed on the front bottom of the curved reflecting portions 341 of the reflecting plate 340, respectively to cover the emission surface of the LED module 330. The semicircular diffusion lenses 350 serve to widely diffuse the light of the LED element 332 passing through the boring hole 342 of the reflecting plate 340 semicircularly. An inverted triangular lens surface 351 having a prism shape is formed on the inner surface of the semicircular diffusion lens 350. The inverted triangular lens surface 351 serves to full-reflect the light of the LED element 332 to the curved reflecting portion 341 of the reflecting plate 340 without attenuation by an angle thereof. In particular, it is more advantageous in wide diffusion of the light that a part of the light of the LED element 332 is not progressed straight at the center of the inverted triangular lens surface 351 but full-reflected to the curved reflecting portion 341 of the reflecting plate 340 at the side thereof and thereafter, reflected to the front side by the curved reflecting portion 341 again. In optics, the full-reflection represents a phenomenon in which when light is progressed from a material having optically large refractivity to a material having optically small refractivity, light incident at an incident angle larger than a predetermined threshold angle is not refracted but fully reflected and the minimum value of the incident angle at which the full-reflection may occur is referred to as the threshold angle. For example, a threshold angle at which light is progressed from glass to air is 42 degrees and if the incident angle is larger than 42 degrees, light cannot transmit the glass and is fully reflected on the inner surface of the glass not to be progressed to air. The phenomenon is referred to as the full-reflection and the inverted triangular lens surface 351 of the present invention configures a kind of fullreflection prism to serve to change a progressing direction of light. The diffusion plate 360 is coupled to the front surface of the reflecting plate 340. The diffusion plate 360 covers the front surface of the reflecting plate 340 to form a front panel of the panel-shaped LED lighting device 300 according to the embodiment of the present invention. A toothed diffusion lens 361 in which a plurality of prisms are continuously formed is formed on the bottom of the diffusion plate 360 corresponding to the LED module 330. By using the toothed diffusion lens 361, diffused light reflected by the curved reflecting portion 341 is further diffused by mutual reflection operations between the toothed diffusion lens 361 and the curved reflecting portion 341, such that high-luminance light is not attenuated and glaring can be prevented. Side cover portion 362 covering a side space by the curved reflecting portion 341 are integrally formed on both surfaces of the diffusion plate 360. FIG. 28 is a diagram showing a light diffusion operation of an LED light source in the panel-shaped LED lighting device according to the embodiment of the present invention. The panel-shaped LED lighting device 300 according to the present invention is configured to diffuse highluminance light emitted from the LED element 332 without glaring through multi-stage diffusion operations without attenuation through a 3D combination of the reflecting plate 340, the semicircular diffusion lens 350, and the diffusion plate 360 as shown in FIG. 28 in order to prevent the high-luminance light glare of the LED element 332 which is a semiconductor point light source. To this end, the reflecting plate 340 installed on the top of the LED element 332 is plated with chrome or nickel to form the curved reflecting portion 341 having maximized reflectivity and the semicircular diffusion lens 350 having the inverted triangular lens surface 351 is mounted on the central upper portion of the curved reflecting portion 341, such that the light emitted from the LED element 332 is refracted and diffused through the semicircular diffusion lens 350 having the inverted triangular lens surface 351 and projected to the curved reflecting portion 341 and reflected to the front side and thereafter, a part of the reflected light is re-reflected by the toothed diffusion lens 361 of the diffusion plate 360 positioned on the top thereof to diffuse the light more effectively. Therefore, the light becomes soft illuminating light of which the glare is prevented. Connectors 370a to 370d are preferably installed on sides of the heat dissipating plate 310, which enable extension to a large surface lighting device 400 through power supply connection and interconnections of the panelshaped LED lighting devices 300 according to the present invention by being electrically connected to the power supply controllers 320. FIG. 29 is a schematic structural diagram of a large surface lighting device implemented by connecting four panel-shaped LED lighting devices 300 according to the present invention in horizontal and vertical directions by using the connectors 370a to 370d. As shown in FIG. 29, as the panel-shaped LED lighting device 300 according to the present invention is formed in a square shape and the connectors 370a to 370d are provided at the centers of the sides one at a time, grid-shaped power supply circuits may be implemented between the power supply controller 320 and the connectors 370a to 370d at the center. In this case, the connectors 370a to 370d on four surfaces are connected to each other in pairs of the same electrodes by grid-shaped connection terminals 371. Further, in the case where the panel-shaped LED lighting devices 300 according to the present invention are connected to each other in the horizontal and vertical directions by using the connectors 370a to 370d to extend to the large surface lighting device 400, a generally net type power supply circuit is implemented by power supply circuits. Since no potential difference is generated among the LED lighting devices 300 connected to each other due to a characteristic of the net type serial/parallel power supply circuit, even when the large surface lighting device 400 is constructed by extending a large number of panel type LED lighting devices 300, there is no difference in illumination on the whole, as a result, it is possible to achieve uniform lighting. The panel-shaped LED lighting device 300 according to the present invention may be used for a ceiling lighting device in itself by replacing the existing ceiling lighting lamp and is easily extended in the horizontal and vertical directions to be used as the large surface lighting device 400. In this case, it is possible to easily connect the external power supply at the time of installing the lighting device through the connectors 370a to 370d and extend the lighting device in the horizontal and vertical direction without an additional connection wire by interconnecting the connectors 370a to 370d even at the time of constructing the large surface lighting device 400 on a ceiling or a wall.
