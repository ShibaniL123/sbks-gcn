FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to golf balls having one or more core layers, where the outermost core surface has a Shore C hardness of greater than 85 and the core has a “positive hardness gradient” of less than 22 Shore C. The core is generally a one- or two-piece core. The inner cover layer has a hardness of greater than the outer cover layer and is within 5 Shore C of the hardness of the core surface. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Numerous golf balls having a multilayer construction wherein the core hardness and cover hardness have been variously improved are disclosed in the prior art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,987,159 to Iwami discloses a solid golf ball with a solid core and a polyurethane cover, wherein the difference in Shore D hardness between a center portion and a surface portion of the solid core is at least 15, the polyurethane cover has a thickness (t) of not more than 1.0 mm and is formed from a cured urethane composition having a Shore D hardness (D) of from 35 to 60, and a product of t and D ranges from 10 to 45. U.S. Pat. No. 7,175,542 to Watanabe et al. discloses a multi-piece solid golf ball composed of a multilayer core having at least an inner core layer and an outer core layer, one or more cover layers which enclose the core, and numerous dimples formed on a surface of the cover layer. The golf ball is characterized in that the following hardness conditions are satisfied: (1) (JIS-C hardness of cover)−(JIS-C hardness at center of core)≧27, (2) 23≦(JIS-C hardness at surface of core)−(JIS-C hardness at center of core)≦40, and (3) 0.50≦[(deflection amount of entire core)/(deflection amount of inner core layer)]≦0.75. U.S. Pat. No. 6,679,791 to Watanabe discloses a multi-piece golf ball which includes a rubbery elastic core, a cover having a plurality of dimples on the surface thereof, and at least one intermediate layer between the core and the cover. The intermediate layer is composed of a resin material which is harder than the cover. The elastic core has a hardness which gradually increases radially outward from the center to the surface thereof. The center and surface of the elastic core have a hardness difference of at least 18 JIS-C hardness units. U.S. Pat. No. 5,782,707 to Yamagishi et al. discloses a three-piece solid golf ball consisting of a solid core, an intermediate layer, and a cover, wherein the hardness is measured by a JIS-C scale hardness meter, the core center hardness is up to 75 degrees, the core surface hardness is up to 85 degrees, the core surface hardness is higher than the core center hardness by 8 to 20 degrees, the intermediate layer hardness is higher than the core surface hardness by at least 5 degrees, and the cover hardness is lower than the intermediate layer hardness by at least 5 degrees. Additional examples can be found, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,686,436 to Iwami, U.S. Pat. No. 6,786,836 to Higuchi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,153,224 to Higuchi et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 7,226,367 to Higuchi et al. The present invention provides a novel multilayer golf ball construction which may provide one or more of the following benefits: lower spin due to a relatively high core gradient, higher spin on full iron shots due to an outer core surface which is harder than the inner cover surface, and superior overall ball performance properties. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a golf ball formed from a single, solid core, an inner cover layer, and an outer cover layer. The solid core is preferably unitary and homogeneous (i.e., formed from a single composition, such as a polybutadiene composition) and can have any diameter, but preferably the outer diameter is about 1.5 to 1.62 inches, more preferably about 1.51 to 1.60 inches, and most preferably about 1.53 to 1.58 inches. The solid core has a surface hardness and a geometric center hardness. The geometric center hardness is preferably about 64 to 85 Shore C and the core surface hardness is preferably greater than 85 Shore C. The core surface hardness is more preferably about 86 to 98 Shore C and most preferably about 88 to 94 Shore C. The core surface hardness is higher (harder) than the geometric center hardness by about 5 to 22 Shore C to define a medium positive hardness gradient. Preferably the hardness gradient is about 7 to 20 Shore C, more preferably about 10 to 18 Shore C. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the geometric center hardness is about 75 Shore C and the core surface hardness is about 89 Shore C to define a medium positive hardness gradient of about 14 Shore C. In this embodiment, the outer cover layer is formed from a polyurea, a polyurethane, or a hybrid thereof, and has a first hardness, and the inner cover layer has a second hardness greater than the first (cover) hardness and is within about 5 Shore C of the core surface hardness. The present invention is also directed to a golf ball formed from a solid dual core (formed from an inner core layer and an outer core layer), an inner cover layer, and an outer cover layer. The inner core layer has a geometric center hardness of about 66 to 80 Shore C and a surface hardness of about 65 to 80 Shore C and is about 0 to 5 Shore C, preferably about 1 to 5 Shore C, harder than the center hardness to define a shallow positive hardness gradient. The outer core layer preferably has a surface hardness of about 86 to 96 Shore C and is harder than the geometric center by about 10 to 20 Shore C to define a positive hardness gradient.

The outer core layer preferably has a surface hardness of about 86 to 96 Shore C, and is harder than the geometric center by about 10 to 20 Shore C to define a “positive hardness gradient.” The positive hardness gradient is more preferably about 12 to 18 Shore C, and most preferably about 13 to 16 Shore C. The outer core layer may also include a stiffening thermoplastic polymer, The outer cover layer is preferably formed from a polyurea, a polyurethane, or a hybrid thereof. The outer cover layer should have a Vicker's hardness of about 0.18 to 0.40, as measured on the ball at 0.49 N with a 10-s hold time. The inner cover layer is preferably formed from an ionomer or ionomer blend, and is generally disposed between the core and the outer cover layer. The present invention is also directed to a golf ball having an inner core layer, an outer core layer, and at least one cover layer. The inner core layer has a first surface hardness and a geometric center hardness, the center hardness being less than the first surface hardness to define a first positive hardness gradient of about 1 to 12 Shore C. The outer core layer has a second surface hardness. The cover layer is formed over the outer core layer.

In an alternative embodiment, the hardness gradient of the inner core layer is about 1 to 5 Shore D. The cover layer may include a polyurea, a polyurethane, or a hybrid thereof. In one embodiment, cover layer includes an inner cover layer and an outer cover layer. If so, the inner cover layer is typically formed from an ionomer and the outer cover layer is formed from a polyurethane. In one embodiment, the inner cover layer is harder than the outer cover layer. The outer cover may, alternatively, be harder than the inner cover. In one embodiment, the second positive hardness gradient is about 13 to 21 Shore C, more preferably about 14 to 20 Shore C.

The first positive hardness gradient has a first slope S1. The golf ball also includes an outer core layer having a second surface hardness of about 86 to 91 Shore C, and a cover layer disposed about the outer core layer. The surface hardness of the outer core layer is typically greater than the geometric center hardness to define a second positive hardness gradient of about 16 to 19 Shore C.

FIG. 1 is a representative cross section of a golf ball of the invention; and FIG. 2 depicts representative hardness measurements (in Shore C) across a dual core, the first derivatives for both the inner and outer core layers, and the angle, θ, formed at the intersection of the linear regression lines. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION A golf ball having a dual core (i.e., two-layer core) and a dual cover (i.e., two-layer cover) enclosing the core is disclosed. The dual core consists of a center and an outer core layer. The center has a diameter within a range having a lower limit of 0.75 or 1.00 or 1.10 or 1.20 inches and an upper limit of 1.30 or 1.35 or 1.40 inches. The outer core layer encloses the center such that the two-layer core has an overall diameter within a range having a lower limit of 1.40 or 1.50 or 1.51 or 1.52 or 1.525 inches and an upper limit of 1.54 or 1.55 or 1.555 or 1.56 or 1.59 inches. Preferably, the center has a center hardness of 50 Shore C or greater, or 55 Shore C or greater, or 60 Shore C or greater, or a center hardness within a range having a lower limit of 50 or 55 or 60 Shore C and an upper limit of 65 or 70 or 80 Shore C. The center preferably has a surface hardness of 65 Shore C or greater, or 70 Shore C or greater, or a surface hardness within a range having a lower limit of 55 or 60 or 65 or 70 Shore C or 75 Shore C and an upper limit of 80 or 85 Shore C. The outer core layer preferably has a surface hardness of 75 Shore C or greater, or 80 Shore C or greater, or greater than 80 Shore C, or 85 Shore C or greater, or greater than 85 Shore C, or 87 Shore C or greater, or greater than 87 Shore C, or 90 Shore C or greater, or greater than 90 Shore C, or a surface hardness within a range having a lower limit of 75 or 80 or 85 or 90 Shore C and an upper limit of 95 Shore C. In a particular embodiment, the surface hardness of the center is greater than or equal to the center hardness of the center. In another particular embodiment, the center has a positive hardness gradient wherein the surface hardness of the center is at least 10 Shore C units greater than the center hardness of the center. In a particular embodiment, the surface hardness of the outer core layer is greater than or equal to the surface hardness and center hardness of the center. In another particular embodiment, the core has a positive hardness gradient wherein the surface hardness of the outer core layer is at least 20 Shore C units greater, or at least 25 Shore C units greater, or at least 30 units greater, than the center hardness of the center. The surface hardness of a center or outer core layer is obtained from the average of a number of measurements taken from opposing hemispheres of a core, taking care to avoid making measurements on the parting line of the core or on surface defects, such as holes or protrusions. Hardness measurements are made pursuant to ASTM D-2240 “Indentation Hardness of Rubber and Plastic by Means of a Durometer.” Because of the curved surface of a core, care must be taken to insure that the core is centered under the durometer indentor before a surface hardness reading is obtained. A calibrated, digital durometer, capable of reading to 0.1 hardness units is used for all hardness measurements and is set to take hardness readings at 1 second after the maximum reading is obtained. The digital durometer must be attached to, and its foot made parallel to, the base of an automatic stand, such that the weight on the durometer and attack rate conform to ASTM D-2240. The center hardness of the core is obtained according to the following procedure. The core is gently pressed into a hemispherical holder having an internal diameter approximately slightly smaller than the diameter of the core, such that the core is held in place in the hemispherical portion of the holder while concurrently leaving the geometric central plane of the core exposed. The core is secured in the holder by friction, such that it will not move during the cutting and grinding steps, but the friction is not so excessive that distortion of the natural shape of the core would result. The core is secured such that the parting line of the core is roughly parallel to the top of the holder. The diameter of the core is measured 90° to this orientation prior to securing. A measurement is also made from the bottom of the holder to the top of the core to provide a reference point for future calculations. A rough cut is made slightly above the exposed geometric center of the core using a band saw or other appropriate cutting tool, making sure that the core does not move in the holder during this step. The remainder of the core, still in the holder, is secured to the base plate of a surface grinding machine. The exposed ‘rough’ surface is ground to a smooth, flat surface, revealing the geometric center of the core, which can be verified by measuring the height of the bottom of the holder to the exposed surface of the core, making sure that exactly half of the original height of the core, as measured above, has been removed to within ±0.004 inches. Leaving the core in the holder, the center of the core is found with a center square and carefully marked and the hardness is measured at the center mark. The center is preferably formed from a rubber composition or from a highly resilient thermoplastic polymer such as a highly neutralized polymer (“HNP”) composition. Particularly suitable thermoplastic polymers include SURLYN® ionomer resins, HYTREL® thermoplastic polyester elastomers, and ionomeric materials sold under the tradenames HPF 1000 and HPF 2000, all of which are commercially-available from DuPont (“DuPont”); IOTEK® ionomers, commercially-available from ExxonMobil Chemical Company; and PEBAX® thermoplastic polyether block amides, commercially-available from Arkema Inc. Suitable HNP compositions for use in forming the center comprise an HNP and optionally additives, fillers, and/or melt flow modifiers. Suitable HNPs are salts of homopolymers and copolymers of α,β-ethylenically unsaturated mono- or dicarboxylic acids, and combinations thereof, optionally including a softening monomer. The acid polymer is neutralized to 70% or higher, including up to 100%, with a suitable cation source. Suitable additives and fillers include, for example, blowing and foaming agents, optical brighteners, coloring agents, fluorescent agents, whitening agents, UV absorbers, light stabilizers, defoaming agents, processing aids, mica, talc, nanofillers, antioxidants, stabilizers, softening agents, fragrance components, plasticizers, impact modifiers, acid copolymer wax, surfactants; inorganic fillers, such as zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, tin oxide, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, barium sulfate, zinc sulfate, calcium carbonate, zinc carbonate, barium carbonate, mica, talc, clay, silica, lead silicate, and the like; high specific gravity metal powder fillers, such as tungsten powder, molybdenum powder, and the like; regrind, i.e., core material that is ground and recycled; and nano-fillers. Suitable melt flow modifiers include, for example, fatty acids and salts thereof, polyamides, polyesters, polyacrylates, polyurethanes, polyethers, polyureas, polyhydric alcohols, and combinations thereof. Suitable HNP compositions also include blends of HNPs with partially neutralized ionomers as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,652,086, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference, and blends of HNPs with additional thermoplastic and thermoset materials, including, but not limited to, ionomers, acid copolymers, engineering thermoplastics, fatty acid/salt-based highly neutralized polymers, polybutadienes, polyurethanes, polyesters, thermoplastic elastomers, and other conventional polymeric materials. Particularly suitable as a core layer material is HPF 1000. Suitable HNP compositions are further disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,653,382, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. Suitable rubber compositions for use in forming the center comprise a base rubber, a crosslinking agent, a filler, and a co-crosslinking or initiator agent. Typical base rubber materials include natural and synthetic rubbers, and combinations of two or more thereof. The base rubber is preferably polybutadiene or a mixture of polybutadiene with other elastomers. Particularly preferred is 1,4-polybutadiene having a cis-structure of at least 40%. More preferably, the base rubber is a high-Mooney-viscosity rubber. Lesser amounts of other thermoset materials may be incorporated into the base rubber. Such materials include, for example, cis-polyisoprene, trans-polyisoprene, balata, polychloroprene, polynorbornene, polyoctenamer, polypentenamer, butyl rubber, EPR, EPDM, styrene-butadiene, and similar thermoset materials. The crosslinking agent typically includes a metal salt, such as a zinc-, aluminum-, sodium-, lithium-, nickel-, calcium-, or magnesium-salt, of an unsaturated fatty acid or monocarboxylic acid, such as (meth) acrylic acid. Preferred crosslinking agents include zinc acrylate, zinc diacrylate, zinc methacrylate, and zinc dimethacrylate, and mixtures thereof. The crosslinking agent must be present in an amount sufficient to crosslink a portion of the chains of the polymers in the resilient polymer component. The crosslinking agent is generally present in the rubber composition in an amount of from 15 to 30 phr, or from 19 to 25 phr, or from 20 to 24 phr. The desired compression may be obtained by adjusting the amount of crosslinking, which can be achieved, for example, by altering the type and amount of crosslinking agent. The initiator agent can be any known polymerization initiator which decomposes during the cure cycle, including, but not limited to, dicumyl peroxide, 1,1-di-(t-butylperoxy) 3,3,5-trimethyl cyclohexane, a-a bis-(t-butylperoxy) diisopropylbenzene, 2,5-di-(t-butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethyl hexane, di-t-butyl peroxide, n-butyl-4,4-bis(t-butylperoxy)valerate, lauryl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, and mixtures thereof. The rubber composition optionally contains one or more antioxidants. Antioxidants are compounds that can inhibit or prevent the oxidative degradation of the rubber. Some antioxidants also act as free radical scavengers; thus, when antioxidants are included in the rubber composition, the amount of initiator agent used may be as high or higher than the amounts disclosed herein. Suitable antioxidants include, for example, dihydroquinoline antioxidants, amine type antioxidants, and phenolic type antioxidants. The rubber composition may also contain one or more fillers to adjust the density and/or specific gravity of the core or cover. Fillers are typically polymeric or mineral particles. Exemplary fillers include precipitated hydrated silica, clay, talc, asbestos, glass fibers, aramid fibers, mica, calcium metasilicate, zinc sulfate, barium sulfate, zinc sulfide, lithopone, silicates, silicon carbide, diatomaceous earth, polyvinyl chloride, carbonates (e.g., calcium carbonate, zinc carbonate, barium carbonate, and magnesium carbonate), metals (e.g., titanium, tungsten, aluminum, bismuth, nickel, molybdenum, iron, lead, copper, boron, cobalt, beryllium, zinc, and tin), metal alloys (e.g., steel, brass, bronze, boron carbide whiskers, and tungsten carbide whiskers), oxides (e.g., zinc oxide, tin oxide, iron oxide, calcium oxide, aluminum oxide, titanium dioxide, magnesium oxide, and zirconium oxide), particulate carbonaceous materials (e.g., graphite, carbon black, cotton flock, natural bitumen, cellulose flock, and leather fiber), microballoons (e.g., glass and ceramic), fly ash, regrind (i.e., core material that is ground and recycled), nanofillers and combinations thereof. The amount of particulate material(s) present in the rubber composition is typically within a range having a lower limit of 5 parts or 10 parts by weight per 100 parts of the base rubber, and an upper limit of 30 parts or 50 parts or 100 parts by weight per 100 parts of the base rubber. Filler materials may be dual-functional fillers, such as zinc oxide (which may be used as a filler/acid scavenger) and titanium dioxide (which may be used as a filler/brightener material). Further examples of suitable fillers and additives include, but are not limited to, those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,041,721, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. The rubber composition may also contain one or more additives selected from processing aids, processing oils, plasticizers, coloring agents, fluorescent agents, chemical blowing and foaming agents, defoaming agents, stabilizers, softening agents, impact modifiers, free radical scavengers, accelerators, scorch retarders, and the like. The amount of additive(s) typically present in the rubber composition is typically within a range having a lower limit of 0 parts by weight per 100 parts of the base rubber, and an upper limit of 20 parts or 50 parts or 100 parts or 150 parts by weight per 100 parts of the base rubber. The rubber composition optionally includes a soft-and-fast agent. As used herein, “soft-and-fast agent” means any compound or a blend thereof that is capable of making a core 1) softer (have a lower compression) at a constant coefficient of restitution (“COR”) and/or 2) faster (have a higher COR at equal compression), when compared to a core equivalently prepared without a soft-and-fast agent. Preferably, the rubber composition contains from 0.05 phr to 10.0 phr of a soft-and-fast agent. In one embodiment, the soft-and-fast agent is present in an amount of from 0.05 phr to 3.0 phr, or from 0.05 phr to 2.0 phr, or from 0.05 phr to 1.0 phr.

Referring to FIG. 1, in one embodiment of the present invention the golf ball 10 includes an inner core layer 12, an outer core layer 16, an inner cover layer 14, and an outer cover layer 18. The two-layer core is enclosed with a cover comprising an inner cover layer and an outer cover layer. According to the present invention, the surface hardness of the outer core layer is greater than the material hardness of the inner cover layer. In a particular embodiment, the surface hardness of the outer core layer is greater than both the inner cover layer and the outer cover layer. There are a number of preferred embodiments of the invention. In one preferred embodiment, the golf ball is formed from a single, solid core, an inner cover layer, and an outer cover layer. The solid core is preferably unitary and homogeneous (i.e., formed from a single composition, such as a polybutadiene composition) and can have any diameter, but preferably the outer diameter is about 1.5 inches to about 1.62 inches, more preferably about 1.51 inches to about 1.60 inches, and most preferably about 1.53 to about 1.58 inches. The solid core has a surface hardness and a geometric center hardness. The geometric center hardness is preferably about 64 Shore C to about 85 Shore C and the core surface hardness is preferably greater than 85 Shore C. The core surface hardness is more preferably about 86 Shore C to about 98 Shore C and most preferably about 88 Shore C to about 94 Shore C. The core surface hardness is higher (harder) than the geometric center hardness by about 5 Shore C to about 22 Shore C to define a medium positive hardness gradient. Preferably the hardness gradient is about 7 Shore C to about 20 Shore C, more preferably about 10 Shore C to about 18 Shore C. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the geometric center hardness is about 75 Shore C and the core surface hardness is about 89 Shore C to define a medium positive hardness gradient of about 14 Shore C. In this embodiment, the outer cover layer is formed from a polyurea, a polyurethane, or a hybrid thereof, and has a first hardness, and the inner cover layer has a second hardness greater than the first (cover) hardness and is within about 5 Shore C of the core surface hardness. In an alternative preferred embodiment, the golf ball is formed from a solid dual core (formed from an inner core layer and an outer core layer), an inner cover layer, and an outer cover layer. The inner core layer has a geometric center hardness of about 66 Shore C to about 80 Shore C and a surface hardness of about 65 Shore C to about 80 Shore C and is about 0 to 5 Shore C, preferably about 1 Shore C to about 5 Shore C, harder than the center hardness to define a shallow positive hardness gradient. The outer core layer preferably has a surface hardness of about 86 Shore C to about 96 Shore C and is harder than the geometric center by about 10 Shore C to about 20 Shore C to define a positive hardness gradient. Preferably, the hardness gradient is about 12 Shore C to about 18 Shore C, more preferably about 13 Shore C to about 16 Shore C. Preferably, the geometric center hardness is about 67 Shore C to about 75 Shore C, more preferably about 68 Shore C to about 72 Shore C. The outer core layer surface hardness is preferably about 89 Shore C to about 91 Shore C. In one particularly preferred embodiment, the inner core layer preferably has an outer diameter of about 1.0 inches and the outer core layer has an outer diameter of about 1.55 inches. The inner or outer core layers may also be formed from a polybutadiene rubber and about 1 to 100 phr of a stiffening thermoplastic polymer, such as polyisoprene, trans butadiene rubbers, ionomer, acid co- or ter-polymers, polyamides, polyesters, polyoctenemers, styrene butadiene copolymers, polyether-esters, polyamide-esters, or polyethylene copolymers. The outer cover layer has a Vicker's hardness of about 0.18 to about 0.40, more preferably about 0.2 to about 0.35 as measured on the ball at 0.49 N with a 10-s hold time. The inner cover layer is formed from an ionomer or ionomer-based blend and is typically disposed between the core and the outer cover layer. The inner or outer cover layers may be formed from an ionomer or a blend thereof, a polyurea, a polyurethane, a urethane-urea hybrid, a urea-urethane hybrid, a castable epoxy, a metallocene-catalyzed polyolefin, ionomers, ethylene-acrylic or -methacrylic acid copolymers or terpolymers, highly-neutralized ionomers, thermoset diene rubbers, polyether-esters, polyether-amides, or polyamide-esters. In another preferred embodiment, the golf ball is formed from an inner core layer, an outer core layer, an inner cover layer, and an outer cover layer. The inner core layer has a geometric center hardness of about 66 Shore C to about 82 Shore C and a surface hardness of about 62 Shore C to about 78 Shore C. The surface hardness is lower (softer) than the center hardness to define a “negative hardness gradient.” Preferably, the geometric center hardness is about 70 Shore C to about 80 Shore C and/or the core surface hardness is about 66 Shore C to about 74 Shore C. The outer core layer preferably has a surface hardness of about 86 Shore C to about 96 Shore C, and is harder than the geometric center by about 10 Shore C to about 20 Shore C to define a “positive hardness gradient.” The positive hardness gradient is more preferably about 12 Shore C to 18 Shore C, and most preferably about 13 Shore C to about 16 Shore C. The outer core layer may also include a stiffening thermoplastic polymer, The outer cover layer is preferably formed from a polyurea, a polyurethane, or a hybrid thereof. The outer cover layer should have a Vicker's hardness of about 0.18 to about 0.40, as measured on the ball at 0.49 N with a 10-s hold time. The inner cover layer is preferably formed from an ionomer or ionomer blend, and is generally disposed between the core and the outer cover layer. It should be understood that there is a fundamental difference between “material hardness” and “hardness as measured directly on a golf ball.” For purposes of the present disclosure, material hardness is measured according to ASTM D2240 and generally involves measuring the hardness of a flat “slab” or “button” formed of the material. Hardness as measured directly on a golf ball (or other spherical surface) typically results in a different hardness value. This difference in hardness values is due to several factors including, but not limited to, ball construction (i.e., core type, number of core and/or cover layers, etc.), ball (or sphere) diameter, and the material composition of adjacent layers. It should also be understood that the two measurement techniques are not linearly related and, therefore, one hardness value cannot easily be correlated to the other. The hardness values given herein for cover materials, including inner cover layer materials and outer cover layer materials, are material hardness values, with all values reported following 10 days of aging at 50% relative humidity and 23° C. In an effort to alleviate influence of sub-layers/materials on hardness measurements of thin layers, such as those in a golf ball cover, a microindentation hardness method is also used herein. The Vickers hardness measurements are made according to ASTM E384-09 “Standard Test Method for Microindentation Hardness of Materials.” ASTM E384-09 microindentation tests extend hardness testing to materials too thin or too small for macroindentation tests, such as the Shore-type tests described by ASTM D2240. The pyramid-shaped Vickers indenter leaves a micro-sized indentation containing two ‘marks’ (perpendicular to each other, much like an ‘x-y’ axis, resulting from the edges of the ‘pyramid’) on the surface being tested and a microscope is used to find and measure the diagonals (d1 and d2) of the indentation. The length of the diagonals (d) and the force applied (F, in N or gF) are used to calculate a hardness value for the material, HV (HV=0.102 F/A=0.1891 F/d2, where F is the test load and A is the indentation surface area). Because most of the recovery of the material is in the depth of penetration and not in the diagonals, the Vickers hardness is much less affected by material recovery or lack thereof between measurements (as all too evident in Shore-type measurements). The surface to be measured must be smooth enough that indentations as little as 10 μm (less than half a mil) can be accurately measured. It is also important that the sample be centered and that the surface be parallel to the stage in order to produce a consistent indentation to achieve a reasonably regular tetrahedron. The inner cover layer preferably has a material hardness of 95 Shore C or less, or less than 95 Shore C, or 92 Shore C or less, or 90 Shore C or less, or has a material hardness within a range having a lower limit of 70 or 75 or 80 or 84 or 85 Shore C and an upper limit of 90 or 92 or 95 Shore C. The thickness of the inner cover layer is preferably within a range having a lower limit of 0.010 or 0.015 or 0.020 or 0.030 inches and an upper limit of 0.035 or 0.045 or 0.080 or 0.120 inches. The outer cover layer preferably has a material hardness of 85 Shore C or less. The thickness of the outer cover layer is preferably within a range having a lower limit of 0.010 or 0.015 or 0.025 inches and an upper limit of 0.035 or 0.040 or 0.055 or 0.080 inches. Suitable materials for forming the inner and outer cover layer include ionomer resins and blends thereof (particularly SURLYN® ionomer resins), polyurethanes, polyureas, (meth)acrylic acid, thermoplastic rubber polymers, polyethylene, and synthetic or natural vulcanized rubber, such as balata.

The present invention is not limited by any particular process for forming the golf ball layer(s). It should be understood that the layer(s) can be formed by any suitable technique, including injection molding, compression molding, casting, and reaction injection molding. Golf balls of the present invention typically have a coefficient of restitution of 0.70 or greater, preferably 0.75 or greater, and more preferably 0.78 or greater.

Golf balls of the present invention will typically have dimple coverage of 60% or greater, preferably 65% or greater, and more preferably 75% or greater. The United States Golf Association specifications limit the minimum size of a competition golf ball to 1.680 inches. There is no specification as to the maximum diameter, and golf balls of any size can be used for recreational play. Golf balls of the present invention can have an overall diameter of any size. The preferred diameter of the present golf balls is from 1.680 inches to 1.800 inches. More preferably, the present golf balls have an overall diameter of from 1.680 inches to 1.760 inches, and even more preferably from 1.680 inches to 1.740 inches. Golf balls of the present invention preferably have a moment of inertia (“MOI”) of 70-95 g·cm2, preferably 75-93 g·cm2, and more preferably 76-90 g·cm2. For low MOI embodiments, the golf ball preferably has an MOI of 85 g·cm2 or less, or 83 g·cm2 or less. For high MOI embodiment, the golf ball preferably has an MOI of 86 g·cm2 or greater, or 87 g·cm2 or greater. MOI is measured on a model MOI-005-104 Moment of Inertia Instrument manufactured by Inertia Dynamics of Collinsville, Conn. The instrument is connected to a PC for communication via a COMM port and is driven by MOI Instrument Software version #1.2. Golf ball cores of the present invention preferably have an overall dual-core compression of from 75 to 90, or from 60 to 85, or a compression of about 80. Golf ball centers of the present invention preferably have a compression of 40 or less, or from 20 to 40, or a compression of about 35. Compression is an important factor in golf ball design. For example, the compression of the core can affect the ball's spin rate off the driver and the feel. Several different methods can be used to measure compression, including Atti compression, Riehle compression, load/deflection measurements at a variety of fixed loads and offsets, and effective modulus. For purposes of the present invention, “compression” refers to Atti compression and is measured according to a known procedure, using an Atti compression test device, wherein a piston is used to compress a ball against a spring. The travel of the piston is fixed and the deflection of the spring is measured. The measurement of the deflection of the spring does not begin with its contact with the ball; rather, there is an offset of approximately the first 1.25 mm (0.05 inches) of the spring's deflection. Very low stiffness cores will not cause the spring to deflect by more than 1.25 mm and therefore have a zero compression measurement. The Atti compression tester is designed to measure objects having a diameter of 42.7 mm (1.68 inches); thus, smaller objects, such as golf ball cores, must be shimmed to a total height of 42.7 mm to obtain an accurate reading. Golf ball cores of the present invention preferably have a zero or “positive hardness gradient.” The hardness gradient is defined by hardness measurements made at the surface of the inner core (or outer core layer) and radially inward towards the center of the inner core, typically at 2-mm increments. For purposes of the present invention, the term “positive” with respect to the hardness gradient refers to the result of subtracting the hardness value at the innermost portion of the golf ball component from the hardness value at the outer surface of the component. For example, if the outer surface of a solid core has a higher hardness value than the center (i.e., the surface is harder than the center), the hardness gradient will be deemed a “positive” gradient. Hardness gradients are measured by preparing the core according to the procedure given above for measuring the center hardness of the core. Hardness measurements at any distance from the center of the core are then measured by drawing a line radially outward from the center mark, and measuring and marking the distance from the center, typically in 2-mm increments. All hardness measurements performed on a plane passing through the geometric center are performed while the core is still in the holder and without having disturbed its orientation, such that the test surface is constantly parallel to the bottom of the holder. The hardness difference from any predetermined location on the core is calculated as the average surface hardness minus the hardness at the appropriate reference point, e.g., at the center of the core for a single, solid core, such that a core surface softer than its center will have a “negative hardness gradient” and a core surface harder than its center will have a positive hardness gradient. Hardness gradients are disclosed more fully, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 7,429,221, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. A preferred golf ball is formed from an inner core layer, an outer core layer, and at least one cover layer. The surface hardness of the inner core layer (the ‘first surface hardness’) and the hardness at the geometric center of the inner core layer (the ‘geometric center hardness’) have a relationship such that the geometric center hardness is lower than the hardness at the surface of the inner core layer to define a positive hardness gradient (the ‘first positive hardness gradient’) of about 1 to 12 Shore C. The outer core layer, disposed about the inner core to form a ‘dual core’ also has a surface hardness (the ‘second surface hardness’). The cover layer, which may be one or more layers, is formed over the outer core layer. The second outer surface hardness is preferably greater than the geometric center hardness to define a positive hardness gradient across the dual core (the ‘second positive hardness gradient’) of about 12 to 22 Shore C. The geometric center hardness is typically about 65 to 75 Shore C and the second surface hardness is preferably greater than about 85 Shore C. In one embodiment, the hardness gradient of the inner core layer is about 3 to 10 Shore C, more preferably about 4 to 9 Shore C. In an alternative embodiment, the hardness gradient of the inner core layer is about 1 to 5 Shore D. The cover layer may include a polyurea, a polyurethane, or a hybrid thereof. In one embodiment, cover layer includes an inner cover layer and an outer cover layer. If so, the inner cover layer is typically formed from an ionomer and the outer cover layer is formed from a polyurethane. In one embodiment, the inner cover layer is harder than the outer cover layer. The outer cover may, alternatively, be harder than the inner cover. In one embodiment, the second positive hardness gradient is about 13 to 21 Shore C, more preferably about 14 to 20 Shore C. In one embodiment, the second positive hardness gradient is about 8 to 13 Shore D. The inner core layer preferably has an outer diameter of about 0.75 to 1.35 inches, more preferably about 1.0 to 1.25 inches. In one particularly preferred embodiment, the second hardness gradient increases by less than 10% of the geometric center hardness up to a point about 12 mm radially outward from the geometric center and then increases by an amount greater than 10% of the geometric center hardness at a point about 12 mm from the geometric center to the outer surface. The inventive golf ball may also include an inner core layer having a first surface hardness of about 75 to 79 Shore C and a geometric center hardness, the geometric center hardness being about 69 to 73 Shore C and less than the first surface hardness to define a first positive hardness gradient of about 5 to 9 Shore C. The golf ball also includes an outer core layer having a second surface hardness of about 86 to 91 Shore C, and a cover layer disposed about the outer core layer. The surface hardness of the outer core layer is typically greater than the geometric center hardness to define a second positive hardness gradient of about 16 to 19 Shore C. In one embodiment, the inner core layer comprises an antioxidant and the outer core layer is substantially free from antioxidant. Referring to FIG. 2, in one embodiment the hardness profile is measured on the cross-section of the core by starting at the geometric center and working radially outward in 2-mm increments. Each hardness measurement is recorded with respect to its position relative to the geometric center. Measurements made at the same radial distance from the geometric center, but in different directions, are averaged together. A linear slope (S1) of the hardness profile of the inner core is determined by a linear regression of the hardness values with respect to radial distance that lie within the radius of the inner core. Likewise, a linear slope (S2) of the hardness profile of the outer core layer is determined by a linear regression of the hardness values with respect to radial distance that lie within the outer core layer. The ratio of S2/S1 is preferably greater than about 1.0, more preferably greater than about 5.0, most preferably greater than about 10.0. In one preferred embodiment, the ratio of S2/S1 is from about 15.0 to about 20.0. In FIG. 1, the ratio of S2/S1 is about 19.8. An interpolated hardness curve is generated for the inner core, H1(r) and outer core layer H2(r). This hardness curve is generated from the measured hardness values. From the interpolated curves, the first derivatives H′1(r) and H′2(r) are calculated numerically. The first derivative of the inner core, H′1(r), at any radial distance within the inner core is less than 1.0. The first derivative of the outer core layer, H′2(r), at any radial distance within the outer core is greater than 1.0. The angle, θ, that is formed by the intersection of the linear regression lines of the inner core and outer core layer is defined by: θ = 180 - ( 180 π  ( tan - 1  ( S 2 ) - tan - 1  ( S 1 ) ) ) The angle, θ, is preferably about 90° or greater, more preferably the angle, θ, is about 110° or greater, and most preferably the angle, θ, is about 120° or greater. In one preferred embodiment, the angle, θ, is about 130° or greater. Examples It should be understood that the examples below are for illustrative purposes only. In no manner is the present invention limited to the specific disclosures therein. Twelve ionomeric inner cover layer compositions according to the present invention were prepared by melt blending SURLYN® 8150 and FUSABOND® 572D in a twin screw extruder, at a temperature of at least 450° F. Flex bars of each blend composition were formed and evaluated for hardness following 10 days of aging at 50% relative humidity and 23° C. The results are reported in TABLE 1. TABLE 1 SURLYN ® FUSABOND ® Shore C Example 8150 (wt %) 572D (wt %) Hardness 1 89 11 91.2 2 84 16 89.8 3 84 16 90.4 4 84 16 89.6 5 81 19 88.9 6 80 20 89.1 7 78 22 88.1 8 76 24 87.6 9 76 24 87.2 10 73 27 86.6 11 71 29 86.7 12 67 33 84.0 When numerical lower limits and numerical upper limits are set forth herein, it is contemplated that any combination of these values may be used. In another example of one embodiment of the invention, the inner core layer has a positive hardness gradient of 10 Shore C or less, more preferably 7 Shore C or less (or, alternatively, about 1 to 2 Shore D). Preferably, the Shore C hardness at the geometric center is 70 to 72 (or, alternatively, about 48-49 Shore D). The Shore C hardness at the surface of the inner core layer is 77 to 79 (or, alternatively, about 50 Shore D). Inner core layers of this nature have about 0.4 phr of an antioxidant such as Vulkanox BKF 75 and about 1 phr of a peroxide, such as Trogonox 265. Typical cure cycles are 350° F. for about 11 minutes. The formulation for the outer core layer preferably contains no antioxidant. The surface hardness of the outer core layer is about 88 to 89 Shore C (or, alternatively, about 60 Shore D), resulting in an overall dual core gradient (from geometric center to surface of the outer core layer) of about 17 to 18 Shore C (or, alternatively, about 11 to 12 Shore D).

In this case, a hardness at the location 1-mm outside of the border of the inner and outer core layers is about 76 to 77 Shore C (or, alternatively, about 53 to 54 Shore D).
