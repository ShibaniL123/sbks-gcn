Latin name of the genus and species: Chamelaucium uncinatum×megalopetalum. Variety denomination: ‘FIRST MAYA’. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The new Chamelaucium cultivar is a product of chance discovery by the inventor, Nitzan Nir, in Kfar Hess, Israel. The new variety was selected as a naturally occurring whole plant mutation of the variety Chamelaucium uncinatum×megalopetalum ‘Early Maya’, unpatented. ‘First Maya’ was selected during October of 2009, at a commercial nursery in Kfar Hess, Israel. Asexual reproduction of the new cultivar has been performed by vegetative cuttings. This was first performed at a commercial nursery in Kfar Hess, Israel in December of 2010 and has shown that the unique features of this cultivar are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The cultivar ‘FIRST MAYA’ has not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment such as temperature, day length, and light intensity, without, however, any variance in genotype. The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘FIRST MAYA’. These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘FIRST MAYA’ as a new and distinct Chamelaucium cultivar: 1. Very early blooming season beginning in September in the Northern Hemisphere.2. Creamy white flower.3. Medium flower size.4. Pink flower bud. PARENT COMPARISON Plants of the new cultivar ‘FIRST MAYA’ are similar to plants of the parent, Chamelaucium uncinatum×megalopetalum ‘Early Maya’ in most horticultural characteristics, however, plants of the new cultivar ‘FIRST MAYA’ produce larger flowers one month earlier than the parent. Additionally, flower buds of ‘FIRST MAYA’ are darker than flower buds of ‘Early Maya’. COMMERCIAL COMPARISON Plants of the new cultivar ‘FIRST MAYA’ are comparable to the variety Chamelaucium hybrid ‘Blondie’, U.S. Plant Pat. No. 9,966. The two Chamelaucium varieties are similar in most horticultural characteristics; however, the new variety ‘FIRST MAYA’ begins flowering earlier than ‘Blondie’. Flower buds of ‘FIRST MAYA’ are Red 50 A compared to bud color of Red-Purple 60A of ‘Blondie’. Additionally, ‘FIRST MAYA’ petals are slightly brighter white, and not occasionally blushed with pink, as characteristic of ‘Blondie’. Plants of the new cultivar ‘FIRST MAYA’ can also be compared to the commercial variety Chamelaucium uncinatum ‘Guy’, unpatented. These varieties are similar in most horticultural characteristics; however ‘FIRST MAYA’ flowers earlier than ‘Guy’. Additionally, petals of the variety ‘Guy’ can change from white to pink, whereas petals of ‘FIRST MAYA’ are consistently white. Flower buds of ‘Guy’ are lighter red than flower buds of ‘FIRST MAYA’. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PHOTOGRAPH The accompanying photograph in FIG. 1 illustrates in full color a close up of typical flowers and foliage of ‘FIRST MAYA’. The age is approximately 1 year. The photograph was taken using conventional techniques and although colors may appear different from actual colors due to light reflectance it is as accurate as possible by conventional photographic techniques.
