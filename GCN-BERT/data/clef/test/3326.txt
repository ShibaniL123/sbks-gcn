Manufacture Example 2: Manufacture of N, N'-diisopropyl-propane-1,2-diimine
197 g (3.33 mol) of isopropylamine and 496 g (4.16 mol) of dehydrated trichloromethane were loaded into a 1 L 4-necked flask and cooled to about 10° C. 150.0 g (0.833 mol) of a 40% pyruvaldehyde aqueous solution was added dropwise to this solution for 1 hour so that a liquid temperature was 10 to 14° C. After the end of the dropping, the mixture was stirred at a liquid temperature of 10° C. for 2 hours. Thereafter, the reaction solution was allowed to stand and the organic layer was separated. Further, the aqueous layer was extracted twice with trichloromethane (100 g), and the organic layer was recovered. All the organic layers were combined, dehydrated with sodium sulfate and filtered, and the solvent was removed at an oil bath temperature of 60 to 70° C. under a slightly reduced pressure. Thereafter, distillation was performed at an oil bath temperature of 64° C. under a reduced pressure. The obtained fraction was a pale yellow transparent liquid. The yield was 95.5 g and the percentage yield was 74.0%.
