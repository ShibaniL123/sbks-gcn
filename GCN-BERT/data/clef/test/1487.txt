This application claims priority to U.S. provisional patent application no. 61/947676 filed Mar. 4, 2014. This and all other extrinsic materials discussed herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The field of the invention is orthosis, including adjustable collars. BACKGROUND The following description includes information that may be useful in understanding the present invention. It is not an admission that any of the information provided herein is prior art or relevant to the presently claimed invention, or that any publication specifically or implicitly referenced is prior art. Cervical collars are often used to maintain a spine in neutral alignment by supporting a user's chin at a particular position. Cervical collars can be supplied for temporary or long-term use, and emergency personnel typically have cervical collars readily available for use on patients having traumatic head or neck injuries. Because potential users of collars are sized and proportioned differently, and storage of bulky collars can be burdensome, many have attempted to provide one-size-fits-most adjustable collars that can be used by different users having different or varying heights, weights and proportions. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,795,315 to Traut teaches a generally flat neck encircling band that can be sized to a standard size prior to being worn, and a mandible support that couples to the band via slots, sliders, locking holes and locking tabs such that the mandible support can be positioned at one of a plurality of vertical positions relative to the band. This and all other extrinsic materials discussed herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. Where a definition or use of a term in an incorporated reference is inconsistent or contrary to the definition of that term provided herein, the definition of that term provided herein applies and the definition of that term in the reference does not apply. Unfortunately, the Traut collar apparently cannot be adjusted when worn, requires separate adjustment and locking members, requires the separate adjustment and locking members to be located at opposing extremeties of the mandible support, and suffers from various other disadvantages. Thus, there is still a need for improved adjustable collars. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The inventive subject matter provides apparatus, systems and methods in which two components of a brace can be coupled to one another in a manner that allows for an adjustment and secured positioning of one component relative to the other via a simple manipulation of a single adjustment piece. In some aspects, a curved chin support is pivotally attached to a curved collar body on right and left sides forming a size-adjustable tracheal opening therebetween. The chin support includes a chin cup and a centrally located single adjustment piece coupled with the chin cup. The adjustment piece includes at least one attachment point and at least two end portions that can couple with notched members of the collar body, the two end portions each including rod-like members. One exemplary adjustment piece has an upside-down U-shape, where the free end portions of the “U” are considered the two free ends of the adjustment piece. The collar body includes left and right notched members, each including a plurality of vertically arranged notches. The left notched member is located on the collar body such that each of its notches are positioned, sized and dimensioned to separately receive the left free end's rod-like member. The right notched member is located on the collar body such that each of its notches are positioned, sized and dimensioned to separately receive the right free end's rod-like member. Preferably, the adjustment piece is biased such that its rod-like members are each seated in a notch of the notched members. In such embodiments, the adjustment piece can simply be moved away from a pair of notches in which its rod-like members are seated, up or down to align with a desired pair of different notches, and released to be seated therein. One or more locking mechanisms could be included, but are not required because the adjustment piece is biased towards an engaged position. It should be appreciated that a rod-like member could have any suitable cross-sectional shape (e.g., circle, oval, square, rectangle, triangle, pentagon, hexaton, diamond or irregular) and does not need to be a circular bar. In other aspects, a rear support could be provided for fastening to the front portion of the brace (chin support and collar body). The rear support could include right and left side fasteners that are complementary to left and right side fasteners located on an outer surface of the front portion of the brace. Preferably the fasteners allow for adjustment of a circumference of the brace to accommodate necks of different sizes (e.g., hook and loop fasteners, snap fasteners). Various objects, features, aspects and advantages of the inventive subject matter will become more apparent from the following detailed description of preferred embodiments, along with the accompanying drawing figures in which like numerals represent like components.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION The following discussion provides many example embodiments of the inventive subject matter. Although each embodiment represents a single combination of inventive elements, the inventive subject matter is considered to include all possible combinations of the disclosed elements. Thus if one embodiment comprises elements A, B, and C, and a second embodiment comprises elements B and D, then the inventive subject matter is also considered to include other remaining combinations of A, B, C, or D, even if not explicitly disclosed. The inventive subject matter provides apparatus, systems and methods in which two components of a brace can be coupled to one another in a manner that allows for an adjustment and secured positioning of one component relative to the other via a simple manipulation of a single adjustment piece. Viewed from another perspective, the braces described herein allow the left and right sides of one component of a brace to be simultaneously adjusted relative to another component via a manipulation of a single centrally-located adjustment piece. As used herein, the term “centrally-located” should be interpreted broadly to include an object whose midline is located at the midline of a second object or anywhere within 15% of the midline in either direction (e.g., up/down or left/right) relative to the entire length of the second object. While the discussion herein is generally directed to cervical collars, one should appreciate that the adjustment mechanisms provided herein could be used with any suitable orthotic device having at least two components that adjustably (e.g., pivotally) couple. An exemplary adjustable collar of the inventive subject matter is shown in FIGS. 1A-1B. FIG. 1A illustrates a front perspective view of brace 100, and FIG. 1B illustrates a left-side perspective views of brace 100. Brace 100 includes a chin support 110 and collar body 120, which are pivotally coupled to one another via fasteners (e.g., 140 and 142) and define a size-adjustable tracheal opening 105 that provides access for airway management and other procedures. As used herein, the term “size-adjustable tracheal opening” refers to an opening of a brace that provides an access point to a wearer's trachea (e.g., for a tracheotomy) when the brace is worn, and is adjustable in size along at least one of a diameter, a length and a width. Chin support 110 includes a chin cup 112 and laterally extending left and right side wings 114 and 116 located on opposite sides of the chin cup 112. The chin cup and laterally extending wings could be made of a single piece of material, or could comprise separate pieces of material that are coupled to one another. Collar body 120 includes a front portion (shown here as being toothed) and left and right side portions 122, 124, respectively. Similarly to the chin support, the front and side portions could be made of a single piece of material, or could comprise separate pieces of material that are coupled with one another. The two components (chin support 110 and collar body 120) are pivotally fastened to one another via a first fastener 140 that couples wing 114 and left side portion 122, and a second fastener 142 that couples wing 116 and right side portion 124. While chin supports and collar bodies of the inventive subject matter are preferably made at least in part of sturdy and stiff materials such as molded thermoplastics (e.g., polyethylene) or thermoset plastics such that each can permanently maintain a generally curved shape that contours to the neck of a wearer, it should be appreciated that the chin support and collar body could each be made of any suitable material or materials. In some preferred braces, the inner surface of the chin support and collar body are coupled with padding material(s) via hook and loop or other fastener(s) such that the inner surfaces of the chin support and collar body are lined partially or entirely with a padding material to prevent or reduce discomfort to a wearer. Brace 100 also includes an adjustment mechanism 130, which is shown in detail in FIGS. 2A-2B. Adjustment mechanism 130 advantageously allows a user (such as a wearer or a medical or emergency professional) to adjust a vertical position of chin support 110 relative to the collar body 120 via a single-handed manipulation of a centrally located adjustment piece. Viewed from another perspective, adjustment mechanism 130 allows a user to adjust a size of a tracheal opening formed by the chin support and collar body via a single-handed manipulation of a centrally located adjustment piece. As illustrated, adjustment mechanism 130 includes a U-shaped adjustment piece 132 that is coupled with chin cup 112. Adjustment piece 132 could be fixedly or movably coupled with the chin cup, for example, via one or more screws, hinges, or other fasteners. While adjustment pieces are generally described herein as being U-shaped, it should be appreciated that adjustment piece could comprise any suitable shape that includes at least one attachment point and at least two end portions that can couple with notched members of the collar body. Where the adjustment piece 132 is fixedly attached to chin piece 112, it is contemplated that the adjustment piece 132 could be movable from an unengaged position to an engaged position via the flexibility of the chin cup 112. For example, the chin cup could be toothed such that the chin cup can more easily be manipulated. Where the adjustment piece 132 is movably attached to chin piece 112 (e.g., pivotally attached via a hinge and spring biasing mechanism), the adjustment piece 132 could be movable from an unengaged position to an engaged position without flexing or deforming of the chin cup 112. U-shaped adjustment piece 132 includes a left end 132A and a right end 132D, each of which comprise a pair of parallel walls, 132B and 132E, respectively, and a member 132C and 132F, respectively, that extend between the parallel walls. Additionally, adjustment mechanism 130 includes a first notched member 134 and a second notched member 136 disposed on right and left sides of the collar body 120, respectively. While members 132C and 132F are shown to be disposed between parallel walls of the U-shaped adjustment piece, it is contemplated that the members could instead be located to project from the left and right ends 132A and 132D, respectively. As used herein, the term “notched member” should be interpreted broadly to include members having two or more recesses, indentations or incisions along an edge, as well as members having one or more openings (through-holes) there-through. Similarly, the term “notch” should be interpreted broadly to include a recess, indentation or incision, as well as an opening. As one non-limiting example, a notched member could comprise a notched rail or slot including a vertical portion that guides a protrusion, projection or rod-like member to a plurality of substantially perpendicular portions (notches) where the protrusion, projection or rod-like member could rest. First notched member 134 includes a plurality of notches including first notch 134A (see FIGS. 3A-3D), second notch 134B, third notch 134C and fourth notch 134D. Second notched member 136 includes a plurality of notches including fifth notch 136A (see FIGS. 3A-3D), sixth notch 136B, seventh notch 137C and eighth notch 136D. Preferably each of the notches of the first and second notched members are horizontally aligned with at least one other notch (e.g., 134A-136A, 134B-136B, 134C-136C, 134D-136D), and sized and dimensioned to separately receive member 132C or 132F. While brace 100 has an adjustment piece 132 that is disposed on the chin support 110 (e.g., coupled with chin piece 112) and notched members 134 and 136 disposed on the collar body 120, it should be appreciated that in some embodiments the adjustment piece could be disposed on the collar body while the notched members could be disposed on sides of the chin support such that the notches vertically align with the adjustment piece's left and right ends. As illustrated in FIGS. 3A-3D, brace 100 can be adjusted to be in one of at least four configurations. It should be appreciated that a brace of the inventive subject matter could include any suitable number of notches (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12) based on a number of different configurations suitable for the brace. For example, where a brace is an adjustable collar and 6 different configurations (lengths between chin cup and collar body) are desired, each of two notched members could comprise 6 notches, totaling 12 notches. In FIG. 3A, brace 100 is in configuration 300A, which provides the greatest vertical distance between chin cup 112 of chin support 110 and a fixed point (e.g., bottommost central point) of collar body 120. In configuration 300A, first notch 134A and fifth notch 136A are horizontally aligned, and left end member 132C and right end member 132F are similarly horizontally aligned. Additionally, left end member 132C is disposed partially or fully within fifth notch 136A and right end member 132F is disposed partially or fully within first notch 134A. As U-shaped adjustment piece 132 is biased in Direction B and notches 134A and 136A can optionally be slanted down and inwards, no locking mechanism is required to keep brace 100 in configuration 300A (or 300B, 300C, 300D), even while brace 100 is being worn. In FIG. 3B, brace 100 is in configuration 300B, which provides for a shorter vertical distance between chin cup 112 and the fixed point of collar body 120 than configuration 300A. In configuration 300B, left end member 132C is disposed partially or fully within sixth notch 136B and right end member 132F is disposed partially or fully within second notch 134B, which is horizontally aligned with sixth notch 136B. Brace 100 could be adjusted from configuration 300A to 300B via a simple manipulation of adjustment piece 132 in Direction A, and release of adjustment piece 132 in Direction B once members 132C and 132F are aligned with notches 136B and 134B. Viewed from another perspective, manipulation of adjustment piece 132 simultaneously moves members 132C and 132F from a first pair of notches (134A and 136A) to a second pair of notches (134B and 136B). In FIG. 3C, brace 100 is in configuration 300C, which provides for a shorter vertical distance between chin cup 112 and the fixed point of collar body 120 than configurations 300A and 300B. In configuration 300C, left end member 132C is disposed partially or fully within sixth notch 136C and right end member 132F is disposed partially or fully within second notch 134C, which is horizontally aligned with sixth notch 136C. In FIG. 3D, brace 100 is in configuration 300D, which provides for a shorter vertical distance between chin cup 112 and the fixed point of collar body 120 than configurations 300A, 300B and 300C. In configuration 300D, left end member 132C is disposed partially or fully within sixth notch 136D and right end member 132F is disposed partially or fully within second notch 134D, which is horizontally aligned with sixth notch 136D.
