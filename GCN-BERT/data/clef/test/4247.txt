[DESCRIPTION] [Invention Title] TITANIUM DIOXIDE NANOPARTICLE, TITANATE, LITHIUM TITANATE NANOPARTICLE, AND PREPARATION METHODS THEREOF [Technical Field] The present invention relates to titanium dioxide nanoparticles, titanate, lithium titanate nanoparticles, and preparation methods thereof. [Background Art] Crystalline titanium dioxide nanoparticles generally having an average particle size of 50 nm or less, which is a representative material for a photocatalyst, have been spotlighted as a new energy environmental material having characteristics such as decomposition of a harmful ingredient, an antibiotic property, deodorization, and the like, using ultraviolet (UV) light as an energy source. Recently, raw materials and usage of the crystalline titanium dioxide nanoparticles as described above have been rapidly developed. A general preparation method of titanium dioxide may be divided as follows. A sulfuric acid method is a method of sintering titanium dioxide obtained by pyrolyzing an aqueous TiOS04 solution at 800 to 1000 °C to grow particles to thereby obtain Ti02 particles having a desired size. In the case of the sulfuric acid method, waste sulfuric acid may be generated during a process, thereby causing an environmental problem, and micro-fine titanium dioxide particles may be prepared by physical grinding, but titanium dioxide particles of which purity is deteriorated due to impurities may be produced. Therefore, the sulfuric acid method may not be used for a raw material for storing energy or a precise material for a multilayer ceramic capacitor (MLCC), or the like. A hydrochloric acid method is a method of reacting heated TiCU vapor with heated oxygen to form ϋΟ2 particles in a high temperature vapor phase. In the case of the hydrochloric acid method, since precipitated particles formed by a high temperature reaction are used, only particles having a rutile crystalline phase are prepared, expensive equipment for collecting hydrochloric acid gas and a chlorine control technology are required, and a risk due to hydrochloric acid gas in the process may be high. Otherwise, there are methods of using alkoxides or high temperature vapor phases such as a sol-gel method, a spray flame method, and a chemical vapor deposition method, but these methods are not significantly useful due to a high process cost and low productivity. The above information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the invention and therefore it may contain information that does not form the prior art that is already known in this country to a person of ordinary skill in the art.

[Mode for Invention] hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail. However, the exemplary embodiments are described for illustrative purposes, and the present invention is not limited thereto. Therefore, the present invention will be defined by the scope of the appended claims to be described below. An exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides titanium dioxide nanoparticles having a quasicrystalline phase, which is an intermediate form between a crystalline phase and an amorphous phase. In the case of using the titanium dioxide nanoparticles having the quasicrystalline phase as in an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, one-dimensional titanate may be prepared. A detailed description thereof will be omitted. A main XRD peak of the quasicrystalline phase may be shifted and broadened as compared to the crystalline phase. More specifically, the quasicrystalline phase may have a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 1.9 to 2.5. More specifically, the main XRD peak of the quasicrystalline phase may be shifted as compared to a main peak of an anatase crystalline phase, such that 2θ may satisfy the following equation: 23°<20<26°. More specifically, the main XRD peak of the quasicrystalline phase may be shifted as compared to a main peak of a rutile crystalline phase, such that 2θ may satisfy the following equation: 26°<20<29°. Characteristics of the peak as described above may be due to a decrease of crystallinity in accordance with an increase of an amount of amorphous phases as compared to a reference crystalline structure (anatase or rutile). The particles may have an average particle size of 150 nm or less. More specifically, the particles may have an average particle size of 10 to 150 nm or 10 to 50 nm. With the preparation method of titanium dioxide nanoparticles according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the particle size may be adjusted as described above. The particle size of the titanium dioxide particle may be adjusted according to desired electrical and/or chemical properties. Another exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides a preparation method of titanium dioxide nanoparticles including: (a) mixing a TiCI4 solution and water to prepareTiOCI2 in a jelly form; and (b) obtaining titanium dioxide nanoparticles having a quasicrystalline phase corresponding to an intermediate form between a crystalline phase and an amorphous phase through a hydrothermal reaction of mixing TiOCI2 having the jelly form with water, wherein in step (a), an amount of water is controlled so that a concentration of Ti3+ ions becomes 0.1 to 1.3 Μ, and in step (b), an amount of water is controlled so that a concentration of Ti3+ ions becomes 1.5 to 4.3 Μ. The hydrothermal reaction in step (b) may be a reaction performed by heating to a temperature to 50 to 200 °C. In step (a), in the case in which the amount of water is controlled so that the concentration of Ti3+ ions becomes 0.1 to 1.3 Μ, TiOCI2 having a jelly form may be prepared. In the case in which the concentration is less than 0.1 Μ, the concentration of Ti3+ ions is insufficient such that a water-soluble solid may not be formed, and in the case in which the concentration is more than 1.3 Μ, a TiOCI2 solid may be formed, such that a water soluble property may not be implemented. The prepared TiOCI2 having the jelly form is stable at room temperature, and Ti ions in the prepared TiOCI2 having the jelly form are trivalent ions. The titanium dioxide nanoparticles having a quasicrystalline phase corresponding to the intermediate form between the crystalline phase and the amorphous phase may be obtained through the hydrothermal reaction of mixing TiOCI2 having the jelly form with water. The hydrothermal reaction mixing TiOCI2 having the jelly form with water may include removing stable chloride ions and hydrochloric acid. Since the TiOCb having the jelly form is stable at room temperature, in the case of reacting TiOCb with a small amount of water, the form of the TiOCb having the jelly form is changed into an aqueous solution phase. At the time of the reaction, Ti3+ ions are precipitated as titanium dioxide particles by reaction with insufficient oxygen. In this case, a meta-stable crystalline phase instead of the crystalline phase is obtained. In addition, at the time of reaction with water, chloride ions float in the aqueous solution except for the precipitates. In this case, a trace amount of hydrochloric acid gas may be generated by floating of the chloride ions. The entire reaction formula is as follows. [Reaction Formula 1] TiCI4 + H20[insufficient] -> TiOCI2liquidsolidjelly + H20[insufficient] -> Ti02[metalstablestate] + HCI[liquid] + HCI[gas] + H20 In this reaction, the concentration of the Ti3+ ion may be 1.5 to 4.3 Μ. In the case in which the concentration is less than 1.5 Μ, the reaction between the Ti3+ ions and oxygen is not conducted such that precipitation is not generated, and in the case in which the concentration is more than 4.3 Μ, the reaction between the Ti3+ ions and oxygen is explosively conducted such that titanium dioxide having a rutile crystalline phase may be formed. In this process, a basic solution for diluting the HCI solution is not added, and the chloride ions and chlorine gas may be removed only by a water reaction. Meanwhile, in this process, a precipitation reaction may be performed while changing a temperature of the aqueous solution at 50 to 200 °C. As a specific example, a rutile phase may be formed at 50 to 90 °C, and an anatase phase may be formed at 90 to 150 °C. In addition, composite particles containing the anatase and rutile phases may be prepared at 150 to 200 °C. The phase change according to the temperature is due to activation energy of the Ti3+ ions. In the prepared titanium dioxide (ϋΟ2) precipitate, the HCI solution, and the floating chloride, the titanium dioxide (ϋΟ2) precipitate may be allowed to remain by filtering, and then the aqueous solution may be removed. Distilled water may be used in order to wash the Ti02 precipitate. Final titanium dioxide nanoparticles may be prepared by filtering the Ti02 precipitate using a filter paper having a pore size of 0.05 pm or less and drying at 60 °C or less. Another exemplary embodiment of the present invention may provide one dimensional titanate prepared by a reaction between titanium dioxide nanoparticles having a quasicrystalline phase corresponding to an intermediate form between a crystalline phase and an amorphous phase with an alkali solution. The one-dimensional titanate may have a nanotube, nanosheet, nanowire, or nanorod shape. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. In the case in which the one-dimensional titanate as described above is used as an energy material (for example, an anode material of a secondary battery), electrical properties may be improved. The one-dimensional titanate may be obtained by reacting the titanium dioxide nanoparticles prepared by the method according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention as described above with a 5 to 25 Μ aqueous alkali solution. In the case in which a concentration of the aqueous alkali solution is less than 5 Μ, it is impossible to break a Ti-O-Ti bond, and in the case in which the concentration is more than 25 Μ, the Ti-O-Ti bond may be completely broken, such that the nanoparticles are in an amorphous state. The aqueous alkali solution may contain at least one of LiOH, ΚΟΗ, and NaOH. Further, the reaction between the titanium dioxide nanoparticles and the aqueous alkali solution may be performed at 80 to 350 °C for 6 to 20 hours. In the case in which a reaction temperature is less than 80 °C, οη℮dimensional nanoparticles may not be prepared due to a decrease in activation energy of layered Ti-O-Ti formed by cleavage of the Ti-O-Ti bond for imparting surface energy, and in the case in which the reaction temperature is more than 350, the one-dimensional property may be lost, and the nanoparticles are changed again into spherical nanoparticles due to excessive activation energy. The titanium dioxide nanoparticles and the aqueous alkali solution may react with each other at a weight ratio of 8:2 to 6:4. The ratio may be effective for preparing one-dimensional titanate. Another exemplary embodiment of the present invention provides lithium titanate nanoparticles prepared by a reaction between the one-dimensional titanate according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention as described above and lithium hydroxide (LiOH). The lithium titanate nanoparticles may be prepared by a preparation method of reacting the titanate according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention as described above with 10 to 30 mol of lithium hydroxide (LiOH) and then heating the reactant to 400 to 1200 °C. In the case of satisfying the above-mentioned range, lithium titanate may be effectively prepared. The lithium titanate may be used as an anode active material of a lithium secondary battery. Hereinafter, examples of the present invention and comparative examples will be described. However, the following examples are only examples of the present invention, and the present invention is not limited thereto. Example 1: Preparation of Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles 500 ml of a TiCI4 solution (97 % or more) was added to 3500 ml of distilled water while slowly reacting with distilled water so that a concentration of Ti3+ ion was 0.9 Μ. In this case, stable Ti ions formed Ti4+ ions, thereby finally forming TiCI4. However, in the case in which water was insufficient for reaction with chloride ions, Ti cations were divided such that Ti3+ ions reacted with water. The reactant formed a water soluble TiOCI2 solid due to a rapid nuclear reaction. After maintaining the reaction, water was added so that the concentration of Ti3+ ions was 3.2 Μ, followed by stirring, thereby preparing an aqueous TiOCb solution. A most ideal molality for preparing the aqueous TiOCh solution was 3.2 Μ, but the aqueous TiOCh solution may be prepared at a concentration of 1.5 to 4.3 Μ. In this case, a precipitation reaction was conducted while changing a stirrer temperature to 50 or 100 °C. After conducting the precipitation reaction for 1 hour, the precipitated ϋΟ2 precipitates were filtered from the precipitates and the aqueous solution using a filter paper having a pore size of 0.05 pm, and then chloride ions and remaining HCI were removed using distilled water. Example 2: Preparation of One-dimensional Titanate One-dimensional titanate was prepared by reacting the titanium dioxide prepared in Example 1 with 10 Μ NaOH at various temperatures and/or for various times. Example 3: Preparation of Lithium Titanate Lithium titanate was prepared by heat treating the one-dimensional titanium dioxide nanotubes prepared in Example 2 and LiOH at 40 to 1200 °C. Example 4: Manufacturing of Coin-type Half Cell An anode slurry was prepared by mixing the lithium titanate prepared in Example 3 as an anode active material, ketjen black as a conducting material, and polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) as a binder with each other at a weight ratio of 90:2:8, and then mixing the mixture with N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (ΝΜΡ) used as a solvent. After the prepared anode slurry was applied onto one surface of a copper current collector and dried at about 130 °C for 2 hours, an anode having a size of 1.4875 cm2 was prepared. A 1 Μ LiPF6 non-aqueous electrolyte was prepared by mixing ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC) with each other at a volume ratio of 1:2, and adding LiPF6 to the non-aqueous electrolyte solvent. A coin-type half cell was manufactured by using lithium metal foil as a cathode, interposing a polyolefin separator between both electrodes, and then injecting the electrolyte. Experimental Example 1: Transmission Electron Microscope Photograph of Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles FIG. 1 shows transmission electron microscope photographs of titanium dioxide nanoparticles according to Example 1. As shown in FIG. 1, it may be appreciated that the titanium dioxide nanoparticles had a particle size of about 10 to 50 nm. Experimental Example 2: XRD Peak Result of Titanium Dioxide FIG. 2 shows an x-ray diffraction (XRD) peak of the titanium dioxide nanoparticles according to Example 1. For comparison with the peak of the titanium dioxide nanoparticles according to Example 1, the XRD results of the titanium dioxide nanoparticles according to Example 1 are shown in FIG. 2 together with XRD results of P-25 (Deggusa Co. Ltd), which is a commercialized powder), powder (Ishihara Corp.) prepared using an existing low temperature uniform precipitation method, and powder obtained by heat-treating the powder (Ishihara Corp.) prepared using the existing low temperature uniform precipitation method. In FIG. 2, the POSCO method indicates a peak of titanium dioxide nanoparticles according to Example 1, P-25 indicates a peak of the P-25 (Deggusa Co. Ltd), which is a commercialized powder, HPPLT powder indicates a peak of the powder (Ishihara Corp.) prepared using the existing low temperature uniform precipitation method, and Heat-treated HPPLT powder indicates a peak of the powder obtained by heat-treating the powder (Ishihara Corp.) prepared using the existing low temperature uniform precipitation method. As shown in FIG. 2, it may be confirmed that in the case of titanium dioxide prepared by the existing method, crystallinity was maintained, but in the case of the nanoparticles according to Example 1, the peak was broadened and a central peak was shifted due to a quasicrystalline phase. In more detail, it may be confirmed that the XRD peak was shifted by formation of the quasicrystalline phase as compared to the power prepared by the existing low temperature uniform precipitation method used as a reference powder having a rutile crystalline phase. In addition, it may be confirmed that the XRD peak was shifted as compared to P-25 (Deggusa Co. Ltd) used as a reference powder having an anatase crystalline phase. The reason of this shift of the XRD peak is that crystallinity disappeared due to an increase in an amount of the amorphous phase as compared to the crystalline structure by formation of the quasicrystalline phase. Experimental Example 3: Scanning Electron Microscope Photograph of One-dimensional Titanate FIG. 3 shows scanning electron microscope photographs of one-dimensional titanate according to Example 2. For comparison with Example 2, scanning electron microscope photographs of titanate prepared by the same method as in Example 2 using Ρ-25 (Deggusa Co. Ltd), which is the commercialized powder, are shown in FIG. 3 together with the photographs according to Example 2. As shown in FIG. 3, it may be confirmed that since the nanoparticles according to Example 2 had the quasicrystalline phase, the nanoparticles were easily dissolved in the alkali solution, such that one-dimensional particles were easily formed, but in the case of using the commercialized powder, a small amount of one-dimensional titanium dioxide and spherical titanium dioxide complicatedly existed instead of one-dimensional titanium dioxide due to a decrease in solubility due to crystallinity. FIG. 4 (a) to (d) are transmission electron microscope photographs of titanate prepared using titanium dioxide particles having various crystalline properties. In FIG. 4, (a) shows titanate (Aldrich Co. Ltd) using rutile titanium dioxide particles, (b) shows titanate according to Example 2 of the present invention, (c) shows titanate using P-25 (Deggusa Co. Ltd) titanium dioxide particles, and (d) shows titanate (Aldrich Co. Ltd) using anatase titanium dioxide particles. As shown in FIG. 4 (a) to (d), it may be confirmed that in the case of using the commercialized powder, a one-dimensional material was not prepared due to a stable crystalline phase, but spherical titanium dioxide and one-dimensional material co-existed. Particularly, it may be confirmed that even in the case of using the anatase particles, the rutile particles, and P-25 having an anatase/rutile composite phase consistently, the spherical titanium dioxide and one-dimensional material were complicatedly formed. However, it may be confirmed that in the case of using titanium dioxide prepared in Example 2, a one-dimensional material having a nanotube shape was uniformly formed. Experimental Example 4: Scanning Electron Microscope Photograph of One-dimensional Titanate According to Reaction Condition FIG. 5 is scanning electron microscope photographs of titanate prepared while changing reaction conditions in Example 2. As shown in FIG. 5, it was confirmed that a one-dimensional shape was freely changed into a nanowire shape, a nanotube shape, a nanosheet shape, or the like according to a change of a thermal synthesis temperature and/or time. Experimental Example 5: Evaluation of Characteristics of Coin-type Half Cell FIG. 6 shows data obtained by evaluating characteristics of a coin-type half cell according to Example 4. In FIG. 6, TNT indicates titanate nanotubes of Example 2, p-TNW indicates commercialized titanate nanowires coated with pitch, p-Ti02 indicates commercialized ϋΟ2 particles coated with pitch, and C-LTO indicates commercialized LTO particles. As shown in FIG. 6, it may be confirmed that characteristics and lifespan of the coin-type half cell according to the examples of the present invention were improved as compared to the existing particles. The reason for this result is that a sufficient space in which lithium may be sufficiently stored was present in an empty space in the one-dimensional nanotubes, which was due to a stable crystalline structure of the titanium dioxide nanotubes. In lithium titanate prepared in examples of the present invention, a space in which lithium may be inserted may be sufficiently secured due to excellent crystallinity, and the stable crystalline phase may enable insertion and separation of lithium in spite of repeated insertion and separation of lithium, as compared to the existing lithium titanate.
