BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Levonorgestrel is a synthetic progestin used alone or in combination with an estrogen in various oral hormonal contraceptives, including emergency and post-coital contraceptives, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Since the introduction of oral contraceptives (OCs), researchers have been directed toward developing new preparations that improve compliance with contraceptive regimens while maintaining efficacy. U.S. Pat. No. 6,667,050 discloses a chewable, palatable oral contraceptive tablet comprising norethindrone, ethinyl estradiol and a chewable carrier. Use of the tablets in a method of female oral contraception is also disclosed. Patent application WO 2007/146805 A discloses a chewable oral dosage form comprising ethinyl estradiol, norethindrone and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. The bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol is improved by enhancing its oral mucosal absorption thus avoiding the first pass metabolism. Potential advantages of chewable tablets are mainly concerning patient acceptance and compliance. In general, chewable tablets are advantageous in that they combine the accuracy of dosage associated with tablets with the optimum bioavailability of suspensions. Chewable dosage forms are designed to be mechanically disintegrated in the mouth to smaller pieces that can be subsequently swallowed. As the disintegration of chewable dosage forms is faster and complete compared to standard formulations that must disintegrate in the gastrointestinal tract, enhanced bioavailability of the active compound present in this type of dosage forms is usually expected. However, in the development of chewable compositions a similar dissolution/disintegration profile to the standard oral non-chewable formulations is required because they might be swallowed by a patient without proper chewing. The dissolution test should be carried out with the intact tablet and not crushing or powdering it to simulate the worst-case scenario where the patient swallows the tablet without chewing it. This is of special relevance in the case of oral contraceptives wherein if the entire dose of contraceptive is not released as a result of a slower disintegration of the dosage form, unintended pregnancy could result. In general, immediate release contraceptives should be rapidly dissolved, meaning that they should release at least 60% of its content in 5 minutes and at least 80% of its content after 10 minutes. The applicant has found that when levonorgestrel is formulated in a chewable tablet as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,667,050, it shows a much lower solubility profile compared with standard non-chewable pharmaceutical tablets and thus, it is not suitable for its administration as a contraceptive. The use of micronized levonorgestrel having a particle size D90 ranging from 5 microns to 15 microns, commonly used in standard levonorgestrel non-chewable oral dosage formulations does not solve this problem. Thus, there is still need of the development of a chewable tablet of levonorgestrel having the advantages of the chewable dosage forms, while assuring the efficacy of the formulation in case of administration without proper chewing. The inventors have surprisingly found that an effective chewable contraceptive formulation comprising levonorgestrel as an active ingredient may be achieved by providing levonorgestrel with a particle size D90 of less than 4 microns. Additionally, it is expected that the chewable formulation according to the present invention also provides a maximum absorption of levonorgestrel, and ethinyl estradiol (if present) through the oral mucosa when the tablet is chewed. The present invention provides a chewable dosage form comprising levonorgestrel and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, wherein levonorgestrel has a particle size D90 of less than about 4 microns, preferably as measured by laser light diffraction and the process of its preparation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One aspect of the invention relates to a chewable tablet comprising levonorgestrel and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient, wherein levonorgestrel has a particle size D90 of less than about 4 microns as preferably measured by laser light diffraction. Other methods of measuring particle size are contemplated by the present invention and are known to those skilled in the art. Also provided is a process for the preparation of chewable tablet of levonorgestrel, the process comprising: a) blending levonorgestrel with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, and b) then forming the tablet by compression of the blend, wherein levonorgestrel has a particle size D90 of less than about 4 microns as preferably measured by laser light diffraction. Also provided is a method of female oral contraception, the method comprising the administration of a chewable tablet comprising a contraceptively acceptable amount of levonorgestrel, wherein levonorgestrel has a particle size D90 of less than about 4 microns as preferably measured by laser light diffraction. The term female herein refers to any female species in need of contraception, e.g., animal, mammal, human, bird, etc. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 depicts the dissolution profile obtained for the chewable tablet of example 1.
