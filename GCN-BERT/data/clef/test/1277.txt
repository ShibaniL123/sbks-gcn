Pro visional Patent Application Serial No, 61/829,918, filed May 31,2013, which is incorporated herein bv reference. FIELD The invention is directed to the area of electrical stimulation systems and leads and methods of making and using the systems and leads. The present invention is also directed to electrical stimulation leads with segmented electrodes having internal lead-retention features, as well as methods of making and using the segmented electrodes, leads, and electrical stimulation systems. BACKGROUND Electrical stimulation can be useful for treating a variety of conditions. Deep brain stimulation can be useful for treating, for example, Parkinson's disease, dystonia, essential tremor, chronic pain, Huntington’s disease, Sevodopa-induced dyskinesias and rigidity, bradykinesia, epilepsy and seizures, eating disorders, and mood disorders. Typically, a lead with a stimulating electrode at or near a tip of the lead provides the stimulation ΐο target neurons in the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (“MRl”) or computerized tomography CTT”) scans can provide a starting point .for determining where the stimulating electrode should be positioned to provide the desired stimulus to the target neurons. After the lead is implanted into a patient’s brain, electrical stimulus current can be delivered through selected electrodes on the lead to stimulate target neurons in the brain. Typically, the electrodes are formed into rings disposed on a distal portion of the lead. The stimulus current projects from the ring electrodes equally in every direction. Because of the ring shape of these electrodes, the stimulus current cannot be directed to one or more specific positions around the ring electrode (℮.ρ:, on one or more sides, or points, around the lead). Consequently, undirected stimulation may result in unwanted stimulation of neighboring neural tissue, potentially resulting In undesired side effects.

In at feast some embodiments, a practitioner may determine the position of the target neurons using recording elecirode(s) and then position the stimulation electrode(s) accordingly. In some embodiments, the same electrodes can be used for both recording and stimulation. In some embodiments, separate leads can be used: one with recording electrodes which identify target neurons, and a second lead with stimulation electrodes that replaces the first after target neuron identification. In some embodiments, the same lead may include both recording electrodes and stimulation electrodes or electrodes may be used for both recording and stimulation. Figure 1 illustrates one embodiment of a device 100 tor brain stimulation. The device includes a lead 110, a plurality of electrodes 125 disposed at least partially about a circumference of die lead 110, a plurality of terminals 135, a connector 130 for connection of the electrodes to a control unit, and a stylet 140 for assisting m insertion and positioning of the lead in the patient's brain. The stylet 140 can be made of a rigid material. Examples of suitable materials for the stylet include, but are not limited to, tungsten, stainless steel, and plastic. The stylet 140 may have a handle 150 to assist insertion into the lead 110, as well as rotation of the stylet 140 and lead 110. The connector 130 fits over a proximal end of the lead 110, preferably after removal of the stylet 140. The control unit (not shown) is typically an implantable pulse generator that can be implanted into a patient's b‘)dy, for example, below the patient’s clavicle area. The pulse generator can have eight stimulation channels which may be independently programmable to control the magnitude of the current stimulus from each channel. In some cases the pulse generator may have more or lower than eight stimulation channels (e.g,, 4-, 6-, 16". 32--., or more stimulation channels). The control unit may have one, two, three., lour, or more connector ports, for receiving the plurality of terminals 135 at the proximal end of the lead 110. In one example of operation, access to the desired position in the brain can he accomplished by drilling a hole in the patient's skull or cranium with a cranial drill (commonly referred to as a burr), and coagulating and incising the dura mater, or brain covering. The lead 110 can be inserted into the cranium and brain tissue with the assistance of the stylet 140. The lead 110 can be guided to the target location within the brain using, for example, a stereotactic frame and a microdrive motor system. In some embodiments, the microdrive motor system can be fully or partially automatic. The microdrive motor system may be configured to perform one or more the following actions (alone or in combination): insert the lead 110. retract the lead 110, or rotate the lead 110, in some embodiments, measurement devices coupled to the muscles or other tissues stimulated by the target neurons, or a unit responsive to the patient or clinician, can be coupled to the control unit or microdrive motor system. The measurement device, user, or clinician can indicate a response by the target muscles or other tissues to the stimulation or recording electrode(s) to further identify the target neurons and facilitate positioning of the stimulation eleetrode(s). For example, if the target neurons are directed to a muscle experiencing tremors, a measurement device can be used to observe the muscle and indicate changes in tremor frequency or amplitude in response to stimulation of neurons. Alternatively, the patient or clinician may observe the muscle and provide feedback. The lead 110 for deep brain stimulation can include stimulation electrodes, recording electrodes, or both, in at least some embodiments, the lead 110 is rotatable so that the stimulation electrodes can be aligned with the target neurons after the neurons have been located using the recording electrodes. Stimulation electrodes may be disposed on the circumference of the lead 110 to stimulate the target neurons. Stimulation electrodes may be ring-shaped so that current projects from each electrode equally in every direction from the position of the electrode along a length of the lead 110. Ring electrodes, however, typically do not enable stimulus current to be directed to only one side of the lead. Segmented electrodes, however, can be used to direct stimulus current to one side, or even a portion of one aisle, of the lead. When segmented electrodes are used in conjunction with an implantable pulse generator that delivers constant current stimulus, current steering can be achieved to more precisely deliver the stimulus to a position around an axis of the lead (/.<?., radial positioning around the axis of the lead). To achieve current steering, segmented electrodes can be utilized in addition to, or as an alternative to, ring electrodes. Though the following description discusses stimulation electrodes, it will be understood that all configurations of the stimulation electrodes discussed may be utilized in arranging recording electrodes as well. Figure 2 illustrates one embodiment of a distal portion of a lead 200 for brain stimulation. The lead 200 includes a lead body 210, one or more optional ring electrodes 220, and a plurality of sets of segmented electrodes 230. The lead body 210 can he formed of a biocompatible, non-conducting material such as, for example, a polymeric material, Suitable polymeric materials include, but are not limited to, silicone, polyurethane, polyethylene, polyurea, polyurethane-urea, or lhe like. Once implanted in the body, the lead 200 may be in contact with, body tissue for extended periods of time. In at least some embodiments, the lead 200 has a cross-sectional diameter of no more than 1.5 mm and may be in the range of ,5 to 1.5 mm. In at least some embodiments, the lead 200 has a length of at least 10 cm and the length of the lead 200 may be in the range of 10 to 70 cm. The electrodes may be made using a metal, alloy, conductive oxide, or any other suitable conductive biocompatible material. Examples of suitable materials include, but are not limited to, platinum, platinum iridium alloy, iridium, titanium, tungsten, palladium, or the like. Preferably, the electrodes are made of a material that is biocompatible and does not substantially corrode under expected operating conditions in the operating environment for the expected duration of use. Each of the electrodes can either be used or unused (OFF). When tire electrode is used, the electrode can be used as an anode or cathode and carry anodic or cathodic current, hi some instances, an electrode might be an anode for a period of time and a cathode for a period of time. Stimulation electrodes in the form of ring electrodes 220 may be disposed on any part of the lead body 210, usually near a distal end of the lead 200. In Figure 2, the lead 200 includes two ring electrodes; 220. Any number of ring electrodes 220 may be disposed along the length of the lead body 210 including, tor example, one, two three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen or more ring electrodes 220. It will be understood that any number of ring electrodes may be disposed along the length of the lead body 210. in some embodiments, the ring electrodes 220 are substantially cylindrical and wrap around die entire circumference of the lead body 210. In some embodiments, the outer diameters of the ring electrodes 220 are substantially equal to the outer diameter of the lead body 210. The length of the ring electrodes 220 may vary according to the desired treatment and the location of the target neurons. In some embodiments, the length of the ring electrodes 220 are less than, or equal to, the diameters of the ring electrodes 220. In other embodiments, the lengths of the ring electrodes 220 are greater than the diameters of the ring electrodes 220. In other embodiments, the lengths of the ring electrodes 220 are greater than the diameters of the ring electrodes 220. The distal-most ring electrode 220 may be a tip electrode (me wes, tip electrode 320a of Figure 3C) which covers most, or all. of the distal tip of the lead. Deep brain stimulation leads may include one or more sets of segmented electrodes. Segmented electrodes may provide for superior current steering than ring electrodes because target structures in deep brain stimulation are not typically symmetric about the axis of the distal electrode array. Instead, a target may be located on one side of a plane running through the axis of the lead. Through the use of a radially segmented electrode array feRSEA'!), current steering can be performed not only along a length of the lead but also around a circumference of the lead. This provides precise three-dimensional targeting and delivery of the current stimulus to neural target tissue, while potentially avoiding stimulation of other tissue. Examples of leads with segmented electrodes include ITS. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2010/0268298: 2011/0005069: 2011/0130803; 2011/0130816: 2011/0130817; 2011/0130818; 2011/0078900; 2011/0238129; 2012/0016378, 2012/0046710; 2012/0071949; 2012/0165911; 2012/19 7375; 2012/0203316; 2012/0203320; and 2012/0203321, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. In Figure 2, the lead 200 is shown having a plurality of segmented electrodes 230. Any number of segmented electrodes 230 may be disposed on the lead body 210 including, for example, one, two three, lour, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen or more segmented electrodes 230. it will be understood that any number of segmented electrodes 230 may be disposed along the length of the lead body 210. A segmented electrode 130 typically extends only 75%, 67%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 33%, 25%, 20%, 17%, 15%, or less around the circumference of the lead. The segmented electrodes 230 may be grouped into sets of segmented electrodes, where each set is disposed around a circumference of the lead 200 at a particular longitudinal portion of the lead 200. The lead 200 may have any number segmented electrodes 230 in a given set of segmented electrodes. The lead 200 may have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, or more segmented electrodes 230 in a given set. fit at least some embodiments, each set of segmented electrodes 230 of the lead 200 contains the same number of segmented electrodes 230. The segmented electrodes 230 disposed on the lead 200 may include a different number of electrodes than at least one other set of segmented electrodes 23ϋ disposed on the lead 200. The segmented electrodes 230 may vary in size and shape. In some embodiments, the segmented electrodes 230 are all of the same size, shape, diameter, width or area or any combination thereof In some embodiments, the segmented electrodes 230 of each circumferential set for even all segmented electrodes disposed on the lead 200) may be identical in size and shape. Each set of segmented electrodes 230 may be disposed around the circumference of the lead body 210 to form a substantially cylindrical shape around the lead body 210, The spacing between individual electrodes of a given set of the segmented electrodes may be the same, or different from, the spacing between individual electrodes of another set of segmented electrodes on the lead 200. In at least some embodiments, equal spaces, gaps, or cutouts are disposed between each segmented electrode 230 around the circumference of the lead body 210. In other embodiments, the spaces, gaps, or cutouts between die segmented electrodes 230 may differ In size or shape. In other embodiments, the spaces, gaps, or cutouts between segmented electrodes 230 may he uniform for a particular set of the segmented electrodes 230, or for oil sets of the segmented electrodes 230, The sets of segmented electrodes 230 may be positioned in irregular or regular intervals along a length the lead body 210, Conductor wires that attach to the ring electrodes 220 or segmented electrodes 230 extend along the lead body 210. These conductors may extend through the material of the lead 200 or along one or more lumens defined by the lead 200, or both. The conductors are presented at a connector (via terminals; tor coupling of the electrodes 220, 230 to a control unit (not shown). When the lead 200 includes both ring electrodes 220 and segmented electrodes 230, the ring electrodes 220 and the segmented electrodes 230 may be arranged in any suitable configuration. For example, when the lead 200 includes two sets of ring electrodes 220 and two sets of segmented electrodes 230. the ring electrodes 220 can flank the two sets of segmented electrodes 230 (see e.g.t Figure 2). Other alternate electrode configurations may be used. Figures 3 A-3C illustrate leads 300 with segmented electrodes 330. optional ring electrodes 320 or tip electrodes 320a, and a lead body 310, T he sets of segmented electrodes 330 include three segmented electrodes or any other number of segmented electrodes including, for example, two, four, five, six, or more. In each of Figures 3A-3C2 two sets of segmented electrodes 330 and two sets of optional ring electrodes 320 are shown. Any suitable number of segmented electrodes 330, or ring electrodes 320, or both, may be used. The two sets of ring electrodes 220 can be disposed proximal to the two sets of segmented electrodes 230 (see e.g. Figure 3 A), or the two sets of ring electrodes 220 can be disposed distal to the two sets of segmented electrodes 230 (see ο..ν . Figure 3Β). One of the ring electrodes can be a tip electrode (see, tip electrode 320a of Figure 3C). It will be understood that, other configurations are possible as well (e.g, alternating ring and segmented electrodes, or the like). Any other suitable arrangements of segmented electrodes can be used. As an example, arrangements in which segmented electrodes are arranged helically wills respect to each other. One embodiment includes a double helix. By varying the location of the segmented electrodes 230, different coverage of the target neurons may be selected. For example, the electrode arrangement of Figure 3Λ may be useful if the physician anticipates that the neural target will be closer to a distal tip of the lead body 210. while the electrode arrangement of Figure 3Β may be useful if the physician anticipates that the neural target will be closer to a proximal end of the lead body 210. Any combination of ring electrodes 220 and segmented electrodes 230 may be disposed on the lead 200, Fur example, the lead may include a first ring electrode 120. two sets of segmented electrodes, where each set is formed of three segmented electrodes 230, and a final ring electrode 120 at the distal end portion (or, in the case of a tip electrode, at the distal lip of the lead). This configuration may simply be referred to as a ! «3-3-1 configuration. It may be useful io refer to the electrodes with this shorthand notation. Thus, the embodiment of Figure 3 A may be referred to as a 1-1-3-3 configuration, while the embodiment of Figure 3Β may be referred to as a 3-3-1-1 configuration. Other eight-electrode configurations include, for example, a 2-2-2-2 configuration, where four sets of segmented electrodes are disposed on the lead, and a 4-4 configuration, where two sets of segmented electrodes, each having lour segmented electrodes 23ϋ are disposed on the lead. In some embodiments, the lead includes 16 electrodes. Possible configurations tor a 16-electrode lead include, but are not limited to 4-4-4-4; 8-8: .· ··Αο·.-·1 (and all rearrangements of this configuration): and 2-2-2-2-2-2-2-2. Figure 4 is a schematic diagram to illustrate radial current steering along various electrode levels along a longitudinal length of the lead 200. While conventional lead configurations with ring electrodes are only able to steer current along the longitudinal length of the lead (the z-axis). the segmented electrode configuration is capable of steering current I a the x-axis, y-axis as well as the 2-axis. Thus, the centroid of stimulation may be steered in any direction in the three-dimensional space surrounding the lead 200. In some embodiments, the radial distance, r, and the angle θ around the circumference of the lead 200 may be dictated by the percentage of anodic current (recognizing that stimulation predominantly occurs near the cathode, although strong anodes may cause stimulation as well! introduced to each electrode. In at least some embodiments, the configuration of anodes and cathodes along the segmented elec trodes allows the centroid of stimulation to be shitted to a variety oi different locations along the lead 200. As can be appreciated from Figure 4, the centroid of stimulation can be shifted at each level along the longitudinal length of the lead 200. The use of multiple sets of segmented electrodes at different levels along the longitudinal length of the lead allows tor three-dimensional current steering. In some embodiments, the sets of segmented electrodes are shifted collectively (ό℮., the centroid of simulation is similar at each level along the length of the lead). In at least some other embodiments, each set of segmented electrodes is controlled independently. Each set of segmented electrodes may contain two, three, four, live, six, seven, eight or more segmented electrodes. It will be understood that different stimulation profiles may be produced by varying the number of segmented electrodes at each level. For example, when each set of segmented electrodes includes only two segmented electrodes, uniformly distributed gaps (inability to stimulate selectively) may be formed in the stimulation profile. In some embodiments, at least three segmented electrodes 230 in a set are utilized to allow for true 360° selectivity. As previously indicated, the foregoing configurations may also be used while utilizing recording electrodes, In some embodiments, measurement devices coupled to the muscles or other tissues stimulated by the target neurons or a unit responsive to the patient or clinician can be coupled to the control unit or microdrive motor system. The merisurement device, user, or clinician can indicate a response by the target muscles or other tissues to the stimulation or recording electrodes to further identity the target neurons and facilitate positioning of the stimulation electrodes. For example, if the target neurons are directed to a muscle experiencing tremors, a measurement device can be used to observe the muscle and indicate changes in tremor frequency or amplitude in response to stimulation of neurons. Alternatively, the patient or clinician may observe the muscle and provide feedback, The reliability and durability of the lead will depend heavily on the design and method of manufacture. Fabrication techniques discussed below provide methods that can produce manufacturable and reliable leads. When the lead 200 includes a plurality of sets of segmented electrodes 230, it may be desirable to form the lead 200 such that corresponding electrodes of different sets of segmented electrodes 230 are radially aligned with one another along the length of the lead 200 (see eg., the segmented electrodes 230 shown in Figure 2). Radial alignment between corresponding electrodes of different' sets of segmented electrodes 230 along the length of the lead 200 may reduce uncertainty as to the location or orientation between corresponding segmented electrodes of different sets of segmented electrodes. Accordingly, it may be beneficial to form electrode arrays such that corresponding electrodes of different sets of segmented electrodes along the length of the lead 200 are radially aligned with one another and do not radially shift in relation to one another during manufacturing of the lead 200, Figure 5 is a side view of another embodiment of the lead 200 having a plurality of sets of segmented electrodes. As shown in Figure 5, individual electrodes in the two sets of segmented electrodes 230 are staggered relative to one another along the length of the lead body 210. In some cases, the staggered positioning of corresponding electrodes of different sets of segmented electrodes along the length of the lead 2ϋ0 may be designed for a specific application. A number of issues can arise in the manufacture of leads containing segmented electrodes. For example, it may be difficult to maintain the position and spacing between segmented electrodes during or after manufacture, particularly during operations in which parts of the lead body are heated for reflow. The segmented electrodes may shift within the heated polymer, altering the spacing between segmented electrodes. Furthermore, electrode retention after manufacture may he of concern. Segmented electrodes and methods of manufacture can be designed to address these and other issues, for example, U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/356,529, incorporated herein by reference, provides some examples of segmented electrodes and method of manufacture. As herein described, the segmented electrodes can include one or more lead-retention features That facilitate retention and maintenance of the positioning and spacing of the segmented electrodes during or after (or both during and after) manufacture. During manufacture, the lead-retention features can be at least partially filled (preferably, completely filled) with material from the lead body or other portions of the lead to facilitate maintenance of the positioning and spacing, as well as retention, of the segmented electrodes. Bets of radially-disposed segmented electrodes can be formed from pre-electrodes. Figures 6A-10C illustrate embodiments of pre-electrodes and sets of segmented electrodes formed from the pre-electrodes (e,g.,, by grinding down the pre-electrodes to form electrically isolated segmented electrodes). The pre-electrodes, and segmented electrodes formed therefrom, may be formed of an electrical conductor such as a metal, alloy, conductive oxide, or any other suitable conductive material. In some embodiments, the pre-electrodes are formed of platinum, platinum-iridium, iridium, 616L stainless s teel (or any other suitable stainless steel), tantalum, Nitinof iridium rhodium, or a conductive polymer. in some embodiments, the pre-electrodes are substantialiy-cylindrieal and have a diameter larger than the desired final diameter of a lead. A lead with a cylindrical cross-sectional profile may be obtained by grinding (e.g., center-less grinding), machining, etching, or ablating outer sur laces of the pre-electrodes. The grinding can also release the individual segmented electrodes. In Figures 6A-10C three segmented electrodes are shown formed from each pre-electrode. It will be recognized that other embodiments of pre-electrodes can have two, four, five, six, seven, eight, or more segmented electrodes. Figures 6A-6C illustrate embodiments of a pre-electrode 600. Figures 6Α and 6C show transverse cross-sectional views of the pre-electrode, and Figure 6Β shows a perspective view of the pre-electrode. The pre-electrode 600 includes a body 602 having an interior surface 604 and an outer surface (for, a transverse circumference) 606. As shown in Figure 6Β, the pre-electrode 600 also includes a proximal end 608 and a distal end 610. In some embodiments, the body 604 of the pre-electrode 600 is substantialiy-cylindrieal and has a diameter larger than the desired final diameter of a lead upon which the pre-electrode 600 Is disposed. The proximal and distal ends of the pre-electrodes correspond to the orientation of the pre-electrode when disposed on a lead. For example, when the pre-electrode is disposed on a lead, the proximal end of the pre-electrode is closest t o the proximal end portion of the lead. In which case, when the pre-electrode is disposed on a lead, the transverse cross-sectional view of the pre-electrode would also be transverse to a longitudinal length of the lead. It wall be understood that, this orientation of the pre-electrodes, as well as the orientation of the pre-electrodes when disposed on leads, applies to each of the pre-electrodes discussed herein. The pre-electrode 600 includes individual segmented electrodes 612 joined by connecting material 614. The connecting material 614 can be removed (for example, by grinding, machining, etching, ablating, or otherwise removing the connecting material 614) to leave the separated segmented electrodes 612 when the pre-electrode is in place on the lead. The pre-electrode 600 defines cutouts 616 between the individual segmented electrodes, which typically define the spacing between the segmented electrodes of a particular set of segmented electrodes. The connecting material 614 may correspond only to the materia] between the segmented electrodes 612 or may include other portions of the pre-electrode 600 (e.g, an outer ring, or rim, of material that can be ground away to release the underlying segmented electrodes). The cutouts can function as lead-retention features by allowing material, such as material from the lead body (including spacers positioned, for example, between sets of segmented electrodes or between a set of segmented electrodes and a ring electrode) or other material, to be placed, or flowed,, into the cutouts. The material within the cutouts can also facilitate maintenance of the positioning and spacing of the segmented electrode. The cutouts 616 have perimeters 617 extending between adjacent portions of the interior surface 604 of the pre-electrode 600, The perimeter 617 can be continuous or discontinuous. In some embodiments, the perimeter 617 of at least one of the cutouts forms a continuous surface extending between two portions of the interior surface 604 of the pre-electrode (we e.g, Figure 6Λ), In other embodiments, the perimeter 617 of at least one of the cutouts forms a discontinuous surface, where the perimeter is discontinuous due to an alignment slit 640 (see e.g, Figure 6C) along a lateral (erg,, toward the outer edge) portion of the cutout. Similarly, the pre-electrodes 700, 800. 900, and 1000 are each shown and described as having perimeters that can be either continuous or discontinuous. Each cutout abuts two segmented electrodes with portions of the perimeter 617 forming side-walls of those segmented electrodes, In at least some embodiments, the perimeter of at least one of the cutouts is shaped such that one or more open cavities (e,g. nooks, notches, voids, indentations, open spaces, or the like or combinations thereof) are formed a long a t least a portion of the side-wall of at least one of the segmented electrodes abutting that cutout. The one or more open cavities may enhance lead retention by facilitating adhesion of the material of the lead body to the pre-electrode (prior to removal of the connecting material);, and to the segmented electrodes (alter removal of the connecting material). In at least some embodiments, the open cavities are configured to receive and partially retain a portion of one or more conductors (see c.g., Figures 7A-7C). In at least some embodiments, the one or more of the open cavities provide one or more electrical coupling interfaces for coupling one or more portions of one or more conductors to a particular' segmented electrode (see c g . Figure 7C). Figures 6A-6C illustrate cutouts that are clover-shaped in transverse cross-section with multi-dobed perimeters 617 that define a lateral lobe 618 and one or more side lobes 620. The side lobes 620 are configured to form opposing cavities (620 in Figures 6D-6E) defined along side-walls (622a and 622b in Figures 6D -6E) of abutting segmented electrodes 612. The lateral lobe 618 is positioned along a lateral periphery of the cutout 616 such that, when the connecting material 614 is removed, the lateral lobe 618 opens to the outer surface 606 of the pre-electrode. In at least some embodiments, the lateral lobe 618 extends at least partially into the connecting material 614 such that, when the connecting material 614 is removed the lateral lobe 618 is at least partially removed along with the connecting material 614, In at least some embodiments, when the connecting material 614 is removed the one or more side lobes 620 remain intact, The pre-electrode 600 further includes one or more channels 628 formed in the segmented electrodes 612. There may be one, two. three, four, or more channels formed in each of the segmented electrodes. The number of channels in each segmented electrode may be the same or different from the number of channels in other segmented electrodes. The one or more channels can function as lead-retention features by allowing material, such as material from the lead body (including spacers positioned, for example, between sets of segmented electrodes or between a set of segmented electrodes and a ring deed ode) or other material, to be placed, or flowed, into the channels. The material within the channels can also facilitate maintenance of the positioning and spacing of the segmented electrode. In at least some embodiments, the one or more channels are defined along the interior surface 604 of the body 602. in Figure 6Α. die one or more channels 628 have arcuate transverse cross-sectional shapes that open to the interior surface 604 of the body 602 with a portion of a perimeter of the channel surrounded by the segmented electrode. In at least some embodiments, the one or more channels 628 have a cross-sectional shape that is open to the interior surface 604 of the body 602 with at least half of the perimeter of the channel surrounded by the segmented electrode. It will be recognized that oilier embodiments, similar to those illustrated in Figures 6A-10C, could include channels with other regular or irregular cross-sectional shapes including, but not limited to, oval, triangular, square, rectangular, pentagonal, hexagonal octagonal “T’-shaped, “I/'-shaped, and other cross-sectional shapes. It will be recognized that the transverse cross-sectional shape of the channel need not be uniform along the length of the channel. It will be further recognized that the channels need not be identical and that different segmented electrodes may have differently shaped channels or that channels in a particular segmented electrode may be differently shaped. In some embodiments, the channels do not extend fully through the segmented electrode along a radial direction, but only extend partially (e.g., one half or one third of the radial distance) through the segmented electrode, In some instances, the outer surface of the pre-electrode may be uniform. In which case, the positioning of the segmented electrodes beneath may not be apparent when viewing the pre-electrode from the side (i. e,, through the outer surface from a position exterior to the pre-electrode). It may be advantageous to be able to determine the alignment of the segmented electrodes along the pre-electrode in order to position the segmented electrodes along the lead in a desired configuration. Alignment of the segmented electrodes may be particularly relevant when aligning multiple pre-electrodes with one another along a longitudinal length of the lead, hi winch case, it may be desirable to form the lead such that corresponding electrodes of different sets of segmented electrodes are rotationally aligned (see e,g.„ the segmented electrodes 230 shown in Figure 2), or rotationally staggered (see e.g.,. the segmented electrodes 230 shown in Figures 3Α-3Β) with respect to one another along the longitudinal length of the lead. Rotational alignment (or rotational staggering) between corresponding electrodes of different sets of segmented electrodes along the longitudinal length of the lead may reduce uncertainty as to the location or orientation between corresponding segmented electrodes of different sets of segmented electrodes. Accordingly, it may be beneficial to form electrode arrays such that corresponding electrodes of different sets of segmented electrodes along the longitudinal length of the lead are rotational!}' aligned (or rotationally staggered) with one another during manufacturing of the lead. In at least some embodiments, the pre-electrode includes one or more alignment features for enabling the rotational positioning of the segmented electrodes of the pre-electrode to be apparent when viewing the pre electrode from the side. In at least some embodiments, the alignment feature forms an opening extending between the outer surface of the pre-electrode and one of the cutouts. In at least some embodiments, the alignment feature includes one or more alignment apertures, In Figure 6Β, the pre-electrode 600 is shown defining one or more alignment apertures 630 extending between the outer surface 606 of the body 602 and one of the cutouts 616, The one or more alignment apertures do not extend an entire distance between the proximal end and the distal end of the pre-electrode. In Figure 6Β, the alignment aperture 630 is shown extending into the main lobe 618 of the cutout 616. In at least some embodiments, the one or more alignment apertures are positioned such that removal of the connecting material causes a corresponding removal of the one or more alignment apertures without affecting she shape of any of the formed segmented electrodes. In at least some embodiments, the alignment feature includes one or more alignment slits. Figure 6C sho ws one embodiment of the pre-electrode 600 defining an alignment slit 640. The alignment slit 640 is disposed along one of the cutouts 6)6 and extends along fhe entire length of the cutout 616 between the proximal end 608 and the distal end 610 of the body 602, effectively making the body 602 of the pre-electrode 600 open-loop, or C-shaped (/.<?., the transverse cross-sectional circumference, or outer surface 606, of the pre-electrode is discontinuous). in at least some embodiments, the alignment slit 640 is entirely disposed along one of the cutouts 616, In which case, when the connecting material 614 of the pre-electrode 600 is removed the alignment slit 640 is entirely disposed within the spacing between two segmented electrodes of the set of segmented electrodes formed along the pre-electrode 600- Additionally, when the alignment slit 640 is entirely disposed along one of the cutouts 616 remo val of the connecting material 614 causes a corresponding removal of the alignment slit 640 without affecting the shape of any of the formed segmented electrodes, As mentioned above, conductors typically extend along a longitudinal length of the lead upon which the pre-electrode is disposed. The conductors electrically couple electrodes >c ;.w segmented electrodes, ring electrodes, tip electrodes, and the like) disposed along a distal end portion of the lead to terminals disposed along a proximal end portion of the lead. Depending on the relative positioning of a given pre-electrode along the lead, one or more conductors may extend through the pre-electrode and couple to other electrodes (e.#., electrodes of other pre-electrodes, ring electrodes, tip electrodes, or the like or combinations thereof), in which case, it may be advantageous to form the pre-electrode with an alignment slit so that, during manufacturing, one or more of the conductors can be passed through the alignment slit without needing to string the ends of the one or more conductors through the pre-electrode to reach other electrodes. Figure 61) illustrates, in transverse cross section, the set of segmented electrodes 612 formed after removal of the connecting material 614 of the pre-electrode 600, The segmented electrodes 612 include the interior surface 604, an opposing exterior surface 656, and opposing side-walls 622a and 622b each extending radially between the interior surface 604 and the exterior surface 656. it will be understood that, although not shown in Figure 6D, the segmented electrodes 612 also include a proximal end and an opposing distal end. These proximal and distal ends are typically the same as the proximal and distal ends of the pre-electrode. For example, in at leas t some embodiments the proximal and distal ends of the segmented electrodes 612 are the same as the proximal and distal ends of the pre-electrode 600 shown i n Figure 6Β. In at least some embodiments, each of the interior surface 604, the exterior surface 656. and the side-walls 622a and 622b extend from the proximal end to the distal end of the pre-electrode. The interior surfaces 6()4 of the segmented electrodes 612 are typically defined by the Interior surface 604 of the pre-electrode 600, The opposing side-walls 622a and 622b are typically defined by portions of the perimeters 617 of the cutouts 616. In at least some embodiments, when removing the connecting material 614. portions of the perimeter 617 of the cuto uts 616 (particularly the lateral-most portions of the perimeter 617) may be removed along with the connecting material 614. T he exterior surfaces 656 of the segmented electrodes 612 are formed from inner portions of the body 602 of the pre-electrode 600 that previously abutted the connecting material 614 prior to removal of the connecting material 614. At least one open cavity is defined along at least one of the side-walls of at least one of the segmented electrodes. In at least some embodiments, two, three, four, or more open cavities are defined along at least one of the side-walls of at least one of the segmented electrodes. In Figure 6D, open cavities are defined by the side lobes 620 of the multi-Iobed cutouts. In Figure 6D, these open cavities are defined along both side-walls 622a and 622b of each of the segmented electrodes 612. in at least some embodiments, open cavities extend along the entire dimension of the segmented electrode from the proximal end to the distal end. Open cavities do not extend an entire circumferential length of a segmented electrode between opposing side-walls. Additionally, when open cavities extend circumferentially inwardly along opposing side-walls, the open ca vities of the opposing side-walls do not open to one another. It will be understood that the above description of open cavities applies to all of the open cavities described herein. It may be advantageous for the open cavities to not extend an entire circumferential length of a segmented electrode between opposing side-walls. Extending the open ca vities an entire circumferential length of a segmented electrode between opposing side-walls may reduce the integrity of the segmented electrodes to a potentially unsafe level. Additionally, in embodiments where the open cavities extend along the entire dimension of the segmented electrode from the proximal end to the distal end, were the open cavities to also extend the entire circumferential length of a segmented electrode between opposing side-walls then the segmented electrodes would be undesirably split into two discrete pieces. Moreover, extending the open cavities an entire circumferential length of a segmented electrode between opposing side-wails may make it difficult to remove air pockets when flowing or molding lead material or spaces around the segmented electrodes. Figure 6Β illustrates, in transverse cross section, the set of segmented electrodes 612, as shown in Figure 6D. disposed along a lead body 672. In Figure 6Ε, the lead body 672 includes a longitudinal surface 676, Optionally, the lead body 672 defines one or more lumens 680 extending a long a longitudinal length of the lead body 672 and configured ΐο receive a stylet (sec ℮.σ., 140 in Figure 1). In at least some embodiments, the segmented electrodes 612 are equally spaced-apart from one another around a transverse circumference of the lead body 672, The exterior surfaces 656 of one or more of the segmented electrodes 612 can be inset from, or extended outwardly from, the longitudinal surface 676 of the lead body 672. In Figure 6Ε. the exterior surfaces 656 of each of the segmented electrodes 612 are shown flush with the longitudinal surface 676 of the lead body 672. i t may be advantageous for the exterior surfaces 656 of each of the segmented electrodes 612 to be flush with the longitudinal surface 676 of the lead body 672 in order to maintain an isodiametrie profile along a distal end portion of the lead body, thereby reducing the risk of patient tissue getting caught along the lead body during lead insertion. f uming to Figures 7A-7C, in at least some embodiments the open cavities of the segmented electrodes are configured to receive and partially retain at least a portion of one or more conductors extending along the lead (e.g,, conductors electrically coupling the electrodes to the terminals). In at least sonic embodiments, the open cavities also provide electrical coupling interfaces for electrically coupling one or more conductors to the segmented eiectrodes. Figures 7Α-7Β illustrate schematic transverse cross-sectional views of alternate embodiments of a pre-electrode 700, The pre-electrode 700 includes a body 702 that has an interior surface 704, an outer surface 706, and that defines cutouts 716. The pre-electrode 700 includes individual segmented electrodes 712 joined by connecting material 714 that can be removed (for example, by grinding, machining, etching, ablating, laser cutting, or otherwise removing the connecting material 714) to leave the separated segmented electrodes 712 when the pre-electrode is in place on die lead. In Figure 7Α, the body 702 of the pre-electrode 7ϋ0 has a closed-loop transverse circumference. In Figure 7Β, the body 702 defines an alignment slit 740. The alignment slit 740 is disposed along one of the cutouts 716 and extends along the entire length of the cutout 716 between a proximal end and a distal end of the body 702, effecti vely making the body 702 of the pre-electrode 700 open-loop, or C-shaped (/,℮, the cross-sectional circumference, or outer surface 706, of the pre-electrode is discontinuous). In at least some embodiments, the alignment slit 740 is entirely disposed along one of the cutouts 716. In which case, when the connecting material 714 of the pre-electrode 700 is removed the alignment slit 740 may be at least partially disposed within the spacing between two segmented electrodes of the set of segmented electrodes formed along the pre-electrode 700. In at least some embodiments, when the connecting material 714 of the pre-electrode 700 is removed the alignment slit 740 is entirely disposed within the spacing between two segmented electrodes of the set of segmented electrodes formed along the pre-electrode 700. In at least some embodiments, the alignment slit 740 is positioned such that removal of the connecting material 714 causes a corresponding removal of the alignment slit 740 without affecting the shape of any of the formed segmented electrodes. The cutouts 716 have perimeters 717 extending between adjacent portions of the interior surface 704 of the pre-electrode 700, Each cutout abuts two segmented electrodes with portions of the perimeter 717 forming side-walls of those segmented electrodes. The perimeter 717 of at least one of the cutouts is shaped such that one or more open cavities are formed along at least a portion of the side-wall of £4 least one of the segmented electrodes abutting that cutout. Figures 7A-7C illustrate cutouts that are clover-shaped in transverse cross-section with rnulti-lobed perimeters 717 that define a lateral lobe and one or more side lobes. The side lobes are configured to form opposing cavities (720 in Figure 7C) defined along side-walls (722a and 722b in Figure ?C) of abutting segmented electroties 712. Figure 70 illustrates, in transverse cross-section, the set of segmented electrodes 712 formed alter removal of the connecting material 914 of the pre-electrode 900. The set of segmented electrodes 712 are disposed along the lead body 672. The segmented electrodes 712 include the interior surface 704. an exterior surface 756. and opposing side-walls 722a and 72.2b. extending radially between the interior surface 704 and the exterior surface 756. It will be understood that, although not shown in Figure 7C. the segmented electrodes 712 also include a proximal end and an opposing distal end. These proximal and distal ends are typically the same proximal and distal ends as that of the pre-electrode along which the segmented are disposed (see e.g, Figure 6Β). The interior surfaces 704 of the segmented electrodes 712 are typically defined by the interior surface 704 of the pre-electrode 700, The opposing side-walls 722a and 722b are typically defined by portions of the perimeters 717 of the cutouts 716, In at least some embodiments, when removing the connecting material 714, portions of the perimeter 717 of the cutouts 716 (particularly the lateral-most portions of the perimeter 717) may be removed along with the connecting material 714. 'The exterior surfaces 756 of the segmented electrodes 712 are formed from inner portions of the body 702 of the pre-electrode 700 that previously abutted the connecting material 714 prior to removal of the connecting material 714. In Figure 7(7, the lead body 672 includes the longitudinal surface 676. Optionally, the lead body 672 defines one or more lumens 680 extending along a longitudinal length of the lead body 672 and configured to receive a stylet (see e.g.; 140 in Figure 1), In at least some embodiments, the segmented electrodes 712 are equally spaced-apart from one another around a transverse circumference of the lead body 672. The exterior surfaces 756 of one or more of the segmented electrodes 612 can be inset from, or extended outwardly from, the longitudinal surface 676 of the lead body 672, In Figure 7(7, the exterior surfaces 756 of each of ihe segmented electrodes 712 are shown flush with the longitudinal surface 676 of the lead body 672. it may he advantageous for die exterior surfaces 756 of each of the segmented electrodes 712 to be flush with the longitudinal surface 776 of the lead body 772 in order to maintain an isodiametric profile along a distal end portion of the lead body, thereby reducing the risk of patient tissue getting caught along the lead body during lead insertion. At least one open cavity 720 is defined along at least one of the side-wa] is 722a or 722b of at least one of the segmented electrodes 712. In Figure 7C7 open cavities are defined by the side lobes of the muiti-lobed cutouts. In Figure 7(7, these open cavities are defined along both side-walls 722a and 722b of each of the segmented electrodes 712. The open cavities 720 extend along the entire dimension of the segmented electrode from the proximal end to the distal end. The open cavities do not extend an entire circumferential length of a segmented electrode between opposing side-walls. Additionally, when the open cavities extend circumferentially inwardly along opposing side-wails, the open cavities of the opposing side-wails do not open to one another. In at least some embodiments, at least one of the open cavities is configured to receive, and at least partially retain, at least one conductor ic.y:. a conductor extending between one or more of the electrodes and one or more of the terminals disposed along opposing end portions of the lead). In at least some embodiments, each of the open cavities 720 are configured to receive, and at least partially retain, at least one conductor. In at least some embodiments, at least one of the open cavities 720 is configured to receive, and at least partially retain, at least two, three, four, or more conductors. In f igure 7C, conductors, such as conductor 790, are shown extending along the lead body 672 and received, and at least partially retained, by at least one of the open cavities 720, In Figure 7C, each open cavity 720 is shown receiving a different conductor 790, Additionally. Figure ?C shows some conductors disposed in a center portion of the cutout 716 between open cavities 720 of two different segmented electrodes 712. Typically, the conductors 790 are coated with an electrically insulative material, in at least some embodiments, at least one of the conductors 79U is electrically coupled to at least one of the segmented electrodes, via an electrical coupling interface 794 disposed along the side-wail 722a and 722b within, or in immediate proximity to, the open cavity 720. Turning to Figures 8A-8C, in at least some embodiments die segmented electrodes formed from the pre-electrode define open cavities with transverse cross-sectional profiles that are pointed. Forming open cavities with one or more points may improve adhesion between the segmented electrodes and the lead body. Figures 8Α-·8Β illustrate schematic transverse cross-sectional views of embodiments of a pre-electrode But), The pre-electrode 800 includes a body Β02 that has an intenor surface 804, an outer surface 806, and that defines cutouts 816. The pre-electrode 800 includes individual segmented electrodes 812 joined by connecting material 814 that can be removed (for example, by grinding, machining, etching, ablating, laser cutting, or otherwise removing the connecting material 814) to leave the separated segmented electrodes 812 when the preeiecirode is in place on the lead. The pre-electrode 800 further includes one or more channels 828 formed along the interior surfaces 804 of the segmented electrodes 812 and extending from a proximal end of the pre-electrode to a distal end of the pre-electrode. In Figures 8A-8C, the channels 828 are shown having, a ‘Tr'-shaped transverse cross-sectional profile. In Figure 8 A, the body 802 of the pre-electrode 800 has a closed-loop transverse circumference. In Figure 8Β, the body 802 defines an alignment slit 840. The alignment slit 840 is disposed along one of the cutouts 816 and extends along the entire length of the cutout 816 between a proximal end and a distal end of the body 802, effectively making the body 802 of the pre-electrode 800 open-loop, or C-shaped (/.<?.. the cross-sectional circumference, or outer surface 806, of the pre-electrode is discontinuous). In at least some embodiments, the alignment slit 840 is entirely disposed along one of the cutouts 816- In which case, when the connecting material 814 of the pre-electrode 800 is removed the alignment slit 840 may be at least partially disposed within the spacing between two segmented electrodes of the set of segmented electrodes formed along tire pre-electrode- 800. In at least some embodiments, when the connecting material 814 of the pre-electrode 800 is removed the alignment slit 840 is entirely disposed within the spacing between two segmented electrodes of the set of segmented electrodes formed along the pre-electrode 800, In at least some embodiments, the alignment slit 840 is positioned such that removal of the connecting material 814 causes a corresponding removal of the alignment slit 840 without affecting the shape of any of the formed segmented electrodes. The cutouts 816 have perimeters 817 extending between adjacent portions of the interior surface 804 of the pre-electrode 8ϋϋ. Bach cutout abuts two segmented electrodes with portions of the perimeter 817 forming side-walls of those segmented electrodes. The perimeter 817 of at least one of the cutouts is shaped such that one or more open cavities are formed along at least, a portion of the side-wail of at least one of the segmented electrodes abutting that cutout. Figures 8A-8C illustrate cutouts with perimeters 837 that include medial portions 818 (that are continuous with the interior surface 804 of the pre-electrode) and lateral portions 8 .19 (that are partially removed along with the connecting material 814 and) that intersect along at least one of the open cavities 820 to form an internal ridge extending between the proximal and distal ends of the pre-electrodc. Note that the internal ridge forms a “point” when shown in transverse cross-section. It may be an advantage to form the open cavities 820 with internal ridges (or points in cross-section i to improve adhesion of the lead body to the segmented electrodes of the pre-electrode. Figure SC illustrates, in transverse cross section, the set of segmented electrodes 812 formed after removal of the connecting material 814 of the pre-electrode 800, The segmented electrodes 812 include the interior surface 804, an exterior surface 856, and opposing side-walls 822a and 822b extending radially between the interior surface 804 and the exterior surface 856. It will be understood that, although not shown in Figure 8(2 the segmented electrodes 812 also include a proximal end and ail opposing distal end. These proximal and distal ends are typically the same proximal and distal ends as that of the pre-electrode along which the segmented are disposed (see . Figure 6Β). The interior surfaces 804 of the segmented electrodes 812 are typically the same surfaces as the interior surface 804 of the pre-electrode 800. The opposing side-walls 822a and 822b are typically defined by portions of die perimeters 817 of the cutouts 816. In at least some embodiments, when removing the connecting material 814, portions of the perimeter 817 of the cutouts 816 (particularly the lateral-most, portions of the perimeter 81 7) may be removed along with the connecting material 814, The exterior surfaces 856 of the segmented electrodes 812 are formed from inner portions of the body 802 of the pre-electrode 800 that previously abutted the connecting material 814 prior to removal of the connecting material 814, At least one open cavity 820 is defined along at least one of the side-walls 822a or 822b of at least one of the segmented electrodes 812. In Figure 8 (.2 open cavities are defined along both side-wails 822a and 822b of each of the segmented electrodes 812, The open cavities 820 extend along the entire dimension of the segmented electrode from the proximal end to the distal end.
