BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates generally to medical devices and methods for their fabrication. In particular, the present invention relates to the fabrication of biodegradable endoprostheses, such as stents, having enhanced strength and controlled persistence after implantation. Stents are generally tubular-shaped devices which function to hold open or reinforce a segment of a blood vessel or other body lumen, such as a coronary artery, carotid artery, saphenous vein graft, or femoral artery. They also are suitable to support and hold back a dissected arterial lining that could occlude the body lumen, to stabilize plaque, or to support bioprosthetic valves. Stents can be formed from various materials, particularly polymeric and/or metallic materials, and may be non-degradable, biodegradable, or be formed from both degradable and non-degradable components. Stents are typically delivered to the target area within the body lumen using a catheter. With balloon-expandable stents, the stent is mounted to a balloon catheter, navigated to the appropriate area, and the stent is expanded by inflating the balloon. A self-expanding stent is delivered to the target area and released, expanding to the required diameter to treat the disease. Stents may also elute various drugs and pharmacological agents. Of particular interest to the present invention, biodegradable stents and other endoprostheses are usually formed from polymers which degrade by hydrolysis and other reaction mechanisms in the vascular or other luminal environment over time. For these reasons, it would be desirable to provide improved endoprostheses and methods for their fabrication. 2.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In an aspect of the invention, improved biodegradable endoprostheses and methods for their fabrication are provided. The stent prostheses may be formed from one or more amorphous, semi-crystalline, or crystalline biodegradable polymers. The use of amorphous polymers is preferable in some cases since they can provide relatively short periods of biodegradation, usually less than two years, often less than one year, frequently less than nine months, and sometimes shorter than six months, or even shorter. In some embodiments of the invention, the polymers are modified or treated to introduce a desired degree of crystallinity. In other embodiments, introducing crystallinity into the polymer increases the strength of the polymer so that it is suitable for use as an endoprosthesis and in some cases without substantially lengthening the period of biodegradation after implantation. In other embodiments, the polymeric material is treated to achieve a desired degree of crystallinity. In other embodiments, the polymeric material is treated to control crystallinity. In an embodiment, treatment comprises a heat treatment of the polymeric material or the tubular body preferably at an initial diameter to a temperature above its glass transition temperature of the polymeric material and below its melting point for a period ranging from a fraction of a second to 7 days. Initial diameter is the diameter of the polymeric material or the tubular body as-formed, or the diameter before patterning, or the diameter after patterning, or the diameter before crimping. The polymeric material or the tubular body in one embodiment may be cooled after heating to a temperature ranging from below ambient temperature to ambient or above temperature over a period ranging from a fraction of a second to 7 days. In a preferred embodiment, the tubular body or polymeric material initial diameter is approximately 1-1.5 times the stent deployment diameter. In one embodiment, the tubular body is treated at diameter below initial diameter, or between initial diameter and crimped diameter. In a further embodiment, the treatment comprises heating the tubular body to a temperature about or below Tg for a period ranging from a fraction of a second to 7 days. In another embodiment, the heat treatment at the below initial diameter comprises heat treatment about or above Tg and below Tm for a period ranging from a fraction of a second to 5 hours, or preferably less than 2 hour, or more preferably less than 60 minutes, or most preferably less than 15 minutes. In another embodiment, the polymeric material or the tubular body after forming is treated comprising heat at temperature about or less than Tg. In another embodiment, the tubular body after forming and excluding patterning is treated comprising heat at temperature about or less than Tg. Durations are similar to above ranges. Other suitable temperatures and times are described herein. In another embodiment, the initial diameter is 0.9-1.5 times the stent deployment diameter, or the stent nominal diameter. The stent nominal diameter is the labeled deployment stent diameter. The stent deployment diameter usually is the deployed diameter of the stent at nominal or bigger diameter. In another embodiment, the initial diameter is smaller than the deployed stent diameter or smaller than the labeled stent deployed diameter. In some embodiments, a method according to the present invention for fabricating a biodegradable prosthesis comprises providing a tubular body having an initial diameter, wherein said tubular body is composed at least partially of a substantially amorphous biodegradable polymer, while the diameter remains substantially unchanged; heating the tubular body to a temperature above a glass transition temperature of the polymer and below the melting point of the polymer; cooling the tubular body to increase the crystallinity of the polymer; and patterning the tubular body into a structure capable of radial contraction and expansion. In one embodiment, the stent prosthesis after deployment from a crimped configuration to an expanded diameter in physiologic environment further expands to a larger diameter. In another embodiment, the stent prosthesis after deployment from a crimped configuration to an expanded diameter in physiologic environment further expands to a larger diameter by at least 0.05 mm within 20 minutes. In another embodiment, the stent prosthesis after deployment from a crimped configuration to an expanded diameter in physiologic environment further expands to a larger diameter by at least 0.1 mm within 20 minutes. In another embodiment, the stent prosthesis after deployment from a crimped configuration to an expanded diameter in physiologic environment further expands to a larger diameter substantially apposing the body lumen. The stent prosthesis after deployment from a crimped configuration to an expanded diameter in physiologic environment further expands to a larger diameter substantially apposing the body lumen within 9 months. In another embodiment, the at least some of the struts of the stent prosthesis after deployment from a crimped configuration to an expanded diameter in physiologic environment further expands to a larger diameter substantially apposing the body lumen. In some embodiments, the optional heat treatment of the one or more biodegradable polymeric materials, or the tubular body, the stent material, or the stent may occur at a temperature below Tg, or at about Tg, or at greater than Tg of the one or more biodegradable polymeric materials. In some embodiments, the optional heating may take place at a temperature within 2° C., or within 4° C., or within 6° C., or within 8° C., or within 10° C., or within 12° C., or within 14° C., or within 16° C., or within 18° C., or within 20° C. of Tg of the one or more biodegradable polymeric materials (where “within” may be above or below the Tg). In some embodiments the optional treating, such as heating, may take place for at least about 1×10−12 seconds (s), or at least about 1×10−9 s, or at least about 1×10−6 s, or at least about 1×10−3 s, or at least about 1×10−2 s, or at least about 0.1 s, or at least about 1 s, or at least about 10 s, or at least about 1 minute (min), or at least about 10 min, or at least about 1 hour (h) or at least about 10 h, or at least about 1 day, or at least about 5 days, or at least about 10 days, or at least about 1 month, or at least about 2 months, or at least about 3 months, or at least about 4 months, or at least about 5 months, or at least about 6 months, or at least about 1 year. In some cases, the treating, such as heating, may take place for about 1 min to about 10 min, or about 3 min to about 10 min, or about 5 min to about 10 min, or about 3 min to about 10 min, or about 30 seconds to about 24 hours. In some embodiments, the polymers' crystallinity after modification or treatment is increased by at least 10% of the original crystallinity of the polymer material, preferably by at least 20% of the original crystallinity of the polymer material, preferably by at least 50% of the original crystallinity of the polymer material, and more preferably by at least 100% of the original crystallinity of the polymer material. In other embodiments, the crystallinity of the polymeric material after modification is decreased by at least 10% of the original crystallinity of the polymer material before modification, preferably by at least 20% of the original crystallinity of the polymer material, preferably by at least 50% of the original crystallinity of the polymer material, and more preferably by at least 100% of the original crystallinity of the polymer material, and more preferably by at least 1000% of the original crystallinity of the polymer material. In other embodiments, treatment or modification of the polymeric material has crystallinity that is substantially the same after treatment and before treatment of the polymeric material. In preferred embodiments, polymer materials will have a crystallinity in the range from 10% to 20% after modification as described herein below. In yet other preferred embodiments, polymer materials will have a crystallinity in the range from 1 to 10%, or 10% to 30% after modification. In yet other preferred embodiments, polymer materials will have a crystallinity between 1% and 35% after modification. In yet other preferred embodiments, polymer materials will have a crystallinity between 1% and 40% after modification. As used herein and as known to skilled in the art, “crystallinity” refers to a degree of structural order or perfection within a polymer matrix as known to someone skilled in the art and methods to measure crystallinity as well such as differential scanning calorimetry. In some embodiments, the one or more materials comprising the body, or the stent, or the tubular body may have a controlled crystallinity.

In some embodiments, the polymer or polymeric material after treatment is amorphous, in other embodiments the polymer or polymeric material after treatment is semi-crystalline, yet in other embodiments the polymer or polymeric material after treatment is crystalline. In a preferred embodiment, the polymeric material prior to a treatment is amorphous. In other embodiments, the polymeric material prior to a treatment is semi-crystalline. In a further embodiment, the polymeric material prior to a treatment is crystalline. Crystallinity can be measured by differential scanning calorimetry (Reading, M. et al, Measurement of crystallinity in polymers using modulated temperature differential scanning calorimetry, in Material Characterization by Dynamic and Modulated Thermal Analytical Techniques, ASTM STP 1402, Riga, A. T. et al. Ed, (2001) pp. 17-31. In another aspect of the invention, methods for fabricating biodegradable prostheses are provided. The preferred methods comprise providing a tubular body having an initial diameter as-formed, or before patterning, or after patterning, where the tubular body comprises a biodegradable polymeric material. In one embodiment, the polymeric material comprises one or more polymers, or one or more co-polymers, or a combination thereof.

In another preferred embodiment, the initial diameter is approximately 0.9-1.5 times the stent deployment diameter or stent nominal deployment diameter, or stent labeled deployment diameter. In another embodiment, the initial diameter is smaller than the stent deployment diameter or stent nominal deployment diameter, or stent labeled deployment diameter. The stent deployment diameter in a preferred embodiment is typically the diameter of the stent deployed to approximately nominal or labeled stent diameter but can also be the deployed diameter above the stent nominal or labeled diameter. Stent nominal deployed diameter can be accomplished in one example by inflating the deploying balloon to nominal or labeled diameter to deploy the stent to nominal or labeled diameter. In a preferred embodiment, the polymeric material or the tubular body is patterned at substantially the initial diameter and is crimped subsequently to a crimped diameter that is smaller than the initial diameter.

In a further preferred embodiment, the stent is capable to expand from the crimped diameter to a deployed diameter at about body temperature (in aqueous or water or dry) without fracture and have sufficient strength to support a body lumen. In a further preferred embodiment, the stent is capable to crimp from an expanded diameter, wherein the expanded diameter is larger than the crimped diameter, and expand from the crimped diameter to a deployed diameter at about body temperature (in aqueous or water or dry) without fracture and have sufficient strength to support a body lumen. In some embodiments, sufficient radial strength to support a body lumen is maintained for at least 1 month, or for at least 2 months, for at least 3 months. In some embodiments, the diameter of the scaffold increases after expansion to nominal diameter or between nominal and 1.1 times nominal diameter by 0.1 mm to 0.5 mm between 5 minutes after deployment to an expanded diameter and 1 hour. In other embodiments, the diameter of the scaffold did not substantially decrease over time. In still other embodiments, the diameter of the scaffold did not substantially increase over time. In some embodiments, an expandable stent comprising a biodegradable polymeric material having an initial configuration is provided. The expandable stent at body temperature can be self-expandable from a crimped configuration and further expandable to a second larger configuration. In further embodiments, the polymeric material has been treated to control one or more of crystallinity, Tg, or molecular weight. In some embodiments, the Tg ranges from about 20° C. to about 50° C. In some embodiments, the second configuration is a deployed configuration.

The expandable stent at body temperature can be expandable from a crimped configuration to a first expanded configuration and self expandable to a second larger configuration. In further embodiments, the polymeric material is treated to control one or more of crystallinity, Tg, or molecular weight. In some embodiments, the expandable stent comprises a substantially continuous tubular body.

Fabricating a biodegradable stent can be accomplished through a variety of ways. In a preferred embodiment, the biodegradable stent is fabricated by forming a tubular body using extrusion, molding such as injection molding, dipping, spraying such as spraying a tube or mandrel, printing such as 3D printing. The tubular body in a preferred embodiment is formed first and then patterned into a structure capable of radial expansion from a crimped configuration preferably at body temperature. The tubular body in another preferred embodiment is formed first and then patterned into a structure capable of radial expansion from a crimped configuration preferably at body temperature and preferably without fracture. The tubular body in another preferred embodiment is formed first and then patterned into a structure capable of being crimped from an expanded configuration to a crimped diameter (at temperature about Tg or less than Tg), and at body temperature capable to be expanded from the crimped configuration preferably without fracture. In another preferred embodiment the polymeric material is patterned first and then forms a tubular body/stent capable of radial expansion at body temperature and/or capable to be crimped preferably at temperature about Tg or less than Tg. In another preferred embodiment, the biodegradable stent is fabricated from a sheet (such as a flat sheet) joined at ends (such as opposite ends) to form a tubular body capable of radial expansion preferably at body temperature and/or capable to be crimped preferably at temperature about Tg or less than Tg, and patterned before and/or after joining. Joining sheet ends can be accomplished by a variety of methods such as adhesive, ultrasound, welding, melting the ends, chemical means, or treatment such as heating. The tubular body formed from a sheet can be further treated to control crystallinity and Tg as described in this patent application. The tubular body formed form the sheet has an initial diameter, preferably 1-1.5 times the stent deployed diameter. In other preferred embodiment, the biodegradable stent is fabricated from weaving or braiding polymeric material fibers into a tubular body structure capable of expansion at body temperature and/or capable to be crimped at temperature preferably about Tg or less than Tg. Preferably, weaving or braiding of the polymeric material such as fibers into the initial tubular configuration which is capable of radial expansion at body temperature and/or capable of being crimped from an expanded diameter preferably at temperature about Tg or less than Tg (in aqueous or dry environment) wherein the initial diameter is preferably 1-1.5 times the stent deployed diameter (or the stent nominal diameter, or the stent labeled diameter) and preferably treated at the initial tubular diameter, to achieve controlled crystallinity preferably between 0 and 45%, or more preferably between 0 and 35% and a Tg greater than 37° C. and less than 50° C., or more preferably greater than 37° C. and less than 45° C.) and the stent is capable to expand from a crimped configuration to an expanded configuration/diameter at body temperature and has sufficient strength to support a body lumen, and preferably without fracture. In another preferred embodiment, the stent is capable to be crimped (at temperature preferably about Tg or below Tg), and expand from a crimped configuration to an expanded configuration/diameter at body temperature and has sufficient strength to support a body lumen, and preferably without fracture. In another preferred embodiment, the biodegradable stent is formed using injection molding wherein the polymeric material is loaded inside a mold and the mold is treated once or more to control crystallinity preferably to between 1% and 55% (preferably between 1% and 35%) and treated to control Tg preferably to greater than 37° C. and less than 50° C. (or in another preferred embodiment control Tg to greater than 20° C. and less than 50° C.), or as described within this patent application. The formed patterned tube/stent has an initial diameter, preferably 1-1.5 times the stent deployed diameter, and the treatment can take place before, and/or during, and/or after the molding process and the stent capable to radially expand preferably at body temperature (dry or in aqueous environment). The stent in another embodiment is capable to be expanded from a crimped configuration (which is smaller than the expanded diameter) to an expanded diameter at body temperature and have sufficient strength to support a body lumen, and preferably without fracture. The stent in another embodiment is capable to be crimped from an expanded diameter to a crimped diameter (at temperature preferably about Tg or less than Tg), and expanded from the crimped configuration to an expanded diameter at body temperature and have sufficient strength to support a body lumen, and preferably without fracture. In another preferred embodiment, the biodegradable stent can be fabricated using printing such as 3-D printing wherein the polymeric material is loaded onto the printer and treated to form a patterned tubular body/structure/stent wherein it has an initial diameter, preferably 1-1.5 times the stent deployed diameter, and is treated to control crystallinity and Tg as described within this patent application, and the stent is capable to radially expand at body temperature. The stent in another embodiment is capable to expand from a crimped configuration to an expanded diameter at body temperature and has sufficient strength to support a body lumen, and preferably without fracture. The stent in another preferred embodiment is capable to be crimped from an expanded diameter to a crimped configuration (at temperature preferably about Tg or less than Tg), and expand from the crimped configuration to an expanded diameter at body temperature and has sufficient strength to support a body lumen, and preferably without fracture. Although the preferred embodiment when crimping the stent is at temperature about Tg or less than Tg, crimping the stent can be accomplished at temperature above Tg or within 20° C. above Tg. Although treatment by heat typically ranges from below Tg to below Tm, in some other cases treatment of the polymeric material can be about Tm or above for example when the stent is formed by printing or injection molding. A preferred formation process comprises forming a tube using spraying a polymer or polymeric material comprising one or more polymer, co-polymer- or monomer dissolved in at least one solvent onto a cylindrical mandrel or other structure when the stent prosthesis desired shape is non cylindrical such as oblong shape or other shapes. When the stent prosthesis is not cylindrical, a dimension of the stent may be referred to as “transverse dimension” instead of diameter. Optionally, additives, such as strength-enhancing materials, drugs, or the like, may be dissolved in the solvent or other solvents together with the polymer or polymeric material so that the materials are integrally or monolithically formed with the endoprosthesis tube. Alternatively, methods according to embodiments of the invention may rely on obtaining a pre-formed polymer tube from a supplier or other outside source. In some embodiments, the polymeric tubular body is usually formed as a substantially continuous cylinder free from holes or other discontinuities. In another embodiment, the tubular body has a foraminous wall. In a third embodiment, the tubular body is formed from a continuous tube. In a fourth embodiment, the tubular body comprises a plurality of fibers woven into an expanded diameter, preferably the initial tubular configuration with a diameter preferably of 1-1.5 times the stent deployed diameter and preferably treated at the initial tubular diameter. The polymeric material or the tubular body or deployed stent typically has an outside or inner diameter in the range from 2 mm to 25 mm, preferably 3 mm to 10 mm, or 3.5 mm to 10 mm, and a thickness preferably in the range from 0.01 mm to 0.5 mm, and may be cut into lengths suitable for individual endoprostheses, typically in the range from 5 mm to 40 mm but can also range from 1 mm to 150 cm. In an embodiment, the tubular body may be patterned into a suitable endoprosthesis structure, typically by laser cutting or other conventional processes such as milling, chemical etching, stamping, photolithography, etc. In other embodiments, the stent prosthesis is formed by 3D printing which patterns the tubular body/stent as it is being formed and optionally treated to control crystallinity and Tg to facilitate a stent capable to radially expand at body temperature and support a body lumen and preferably without fracture. In another embodiment, the tubular body comprises a plurality of fibers woven into the initial tubular configuration with a diameter preferably of 1-1.5 times the stent deployed diameter and preferably treated at the initial tubular diameter. In another embodiment, the stent tubular body is formed from a sheet joined at opposite ends and patterned either before or after joining. In some embodiments, as described herein, a biodegradable endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) is formed from a polymeric tube, wherein the tube is a substantially continuous cylinder. In some cases, the substantially continuous cylinder may be substantially free from holes, gaps, voids or other discontinuities. In other embodiments, the tube may be substantially continues yet include some holes, gaps, voids, or other discontinuities. The tubular body may have an outside diameter in the range from about 2 mm to 10 mm, or about 3 mm to about 9 mm, or about 4 mm to about 8 mm, or about 5 mm to about 7 mm. The tubular body may have a thickness in the range from 0.01 mm to 0.5 mm, or about 0.05 mm to about 0.4 mm, or about 0.1 mm to about 0.3 mm. In certain embodiments, the tubular body or polymeric material, or the stent has an initial diameter. In one preferred embodiment, the initial diameter is 1-1.5 times the stent deployed diameter. In another preferred embodiment, the initial diameter is 0.9-1.5 times the stent deployed diameter. In a further embodiment, the initial diameter is less than the stent deployed diameter. The initial diameter can be the as-formed diameter, or the diameter before patterning, or the diameter after patterning, or the diameter before crimping. In one embodiment, an endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) is patterned by laser cutting or other method from a polymeric tube that has a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter substantially equal to or smaller than deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of the endoprosthesis. In other embodiments, an endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) is patterned from a polymeric tube that has a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter, either when the tube is formed or after the tube is radially expanded to a second larger diameter, larger than deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of the endoprosthesis. Patterning a stent from a polymeric tube having a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter larger than deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of the stent can impart advantageous characteristics to the stent, such as reducing radially inward recoil of the stent after deployment and/or improved strength. In certain embodiments, a stent is patterned from a polymeric tube having a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter about 0.85, 0.90, 1.0, 1.05 to about 1.5 times, or about 1.1 to about 1.5 times, or about 1.1 to about 1.3 times, or about 1.15 to about 1.25 times, smaller, same, or larger than an intended deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of the stent. In an embodiment, the stent is patterned from a polymeric tube having a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter about 1.1 to about 1.3 times larger than an intended deployed (e.g., inner) diameter of the stent. For example, a stent having a deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of about 2.5, 3 or 3.5 mm can be patterned from a tube having a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of about 2.75, 3.3 or 3.85 mm (1.1 times larger), or about 3.25, 3.9 or 4.55 mm (1.3 times larger), or some other (e.g., inner or outer) diameter larger than the deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of the stent.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In preferred embodiments, improved biodegradable endoprostheses and methods for their fabrication are provided. The stent prostheses may be formed from one or more amorphous, semi-crystalline, or crystalline biodegradable polymers. In some embodiments of the invention, the polymers are modified or treated to introduce a desired degree of crystallinity. In other embodiments, introducing crystallinity into the polymer increases the strength of the polymer so that it is suitable for use as an endoprosthesis and in some cases without substantially lengthening the period of biodegradation after implantation. In other embodiments, the polymeric material is treated to achieve a desired degree of crystallinity. In other embodiments, the polymeric material is treated to control crystallinity. Some embodiments of the disclosure relate to a biodegradable implantable device comprising a body comprising a material which comprises a biodegradable copolymer or polymer blend or mixture. It is appreciated that any copolymer or polymer blends or mixture described herein can be formed from one, two, three, four or more different monomers or polymers, where each of the monomers or polymers comprising the copolymer or the polymer can be in any amount (e.g., about 0.1% to about 99.9%, or about 0.5% to about 99.5%, or about 1% to about 99%, or about 2% to about 98%, by weight or molarity). The substantially amorphous or semi-crystalline polymeric material or the tubular body formed there from can be modified to control crystallinity (e.g., degree of crystallinity) of the polymeric material. In certain embodiments, the substantially amorphous or semi-crystalline polymeric material or the tubular body formed therefrom undergoes a modification treatment to introduce a desired degree of crystallinity into the polymeric material to increase the strength of the polymeric material without substantially lengthening its degradation time. Additional embodiments of the disclosure relate to biodegradable endoprostheses (e.g., stents) formed at least partially from a substantially amorphous, biodegradable polymer, and to biodegradable endoprostheses comprising a tubular body formed at least partially from a substantially amorphous, biodegradable polymer. In some embodiments, the biodegradable endoprostheses are comprised of a material which comprises a biodegradable polymer, or the biodegradable endoprostheses comprise a tubular body comprised of a material which comprises a biodegradable polymer, wherein the material or the polymer is substantially amorphous or semi-crystalline prior to a modification (or treatment), and crystallinity (e.g., degree of crystallinity) of the material or the polymer increases after the material, the polymer, the tubular body, or the endoprosthesis undergoes the modification. In one embodiment, the crystallinity increases by about 1% to about 40%, or by about 5% to about to about 35%, or by about 10% to about 30, or by about 10% to about 25%, of the original crystallinity prior to modification. In another embodiment, the crystallinity after treatment (modification) is less than about 40%, or less than about 35%, or less than about 30%, or less than about 25%. In one embodiment, the substantially amorphous polymeric material or semi-crystalline material can decrease the period of degradation of the endoprosthesis or the tubular body to, e.g., less than about four years, or less than about three years, or less than about two years, or less than about one year, or less than about nine months, or less than about six months, or shorter. In some embodiments, amorphous biodegradable polymers having less than 10% crystallinity can degrade faster than crystalline polymers but are weaker than crystalline polymers and hence are not typically suitable for vascular implants, such as stents, which need sufficient strength to provide support to the blood vessel. The present invention provides for the modification of polymeric materials to make them suitable for use as biodegradable stents and other endoprostheses. Materials suitable for modification according to the present invention include but are not limited to poly-DL-Lactide, polylactide-co-glycolactide; polylactide-co-polycaprolactone, poly (L-lactide-co-trimethylene carbonate), polytrimethylene carbonate and copolymers; polyhydroxybutyrate and copolymers; polyhydroxyvalerate and copolymers, poly orthoesters and copolymers, poly anhydrides and copolymers, polyiminocarbonates and copolymers and the like. An exemplary stent is made from amorphous material of a copolymer of 85/15 Poly(L-Lactide-co-Glycolide) and processed to increase crystallinity by at least 20% of original crystallinity, preferably by at least 100%, more preferably by at least 1000% of original crystallinity. In one embodiment, the biodegradable stent substantially degrades in less than 2 years, preferable less than 1 year, more preferable less than 9 months. In some embodiments, the polymers' crystallinity of the polymeric material after modification or treatment is increased by at least 10% of the original crystallinity of the polymer material, preferably by at least 20% of the original crystallinity of the polymer material, preferably by at least 50% of the original crystallinity of the polymer material, and more preferably by at least 100% of the original crystallinity of the polymer material. In another embodiment, the initial diameter is 0.9-1.5 times the stent deployment diameter, or the stent nominal diameter. The stent nominal diameter is the labeled deployment stent diameter. The stent deployment diameter usually is the deployed diameter of the stent at nominal or bigger diameter. In another embodiment, the initial diameter is smaller than the deployed stent diameter or smaller than the labeled stent deployed diameter. In a preferred embodiment, the polymeric material prior to a treatment is amorphous. In other embodiments, the polymeric material prior to a treatment is semi-crystalline. In a further embodiment, the polymeric material prior to a treatment is crystalline. In certain embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or the biodegradable polymer or copolymer has a crystallinity or percent crystallinity by X-ray diffraction (XRD) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), by weight or volume of about 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% or 10% to about 70%; or about 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% or 10% to about 60%; or about 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% or 10% to about 55%; or about 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% or 10% to about 50%; or about 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% or 10% to about 40%; or about 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% or 10% to about 30%; or about 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% or 10% to about 25%; or about 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% or 10% to about 20%. In certain embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or the biodegradable polymer copolymer has a degree of crystallinity, or % crystallinity by XRD or DSC, of about 5% to about 30%, or about 7% to about 22%, by weight or volume. In some embodiments, the amorphous biodegradable polymeric material is processed to increase its crystallinity. Increased crystallinity may increase the strength, storage shelf life, and hydrolytic stability of the polymer stent material. The process initiates and/or enhances crystallinity in the polymeric material by nucleating and/or growing small size spherulite crystals in the material. Since the amorphous regions of the modified polymer in some embodiments are preferentially broken down by hydrolysis or enzymatic degradation in biological environment, the modified amorphous biodegradable polymer in those embodiments has increased crystallinity and increased material strength post processing. The increase in crystallinity can be achieved by modifications described in present invention which include at least one of heating, cooling, pressurizing, addition of additives, crosslinking and other processes. The polymer material can be made into a tube by spraying, extrusion, molding, dipping or printing or other process from a selected amorphous copolymer. The amorphous polymer tubing is optionally vacuumed to at least −25 in. Hg, annealed, and quenched to increase crystallinity. In one embodiment, the tube is vacuumed at or below 1 torr at ambient temperature to remove water and solvent. It is then annealed by heating to a temperature above the glass transitional temperature but below melting temperature of the polymer material. Preferably, the annealing temperature is at least 10° C. higher than the glass transitional temperature (Tg), more preferably being at least 20° C. higher, and still more preferably being at least 30° C. higher than the Tg. The annealing temperature is usually at least 5° C. below the melting point (Tm), preferably being at least 20° C. lower, and more preferably being at least 30° C. lower than the Tm of the polymer material. The annealing time is between 1 minute to 10 days, preferably from 30 minutes to 3 hours, and more preferably from 1.5 hours to 2.5 hours. In another embodiment, the treatment comprising heating ranges from a fraction of a second to seven days, preferably from 30 seconds to 3 days, more preferably from 1 minute to 24 hours, and most preferably from 2 minutes to 10 hours. In one embodiment, the heated (annealed) tube is quenched by fast cooling from the annealing temperature to a temperature at or below ambient temperature over a period from 1 second to 1 hour, preferably 1 minute to 30 minutes, and more preferably 5 minutes to 15 minutes. In another embodiment the annealed tune is quenched by slow cooling from the annealing temperature to at or below ambient temperature within 1 hour to 24 hours, preferably 4 hours to 12 hours, and more preferably 6 hours to 10 hours. In some instances the heat treated tube is cooled to a temperature below ambient temperature for a period from 1 minute to 96 hours, more preferably 24 hours to 72 hours, to stabilize the crystals and/or terminate crystallization. This annealing and quenching process initiates and promotes nucleation of crystals in the polymer and increases the mechanical strength of the material. The initial annealing temperature and the cooling rate can be controlled to optimize the size of the crystals and strength of the material. In a further embodiment, the unannealed and/or annealed tube is exposed to ebeam or gamma radiation, with single or multiple doses of radiation ranging from 5 kGy to 100 kGy, more preferably from 10 kGy to 50 kGy. In another embodiment, the biodegradable polymeric stent material can have increased crystallinity by cross-linking such as exposure to radiation such as gamma or ebeam. The cumulative radiation dose can range from 1 kGy to 1000 KGy, preferably 5 to 100 KGy, more preferably 10 to 30 KGy. Crystallinity (e.g., degree of crystallinity) of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising a polymeric material (e.g., a tube) can be controlled by exposure of the polymeric article to carbon dioxide gas or liquid, e.g., under conditions used for controlling solvents and monomers as described herein. When the degree of crystallinity of the polymeric material comprising the polymeric article is relatively low, exposure of the polymeric material to carbon dioxide gas or liquid can control crystallinity by decrease or increase the degree of crystallinity. When the degree of crystallinity of the polymeric material is relatively high, exposure of the polymeric article to carbon dioxide gas or liquid can potentially decrease the degree of crystallinity. Some embodiments of the disclosure relate to biodegradable implantable devices (e.g., a stent) comprising a body (e.g., a tubular body) comprising a material which comprises a biodegradable polymer, copolymer, or polymer blend, wherein the material comprising the body, or the biodegradable polymer, copolymer, or polymer blend, or the stent, has a degree of crystallinity of about 0% to about 70%, or of about 0% to about 55%, or of about 0% to about 30%, or of about 0% to about 25%, or of about 5% to about 70%, or of about 5% to about 55%, or of about 5% to about 30%, or of about 5% to about 25%, or of about 10% to about 70%, or of about 10% to about 55%, or of about 10% to about 30%, or of about 10% to about 25%; or of about 15% to about 70%, or of about 15% to about 55%, or of about 15% to about 30%, or of about 15% to about 25%, or of about 0% to about 40%, or of about 0% to about 35%, or of about 0% to about 25%, or of about 0% to about 20%, or of about 0% to about 15%, or of about 5% to about 40%, or of about 5% to about 35%, or of about 5% to about 25%, or of about 5% to about 20%, or of about 5% to about 15%, or greater than 0% to about 10%, or greater than 1% to about 10%; before modification or treatment, or after modification or treatment, or with a modification or treatment, or without a modification or treatment, or prior to implant, or after sterilization, or before patterning, or after patterning, or the stent, or the tubular body.

In another embodiment, the biodegradable polymer is PLLA polymer that is substantially amorphous before modification and semi crystalline after modification. In another embodiment, the biodegradable polymer is PLLA polymer that is substantially semi crystalline before modification and crystalline after modification. In another embodiment, the biodegradable polymer is PLLA polymer that is substantially amorphous or substantially semi crystalline and/or having a % crystallinity ranging from about 0% to about 30% after a modification and/or having % elongation or shrinkage of about 10% to about 50% after treatment; or of less than 10% after treatment.

In yet another embodiment, various combinations of the embodiments are included. In another embodiment, it is desired to control crystallinity in a manner to preserve the material properties after forming. For example it is desirable to treat the tubular body or the biodegradable polymeric material wherein the crystallinity of the tubular body after forming is substantially unchanged from the crystallinity of the stent prosthesis material prior to implant. In such cases, the treatment(s) of the biodegradable polymeric material controls maintaining crystallinity to be substantially the same. In another embodiment, it is desired to control crystallinity in a manner to lower crystallinity after forming or after treatment. For example it is desirable to treat the tubular body or the biodegradable polymeric material wherein the crystallinity of the stent prosthesis material prior to implant is lower than the crystallinity of the tubular body after forming. The biodegradable stent prosthesis comprising a tubular body comprising a biodegradable polymeric material, wherein the tubular body has been formed using extrusion, molding, dipping, or spraying, said biodegradable polymeric material has an initial crystallinity and has a Tg greater than 37° C. and the stent prosthesis has a crystallinity (biodegradable stent material) that is substantially the same as the initial crystallinity and at body temperature is radially expandable and has sufficient strength to support a body lumen. In certain embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or the biodegradable polymer or copolymer has a crystallinity or percent crystallinity by X-ray diffraction (XRD) or differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), by weight or volume of about 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% or 10% to about 70%; or about 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% or 10% to about 60%; or about 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% or 10% to about 55%; or about 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% or 10% to about 50%; or about 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% or 10% to about 40%; or about 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% or 10% to about 30%; or about 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% or 10% to about 25%; or about 0%, 1%, 2%, 5% or 10% to about 20%. In certain embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or the biodegradable polymer copolymer has a degree of crystallinity, or % crystallinity by XRD or DSC, of about 5% to about 30%, or about 7% to about 22%, by weight or volume. In a preferred embodiment, there is a desire to minimize the amount of heat and/or duration the tubular body or the stent or the biodegradable material sees after forming.

In one embodiment, the Tg is greater than 37° C. and less than 60° C., preferably greater than 37° C. and less than 55° C., more preferably greater than 37° C. and less than 45° C., more preferably greater than 35° C. and less than 45° C. In certain embodiments, the degree of crystallinity is controlled in the polymeric material to about 40% or less, or about 35% or less, or about 30% or less, or about 25% or less, or about 20% or less, or about 15% or less, or about 10% or less, or about 8% or less, or about 6% or less, or about 4% or less, or about 2% or less, prior to a modification (or treatment) or after modification. In an embodiment, the degree of crystallinity of a polymeric material is about 10% or less prior to a modification. In some embodiments, after a substantially amorphous or semi crystalline or crystalline polymeric material or a tubular body formed therefrom undergoes a modification, the degree of crystallinity of the polymeric material is controlled such as to increases or decrease by at least about 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 100%, 150%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%, 600%, 700%, 800%, 900% or 1000% (e.g., of the initial degree of crystallinity or before treatment). In an embodiment, after a substantially amorphous or semi crystalline or crystalline polymeric material or a tubular body formed therefrom undergoes a modification, the degree of crystallinity of the polymeric material increases by at least about 50%.

In an embodiment, the polymeric material or a tubular body formed therefrom undergoes a modification, the polymeric material has a degree of crystallinity of about 10% to about 40%. In another embodiment, the polymer material or tubular body or stent comprises PLLA/PCL (polymer blend or copolymers), wherein the tubular body is substantially oriented, or at least axially oriented, or biaxially oriented, or substantially randomly oriented, or substantially not oriented. In another embodiment, the polymer material is PLLA/PCL (polymer blend or copolymers) and an additive of carbon nano tube or fibers are added to it. The amounts of carbon nano tube or fibers ranges from about 0.1% to about 15%. In another embodiment, the polymer material comprises PLLA/PCL/PGA (polymer blend or copolymers or a mixture of copolymers and polymer blend) and an additive of carbon nano tube or fibers added to it.

In further embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of an endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent), or comprising the polymeric article/material (e.g., a polymeric tube) from which the endoprosthesis is formed, has a degree of crystallinity of about 2%, 5% or 10% to about 70%, or about 2%, 5% or 10% to about 60%, or about 2%, 5% or 10% to about 50%, or about 2%, 5% or 10% to about 40%, or about 2%, 5% or 10% to about 30%, or about 2%, 5% or 10% to about 20%, or has a degree of crystallinity of at least about 2%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% or 70%, after the polymeric article and/or the endoprosthesis undergo the modification or treatment. In certain embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the polymeric article or the body of the endoprosthesis has a degree of crystallinity of about 5% to about 50%, or about 10% to about 40%, after the polymeric article and/or the endoprosthesis undergo the modification. Increased crystallinity may increase the strength, storage shelf life, and/or hydrolytic stability of the polymeric material or the endoprosthesis formed therefrom. The modification may introduce or enhance crystallinity in the polymeric material by nucleating or growing small spherulite crystals in the polymeric material. Modification of a polymeric material can include longitudinal extension, radial expansion, heating, cooling, pressurizing, vacuuming, addition of an additive, crosslinking, exposure to radiation (e.g., e-beam or gamma radiation), exposure to carbon dioxide gas or liquid, or other modifications described herein, or a combination thereof. Additional embodiments of the disclosure relate to biodegradable endoprostheses comprised of a material which comprises a biodegradable polymer, or biodegradable endoprostheses comprising a tubular body comprised of a material which comprises a biodegradable polymer, wherein the material or the polymer is substantially amorphous or semi crystalline or crystalline prior to a modification (or treatment), and crystallinity (e.g., degree of crystallinity) of the material or the polymer increases or decreases after the material, the polymer, the tubular body or the endoprosthesis undergoes the modification. In one embodiment, the crystallinity increases or decreases from about 1% to about 30%, in another embodiment, the crystallinity increases from about 1% to about 20%, or from about 1% to about 10%, or no more than 10%. Substantially amorphous or semi-crystalline, biodegradable polymers having a degree of crystallinity of, e.g., about 30% or less, or 20% or less, or 10% or less may degrade faster than crystalline polymers. The present disclosure provides for modifications (or treatments) of polymers, preferably substantially amorphous or semi crystalline polymeric materials to increase crystallinity of biodegradable endoprostheses, e.g., or by increasing the strength of the polymeric material without substantially increasing its degradation time. In certain embodiments, a biodegradable endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) formed from a substantially amorphous or semi crystalline polymeric material that has undergone a modification substantially completely degrades in less than about four years, or less than about three years, or less than about two years, or less than about one year, or less than about nine months, or less than about six months. In some embodiments, a biodegradable endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) is formed from a biodegradable polymeric material, wherein crystallinity (e.g., degree of crystallinity) of the polymeric material is controlled by increasing or decreasing after the polymeric material undergoes a modification (or treatment). In certain embodiments, the degree of crystallinity of the polymeric material increases or decreases by at least about 10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 150%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%, 600%, 700%, 800%, 900% or 1000% after the polymeric material undergoes the modification. In certain embodiments, the degree of crystallinity of polymeric material increases by at least about 25% or 50% after the polymeric material undergoes the modification. In one embodiment, the biodegradable polymeric stent material has increased crystallinity by using a combination of solvents, with one solvent having solubility parameter within 10% of the solubility parameter of the polymer and the second solvent having solubility parameter at least 10% different than the solubility parameter of the polymer in the solvent. In one embodiment the biodegradable polymer stent material has a crystallinity of greater than 10%, preferably greater than 25%, more preferably greater than 50%. In other embodiments, treatment to control crystallinity takes place in such a way as to decrease it after treatment. Examples include decreasing the crystallinity by at least 5%-50%, preferably by at least 10% to 30%. In some embodiments, the invention also provides means to improve consistency of strength, recoil or degradation rate of a biodegradable polymer stent material. Another way to control crystallinity of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of an endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent), or comprising the polymeric article/material (e.g., a tube) from which the endoprosthesis is formed, is to use a combination of solvents in which the polymeric material has different solubilities (e.g., when the polymeric article is being formed). For example, one solvent can have a solubility parameter within about 20% (or 10%) of the solubility parameter of the polymeric material, and the second solvent can have a solubility parameter at least about 20% (or 10%) different than the solubility parameter of the polymeric material in the solvent.

The teachings disclosed herein can be applied to make any appropriate implantable device from a polymeric article comprised of a biodegradable polymeric material. The implantable device can be any implantable device described herein, and may have a tubular body (e.g., a stent) or may not have a tubular body. The polymeric article can have any shape, form and dimensions suitable for making the device (e.g., a polymeric tube from which a stent is patterned). In another aspect of the invention, methods for fabricating biodegradable prostheses are provided. The preferred methods comprise providing a tubular body having an initial diameter as-formed, or before patterning, or after patterning, where the tubular body comprises a biodegradable polymeric material. In one embodiment, the polymeric material comprises one or more polymers, or one or more co-polymers, or a combination thereof. In another embodiment, the polymeric material comprises one or more polymers, or one or more co-polymers, or one or more monomers, or a combination thereof. The polymeric material or the tubular body is treated to control crystallinity preferably to between 1% and 50%, or more preferably to between 1% and 35%. In one embodiment the polymeric material or the tubular body treatment comprises a heat treatment preferably at substantially the initial diameter, preferably when the initial diameter is 1-1.5 times the stent deployment diameter, to a temperature above glass transition temperature of the polymeric material and below its melting point for a period ranging from a fraction of a second to 7 days. The polymeric material or the tubular body in one embodiment may be cooled after heating to a temperature ranging from below ambient temperature to ambient or above temperature over a period ranging from a fraction of a second to 7 days. In a preferred embodiment, the polymeric material or the tubular body initial diameter is approximately 1-1.5 times the stent deployment diameter or stent nominal deployment diameter, or stent labeled deployment diameter. In another preferred embodiment, the initial diameter is approximately 0.9-1.5 times the stent deployment diameter or stent nominal deployment diameter, or stent labeled deployment diameter. The biodegradable implantable device can be made using any suitable method, such as spraying, dipping, extrusion, molding, injection molding, compression molding or 3-D printing, using, e.g., BFB3000 from Bits From Bytes company (UK), or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the body of the device is formed from a polymeric article made by spraying a solution or mixture containing the biodegradable copolymer or polymer and a solvent onto a structure. In a preferred embodiment, the biodegradable stent is fabricated by forming a tubular body using extrusion, molding such as injection molding, dipping, spraying such as spraying a tube or mandrel, printing such as 3D printing. The tubular body in a preferred embodiment is formed first and then patterned into a structure capable of radial expansion from a crimped configuration preferably at body temperature. The tubular body in another preferred embodiment is formed first and then patterned into a structure capable of radial expansion from a crimped configuration preferably at body temperature and preferably without fracture. The tubular body in another preferred embodiment is formed first and then patterned into a structure capable of being crimped from an expanded configuration to a crimped diameter (at temperature about Tg or less than Tg), and at body temperature capable to be expanded from the crimped configuration preferably without fracture.

In some embodiments, the second configuration is a deployed configuration. In some embodiments, the stent expands to the first and second configurations without fracture and has sufficient strength to support a body lumen. In some embodiments, the first expanded configuration has a transverse dimension of at least 0.35 times, or at least 0.45 times, or at least 0.55 times, or at least 0.55 times, or at least 0.7 times, or at least 0.8 times, or at least 1 times the transverse dimension of the initial configuration. In some embodiments, the stent expands to the first expanded configuration within a period of 24 hours, or 12 hours, or 4 hours, or 2 hours, or 1 hour, or 30 minutes, or 5 minutes or 30 seconds.

In some embodiments, the first expanded configuration is a deployed configuration. In some embodiments, the stent has a nominal expanded configuration with a transverse dimension and the first expanded configuration has a transverse dimension that is 1 time, or 1.1 times, or 1.2 times, or 1.3 times, or 1.35 times, or 1.4 times, or 1.45 times, or 1.5 times the transverse dimension of the transverse dimension of the nominal expanded configuration.

In other embodiments, the polymer solution or mixture is sprayed onto the structure at a temperature below or above ambient temperature. In further embodiments, the polymer solution or mixture is sprayed onto the structure in ambient environment. In other embodiments, the polymer solution or mixture is sprayed onto the structure in a substantially inert environment (e.g., in the presence of nitrogen or argon gas). In additional embodiments, the polymer solution or mixture is sprayed onto the structure in an environment having a relative humidity of about 70% or less, or about 60% or less, or about 50% or less, or about 40% or less, or about 30% or less. In certain embodiments, the polymer solution or mixture is sprayed onto the structure in an environment having a relative humidity of about 50% or less. The first biodegradable polymer can be any biodegradable polymer (including homopolymer or copolymer) described herein. In some embodiments, the first biodegradable polymer is a polylactide homopolymer or copolymer, wherein lactide includes L-lactide, D-lactide and D,L-lactide. In certain embodiments, the first biodegradable polymer is a poly(L-lactide) copolymer. The poly(L-lactide) copolymer can comprise L-lactide and one or more other monomers selected from any of the monomers described herein. In some embodiments, the biodegradable poly(L-lactide) copolymer comprises L-lactide in at least about 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5% or 99.9% by weight or molarity, and each of the one or more other monomers in no more than about 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, 3%, 3.5%, 4%, 4.5%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25% or 30% by weight or molarity. In certain embodiments, the biodegradable poly(L-lactide) copolymer comprises L-lactide in at least about 90%, 95% or 99% by weight or molarity, and each of the one or more other monomers in no more than about 1%, 5% or 10% by weight or molarity. In certain embodiments, the first biodegradable polymer is selected from the group consisting of poly(L-lactide), poly(D-lactide), poly(D,L-lactide), polydioxanone, poly(4-hydroxybutyrate), polysalicylate/polysalicylic acid, poly(propylene carbonate), poly(tyrosine carbonate), poly(cellulose acetate butyrate), poly(L-lactide-co-D-lactide), poly(L-lactide-co-D,L-lactide), poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide), poly(L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone), poly(L-lactide-co-dioxanone), poly(L-lactide-co-3-hydroxybutyrate), poly(L-lactide-co-4-hydroxybutyrate), poly(L-lactide-co-4-hydroxyvalerate), poly(L-lactide-co-ethylene carbonate), poly(L-lactide-co-propylene carbonate), poly(L-lactide-co-trimethylene carbonate), and poly(L-lactide-co-cellulose acetate butyrate). In further embodiments, the first biodegradable polymer is a block or random copolymer of L-lactide and ε-caprolactone in a weight or molar ratio of about 70:30 to about 99.9:0.1, or about 80:20 to about 99.9:0.1, or about 85:15 to about 99.9:0.1, or about 85:15 to about 95:5, or about 87:13 to about 93:7, or about 90:10. In an embodiment, the first biodegradable polymer is a random copolymer of L-lactide and ε-caprolactone in a weight or molar ratio of about 90:10. In other embodiments, the first biodegradable polymer is a block or random copolymer of L-lactide and glycolide in a weight or molar ratio of about 70:30 to about 99.9:0.1, or about 75:25 to about 95:5, or about 80:20 to about 90:10, or about 82:18 to about 88:12, or about 85:15. In an embodiment, the first biodegradable polymer is a random copolymer of L-lactide and glycolide in a weight or molar ratio of about 85:15. The first solvent can be any solvent (a single solvent or a mixture of solvents) that dissolves to a suitable extent, and is compatible with, the first biodegradable polymer and any additional material (e.g., an additional polymer, a biologically active agent or an additive, or a combination thereof) in the first solution or mixture, and results in suitable characteristics of the polymeric article (e.g., minimal amount of residual solvent after removal of the solvent, if desired). Non-limiting examples of solvents include hydrocarbon solvents, toluene, xylenes, 1,2-xylene, 1,3-xylene, 1,4-xylene, halogenated hydrocarbon solvents, dichloromethane, chloroform, trichlorofluoromethane, (1,1,1,3,3,3)-hexafluoro-2-propanol, ethers, diethyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, ketones, acetone, esters, ethyl acetate, tert-butyl acetate, alcohols, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, tert-butanol, amines, diethylamine, and mixtures thereof. In certain embodiments, the first solvent is dichloromethane, or tetrahydrofuran, or acetone. The choice of concentration of a polymer in a spray solution or mixture may be based on various factors, such as the viscosity of the polymer, the type of solvent and the type of spray equipment used. Examples of spray equipments that can be used include, but are not limited to, MicroMist sprayers from Sono-Tek (New York) and 784S-SS Aseptic sprayers from EFD (Rhode Island). In some embodiments, the concentration of the first biodegradable polymer in the first solution or mixture is about 0.1 or 1 mg/mL to about 20 mg/mL, or about 0.5 or 1 mg/mL to about 15 mg/mL, or about 1 or 2 mg/mL to about 10 mg/mL, or about 3 mg/mL to about 7 mg/mL, or about 4 mg/mL to about 6 mg/mL. In certain embodiments, the concentration of the first biodegradable polymer in the first solution or mixture is about 1 mg/mL to about 10 mg/mL, or about 5 mg/mL. In some embodiments, the structure onto which the polymer solution or mixture is sprayed has a substantially flat surface or a contour surface, or both. In further embodiments, the structure has an irregular surface, or a surface having surface features. In certain embodiments, the irregular surface, or the surface having surface features, of the structure has one or more protrusions, and/or one or more indentations, where the protrusions and/or the indentations can be arranged in a regular or irregular manner on the surface. The protrusions and/or the indentations on the surface of the structure can be formed as indentations and/or protrusions, respectively, on the corresponding (e.g., inner) surface of the polymeric article spray coated on the structure for any of a variety of purposes. For example, a polymeric article having indentations and/or protrusions on a surface can be used to make a device that has a variable thickness along its length, which can, e.g., increase its longitudinal flexibility. As another example, indentations and/or protrusions on a surface of a device can promote endothelialization of the device with the surrounding tissue after implantation of the device. As a further example, indentations on a surface of a device can contain one or more biologically active agents, or one or more additives, or both. The structure onto which the polymer solution or mixture is sprayed can have any shape, configuration or form suitable for making a polymeric article. In certain embodiments, the structure is a substantially cylindrical or tubular structure (e.g., a mandrel, rod, tube or balloon), which can be used to make a polymeric article from which, e.g., a single stent, segmented stent, joined stent or overlap stent can be patterned. In further embodiments, the structure is a tapered tubular structure (e.g., a tapered mandrel, rod, tube or balloon), which can be used to make a polymeric article from which, e.g., a tapered stent can be patterned. In additional embodiments, the structure is a substantially Y-shaped cylindrical or tubular structure (e.g., a substantially Y-shaped mandrel, rod or tube), which can be used to make a polymeric article from which, e.g., a bifurcated stent can be patterned. Further, the polymeric article can have any shape, configuration or form suitable for making an implantable device from the polymeric article. In certain embodiments, the polymeric article is a polymeric sheet. In other embodiments, the polymeric article is a polymeric tube. When the polymeric article is a polymeric tube, in some embodiments the polymeric tube is substantially concentric. If a stent is patterned from a polymeric tube, a more concentric tube can result in more uniform thickness of struts, crowns and links of the stent. In some embodiments, the polymeric tube has a concentricity of about 0.0025 inch (about 64 microns) or less, or about 0.002 inch (about 51 microns) or less, or about 0.0015 inch (about 38 microns) or less, or about 0.001 inch (about 25 microns) or less, or about 0.0005 inch (about 13 microns) or less. In further embodiments, the polymeric tube has a percent concentricity of at least about 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%. In certain embodiments, the polymeric tube has a concentricity of about 0.001 inch (about 25 microns) or less, or a percent concentricity of at least about 90%. A substantially concentric polymeric tube can be made by, e.g., slowly forming a tube thickness by spraying a solution or mixture of relatively low polymer concentration onto a mandrel that is constantly rotating (clockwise and counter-clockwise) and moving axially (back and forth over the length of the mandrel). In some embodiments, the first solution or mixture containing the first biodegradable polymer contains an additional biodegradable polymer or a non-degradable polymer, or both. The additional biodegradable polymer can be any biodegradable polymer described herein, and the non-degradable polymer can be any non-degradable polymer described herein. In some embodiments, the first solution or mixture contains poly(L-lactide) or a poly(L-lactide) copolymer, and an additional biodegradable polymer or a non-degradable polymer or both. In certain embodiments, the first solution or mixture contains poly(L-lactide) and poly(ε-caprolactone). The first biodegradable polymer, and any optional additional biodegradable polymer and/or any optional non-degradable polymer, can be treated prior to preparation of the first solution or mixture to remove substantially residual water, solvent(s), monomer(s), low molecular weight oligomer(s) and/or particulate(s) from the polymer(s). In further embodiments, the first biodegradable polymer, and any optional additional biodegradable polymer and/or any optional non-degradable polymer, are exposed to an extracting solvent (e.g., an alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol), or to carbon dioxide gas or liquid under elevated pressure (e.g., at least about 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 or 1000 psi for carbon dioxide gas, or at least about 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 or 5000 psi for carbon dioxide liquid) and optionally under a flow of carbon dioxide, e.g., at least about 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 ccm (cubic centimeter per minute), optionally at reduced or elevated temperature, for a period of time (e.g., at least about 1, 6, 12, 24, 36 or 48 hours) prior to preparation of the first solution or mixture containing the polymer(s). In additional embodiments, the first solution or mixture containing the first biodegradable polymer contains one or more biologically active agents, or one or more additives, or both. The biologically active agent(s) can be any biologically active agent described herein, and the additive(s) can be any additive described herein. In certain embodiments, the biologically active agent(s) include myolimus or novolimus. Applying a mixture containing two or more substances or materials having significantly different surface tensions can result in phase separation of the substances or materials. The following provides embodiments of ways for minimizing or preventing phase separation of substances or materials. Substances or materials having a substantially similar surface tension are applied. If the substances or materials have significantly different surface tensions, a surfactant can be added to the mixture. Exposure of the polymeric article to heat (in terms of, e.g., temperature and exposure time) is minimized during processing and during any sterilization or storage of the article, and exposure of the device formed from the polymeric article to heat is minimized during processing, sterilization and storage (e.g., the device is frozen during sterilization with radiation and during storage). In some embodiments, the method of making the device comprises: (i) spraying the first solution or mixture containing the first biodegradable polymer and the first solvent onto the structure to form a first layer containing the first biodegradable polymer, and spraying a second solution or mixture containing a second biodegradable polymer and a second solvent over at least a portion of the first layer containing the first biodegradable polymer to form a second layer of the polymeric article which contains the second biodegradable polymer; or (ii) spraying a second solution or mixture containing a second biodegradable polymer and a second solvent onto the structure to form a first layer containing the second biodegradable polymer, and spraying the first solution or mixture containing the first biodegradable polymer and the first solvent over at least a portion of the first layer containing the second biodegradable polymer to form a second layer of the polymeric article which contains the first biodegradable polymer. The second biodegradable polymer can be any biodegradable polymer described herein. In certain embodiments, the second solution or mixture containing the second biodegradable polymer contains an additional biodegradable polymer or a non-degradable polymer, or both. The additional biodegradable polymer can be any biodegradable polymer described herein, and the non-degradable polymer can be any non-degradable polymer described herein. Prior to preparation of the second solution or mixture, the second biodegradable polymer, and any optional additional biodegradable polymer and/or any optional non-degradable polymer, can be treated as described herein, e.g., to remove residual water, solvent(s), monomer(s), low molecular weight oligomer(s) and/or particulate(s) from the polymer(s). In certain embodiments, the second solution or mixture containing the second biodegradable polymer contains one or more biologically active agents, or one or more additives, or both. The biologically active agent(s) can be any biologically active agent described herein, and the additive(s) can be any additive described herein. The method of making the device can also comprise spraying a third solution or mixture containing a third biodegradable polymer and a third solvent, a fourth solution or mixture containing a fourth biodegradable polymer and a fourth solvent, a fifth solution or mixture containing a fifth biodegradable polymer and a fifth solvent, or additional polymer solution or mixture to form a third layer containing the third biodegradable polymer, a fourth layer containing the fourth biodegradable polymer, a fifth layer containing the fifth biodegradable polymer, or additional polymer layer of the polymeric article, where the first layer, the second layer, the third layer, the fourth layer, the fifth layer, or additional layer can be in any order. The optional third biodegradable polymer, the optional fourth biodegradable polymer and the optional fifth biodegradable polymer can independently be any biodegradable polymer described herein. The optional third solution or mixture containing the third biodegradable polymer, the optional fourth solution or mixture containing the fourth biodegradable polymer, and the optional fifth solution or mixture containing the fifth biodegradable polymer can each optionally and independently contain an additional biodegradable polymer or a non-degradable polymer, or both. The additional biodegradable polymer and/or the non-degradable polymer optionally in the third solution or mixture, the fourth solution or mixture, and/or the fifth solution or mixture can independently be any biodegradable polymer described herein and any non-degradable polymer described herein. Prior to preparation of the optional third solution or mixture, the optional fourth solution or mixture, and/or the optional fifth solution or mixture, the third biodegradable polymer, the fourth biodegradable polymer, and/or the fifth biodegradable polymer, and any optional additional biodegradable polymer and/or any optional non-degradable polymer, can be treated as described herein, e.g., to remove residual water, solvent(s), monomer(s), low molecular weight oligomer(s) and/or particulate(s) from the polymer(s). The optional third solution or mixture containing the third biodegradable polymer, the optional fourth solution or mixture containing the fourth biodegradable polymer, and the optional fifth solution or mixture containing the fifth biodegradable polymer can each optionally and independently contain one or more biologically active agents, or one or more additives, or both. The biologically active agent(s) and/or the additive(s) optionally in the third solution or mixture, the fourth solution or mixture, and/or the fifth solution or mixture can independently be any biologically active agent described herein and any additive described herein. In some embodiments, the method of making the device comprises crosslinking the first biodegradable polymer, the optional second biodegradable polymer, the optional third biodegradable polymer, the optional fourth biodegradable polymer, or the optional fifth biodegradable polymer, or any optional additional biodegradable polymer or any optional non-degradable polymer in the first layer, the optional second layer, the optional third layer, the optional fourth layer, or the optional fifth layer of the polymeric article, or crosslinking any combination of the aforementioned polymers. In certain embodiments, the polymer(s) are crosslinked by exposure to radiation (e.g., ultraviolet, e-beam or gamma radiation), exposure to heat, use of a degradable or non-degradable crosslinker, or use of a crosslinking agent and an initiator, as described herein. The method of making the device can also comprise forming one or more layers comprising a corrodible metal or metal alloy, and optionally a non-corrodible metal or metal alloy, to form the polymeric article. The polymeric article can comprise one or more polymer layers and one or more metal layers in any order. For example, a metal layer, or each of multiple metal layers, or multiple metal layers, can lie between polymer layers of the polymeric article. Further, the one or more metal layers can be applied as a first outer layer, and/or as a second outer layer, of the polymeric article. For example, when the device is a stent, the one or more metal layers can be applied as a first outer layer, and/or as a second outer layer, of the polymeric tube which correspond to the luminal surface and the abluminal surface of the stent. A metal layer can be applied using any suitable method, e.g., by applying a metal film, foil or tube onto the structure (e.g., a structure having a flat surface and/or a contour surface) or over a polymer layer. If the implantable device is a stent, a stent can be patterned from the polymeric article comprising one or more polymer layers and one or more metal layers using any suitable method (e.g., laser or mechanical cutting). Alternatively, a metal film, foil or tube having the desired stent pattern can be applied onto a mandrel or over a polymer layer (e.g., a metal tube having the desired stent pattern and a slightly larger diameter than the polymeric article can be crimped onto the polymeric article). To enhance adhesion of a metal layer to a polymer layer and/or prevent separation or delamination thereof, the metal layer can be textured or treated, before and/or after being applied onto the structure or over a polymer layer, to form surface roughness, surface irregularities or surface features on one or more surfaces of the metal layer. Surface roughness, surface irregularities and surface features of the metal layer can include, but are not limited to, protrusions, spikes, pillars, ridges, mounds, bumps, textures, scratches, scores, streaks, dents, indentations, recesses, trenches, pores, pits, holes and cavities. Surface roughness, surface irregularities or surface features can be formed on the metal layer, before and/or after the metal layer is applied, by any suitable method, such as microblasting, beadblasting, sandblasting, treatment with a corrosive agent, treatment with an acid or base, treatment with water, chemical etching, physical or mechanical etching, or laser treatment, or a combination thereof. The specific corrodible metal or metal alloy in a metal layer and the thickness of the metal layer can be selected to control characteristics of the device, e.g., strength and degradation. If a non-corrodible metal or metal alloy is used in a metal layer, the specific non-corrodible metal or metal alloy and the amount thereof can be selected to impart desired characteristics (e.g., enhanced strength and/or radiopacity) without unduly prolonging the degradation time of the device. In some embodiments, the thickness (e.g., average thickness) of a metal layer is about 100 microns or less, or about 80 microns or less, or about 60 microns or less, or about 50 microns or less, or about 40 microns or less, or about 30 microns or less, or about 20 microns or less, or about 10 microns or less, or about 5 microns or less. In certain embodiments, the thickness (e.g., average thickness) of a metal layer is about 30 microns or less, or about 20 microns or less. As a non-limiting example of potential benefits of a metal layer, the presence of one or more metal layers comprising a corrodible metal or metal alloy, and optionally a non-corrodible metal or metal alloy, in the body of a stent can enhance the strength of the stent and allow the struts, crowns and/or links of the stent to have a smaller thickness and/or a smaller width, thereby decreasing the amount of polymeric material used to make the body. In addition to increasing the strength of the device, use of a non-corrodible metal or metal alloy in a metal layer, or as an additive, in the body of the device or in a coating on the device can increase the radiopacity of the device, which may dispense with the use of a radiopaque marker. Non-limiting examples of corrodible metals and metal alloys that can independently comprise any metal layer(s) of the body of the device include cast ductile irons (e.g., 80-55-06 grade cast ductile iron), corrodible steels (e.g., AISI 1010 steel, AISI 1015 steel, AISI 1430 steel, AISI 5140 steel and AISI 8620 steel), melt-fusible metal alloys, bismuth-tin alloys (e.g., 40% bismuth-60% tin and 58% bismuth-42% tin), bismuth-tin-indium alloys, magnesium alloys, tungsten alloys, zinc alloys, shape-memory metal alloys, and superelastic metal alloys. Examples of non-corrodible metals and metal alloys that can optionally and independently comprise any metal layer(s) include without limitation stainless steels (e.g., 316L stainless steel), cobalt-chromium alloys (e.g., L-605 and MP35N cobalt-chromium alloys), nickel-titanium alloys, gold, palladium, platinum, tantalum, and alloys thereof. The polymeric article, whether associated with the structure or removed from the structure, can be treated to remove residual water, solvent(s), monomer(s), low molecular weight oligomer(s) and/or particulate(s) from the article. In some embodiments, the polymeric article is subjected to reduced pressure or heated at elevated temperature (e.g., at least about 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100° C.), or both, for a period of time (e.g., at least about 0.5, 1, 6, 12, 24, 36 or 48 hours). In further embodiments, the polymeric article is exposed to an extracting solvent (e.g., an alcohol, such as methanol or ethanol), or to carbon dioxide gas or liquid under elevated pressure (e.g., at least about 500, 600, 700, 800, 900 or 1000 psi for carbon dioxide gas, or at least about 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000 or 5000 psi for carbon dioxide liquid) and optionally under a flow of carbon dioxide (e.g., at least about 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 ccm), optionally at reduced or elevated temperature, for a period of time (e.g., at least about 0.5, 1, 6, 12, 24, 36 or 48 hours). In certain embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the polymeric article or the body of the device, or the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising each layer of the polymeric article or the body of the device, comprises about 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.5, 1, 0.5 or 0.1 wt % or less of each of water, solvent(s), monomer(s), low molecular weight oligomer(s) or particulate(s), or a combination thereof. In an embodiment, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the polymeric article or the body of the device, or the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising each layer of the polymeric article or the body of the device, comprises about 2 wt % or less of each of water, solvent(s), monomer(s), low molecular weight oligomer(s) or particulate(s), or a combination thereof. The polymeric article, whether associated with the structure or removed from the structure, can also undergo any of a variety of treatments designed, e.g., to control crystallinity, enhance the strength or toughness of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the article, and/or reduce residual or internal stress in the polymeric article. Control of crystallinity (e.g., degree of crystallinity) of the polymeric material can achieve a suitable balance between the radial strength (important for, e.g., support of the treated tubular tissue in the subject) and the toughness (important for, e.g., resistance to cracking and fatigue) of the polymeric material. In certain embodiments, the polymeric article is removed from the structure prior to undergoing a modification or treatment. In some other embodiments, it is not removed for at least one modification. The polymeric article can also be deformed (e.g., contracted or expanded) in any direction. Deforming the polymeric article in a direction can increase its strength along that direction (e.g., increase its resistance to force applied in that direction). Furthermore, deforming the polymeric article in a direction can align polymer chains substantially in that direction and can induce crystallization and increase crystallinity of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the polymeric article, or can align amorphous polymer chains substantially in that direction without necessarily inducing crystallization of the amorphous polymeric region or increasing crystallinity of the material (e.g., polymeric material). In certain embodiments, the polymeric article is expanded in a direction (e.g., longitudinal, circumferential or other direction) while being heated at elevated temperature (e.g., at or above the Tg of the polymeric material comprising the polymeric article), and then the expanded polymeric article is cooled to a lower temperature (e.g., below Tg). The polymeric article can be longitudinally extended by any suitable method. For example, if the polymeric article is a tube, a tubular structure whose diameter is slightly less than the inner diameter of the polymeric tube can be placed inside the tube, one end of the tube can be held in place, and force can be applied to the other end of the tube to stretch the polymeric tube while maintaining the diameter of the tube relatively uniform along the length of the tube. Moreover, the polymeric article can be radially expanded by any suitable method. For example, if the polymeric article is a tube, an expandable pressure vessel can be placed inside the tube and then gas or fluid, optionally heated, can be introduced into the vessel to radially expand the polymeric tube to the desired diameter. The expandable pressure vessel can optionally have heating elements for heating the polymeric tube. An alternative method of radial expansion of the polymeric tube is blow molding. The polymeric tube can be placed inside a molding tube having an inner diameter equal to the desired expanded outer diameter of the polymeric tube. Pressurized inert gas (e.g., nitrogen or argon), optionally heated, can be introduced into the molding tube to radially expand the polymeric tube to the inner diameter of the molding tube. The molding tube can optionally have heating elements for heating the polymeric tube. In some embodiments, the polymeric article is longitudinally extended and/or radially expanded, optionally while the polymeric article is heated at elevated temperature (e.g., at or above the Tg of the polymeric material comprising the polymeric article) and optionally with cooling of the longitudinally extended and/or radially expanded polymeric article to a lower temperature (e.g., below Tg), which can increase the strength of the polymeric article and can induce or increase orientation of crystals, crystalline regions or polymer chains substantially in the longitudinal direction, the circumferential direction, and/or a biaxial direction. In certain embodiments, the polymeric article is radially expanded while being heated at elevated temperature (e.g., at or above the Tg of the polymeric material comprising the polymeric article) and then the radially expanded polymeric article is cooled to a lower temperature (e.g., below Tg), which can increase the strength of the polymeric article and can induce or increase orientation of crystals, crystalline regions or polymer chains substantially in the circumferential direction or a biaxial direction. In some embodiments, the polymeric article is longitudinally extended by at least about 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 200%, 300%, 400% or 500% of its initial length, and/or radially expanded by at least about 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 200%, 300%, 400% or 500% of its initial diameter. In certain embodiments, the polymeric article is longitudinally extended by at least about 50% of its initial length, or radially expanded by at least about 50% of its initial diameter, or both. In further embodiments, the polymeric article is longitudinally extended by at least about 100% of its initial length, or radially expanded by at least about 100% of its initial diameter, or both. Furthermore, the polymeric article can be rotated at a certain rate and for a certain period of time, optionally with heating, to induce circumferentially oriented stress, which can increase the radial strength of the polymeric article and/or impart substantially circumferential or biaxial orientation to the polymeric material comprising the polymeric article. For example, a mandrel having a polymeric tube formed on it can be rotated at a certain rate and for a certain period of time, optionally with heating. Another treatment that can, e.g., control crystallinity of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the polymeric article is exposure of the polymeric article to radiation (e.g., ionizing radiation, such as e-beam radiation or gamma radiation). Ionizing radiation can be used to control physical characteristics (e.g., control crystallinity or promote crosslinking) of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the polymeric article without necessarily sterilizing the article, or to control physical characteristics of the material and sterilize the polymeric article. In some embodiments, the polymeric article is exposed to a single dose or multiple doses of e-beam or gamma radiation at ambient temperature, or below or above ambient temperature, where a dose of radiation is at least about 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 kGray (kGy), or the total dose of radiation is about 1 or 5 kGy to about 100 kGy, or about 5 or 10 kGy to about 60 kGy, or about 10 or 20 kGy to about 50 kGy, or about 20 or 30 kGy to about 40 kGy. In certain embodiments, the polymeric article is cooled to reduced temperature (e.g., below 0° C.) and then is exposed to a single dose or multiple doses of e-beam or gamma radiation totaling about 10 kGy to about 50 kGy. The strength and/or toughness of the material(s) (e.g., polymeric material(s)] comprising the implantable device can also be enhanced by incorporation of one or more additives in the polymeric article from which the device is formed, and/or by incorporation of one or more additives in a coating on the device. As an example, one or more additives (e.g., nanotubes, carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, nanoparticles, nanospheres, nanopowders, nanoclay, zeolites, exfoliates, fibers, whiskers, platelets, monomers, polymers, etc.) can be incorporated in the polymeric article and/or a coating on the device to reinforce and strengthen the material(s), e.g., polymeric material(s), comprising the polymeric article and/or the coating. For example, fibers, particles or the like comprised of the same polymer or a different biodegradable or non-degradable polymer can be incorporated in the polymeric article and/or a coating on the device to reinforce and strengthen the material(s), e.g., polymeric material(s), comprising the polymeric article and/or the coating. In certain embodiments, the amount of each of the one or more additives (e.g., nanotubes, carbon nanotubes, fullerenes, nanoparticles, nanospheres, nanopowders, nanoclay, zeolites, exfoliates, fibers, whiskers, platelets, monomers, polymers, etc.) incorporated in the polymeric article and/or a coating on the device is about 0.1 or 0.5 wt % to about 10 wt %, or about 0.1 or 0.5 wt % to about 5 wt %, or about 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 wt %. As a further example, one or more additives, e.g., solvents (e.g., dichloromethane and dimethylsulfoxide), glucosemonoesters, citrate esters, adipate esters, epoxidized soy oil, acetyl-tri-n-butyl citrate (ATBC), buturyl-tri-n-hexyl citrate (BTHC), di-iso-nonyl 1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylate (DINCH), dioctyl terephthalate (DOTP), monomers (e.g., monomer(s) of the polymer(s) comprising the polymeric article and/or the coating), and polymers (e.g., polyethylene carbonate, polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and polydimethylsiloxane), can be incorporated in the polymeric article and/or a coating on the device to plasticize or soften the material(s), e.g., polymeric material(s) comprising the polymeric article and/or the coating and make those material(s), e.g., polymeric material(s), more ductile and/or tougher. If a solvent (e.g., dichloromethane or dimethylsulfoxide) is utilized as an additive, a controlled amount of the solvent (e.g., about 0.5 wt % to about 5 wt %, or about 1 wt % to about 3 or 4 wt %, of the solvent relative to the weight of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or a coating on the device, or relative to the weight of the device) can be incorporated in the body of the device and/or a coating on the device by, e.g., incorporating the solvent in the polymeric article and/or a coating and controlling the parameters of any treatments (e.g., heating, vacuuming and/or exposure to carbon dioxide gas or liquid) that the polymeric article and/or the device undergo. In certain embodiments, about 1.5 or 2 wt % of a solvent (e.g., dichloromethane or dimethylsulfoxide) relative to the weight of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or a coating on the device, or relative to the weight of the device, is incorporated in the body of the device and/or a coating on the device as an additive. Depending on the type of device it is, the biodegradable implantable device may be able to be formed from the polymeric article when the polymeric article is associated with the structure or removed from the structure. For example, a stent can be patterned from a polymeric tube (e.g., by laser or mechanical cutting) when the tube is either associated with a mandrel or removed from the mandrel. In certain embodiments, the polymeric article is removed from the structure prior to formation of the device from the polymeric article. The implantable device can be formed from the polymeric article using any suitable method or technique. In certain embodiments, the device is formed from the polymeric article by cutting the polymeric article with a laser to form a pattern of the device. The heat-affect zone and recasting of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the polymeric article can be minimized by employing a laser having a short pulse duration (e.g., a pulse duration in the nanoseconds or femtoseconds). Non-limiting examples of lasers that can be used to cut the polymeric article include excimer lasers and diode-pumped solid-state lasers operating at a wavelength of about 157 nm to about 351 nm, or at about 193 nm, and femtosecond lasers and ultrafast lasers operating at a wavelength of about 600 nm to about 1000 nm, or at about 800 nm. The implantable device can be any device described herein. When the device is a stent, the stent can be any stent described herein, and can have any pattern and design suitable for its intended use, including any stent pattern and design described herein. When the device is a stent, in some embodiments the stent is patterned from a polymeric tube that has a (e.g., inner) diameter substantially equal to an intended deployment (e.g., inner) diameter or the maximum allowable expansion (e.g., inner) diameter of the stent. In other embodiments, the stent is patterned from a polymeric tube that has a (e.g., inner) diameter greater than (e.g., at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% greater than) an intended deployment (nominal or labeled) (e.g., inner) diameter or the maximum allowable expansion (e.g., inner) diameter of the stent. In an embodiment, the stent is patterned from a polymeric tube that has a (e.g., inner) diameter at least about 10% greater than an intended (labeled or nominal) deployment (e.g., inner) diameter or the maximum allowable expansion (e.g., inner) diameter of the stent. In some embodiments, the stent is patterned from a polymeric tube that has a (e.g., inner) diameter of about 2 mm to about 9 mm, or about 2 mm to about 7 mm, or about 2 mm to about 5 mm, or about 2.5 mm to about 4.5 mm, or about 2.75 mm to about 4.5 mm, or about 3 mm to about 4.5 mm, or about 2.75 mm to about 4 mm, or about 3 mm to about 4 mm, or about 3.3 mm to about 3.8 mm. In certain embodiments, the stent is patterned from a polymeric tube that has a (e.g., inner) diameter of about 2.75 mm to about 4.5 mm, or about 2.75 mm to about 4 mm. In some embodiments, prior to patterning the stent from a polymeric tube, the diameter (e.g., inner diameter) of the polymeric tube is set by heating the tube at a temperature within about 10° C. or 5° C. of the Tg, or at or above the Tg, of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the tube, and optionally cooling the tube to a temperature below the Tg (e.g., at least about 5, 10, 15 or 20° C. below the Tg, or to ambient temperature or below). In some embodiments, the method of making the biodegradable implantable device comprises applying a first coating solution or mixture containing a biodegradable polymer or a non-degradable polymer, or both, and a solvent to the device to form a first coating disposed over or adjacent to at least a portion of the device. The biodegradable polymer of the first coating can be any biodegradable polymer described herein, and the non-degradable polymer of the first coating can be any non-degradable polymer described herein. In some embodiments, the biodegradable polymer of the first coating is a polylactide homopolymer or copolymer, wherein lactide includes L-lactide, D-lactide and D,L-lactide. In certain embodiments, the biodegradable polymer of the first coating is a poly(L-lactide) homopolymer or copolymer. In further embodiments, the biodegradable polymer of the first coating is a copolymer of L-lactide and glycolide in a weight or molar ratio of about 70:30 to about 99.9:0.1, or about 75:25 to about 95:5, or about 80:20 to about 90:10, or about 82:18 to about 88:12. In an embodiment, the biodegradable polymer of the first coating is a copolymer of L-lactide and glycolide in a weight or molar ratio of about 85:15. The solvent of the first coating solution or mixture can be any suitable solvent for applying a polymer as described herein. In an embodiment, the solvent is dichloromethane. In some embodiments, the concentration of the biodegradable polymer or the non-degradable polymer, or both individually or combined, in the first coating solution or mixture is about 0.1 mg/mL to about 15 mg/mL, or about 0.5 mg/mL to about 10 mg/mL, or about 0.5 mg/mL to about 5 mg/mL, or about 1 mg/mL to about 3 mg/mL. In certain embodiments, the concentration of the biodegradable polymer or the non-degradable polymer, or both individually or combined, in the first coating solution or mixture is about 1 mg/mL to about 3 mg/mL, or about 2 mg/mL. In further embodiments, the first coating solution or mixture contains one or more biologically active agents, or one or more additives, or both. The biologically active agent(s) of the first coating can be any biologically active agent described herein, and the additive(s) of the first coating can be any additive described herein. In an embodiment, the biologically active agent(s) of the first coating include myolimus or novolimus. In some embodiments, the weight percentage of the biologically active agent(s), individually or combined, relative to the amount of the biologically active agent(s) and the polymer(s) in the first coating solution or mixture is about 10% to about 60%, or about 20% to about 60%, or about 30% to about 60%, or about 30% to about 50%, or about 40% to about 50%. In certain embodiments, the weight percentage of the biologically active agent(s), individually or combined, relative to the amount of the biologically active agent(s) and the polymer(s) in the first coating solution or mixture is about 30% to about 50%, or about 40%. In additional embodiments, the method of making the device comprises applying a second coating solution or mixture containing a biodegradable polymer or a non-degradable polymer, or both, and a solvent to the device to form a second coating disposed over or adjacent to at least a portion of the first coating. The second coating solution or mixture can contain one or more biologically active agents, or one or more additives, or both. The method can also comprise applying one or more additional coatings to the device. The biodegradable polymer, the non-degradable polymer, the biologically active agent(s) and the additive(s) of the second coating and any additional coating(s) can independently be any biodegradable polymer described herein, any non-degradable polymer described herein, any biologically active agent described herein, and any additive described herein. The first coating and any additional coating(s) can be applied to the implantable device using any suitable method, e.g., by spraying the respective coating solution or mixture onto the device or dipping the device in the respective coating solution or mixture. The coated device can be treated to incorporate or remove any residual water, solvent(s), monomer(s), low molecular weight oligomer(s) and/or particulate(s) from the coating(s) or the device. In some embodiments, the coated device is subjected to reduced or elevated pressure or heated at elevated temperature (e.g., at least about 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 or 100° C.), or both, for a period of time (e.g., at least about 0.5, 1, 6, 12, 24, 36 or 48 hours). The coated device can also be treated to stabilize the coating(s) and prevent their smearing (e.g., upon expansion of the device). In some embodiments, the coated device is heated at about 50° C., 60° C., 70° C., 80° C., 90° C. or 100° C. or above, at ambient pressure or under reduced pressure, for a period of time (e.g., at least about 10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr or 12 hr). In certain embodiments, the coated device is heated at about 60° C. or above, at ambient pressure or under reduced pressure, for at least about 10 min To minimize degradation of any biologically active agent(s) present in a coating or in the body of the device, the coated device can be heated in an inert environment (e.g., under nitrogen, argon or other inert gas). In some embodiments, after the coated device undergoes any vacuum and/or heat treatments, the thickness (e.g., average thickness) of each of the first coating and any additional coating(s) independently is about 20 microns or less, or about 15 microns or less, or about 10 microns or less, or about 5 microns or less, or about 4 microns or less, or about 3 microns or less, or about 2 microns or less, or about 1 micron or less. In certain embodiments, after the coated device undergoes any vacuum and/or heat treatments, the thickness (e.g., average thickness) of each of the first coating and any additional coating(s) independently is about 10 microns or less, or about 5 microns or less. In further embodiments, after the coated device undergoes any vacuum and/or heat treatments, the thickness (e.g., average thickness) of the first coating is about 5 microns or less, or about 3 microns or less. As described herein, the body of the implantable device can comprise features in and/or on the body, and/or a coating on the device can comprise features in and/or on the coating, that promote degradation of the body and/or the coating. Examples of degradation-promoting features include without limitation openings, pores (including partial pores and through pores), holes (including partial holes and through holes), recesses, pits, cavities, trenches, reservoirs and channels. Such degradation-promoting features can be formed by any of a variety of ways. For example, incorporation of an additive in the polymeric article and/or a coating on the device and subsequent removal of the additive by exposure of the polymeric article and/or the device to a solvent that dissolves the additive but does not substantially dissolve the polymer(s) comprising the polymeric article and/or the coating can form pores in and/or on the body and/or the coating of the device. As another example, incorporation of an additive (e.g., a blowing agent, a gas, a solvent or water) in the polymeric article and/or a coating on the device and subsequent removal of the additive by exposure of the polymeric article and/or the device to heat and/or reduced pressure can form pores in and/or on the body and/or the coating of the device. As still another example, incorporation of an additive (e.g., a substance having a relatively low molecular weight of about 2,000 daltons or less) in the polymeric article and/or a coating on the device and subsequent removal of the additive by exposure of the polymeric article and/or the device to carbon dioxide gas or liquid under elevated pressure, optionally under a flow of carbon dioxide, can form pores in and/or on the body and/or the coating of the device. As yet another example, an additive (e.g., a blowing agent) incorporated in the polymeric article and/or a coating on the device can leach out from the polymeric article, the body of the device and/or the coating before and/or after the device is implanted in a subject to form pores in and/or on the body and/or the coating of the device. As a further example, a certain amount of an additive (e.g., about 4-10 wt %, or about 5 wt %, of carbon nanotubes) can be incorporated in the polymeric article and/or a coating on the device to form pores in and/or on the body and/or the coating of the device. After a device is formed from the polymeric article, the device can undergo any of a variety of treatments designed, e.g., to control or reduce residual or internal stress in the device and/or to control crystallinity and/or control or enhance the strength or toughness of the material(s), e.g., polymeric material(s), comprising the body of the device and/or a coating on the device. In some embodiments, the device undergoes one or more cycles of heating and cooling to anneal the material(s), e.g., polymeric material(s). In certain embodiments, the device is heated at a temperature equal to or greater than the Tg of the first biodegradable polymer or the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device for a period of time (e.g., at least about 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 4, 8, 12 or 24 hours), and then quickly or slowly cooled to a lower temperature (e.g., at least about 10° C., 20° C., 30° C., 40° C. or 50° C. below the Tg, or to ambient temperature or below) over a period of time (e.g., about 10 sec, 30 sec, 1 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr or 12 hr). In further embodiments, the device is heated at a temperature above the Tg and below the Tm of the first biodegradable polymer or the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device for a period of time (e.g., at least about 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 4, 8, 12 or 24 hours), and then quickly or slowly cooled to a lower temperature (e.g., at least about 10° C., 20° C., 30° C., 40° C. or 50° C. below the Tg, or to ambient temperature or below) over a period of time (e.g., about 10 sec, 30 sec, 1 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr or 12 hr). In certain embodiments, the device is heated at a temperature within the cold crystallization temperature range of the first biodegradable polymer or the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device for a period of time (e.g., at least about 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 4, 8, 12 or 24 hours), and then quickly or slowly cooled to a lower temperature (e.g., at least about 10° C., 20° C., 30° C., 40° C. or 50° C. below the Tg, or to ambient temperature or below) over a period of time (e.g., about 10 sec, 30 sec, 1 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr or 12 hr). In still further embodiments, the device is heated at a temperature equal to or greater than the Tm of the first biodegradable polymer or the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device for a period of time (e.g., at least about 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 4, 8, 12 or 24 hours) to melt crystalline regions of the first biodegradable polymer or the material (e.g., polymeric material), and then quickly or slowly cooled to a lower temperature (e.g., at least about 10° C., 20° C., 30° C., 40° C. or 50° C. below the Tg, or to ambient temperature or below) over a period of time (e.g., about 10 sec, 30 sec, 1 min, 10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr or 12 hr). Another treatment that can, e.g., control crystallinity of the material(s), e.g., polymeric material(s) comprising the body of the device and/or a coating on the device is exposure of the device to radiation (e.g., ionizing radiation, such as e-beam radiation or gamma radiation). Ionizing radiation can be used to control physical characteristics (e.g., control crystallinity or promote crosslinking) of the material(s), e.g., polymeric material(s), comprising the body of the device and/or a coating on the device without necessarily sterilizing the device, or to control physical characteristics of the material(s) and sterilize the device. In some embodiments, the device is exposed to a single dose or multiple doses of e-beam or gamma radiation at ambient temperature, or below or above ambient temperature, where a dose of radiation is at least about 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 kGy, or the total dose of radiation is about 1 or 5 kGy to about 100 kGy, or about 5 or 10 kGy to about 60 kGy, or about 10 or 20 kGy to about 50 kGy, or about 20 or 30 kGy to about 40 kGy. In certain embodiments, the device is cooled to reduced temperature (e.g., below 0° C.) and then is exposed to a single dose or multiple doses of e-beam or gamma radiation totaling about 10 kGy to about 50 kGy, or about 30 kGy. Furthermore, the device can be rotated at a certain rate and for a certain period of time, optionally with heating, to induce circumferentially oriented stress, which can increase the radial strength of the device and/or impart substantially circumferential or biaxial orientation to the polymeric material comprising the body of the device. For example, a mandrel having a stent associated with it can be rotated at a certain rate and for a certain period of time, optionally with heating. When the implantable device is a stent, the stent can be crimped to a reduced diameter so that the stent can be delivered through a vessel or passage of a subject. In some embodiments, the stent is crimped to an inner diameter of about 0.4 mm, 1 mm to about 2 mm, or about 1.2 mm to about 1.6 mm, or about 1.3 mm to about 1.5 mm. In certain embodiments, the stent is crimped to an inner diameter of about 1.3 mm to about 1.5 mm, or about 1.4 mm. In some embodiments, the stent is crimped at ambient temperature, or is crimped at a temperature (crimping temperature) of at least about 30° C., 35° C., 40° C., 45° C. or 50° C., and the stent crimped at elevated temperature is then cooled to a lower temperature (e.g., at least about 5° C., 10° C., 15° C., 20° C., 25° C. or 30° C. below the crimping temperature, or to ambient temperature or below). In certain embodiments, the stent is crimped at about 40° C. or above, and the crimped stent is then cooled to a temperature at least about 5° C. below the crimping temperature. Radially inward recoil of the stent after it is deployed can be reduced by crimping the stent at a temperature at about the Tg or below the Tg of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the stent body. In certain embodiments, the stent is crimped at an elevated temperature that is at about the Tg or at least about 1° C., 5° C., 10° C., 15° C., 20° C., 25° C., 30° C., 35° C., 40° C., 45° C. or 50° C. below the Tg of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the stent body. In an embodiment, the stent is crimped at an elevated temperature that is at least about 5° C. below the Tg of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the stent body. Furthermore, the conditions in which the crimped stent is treated and handled can affect cracking, recoil, radial strength and uniformity of radial expansion of the stent. Minimizing exposure of the crimped stent to heat (in terms of, e.g., temperature and exposure time) can decrease cracking and recoil and improve radial strength and uniformity of radial expansion. Heat may promote generation of a crimped-state memory and may promote erasure of some amount of the as-cut tube memory (the diameter of the tube used to pattern the stent). For example, cracking and recoil can be decreased and radial strength and uniformity of radial expansion can be improved by exposing the crimped stent to a temperature not exceeding the Tg, or at least about 1° C., 5° C., 10° C., 15° C., 20° C., 25° C. or 30° C. below the Tg, of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the stent body during, e.g., stabilization of the stent in the crimped state, mounting of the crimped stent onto a balloon-catheter, sterilization of the stent delivery system (e.g., with e-beam), and storage. During storage of a crimped stent, the presence of heat (whether added or not) may induce crystallization of the polymeric material comprising the stent body over time. Crystallization of the polymeric material may or may not be accompanied by increase in the glass transition temperature of the polymeric material, and may render the polymeric material more brittle. Greater brittleness of the polymeric material may increase cracking of crowns of the stent upon radial expansion of the stent. Crystallization of the polymeric material during storage may also strengthen the crimped-state memory and may weaken the as-cut tube memory of the stent, which may result in less uniform radial expansion of the stent and greater radially inward recoil of the stent after expansion. Crystallization of the polymeric material comprising the body of the crimped stent during storage can be reduced by any of a variety of ways. As a non-limiting example, the stent body can be comprised of a polymeric material that does not crystallize or increase in crystallinity over time and/or in the presence of heat (whether added or not). For example, the stent polymeric material can already be at its maximum % crystallinity prior to storage of the crimped stent, provided that the polymeric material is not too brittle and is sufficiently tough. As another example, one or more crystallization-inhibiting additives can be incorporated in the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the stent body. In certain embodiments, the crystallization-inhibiting additive(s) leach out from the stent material after exposure of the stent to physiological conditions. As yet another example, the crimped stent (or stent delivery system) can be stored at reduced temperature (e.g., at about 10° C., 5° C., 0° C., −5° C., −10° C. or −20° C. or below). Or the stent can be formed from a polymeric tube comprised of a polymeric material that has a low % crystallinity, so that any increase in crystallinity of the polymeric material during storage of the crimped stent does not result in a final % crystallinity that may adversely affect physical properties of the stent. In some embodiments, prior to sterilization the crimped stent is stabilized in the crimped state at about 20° C. to about 35° C., or at about 25° C. to about 30° C., or at about 30° C., or at about 30° C. to about 35° C., or at about 35° C. to about 45° C.; for at least about 0.1 hr, 1 hr, 2 hr, 3 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr, 12 hr, 16 hr or 24 hr, or longer. The crimped stent can be mounted onto a balloon-catheter to provide a stent delivery system. In certain embodiments, after sterilization (e.g., with e-beam) the crimped stent, or the stent mounted on a balloon-catheter, is stabilized in the crimped state at about 20° C. to about the Tg of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the stent, or at about 5° C., 10° C., 15° C., 20° C., 25° C. or 30° C. below the Tg, or at about 20° C. to about 30° C., or at about 25° C., or at about 30° C. to about 35° C., or at about 35° C. to about 45° C.; for at least about 0.1 hr, 1 hr, 4 hr, 6 hr, 12 hr, 24 hr, 36 hr, 48 hr, 60 hr, 72 hr, 84 hr or 96 hr, or longer. Stabilization of the mounted stent in the crimped state can enhance or control its retention on the balloon or delivery system during delivery through a vessel or a passage in a subject or upon expansion inside a blood vessel. Retention of a stent on a balloon-catheter can also be enhanced by forming the inner (luminal) layer of the stent body from, or coating the luminal surface of the stent with, an elastomeric polymeric material, e.g., poly(ε-caprolactone), with a relatively high coefficient of friction. The relatively high-friction polymeric material can minimize movement of the stent on the balloon. Additional ways for improving retention of a stent on a balloon-catheter include use of a non-permanent adhesive applied to the balloon or the luminal surface of the stent, or both. In some embodiments, the adhesive is made from a hydrophobic material that can resist water and lose its tackiness when exposed to water. In certain embodiments, the adhesive has weak bond force in the shear direction. Raised portions (poofs) formed on the balloon of a balloon-catheter and located at the proximal and distal ends of a stent can maintain the stent on the balloon. Poofs located above the balloon markers of the catheter can be formed on the balloon (see, e.g., Example 1). For example, the balloon poofs can be designed to cap the proximal and distal ends of the stent (FIG. 2). Furthermore, the abluminal surface, the luminal surface and both side surfaces of a crimped stent can be partially or fully covered by a water-soluble or non soluble material that dissolves away after a certain period of time. Coverage of the stent by the water-soluble or non soluble material reduces permeation of water into the body of the stent, which prevents the stent from growing or swelling above the balloon poofs, thereby helping to retain the stent on the balloon. Cap(s) can be placed on the proximal end and/or the distal end of a crimped stent to maintain the stent on a balloon-catheter. A major portion of the cap can be on the balloon-catheter, and a minor portion of the cap can be extended over the stent. In certain embodiments, the cap covers at most one full crown of the stent, or at most half a crown. The cap can be fitted tightly against the balloon portion of the catheter or be bonded to the catheter. Prior to radial expansion of the stent, the cap maintains the stent on the balloon-catheter. During radial expansion of the stent, the cap recesses, allowing the stent to expand without hindrance. The cap can be solid and be substantially free of holes, or can be a mesh or have holes. Moreover, a stent can have locks or lockable elements that help to retain the stent on a balloon-catheter. FIG. 3 illustrates a non-limiting example of a stent pattern having lockable elements. When the stent is crimped, the arrow or male on one side of a lockable element engages with the other side or female of an adjacent lockable element and locks in place. Locking of the lockable elements prevents the stent from growing, thereby helping to retain the stent on the balloon. A crimped stent can also be maintained on a balloon-catheter by placing a retractable sheath or sleeve over the stent. The sheath or sleeve can end at or beyond the proximal end and/or the distal end of the stent, or over the stent. The sheath or sleeve can be physically or mechanically retracted from the stent prior to radial expansion of the stent. In addition, a stent can be retained on a balloon by placing or crimping a protector stent over the main stent. In certain embodiments, the protector stent is thin (e.g., about 0.001 inch thick) and has a relatively high degree of crystallinity or a relatively high Tg. The protector stent may not grow when exposed to physiological conditions, may not expand evenly or may crack, but the main stent is the stent that is designed to expand substantially evenly and support the treated vessel. In some embodiments, the biodegradable stent is retained on a balloon-catheter by any suitable means, including any means described herein, and is configured not to move on the balloon-catheter in at least one longitudinal direction by more than about 5 mm, 4 mm, 3 mm, 2 mm, 1 mm or 0.5 mm, e.g., during delivery of the stent-catheter system through a vessel or passage of a subject. In an embodiment, the stent is configured not to move on the balloon-catheter in at least one longitudinal direction by more than about 1 mm. The device (e.g., a crimped or uncrimped stent or a stent delivery system) can be subjected to a sterilization condition. Subjecting the device to a sterilization condition can serve purposes in addition to sterilization of the device, such as controlling crystallinity of the material(s), e.g., polymeric material(s), comprising the device. Non-limiting examples of sterilization conditions include radiation, ionizing radiation, e-beam radiation, gamma radiation, and ethylene oxide gas. In some embodiments, the device is exposed to a single dose or multiple doses of e-beam or gamma radiation at ambient temperature, or below or above ambient temperature, where a dose of radiation is at least about 0.1, 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 kGray (kGy), or the total dose of radiation is about 1 or 5 kGy to about 100 kGy, or about 5 or 10 kGy to about 60 kGy, or about 10 or 20 kGy to about 50 kGy, or about 20 or 30 kGy to about 40 kGy. For sterilization the device (e.g., a crimped or uncrimped stent or a stent delivery system) can also be exposed to ethylene oxide gas in a suitable environment (e.g., a sealed bag or a chamber). As a non-limiting example of sterilization with ethylene oxide gas, the device is preconditioned for about 1 hr at a relative humidity of at least about 35% and at a temperature of about ambient temperature to about 33° C. The device is exposed to ethylene oxide gas at a temperature of about ambient temperature to about 33° C., or at about 25° C., or between about 20° C. to about 40° C.; for at least about 4 hr, 8 hr, 12 hr, 16 hr, 24 hr or 30 hr. Sterilization can be conducted in the presence of water chips (e.g., two 4 g water chips) to increase humidity. As another example of sterilization with ethylene oxide gas, the device is exposed to ethylene oxide gas at a temperature of about 35° C. to about 50° C., or about 35° C. to about 45° C., and at a relative humidity of about 20% to about 80%, or about 30% to about 70%, for at least about 4 hr, 8 hr, 12 hr, 16 hr or 24 hr. To avoid generation of a crimped-state memory at higher temperature, a stent can be mounted onto an inflated balloon prior to sterilization, sterilized with ethylene oxide gas at elevated temperature, and then crimped onto the deflated balloon in an aseptic or semi-aseptic environment. The stent-balloon-catheter delivery system can be terminally sterilized by exposure to nitrogen dioxide at about ambient temperature or below for at least about 10, 30, 60, 90 or 120 minutes, using, e.g., a system developed by Noxilizer (Baltimore, Md.). In addition to spraying, the biodegradable implantable devices such as the stent (scaffold) described herein can be made by other suitable methods, such as dipping, extrusion, molding, injection molding, compression molding and 3-D printing. For example, a polymeric article/material (e.g., a polymeric tube) can be made by dipping a structure (e.g., a substantially cylindrical structure) in a solution or mixture containing one or more biodegradable polymers and a solvent, and optionally one or more non-degradable polymers, one or more biologically active agents, and one or more additives. A device (e.g., a stent) can be formed from the polymeric article (e.g., by laser or mechanical cutting) while the article is associated with the structure or after the article is removed from the structure. A polymeric article made by dipping, and/or a device formed from such a polymeric article, can undergo any one or more of the processing steps and treatments described herein (e.g., longitudinal extension, radial expansion, heating, pressurizing, vacuuming, or exposure to radiation or carbon dioxide, or a combination thereof). Dipping can also be performed to make a polymeric article (e.g., a polymeric tube) comprising two or more polymer layers, where each layer independently contains one or more biodegradable polymers, and optionally one or more non-degradable polymers, one or more biologically active agents, and one or more additives. After a structure (e.g., a substantially cylindrical structure) is dipped in and then removed from a first solution or mixture containing one or more biodegradable polymers and optional additional material(s) or substance(s), the coated structure is suitably dried by any of various treatments described herein (e.g., vacuuming, heating, and/or exposure to carbon dioxide gas or liquid). The coated structure is dipped in and then removed from a second solution or mixture containing one or more biodegradable polymers and optional additional material(s) or substance(s), and is suitably dried to form a second polymer layer of the polymeric article. The dipping and drying process can be repeated a desired number of times to form a desired number of polymer layers of the polymeric article. Moreover, a polymeric article (e.g., a polymeric tube) comprising one or more polymer layers and one or more metal layers can be made by dipping. For example, a metal film, foil or tube comprising a corrodible metal or metal alloy, and optionally a non-corrodible metal or metal alloy, can be applied to a coated structure made by dipping the structure (e.g., a substantially cylindrical structure) in a first solution or mixture containing one or more biodegradable polymers, and optionally one or more non-degradable polymers, one or more biologically active agents, and one or more additives. The metal film, foil or tube can be pre-textured or pre-treated (e.g., by microblasting) prior to its application to form surface roughness on one side of the metal film, foil or tube to enhance its adhesion to the first polymer layer. A second polymer layer can be applied to the metal layer, the other side of the metal film, foil or tube can be pre-textured or pre-treated, or can be treated after its application to the first polymer layer, to form surface roughness on the uncoated side of the metal layer before the structure is dipped in a second solution or mixture containing one or more biodegradable polymers and optional additional material(s) or substance(s). The following provides embodiments of ways for making a polymeric tube by dipping. A mandrel, whose diameter can be substantially equal to or larger than an intended deployment inner diameter of a stent to be formed from the tube, is dipped in a solution or mixture containing one or more biodegradable polymers and a solvent, and optionally one or more non-degradable polymers, one or more biologically active agents, and one or more additives. The concentration of the material(s) in the solution or mixture can be about 1 or 5 mg/mL to about 100 mg/mL, or about 10 or 20 mg/mL to about 50 mg/mL. The mandrel can be dipped in the polymer solution or mixture with or without rotation of the mandrel. After the mandrel is dipped in the polymer solution or mixture for a period of time (e.g., at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or 15 seconds), the mandrel is removed from the polymer solution or mixture at a certain rate that may depend on the desired thickness of the coating/layer or tube (if the tube contains only one polymer layer). More than one cycle of dipping and removal can be performed depending on, e.g., the concentration of the polymer solution or mixture and the desired thickness of the coating/layer or tube. After removal of the mandrel from the polymer solution or mixture, the coated mandrel can be rotated (e.g., held and rotated in a horizontal position) or not rotated. The coated mandrel can undergo vacuuming and/or heating to remove, e.g., any residual solvent(s) and monomer(s). The coated mandrel can also be exposed to carbon dioxide gas or liquid under elevated pressure to remove, e.g., any residual solvent(s), monomer(s), low molecular weight oligomer(s) and/or particulate(s). The thickness and physical characteristics of the coating/layer or tube can be controlled by controlling various parameters, such as the composition and concentration of the polymer solution or mixture, the number of times the mandrel is dipped in the polymer solution or mixture, the duration of each dip, the rate of removal of the mandrel from the polymer solution or mixture, and the conditions and duration of drying after each dip. If the polymeric tube is to comprise a second polymer layer, the suitably dried coated mandrel is dipped in a second solution or mixture containing one or more biodegradable polymers and a solvent, and optionally one or more non-degradable polymers, one or more biologically active agents, and one or more additives. A stent can be patterned from the polymeric tube by, e.g., laser or mechanical cutting while the tube remains on the mandrel or after the tube is removed from the mandrel. Dipping can provide a polymeric tube comprised of a polymeric material that is, or has crystals, crystalline regions or polymer chains that are, substantially randomly oriented or substantially not uniaxially oriented, circumferentially oriented, longitudinally oriented or biaxially oriented, if desired. To promote formation of a polymeric tube comprised of a polymeric material that is substantially not uniaxially oriented or biaxially oriented, certain parameters of the dipping process can be controlled, such as the concentration of the polymer solution or mixture, the rate and direction of dipping (e.g., the length of the mandrel is dipped in the polymer solution or mixture horizontally, vertically or at an angle), the rate of rotation, if any, of the mandrel while dipped in the polymer solution or mixture, the rate of removal of the mandrel from the polymer solution or mixture, and the rate of rotation, if any, of the coated mandrel after removal from the polymer solution or mixture. Extrusion is another non-limiting example of a method for making biodegradable implantable devices described herein. For example, one or more biodegradable polymers, and optionally one or more non-degradable polymers, one or more additives, and one or more biologically active agents [if the heating is compatible with the bioactive agent(s)], can be heated and drawn through a die to make a polymeric article (e.g., a polymeric tube). A device (e.g., a stent) can be formed from the polymeric article using any suitable method (e.g., laser or mechanical cutting). To make a polymeric tube comprising two or more polymer layers, two or more tubings can be co-drawn, where each tubing independently contains one or more biodegradable polymers, and optionally one or more non-degradable polymers, one or more additives, and one or more biologically active agents. Drawing the extruded material in a particular direction, optionally at elevated temperature, may induce or increase orientation of the material, or its crystals, crystalline regions or polymer chains, substantially in that direction. If desired, the following provides embodiments of ways for making a polymeric article (e.g., a polymeric tube) by extrusion, where the article is comprised of a polymeric material that is, or has crystals, crystalline regions or polymer chains that are, substantially randomly oriented or substantially not uniaxially oriented, circumferentially oriented, longitudinally oriented or biaxially oriented. As a first embodiment, a polymeric material is extruded at elevated temperature in the presence of a crystallization inhibitor that inhibits crystallization of the polymeric material while the material cools down after it exits the hot extruder nozzle. As a second embodiment, a polymeric material is extruded at elevated temperature. Immediately after the polymeric material exits the hot extruder nozzle, the polymeric material is rapidly cooled below its crystallization temperature (Tc) or glass transition temperature (Tg), or to ambient temperature or below, to prevent or minimize crystallization of the polymeric material. The resulting polymeric article (e.g., polymeric tube) can be formed into a device (e.g., a stent). As a third embodiment, a polymeric material is extruded at elevated temperature with a minimal drawing ratio. The resulting polymeric article (e.g., polymeric tube) is heated to about or above the melting temperature (Tm) of the polymeric material comprising the article. The polymeric material is rapidly cooled below its Tc or Tg, or to ambient temperature or below, to prevent or minimize crystallization of the polymeric material. The resulting polymeric article can be formed into a device (e.g., a stent). One embodiment is a process for making a biodegradable polymeric stent (or other endoprosthesis having a tubular body) according to the present teachings. A tubular body (e.g., a tube) comprised of a biodegradable polymeric material (having a degree of crystallinity of about 30%, 20%, 15%, 10% or 5% or less) is made by any suitable method, such as spraying, dipping, extrusion, molding, injection molding, compression molding or 3-D printing, e.g., by spraying onto a mandrel. The polymeric tube undergoes one or more cycles of heating and cooling (or step-wise heating and then cooling) as described herein, e.g., to increase crystallinity and/or strength of the material (e.g., polymeric material) the tube, and/or to reduce residual or internal stress in the polymeric tube. After the one or more cycles of heating and cooling or radiation, the degree of crystallinity of the material (e.g., polymeric material) is about 2%, 5% or 10% to about 70%, or about 2%, 5% or 10% to about 60%, or about 2%, 5% or 10% to about 50%, or about 2%, 5% or 10% to about 40%, or about 2%, 5% or 10% to about 30%, or about 2%, 5% or 10% to about 20%, or increases by at least about 10%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 75%, 100%, 150%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%, 600%, 700%, 800%, 900% or 1000%. The heat-treated or radiated polymeric tube is patterned into a stent or other endoprosthesis having a tubular body using any suitable method (e.g., laser or mechanical cutting). Alternatively, a stent or other endoprosthesis can be patterned from a polymeric tube that has not undergone a heat treatment, and the stent or other endoprosthesis can undergo one or more cycles of heating and cooling. As a further alternative, both the polymeric tube and the stent or other endoprosthesis can each undergo one or more cycles of heating and cooling. Residual or internal stress may arise during processing of a polymeric article (e.g., a polymeric tube) or a device (e.g., a stent) formed from the polymeric article. Residual/internal stress may cause failure (e.g., substantial shortening, shrinkage, warping or the like) of the device if the level of residual/internal stress is high enough to overcome the structural integrity of the device. A polymeric article (e.g., a polymeric tube) made by extrusion or molding or spraying may require stabilization (which can include heating and pre-shrinkage) to relieve residual/internal stress and minimize shortening, shrinkage, warping or the like. Preparation of a polymeric article (e.g., a polymeric tube) by spraying can decrease the level of residual/internal stress in the article without resorting to stabilization. Further embodiments of the disclosure relate to a method of making a biodegradable endoprosthesis, comprising providing a polymeric article (e.g., a tubular body, such as a polymeric tube) composed at least partially of a substantially amorphous or semi-crystalline, biodegradable polymeric material, wherein crystallinity (e.g., degree of crystallinity) of the polymeric material increases after the polymeric article undergoes a modification (or treatment), and wherein the endoprosthesis is formed from the polymeric article. The polymeric material is substantially amorphous or semi crystalline or crystalline prior to the modification, and may or may not be substantially amorphous after the modification. Further embodiments of the disclosure relate to a method of making a biodegradable endoprosthesis, comprising providing a polymeric article (e.g., a tubular body, such as a polymeric tube) comprising at least partially of a substantially amorphous or semi-crystalline biodegradable polymeric material, wherein crystallinity (e.g., degree of crystallinity) of the polymeric material decreases after the polymeric material undergoes a treatment, and wherein the endoprosthesis is formed substantially from the polymeric material. In one embodiment, the polymeric material is substantially amorphous or semi crystalline or crystalline prior to the modification, and substantially amorphous after the modification. In certain embodiments, the modification comprises heating, cooling, quenching, pressurizing, vacuuming, crosslinking, addition of an additive, or exposure to radiation or carbon dioxide, or a combination thereof. The polymeric article can have any shape, form and dimensions suitable for making the endoprosthesis (e.g., a patterned polymeric tube stent). In some embodiments, a biodegradable endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) is formed from a polymeric tube, wherein the tube is a substantially continuous cylinder that is substantially free from holes, gaps, voids or other discontinuities. In some embodiments, the polymeric tube has an outside diameter of about 2 mm to about 10 mm, or about 2 mm to about 5 mm; a thickness of about 0.01 mm to about 0.5 mm, or about 0.05 mm to about 0.3 mm; and a length of about 2 or 5 mm to about 20, 30, 40 or 80 mm. In certain embodiments, the polymeric tube has an outside diameter of about 2 mm to about 5 mm, a thickness of about 0.05 mm to about 0.3 mm, and a length of about 5 mm to about 30 mm. In certain embodiments, an endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) is patterned by laser cutting or other method from a polymeric tube that has a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter substantially equal to or smaller than an intended deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of the endoprosthesis. In other embodiments, an endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) is patterned from a polymeric tube that has a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter, either when the tube is formed or after the tube is radially expanded to a second larger diameter, larger than an intended deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of the endoprosthesis. Patterning a stent from a polymeric tube having a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter larger than an intended deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of the stent can impart advantageous characteristics to the stent, such as reducing radially inward recoil of the stent after deployment. In certain embodiments, a stent is patterned from a polymeric tube having a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter about 0.85, 0.90, 1.0, 1.05 to about 1.5 times, or about 1.1 to about 1.5 times, or about 1.1 to about 1.3 times, or about 1.15 to about 1.25 times, smaller, same, or larger than an intended deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of the stent. In an embodiment, the stent is patterned from a polymeric tube having a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter about 1.1 to about 1.3 times larger than an intended deployed (e.g., inner) diameter of the stent. For example, a stent having a deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of about 2.5, 3 or 3.5 mm can be patterned from a tube having a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of about 2.75, 3.3 or 3.85 mm (1.1 times larger), or about 3.25, 3.9 or 4.55 mm (1.3 times larger), or some other (e.g., inner or outer) diameter larger than the deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of the stent. In other embodiments, the initial diameter of the formed tube is larger than the crimped diameter (e.g., crimped diameter on a delivery system) of the stent prosthesis wherein the tubular body is expanded to a second larger diameter than the initial diameter before patterning or before crimping to the crimped diameter; or wherein the tubular body remains substantially the same diameter before patterning or before crimping to a crimped diameter; or wherein the tubular body is crimped to a smaller diameter than the initial formed diameter before patterning or after patterning. In another embodiment, the initial diameter of the formed tube is smaller than the crimped diameter of the stent prosthesis wherein the tubular body is expanded to a second larger diameter than the initial diameter before patterning or before crimping; or wherein the tubular body remains substantially the same diameter before patterning or before crimping; or wherein the tubular body is crimped to a smaller diameter than the crimped diameter of the stent prosthesis before patterning or after patterning. In another embodiment, the initial diameter of the formed tubular body is greater than 0.015 inches, or greater than 0.050 inches, or greater than 0.092 inches, or greater than 0.120 inches, or greater than 0.150 inches. Stent prosthesis intended deployment diameter is the diameter of the labeled delivery system or balloon catheter. For example when a stent prosthesis is crimped onto a balloon labeled 3.0 mm diameter, the stent prosthesis' intended deployment diameter is 3.0 mm. Similarly, self expandable stent crimped onto a delivery system is labeled a certain deployment diameter. The stent cut from a polymeric tube can be any kind of stent and can have any pattern and design suitable for its intended use, including any kind of stent and any pattern and design described herein. Further, the stent can be a fully self-expandable stent, a balloon-expandable stent, or a stent capable of radially self-expanding prior to balloon expansion to an intended deployed diameter. The degree of crystallinity of the material (e.g., polymeric material) of which an endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) is comprised may decline as a result of cutting of the polymeric article (e.g., a polymeric tube). In some embodiments, a stent is annealed and quenched one or more times after cutting of the polymeric tube, as described herein for annealing and quenching a polymeric article or tube, to increase the degree of crystallinity of the polymeric material (and/or reduce residual/internal stress in the polymeric material or the stent). In certain embodiments, a heat-treated stent is cooled to a temperature below ambient temperature for a period of about 1 minute to about 96 hours, or about 24 hours to about 72 hours, or about 30 minutes to about 48 hours, or about 1 hour to about 48 hours, or about 1 hour to about 36 hours, or about 1 hour to about 24 hours, or about 1 hour to about 12 hours, or about 4 hours to about 12 hours, to stabilize the stent, and/or stabilize the crystals and/or terminate crystallization in the polymeric material. In further embodiments, an unannealed or annealed stent is exposed to ionizing radiation (e.g., e-beam or gamma radiation) at, above or below ambient temperature, with a single dose or multiple doses of radiation totaling about 5 kGy to about 100 kGy, or about 10 kGy to about 50 kGy, or about 10 kGy to about 30 kGy, or about 20 kGy to about 60 kGy, or about 20 kGy to about 40 kGy. In certain embodiments, an unannealed or annealed stent is cooled to reduced temperature (e.g., below 0° C.) and then is exposed to a single dose or multiple doses of ionizing radiation (e.g., e-beam or gamma radiation) totaling about 10 kGy to about 50 kGy, or about 30 kGy. The body of the device can be formed from a polymeric material made by any suitable method, such as spraying, dipping, extrusion, molding, injection molding, compression molding, or three-dimensional (3-D) printing, or a combination thereof. In certain embodiments, the body of the device is formed from a polymeric article made by spraying a solution or mixture containing at least the biodegradable copolymer or polymer and at least one solvent onto a structure. When the device is a stent, a stent can be laser-cut from a polymeric tube made by spraying the polymer solution or mixture onto a mandrel. In another embodiment, the polymeric material or tubular body comprising the biodegradable polymer is patterned into a stent using (3-D) printing or laser cut. In another embodiment, the polymeric material or tubular body comprising the biodegradable polymer is formed using extrusion or spraying or dipping, or molding, and is patterned into a stent. In certain embodiments, the stent or body of the device comprises one or more additional polymer layers, and/or one or more metal or metal alloy layers, the additional polymer layer(s) of the polymeric material can be formed by spraying additional solution(s) or mixture(s) containing a biodegradable polymer, and/or the metal layer(s) can be formed by applying metal film(s), foil(s) or tube(s). In some embodiments, a polymer solution or mixture can contain one or more additional biodegradable polymers and/or one or more non-degradable polymers, and can also contain one or more biologically active agents and/or one or more additives. In another embodiment, the stent or tubular body comprises radiopaque markers. Radiopaque markers can be metallic such as gold, platinum, iridium, bismuth, or combination thereof, or alloys thereof. Radiopaque markers can also be polymeric material. Radiopaque markers can be incorporated in the stent or tubular body when it is being formed or incorporated into the stent or the tubular body after forming. In some embodiments, the tubular body or polymeric material or stent may be formed from at least one polymer having desired degradation characteristics where the polymer may be modified to have the desired crystallinity, Tg, recoil, strength, shortening, expansion characteristics, crimping characteristics, crystallinity, Tg, molecular weight, and/or other characteristics in accordance with the methods of the present invention.

Examples include treating the tubular body by heating the tubular body after forming to temperature at about Tg or lower than Tg or within 10° C. higher than Tg, of the biodegradable polymeric material Tg, for duration ranging from a fraction of a second to 7 days, or 5 seconds to 7 days, preferably from 15 seconds to 1 day, more preferably from 30 seconds to 5 hours, and optionally cooling or quenching after heating to above ambient, ambient temperatures or below ambient. The heating can take place once or more than once at various stages of the tubular body or stent prosthesis fabrication. In one embodiment, the biodegradable stent prosthesis comprising a tubular body comprising a biodegradable polymeric material, wherein the tubular body has been formed using extrusion, molding, dipping, or spraying and has been treated by heating the tubular body at about Tg or lower of the biodegradable polymeric material Tg, said biodegradable polymeric material is substantially amorphous after said treatment and has a Tg greater than 37° C., and the stent prosthesis at body temperature is radially expandable and has sufficient strength to support a body lumen. In another embodiment, the biodegradable stent prosthesis comprising a tubular body comprising a biodegradable polymeric material, wherein the tubular body has been formed using extrusion, molding, dipping, or spraying and has been treated by heating the tubular body at about Tg or lower of the biodegradable polymeric material Tg, said biodegradable polymeric material has crystallinity of 10%-60% (or 10%-50% or 10%-40% or 10% to 30% or 10%-20% or 0%-10% or 0% to 30%) after said treatment and has a Tg greater than 37° C., and the stent prosthesis at body temperature is radially expandable and has sufficient strength to support a body lumen. In one embodiment, the Tg is greater than 37° C. and less than 60° C., preferably greater than 37° C. and less than 55° C., more preferably greater than 37° C. and less than 45° C., more preferably greater than 35° C. and less than 45° C. In some embodiments, the endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) or the polymeric article (e.g., a polymeric tube) from which it is formed, with or without at least one surface being positioned against a non-deformable surface (e.g., the stent or the polymeric tube optionally being placed inside a non-deformable tube having a larger diameter), is pressurized to at least about 100 psi, 200 psi, 300 psi, 400 psi, 500 psi, 600 psi or 700 psi, with or without added heat, and in the presence or absence of carbon dioxide gas or liquid. In further embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of an endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) has increased strength and/or crystallinity (e.g., through induced or increased orientation of crystals, crystalline regions or polymer chains), and/or has reduced residual or internal stress, by at least heating the endoprosthesis and/or the polymeric article (e.g., a polymeric tube) from which it is formed at a temperature equal to the Tg, or above the Tg and below the Tm, or equal to or above the Tm, of the material (e.g., polymeric material), or below Tg, for a period of time (e.g., at least about 0.01, 1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 or 48 hours), and quickly or slowly cooling the endoprosthesis and/or the polymeric article to a lower temperature (e.g., at least about 10° C., 20° C., 25° C., 30° C., 40° C. or 50° C. below the Tg, or to ambient temperature or below); or by at least minimizing heating conditions of the tubular body or stent during processing such that % crystallinity does not increase by more than 20% or between 1% to about 20%. In some embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of an endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) has increased strength and/or crystallinity, and/or has reduced residual or internal stress, by heating the endoprosthesis and/or the polymeric article (e.g., a polymeric tube) from which it is formed at a temperature at least about 1° C., 5° C., 10° C., 20° C., 30° C., 40° C. to about 50° C. (e.g., polymeric material) for a period of time (e.g., at least about 0.1, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 or 48 hours), and quickly or slowly cooling the endoprosthesis and/or the polymeric article to lower temperature (e.g., at least about 10° C., 20° C., 25° C., 30° C., 40° C. or 50° C. below the Tg, or to ambient temperature or below). In certain embodiments, the endoprosthesis and/or the polymeric article are heated at a temperature equal to or no more than about 1° C., 5° C., 10° C., 15° C., 20° C., 25° C. or 30° C. below the temperature used to induce or increase orientation of crystals, crystalline regions or polymer chains of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the endoprosthesis or the polymeric article. Another modification treatment that a polymeric article (e.g., a polymeric tube) and/or an endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) can undergo is crosslinking. A polymeric material comprising the body of the endoprosthesis and/or a polymeric material comprising any coating on the endoprosthesis can be crosslinked by exposure to radiation (e.g., UV radiation or ionizing radiation, such as e-beam or gamma radiation), exposure to heat, use of a crosslinker, or use of a crosslinking agent and an initiator, as described herein. In certain embodiments, the polymeric material(s) are crosslinked by exposure to e-beam or gamma radiation having a cumulative dose of about 1 kGy to about 1000 KGy, or about 5 kGy to about 100 kGy, or about 10 kGy to about 50 kGy, or about 10 kGy to about 30 kGy, or about 20 kGy to about 60 kGy, or about 20 kGy to about 40 kGy. Crosslinking of the polymeric material(s) can be performed, e.g., to increase their crystallinity and/or reduce recoil of an endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) comprised of the polymeric material(s). In another embodiment, the biodegradable stent material has increased crystallinity by increasing orientation of polymer chains with in the biodegradable stent material in radial and/or longitudinal direction by drawing, pressurizing and/or heating the stent material. In another embodiment, the drawing, pressurizing and/or heating the stent material occurs simultaneously or sequentially. In one embodiment, the biodegradable stent material is placed with at least one surface against a non deformable surface and is pressurized to at least 200 psi, preferably to at least 300 psi, more preferably to at least 500 psi. In another embodiment, the biodegradable stent material is pressurized to at least 200 psi, preferably to at least 300 psi, more preferably to at least 500 psi. In one embodiment, the biodegradable stent material tube is placed with in a larger diameter non deformable tube and is pressurized to at least 200 psi, preferably to at least 300 psi, more preferably to at least 500 psi. In another embodiment, the biodegradable stent material tube is pressurized to at least 200 psi, preferably to at least 300 psi, more preferably to at least 500 psi. In one embodiment, the biodegradable stent material has increased crystallinity by increasing the orientation of the polymer chains by at least heating the biodegradable stent material above its glass transition temperature (Tg) and below its melting temperature. In one embodiment, the biodegradable stent material has increased crystallinity by heating the material to a temperature at least 10° C. higher than its Tg, preferably at least 20° C. higher, more preferably at least 30° C. higher than the Tg of the biodegradable stent material. In one embodiment, biodegradable stent material has increased crystallinity after drawing, heat and/or pressurizing and annealing at elevated temperature with or without vacuum. In one embodiment, the annealing temperature is below the temperature used for orientation of the polymer chains of the biodegradable stent material. In another embodiment, the annealing temperature is at most 20° C. below, preferably at most 15° C. below, more preferably at most 10° C. below the temperature for orientation of the polymer chains of the biodegradable stent material. In one embodiment, the biodegradable stent material after annealing is quenched below Tg of the biodegradable stent material, preferably at least 25° C. below Tg, more preferably at least 50° C. below Tg of the biodegradable stent material. The polymeric material or the tubular body formed there from can be modified to control crystallinity (e.g., degree of crystallinity) of the polymeric material. In certain embodiments, the substantially amorphous or semi-crystalline polymeric material or the tubular body formed therefrom undergoes a modification treatment to introduce a desired degree of crystallinity into the polymeric material to increase the strength of the polymeric material without substantially lengthening its degradation time. In another embodiment, tubular body comprising the polymer or copolymer comprised of at least one of PLLA, PLLA-PCL, or PLGA, wherein the tubular body or stent is substantially amorphous or semi crystalline after modification. In another embodiment, the tubular body comprising the polymer or copolymer is comprised of at least one of PLLA, PLLA-PCL, or PLGA, wherein the tubular body or stent is substantially amorphous or semi crystalline after modification, and wherein the crystallinity ranges from about 5% to about 40%. In another embodiment, the tubular body comprising the polymer or copolymer is comprised of at least one of PLLA, PLLA-PCL, PLGA, wherein the tubular body or stent is substantially amorphous or semi crystalline after modification, and wherein the crystallinity ranges from about 5% to about 30%. In another embodiment, the tubular body comprising the polymer or copolymer is comprised of at least one of PLLA, PLLA-PCL, PLGA, wherein the tubular body or stent is substantially amorphous or semi crystalline after modification and wherein the crystallinity ranges from about 5% to about 25%. The treated stent or other endoprosthesis can be crimped onto a delivery balloon using mechanical crimpers comprising of wedges such as crimpers from Machine Solutions, Fortimedix, or others. The stent can also be crimped by placing the stent in a shrink tube and stretching the shrink tube slowly at a rate of 0.1 to 2 inches/minutes, more preferably 0.2 to 0.5 inches/minutes until the stent is crimped to the desired crimped diameter. During crimping, the stent is heated to a temperature of 20° C. below the Tg to 10° C. above the Tg for 30 minutes, more preferably to 10° C. below the Tg to Tg, and most preferably at the Tg of the stent material. This process facilitates or enables the stent to maintain the final crimped diameter. After crimping, the ability for the stent to remain the crimped diameter can further be improved by fixing the stent in the crimped diameter while exposing it to a temperature of 20° C. below the Tg to 10° C. above the Tg for 30 minutes, more preferably to 10° C. below the Tg to Tg, and most preferably at the Tg of the stent material, for 1 minute to 24 hours, more preferably 15 minutes to 1 hour. After holding at this crimping temperature, it is preferred to fix the stent in the crimped diameter while at or below ambient temperatures until further processing (i.e., sterilization). The stent can either be crimped while it is on the balloon of the stent delivery catheter or first crimped alone and then slipped onto the balloon of the catheter. In a further embodiment, the crimped stent is cooled below ambient temperature to lock in the crystals or terminate crystallization for 1 minute to 96 hours, more preferably 24 hours to 72 hours. In a preferred embodiment, the final crimped stent on the catheter is sterilized by 25 to 30 kGy dose of ebeam, typically with a single dose of 30 kGy or with multiple smaller doses (e.g., 3×10 kGy). The stent system is usually kept below ambient temperature before, during and/or after multiple smaller doses of sterilization. The stent that has been packaged and sterilized can also be exposed to heat treatment like that described above. In one embodiment, the biodegradable polymer stent is heated at about the Tg of the biodegradable stent material during expansion of the stent. The temperature during expansion can range from 10° C. above Tg to 10° C. below Tg. Upon deployment of such stent, the processes provide means to minimize stent recoil to less than 10% after expansion from the crimped state to an expanded state. A stent can be crimped to a smaller diameter using a mechanical crimper. A stent can also be crimped by placing the stent in a shrink tube and stretching the shrink tube slowly at a rate of about 0.1 to about 2 inches/minute, or about 0.1 to about 1 inch/minute, or about 0.2 to about 0.5 inch/minute, until the stent is crimped to the desired diameter. A stent can be crimped onto the balloon of a delivery catheter, or can be crimped and then mounted onto the balloon of a catheter to provide a stent delivery system. In certain embodiments, a stent is crimped at ambient temperature, or is crimped at a temperature (crimping temperature) of at least about 30° C., 35° C., 40° C., 45° C. or 50° C., and then the stent crimped at elevated temperature is cooled to a lower temperature (e.g., at least about 5° C., 10° C., 15° C., 20° C., 25° C. or 30° C. below the crimping temperature, or to ambient temperature or below). In an embodiment, the stent is crimped at about 35° C. or above, and then the crimped stent is cooled to a temperature at least about 5° C. below the crimping temperature. In further embodiments, the crimping temperature is at or below the Tg of the material (e.g., polymeric material) of which the stent body is composed, or at least about 1° C., 5° C., 10° C., 15° C., 20° C., 25° C., 30° C., 35° C., 40° C., 45° C. or 50° C. below the Tg. In an embodiment, the crimping temperature is at least about 5° C. below the Tg of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the stent body. In some embodiments, a stent is exposed to the crimping temperature for at least about 0.5, 1, 3, 5 or 10 minutes and allowed to reach the crimping temperature prior to being crimped. The stent can be exposed to the crimping temperature using a heated crimper. The crimped stent can be stabilized in the crimped state as described herein. In additional embodiments, the crimped stent is cooled below ambient temperature for a period of about 1 minute to about 96 hours, or about 24 hours to about 72 hours, or about 30 minutes to about 48 hours, or about 1 hour to about 48 hours, or about 1 hour to about 36 hours, or about 1 hour to about 24 hours, or about 1 hour to about 12 hours, or about 4 hours to about 12 hours, to stabilize the stent, and/or stabilize the crystals and/or terminate crystallization in the stent polymeric material. In some embodiments, a stent is exposed to carbon dioxide gas at elevated pressure (e.g., at least about 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450 or 500 psi) for a period of time (e.g., at least about 10, 20 or 30 minutes, or at least about 1, 2 or 3 hours), e.g., to soften the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the stent and/or a coating on the stent. After exposure to carbon dioxide, the stent can be crimped at or below the Tg of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the stent (e.g., at least about 1° C., 5° C., 10° C., 15° C., 20° C., 25° C., 30° C., 35° C., 40° C., 45° C. or 50° C. below the Tg), or at about ambient temperature to about 50° C. An endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent or a stent delivery system) and/or the polymeric article (e.g., a polymeric tube) from which it is formed can be exposed to ionizing radiation such as electron beam or gamma radiation or to ethylene oxide gas (e.g., for purposes of sterilization) as described herein. In addition to serving as a sterilization treatment, such exposure can serve as a modification or treatment in that it can, e.g., control crystallinity (e.g., degree of crystallinity) and/or enhance the strength of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the polymeric article or the endoprosthesis. In some embodiments, the polymeric article and/or the endoprosthesis are exposed to a single dose or multiple doses of e-beam or gamma radiation totaling about 5 or 10 kGy to about 50 kGy, or about 20 kGy to about 40 kGy of radiation, e.g., a single dose of 30 kGy or multiple smaller doses (e.g., 3×10 kGy doses), where the polymeric article and/or the endoprosthesis are cooled to low temperature (e.g., about −10° C. to about −30° C., or about −20° C.) for a period of time (e.g., at least about 20, 30 or 40 minutes) prior to exposure to the single dose or to each of the multiple doses of radiation. In certain embodiments, the polymeric article and/or the endoprosthesis are exposed to a single dose or multiple doses of e-beam or gamma radiation totaling about 10 kGy to about 50 kGy, or about 30 kGy. A polymeric article and/or an endoprosthesis that have been exposed to ionizing radiation or ethylene oxide gas can also undergo one or more other modification treatments (e.g., heating or annealing) described herein. In certain embodiments, an endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) is patterned by laser cutting or other method from a polymeric tube that has a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter substantially equal to or smaller than an intended deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of the endoprosthesis. In other embodiments, an endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) is patterned from a polymeric tube that has a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter, either when the tube is formed or after the tube is radially expanded to a second larger diameter, larger than an intended deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of the endoprosthesis. Patterning a stent from a polymeric tube having a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter larger than an intended deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of the stent can impart advantageous characteristics to the stent, such as reducing radially inward recoil of the stent after deployment. In certain embodiments, a stent is patterned from a polymeric tube having a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter about 0.85, 0.90, 1.0, 1.05 to about 1.5 times, or about 1.1 to about 1.5 times, or about 1.1 to about 1.3 times, or about 1.15 to about 1.25 times, smaller, same, or larger than an intended deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of the stent. In an embodiment, the stent is patterned from a polymeric tube having a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter about 1.1 to about 1.3 times larger than an intended deployed (e.g., inner) diameter of the stent. For example, a stent having a deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of about 2.5, 3 or 3.5 mm can be patterned from a tube having a (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of about 2.75, 3.3 or 3.85 mm (1.1 times larger), or about 3.25, 3.9 or 4.55 mm (1.3 times larger), or some other (e.g., inner or outer) diameter larger than the deployed (e.g., inner or outer) diameter of the stent. In other embodiments, the initial diameter of the formed tube is larger than the crimped diameter (e.g., crimped diameter on a delivery system) of the stent prosthesis wherein the tubular body is expanded to a second larger diameter than the initial diameter before patterning or before crimping to the crimped diameter; or wherein the tubular body remains substantially the same diameter before patterning or before crimping to a crimped diameter; or wherein the tubular body is crimped to a smaller diameter than the initial formed diameter before patterning or after patterning. In another embodiment, the initial diameter of the formed tube is smaller than the crimped diameter of the stent prosthesis wherein the tubular body is expanded to a second larger diameter than the initial diameter before patterning or before crimping; or wherein the tubular body remains substantially the same diameter before patterning or before crimping; or wherein the tubular body is crimped to a smaller diameter than the crimped diameter of the stent prosthesis before patterning or after patterning. In another embodiment, the initial diameter of the formed tubular body is greater than 0.015 inches, or greater than 0.050 inches, or greater than 0.092 inches, or greater than 0.120 inches, or greater than 0.150 inches. Stent prosthesis intended deployment diameter is the diameter of the labeled delivery system or balloon catheter. For example when a stent prosthesis is crimped onto a balloon labeled 3.0 mm diameter, the stent prosthesis' intended deployment diameter is 3.0 mm. Similarly, self expandable stent crimped onto a delivery system is labeled a certain deployment diameter. The stent cut from a polymeric tube can be any kind of stent and can have any pattern and design suitable for its intended use, including any kind of stent and any pattern and design described herein. Further, the stent can be a fully self-expandable stent, a balloon-expandable stent, or a stent capable of radially self-expanding prior to balloon expansion to an intended deployed diameter. The stent material may lose some crystallinity during stent cutting. In such cases, the stent annealed after cutting and/or a second time to re-crystallize the polymer to a higher crystallinity. Thus, the cut stent may be annealed a second time as generally described above. Annealing/heating followed by cooling as described above can be repeated one or more times to further increase crystallinity. In a further embodiment, the heat treated stent is cooled below ambient temperature to lock in the crystals or terminate crystallization for 1 minute to 96 hours, more preferably 24 hours to 72 hours. In certain embodiments, the polymeric article is a polymeric tube and the structure is a substantially cylindrical structure. In an embodiment, the substantially cylindrical structure is a mandrel. In further embodiments, the polymeric tube is substantially concentric. In certain embodiments, the polymeric tube has a concentricity of about 0.0025 inch (about 64 microns) or less, or about 0.002 inch (about 51 microns) or less, or about 0.0015 inch (about 38 microns) or less, or about 0.001 inch (about 25 microns) or less, or about 0.0005 inch (about 13 microns) or less, or about 0.00025 inch (about 6 microns) or less. In an embodiment, concentricity is two times the distance between the centers of the inner and outer diameters of the tube. In some embodiments, the polymeric tube has a percent concentricity of at least about 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%. In an embodiment, percent concentricity is calculated as follows: % concentricity=(minimum wall thickness/maximum wall thickness)×100. In certain embodiments, the polymeric tube has a concentricity of about 0.001 inch (about 25 microns) or less, or a percent concentricity of at least about 90%. When the biodegradable device is a stent, in some embodiments the stent is patterned from a polymeric tube that has a (e.g., inner) diameter substantially equal to an intended deployment (e.g., inner) diameter or the maximum allowable expansion (e.g., inner) diameter of the stent. In other embodiments, the stent is patterned from a polymeric tube that has a (e.g., inner) diameter greater than (e.g., at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45% or 50% greater than) an intended deployment (e.g., inner) diameter or the maximum allowable expansion (e.g., inner) diameter of the stent. In an embodiment, the stent is patterned from a polymeric tube that has a (e.g., inner) diameter at least about 10% greater than an intended deployment (e.g., inner) diameter or the maximum allowable expansion (e.g., inner) diameter of the stent. In some embodiments, the stent is patterned from a polymeric tube that has a (e.g., inner) diameter of about 2.5 mm to about 4.5 mm, or about 2.75 mm to about 4.5 mm, or about 3 mm to about 4.5 mm, or about 2.75 mm to about 4 mm, or about 3 mm to about 4 mm, or about 3.3 mm to about 3.8 mm. In certain embodiments, the stent is patterned from a polymeric tube that has a (e.g., inner) diameter of about 2.75 mm to about 4.5 mm, or about 2.75 mm to about 4 mm. In one embodiment, the tubular body or stent prosthesis diameter ranges from about 0.25 mm to about 25 mm, preferably from about 2 mm to about 15 mm, more preferably from about 2.5 mm to about 10 mm, and most preferably from about 3 mm to about 7 mm. The stent or other endoprosthesis is patterned from a tube of the stent material in an expanded diameter and subsequently crimped to a smaller diameter and fitted onto a balloon of a delivery catheter. The stent is patterned, typically by laser cutting, with the tubing diameter about 1 to 1.3 times, preferably 1.1 to 1.5 times, more preferably 1.15 to 1.25 times, larger the intended deployed diameter. For example, a stent cut at a 3.5 mm×18 mm outer diameter is crimped on a 3.0 mm×18 mm stent delivery catheter. In a further embodiment, the unannealed and/or annealed stent is exposed to ebeam or gamma radiation, with single or multiple doses of radiation ranging from 5 kGy to 100 kGy, more preferably from 10 kGy to 50 kGy. An intended deployment diameter is one or more of the following: the labeled deployment diameter of the stent prosthesis. An example is a stent prosthesis IFU or box or label with a certain labeled diameter such as a nominal deployment diameter, for example 3.0 mm. It can also be the deployed diameter of the stent prosthesis. It can also be a diameter between a nominal deployment diameter and the rated burst diameter or higher. It can also be the diameter (where in the case of a balloon or mechanical expansion) where the balloon is expanded to at least 90% of the nominal diameter of the balloon. The most preferred embodiment of an intended deployment diameter is the labeled deployment diameter or the nominal deployment diameter. In a preferred embodiment, when the stent is expanded to at least 1 times or at least 1.1 times or at least 1.15 times or at least 1.2 times or at least 1.25 time or at least 1.3 times, or at least 1.4, or at least 1.5 times deployed diameter or an intended deployment diameter at 37° C., wherein the stent prosthesis is capable of expansion to at least said diameters without breakage/fracture in one or more of the stent prosthesis struts, crowns, or links.

In certain embodiments, the material comprising the body of the device or the biodegradable copolymer or the stent has a degree of crystallinity of about 0% to about 30% and a Tg of about or greater than 10° C. to about 35° C. The biodegradable stent prosthesis comprising a tubular body comprising a biodegradable polymeric material, wherein the tubular body has been formed using extrusion, molding, dipping, or spraying, said biodegradable polymeric material has an initial crystallinity and has a Tg greater than 37° C. and the stent prosthesis has a crystallinity (biodegradable stent material) lower than the initial crystallinity and at body temperature is radially expandable and has sufficient strength to support a body lumen. In another embodiment of any of the above embodiments, the Tg is greater than 30° C. and less than 60° C., preferably greater than 30° C. and less than 55° C., preferably greater than 30° C. and less than 45° C., more preferably greater than 30° C. and less than 40° C., or more preferably greater than 30° C. and less than 37° C. In still further embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or the biodegradable copolymer or polymer has a glass transition temperature (Tg) of at least about 10° C., 15° C., 20° C., 25° C., 30° C., 35° C., 37° C., 38° C., 40° C., 45° C., 50° C., 55° C., 60° C., 65° C. or 70° C. In some embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or the biodegradable copolymer has a Tg of about 10° C., 35° C., 37° C. or 38° C. to about 70° C.; or about 10° C., 35° C., 37° C. or 38° C. to about 65° C.; or about 10° C., 35° C., 37° C. or 38° C. to about 60° C.; or about 10° C., 35° C., 37° C. or 38° C. to about 55° C.; or about 10° C., 35° C., 37° C. or 38° C. to about 50° C. In certain embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or the biodegradable copolymer has a Tg of about 35° C. to about 70° C., or about 45° C. to about 60° C., or about 45° C. to about 55° C. In further embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or the biodegradable copolymer has a Tg of about 10° C. to about 37° C., or about 40° C. to about 60° C. In some embodiments, the Tg refers to the Tg of the tubular body or the polymeric material in a pellet form or after forming the tubular body or before treatment(s) or after treatment(s) or prior to implantation. In some embodiments, when the treatment or modification is by heating, said heating can be at about Tg or below Tg, and the treatment(s) is prior to patterning or after patterning. In other embodiments, the heat treatment or modification can be during patterning, such as during laser patterning. In some embodiments, the Tg refers to the Tg of the tubular body or the polymeric material as a pellet or after forming the tube, or the Tg is measured prior to the treatment or modification, or the Tg is measured after the treatment or modification, or the Tg is measured prior to implantation. In other embodiments, it is desired to control Tg to a desired range from 30° C. to 60° C., preferably 35° C. to 55° C., more preferably from 37° C. to 50° C., more preferably greater than 37° C. to 50° C. This allows for fabrication of a stent prosthesis capable of radial expansion at body temperature, or above body temperature, or below body temperature. Examples of controlling Tg (e.g., lowering it) can be accomplished through additives such as plasticizers and monomers, presence or addition of solvents (such water, DCM, ethanol), and radiation. Controlling Tg (e.g., increasing it) can be accomplished by heating the material (below Tg, Tg, or above Tg), pressurizing the material, removing additives or platicizers or solvents, and sometimes (depending on the material) through radiation. Control of radiation, increase or decrease or maintaining it, from substantially maintaining it the same from after forming to prior to implant, or increasing it from forming to prior to implant, or decreasing it from forming to prior to implant. In some embodiments Tg changes ranging from 0% change in Tg to 100% change in Tg, preferably from 5% to 50%, and more preferably 10% to 25%. In other embodiment, Tg changes by at least 0% from initial Tg, or by at least 10% of the initial or original Tg, and more preferably Tg changes by at least 25% of the original Tg. In one embodiment, the biodegradable stent prosthesis comprising a tubular body comprising a biodegradable polymeric material, wherein the tubular body has been formed using extrusion, molding, dipping, or spraying, said biodegradable polymeric material has been treated to control Tg to between 35° C. to 55° C., and the stent prosthesis at body temperature is radially expandable and has sufficient strength to support a body lumen. In additional embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or the biodegradable polymer or copolymer has a melting enthalpy (ΔHm) of about 7 J/g to about 50 J/g, or about 7 J/g to about 45 J/g, or about 7 J/g to about 40 J/g, or about 20 J/g to about 45 J/g, or about 20 J/g to about 40 J/g, or about 20 J/g to about 35 J/g, or about 25 J/g to about 35 J/g. In an embodiment, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or the biodegradable copolymer or polymer has a ΔHm of about 7 J/g to about 50 J/g. In further embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or the biodegradable copolymer or polymer has a crystallization enthalpy (ΔHc) less than about 5 J/g, or less than about 3 J/g, or less than about 1 J/g, or of about 0 J/g, during first heating. In yet further embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or the biodegradable copolymer or polymer has a crystallization enthalpy less than about 5 J/g, or less than about 3 J/g, or less than about 1 J/g, or of about 0 J/g, during first cooling. In certain embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or the biodegradable copolymer or polymer has a ΔHc less than about 5 J/g during first heating and a ΔHc less than about 5 J/g during first cooling. In another embodiment, it is desired to control crystallinity in a manner to preserve the material properties after forming. For example it is desirable to treat the tubular body or the biodegradable polymeric material wherein the crystallinity of the tubular body after forming is substantially unchanged from the crystallinity of the stent prosthesis material prior to implant. In such cases, the treatment(s) of the biodegradable polymeric material controls maintaining crystallinity to be substantially the same. In another embodiment, it is desired to control crystallinity in a manner to lower crystallinity after forming. For example it is desirable to treat the tubular body or the biodegradable polymeric material wherein the crystallinity of the stent prosthesis material prior to implant is lower than the crystallinity of the tubular body after forming. The biodegradable stent prosthesis comprising a tubular body comprising a biodegradable polymeric material, wherein the tubular body has been formed using extrusion, molding, dipping, or spraying, said biodegradable polymeric material has an initial crystallinity and has a Tg greater than 37° C., and the stent prosthesis has a crystallinity (biodegradable stent material) that is substantially the same as the initial crystallinity and at body temperature is radially expandable and has sufficient strength to support a body lumen. The biodegradable stent prosthesis comprising a tubular body comprising a biodegradable polymeric material, wherein the tubular body has been formed using extrusion, molding, dipping, or spraying, said biodegradable polymeric material has an initial crystallinity and has a Tg greater than 37° C., and the stent prosthesis has a crystallinity (biodegradable stent material) lower than the initial crystallinity and at body temperature is radially expandable and has sufficient strength to support a body lumen. In another embodiment of any of the above embodiments, the Tg is greater than 30° C. and less than 60° C., preferably greater than 30° C. and less than 55° C., preferably, greater than 30° C. and less than 45° C., more preferably greater than 30° C. and less than 40° C., or more preferrably greater than 30° C. and less than 37° C. A measure of residual/internal stress in a polymeric article or a device is shrinkage of the polymeric article or the device in a direction (e.g., longitudinal direction and/or radial direction) over a period of time when the polymeric article or the device is heated over that period of time at about the Tg or above the Tg or below the Tg of the material comprising the polymeric article or the body of the device. In some embodiments, a tube comprised of a biodegradable polymeric material or a stent formed from such a tube exhibits shrinkage in length of no more than about 25%, 20%, 15%, 10% or 5%, and/or shrinkage in diameter of no more than about 25%, 20%, 15%, 10% or 5%, over a period of time (e.g., about 0.1, 12, 24, 48 to about 72 hours) when the tube or the stent is heated over that period of time at about the Tg, or above Tg, or below Tg (e.g., about 5° C., 10° C., 20° C. or 30° C. above) the Tg of the polymeric material comprising the tube or the stent body, or (e.g., about 5° C., 10° C., 20° C., or 30° C.) below the Tg of the polymeric material comprising the tube or the stent body. In certain embodiments, a tube comprised of a biodegradable polymeric material or a stent formed from such a tube exhibits shrinkage in length of no more than about 10% or 5%, and/or shrinkage in diameter of no more than about 10% or 5%, over a period of time (e.g., about 1, 12, or 24 hours) when the tube or the stent is heated over that period of time at about the Tg or above (e.g., about 10° C. or 20° C. to about 30° C. above) the Tg, or below Tg (e.g., about 5° C., 10° C., to about 30° C. below Tg of the polymeric material comprising the tube or the stent body. In a further embodiment, the biodegradable stent comprising a body which comprises a biodegradable copolymer, polymer blends, polymer blocks, polymeric mixtures (with a combination of two or more polymers) wherein suitable copolymers, including the ones described herein, but not limited to the disclosed copolymers, are configured to be capable of balloon expandable and self expanding, wherein prior to being balloon-expanded, the stent radially self-expands by about 0.001-0.025 inches, or about 0.003-0.015 inches, or 0.005-0.10 inches, or about 0.001 inches or more, or about 0.003 inches or more, or about 0.005 inches or more, or about 0.010 inches or more, or about 0.025 inch (about 635 microns) or more, or by about 0.25% or more of an initial crimped diameter of the stent, after being in aqueous condition at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo for about 1 minute or less, or about 5 minutes or less, or about 15 minutes or less, and wherein the stent or the stent body has one or more of the following properties and retains one or more such properties during a period of use: radial strength of about 5 psi to about 20 psi, or about 5 psi or greater, or about 10 psi or greater, or about 15 psi or greater; recoil of about 3%-10% or about 10% or less; % elongation at break of about 50%, or about 100%-about 600%, or about 50% to about 300%; Tg of about 37° C.-60° C. or Tg of about 45° C.-55° C., after being in aqueous condition at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo for about 1 minute or less, or about 5 minutes or less, or about 15 minutes or less. Other applicable properties are described in the disclosure herein. In further embodiments, the stent self expands to a diameter that is less than the final intended deployment diameter of the stent prior to being balloon expanded to the final intended deployment diameter after being in aqueous condition at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo for about 1 minute or less, or about 5 minutes or less, or about 15 minutes or less. In some embodiments, the properties described herein with respect to the material (e.g., polymeric material) such as inherent viscosity, tensile strength, percent elongation at break or yield, and ductility are in the ranges stated prior to deployment of the stent, or after deployment of the stent. A partially self-expandable stent can be retained on a balloon-catheter by any suitable means, including any means described herein. Such a stent can be restrained from prematurely self-expanding by partially or fully covering the stent with a sheath or other constraining means. After the stent is delivered to an intended site of deployment, the sheath or other constraining means can be withdrawn or removed to allow the stent to radially self-expand prior to balloon-expansion to an intended deployment diameter. Partial self-expansion of a stent can be promoted or controlled by any of a variety of ways. For example, the body of the stent can be comprised of a polymeric material that has a Tg closer to but above body temperature. The stent polymeric material having a Tg closer to but above body temperature can control self-expansion of the stent. Having some differentiation between the Tg of the stent polymeric material and body temperature can prevent self-expansion of a crimped stent that has some memory of the larger diameter of the polymeric tube from which it was patterned, as soon as the stent reaches body temperature. Water permeability of the polymeric material comprising the stent body can promote self-expansion of the stent, as water absorption into the stent body can cause the stent to swell and self-expand. Coating the stent with a material that is more crystalline or reduces water absorption, or incorporating an additive in the coating of the stent which reduces water absorption or reacts with water, can control self-expansion of the stent. Moreover, exposing the crimped stent to low heat (e.g., about 20° C. to about 35° C. for at least about 5, 12, 24, 36, 48 or 72 hours, or about 30° C. for at least about 2, 8, 16 or 24 hours) can control self-expansion of the stent when in aqueous condition at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. In some embodiments, the biodegradable stent is capable of being crimped to, e.g., inner (luminal)] diameter of about 0.5 mm to about 4 mm, or about 1 mm to about 2 mm, or about 1.2 mm to about 1.6 mm, or about 1.3 mm to about 1.5 mm, and is capable of being radially expanded, e.g., in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo, to a (e.g., inner) diameter of about 2 mm to about 8 mm, or about 2 mm to about 6 mm, or about 2 mm to about 4 mm, or about 2.5 mm to about 4 mm, or about 2.7 mm to about 3.8 mm, or about 3 mm to about 3.6 mm, without substantial damage to struts, crowns or links of the stent, or without breakage/fracture to struts, crowns or links of the stent, or without substantial recoil, or all three. In certain embodiments, the stent is capable of being crimped to a (e.g., inner) diameter of about 1.2 mm to about 1.6 mm and is capable of being radially expanded, e.g., in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo, to a (e.g., inner) diameter of about 2.5 mm to about 4 mm without substantial damage to struts, crowns or links or without substantial recoil, or both. In further embodiments, the biodegradable stent is capable of being radially expanded, e.g., in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo, to an initial deployment diameter and then to a second deployment diameter that is about 1% to about 300%, or about 10% to about 300%, or about 10% to about 100%, or to a greater than the initial deployment diameter, wherein the stent is uniformly expanded; or without substantial damage and/or without fracture/breakage to struts, crowns or links of the stent or/and without substantial recoil; or at least some. In additional embodiments, the biodegradable stent is capable of being radially expanded to an intended deployment diameter. e.g., in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo with about 50% or less of crowns of the stent having a crack length of about 50% of the local crown width or shorter, or about 40% or less of the crowns having a crack length of about 40% of the local crown width or shorter, or about 30% or less of the crowns having a crack length of about 30% of the local crown width or shorter, or about 25% or less of the crowns having a crack length of about 25% of the local crown width or shorter, or about 20% or less of the crowns having a crack length of about 20% of the local crown width or shorter, or about 10% or less of the crowns having a crack length of about 10% of the local crown width or shorter, or about 5% or less of the crowns having a crack length of about 5% of the local crown width or shorter. In certain embodiments, the stent is capable of being radially expanded to an intended deployment diameter, e.g., in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo, with about 25% or less of the crowns having a crack length of about 25% of the local crown width or shorter. In certain embodiment, the stent is capable of being deployed to an expanded diameter ranging from about 2 mm to about 4 mm in aqueous environment at 37° C. without breakage (fracture) in any of the struts, crowns, or links. In yet another embodiment, the stent prosthesis is capable of uniform radial expansion to an intended diameter from a crimped state without cracks, or without fracture/breakage in any of the links, struts, or crowns. Cracking or fracture of a structure (e.g., a stent) can be analyzed by any suitable method known in the art, including without limitation by visualization using a microscope, optical comparator or scanning electron microscope. Cracking or fracture of a biodegradable polymeric stent can be reduced by any of a variety of ways. For example, treatment of the polymeric material, control of one of Tg, crystallinity, and molecular weight. Additional treatment, design, or control of material properties include: making the body of the stent from a polymeric material that is ductile and tough under physiological conditions can reduce cracking of the stent. Water permeability of the stent polymeric material can also reduce cracking (and improve radial strength) of the stent. When water permeates into the stent body, it can swell the polymeric material of the body, which can reduce the brittleness of the polymeric material. Further, designing the stent to have a longer radius of curvature can reduce cracking or fracture/breakage. Moreover, minimizing exposure of the crimped stent to heat (in terms of, e.g., temperature and exposure time), as described herein with respect to reducing recoil, can decrease cracking of the stent. In some embodiment, the stent is at least partially configured to radially self expand to decrease cracking or breakage of struts, crowns, or links upon deployment of the stent. The conditions and manner in which the stent is radially expanded can also affect cracking (and radial strength and recoil) of the stent. Other means of reducing cracking include without limitation allowing the stent to reach approximately body temperature, or within about 2° C. to about 25° C. of body temperature, prior to balloon radial expansion, and/or allowing time (e.g., at least about 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 minutes) for the stent to heat or/and absorb water into the stent prior to balloon radial expansion. Moreover, cracking or fracture can be decreased by radially expanding the stent substantially uniformly such that crowns of the stent open at a substantially similar angle, or within 50 degrees of one another. Furthermore, cracking or fracture can be reduced by maintaining a balloon-expanded stent at the radially expanded state with the balloon inflated for a longer time (e.g., at least about 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 minutes), and/or using a stent-delivery catheter (e.g., Lifestream catheter from Abbott) that allows blood to flow through while the balloon is inflated for a longer time (e.g., about 1, 3 or 5 or more minutes). If the stent is a balloon-expandable stent (whether partially self-expandable or not), a slow rate of inflation of the balloon in the beginning of balloon-assisted expansion can reduce cracking. For example, a 3 mm stent can be deployed (radially expanded to the intended deployment diameter) by inflation of the balloon to about 6 to 16 atmospheres of pressure. During the first about 2 to 3 atmospheres of pressure, the rate of inflation of the balloon can be about 2 or 5 to about 20 seconds per atmosphere, or about 7 to about 15 seconds per atmosphere. Thereafter the balloon can be inflated at a faster rate (e.g., about 0.1 to about 5 seconds per atmosphere). After the stent is radially expanded to the intended deployment diameter, the pressure of the balloon can be maintained for a period of time, e.g., for at least about 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 or 3 minutes. A stent-delivery catheter (e.g., Lifestream catheter) that allows blood to flow through while the balloon is inflated can be employed. Exposure of the stent to a temperature substantially equal to or above body temperature prior to and/or during radial expansion can also decrease cracking or fracture of the stent. In certain embodiments, prior to and/or during radial expansion the stent is exposed to a temperature at least about 1° C., 4° C., 8° C., 12° C. or 16° C. above body temperature, or to a temperature within about 20° C., 15° C., 10° C. or 5° C. of the Tg (below or above the Tg), or equal to or above the Tg, of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the stent. Exposure of the stent to a temperature substantially equal to or above body temperature can be accomplished by any of a variety of means, such as use of a heating coil or element(s) in the balloon, use of heating element(s) on the surface of the balloon or the proximal shaft of the delivery catheter, heating of a liquid inside the balloon, introduction of a heated liquid into the balloon, or introduction of a heated aqueous (e.g., saline) solution into the bodily fluid (e.g., blood stream) at the site of stent deployment. In some embodiments, fatigue of a stent is measured by the appearance of a certain number of pieces (e.g., one piece) missing from the stent, or the appearance of a certain number of fractures (e.g., two fractures), or the appearance of a certain number of cracks (e.g., three cracks), optionally under certain conditions, e.g., in dry condition or in aqueous condition (e.g., aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at a certain temperature (e.g., ambient temperature or about 37° C.) in vitro or in vivo, and optionally over a certain period of time (e.g., about 1 minute to about 1, 2 or 3 weeks, or about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 months). In certain embodiments, a crack is cracking that does not extend through the whole width of a crown, and a fracture is cracking that extends through the whole width or depth of a crown, strut, or a link, thereby breaking the crown, strut, or link. In further embodiments, fatigue of a stent is measured based on the number of cycles (or the number of months of fatigue) before the appearance of a certain number of pieces (e.g., one piece) missing from the stent. Fatigue testing can be conducted under real-time or accelerated condition. In a real-time test, the stent can be subjected to a cyclic loading of, e.g., about 1 to 2 Hz (about 60 to 120 cycles per minute, substantially similar to a human heart beat). The test can be conducted for about 1, 2 or 3 months or longer to simulate the time period of implantation in a subject. The stent can be tested in vitro in a tube that has a radial compliance of, e.g., about 3% to 5% (the tube could radially expand by about 3% to 5%), which is substantially similar to the compliance of an artery. Under accelerated condition, the stent can be subjected to a cyclic loading greater than about 2 Hz (e.g., about 30 Hz). At 30 Hz, it would take about 6 days of continuous cycling, compared to about 90 days at 2 Hz, to attain about 3 months of fatigue. In some embodiments, the stent does not exhibit missing pieces or complete fracture of a link, a strut, or a crown after fatigue testing at one of the above conditions from about 1 day to about 6 months, or from about one week to about one month or from about 2 weeks to about 3 months. Resistance of a stent to fatigue (or fatigue strength) can be enhanced by any of a variety of ways. For example, fatigue resistance/strength can be increased by making the stent from a polymeric material that is ductile and tough under physiological conditions, and/or by configuring the stent to be capable of radially self-expanding prior to balloon expansion to an intended deployment diameter. As another example, fatigue resistance/strength can be enhanced by the pattern or design of the stent, by decreasing the sharpness (or increasing the smoothness) of edges of crowns of the stent, and/or by increasing the uniformity of the cross-section of the crowns. As a further example, fatigue resistance/strength can be increased by minimizing exposure of the stent to extremely high temperature or extremely low temperature, and/or by minimizing bending and other stresses on the stent (e.g., when the stent is at, below or above body temperature). In some embodiments, the biodegradable stent has a radial strength of at least about 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25 or 30 psi in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. In certain embodiments, the stent has a radial strength of about 5 psi to about 30 psi, or about 5 psi to about 25 psi, or about 10 psi to about 25 psi, or about 12 psi to about 23 psi, or about 10 psi to about 20 psi, or about 15 psi to about 20 psi, or about 16 psi to about 22 psi, in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. In certain embodiments, the stent has a radial strength of about 5 psi to about 30 psi, or about 10 psi to about 25 psi, in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. Radial strength of a biodegradable polymeric stent can be improved in any of a variety of ways. As an example, making the stent body from a polymeric material that is ductile and tough under physiological conditions can enhance the radial strength of the stent. Further, radial strength can be increased by orienting the stent polymeric material, or the crystals, crystalline regions or chains of the polymeric material, substantially in the circumferential direction. For example, prior to patterning the stent from a polymeric tube, the tube can be radially expanded, optionally while the tube is heated at elevated temperature (e.g., at or above the Tg of the tube polymeric material) and optionally with cooling of the radially expanded tube to a lower temperature (e.g., below Tg), to impart substantially circumferential orientation or biaxial (neither preferentially circumferential nor preferentially longitudinal) orientation to the polymeric material, or its crystals, crystalline regions or polymer chains. Crimping the stent to a smaller diameter under certain conditions can minimize radial strength loss upon expansion of the stent. In one embodiment, the stent is crimped gradually at a temperature ranging from about 25° C. to about 50° C. in 10 seconds to about 10 minutes. The conditions and manner in which the stent is radially expanded can also affect the radial strength of the stent. Non-limiting conditions and ways in which the stent can be radially expanded to improve radial strength are described with respect to reducing cracking or improving stent expanded uniformity. In further embodiments, the biodegradable stent exhibits a percentage radially inward recoil of about 15% or less, or about 12% or less, or about 10% or less, or about 8% or less, or about 6% or less, or about 5% or less, or about 4% or less, or about 3% or less, after a period of time (e.g., about 1, 3 or 5 days, or about 1, 2 or 3 weeks, or about 1, 2 or 3 months) after being radially expanded to an intended deployment diameter in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. In certain embodiments, the stent exhibits a percentage radially inward recoil of about 10% or less, or about 8% or less, about one week to about one month after being radially expanded to an intended deployment diameter in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. Recoil of the stent can be reduced by any of a variety of ways. For example, the body of the stent can be comprised of a polymeric material that is ductile and tough under physiological conditions, has a Tg that is not too high (e.g., about 60° C., 55° C., 50° C. or lower), and/or has a molecular weight of at least a certain value (e.g., a weight-average molecular weight of at least about 120 kDa, 150 kDa, 180 kDa, 210 kDa, 240 kDa, 500 kDa, or 900 kDa). In some embodiments, recoil of a stent comprised of a polymeric material having molecular weight in the range of about 120 kDa to about 1200 kDa is less than 10% as a result of greater entanglement of longer polymer chains. In some embodiments, the recoil of a stent comprised of a polymeric material having molecular weight in the range of about 120 kDa to about 1200 kDa is less than 10% as a result of greater entanglement of longer polymer chains. Greater entanglement of polymer chains can further reduce recoil of the polymeric tubular body having higher molecular weight. In some embodiments, a stent is designed to have reduced recoil by being configured to be fully self-expandable or be capable of radially self-expanding (e.g., by at least about 0.01 inch or 0.025 inch, or by at least about 10% or 25% of the initial crimped diameter) prior to balloon expansion to an intended deployment diameter. In certain embodiments, the body of a partially self-expandable stent is comprised of a polymeric material that has a Tg of about 35° C. to about 55 or 60° C., or about 37° C. to about 55 or 60° C., or about 40° C. to about 50 or 55° C., or about 45° C. to about 50 or 55° C. In some embodiments, during the initial partial self-expansion of the stent (e.g., by at least about 0.01 inch or 0.025 inch, or by at least about 10% or 25% of the initial crimped diameter), and/or during balloon expansion of the stent to an intended deployment diameter, the stent is exposed to a temperature within about 15° C., 10° C., 5° C. or 3° C. of the Tg (below or above the Tg), or at or above the Tg. In further embodiments, the body of a fully self-expandable stent or a partially self-expandable stent is comprised of a polymeric material that has a Tg of about 10° C. to about 35 or 37° C., or about 15° C. to about 35 or 37° C., or about 20° C. to about 30 or 35° C., or about 25° C. to about 30 or 35° C. In certain embodiments, a partially or fully self-expandable stent is patterned from a polymeric tube having a diameter greater than an intended deployment diameter or the maximum allowable expansion diameter of the stent, as described herein. Recoil of a biodegradable stent can also be reduced by patterning the stent from a polymeric tube having a diameter (e.g., inner diameter) that is slightly smaller, same, or greater than (e.g., at least about −10%, −5%, 0%, 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% or 50%) the intended deployment (e.g., inner) diameter or the maximum allowable expansion (e.g., inner) diameter of the stent. After deployment in aqueous condition at about 37° C., the stent can have a tendency or ability to self-expand over time to the larger diameter of the tube from which the stent was cut if the stent is exposed to a temperature equal to or above the Tg of the polymeric material comprising the stent body. The Tg of a polymeric material in aqueous condition (wet Tg) can be lower (e.g., about 1-5° C. lower, or about 1-10° C. lower, or about 1-15° C. lower, or about 5° C., 10° C. or 15° C. lower) than its dry Tg. The stent's tendency or ability to self-expand to the larger tube diameter can minimize or prevent radially inward recoil of the stent after deployment. The conditions in which the stent is crimped, and the crimped stent is treated and handled, can affect recoil of the stent. For example, recoil can be reduced by crimping the stent at a temperature at about the Tg or below the Tg (e.g., at least about 1° C., 5° C., 10° C., 15° C., 20° C., 25° C., 30° C., or 35° C. below the Tg) of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the stent body. Minimizing exposure of the crimped stent to heat (in terms of, e.g., temperature and exposure time), as described herein, can also reduce recoil (and reduce cracking and improve radial strength). Heat may promote generation of a crimped-state memory and may promote erasure of some amount of the as-cut tube memory (the diameter of the tube used to pattern the stent). For example, recoil can be decreased by exposing the crimped stent to a temperature not exceeding the Tg, or at least about 1° C., 5° C., 10° C., 15° C., 20° C., 25° C. or 30° C. below the Tg, of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the stent body during, e.g., stabilization of the stent in the crimped state, mounting of the crimped stent onto a balloon-catheter, sterilization of the stent delivery system (e.g., with e-beam), and storage. The conditions and manner in which the stent is radially expanded can also affect recoil of the stent. Non-limiting conditions and ways in which the stent can be radially expanded to reduce recoil are described with respect to reducing cracking. In additional embodiments, the biodegradable stent exhibits reduction in length of no more than about 25%, 20%, 15%, 10% or 5% after a period of time (e.g., about 1, 3 or 5 days, or about 1, 2 or 3 weeks, or about 1, 2 or 3 months) after being radially expanded to an intended deployment diameter in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. In certain embodiments, the biodegradable stent exhibits reduction in length of no more than about 10% about one week to about one month after being radially expanded to an intended deployment diameter in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo.

Optionally, the stent is constrained from self expanding using a sheath or other means and then such constraining means is removed, disengaged, or withdrawn, or released after the stent is positioned for deployment, allowing the stent to self deploy.

For example, glycolic acid or glycolide is an additive for a polymer containing glycolic acid/glycolide, e.g., polyglycolic acid/polyglycolide or a copolymer thereof, such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide), lactic acid or lactide is an additive for a polymer containing lactic acid/lactide, e.g., polylactic acid/polylactide or a copolymer thereof, such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide), and ε-caprolactone is an additive for a polymer containing ε-caprolactone, e.g., poly(ε-caprolactone) or a copolymer thereof, such as poly(lactide-co-ε-caprolactone). Additives that are monomers can serve any of a variety of functions, such as controlling degradation of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or a coating on the body (e.g., acidic monomers such as glycolic acid and lactic acid can promote degradation of the polymeric material), or plasticizing or softening the polymeric material, which can, e.g., reduce its crystallinity or brittleness and enhance its toughness. In other embodiments, monomers of a different type than copolymers or polymers can be used. In some embodiments, the additives are degradation-controlling agents that control degradation of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or a coating on the body, or that control degradation of any portion of the device. Non-limiting examples of degradation-controlling agents include salts (e.g., aluminum chloride, calcium chloride, ferric chloride, magnesium chloride, sodium chloride and zinc chloride), acids (e.g., ammonium chloride, aminosulfonic acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, hexafluorosilicic acid, sodium bisulfite, acetic acid, adipic acid, hydroxyadipic acids, citric acid, formic acid, lactic acid and oxalic acid), bases (e.g., potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, calcium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, phosphates, potassium phosphate, sodium phosphate, hydroxyapatites and calcium hydroxyapatite), natural and unnatural amino acids (e.g., the 20 natural amino acids in the human body), polymers with acidic or basic byproduct (e.g., polylactide and copolymers thereof, and polyglycolide and copolymers thereof), blowing agents (e.g., bromine, chlorine, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen-releasing agents, and ammonium and sodium salts, such as ammonium and sodium bicarbonate), and metals and metal alloys (e.g., metals and metal alloys that comprise calcium, chromium, lithium, magnesium, potassium, silicon, a silicate or sodium, or a combination thereof). Additional examples of degradation-controlling agents are described herein and in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/398,363, the full disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. In certain embodiments, the additives are degradation-controlling agents that promote degradation of a non-degradable polymer. For example, pro-degradant additives such as D2W, photodegradative additives such as UV-H, oxidative additives such as PDQ, and Totally Degradable Plastic Additive (TDPA™) can promote degradation of non-degradable polymers such as polyethylene, polypropylene and poly(ethylene terephthalate). In other embodiments, the additives are degradation-controlling agents that help to resist degradation of a material (e.g., a polymer, a metal or metal alloy, a biologically active agent, or another additive), such as oxidative degradation, photodegradation, high energy-exposure degradation, thermal degradation, hydrolytic degradation, acid-catalyzed degradation, or other kinds of degradation. Non-limiting examples of additives that can help to resist degradation of a material include antioxidants, e.g., vitamin C and butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT), stabilizers (e.g., xanthum gum, succinoglycan, carrageenan and propylene glycol alginate), getters (e.g., titanium-containing beads and aluminium oxide), salts (e.g., calcium chloride), and bases (e.g., potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulfate and magnesium sulfate). In addition, the additives can be water-attractant substances such as glycerol, caffeine, lidocaine, monomers, oligomers or polymers (e.g., polyvinyl alcohol or polyethylene oxide). The additives can also be water-repellent substances such as monomers, oligomers, polymers (e.g., low molecular weight polyethylene) or waxy substances (e.g., beeswax). Water-attractant additives can serve any of a variety of functions, including promoting degradation of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or a coating on the body and permeation of water into the polymeric material, which can swell the polymeric material, reduce its brittleness and increase its toughness. Water-repellent additives can serve any of a variety of functions, including slowing down degradation of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or a coating on the body. In certain embodiments, the additives are additives that reduce water absorption, act as a water barrier or react with water (designed, e.g., to control degradation of the device, control elasticity or ductility of a polymeric material comprising the device, or control self-expansion of a self-expandable device in aqueous condition at about 37° C.). For example, the additives can be metals or metal alloys that react with water, such as magnesium, magnesium alloys, iron or iron alloys. As another non-limiting example, the additives can be salts that react with water, such as calcium salts, magnesium salts or sodium salts. Additives that might be non-degradable can be removed by a variety of means, such as by cells (e.g., macrophages and monocytes) or by excretion (e.g., when they are not used in a large amount). In certain embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device, or the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising a particular layer of the body, comprises novolimus and an antioxidant. In an embodiment, the antioxidant is butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). In some embodiments, the weight percent of the antioxidant in the novolimus-containing material is about 0.1% to about 2%, or about 0.1% to about 1%, or about 0.5% to about 1%. In certain embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or any particular layer or all layers of the body comprises novolimus and BHT, wherein the weight percent of the BHT in the material is about 0.1% to about 1%. In some embodiments, the biodegradable implantable devices described herein comprise one or more reinforcement additives. The reinforcement additives can improve properties of the devices, such as strength (e.g., tensile strength, radial strength) and modulus (e.g., elastic modulus, tensile modulus). Further, the additives can increase retention or control release of a biologically active agent, e.g., as a result of physical interaction, non-covalent interaction (e.g., van der Waals interaction or hydrogen bonding), and/or covalent interaction (e.g., if the additives are functionalized) between the additive and the bioactive agent. Non-limiting examples of reinforcement additives include nanotubes (including carbon nanotubes/nanofibers and boron nanotubes/nanofibers), fullerenes (including buckyballs), nanoparticles, nanospheres, nanopowders, nanoclays, zeolites, exfoliates, fibers (including nanofibers), whiskers, platelets and polymers. Nanoclays can be added to one or more polymers comprising the body of the device or a coating on the device by any suitable method, such as in situ polymerization intercalation, melt intercalation and solution intercalation. In certain embodiments, the reinforcement additives incorporated in the body of the device, a layer of the body or a coating on the device include carbon nanotubes. In further embodiments, the device comprising one or more reinforcement additives is a stent. In some embodiments, the weight percent of a reinforcement additive in the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device, or the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising a layer of the body, or the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising a coating on the device, is about 0.01% or 0.1% to about 25%, or about 0.1% to about 15% or 20%, or about 0.1% or 0.25% to about 10%, or about 0.25% or 0.5% to about 5%, or about 1% to about 5%. In certain embodiments, the weight percent of a reinforcement additive is about 0.5% to about 5%, or about 1% to about 3%. In further embodiments, the volume fraction or volume percent of a reinforcement additive in the body of the device, a layer of the body or a coating on the device is about 0.05% or 0.1% to about 25%, or about 0.25% or 0.5% to about 10%, or about 0.75% or 1% to about 5%. In certain embodiments, the volume fraction or volume percent of a reinforcement additive is about 0.75% to about 5%, or about 1% to about 3%. In certain embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device, or the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising a particular layer of the body, comprises nanotubes (e.g., carbon nanotubes, boron nanotubes) or one or more other reinforcement additives having a larger feature (e.g., length) and a smaller feature (e.g., diameter or width) such that the ratio of these two features results in a relatively high aspect ratio. In some embodiments, the average aspect ratio (e.g., length divided by diameter or width) of a reinforcement additive is about 2 to about 40,000, or about 10 or 30 to about 25,000, or about 100 to about 1000, 5000 or 10,000, or about 50 or 100 to about 500. Incorporation of one or more reinforcement additives having a relatively high aspect ratio in the material comprising the body of the device or a layer of the body (e.g., by mixing or dispersing the additives in one or more polymers comprising the body or a layer of the body) can improve properties of the device. For example, use of such reinforcement additives can increase the strength (e.g., tensile strength, radial strength), stiffness, modulus (e.g., tensile modulus, elastic modulus), toughness, crack resistance, fatigue resistance, work to failure, and/or thermal conductivity of the device (e.g., a stent), and can decrease cracking, fatigue, creep and/or recoil of the device. In some embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device, or the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising a particular layer of the body, comprises carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes can be strong and flexible, and can enhance properties of the material, such as increasing its strength (e.g., tensile strength, radial strength) and/or modulus (e.g., elastic modulus, tensile modulus) without substantially decreasing its ductility. In certain embodiments, the device comprising carbon nanotubes is a stent. The carbon nanotubes (CNTs) can be single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs), and/or multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). In certain embodiments, the number of walls of MWCNTs is about 2 to about 5, 10, 15 or 20. In an embodiment, the number of walls of MWCNTs is about 2 to about 4. MWCNTs can potentially be straighter and/or more crystalline than SWCNTs, and can potentially provide higher mechanical properties than SWCNTs. SWCNTs can comprise a graphene sheet rolled into a cylinder, and MWCNTs can comprise multiple concentric graphene cylinders. Carbon nanotubes can be produced by any suitable method, such as high-temperature evaporation using arc discharge, laser ablation, chemical vapor deposition, high-pressure carbon monoxide, or a catalytic growth process. In some embodiments, the average length of the carbon nanotubes is about 100 nm to about 50 or 100 mm, or about 500 nm to about 0.5 or 1 mm, or about 500 nm to about 50 or 100 μm, or about 1 or 5 μm to about 50 μm, or about 10 μm to about 20 μm. In certain embodiments, the average diameter of the carbon nanotubes is about 0.4 nm to about 1 μm, or about 1 nm to about 100 or 500 nm, or about 10 or 30 nm to about 50 nm. In some embodiments, the average aspect ratio (length divided by diameter) of the carbon nanotubes is about 2 to about 40,000, or about 10 or 30 to about 25,000, or about 100 to about 1000, 5000 or 10,000. In further embodiments, the average surface area of the carbon nanotubes is about 10 to about 1000 m2/g, or about 25 to about 750 m2/g, or about 50 or 100 to about 500 m2/g. In additional embodiments, the purity of the carbon nanotubes is at least about 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98% or 99%. In an embodiment, the purity of the carbon nanotubes is at least about 95%. In certain embodiments, impurities of carbon nanotubes include amorphous carbon, heavy metals and/or chemicals. In certain embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or a particular layer of the body comprises carbon nanotubes in a weight percent of about 0.1% or 0.5% to about 10%, or about 0.1% or 0.5% to about 5%, or about 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5%, 3%, 3.5%, 4%, 4.5%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9% or 10%. In some embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or a particular layer of the body comprises carbon nanotubes in a weight percent of about 0.1% or 0.5% to about 3%, or about 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5% or 3%. In further embodiments, the carbon nanotube-containing material comprises a polylactide homopolymer or copolymer, wherein lactide includes L-lactide, D-lactide and D,L-lactide. In certain embodiments, the material comprising the body of the device or a particular layer of the body comprises a poly(L-lactide) copolymer, e.g., poly(L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) or any other poly(L-lactide) copolymer described herein, and carbon nanotubes in a weight percent of about 0.1% or 0.5% to about 3%, or about 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.5% or 3% (e.g., about 2%). One or more reinforcement additives can be incorporated in the body of the device or a coating on the device in any of a variety of ways. In some embodiments, one or more additives are mixed or dispersed in one or more polymers comprising the body of the device, a layer of the body or a coating on the device when the polymer(s) are untangled or lack form or crystalline structure, which can promote interaction or incorporation of the additive(s) with the polymer molecules. Substantially amorphous polymers or semi crystalline polymers or polymers of lower crystallinity can have higher loading of additives, which can result in greater increase in strength and/or toughness and/or lower creep. In some embodiments, one or more reinforcement additives are mixed or dispersed in one or more polymers comprising the body of the device, a layer of the body or a coating on the device such that the polymer(s) contact or wet the surface of the additive(s), which can help to transfer stress from the polymer(s) to the additive(s) and increase the strength of the polymeric material. In certain embodiments, the additive(s) are substantially completely or substantially uniformly dispersed in the polymer(s), which can prevent or minimize aggregation of the additive(s) and disperse stress. Chemical modification of additives can prevent the additives from aggregating, improve dispersion of the additives in solvents (e.g., water, organic solvents), improve dispersion of the additives in polymers, and improve interaction between the additives and polymers. For example, modification of additives can create stronger interaction between the additives and polymers, which can increase the strength and toughness of the resulting material. Non-limiting examples of modifications of additives include acid treatment, base treatment, plasma treatment, oxidation (e.g., with oxygen), functionalization of a functional group (e.g., an amino, hydroxyl or carboxyl group), and conjugation to a polymer, e.g., polyethylene glycol, poly(propionylethylenimine-co-ethylenimine) As an example, the surface of carbon nanotubes can be functionalized with carboxyl, hydroxyl, amino, amide, fluoro, alkyl, and/or other groups. Further, the surface of carbon nanotubes can be conjugated to poly(m-phenylenevinylene) having octyloxy chains, polyethylene glycol, poly(propionylethylenimine-co-ethyleneimine), polyethyleneimine, and/or other polymers, which can prevent aggregation of the nanotubes and improve dispersion of the nanotubes in a solvent or a polymeric material comprising the body of the device or a coating on the device. The manner in which an additive is mixed with a polymer in a solvent (which can be a mixture of solvents) can influence how uniformly dispersed in the polymer the additive is. Non-limiting examples of solvents that can be used to dissolve, suspend or disperse additives include amide-containing solvents, dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, ketones, acetone, ethers, tetrahydrofuran, halogenated solvents, dichloromethane, chloroform, Freon, Freon substitutes, monochlorobenzene, alcohols, ethanol, and methanol. In certain embodiments, an additive is slowly added (e.g., in increments or dropwise) to a solvent that may or may not contain a polymer. To aid dissolution, suspension or dispersion of the additive in the solvent, the mixture can be stirred, shaken or vortexed. The mixture can also be subjected to a relatively high RPM mixer or centrifuge, and/or exposed to ultrasound energy (homogenizer or bath). In certain embodiments, the mixture is exposed to ultrasound having a frequency no more than about 45 kHz, 35 kHz, 25 KHz or 15 kHz. An anionic, cationic or non-ionic surfactant can be used to aid dissolution, suspension or dispersion of an additive in a solvent. Non-limiting examples of such surfactants include polyvinylpyrrolidone, polystyrenesulfonate and polyallylamine hydrochloride, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, sodium lauryl sulfate, ethoxylated castor oil, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl butyral, poly(oxy-1,2-ethanediyl), Tween surfactants (e.g., Tween 20, Tween 60), Pluronic surfactants (e.g., Pluronic F127, Pluronic L61, Pluronic L92), Triton surfactants (e.g., Triton X-100, Triton X-405), Igepal surfactants (e.g., Igepal CO-720, Igepal CO-890), and derivatives and adducts thereof. In certain embodiments, the amount of a surfactant relative to the weight of an additive is about 0.1% or 0.5% to about 20%, or about 0.1% or 0.5% to about 10%, or about 0.5% or 1% to about 7.5%, or about 0.5% or 1% to about 5%. A solution or mixture containing one or more reinforcement additives and one or more polymers can be applied to a structure (e.g., a substantially cylindrical structure, such as a mandrel) by spraying or dipping to form a polymeric article (e.g., a polymeric tube) or a layer of the polymeric article, or can be applied by spraying or dipping to form a coating on a device (e.g., a stent). Alternatively, such a solution or mixture can optionally be filtered and then can be concentrated (e.g., by evaporation or in vacuo) to provide a material that can be used to form a polymeric article (e.g., a polymeric tube) by extrusion, 3-D printing or molding (e.g., injection molding or compression molding). The polymeric article can undergo any treatments described herein (e.g., longitudinal extension, radial expansion, heating, pressurizing, vacuuming, or exposure to radiation or carbon dioxide, or a combination thereof), which can control or improve characteristics (e.g., crystallinity, strength, toughness, residual/internal stress, and/or degradation) of the material comprising the polymeric article. A device (e.g., a stent) can be formed from the polymeric article (e.g., polymeric tube) by any suitable method (e.g., laser cutting). In some embodiments, one or more reinforcement additives are mixed with or dispersed in one or more polymers having an adjustable or controllable Tg in the body of the device, a layer of the body or a coating on the device. In certain embodiments, the Tg of a polymer mixed with a reinforcement additive is substantially similar to the Tg of the polymer not mixed with the additive (e.g., as a result of a lack of chemical interaction between the polymer and the additive). Physical interaction between a polymer and an additive can be maximized, without chemical interaction between the polymer and the additive, e.g., by having the polymer wrap around (e.g., helically) the additive. In other embodiments, the Tg of a polymer mixed with a reinforcement additive is higher than the Tg of the polymer not mixed with the additive, which can be a result of chemical interaction (e.g., non-covalent interaction, such as van der Waals interaction or hydrogen boding) between the polymer and the additive. In yet other embodiments, the Tg of a polymer mixed with a reinforcement additive is lower than the Tg of the polymer not mixed with the additive, which can be a result of a lack of chemical interaction between the polymer and the additive and/or a lack of void or free surface between the polymer and the additive. In additional embodiments, one or more reinforcement additives incorporated in the body of the device, a layer of the body or a coating on the device are oriented in a substantially similar direction. In certain embodiments, the additive(s) are oriented in a direction of stress (e.g., radial direction), which can enhance the tensile modulus, stiffness and/or yield strength of the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of the device or a coating on the device. Orientation of the additive(s) can be promoted by electric or magnetic field before the material becomes hardened, and can be controlled by temperature and shear stress (e.g., longitudinal or radial). Orientation of the additive(s) can also be promoted by spinning a substantially cylindrical structure (e.g., a mandrel) in the direction of desired orientation while applying a solution or mixture of polymer(s) and the additive(s) onto the mandrel by spraying or dipping. The biodegradable implantable device can be any of a wide variety of implantable devices, and can be implanted in a subject for treatment of a wide variety of diseases, disorders and conditions. In some embodiments, the device substantially completely degrades within about 4 years, or within about 3 years, or within about 2 years, or within about 1 year, or within about 6 months in aqueous condition at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. In an embodiment, the device substantially completely degrades within about 2 years in aqueous condition at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. In one embodiment, the biodegradable stent material degrades substantially within 2 years, preferably within 1 year, more preferably within 9 months. In one embodiment, the biodegradable polymeric stent materials degrades by at least bulk erosion, surface erosion, or combination thereof. In one embodiment, the biodegradable polymeric stent material degrades by at least hydrolytic degradation, enzymatic degradation, oxidative degradation, photo degradation, degradation under physiological environment or combination thereof. In some embodiments, the biodegradable device described herein substantially completely degrades within about 48 months, or within about 42 months, or within about 36 months, or within about 30 months, or within about 24 months, or within about 18 months, or within about 12 months, or within about 9 months, or within about 6 months, or within about 3 months in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. In an embodiment, the device substantially completely degrades within about two years in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. In certain embodiments, the device substantially completely degrades within about 24 months, 18 months, 12 months, 9 months or 6 months, and the body of the device is comprised of the biodegradable copolymer and an additional biodegradable polymer and/or a non-degradable polymer, wherein degradation of at least one of the polymers (homopolymer or copolymer) is promoted in the presence of the other polymers. For example, degradation of at least one of the polymers (e.g., a lactide-, glycolide- or caprolactone-containing homopolymer or copolymer) can provide an acidic or basic by-product (e.g., lactic acid, glycolic acid or caproic acid) that promotes degradation of at least one of the other polymers. Without limiting to any mechanisms of action, it is believed that certain levels of inflammation are related to the pH of the degradation by products of the biodegradable devices and biodegradable polymers described herein. In some embodiments, the pH of lactic acid produced from lactide based polymers is about 3 to about 5 and the pH of glycolic acid produced from glycolide based polymers is from about 2 to about 5. In some preferred embodiments, the pH of the by products produced from the degradation of the biodegradable devices and biodegradable polymers is about 2 to about pH 7 and in certain other embodiments the pH is acidic and is higher than about 5. Following in vivo implantation of the implantable device, prosthesis, and articles described herein, the following semi-quantitative scores may be obtained to determine the effect of the device, prosthesis, or article—injury score, inflammation score, fibrin score, endothelialization score, and neointimal immaturity score. Such scores are obtained following examination of suitable tissue samples under a light microscope. Such scores may be related to the acid degradation by products of the material (e.g., polymeric material). The injury score is related to the laceration of the internal elastic lamina, the inflammation score is related to the amount of inflammatory cells at the implant location, fibrin score is related to the amount of fibrin, endothelialization score is related to the % of artery circumference covered by endothelium, and the neointimal immaturity score is related to the neointimal containing hypocellular areas. In preferred embodiments, following implantation the implantable device, prosthesis, and articles described herein provide low or medium scores for the injury score, inflammation score, fibrin score, endothelialization score, and neointimal immaturity score. For example, if the scoring scheme is 0 for no inflammation and 3 for high inflammation, it is preferred to have a mean score or 0, 1, or 2, or 2.5. Such inflammation scores, in some embodiments, are maintained for the entire period of use. Also, in some embodiments, the inflammation scores are maintained at 7 day or less, or 28 day or less, or about 60 day or less, or about 90 day or less. In some embodiments, the device decreases in mass by about 50% or more within about 24 months, or within about 18 months, or within about 12 months, or within about 9 months, or within about 6 months, or within about 3 months in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. In an embodiment, the device decreases in mass by about 50% or more within about one year in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. In additional embodiments, the average mass loss of the device, or the average mass loss of the material comprising the body of the device, or the average mass loss of the material comprising a coating on the device, is about 0.05% per day to about 3% per day, or about 0.075% per day to about 2% per day, or about 0.1% per day to about 1% per day, or about 0.14% per day to about 1.1% per day, or about 0.1% per day to about 0.75% per day, or about 0.15% per day to about 0.8% per day, or about 0.14% per day to about 0.6% per day, or about 0.2% per day to about 0.6% per day, or about 0.25% per day to about 0.5% per day. In an embodiment, the average mass loss of the device is about 0.14% per day to about 0.6% per day. Degradation of the body of the device and/or a coating on the device may occur in multiple phases, such as a slower degradation rate in one phase and a faster degradation rate in another phase. In some embodiments, the body of the device and/or a coating on the device degrade at a slower rate in an initial phase and at a faster rate in a later phase. In other embodiments, the body of the device and/or a coating on the device degrade at a faster rate in an initial phase and at a slower rate in a later phase. Degradation may be uniform along or throughout the body of the device and/or a coating on the device, or may be variable along or throughout the body of the device and/or a coating on the device. Degradation of the device can be controlled by any of a variety of ways. As an example, the body of the device can be comprised of a polymer that has a weight-average molecular weight of a certain value or in a certain range of values. For example, using a polymer of lower weight-average molecular weight can result in shorter degradation time. As another example, the body of the device can comprise a polymer, e.g., poly(L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone), and/or a coating on the device can comprise a polymer, e.g., poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide)], that is amorphous, hydrophilic or water-permeable to promote degradation of the body and/or the coating. As a further example, the body of the device and/or a coating on the device can comprise a more crystalline polymer, e.g., poly(L-lactide), that absorbs less water over time to slow down degradation of the body and/or the coating. As yet another example, the body of the device and/or a coating on the device can comprise one or more additives that promote absorption of water, react with water or promote hydrolysis of the material(s), e.g., polymeric material(s), comprising the body and/or the coating, which can promote degradation of the body and/or the coating. As a further example, the body of the device and/or a coating on the device can comprise one or more additives that reduce water absorption or act as a water barrier, which can slow down degradation of the body and/or the coating. Furthermore, the body of the device can comprise features in and/or on the body, and/or a coating on the device can comprise features in and/or on the coating, which promote degradation of the body and/or the coating. Examples of degradation-promoting features include without limitation openings, pores (including partial pores and through pores), holes (including partial holes and through holes), voids, recesses, pits, cavities, trenches, reservoirs and channels. Such features can allow water to penetrate into the body and/or the coating, and/or can collect water and any degradation by-product(s), e.g., acidic or basic by-product(s) of degradation of polymer(s), to promote degradation of the polymer(s) and any metal(s) or metal alloy(s) comprising the body and/or the coating. Additional examples of degradation-promoting features include corrosion-inducing features described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/398,363. In some embodiments, the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of an endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) substantially degrades within about 2 years, or within about 1.5 years, or within about 1 year, or within 9 months, or within about 6 months, or within about 3 months in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. In additional embodiments, an endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent) comprised of a biodegradable polymeric material substantially completely degrades within about 4 years, or within about 3.5 years, or within about 3 years, or within about 2.5 years, or within about 2 years, or within about 1.5 years, or within about 1 year, or within about 9 months, or within about 6 months, or within about 3 months in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. In an embodiment, the endoprosthesis (e.g., stent) substantially completely degrades within about two years in aqueous condition (e.g., in aqueous solution, water, saline solution or physiological conditions) at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. The material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising the body of an endoprosthesis (e.g., a stent), and the material (e.g., polymeric material) comprising any coating on the endoprosthesis, can degrade by bulk erosion and/or surface erosion.

The stent at body temperature is capable to expand from a crimped configuration to a deployed configuration with sufficient strength to support a body lumen. Optionally, the biodegradable polymeric material is treated at least by heat at a temperature above Tg, preferably between Tg-50° C. above Tg, after patterning for a time period ranging from 10 seconds to 5 hours (at a diameter that is substantially the same as the formed diameter, or at a diameter that is substantially the same as the patterned diameter, or at a diameter that is greater than the nominal deployment diameter of the stent), before crimping to a smaller diameter as described above. An example is a biodegradable stent comprising a polymeric material formed optionally into a tubular body wherein the polymeric material comprises lactide-co-caprolactone (or a blend of lactide and caprolactone). The tubular body is formed optionally by spraying the polymeric material onto a mandrel. DCM (or other suitable solvent capable of dissolving completely the polymeric material) is incorporated into the solution such that the amount of DCM after treatment is less than 1.5% by weight of the polymeric material. The tubular body is treated by heating at a temperature above Tg of the polymeric material for a time period ranging from 10 seconds to 5 hours, and/or cooling at a temperature below Tg of the polymeric material, is patterned at substantially the same diameter as the formed diameter, and is crimped onto a delivery system at a temperature below Tg of the polymeric material. The stent at body temperature (about 37° C.) is expandable from the crimped configuration to an expanded diameter that is 1.2 times the nominal deployment diameter (labeled diameter) of the stent without fracture and having sufficient strength to support a body lumen. In another embodiment, the tubular polymeric material is treated substantially without increasing the outer diameter of the tubular material or without substantially changing the diameter of the tube; before patterning or after patterning. In another embodiment, the polymeric tube is treated to increase the inner diameter of the tubular polymeric material without substantially increasing the outer diameter of the polymeric tube or without increasing the outer diameter of the tubular body.

The stent at body temperature is capable to expand from a crimped configuration to an expanded configuration and have sufficient strength to support a body lumen. For example, a 4.00 mm outer diameter and 3.70 mm inner diameter polymeric tube comprising 85:15 poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) formed by extrusion, spraying, dipping, or the like. This tube is placed inside a metal (or glass) mold with approximately 4.0 mm diameter cylindrical hole (inner diameter of the mold), (or optionally 4.0 mm inner diameter mold, or optionally less than 4.0 mm ID mold, or optionally 4.1 mm ID mold, or optionally a mold ID with 0.9-1.15 times the formed OD of the polymeric material, or optionally a mold ID with 0.9-1.1, times the formed OD of the polymeric material). The mold optionally could be composed of two halves for ease of tube placement and removal. The mold and/or the polymeric material is heated to above the polymeric material Tg. The ID of the polymeric material is pressurized at pressure(s) ranging from 100 psi to 5000 psi in a fraction of a second to 5 minutes, and the polymeric material is optionally stretched by an amount ranging from 10% to 500% of the polymeric material length in a time ranging from a fraction of a second to 5 minutes. The polymeric material is optionally cooled at a temperature below Tg in a time ranging from a fraction of a second to 50 minutes. The compressed polymeric tubing with approximately 4.00 mm outer diameter (+/−0.1 mm) and an inner diameter ranging from 3.8 to approximately 3.6 mm inner diameter is then removed. The wall of the polymeric tube in this example is compressed approximately 0.0005″. The modified tube is is patterned at substantially the same diameter, and subsequently coated with a drug or drug-polymer and subsequently crimped onto a delivery system at a temperature below Tg of the polymeric material and then sterilized. The stent at body temperature (about 37° C.) is expandable from the crimped configuration to an expanded diameter having sufficient strength to support a body lumen. In another embodiment, the stent at body temperature is expandable from a crimped configuration to an expanded configuration and have sufficient strength to support a body lumen wherein the stent expands further in the body lumen to a diameter larger than the deployed diameter of the stent. In another embodiment, the stent at body temperature is expandable from a crimped configuration to an expanded configuration and have sufficient strength to support a body lumen after an inward recoil of less than 15% (or between 1% and 15% inward recoil, or between 2%-10%) from the expanded configuration wherein the stent further expands in the body to a diameter larger than the deployed diameter (or expanded configuration) of the stent. The further expansion of the stent diameter or area or volume by at least 5%, by at least 10%, or by at least 15% larger than the deployed diameter. The further expansion of the scaffold in the body lumen occurs after deployment in the body, within 7 days, within 30 days, within 6 months, within 1 year, or within 2 years of the deployment of the stent in the body. In another embodiment, the stent at body temperature is expandable from a crimped configuration to an expanded configuration and have sufficient strength to support a body lumen after an inward recoil of less than 15% (or between 1% and 15% inward recoil, or between 2%-10%) from the expanded configuration wherein the stent further expands in the body to a diameter larger than the deployed diameter (or expanded configuration) of the stent and wherein the lumen further expands to a diameter (or area or volume) larger than lumen diameter (or area or volume) at deployment. The further expansion of the lumen diameter or area or volume is by at least 5%, by at least 10%, or by at least 15% larger than the lumen diameter or area or volume at deployment. The further expansion of the body lumen occurs after deployment of the stent in the body, within 7 days, within 30 days, within 6 months, within 1 year, or within 2 years after the deployment of the stent in the body. The stent and body lumen diameter or area or volume can be measured by QCA, IVUS, OCT, or MSCT.

When the device is a stent, the stent can have any pattern and design suitable for its intended use. The stent can be implanted in a subject for treatment of a wide variety of conditions, including obstruction or narrowing of a vessel (e.g., blood vessel) or other tubular tissue or organ in the body. In certain embodiments, the biodegradable stent exhibits a percentage radially inward recoil of about 20% or less, or of about 15% or less, or of about 10% or less, or of about 8% or less, or of about 6% or less, upon deployment or after deployment of the stent, or at any time ranging from about day 0 to about day 30 after deployment in aqueous condition at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. In an embodiment, the stent exhibits percent recoil of about 10% or less after deployment, or after radial expansion in aqueous condition at about 37° C. in vitro or in vivo. The stents can have any pattern and design suitable for their intended use. For example, the stents can comprise serpentine rings connected to one another directly or via links, have open cells or closed cells, comprise helical ring(s), comprise coil(s), comprise corrugated rings, have a slide-and-lock design, be a slotted tube, be a rolled sheet, or a combination thereof. Furthermore, the stents can have supporting features, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/016,077 and U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/885,700, the full disclosure of each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Moreover, the stents can have openings in the struts, crowns and/or links, as described in U.S. 60/885,700. To help determine the position of a stent in the body of a subject, the stent can have a radiopaque marker at any suitable position, e.g., at the proximal end and the distal end of the stent, and optionally in an intermediate portion of the stent. Alternatively or in addition, the body of the stent or a layer of the body, and/or a coating on the stent, can contain a radiopaque agent or material. In some embodiments, biodegradable implantable devices have substantially W-shaped cells. In certain embodiments, stents having substantially W-shaped cells have the stent pattern shown in FIG. 1 or a substantially similar pattern. The stent pattern in FIG. 1 is in an “as cut” state. The stent pattern in FIG. 1 comprises a plurality of intermediate cylindrical rings between the cylindrical ring at the proximal end and the cylindrical ring at the distal end of the stent, each cylindrical ring comprising a plurality of struts and a plurality of crowns connecting immediately adjacent struts which form a substantially sinusoidal pattern of alternating peaks and troughs, wherein immediately adjacent intermediate cylindrical rings are connected to one another at crowns via a plurality of links, and wherein: immediately adjacent intermediate cylindrical rings and links define a plurality of substantially W-shaped cells; each substantially W-shaped cell not immediately adjacent to the cylindrical ring at the proximal or distal end abuts six other substantially W-shaped cells; and the perimeter of each substantially W-shaped cell includes 8 struts, 10 crowns and 2 links. In some embodiments, each substantially W-shaped cell immediately adjacent to the cylindrical ring at the proximal end of the stent, and/or each substantially W-shaped cell immediately adjacent to the cylindrical ring at the distal end, does not abut six other substantially W-shaped cells. In certain embodiments, none of the substantially W-shaped cells immediately adjacent to the cylindrical ring at the proximal end of the stent, and/or none of the substantially W-shaped cells immediately adjacent to the cylindrical ring at the distal end, abuts six other substantially W-shaped cells. In the stent pattern of FIG. 1, the links connecting immediately adjacent intermediate cylindrical rings are substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the stent. In other embodiments, the links are oriented at an angle (e.g., about 1 degree to about 45 degrees, or about 5 degrees to about 35 degrees, or about 10 degrees to about 25 degrees) relative to the longitudinal axis of the stent. In FIG. 1, crowns of an intermediate cylindrical ring which are not connected to a crown of an immediately adjacent intermediate cylindrical ring via a link are substantially curved, except that certain crowns of the intermediate cylindrical ring immediately adjacent to the proximal end and certain crowns of the intermediate cylindrical ring immediately adjacent to the distal end which are not connected to a crown of the respective immediately adjacent intermediate cylindrical ring via a link are substantially flat. Crowns of an intermediate cylindrical ring which are connected to a crown of an immediately adjacent intermediate cylindrical ring via a link are substantially flat. In other embodiments, crowns of an intermediate cylindrical ring which are not connected to a crown of an immediately adjacent intermediate cylindrical ring via a link are substantially flat, and crowns of an intermediate cylindrical ring which are connected to a crown of an immediately adjacent intermediate cylindrical ring via a link are substantially curved. In yet other embodiments, all crowns of intermediate cylindrical rings are substantially curved. In still other embodiments, all crowns of intermediate cylindrical rings are substantially flat. In certain embodiments, immediately adjacent struts of intermediate cylindrical rings are oriented relative to one another at an interior angle of about 90 degrees to about 150 degrees, or about 100 degrees to about 140 degrees, or about 110 degrees to about 130 degrees, when the stent is in a non-deformed configuration (e.g., the as cut state). In an embodiment, immediately adjacent struts of intermediate cylindrical rings are oriented relative to one another at an interior angle of about 120 degrees when the stent is in a non-deformed configuration (e.g., the as cut state). In some embodiments, the interior angle of immediately adjacent struts connected by a substantially curved crown is substantially similar to the interior angle of immediately adjacent struts connected by a substantially flat crown when the stent is in a non-deformed configuration (e.g., the as cut state) or in a deformed configuration (e.g., crimped or radially expanded).

The following examples are provided merely to illustrate the present disclosure and are not intended to limit the scope of the disclosure. Example 1 Stent Fabrication A. Patterning and Coating a Stent A 14 mm stent having a selected pattern (e.g., that of FIG. 1) was cut from a polymeric tube using a laser. The outer diameter (OD) of the stent was about 0.142 inch, and the thickness of the struts, crowns and links of the stent was about 0.006 inch. A solution containing a polymer, e.g., 85:15 poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide), and a drug (e.g., myolimus) in a weight ratio of about 3:2 and at a combined concentration of about 1.7 mg/mL in a solvent (e.g., dichloromethane) was sprayed onto the stent to form a coating on the stent containing a wet weight of the polymer and the drug of about 270 μg. The stent was put under vacuum at ambient temperature for at least 36 hours to remove, e.g., any residual solvent, yielding a dryer coating weight of about 130-150 μg. The coated stent was then heated at 70° C. for 15 minutes to stabilize the coating on the stent and remove any additional residual solvent, yielding a coating weight of about 125-135 μg. The average thickness of the coating was less than 5 microns. B. Sterilizing the Stent The stent delivery system (crimped stent mounted onto the balloon-catheter) was packaged in a pouch and sterilized by exposure to e-beam radiation (30 kGy total dose with the stent being exposed to an internal dose of about 22.5 kGy). C. Physical Properties of the Stent Physical properties of stents (having the pattern of FIG. 1) and polymeric tubes made of poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) homopolymer or one of various poly(L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) [poly(LLA-co-CL)] copolymers were measured. Radial strength, stiffness and % recoil of uncoated stents were measured after the stents were heated at 70° C. for 15 minutes and crimped without sterilization or after the stents were heated at 70° C. for 15 minutes, crimped and then sterilized. The % crystallinity, glass transition temperature (Tg), crystallization enthalpy (ΔHc) and melting enthalpy (ΔHm) of the polymeric material composing a tube having no coating were measured after the tube was heated at 70° C. for 15 minutes without sterilization or after the tube was heated at 70° C. for 15 minutes and then sterilized. Percent recoil was measured according to the procedures described in the ASTM F 2079-09 document entitled “Standard Test Method for Measuring Intrinsic Elastic Recoil of Balloon-Expandable Stents”. Radial strength and stiffness were measured according to the procedures described in the draft ASTM WK15227 document entitled “Standard Practice/Guide for Measuring Radial Strength of Balloon-Expandable and Self-Expandable Vascular Stents”, adapted such that the stent was characterized under physiological conditions. The Tg, crystallization enthalpy and melting enthalpy were measured according to the procedures described in the ASTM D3418-08 document entitled “Standard Test Method for Transition Temperatures and Enthalpies of Fusion and Crystallization of Polymers by Differential Scanning calorimetry”. H. Qin et al., Macromolecules, 37:5239-5249 (2004) also discuss crystallization enthalpies during first heating and first cooling. Percent crystallinity by weight was measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Briefly, a sample was flattened in a die and hydraulic press prior to measurement and then was placed on a zero-background silicon sample holder. Scans were run on a Panalytical X'pert MPD Pro diffractometer using copper radiation at 45 KV/40 mA and covering the range of 5 degrees to 70 degrees with a step size of 0.02 degree and a counting time of 500 seconds per step. Results of the measurements are shown in Table 2 below. Sterilization with e-beam had a greater effect on the % crystallinity of the polymeric material [90:10 poly(LLA-co-CL) or 95:5 poly(LLA-co-CL)] composing a polymeric tube than on its Tg. The stents made of 70:30 poly(LLA-co-CL) or 85:15 poly(LLA-co-CL) exhibited the lowest radial strength and stiffness. Without intending to be bound by theory, a possible reason for the low recoil of the stents made of 70:30 poly(LLA-co-CL) or 85:15 poly(LLA-co-CL) is that those stents may have a greater self-expandable character and hence may have an enhanced tendency to expand to the larger diameter of the polymeric tube from which the stent was cut.

The stents were made using procedures substantially similar to those described in this Example. Radial strength, stiffness and % recoil of uncoated stents were measured after the stents were heated at 70° C. for 15 minutes (the step for stabilizing a coating on a stent in this Example), crimped and then sterilized with e-beam radiation.

Compositions of Polymeric Tubes and Coatings Using procedures substantially similar to those described above in this Example, polymeric tubes having a variety of compositions (e.g., polymers, drugs and/or additives; see Table 4) were made and coatings containing various compositions (see Table 5) were applied to stents cut from polymeric tubes.

A polymeric tube was made by spraying the polymer and drug solution onto a mandrel rotating at 80 rpm and moving longitudinally at a rate of 0.050 inch/min. The resulting tube had a thickness of about 0.21 mm prior to heat and vacuum treatments. The tube was subjected to reduced pressure, heated under reduced pressure, annealed, and then cooled to ambient temperature. The thickness of the tube was about 0.18 mm after the heat and vacuum treatments. A stent having the pattern of FIG. 4 (shown in a crimped state) was cut from the annealed tube using a UV laser. The stent was crimped and mounted onto a balloon-catheter. The resulting stent delivery system was packaged in a pouch and sterilized by exposure to e-beam radiation (30 kGy total dose). The radial strength of the stent after laser cutting, after crimping, after e-beam sterilization, or after radial expansion at the Tg of the poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) copolymer, with heat treatment (annealing) or without heat treatment of the polymeric tube from which the stent was cut, was tested at 37° C. in saline solution. The results are shown in Table 6 below. In each test scenario, the stent cut from an annealed tube (“heat-treated stent”) exhibited higher radial strength than the stent cut from a non-annealed tube (“non-heat-treated stent”).

The MWCNTs had substantially similar physical dimensions as the MWCNTs described in this Example. The stents were made according to procedures substantially similar to those described in this Example and had the pattern of FIG. 1. Radial strength, stiffness and % recoil of the stents were measured after they were heated at 70° C., crimped, mounted on a balloon, and sterilized with e-beam. The stents exhibited a mean radial strength of 22.8 psi, mean stiffness of 1.3 N/mm2, and a mean % recoil of 4.8%. Example 3 Analysis of Residual/Internal Stress of Stents Cut from Polymeric Tubes Made by Spraying Stents having the pattern of FIG. 1 were laser cut from polymeric tubes made by spraying. To analyze residual/internal stress in the uncoated, as-cut stents, the stents were exposed in ambient environment to a temperature at about the Tg or about 20° C. above the Tg of the polymeric material composing the body of the stent. The amount of shrinkage of the stents as measured by % change in length and % change in outer diameter (OD) was measured over a period of 1 hour or 24 hours (Table 8). Without using any prior stabilization treatment (e.g., heating and pre-shrinkage), the stents exhibited reduction in length and/or OD of no more than 5%, which suggests that the stents cut from polymeric tubes made by spraying had minimal residual/internal stress.

The stents in the studies comprised PLLA, PLLAPGA, PLLAPCL, Poly (L lactide-co-Glycolide) and poly(L lactide-co-caprolactone). At least one of the studies is described below. The nominal drug dose in the coating on the 14 mm length stent is 40 μg of Myolimus and coating is poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide). The purpose of the studies are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the polymeric degradable drug eluting stent after a period of 28±2 days and open ended timepoint (OE). The vascular response, including the arterial minimal lumen diameter and percent stenosis, will be evaluated in all vessels using quantitative vessel angiography (QCA) at 28±2 days and at an OE endpoint with a follow up procedure at 90±3 days, 180±5 days and 270±14 days. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will also be performed at these time points to assess stent apposition and recoil. Additionally, histopathologic analysis of the coronary arteries will be performed at 28±2 days and the OE timepoint to evaluate the cellular response to the stents. Another purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of the released drug at 3 days, 7 days, 28±2 days, and longer timepoints; drug release will be assessed by analysis of the drug remaining on the stents and uptake of the drug by the tissue. In addition, the polymer degradation is also evaluated by evaluating the molecular weight of the polymer remaining on the stent. The product size of 3.0×14 mm is used in the study. A nonatherosclerotic swine model was chosen. Hybrid farm pigs (Landrance-Yorkshire) were selected for use in studies up to 90 days in length and Yucatan Mini Swine were selected for use in the 180 day and longer term studies due to starting size and growth expectations. When possible, stents are implanted in the 3 coronary arteries (left circumflex artery [LCx], left anterior descending artery [LAD] and right coronary artery [RCA]), and in the left and right internal mammary arteries (IMAs) per animal. Upon assignment to the study and until sacrifice, animals will be monitored and observed at least twice a day. To prevent or reduce the occurrence of thrombotic events, animals are treated daily, with acetylsalicylic acid (325 mg, per os [PO]) and clopidogrel (300 mg on the first day and 75 mg daily afterwards, PO), beginning at least 3 days before intervention and continuing until sacrifice. The drugs will be crushed to powder and mixed with their food; therefore, treatment will not be administered when animals are fasted. Fasting (food, including any dietary supplements) will be conducted the morning prior to interventional procedures and scheduled sacrifice. Water will not be withheld. Animals will be tranquilized with ketamine, azaperone and atropine administered intramuscularly [IM]. Animal weight will be recorded. Anesthesia induction will be achieved with propofol injected intravenously [IV]. Upon induction of light anesthesia, the subject animal will be intubated and supported with mechanical ventilation. Isoflurane in oxygen will be administered to maintain a surgical plane of anesthesia. Intravenous fluid therapy will be initiated and maintained throughout the procedure. The rate may be increased to replace blood loss or to correct low systemic blood pressure. To prevent postoperative infection, animals will be given prophylactic antibiotic Draxxin® IM. Additional doses may be administered as deemed appropriate. In order to prevent pain sensitization and minimize postoperative pain, Torbugesic (butorphanol) will be administered IM as preemptive analgesia. After induction of anesthesia, the left or right femoral artery will be accessed through an incision made in the inguinal region. Bupivacain IM will be infiltrated into the femoral access site to achieve local anesthesia and manage pain after surgery. An arterial sheath will be introduced and advanced into the artery. An initial heparin bolus will be administered and ACT will be measured at least every 30 minutes and recorded. The device will not be introduced until ACT is confirmed to be >300 seconds. If ACT is <300 seconds, additional heparin will be administered. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a guiding catheter will be inserted through the sheath (6F) and advanced to the appropriate location. After placement of the guiding catheter, nitroglycerin will be delivered to achieve vasodilatation and angiographic images of the vessel will be obtained with contrast media to identify the proper location for the deployment site (designated pre-stent angiographies). A segment of coronary artery will be chosen and a guidewire will be inserted into the chosen artery. QCA will be performed at this time to document the reference diameter for stent placement. OCT will be performed before implantation to confirm vessel sizing at three locations per coronary vessel. Stent Deployment Procedures: The stent will be introduced into the selected artery (diameter range of 2.6 to 3.0 mm if possible) by advancing the delivery system through the guiding catheter, over the guide wire to the deployment site. After the stent enters the guide catheter, there will be at least a one minute soak wait before deploying the stent. The stent will then be deployed. The balloon will be inflated at a slow rate: starting with 10 second intervals per atmosphere, bring the balloon to 2 atm. Further expansion completed at 3-5 second intervals for each subsequent atmosphere of pressure. This is approx. 40-50 seconds to nominal pressure. Final pressure is maintained for 20-30 seconds. An angiogram of the balloon at full inflation will be recorded (designated balloon angiography) and the inflation pressure will be noted. After the target stent to artery ratio has been achieved, vacuum will be slowly applied to the inflation device to deflate the balloon. Complete balloon deflation will be verified fluoroscopically. A second inflation may be conducted if a stent is not well apposed against arterial wall or if an animal is at risk. Injection of nitroglycerin will be repeated and a final angiogram of the treated vessel will be performed (designated post-stent angiography) to document device patency, and TIMI flow Implantation will be repeated in the other vessels. OCT will be performed on all animals to assess stent recoil. OCT will be performed before implantation to confirm vessel sizing at three locations per coronary vessel. After all implants are completed, OCT will be performed again for the same (first) stent, followed by every other stent implanted in the coronaries (designated end of implant OCT). Following the successful deployment of stents and completion of angiography, all catheters and the sheath will be removed from the animal and the femoral artery will be ligated. The incision will be closed in layers with appropriate suture materials. An antibiotic ointment will be applied to the wound. The fluoroscopic output from the stent implantation (pre-stent, balloon inflation, post-stent, and end of implant) and at explantation (final) was recorded in digital format. From these images, QCA measurements were obtained for the 28 day and 180 day cohort animals. QCA was also performed at the 90 day follow-up for the 180 day cohort animals. OCT imaging was performed in each animal after the first stent was implanted and after all implants had been completed. OCT was also performed prior to sacrifice on the 28 day Cohort of animals. OCT was performed at a 90 day follow-up on the 180 day cohort. Analysis of each vessel may include: qualitative evaluation for evidence of lumen narrowing (in-stent and marginal), migration, presence of dissection, presence of aneurysms, presences of thrombosis and TIMI flow. Elastin stained sections were examined using light microscopy, image capture, and quantitative morphometric computer-assisted methods. Several semi-quantitative parameters were employed to assess the biological response of vascular tissue to the stents by light microscopy examination of stained sections. Other organ samples were observed for any abnormal findings. Scores to describe vessel injury, inflammation, fibrin deposition, calcification and endothelialization were performed. Pharmacokinetics Analysis: The drug remaining on the stents was measured using an HPLC-UV analytical method for measuring the drug total content on stents. The drug tissue concentration in the explanted surrounding tissue (artery wall) as well as neointima containing some remaining stent struts (at later timepoints) were measured using a LC/MS bioanalytical method. Analytical method for determination of polymer Stent Mass and Molecular Weight: Polymer Stent Mass and molecular weight (MW) determination were conducted using Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). Results: FIG. 6 shows a typical series of OCT images from the implant. FIG. 7 shows the stent and lumen diameter at various time points. The acute and end of implant stent diameter were similar, indicating minimal recoil. The mean lumen diameter was at least maintained or increased over time. FIG. 8 depicts the method used to calculate % stenosis and FIG. 9 shows the observed % stenosis and it can be seen that the % stenosis was maintained to 270 d. Table 9 shows the histopathology results and FIG. 10 shows the vascular response up to 270 days. FIG. 11 shows the Pharmacokinetic results from the study. FIG. 12 shows the degradation of the implant—the trendline supports approximately 1-2 yr degradation by Mw. FIG. 12A shows in vivo sample degradation rate of biodegradable polymer stent material through 180 days and calculated degradation rate by MW and FIG. 12B shows in vivo sample degradation rate of biodegradable polymer stent material through 270 days and calculated degradation rate by MW.

Various other embodiments may be incorporated in these examples or other examples and are within the scope of the disclosed present invention. A. Processing of a Polymeric Stent Example 5A A stent is patterned from a tube formed using extrusion (or optionally using spraying, dip coating, molding, or 3D printing) from polylactide material, more preferably, Poly(L-lactide) (or optionally from a co-polymers such as Polylactide-co-polyglycolide or polylactide-co-polycaprolactone; or blends of polylactides, polyglycolides, and polycaprolactones; or combination thereof; in various polymer or co-polymer ratios such as 80:20 to 99:01). The tubular body has an initial inner diameter of about 0.5 mm (0.020″) but optionally can have an initial diameter ranging from about 0.25 mm (0.01″) to 2 mm (0.079″). The tube is treated by at least one of heat, pressure, and drawing at temperature above Tg of the material and below Tm for duration ranging from a fraction of a second to one hour to expand the tube to a second uniform inner diameter of about 3 mm (0.118″) which is about the diameter of the intended deployment diameter of a the stent when the stent is deployed to about 3 mm or to at least the intended deployment diameter when the stent is deployed to about 3 mm or above in this example (intended deployment diameter can also be the nominal labeled diameter of the stent or deploying balloon or the actual deployed diameter of the stent). Optionally, the second inner diameter of the tube or the stent can range from 0.9-1.5 times an intended deployment diameter of the stent. The tube or the stent is optionally treated by heating at about Tg or above Tg (for example 90° C.), ranging from a fraction of second to 24 hours when the tube is at the second inner diameter. Optionally a mandrel is inserted inside the tube while the heat treatment is applied and also optionally the tube is held into position over the mandrel to control shrinkage of the tube. The tube is cooled after heat treatment or optionally quenched quickly to a temperature below Tg or below the crystallization temperature or to ambient temperature or below ambient temperature. The tube is patterned into a stent at about the second inner diameter or optionally below the second inner diameter. The patterned stent is coated with the drug Novolimus (e.g. 5 micorgrams/mm) or optionally with a mixture of Novolimus and a polymer or co-polymer such as a PLLA polymer or PLLA-PGA co-polymer. The coated stent is optionally placed in a vacuum for a total of 36 hours and then crimped to a diameter smaller than the intended deployment diameter using a gradual heat (at about Tg or below Tg) and pressure or mechanical force from about 10 seconds to about 30 minutes. The stent is crimped onto the delivery system or optionally crimped and then mounted or fitted onto a delivery system such as a balloon catheter. After crimping, the stent delivery system is packaged in a sterile barrier (i.e., in a foil pouch) and can be sterilized by ebeam or ethylene oxide cycle. The mounted stent and delivery system in the example are sterilized using E-beam sterilization. The sterilized stent is subjected optionally to one additional treatment by heating the packaged stent to a temperature below Tg (example 30° C.) for a duration ranging from 1 minute to 7 days). The stent material Tg after treatment is above 35° C. and below 55° C. The crystallinity of the stent material after treatment ranges from about 0% to 60%. (Optionally the crystallinity after treatment can range from 0% to 30% or 0% to 40% or 0% to 55%). The stent is capable of radial expansion at body temperature and have sufficient radial strength to support a body lumen, or optionally 3 psi or greater. The stent optionally has recoil from an expanded condition of less than 10%. Other embodiments are: Example 5A.1 A stent prosthesis as in example A wherein the heat treatment of the tubular body or stent at about Tg or above Tg for a duration ranging from a fraction of a second to about 24 hours takes place when the tube diameter is 0.9-1.5 times the intended deployment diameter. Example 5A.2 A stent prosthesis as in example A wherein the heat treatment of the tubular body or stent at about Tg or above Tg for duration ranging from a fraction of a second to about 24 hours takes place when the tube diameter is 0.9-1.5 times the intended deployment diameter and optionally a treatment by heat of the tubular body below Tg takes place when the tube diameter is below 0.9 times the intended deployment diameter. Example 5A.3 A stent prosthesis as in example A wherein the heat treatment of the tubular body or stent when the tube diameter is 0.9-1.5 times the intended deployment diameter is always about Tg or below Tg for a duration ranging from a fraction of a second to about 24 hours. Example 5A.4 A stent prosthesis as in example A wherein the second inner diameter of the tube or the stent is 0.95-1.5 times an intended deployment diameter, or 1-1.5 times an intended deployment diameter, or 1.05-1.5 times an intended deployment diameter, or 1.1-1.5 times an intended deployment diameter. Example 5A.5 A stent prosthesis as in example A wherein the treatment by heat at about Tg or above Tg for the tube or stent when the diameter is 0.9-1.5 times an intended deployment diameter is for a short duration ranging from a fraction of a second to less than one hour, preferably from a fraction of a second to less than 30 minutes, and more preferably from a fraction of a second to less than 15 minutes. Example 6 Securing the Stent on Delivery System As a means to retain the stent on the balloon of a delivery catheter, a blockade-like bump on the proximal end, distal end or both ends of the stent can be formed on the balloon or part of the balloon (FIG. 2). The bump can be deflated partially or fully by means of a vacuum on the catheter lumen as part of the deflation port of the balloon or a separate/independent deflation port. The bumps deflate or shrink or become smaller upon inflation of the balloon or upon deflation of the balloon or upon pulling vacuum on the balloon or upon pulling vacuum on the separate bump port. The bump prevents or minimizes the movement of the stent during introduction and delivery of the stent to the lesion. Another means for retaining the stent is by the presence of a cap on the proximal end, distal end, or both ends of the stent. Each cap covers a portion of the stent, preferably from approximately 0.1 to 2 millimeter of the stent. The cap can be made from a solid tube, spongy tube, weave or braided tube, or laser cut tube with patterning, or a portion of the balloon material itself and affixed to one end of the catheter. The cap can fit snuggly or tightly around the stent. The inner diameter of the cap can be slightly larger than the crimped diameter of the stent, preferably same as the crimped diameter, and more preferably, smaller than the diameter of the crimp diameter. The remaining cap may cover the balloon material adjacent to the stent and may extend further to cover outer member (proximal cap) or the tip (distal cap) of the delivery catheter. The cap can have uniform diameter (inner diameter same throughout the length of the cap), it can have a larger inner diameter on the side where it covers the stent and smaller inner diameter on the side where it covers the outer member/tip of the delivery catheter. One or more exposed edges of the cap can be beveled. Preferably the cap is glued to the delivery catheter (affixed) when it is not in contact with the stent or balloon so as to prevent it from flowing away. Upon expansion of the balloon and ensuing expansion of the stent, the cap retracts or releases from the stent and at a certain balloon diameter, no longer covers the stent and allows the stent to expand freely. Another means for retaining the stent is the use of an adhesive such as waterproof permanent adhesive, non permanent adhesive, or solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, chloroform, or the like. The adhesive is applied on the balloon or catheter such that there is one or more tongue or groove formed within the adhesive mass. The tongue or groove can be the same or smaller than a stent feature such as a link, strut, marker tab or hole, crown, tab, flap or other which serves as the groove or tongue (reverse of the adhesive shape). The shape of the tongue or groove is dependent on the stent feature. The depth of the tongue or groove can be greater than the stent thickness, same as the stent thickness, or less than the stent thickness. The adhesive can be positioned at either or both end of the intended stent or elsewhere within the confines of the stent. A crimped stent is then placed onto the adhesive and the feature of the stent is snapped into the tongue or groove of the adhesive mass as a means to retain the stent. When the balloon is expanded, the stent feature snaps out of the groove. Another means for retaining the stent is the use of heat to heat seal the stent onto the balloon surface. A stent inside a sheath is inserted over the balloon. The stent is heated to about or below the Tg of the coating of the stent or the stent and then the balloon is pressurized causing the stent to be heat sealed to the balloon. In another means, the stent with or without a sheath on a balloon can be placed inside a heated crimper set at about or below the Tg of the coating on the stent or the stent and the crimper is allowed to closed. The balloon is pressured causing the stent to be heat sealed to the balloon. Stent coating can be such that the coating itself or an added top layer of coating is made from a material that has a lower Tg than the stent itself. Examples of such a layer can be made of 70:30 PLLA-co-CL or 85:15 PLLA-co-CL or higher ratios of CL, or PGA, PLLA-GA with higher ratio of GA, PDLLA, polymers with Tg at or below 55 degrees Celsius, or the like or combination thereof. Another means for retaining the stent is the use of an adhesive such as waterproof permanent adhesive or non permanent adhesive to affix an anchoring device. The anchoring device has a grooves or tongue that can be the same or smaller that a stent feature such as a link, strut, marker tab or hole, crown, tab, flap, or other groove or tongue (reverse of the anchor device). The shape of the tongue or groove is dependent on the stent feature. The depth of the tongue or groove can be greater than the stent thickness, same as the stent thickness, or less than the stent thickness. One or more anchoring device is snapped onto the stent feature or features. The stent can be crimped before or after attachment to the anchoring device. The stent is mounted over the balloon and the anchoring device is attached mechanically to the balloon or by use of adhesives or welding means. The anchoring device can have an elastic band which goes around the balloon as a means to be attached mechanically to the balloon. This band stretches as the balloon is expanded. As the stent and the band expand, the grip of the tongue or groove will release the stent. Another example of securing the stent is to apply or modify the surface of the catheter or balloon catheter is such a way to retain or hinder the stent from longitudinal movement upon delivery of the stent into a body lumen and allows the stent to expand or deploy in the body lumen at body temperature. Another example of securing the stent is to apply an adhesive to at least one side of the stent (abluminal or luminal) which when crimping the stent onto the catheter or the balloon catheter creates a bond sufficient to minimize or prevent the stent from moving in the longitudinal direction or expanding in the radial direction prior to active deployment by the operator. Another means to secure the stent on delivery system is to incorporate a sheath over the stent that is retracted to deploy the stent to an intended deployment diameter or to a partial deployment diameter below an intended deployment diameter. Example 7 Methods to Control Tg to a Desired Tg Between 35° C. to 50° C. or Above 37° C. to 45° C. To control Tg of stent material to allow expansion at body temperature or other desired temperatures. For example, a desired Tg between 35° C. and 50° C. to allow the stent to expand at body temperature can be achieved through one or more sequence of treatments to control the Tg starting from forming the tube to the final product where the desired Tg is achieved. A polymer or co-polymer tube such as PLLA-PCL or PLLA-PGA where the tube is formed using extrusion, spraying, dip coating, molding, or 3D printing and having a Tg after forming about 55° C. The tube is treated by at least one of heating, solvent removal or introduction, additive removal or introduction, pressurizing, stretching, vacuum, sterilization, and patterning, in a certain configuration or sequence to achieve a desired Tg for the stent material after treatment to be between 35° C. and 50° C. (optionally greater than 37° C. and below 45° C.) such that the stent is capable of radial expansion in a body lumen and have sufficient radial strength to support a body lumen. Another example is a stent with a transitional temperature, Tg, between 37° C. to 55° C.—one method to control the stent Tg is by using a copolymer, terpolymer, or the like for making the stent. For example, a copolymer made from 70:30 to 95:05 of L-lactide and epsilon-caprolactone molar ratios, can result in a stent having a range of Tg from 37° C. to 55° C., respectively. Another method is to fabricate tube using a heatless process such as dipping or spraying to form a tube. For example, a tube, which can be patterned into a stent, can be fabricated by dipping a mandrel onto a concentrated solution of material having a Tg less than 55° C. For example, a tube can be made by spraying a solution onto a mandrel. After dipping or spraying, the solvent is allowed to evaporate by vacuuming and or exposure to carbon dioxide at high pressures (such as 700 psi for 24 hours). The use of this heatless spraying or dipping process minimizes the formation of crystalline structures within the polymer, thereby resulting in the minimum possible Tg. Another method is to add one or more molecules into the polymer used to fabricate the stent. Molecules can be a solvent such as methylene chloride, DMSO, or others, plasticizers such as lactide, caprolactone, lactic acid, L-lactic acid, D-lactic acid, DL-lactic acid, p-dioxanone, epsilon-caprolic acid, alkylene oxalate, cycloalkylene oxalate, alkylene succinate, β-hydroxybutyrate, substituted or unsubstituted trimethylene carbonate, 1,5-dioxopan-2-one, 1,4-dioxepan-2-one, glycolide, glycolic acid, L-lactide, D-lactide, DL-lactide, meso-lactide, combination thereof, or others, low Tg polymers such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol, polyethylene oxide, castor oil, combination thereof, or others. A further method of controlling the Tg of the polymer is by processing such as heating, laser cutting, crimping, irradiation, or the like. Exposing the stent or tube used to pattern the stent to these processes can decrease or increase the Tg of the material. Examples of processing a tube or a stent at a diameter ranging from 0.9-1.5 times intended deployment diameter where the stent is expanded at temperature above 37° C. in a body lumen are shown below. A stent is patterned from a tube made from Poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) material, preferably having a lactide to glycolide comonomer ratio of 83:17 to 88:12. The tube can be formed by spraying. Before it is patterned into a stent, the tube has an inner diameter that is 90 to 150% of the intended stent deployment diameter. As a further example, for a 3 mm stent intended deployment diameter, the tube inner diameter can range from 2.7 millimeter (0.106″) to 4.5 millimeter (0.177″). Another example is for a 3.5 mm intended deployment diameter stent. The tube inner diameter can range from 3.15 millimeter (0.124″) to 5.25 millimeter (0.207″). The tube is heat treated optionally below Tg such as at 10° C. below the Tg for 30 minutes. Alternatively or optionally, the tube is heated above Tg ranging from a fraction of a second to 5 hours (for example at 90° C. for 1 hour). The Tg of the tube after heat treatment is between 30° C. to 55° C. (optionally between 35° C. to 55° C.). The tube is then patterned into a stent, coated with a drug matrix such as Poly(L-lactide) based copolymer and Novolimus. The coated stent is vacuumed for 36 hours at approximately 1 torr. The stent is then crimped at 45° C. (optionally between 30° C. and 45° C., or optionally lower than Tg) onto the balloon of a delivery catheter. The stent delivery system is packaged in a sterile barrier and sterilized by ebeam. After sterilization, the stent delivery system is optionally stabilized at 29° C. for 48 hours. Prior to or during stent deployment, the stent is heated to a temperature greater than 37° C. but below 50° C. (optionally above 37° C. and below 45° C.) to expand the stent to its intended deployment diameter. (Optionally by a heated catheter or balloon, RF balloon, heated contract agent injected into the artery, heated coil on the catheter shaft proximal to the balloon, or by other means). This provides sufficient radial strength to support a body lumen and/or have a recoil from an expanded state of less than 10%. Another example is a stent patterned from a tube made from Poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) material, preferably having a lactide to glycolide comonomer ratio of 80:20 to 95:05. The tube can be formed by spraying. Before it is patterned into a stent, the tube has an inner diameter that is 90 to 150% of the intended stent deployment diameter. As a further example, for a 3 mm stent, the tube inner diameter can range from 2.7 millimeter (0.106″) to 4.5 millimeter (0.177″). Another example is a 3.5 mm stent. The tube inner diameter can range from 3.15 millimeter (0.124″) to 5.25 millimeter (0.207″). The tube is heat treated below Tg for example at 10° C. below the Tg for 30 minutes. The Tg of the tube after treatment is between 35° C. to 55° C. The tube is then patterned into a stent, coated with a drug matrix such as Poly(L-lactide) based copolymer and Novolimus. The coated stent is vacuumed for 36 hours at approximately 1 torr. The stent is then crimped at 45° C. onto the balloon of a delivery catheter. The stent delivery system is packaged in a sterile barrier and sterilized by ebeam. After sterilization, the stent delivery system is optionally stabilized at 29° C. for 48 hours. The final stent material after treatment is substantially amorphous. Before or during stent deployment, the stent is heated to a temperature greater than 37° C. and below 50° C. (optionally above 37° C. and below 45° C.) to expand it to its intended deployment diameter by means such as a heated balloon, RF balloon, heated contract agent injected into the artery, heated coil on the catheter shaft proximal to the balloon, or by other means. The expanded stent has sufficient strength to support a body lumen and/or recoil from an expanded state of less than 10%. Another example is a stent is patterned from a tube made from Poly(L-lactide-co-caprolactone) material, preferably having a lactide to caprolactone ratio of 80:20 to 99:01. The tube can be formed by spraying. Before it is crimped, the tube has an inner diameter that is 90 to 150% of the intended stent deployment diameter. As a further example, for a 3 mm stent, the tube inner diameter can range from 2.7 millimeter (0.106″) to 4.5 millimeter (0.177″). Another example is a 3.5 mm stent. The tube inner diameter can range from 3.15 millimeter (0.124″) to 5.25 millimeter (0.207″). The tube is heat treated above Tg for example at 120° C. for 2 hours (optionally fraction of a second to 5 hours). The Tg of the tube after treatment is between 35° C. to 55° C. The tube is patterned into a stent, coated with a drug matrix such as Poly(L-lactide) based copolymer and Novolimus. The coated stent is vacuumed for 36 hours at approximately 1 torr. The stent is then crimped at 35° C. onto the balloon of a delivery catheter. The stent delivery system is packaged in a sterile barrier and sterilized by ebeam. The final stent material after treatment has a crystallinity of 25% (optionally between 10% and 50%). Before or during stent deployment, the stent is heated to a temperature greater than 37° C. and below 50° C. (optionally above 37° C. and below 45° C.) to expand it to its intended deployment diameter by means such as a heated balloon, RF balloon, heated contract agent injected into the artery, heated coil on the catheter shaft proximal to the balloon, or by other means. The expanded stent has sufficient strength to support a body lumen and/or recoil from an expanded state of less than 10%. Example 8 Methods of Fabricating a Stent or a Tube with Radiopaque Material One method to fabricate a stent with radiopacity is to have cup or hole features in the stent design. These cup or hole features are for holding radiopaque markers that can be higher in thickness, same thickness, or lower thickness as the stent. One or more cup or hole features can be on the stent. For example, 2 cups can be located at each end of the stent and can be 90 degrees apart. Markers can be made from metals such as gold, tungsten, tantalum, platinum, iridium, alloys of these metals, combination thereof, or other. Markers can also be made from stent material filled with radiopaque agents such as nanoparticles/microparticles/fibers/others made from metal like gold, tungsten, tantalum, platinum, iridium, alloys of these metals, combination thereof, or others; barium compounds like barium sulfate; or contrast media. The loading of these agents can be from 1 to 80% by weight. Another method to fabricate a stent with radiopacity is to add radiopaque agent fillers during the spraying, dipping, molding, 3D printing, extrusion, or the like. The radiopaque fillers can be nanoparticles/microparticles/fibers/others made from metal like gold, tungsten, tantalum, platinum, iridium, alloys of these metals, combination thereof, or others; barium compounds like barium sulfate at 1 to 80% by weight filling; or contrast media such as iodinated contrast agents like diatrizoate, metrizoate, ioxaglate, iopamidol, iohexol, ixolian, iopromide iodixanol; Ipodate sodium; sodium iopodate; gadolinium; potassium iodide; or other. The loading of these contrast agents can be from 10 to 80% by weight. Yet another method is to add molecules that contain iodine, barium, platinum, or heavy metal to the material used to fabricate the stent. These molecules can covalently attached to the material by grafting onto the polymer chains or crosslinking more than one polymer chains. These molecules contain one or more iodine, barium, platinum, or heavy metals. The percent of these molecules can vary from 1 to 50% by weight. Yet another method for making the stent radiopaque is to crimp the stent onto the balloon of an infusion catheter. As the stent is being expanded, contrast agents are infused into the artery at high pressure, making the artery radiopaque at the site of deployment. Depending on the hydrophobicity and lipophilicity of the contrast agents, these agents will wash out and the artery will no longer be radiopaque. Yet another method for making the stent radiopaque is to have a thin radiopaque metal or alloy structure within the stent. This thin radiopaque structure can be made from made from metal like gold, tungsten, tantalum, platinum, iridium, alloys of these metals, combination thereof, or others. The thickness of the structures can range from 0.0001″ to 0.001″. They can have circular, square, trapezoidal, rectangular, triangular, or other cross-sections. The structures can be small corrugated rings, part of or a whole stent, crowns, filaments. A tube of some thickness is first formed by partially dipping or spraying coating solutions of the stent material onto a mandrel. After coating, the thin radiopaque structures are placed in contact, pressed into place, or crimped into place on the partially dipped or spray tube. The tube with the radiopaque structure is then further dipped or sprayed until the final desired thickness has been reached. The tube is then patterned into a stent such that the radiopaque structures are partially or fully embedded in the stent. Yet another method for making the stent radiopaque is to have a thin radiopaque metal or alloy structure within the stent. This thin radiopaque structure can be made from metal like gold, tungsten, tantalum, platinum, iridium, molybdenum, iron, magnesium, alloys of these metals, combination thereof, or others. The thickness of the structures can range from 0.0005″ to 0.001″. They can have circular, square, trapezoidal, rectangular, triangular, or other cross-sections. This structure is then coated with a coating of bioresorbable material such as polylactide, poly(lactide-co-caprolactone), poly(lactide-co-glycolide), or the like. Example of a stent capable to expand to at least 120% or 1.2 times an intended deployment diameter while keeping an intact stent structure integrity and optionally having a recoil of less than 15% from an expanded state (optionally less than 10%, or less than 5%) is shown below. A stent is patterned from a tube made from Poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon caprolactone) material, preferably having a lactide to epsilon caprolactone comonomer ratio of 82:10 to 98:02, more preferably at 88:12 to 92:08. The tube can be formed using extrusion, molding, dipping, or spraying and treated. The glass transitional temperature, Tg, of the polymeric material after treatment is greater than 35° C. and less than approximately 55° C. The tube is patterned into a stent. Before crimping the stent or the tube has an inner diameter that can range from 0.9 to 1.5 times its intended deployment diameter. As an example, for a 3 mm intended deployment diameter stent, the inner diameter of the tube or the patterned stent is between 2.7 millimeter (0.106″) to 4.5 millimeter (0.177″). For a 3.5 mm stent, the inner diameter is between 3.15 millimeter (0.124″) to 5.25 millimeter (0.207″). The crimped stent is mounted onto a delivery system, packaged, and sterilized. The stent is expandable at body temperature to at least 120% of an intended deployment diameter (nominal diameter) with sufficient strength to support a body lumen and without breakage (fracture) in any of the stent struts (optionally while maintaining structural integrity of the stent) and optionally with a % recoil of less than 15% from an expanded state. Example 9 Method to Treat Above Tg at an Expanded Diameter A tube is formed by spraying or extrusion at diameter x where x is 0.8-1.5 times (80 to 150%) an intended deployment diameter, treatment of the tubular body to temperature above Tg, patterning at x diameter, crimping, and sterilizing. A stent is patterned from a tube made from Poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon caprolactone) material, preferably having a lactide to epsilon caprolactone comonomer ratio of 82:18 to 98:02, more preferably at 88:12 to 92:08. The tube can be formed by extrusion, molding, dipping, or spraying. Before it is patterned into a stent, the tube has an inner diameter that is 80 to 150% of the intended stent deployment diameter. As a further example, for a 3 mm intended deployment diameter for the stent, the tube inner diameter can range from 2.4 millimeter (0.094″) to 4.5 millimeter (0.177″). Another example is an intended deployment diameter of at least 3.5 mm stent. The tube inner diameter can range from 2.8 millimeter (0.110″) to 5.25 millimeter (0.207″). The tube is then heat treated above the Tg of material to increase the crystallinity of the stent by at least 5%. The temperature can range from 60° C. to 100° C. for 1 minutes to 24 hours. For example, the tube can be heated treated at 90° C. for 2 hours. The tube is patterned into a stent, coated with a drug matrix such as Poly(L-lactide) based copolymer and Novolimus, and crimped at 45° C. onto the balloon of a delivery catheter. The stent delivery system is the packaged in a sterile barrier and sterilized by ebeam. The stent is radially expandable at body temperature having sufficient radial strength to support a body lumen. Example 10 Tube or Stent with Amorphous Crystallinity after Modification A polymeric material is sprayed to form tube at x (x is 0.8-1.5 times intended deployment diameter), treated at about 75° C. for 15 minutes, patterned, crimped, sterilized, post stabilized (optional), wherein the polymeric material after treatment is amorphous. A stent is patterned from a tube made from Poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon caprolactone) material, preferably having a lactide to epsilon caprolactone comonomer ratio of 88:12 to 92:08. The tube can be formed by spraying. Before it is patterned into a stent, the tube has an inner diameter that is 80 to 150% of the intended stent deployment diameter. As a further example, for at least a 3 mm intended deployment diameter for the stent, the tube inner diameter can range from 2.7 millimeter (0.106″) to 4.5 millimeter (0.177″). Another example is a 3.5 mm stent. The tube inner diameter can range from 3.15 millimeter (0.124″) to 5.25 millimeter (0.207″). The tube is patterned into a stent, coated with a drug matrix such as Poly(L-lactide) based copolymer and Novolimus. The coated stent is vacuumed for 36 hours at approximately 1 torr. The stent is optionally heat treated at 70° C. for 15 minutes. The stent is then crimped at 30° C. onto the balloon of a delivery catheter over 30 minutes (optionally 1 minute to 1 hour). The stent delivery system is packaged in a sterile barrier and sterilized by ebeam. After sterilization, the stent delivery system is optionally stabilized at 29° C. for 48 hours. The final stent material is substantially amorphous with a percent crystallinity of less than approximately 25%. In one example, the intended deployment diameter is 3.0 mm. In another example it is 3.25 mm. In a third example it is 3.5 mm, and in a forth example it is 4.0 mm. Example 11 Crystallinity of Tube or Stent Between 10%-50% after Modification The tube is made by extrusion, a higher temperature than 75° C. is used for longer duration, wherein the crystallinity of polymeric material after treatment is between 10% and 50%. A stent is patterned from a tube made from Poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon caprolactone) material, preferably having a lactide to epsilon caprolactone comonomer ratio of 85:15 to 95:05. The tube can be formed by extrusion. Before crimping, the tube or the stent has an inner diameter that is 90 to 150% of the intended stent deployment diameter. As a further example, for an intended deployment diameter of at least 3 mm stent, the tube inner diameter can range from 2.7 millimeter (0.106″) to 4.5 millimeter (0.177″). Another example is a 3.5 mm stent. The tube inner diameter can range from 3.15 millimeter (0.124″) to 5.25 millimeter (0.207″). The tube is heat treated at 180° C. for 2 hours and quenched to at or below ambient temperature. The tube is patterned into a stent, coated with a drug matrix such as Poly(L-lactide) based copolymer and Novolimus. The coated stent is optionally vacuumed for 36 hours at approximately 1 torr. The stent is then crimped at 40° C. onto the balloon of a delivery catheter. The stent delivery system is packaged in a sterile barrier and sterilized by ebeam. After sterilization, the stent delivery system is optionally stabilized at 25° C. for 5 hours. The final stent material has crystallinity less than 50% (optionally between 0 and 50%). The stent is radially expandable at body temperature. Example of a stent capable to expand to at least 130% or 1.3 times an intended deployment diameter while keeping an intact stent structure integrity and optionally having a recoil of less than 15% from an expanded state (optionally less than 10%, or less than 5%) is shown herein. Example 12 Crystallinity of Stent Lower than Crystallinity of the Formed Tubular Body The tube is made by extrusion, wherein the crystallinity of polymeric material after forming is between 30% and 55%. The stent is treated and is patterned from a tube made from Poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon caprolactone) material, preferably having a lactide to epsilon caprolactone comonomer ratio of 85:15 to 95:05. The tube can be formed by extrusion. Before crimping, the tube or the stent has an inner diameter that is greater than the intended deployment diameter to 150% of the intended stent deployment diameter. As a further example, for an intended deployment diameter of at least 3 mm stent, the tube inner diameter can range from greater than 3.0 millimeter to 4.5 millimeter. Another example is a 3.5 mm stent. The tube inner diameter can range from greater than 3.5 millimeter to 5.25 millimeter. The tube is heat treated at 90° C. for 2 hours and quenched to below ambient temperature. The tube is patterned into a stent, coated with a drug matrix such as Poly(L-lactide) based copolymer and Novolimus. The coated stent is optionally vacuumed for 36 hours at approximately 1 torr. The stent is then crimped at 45° C. onto the balloon of a delivery catheter. The stent delivery system is packaged in a sterile barrier and sterilized by ebeam. After sterilization, the stent delivery system is optionally stabilized at 25° C. for 5 hours. The stent material has crystallinity less than 30%. The stent is radially expandable at body temperature and has sufficient strength. Example 13 Stent or Tube with the Ability Expand Above 1.3 Times Intended Deployment Diameter, while Maintaining Structural Integrity or No Breakage (Fracture) in the Struts, Links, or Crowns A tubular stent is made as described above and at the end state the stent is expanded under physiologic conditions (or 37° C. in water) unconstrained or constrained inside a tube and expanded to 1.3 times the labeled or intended deployment diameter without breakage/fracture in any of the stent struts, links, or crowns. A stent is patterned from a tube made from Poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon caprolactone) material, preferably having a lactide to epsilon caprolactone comonomer ratio of 82:18 to 98:02, more preferably at 88:12 to 92:08. The tube can be formed by extrusion, molding, dipping, or spraying. The glass transitional temperature, Tg, of the polymeric material is greater than approximately 35° C. and less than approximately 55° C. Before it is patterned into a stent or before it is crimped, the tube has an inner diameter of 0.9 to 1.5 times an intended deployment diameter. As an example, for an intended deployment diameter of at least 3 mm stent, the expanded inner diameter is between 2.7 millimeter (0.106″) to 4.5 millimeter (0.177″). For a 3.5 mm stent, the expanded inner diameter is between 3.15 millimeter (0.124″) to 5.25 millimeter (0.207″). The tube is treated below the Tg of the material, ranging from 40° C. to 55° C., or heated at a temperature between the glass transitional temperature and its ambient temperature. A mandrel about the size of the inner diameter of the tube or the stent or smaller is optionally placed inside the tube and the tube is optionally heated above the Tg of the material or optionally treated below Tg of the material for duration ranging from a fraction of a second to 5 hours. The tubing can either be slowly cooled or quickly quenched quickly to a temperature below the crystallization temperature or the glass transitional temperature. For example, an extruded tubing is made from 90:10 Poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon-caprolactone) material. The tube is expanded from an inside diameter of 1 millimeter (0.041″) to 3.1 millimeter (0.122″) at a temperature of 100° C. A 3 millimeter mandrel is placed inside the expanded tube. The tube on a mandrel is placed in an oven at 70° C. for a duration of about 1 hour. After heating, the tube is allowed to cool slowly to ambient temperature. The tube is patterned into a stent. The stent is coated with a drug matrix consisting of Poly(L-lactide) based copolymer and a macrocyclic lactone drug such as Novolimus. The coated stent is placed in a vacuum for a total of 36 hours. It is then heated to a 70° C. which is above the Tg of the Poly(L-lactide) based copolymer coating for approximately 15 to 30 minutes. The coated and treated stent is then crimped onto a balloon catheter at a temperature below the glass transitional temperature of the stent material, preferably between 10° C. to 40° C. below the Tg of the stent material. After crimping, the stent delivery system is packaged in a sterile barrier (i.e., in a foil pouch) and sterilized by ebeam or cold ethylene oxide cycle. The stent delivery system is then placed in an oven or incubator at 25° C. to 30° C. for 24 to 168 hours, preferably at 29° C. for 48 hours. The stent can then be deployed to or above 130 percent of an intended deployment diameter without fracture/breakage of stent struts, links, or crowns under physiologic conditions or in a simulated conditions unconstrained or constrained within a tube. The stent is expandable at body temperature and optionally have recoil of less than 15% from an expanded condition. In this example, 15% recoil is the mean recoil measurement. Example 14 Physical Properties of a Bioresorbable Polymeric Stent The physical properties of a biodegradable material of claimed invention stent was compared to a bare metal stent in the following manner: A. Example of Radial Strength (Radial Compression) Measurement The test specimen is placed into a fixture which applies radial compression. The fixture has compression dies or blades that are oriented in an iris-like configuration. These blades are actuated by a tensile force measurement machine through a mechanical linkage connected to a force gauge, which varies the opening of the fixture. The force versus displacement is constantly measured. The force is normalized to a force per unit measurement so that test specimens of various designs and dimensions may be conveniently compared. Other means to measure radial compression can be applied as well. Radial strength examples can be the mean value measurement of radial strength for multiple samples or a single measurement of radial strength for a single sample. B. Recoil This is one example of measuring recoil. Other measurement techniques can apply as well. The test specimen is expanded per the instructions for use and the diameter is measured at one or more locations while the device is inflated (Diameter-Initial) using an appropriate instrument. The test specimen is then measured at similar locations at one or more time intervals after device deflation (Diameter-Final), and the recoil is calculated as the percent change in diameter, or (Diameter-Initial−Diameter-Final)/Diameter-Initial*100%. As one skilled in the art, recoil can be measured using various method for bench testing of recoil, QCA measurement for recoil, OCT measurements for recoil. An example of recoil is a single measurement at a single location, or mean measurement at a single or multiple locations for the same stent. C. Crimped Flexibility and Expanded Conformability In this example, the test specimen is placed into a fixture which applies a 3 point bend load. The test specimen may be as-manufactured or prepared in a clinically-relevant manner, such as soaking the device in fluid at body temperature prior to testing, or expanding the device per the instructions for use. The 3 point bend fixture has a span that is a fixed distance appropriate for the sample, such as 13 mm of a sample that is greater than 13 mm. An anvil is aligned to the center of the span and connected to the force gauge on a tensile force measurement machine, which lowers the anvil and in turn applies a force to the test specimen, which is centered across the span. The force versus displacement is constantly measured to a fixed displacement, such as 15% of the span. The force per unit displacement is calculated. The results are shown in FIGS. 13 and 14. BDES stands for bioresorbable, drug eluting stent, while BMS stands for bare metal stent. D. In Vitro Testing FIG. 15 shows an example of in vitro testing of an expanded sample stent to approximately 3.0 mm internal diameter (ID) with an outer diameter (OD) of about 3.3 mm (prior to approximately less than 10% recoil from an expanded state). The stent diameter is at least maintained or grows over time (approximately within 15 days) to approximately at least 3.0 mm and substantially maintain the stent over a period of time such as over 1 month, 2 month, 3 month, or 4 months. This experiment was conducted in a saline tube submerged in a water bath at 37° C. The diameters of the stents were measured at approximately the middle of the stent using an optical comparator. FIG. 16 shows an example of in vitro testing for MW over time for design A and design B submerged in a saline at 37° C. showing MW decreasing over time. MW was measured using GPC. Design A and Design B were stents with different patterning designs and treatments. FIG. 17 shows an example of in vitro testing of sample design A and design B submerged in a saline at 37° C. showing that the stent radial strength after expansion of the stent increases by at least 5%, or at least 10%, or at least by 15% over time (within approximately 30 days or within approximately 15 days) and maintains sufficient strength to support a body lumen for at least one month, or at least two months, or at least three months, or at least four months. A stent deployed to nominal diameter increased in strength over initial period followed by a decrease in strength. Radial strength was measured using the radial compression iris method. FIG. 18 shows a stent balloon expanded to around 3.6 mm OD wherein the stent further self expands within one hour by at least 0.1 mm. Example 15 Biodegradable Stent A stent is patterned from a tube made from Poly(L-lactide-co-epsilon caprolactone) material blended with 0.1%-10% by weight ratio polyglycolide polymer or glycolide monomer, preferably having a lactide to epsilon caprolactone comonomer ratio of 82:18 to 98:02 blended with 0.1%-10% polyglycolide or glycolide by weight ratio, more preferably at 88:12 to 92:08 and 5% or under by weight ratio polyglycolide polymer or glycolide monomer. The tube can be formed by extrusion, molding, dipping, printing, or spraying. The glass transitional temperature, Tg, of the polymeric material optionally is greater than approximately 35° C. and less than approximately 55° C. Before it is patterned into a stent or before it is crimped, the tube has optionally an inner diameter of 0.9 to 1.5 times an intended deployment diameter. As an example, for an intended deployment diameter of at least 3 mm stent, the expanded inner diameter is between 2.7 millimeter (0.106″) to 4.5 millimeter (0.177″). For a 3.5 mm stent, the expanded inner diameter is between 3.15 millimeter (0.124″) to 5.25 millimeter (0.207″). The tube is treated below the Tg of the material, ranging from 40° C. to 55° C., or heated at a temperature between the glass transitional temperature and its ambient temperature, or treated by heat above Tg. A mandrel about the size of the inner diameter of the tube or the stent or smaller is optionally placed inside the tube and the tube is optionally heated above the Tg of the material or optionally treated below Tg of the material for duration ranging from a fraction of a second to 5 hours. The tubing can either be slowly cooled or quickly quenched quickly to a temperature below the crystallization temperature or the glass transitional temperature. The stent prosthesis is crimped onto a delivery system. The stent is capable of radial expansion under physiologic environment and/or 37 C to a deployed diameter from a crimped diameter. The stent has sufficient strength to support a body lumen at an expanded diameter, the stent optionally has % acute recoil of under 10%, the stent substantially degrades under 2 years, preferably substantially degrades under 1.5 years. A tubular stent is made as described above and at the end state the stent is expanded under physiologic conditions (or 37° C. in water) unconstrained or constrained inside a tube and expanded to >1.1 times the labeled or intended deployment diameter without breakage/fracture in any of the stent struts, links, or crowns. A. In Vitro Testing, Diameter, Strength, and Degradation Study A stent prosthesis was fabricated in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. Samples of three designs were produced and expanded to a deployed diameter using indeflator. An initial diameter measurement was taken and strength was measured at time zero. The units were tested in environment simulating physiologic environment (and/or 37 C in water) such as placed into a single capped 250 mL bottle filled with saline (0.85% Sodium Chloride solution, Sigma Aldrich) and maintained at 37° C. in a static water bath for the duration of the test. At regular intervals the diameter, strength, and molecular weight were measured. FIGS. 19A and 19B show balloon expanded stents at least maintain the diameter of tubular stents of design A, design B, and design C, over time (1 month and 6 months, respectively). FIG. 20 shows changes in the strength of tubular stents of design A, design B, and design C over time. B. Scaffold Implantation in Porcine Model The scaffold was implanted in the internal mammary artery in a porcine model per standard implantation techniques. The scaffold and the artery were explanted at different timepoints and the scaffold material molecular weight was measured using analytical techniques. The scaffold molecular weight decreases by 50% in less than six months. The molecular weight decreases to less than 25% in less than 6 months. The molecular weight decreases to less than 10% in less than 18 months. The in vitro and in vivo molecular weight over time was plotted on a graph and demonstrated that the in vitro and in vivo degradation was similar. FIGS. 21A and 21B show the decrease of molecular weight of stent over one to two years with radial strength sufficient to support a blood vessel for at least 2 months. C. Underdeployed Stent Scaffold Apposition Testing A sample unit of the present invention was underdeployed in a mock artery, which was a plastic block with a 3.2 mm hole. The scaffold diameter was recorded as 3.12 mm Backlighting was employed to visually identify gaps between the scaffold outer diameter and the block inner diameter. The block with the scaffold in the hole was then placed in a 37° C. water bath and the presence of gaps was noted. After 5-10 minutes, the gaps were no longer present. The scaffold was removed and measured to be equal or greater than 3.2 mm, confirming that the malapposition between scaffold and mock artery fixture had been resolved. FIG. 22A illustrates a stent scaffold deployed in a block, with a final diameter smaller than block simulating malapposed struts. FIG. 22B illustrates stent scaffold within 5-10 minutes of soaking in water at 37° C., with gaps “resolved” and no longer present. The example shows a balloon expanded stents, where in the stent further self expands to a larger diameter or transverse dimension, or until the stent apposes the vessel wall. D. Scaffold Strut Malapposition Testing A sample unit of the present invention was deployed in a mock artery, which was a plastic block with a 3.2 mm hole, with a 0.3 mm mandrel on one side creating an eccentric deployment cross-section. The mandrel was removed and created a malapposition between the scaffold and the surface of the mock artery. Backlighting was employed to visually identify the gap between the scaffold and the block inner diameter. The block with the scaffold in the hole was then placed in a 37° C. water bath and the presence or absence of the malapposition was noted over time. After 20 minutes, the gap was no longer visually present. FIG. 23A illustrates a stent scaffold expanded in a mock artery with a 0.3 mm mandrel on the side. FIG. 23B illustrates a stent scaffold with mandrel removed, confirming that a gap is still present. FIG. 23C illustrates a stent scaffold shows a stent scaffold after 10 minutes of soaking in water, and FIG. 23D illustrates a stent scaffold after 20 minutes of soaking in water where in the stent is apposed against the vessel wall. This also provides an example of stent strut self expanding to appose against the vessel wall during a side branch treatment procedure of kissing balloon technique where in the guidewire has to be pulled out from under the expanded stent in the vessel leaving behind unapposed struts. The Stent struts in the present invention after the procedure will self expand by at least 0.1 mm and appose to the vessel wall. E. Scaffold Overexpansion Study Sample units of the present invention were deployed in a 37° C. water bath to nominal diameter of 3.0 mm using standard inflation techniques. The scaffolds were then post-dilated to multiple diameters and inspected at regular intervals until a fracture was noted. The diameter at fracture was recorded. Pictures were also taken at regular intervals. By testing several units, the number of units with fractures at a given diameter was calculated and plotted. FIG. 24 shows a plot illustrating the likelihood of fracture against post-dilated scaffold diameter for (e.g., a balloon expanded stent at nominal diameter of 3.0 mm and further balloon expanded to 4.8 mm diameter, 1.6 times the nominal deployed diameter, survives without fracture). FIG. 25A depicts a scaffold at 3.0 mm nominal diameter, and FIG. 25B depicts a scaffold deployed at nominal and further balloon expanded at 3.8 mm overexpanded diameter. FIG. 25C depicts a scaffold deployed at nominal and further balloon expanded to 4.0 mm overexpanded diameter, FIG. 25D depicts a scaffold deployed at nominal and further balloon expanded to 4.4 mm overexpanded diameter, FIG. 25E depicts a scaffold deployed at nominal and further balloon expanded to a 4.75 mm overexpanded diameter, and FIG. 25F depicts a scaffold deployed at nominal and further balloon expanded to a 5.1 mm overexpanded diameter. The figures shows the undulating rings of the stent overexpanded to substantially circular rings without fracture. Example 16 Bioresorbable Polymeric Stent+Myolimus @ 3 μg Per mm Stent Length (DESolve First in Man Study) The DESolve I trial is a first in man study enrolling 15 patients evaluating the Myolimus Eluting Bioresorbable Coronary Scaffold System (CSS) with a PLLA based polymer. The principal imaging endpoints include: in-stent late lumen loss assessed by QCA at 6 months, stent and vessel assessment using IVUS, OCT at baseline and 6 months, and multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) at 12 and 24 months to provide long-term assessment of the vessel. The principal safety endpoint is the composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) comprised of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction (MI) and clinically-indicated target vessel revascularization (TLR) at 30 days, 6, 12 months, and 2-5 years. The stent size used is 3.0×14 mm and myolimus drug dose is 3 μg per mm of stent length. A portion of the available results as measured and analyzed by the principal investigators lab are shown in the Table 14 below A complete analysis of the results from the core laboratory are presented later in Part II.

Circ 2007; 115; 2344-2351 Example 18 Stent Fabrication A tube is made by spraying an amorphous copolymer poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) with 85% lactide and 15% glycolide. The polymer and rapamycin analog can be dissolved in a solvent and can be sprayed together to incorporate the rapamycin into the polymer stent. A mandrel is placed underneath an ultrasonic spray nozzle (Micromist System with Ultrasonic Atomizing Nozzle Sprayer, Sono-Tek, NY) which is rotating at 80 rpm and move longitudinally at a rate of 0.050 inches/minutes. A solution of 11 to 1 ratio of poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) and rapamycin analog on the mandrel. The resulting tube has a thickness of 0.17 mm. The tube is heated at 45° C. for about 60 hours, annealed at 90° C. for 2 hours, and cooled to ambient or room temperature within 10 seconds. The annealed tube is then cut with a UV laser to the design shown in FIG. 34 (shown in its crimped state). The cut stent is annealed at 90° C. and slowly cooled from the annealing temperature to ambient temperature within eight hours. The stent delivery system is then packaged in a pouch and sterilized by gamma radiation. The heat treated stent has higher radial strength than the non-treated stent (Table 19).

The tubular body is annealed to increased crystallinity and strength, usually by the heating and cooling processes described above. The tubular body is then patterned to form a stent or other endoprosthesis, typically by laser cutting, usually after at least one annealing treatment. Optionally, the tubular body may be treated both before and after patterning, and may be treated by annealing more than once both before and after the patterning. Referring now to FIGS. 32A and 32B, a stent 10 suitable for modification by the present invention has base pattern including a plurality of adjacent serpentine rings 12 joined by axial links 14. As illustrated, the stent 10 includes six adjacent serpentine rings 12, where each ring includes six serpentine segments comprising a pair of axial struts 16 joined by a hinge-like crown 18 at one end. The number of rings and segments may vary widely depending on the size of the desired size of the stent. According to the present invention, a supporting feature 20 is disposed between adjacent axial struts 16 and connected so that it will expand, usually elongate, circumferentially with the struts, as shown in FIG. 3. The supporting features 20 are in a generally closed U-shaped configuration prior to expansion, as shown in FIGS. 32A and 32B, and open into a shallow V-shape along with the opening of the axial struts 16 about the crowns 18 during radial expansion of the serpentine rings 12, as shown in FIG. 33. Supporting features 20 enhance the hoop strength of the stent after radial expansion, help resist recoil after expansion is completed, and provide additional area for supporting the vascular or other luminal wall and optionally for delivering drugs into the luminal wall. Example 33 Novolimus Eluting Bioresorbable Stent in a Clinical Trial DESolve Nx was a prospective, multicenter international trial evaluating the DESolve Nx Novolimus Eluting Coronary Scaffold System of the present invention. The trial was conducted at 13 international centers across Europe, Brazil and New Zealand with enrollment of 126 patients. The trial was designed to evaluate single de novo coronary artery lesions with a reference vessel diameter between 2.75 and 3.0 mm and lesion length <12 mm Scaffold sizes available were 3.0, 3.25, 3.5 mm diameters and 14 and 18 mm lengths. Study follow up for clinical events was scheduled for 30 days, six months, 12 months and yearly until five years. Imaging endpoint assessments were planned for six month follow up (QCA for all patients and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) OCT in a subset of patients) and 12 month follow up (Multislice computed tomography (MSCT) in a subset of patients).

Example 19 Tapered Main Artery and Bifurcation An artery may be tapered such that the proximal segment is larger in diameter than the distal segment. This typically occurs at a bifurcation of a main artery and a side branch. The current embodiment of the device may be expanded such that the sizing is appropriate for the distal segment of the main artery, and somewhat smaller in diameter than the proximal segment of the main artery. In a normal balloon expandable scaffold or stent expanded in such a manner, the proximal segment would then be malapposed to the vessel wall. The malapposition may be resolved by expanding the proximal segment of the scaffold with a post-dilatation balloon to a larger diameter positioned appropriately at the proximal segment. The current embodiment of the device has the ability to be expanded to a large diameter at the proximal segment such that the scaffold does not fracture. Because the current embodiment of the device has the ability to self-expand over time, the malapposition would be resolved and the scaffold would self-appose to the artery wall. For example, a scaffold is manufactured from a 4.0 mm tube. The scaffold is deployed in an artery that is tapered from 3.5 mm to 2.75 mm (proximal to distal). The device is crimped onto a delivery system, delivered to the tapered deployment site, and expanded to 3.0 mm. The 2.75 mm distal segment is well apposed, and the proximal 3.5 mm segment is malapposed. The malapposition is resolved by either post-dilating the proximal segment with a larger 3.5 mm balloon without fracturing the scaffold, or allowed to resolve over a period of time by the ability of the device to self-resolve malapposition. Example 20 Balloon Expansion Followed by Self Expansion A biodegradable stent is fabricated from a polymeric sheet comprising lactide-co-caprolactone (or a blend of lactide and caprolactone) wherein the sheet is joined at its ends via solvent bonding, ultrasonic bonded, inductive heating bonded, or heat welding. The polymeric sheet has an initial diameter of 4.5 mm. The stent is treated, and crimped without fracture onto a balloon catheter and sterilized at 30 kGy. After sterilization, the stent at body temperature is balloon expanded from a crimped configuration to a first expanded diameter of 3.5 mm and wherein the stent further self expands to a second larger diameter of 3.75 within 24 hours. The stent does not have fractures (completely broken struts) at the first or second expanded diameters and has sufficient strength to support a body lumen. The stent is patterned before the sheet is joined or after. Example 21 Self Expansion Followed by Balloon Expansion A biodegradable stent comprising a polymeric material comprising lactide-co-glycolide (or a blend of lactide and glycolide) which is molded into an initial diameter that is 0.9-1.5 times the nominal/labeled deployed stent diameter. The initial diameter is 4.5 mm and the nominal deployment/labeled diameter is 3.5 mm. The stent is crimped to a smaller diameter of about 1.5 mm onto a catheter without fracture and sterilized at 30 kGy. The stent at body temperature (about 37 C) self expands from the crimped configuration to a first expanded diameter of about 3.75 mm within about 30 minutes and further expanded by balloon to a second expanded diameter of 4.75 mm without fracture and have sufficient strength to support a body lumen. The stent is patterned by the mold or after the mold or the mold forms a tubular body that is subsequently patterned. Example 22 Incorporation of at Least One Solvent to Allow Expansion of a Stent without Fracture A biodegradable stent comprising a polymeric material formed into a tubular body wherein the polymeric material comprises lactide-co-caprolactone (or a blend of lactide and caprolactone). The tubular body is formed by spraying the polymeric material onto a mandrel. DCM is incorporated into the solution to such that the amount of DCM after treatment is 1.5% by weight of the polymeric material. The tubular body is treated, is patterned, and is crimped onto a delivery system without fracture and sterilized. The stent at body temperature (about 37 C) is expandable from the crimped configuration to an expanded diameter that is 1.2 times the nominal deployment diameter (labeled diameter) of the stent without fracture and having sufficient strength to support a body lumen. Example 23 Incorporation of Monomer in Amounts Sufficient to Allow Expansion of the Stent without Fracture A biodegradable stent is formed by 3-D printing of polymeric material comprising polylactide-co-glycolide blended with about 30000 ppm of ε-caprolactone monomer. The stent is treated and crimped to a smaller diameter of about 1 mm without fracture, and sterilized. The stent at body temperature is expanded from the crimped configuration to the expanded diameter of nominal or higher without fracture and having sufficient strength to support a blood vessel. Example 24 Crimping without Fracture A biodegradable stents having the pattern of FIG. 1 were laser cut from polymeric tubes made by spraying polymeric material comprising poly(L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) copolymers or blends and treated, and patterned into stents. Five stents having an initial inner diameter of 2.5 mm are subjected to crimping at 45° C. After crimping, the inner diameters of the stents are 2.0 mm, 1.8 mm, 1.4 mm, 1.6 mm, and 1.2 mm, 1.0, 0.8 mm respectively. None of the five stents exhibit significant cracks or any fractures. Example 25 Pressure Treatment to Control Crystallinity A biodegradable stent comprising a polymeric material is formed by spraying a solution of 85% L-lactide to 15% glycolide onto a mandrel. The material has crystallinity of 40% The material is then placed in a high pressure stainless steel vessel, sealed, and subjected to carbon dioxide at a pressure of 700 psi for 24 hours. After the exposure to carbon dioxide, the crystallinity is about 25% by XRD. Example 26 Expansion of a Biodegradable Stent Above Nominal Deployment without Fracture A biodegradable stent comprising poly(L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) polymer is molded into a tubular body, is treated, and is patterned. The stent has an initial diameter of 3.8 mm. The stent is crimped to a 1 mm diameter without fracture and mounted on a 3.0 mm nominal/labeled balloon of a catheter and sterilized at 30 kGy. The stent at body temperature is balloon expanded to above the nominal/labeled deployment diameter of 3.0 mm by expanding it to 4.8 mm without fracture and have sufficient strength to support a blood vessel. Example 27 Drug Incorporation into the Polymeric Material or Tubular Body for Extended Delivery 180 mg Poly-DL-lactide is dissolved in 60 ml of dichloromethane and 1 mg of rapamycin is added to the solution. The mixture is mixed for 10 minutes. The mixture is then sprayed onto a mandrel to form a tubular body. After dichloromethane evaporates, the mandrel is removed from the tube and tube is allowed to air-dried for 48 hours. The tubular body is patterned into a stent. The stent is crimped without fracture and mounted on a balloon of a catheter and sterilized at 30 kGy. The stent body temperature is expanded from a crimped configuration to deliver the drug over an extended period of time between 3 months and 2 years. Example 28 Treatment to Control of One or More of Crystallinity, Tg, and MW A biodegradable stent as in any of the examples from A though H wherein the polymeric material is treated to control at least one of crystallinity, Tg, or MW, wherein the crystallinity ranges from 1% to 50%, Tg ranges from >37 C to 50 C, and MW ranges from 30 Kda to 700 Kda wherein the stent is capable to be crimped and expanded from a crimped condition to a deployed condition without fracture and have sufficient strength to support a body lumen. Example 29 Biodegradable Stent Properties A biodegradable stent as in Examples 20 through 28 comprising a polymeric material wherein the material has at least one of elastic modulus of 0.35 GPa or higher, strength of 2 psi or higher, recoil from an expanded diameter of 10% or less; wherein the stent is capable to be crimped from an expanded condition to a crimped condition without fracture and wherein the stent is capable at body temperature to be expanded to nominal diameter or higher without fracture.

Example 30 Fabricating a Stent and Treatment of Stent by Heat at a Temperature Above Tg Before Patterning, and then Crimping the Stent onto a Delivery System at a Temperature Below Tg A biodegradable stent comprising a polymeric material formed optionally into a tubular body wherein the polymeric material comprises lactide-co-caprolactone (or a blend of lactide and caprolactone). The tubular body is formed optionally by spraying the polymeric material onto a mandrel. DCM (or other suitable solvent capable of dissolving completely the polymeric material) is incorporated into the solution to such that the amount of DCM after treatment is less than 1.5% by weight of the polymeric material. The tubular body is treated by heating at a temperature above Tg of the polymeric material for a time period ranging from 10 seconds to 5 hours, and/or cooling at a temperature below Tg of the polymeric material, is patterned at substantially the same diameter as the formed diameter, and is crimped onto a delivery system at a temperature below Tg of the polymeric material. The stent at body temperature (about 37 C) is expandable from the crimped configuration to an expanded diameter that is 1.2 times the nominal deployment diameter (labeled diameter) of the stent without fracture and having sufficient strength to support a body lumen. Example 31 Fabricating a Stent and Treatment of Stent at Substantially the Same Diameter of the Formed Polymeric Tube Outer Diameter, by Pressure, Heat at a Temperature Above Tg, and Optionally Stretching; Before Patterning; and then Crimping the Stent onto a Delivery System at a Temperature Below Tg A 4.00 mm outer diameter and 3.70 mm inner diameter polymeric tube comprising 85:15 poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) formed by extrusion, spraying, dipping, or the like. This tube is placed inside a metal (or glass mold) mold with approximately 4.0 mm diameter cylindrical hole (inner diameter of the mold), (or optionally 4.0 mm inner diameter mold, or optionally less than 4.0 mm ID mold, or optionally 4.1 mm ID mold, or optionally a mold ID with 0.9-1.15 times the formed OD of the polymeric material, or optionally a mold ID with 0.9-1.1, times the formed OD of the polymeric material. The mold optionally could be composed of two halve for ease of tube placement and removal. The mold and/or the polymeric material is heated to above the polymeric material Tg. The ID of the polymeric material is pressurized at pressure(s) ranging from 100 PSi to 5000 psi in a fraction of a second to 5 minutes, and the polymeric material is optionally stretched by an amount ranging from 10% to 500% of the polymeric material length in a time ranging from a fraction of a second to 5 minutes. The polymeric material is optionally cooled at a temperature below Tg in a time ranging from a fraction of a second to 50 minutes. The compressed polymeric tubing with approximately 4.00 mm outer diameter (+/−0.1 mm) and an Inner diameter ranging from 3.8 to approximately 3.6 mm inner diameter is then removed. The wall of the polymeric tube in this example is compressed approximately 0.0005″. The modified tube is patterned at substantially the same diameter, and subsequently coated with a drug/or drug-polymer and subsequently crimped onto a delivery system at a temperature below Tg of the polymeric material and then sterilized. The stent at body temperature (about 37 C) is expandable from the crimped configuration to an expanded diameter having sufficient strength to support a body lumen. Example 32 Novolimus Eluting Bioresorbable Coronary Stent System in the Porcine Model Studies were performed in a porcine model with the Novolimus Eluting Bioresorbable Coronary Stent System which combines a polymer stent coated with a thin topcoat layer of polymer with Novolimus. The stents in the studies comprised PLLA, PLLAPGA, PLLAPCL, Poly (L lactide-co-Glycolide) and poly(L lactide-co-caprolactone). At least one of the studies is described below. The nominal drug dose in the coating on the 18 mm length stent is 85 μg of Novolimus and coating is poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide). The purpose of the studies are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the polymeric degradable drug eluting stent after a period of 1 m, 3 m, 6 m, 9 m, 1 year and 2 years. The vascular response, including the arterial minimal lumen diameter and percent stenosis, will be evaluated in all vessels using quantitative vessel angiography (QCA) at 1 m, 3 m, 6 m, 9 m, 1 year and 2 years. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will also be performed at time points to assess stent apposition and recoil. Additionally, histopathologic analysis of the coronary arteries will be performed at 1 m, 3 m, 6 m and 2 years to evaluate the cellular response to the stents. Another purpose of this study is to evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of the released drug at 3 days, 7 days, 28±2 days, and longer timepoints; drug release will be assessed by analysis of the drug remaining on the stents and uptake of the drug by the tissue. A nonatherosclerotic swine model was chosen. Hybrid farm pigs (Landrance-Yorkshire) were selected for use in studies up to 3 m in length and Yucatan Mini Swine were selected for use in the 6 m and longer term studies due to starting size and growth expectations. When possible, stents are implanted in the 3 coronary arteries (left circumflex artery [LCx], left anterior descending artery [LAD] and right coronary artery [RCA]), and in the left and right internal mammary arteries (IMAs) per animal. Upon assignment to the study and until sacrifice, animals will be monitored and observed at least twice a day. To prevent or reduce the occurrence of thrombotic events, animals are treated daily, with acetylsalicylic acid (325 mg, per os [PO]) and clopidogrel (300 mg on the first day and 75 mg daily afterwards, PO), beginning at least 3 days before intervention and continuing until sacrifice. The drugs will be crushed to powder and mixed with their food; therefore, treatment will not be administered when animals are fasted. Fasting (food, including any dietary supplements) will be conducted the morning prior to interventional procedures and scheduled sacrifice. Water will not be withheld. Animals will be tranquilized with ketamine, azaperone and atropine administered intramuscularly [IM]. Animal weight will be recorded. Anesthesia induction will be achieved with propofol injected intravenously [IV]. Upon induction of light anesthesia, the subject animal will be intubated and supported with mechanical ventilation. Isoflurane in oxygen will be administered to maintain a surgical plane of anesthesia. Intravenous fluid therapy will be initiated and maintained throughout the procedure. The rate may be increased to replace blood loss or to correct low systemic blood pressure. To prevent postoperative infection, animals will be given prophylactic antibiotic Draxxin® IM. Additional doses may be administered as deemed appropriate. In order to prevent pain sensitization and minimize postoperative pain, Torbugesic (butorphanol) will be administered IM as preemptive analgesia. After induction of anesthesia, the left or right femoral artery will be accessed through an incision made in the inguinal region. Bupivacain IM will be infiltrated into the femoral access site to achieve local anesthesia and manage pain after surgery. An arterial sheath will be introduced and advanced into the artery. An initial heparin bolus will be administered and ACT will be measured at least every 30 minutes and recorded. The device will not be introduced until ACT is confirmed to be >300 seconds. If ACT is <300 seconds, additional heparin will be administered. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a guiding catheter will be inserted through the sheath (6F) and advanced to the appropriate location. After placement of the guiding catheter, nitroglycerin will be delivered to achieve vasodilatation and angiographic images of the vessel will be obtained with contrast media to identify the proper location for the deployment site (designated pre-stent angiographies). A segment of coronary artery will be chosen and a guidewire will be inserted into the chosen artery. QCA will be performed at this time to document the reference diameter for stent placement. OCT will be performed before implantation to confirm vessel sizing at three locations per coronary vessel. Stent Deployment Procedures: The stent will be introduced into the selected artery (diameter range of 2.6 to 3.0 mm if possible) by advancing the delivery system through the guiding catheter, over the guide wire to the deployment site. After the stent enters the guide catheter, there will be at least a one minute soak wait before deploying the stent. The stent will then be deployed. The balloon will be inflated at a slow rate: starting with 10 second intervals per atmosphere, bring the balloon to 2 atm. Further expansion completed at 3-5 second intervals for each subsequent atmosphere of pressure. This is approx. 40-50 seconds to nominal pressure. Final pressure is maintained for 20-30 seconds. An angiogram of the balloon at full inflation will be recorded (designated balloon angiography) and the inflation pressure will be noted. After the target stent to artery ratio has been achieved, vacuum will be slowly applied to the inflation device to deflate the balloon. Complete balloon deflation will be verified fluoroscopically. A second inflation may be conducted if a stent is not well apposed against arterial wall or if an animal is at risk. Injection of nitroglycerin will be repeated and a final angiogram of the treated vessel will be performed (designated post-stent angiography) to document device patency, and TIMI flow Implantation will be repeated in the other vessels. OCT will be performed on animals to assess stent recoil. OCT will be performed before implantation to confirm vessel sizing at three locations per coronary vessel. After all implants are completed, OCT will be performed again for the same (first) stent, followed by every other stent implanted in the coronaries (designated end of implant OCT). Following the successful deployment of stents and completion of angiography, all catheters and the sheath will be removed from the animal and the femoral artery will be ligated. The incision will be closed in layers with appropriate suture materials. An antibiotic ointment will be applied to the wound. The fluoroscopic output from the stent implantation (pre-stent, balloon inflation, post-stent, and end of implant) and at explantation (final) was recorded in digital format. From these images, QCA measurements were obtained. OCT imaging was performed in animal after the first stent was implanted and after all implants had been completed. Several semi-quantitative parameters were employed to assess the biological response of vascular tissue to the stents by light microscopy examination of stained sections. Other organ samples were observed for any abnormal findings. 1. An expandable biodegradable stent, comprising: a tubular biodegradable polymeric material, said expandable stent being expandable from a crimped configuration to a deployed configuration. 2.-30.
