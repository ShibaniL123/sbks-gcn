DETAILED DESCRIPTION Reference will now be made in detail to the embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. In the embodiments of the present invention, a manipulation device is applied to a ceiling type radiographic apparatus, in which a guide rail is mounted to the ceiling of an inspection room, although the manipulation device may be applied to various kinds of radiographic apparatuses. FIG. 1 is a view illustrating the main components of a radiographic apparatus 1 according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 1, the radiographic apparatus 1 includes a capturing device 2 and a controller 3 to control the capturing device 2. The capturing device 2 includes an X-ray irradiator 10 to radiate X-rays towards a subject, a high voltage generator 20 to supply high voltage to the X-ray irradiator 10 to cause it to generate X-rays, a capturing stand 91 and capturing table 92 having X-ray detectors 91a and 92a to receive X-rays transmitted through the subject, respectively, and a shifter to shift an X-ray irradiation position and direction of the X-ray irradiator 10. The shifter includes a guide rail arrangement 30 mounted to the ceiling of an inspection room, a moving carriage 40 movable along the guide rail 30, a post frame 50 connected between the moving carriage 40 and the X-ray irradiator 10, and a drive device 70 to provide drive force to shift the guide rail 30, the moving carriage 40 and the post frame 50. The guide rail 30 includes a first guide rail 31 and a second guide rail 32 forming a predetermined angle with the first guide rail 31. In the illustrated embodiment, the first guide rail 31 and the second guide rail 32 extend perpendicularly to each other. An upper side of the first guide rail 31 is mounted to the ceiling of the inspection room in which the radiographic apparatus 1 is located. The second guide rail 32 is slidably mounted to the first guide rail 31 at the lower side of the first guide rail 31. At the first guide rail 31 may be disposed a roller mechanism (not shown) movable along the first guide rail 31. The second guide rail 32 may be connected to the roller mechanism (not shown) so that the second guide rail 32 is movable along the first guide rail 31. The moving carriage 40 is disposed at the lower side of the second guide rail 32 so that the moving carriage 40 is movable along the second guide rail 32. At the moving carriage 40 may be disposed a roller mechanism (not shown) movable along the second guide rail 32. The post frame 50 is fixed to the lower side of the moving carriage 40. The post frame 50 includes a plurality of posts connected to each other to form a telescopic structure. Consequently, the length of the post frame 50 may increase or decrease in the vertical direction of the inspection room in a state in which the post frame 50 is fixed to the moving carriage 40. The X-ray irradiator 10 generates and radiates X-rays toward the subject. The X-ray irradiator 10 includes an X-ray tube 11 to generate X-rays and a collimator 72 to guide the generated X-rays toward the subject. The high voltage generator 20 generates high voltage to generate X-rays. The high voltage generator 20 is connected to the X-ray irradiator 10 so that high voltage generated by the high voltage generator 20 is supplied to the X-ray irradiator 10. When high voltage is supplied to the X-ray irradiator 10, X-rays are generated by collision between thermal electrons in the X-ray tube 11. The generated X-rays are radiated toward the subject via the collimator 12. A rotary joint 60 is disposed between the X-ray irradiator 10 and the post frame 50. The rotary joint 60 couples the X-ray irradiator 10 to the post frame 50 and supports load applied to the X-ray irradiator 10. The rotary joint 60 includes a first rotary joint 62 connected to the lower end of the post frame 50 and a second rotary joint 61 connected to the X-ray irradiator 10. The second rotary joint 61 is disposed so as to be rotatable on a plane perpendicular to the ceiling of the inspection room. The first rotary joint 62 is disposed so as to be rotatable about the central axis of the post frame 50 extending in the vertical direction of the inspection room. The drive device 70 provides drive force to shift/move the position of the X-ray irradiator 10 within the inspection room. The drive device 70 may be an electric motor. The drive device 70 may include a plurality of drive devices connected to the second guide rail 32, the post frame 50 and the rotary joint 60. The drive devices 70 may be disposed at various positions in consideration of design convenience. For example, a drive device to move the second guide rail 32 may be disposed near the first guide rail 31, a drive device to shift the moving carriage 40 may be disposed near the second guide rail 32, and a drive device to increase or decrease the length of the post frame 50 may be disposed in the moving carriage 40. Also, a drive device to rotate the X-ray irradiator 10 may be disposed near the rotary joint 60. The drive device 70 may be connected to a power transmission unit (not shown), by which the drive devices 70 linearly move or rotate the X-ray irradiator 10 so as to controllably change the position of the X-ray irradiator 10 within the inspection room or the direction in which the X-ray irradiator 10 radiates X-rays. The power transmission unit (not shown) may include a belt and pulley, a chain and sprocket, and a shaft, which are generally well known to be used to provide power transmission of this type. The X-ray irradiator 10 may be provided with a shift grip 80 configured to be held by an inspector/operator of the radiographic apparatus 1. The shift grip 80 is fixed to the X-ray irradiator 10. The inspector may apply force or torque to the shift grip 80 while holding the shift grip 80 to manually shift the X-ray irradiator 10. The controller 3 is connected to the components of the capturing device 2 to control the components of the capturing device 2. The controller 3 may include a computer connected to the components of the capturing device 2 through a wired interface. For example, the controller 3 may be connected to the drive device 70 to control the drive device to shift the X-ray irradiator 10 to a desired position. Also, the controller 3 may be connected to the high voltage generator 20 to control the high voltage generator 20 to generate high voltage to generate X-rays. The inspector may input set values for the components of the capturing device 2 and then manipulate the components of the capturing device 2. Accordingly, the radiographic apparatus 1 includes a manipulation device to allow the inspector to input commands to control the capturing device 2. The manipulation device is connected to the controller 3. The manipulation device is mounted to one of the components of the capturing device 2. Generally, the manipulation device is mounted to the X-ray irradiator 10 in consideration of a pattern of movement of the inspector while in the inspection room. However, if the manipulation device is fixedly mounted to the X-ray irradiator 10, the position of the manipulation device would be changed when the position of the X-ray irradiator 10 is changed. As a result, the manipulation device may be beyond the inspector's reach or may be located where manipulation of the manipulation device by the inspector is difficult. For this reason, in accordance with one aspect of the invention, the radiographic apparatus 1 includes a detachable manipulation device which is connected to the controller 3 in a wireless fashion using a wireless interface while in a state in which the manipulation device is separated from the capturing device 2. FIGS. 2A and 2B are views showing a detachable manipulation device 100 of the radiographic apparatus according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, the manipulation device 100 includes a case 101 open at one side thereof and a manipulation panel 102 disposed at the open side of the case 101. The manipulation panel 102 may include a display panel to display states of the components of the capturing device 2 and a touch panel to allow the inspector to input commands by touch. Manipulation may be input using various manners in addition to touch. For example, a button may be used to input commands. Also, the manipulation device 100 may include a mobile device, such as a tablet PC. A docking device 200 is disposed at one side of the X-ray irradiator 10. The manipulation device 100 is fixedly mounted to the docking device 200. The docking device 200 is connected to the controller 3 shown in FIG. 1. The docking device 200 includes a mount hole 201 formed in a shape corresponding to the manipulation device 100 and fixing protrusions 202 to fix the manipulation device 100. In a state in which the manipulation device 100 is mounted to the docking device 200, power from the docking device 200 is supplied to the manipulation device 100. In this case, the manipulation device 100 is connected to the docking device 200 through a wired interface. In a state in which the manipulation device 100 is separated from the docking device 200, power from a battery provided in the manipulation device 100 is supplied to the manipulation device 100. In this case, the manipulation device 100 is connected to the docking device 200 through a wireless interface. Consequently, it may be possible for the inspector to manipulate the components of the capturing device 2 irrespective of where the X-ray irradiator 10 is located. Details of the manipulation device 100 and the docking device 200 are described next. FIG. 3 is a view illustrating the construction of the manipulation device and the docking device of the radiographic apparatus 1 according to an embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 4 is a view illustrating the construction of an input unit of the manipulation device of the radiographic apparatus 1 according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 3, the manipulation device 100 includes a display unit 110 to display states of the components of the capturing device 2, an input unit 120 to allow the inspector to input commands, a battery unit 130 to supply power to the manipulation device 100 in a state in which the manipulation device 100 is separated from the docking device 200, and a first wired connection unit 140 and first wireless connection unit 150 connected to the docking device 200. The docking device 200 includes a power supply unit 210 to supply power to the manipulation device 100 and to charge the battery unit 130 of the manipulation device 100, and a second wired connection unit 220 and second wireless connection unit 230 connected to the manipulation device 100. The display unit 110 displays states of set values of the components of the capturing device 2. The display unit 100 may include a display panel. The input unit 120 allows the inspector to input commands to control the components of the capturing device 2. The input unit 120 may include a touch panel or buttons, as previously noted. The details of the input unit 120 will be described later. When the manipulation device 100 is mounted to the docking device 200, the first wired connection unit 140 is connected to the second wired connection unit 220 of the docking device 200. When the first wired connection unit 140 is connected to the second wired connection unit 220, an electric signal to control the capturing device 2 is transmitted and received between the manipulation device 100 and the docking device 200 using a wired interface. The wired interface may include serial communication, such as RS232, RS422 and RS485, USB, IEEE1394 and LAN. However, the wired interface may also include various wired communication modes using wired communication modules. When the manipulation device 100 is mounted to the docking device 200, the battery unit 100 of the manipulation device 100 is connected to the power supply unit 210 of the docking device 200. The battery unit 130 is charged with power supplied from the power supply unit 210. The battery unit 130 is charged using general charging methods. The first wired connection unit 140 of the manipulation device 100 and the second wired connection unit 220 of the docking device 200 may include connectors through which the first wired connection unit 140 and the second wired connection unit 220 are connected to each other. Also, the battery unit 130 of the manipulation device 100 and the power supply unit 210 of the docking device 200 may include connectors through which the first wired connection unit 140 and the second wired connection unit 220 are connected to each other. The first wired connection unit 140 and the battery unit 130 of the manipulation device 100 may not include individual connectors but a single connector. In the same manner, the second wired connection unit 220 and the power supply unit 210 of the docking device 200 may not include individual connectors but a single connector. When the manipulation device 100 is separated from the docking device 200, power from the battery unit 130 is supplied to the manipulation device 100. At this time, the first wireless connection unit 150 of the manipulation device 100 is connected to the second wireless connection unit 230 of the docking device 200 using a wireless interface. When the first wireless connection unit 150 is connected to the second wireless connection unit 230, an electric signal to control the capturing device 2 is transmitted and received between the manipulation device 100 and the docking device 200 using the wireless interface. The wireless interface may include infrared (IR) communication, radio frequency (RF) communication, Bluetooth communication, Wi-Fi communication and wireless USB communication. However, the wireless interface may also include various wireless communication modes using wireless communication modules. In the above description, the second wireless connection unit 230 is provided at the docking device 200. However, the second wireless connection unit 230 may be provided as a separate device or as a part of the controller 3. As shown in FIG. 4, the input unit 120 includes a shift manipulation unit 121 to input a position for the X-ray irradiator 10 and direction for the radiation of its X-rays, a high voltage setting unit 122 to set a value of high voltage to generate the X-rays, a high voltage generation unit 123 to input commands to generate the high voltage, and an inspector authentication unit 124 to authenticate an inspector/operator of the radiographic unit 1. The shift manipulation unit 121 allows the inspector to input commands to control the drive device 70 to shift the X-ray irradiator 10 to a desired set position to at which X-rays are to be generated and to a desired set direction in which the X-rays are to be radiated from the X-ray irradiator 10 towards the subject. The inspector may manually input shift direction (via rotation control of pivot unit 60) and shift position (via distance control of guide rail 30, carriage 40 and post frame 50) by control of the drive device 70 through the shift manipulation unit 121. Alternatively, the inspector may set frequently used X-ray radiation positions and directions in a macro form through the shift manipulation unit 121 and may shift the X-ray irradiator 10 to a predetermined position and direction through one input. The high voltage setting unit 122 allows the inspector to set a value of high voltage of the high voltage generator 20. The high voltage generation unit 123 allows the inspector to input commands to control the high voltage generator 20 to supply high voltage to the X-ray irradiator 10. Since the manipulation device 100 is connected to the docking device 200 using the wireless interface, a particular advantage of the present invention is that it allows the inspector to control the high voltage generator 20 from outside the inspection room so that the inspector is not exposed to radiation, yet, while the inspector is inside the room, has direct access (that is, close contact) with the patient and the radiographic apparatus 1 so as to ensure that the position of the X-ray irradiator 10 is accurately set. The inspector authentication unit 124 allows the inspector/operator of the radiographic apparatus 1 to input his/her identification and password. When the inspector wishes to mount or separate the manipulation device 100 to or from the docking device 200 during the radiographic operation, the inspector may input his/her identification and password through the inspector authentication unit 124, thereby preventing the radiographic operation from being performed by an unauthorized person. Thus, with the present invention, duplicate controls for setting and initiating a radiographic operation are not required, thereby preventing someone else from manipulating a duplicate control and causing premature operation of the radiographic apparatus 1. FIGS. 5 and 6 are views showing a manipulation device 100 and a docking device 300 of a radiographic apparatus according to another embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, the docking device 300 includes a mounting unit 310 to which the manipulation device 100 is mounted and a rotary unit 320 rotatably coupled to an X-ray irradiator 10. The rotary unit 320 includes rotary protrusions coupled to rotary grooves 13 provided at the X-ray irradiator 10. The rotary protrusions may be electrically connected to the rotary grooves 13. The mounting unit 310 includes a mount hole 311 formed in a shape corresponding to the manipulation device 100 so that the manipulation device 100 can be mounted in the mount hole 311 and fixing protrusions 312 to fix the manipulation device 100 to mounting unit 310. When the manipulation device 100 is mounted in the mount hole 311, the manipulation device 100 is electrically connected to the docking device 300. When the manipulation device 100 is mounted to the docking device 300, the manipulation device 100 is rotatable along with the docking device 300. Consequently, it may be possible for the inspector to rotate the manipulation device 100 to a position at which easy input is performed. As is apparent from the above description, the manipulation device may be detachably mounted to the capturing device and may be connected to the components of the capturing device in a wireless fashion. Consequently, it may be possible for the inspector to manipulate the component of the capturing device irrespective of where the capturing device is located and to also prevent a radiographic operation from being performed by an unauthorized person.
