The locating arrangement 18 further includes a fastening assembly 148 (see Figures 2, 3 and 8 to 10) to fasten the locating arrangement to the datum screw 14. In order to drive the datum screw 14 into the iliac crest of the patient, a drive arrangement 162 is provided (see Figures 14 to 16), which comprises a drive fitment 164 to be connected to a power tool, and a further fastening assembly 248, which is generally the same as the first mentioned fastening assembly 148, and operates in the same way. The fastening assemblies 148 and 248 are described in detail below. The drive fitment 164 includes a drive member 166 having a hexagonally shaped profile, which is received in the hexagonal key receiving recess 46 to drive the datum screw 14. The drive fitment 164 also includes a mounting member 167 to mount the drive fitment on a power tool (not shown) to drive the datum screw 14 into the bone. Referring back to Figures 1 and 4 to 7, when the locating arrangement 18 is received in the main hole 36 of the holding member 22, it can be secured therein by the first securing screw 24. The threaded aperture 28 overlaps the main hole 36 so that the shank of the first securing screw 24 engages the elongate generally rectangular post 38, thereby securing the locating arrangement 18 to the holding member 22 of the securing assembly 16. It will be appreciated that the holding member 22 can be slid up and down the elongate generally rectangular post 38. When the desired position of the holding member 22 has been selected, the first securing screw 24 can be screwed into the threaded aperture 28 to engage the elongate generally rectangular post 38 to secure the locating arrangement 18 to the holding member 22. Referring to Figures 1, 17 and 18, the surgical positioning device 12 further includes an extension member in the form of an elongate arm 48. An adjustable indicating arrangement 250 is mounted at one end region of the elongate arm 48. The indicating arrangement comprises a movable indicating member 252, which is movable relative to the elongate arm 48 between a first position shown in Figure 17 and a second position shown in Figure 18. This allows the surgical positioning device 12 to accommodate differing anatomies of different patients. The securing assembly 16 further includes a locking arrangement 254 to lock the indicating member 252 in its first or second positions. The locking arrangement 254 comprises a fixed member 256 mounted on the elongate arm 48. The fixed member 256 defines an aperture 258 through which the indicating member 252 can be received. The fixed member 256 also has a co-operating collar 257 to cooperate with locking formations on the indicating member 252, as explained below. The fixed member 256 has an externally threaded end portion on which an internally threaded locking member 259 can be screwed. The locking member 259 may comprise a nut. The indicating member 252 defines locking formations in the form of first and second indentations 260, 262 defined in the indicating member 252. The first and second indentations 260, 262 help secure the indicating member 252 in the first or second position. The elongate arm 48 defines a positioning slot 54 which extends along a major proportion of the length of the elongate arm 48. A guide member 56 is provided on the holding member 22. The guide member 56 comprises an outwardly extending guide portion 58 and a connecting portion 60 to connect the guide portion 58 to the holding member 22. In use, the holding member 22 and the guide member 56 are arranged such that the guide portion 58 is arranged to extend across an upper surface of the elongate arm 48, with the holding member 22 arranged beneath the elongate arm 48. The connecting portion 60 extends from the guide portion 58 to the holding member 22 through the positioning slot 54. The guide portion 58 has a width G, which is less than the width S of the positioning slot 54 in the elongate arm 48. Thus, the guide portion 58 can be inserted through the positioning slot 54 and then twisted to its position shown in Figure 2. During total hip replacement surgery the placement of the femoral and acetabular implant will change the medial/lateral and proximal/distal position of the joint centre of rotation which may affect leg length and offset. During surgery, as described above, the positioning apparatus 10 is arranged on the datum screw 14 in the patient's iliac crest, and the various components are fixed in the appropriate positions relative to the positions of the patient's bones. When the components of the positioning apparatus 10 have been so fixed, the positioning apparatus 10 is removed, and placed to one side for use after the surgery is finished. After completion of the surgery, it is necessary to arrange the positioning apparatus back on the datum screw 14 in the patient's iliac crest. However, it is likely that the patient will have moved during surgery, and it is important that the positioning apparatus 10 and the patient are in the same position as they were before surgery. To this end, a levelling device 310 as described below is used. The levelling device 310 is shown in Figures 19, 20 and 22, and comprises a levelling member 312, a carrier 314 for carrying the levelling member 312, and a support 316 for supporting the carrier 314. The levelling device 310 further includes a securing arrangement 318 which secures the carrier 314 to the support 316. The carrier 314 is of a generally C shaped configuration, having a lower region 320 and an upper region 322. The levelling member 312 is suspended from the upper region 322 in a manner that allows three dimensional pendulous motion of the levelling member 312 relative to the carrier 314. The lower region 320 of the carrier 314 includes an indicator portion 324, in the form of a cone shaped member, the purpose of which is explained below. The levelling member 312 comprises an elongate rod 328 pivotally mounted at the upper region 322 of the carrier 314, and a weight 330 at the lower end of the elongate member 328. The elongate rod 328 has a ball member 370 at its upper end, which is received in a recess 372 in the upper region of the carrier 314. The ball member is held in the recess by a holding member 374, comprising a wider disc shaped member 376, and a depending threaded member 378 which is threadably received in a threaded aperture 380 adjacent the recess 372. The disc shaped member 376 extends over the recess 372, thereby preventing inadvertent removal or dislodging of the ball member 370 in the recess 372. The weight 330 comprises an indicator portion in the form of an inverted conical member 332. The inverted conical member 332 is provided to indicate that the carrier 314 is vertical when the inverted conical member 332 is aligned with the indicator portion 324. The support 316 comprises a hollow body 334, which defines an inner chamber 336 having tapering upper walls 337. The inner chamber 336 is represented by broken lines in Figure 21. The securing arrangement comprises a securing member 338 defining a recess 340. The securing member 338 is received in the chamber 336 of the body 334. The recess 340 has a V shaped profile. The securing member 338 is moveable up and down, in the direction as shown by the double headed arrow 342 by rotation of a first turning member 344. The first turning member 344 is fixedly mounted on the hollow body 334. The hollow body 334 and the securing member 338 are correspondingly threaded so that the rotation of the turning member 344 in a direction into or out of the paper causes the hollow body 334 to rotate, which in turn moves the securing member 338 in one of the directions shown by the arrow 342, depending upon which way the first turning member 344 is turned. A positioning member 346, in the form of a ball member is mounted on the lower region 320 of the carrier 314 by a substantially cylindrical shank 348. The positioning member 346 is received within the chamber 336 and can be received by the recess 340 in the securing member 338. The securing member 338 can be moved upwardly by turning the turning member 344. This movement of the securing member 338 causes the securing member 338 to engage the positioning member 346 and push the positioning member 346 against the tapering wall 337 of the chamber 336. Thus, the positioning member 346 is secured against the tapering upper walls 337 within the chamber 336 in a desired position. The positioning member 346 can be released by turning the turning member 344 in the opposite direction to move the securing member 338 downwardly, thereby disengaging the securing member 338 from the positioning member 346. This allows the position of the carrier 314 to be adjusted to a further position. The carrier 314 can then be secured in the further position by turning the turning member 344 so that the securing member 338 again engages the spherical member 346 to secure the spherical member 346 between the securing member 338 and the tapering wall 337. The support 316 further includes a downwardly extending connecting portion 350 defining an internally threaded chamber 352. A second turning member 360 is fixedly mounted on the securing member 338, which also has a threaded depending member 362 thereon. The depending member 362 extends into the chamber 352, and threadably engages the internal threads therein. Turning of the second turning member 360 moves the securing member 338 in either direction indicated by the double headed arrow 342 relative to the connecting portion 350. The connecting portion 350 has a fastening assembly 390 mounted thereon. The fastening assembly 390 connects the levelling device 310 to a further article, for example a surgical apparatus, or a marker, which can be inserted into a patient's bone. The fastening assembly 390 is the same as the fastening assemblies 148 and 248, and are described below. Where the description below describes a feature with reference to only one of the fastening assemblies, it will be appreciated that the other fastening assemblies also have that feature. Each of the fastening assemblies 148, 248 and 390 comprise a flange 150 defining two curved slots 152 opposite each other. The flange 150 is fixedly mounted on the locating post 38 and extends radially outwardly therefrom. In the case of the further fastening assembly 248, the flange 150 is fixedly mounted on the drive fitment 164. In the case of the fastening assembly 390, the flange 150 is fixedly mounted on the connecting portion 350. The fastening assembly 148 further includes a sleeve member 154 (see Figure 12) which defines a hole 155 therethrough to slidably mount the sleeve member 154 around the locating post 38, and a pair of fingers 156 extend from the sleeve member 154. Each finger 156 extends through a respective one of the curved slots 152. A detent formation 158 is provided on, and extends inwardly from, each finger 156. The sleeve member 154 has a radially outwardly extending lip 159 extending therefrom. Urging means in the form of a spring 161 is arranged between the lip 159 and the flange 150. Referring to Figure 13, the upper region of the datum screw 14 defines co-operating recesses 160, arranged opposite each other. The co-operating recesses 160 are generally J-shaped, and are configured to cooperate with the detent formations 158 in the manner of a bayonet type fitting, to fasten the locating arrangement 18, the drive arrangement 162 or the levelling device 310, to the datum screw 14. The spring 161 urges the lip 159 away from the flange 150, and thus assists in fastening the datum screw 14 to the locating arrangement 18, the drive arrangement, or the levelling device 310. The above described surgical positioning apparatus 10 incorporating the levelling device 310 provides an initial datum measurement of the joint positioning prior to cutting the bone, and allows corrections to be made to alter the datum position according to estimates made from the x-rays prior to surgery. Then the patient's physiology can be adjusted using the trials/implants to meet the positioning shown by the surgical positioning apparatus 10. An embodiment of a surgical positioning apparatus according to the invention is shown in Figures 23 to 30. The surgical positioning apparatus shown in Figure 23 is generally designated 400. The surgical positioning apparatus 400 comprises a surgical positioning device 412 and a marker element, in the form of a datum screw 414. The surgical positioning device 412 comprises a securing assembly 416, a locating arrangement 418, and an adjustable indicating arrangement 420. A levelling device 422 is provided on the locating arrangement 418. Reference is now made to Figure 24, which shows the surgical positioning device 412 and the securing assembly 416. The surgical positioning device 412 comprises an elongate arm 484 having the adjustable indicating arrangement 420 mounted thereon. The indicating arrangement comprises a movable indicating member 488, which defines upper and lower notches 490, 492 to allow the position of the indicating member to be moved relative to the elongate arm 484 between first and second indicating positions. A fastening lever 494 is pivotally mounted at the end region, constituting a fixed portion 496, of the elongate arm 484. The fastening lever 494 has a cam member 498 thereon which engages the indicating member 488 when the fastening lever 494 is moved from a non-fastening position to a fastening position. In Figure 23, the fastening lever 494 is in the fastening position, in which the cam member 498 pushes the indicating member 488 against a wall 500, thereby clamping the indicating member against the wall 500. The securing assembly 416 comprises a first holding member in the form of a lower holding member 502 mounted beneath the elongate arm 484. The elongate arm defines an elongate slot 504 extending along a major proportion of the length of the elongate arm 484. The lower portion 502 has front and rear projecting connection members 506, 507 which project through the slot 504 when the lower portion 502 is mounted on the elongate arm 484. The securing assembly 416 also includes a second holding member, in the form of an upper holding member 508. The upper holding member 508 is mounted on top of the elongate arm 484. The front and rear connecting members 506, 507 include first detent formations 510 that cooperate with second formations 512 on the upper holding member 508 to secure the upper and lower holding members 502, 508 to each other and, thereby, to the elongate arm 484. A securing lever 514 is pivotally mounted on the rear connecting member 507, and includes a cam member 516. A flap member 518 is pivotally mounted on the upper holding member 508. The cam member 516 engages the flap member 518 and, when the lever 514 is moved to a clamping position, the cam member 516 pushes the flap member 518 onto the elongate arm 484. This clamps the flap member 518 against the elongate arm 484, thereby securing the securing assembly 416, and hence the locating arrangement, in a desired position along the arm 484. The lower holding member 502 defines a passage 520 for a locking slide 522. The locking slide defines a rectangular aperture 524, through which the locating post 432 extends. The upper and lower holding members 502, 508 also define H-shaped apertures 526, being of a corresponding shape to the cross-sectional profile of the locating post 432. When the locking slide 522 is centrally arranged within the passage 520, the locating post can slide up and down within the apertures 526. However, when the locking slide 522 is pushed to a locking position at one side within the passage 520, it engages the locating post 432, thereby securing the locating post 432 in a desired position. The locating post 432 has a plurality of securing formations in the form of serrations 528 (see Figure 25). The locking slide 522 has a projecting formation 529 which extends into the aperture 524. When the locking slide is moved to its locking position, the projecting formation 529 engages the serrations 528, thereby locking the locating post 432 in a desired position. Figure 25 shows the locating arrangement 418, which comprises an elongate locating member in the form of a locating post 432, which is graduated by markings 434 in millimetres. The locating post 432 has an H-shaped cross-sectional profile, as shown. A fastening assembly 436 is provided at the lower end of the locating post 432. The fastening assembly 436 comprises a clamping arrangement 438 comprising a first clamping member 440 pivotally attached to a second clamping member 442 at a main pivot 444. The second clamping member 442 is fixedly attached to the locating post 432. A fastening link 446 is pivotally attached at one end 447 thereof to a first pivot member 448 on the first clamping member 440 opposite the main pivot 444. The opposite end 449 of the fastening link 446 is pivotally attached to a proximal pivot member 450 on a lever 452. The lever 452 also has a distal pivot member 454, adjacent the proximal pivot member 450. The distal pivot member 454 pivotally attaches the lever 452 to a second pivot member 456 on the second clamping member opposite the main pivot 444. The lever 452 is pivotally movable between a clamping position (shown in Figure 23), in which the first and second clamping members are pulled against one another, and a released position (not shown), in which the clamping members are moved apart from one another. Figure 25 also shows the components of the levelling device 422, which comprise a cylindrical holder 424 and a cylindrical liquid filled member in the form of a spirit level 426. The spirit level 426 comprise a transparent wall in the form of an upper cover 428 made of a transparent material such as glass or clear plastic. A marked region in the form of a circular marking 429 is provided on the cover 428 at a central region thereof. The spirit level 426 contains a liquid in which an air bubble is contained. When the spirit level 426 is upright, the air bubble is aligned with the circular marking 429. The levelling device 422 is attached to the locating post 432 by a clip 430 which clips onto an engaging bar 431 on the locating post 432. Referring to Figure 26, the fastening assembly 436 is used to clamp a clampable member, in the form of a ball member 458, which is provided on a location body 460. The ball member 458 is provided in two ball portions 458A and 458B, which are mounted around an upper mounting portion in the form of a spigot 459. The location body 460 comprises a lower marker engaging portion 462 and the spigot 459 upon which the ball member 458 is mounted. The marker engaging portion 462 defines opposed openings 463 and a pathway 464 communicating between the openings 463 through the marker engaging portion 462. The marker engaging portion 462 defines a recess (not shown) to receive the head 476. The pathway 464 extends through the recess. A locking member in the form of a locking plate 466 is received in the pathway 464 via the openings 463. The locking plate 466 defines an aperture 468 having a narrower section 470 and a wider section 472, and is slidable within the pathway 464 between locking and non-locking positions. The screw 414 has a threaded shank 474 and a head 476 having a wider securing portion 478 and a narrower neck portion 480. The marker engaging portion 462 defines a recess to receive the head 476. When the locking plate 466 is in its locking position, the narrower section 470 of the aperture 468 is disposed around the neck portion 480. The narrower section 470 is narrower than the securing portion 478, thereby securing the screw 414 to the location body 460. When the locking plate 466 is in its non-locking position, the larger section 472 of the aperture 468 is around the neck portion 480. The larger section 472 of the aperture 468 is wider than the securing portion 478, thereby allowing the securing portion to pass therethrough. The locking plate 466 has front and rear flange members 482 preventing inadvertent removal of the locking plate from the pathway 464. The securing portion 478 has a flat 483, and the recess in the marker engaging portion has a corresponding flat to ensure that the head 476 can be received in the marker engaging portion in only one orientation. Figure 27 and 28 show a drill guide 530, which comprises a drill guide handle 532 defining an aperture 534 at one end. The drill guide 530 also includes a drill guide insert 536 for insertion into the aperture 534, to be held by the handle 532, as shown in Figure 28.
