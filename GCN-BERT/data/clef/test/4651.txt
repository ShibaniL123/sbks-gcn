FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present application claims the priority of U.S. provisional patent application No. 61/289,538 filed Dec. 23, 2009 which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Embodiments of the invention comprise oligonucleotides modulating expression and/or function of UCP2 and associated molecules. BACKGROUND DNA-RNA and RNA-RNA hybridization are important to many aspects of nucleic acid function including DNA replication, transcription, and translation. Hybridization is also central to a variety of technologies that cither detect a particular nucleic acid or alter its expression. Antisense nucleotides, for example, disrupt gene expression by hybridizing to target RNA, thereby interfering with RNA splicing, transcription, translation, and replication. Antisense DNA has the added feature that DNA-RNA hybrids serve as a substrate for digestion by ribonuclease H, an activity that is present in most cell types. Antisense molecules can be delivered into cells, as is the case for oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), or they can be expressed from endogenous genes as RNA molecules. The FDA recently approved an antisense drug, VITRAVENE™ (for treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis), reflecting that antisense has therapeutic utility. SUMMARY This Summary is provided to present a summary of the invention to briefly indicate the nature and substance of the invention, it is submitted with the understanding that it will not be used to interpret or limit the scope or meaning of the claims. In one embodiment, the invention provides methods for inhibiting the action of a natural antisense transcript by using antisense oligonucleotides) targeted to my region of the natural antisense transcript resulting in up-regulation of the corresponding sense gene.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Several aspects of the invention are described below with reference to example applications for illustration. It should be understood that numerous specific details, relationships, and methods are set forth to provide a full understanding of the invention. One having ordinary skill in the relevant art, however, will readily recognize that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods. The present invention is not limited by the ordering of acts or events, as some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts or events. Furthermore, not all illustrated acts or events are required to implement a methodology in accordance with the present invention. All genes, gene names, and gene products disclosed herein are intended to correspond to homologs from any species for which the compositions and methods disclosed herein are applicable. Thus, the terms include, but are not limited to genes and gene products from humans and mice. It is understood that when a gene or gene product from a particular species is disclosed, this disclosure is intended to be exemplary only, and is not to be interpreted as a limitation unless the context in which it appears clearly indicates. Thus, for example, for the genes disclosed herein, which in some embodiments relate to mammalian nucleic acid and amino acid sequences are intended to encompass homologous and/or orthologous genes and gene products from other animals including, but not limited to other mammals, fish, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. In an embodiment, the genes or nucleic acid sequences are human. Definitions The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms “a”, “an” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Furthermore, to the extent that the terms “including”, “includes”, “having”, “has”, “with”, or variants thereof are used in either the detailed description and/or the claims, such terms are intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term “comprising.” The term “about” or “approximately” means within an acceptable error range for the particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, which will depend in part on how the value is measured or determined, i.e., the limitations of the measurement system, for example, “about” can mean within 1 or more than 1 standard deviation, per the practice in the art. Alternatively, “about” can mean a range of up to 20%, preferably up to 10%, more preferably op to 5%, and more preferably still up to 1% of a given value. Alternatively, particularly with respect to biological systems or processes, the term can mean within an order of magnitude, preferably within 5-fold, and more preferably within 2-fold, of a value. Where particular values are described in the application and claims, unless otherwise stated the term “about” meaning within an acceptable error range for the particular value should be assumed. As used herein, the term “mRNA” means the presently known mRNA transcript(s) of a targeted gene, and any further transcripts which may be elucidated. By “antisense oligonucleotides” or “antisense compound” is meant an RNA or DNA molecule that binds to another RNA or DNA (target RNA, DNA). For example, if it is an RNA oligonucleotide it binds to another RNA target by means of RNA-RNA interactions and alters the activity of the target RNA. An antisense oligonucleotide can upregulate or downregulate expression and/or function of a particular polynucleotide. The definition is meant to include any foreign RNA or DNA molecule which is useful from a therapeutic, diagnostic, or other viewpoint. Such molecules include, for example, antisense RNA or DNA molecules, interference RNA (RNAi), micro RNA, decoy RNA molecules, siRNA, enzymatic RNA, therapeutic editing RNA and agonist and antagonist RNA, antisense oligomeric compounds, antisense oligonucleotides, external guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides, alternate splicers, primers, probes, and other oligomeric compounds that hybridize to at least a portion of the target nucleic acid. As such, these compounds may be introduced in the form of single-stranded, double-stranded, partially single-stranded, or circular oligomeric compounds. In the context of this invention, the term “oligonucleotide” refers to an oligomer or polymer of ribonucleic acid (RNA) or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or mimetics thereof. The term “oligonucleotide”, also includes linear or circular oligomers of natural and/or modified monomers or linkages, including deoxyribonucleosides, ribonucleosides, substituted and alpha-anomeric forms thereof, peptide nucleic acids (PNA), locked nucleic acids (LNA), phosphorothioate, methylphosphonate, and the like. Oligonucleotides are capable of specifically binding to a target polynucleotide by way of a regular pattern of monomer-monomer interactions, such as Watson-Crick type of base pairing, Hoögsteen or reverse Hoögsteen types of base pairing, or the like. The oligonucleotide may be “chimeric”, that is, composed of different regions. In the context of this invention “chimeric” compounds are oligonucleotides, which contain two or more chemical regions, for example, DNA region(s), RNA region(s), PNA region(s) etc. Each chemical region is made up of at least one monomer unit, i.e., a nucleotide in the case of an oligonucleotides compound. These oligonucleotides typically comprise at least one region wherein the oligonucleotide is modified in order to exhibit one or more desired properties. The desired properties of the oligonucleotide include, but are not limited, for example, to increased resistance to nuclease degradation, increased cellular uptake, and/or increased binding affinity for the target nucleic acid. Different regions of the oligonucleotide may therefore have different properties. The chimeric oligonucleotides of the present invention can be formed as mixed structures of two or more oligonucleotides, modified oligonucleotides, oligonucleosides and/or oligonucleotide analogs as described above. The oligonucleotide can be composed of regions that can be linked in “register”, that is, when the monomers are linked consecutively, as in native DNA, or linked via spacers. The spacers are intended to constitute a covalent “bridge” between the regions and have in preferred cases a length not exceeding about 100 carbon atoms. The spacers may carry different functionalities, for example, having positive or negative charge, carry special nucleic acid binding properties (intercalators, groove binders, toxins, fluorophors etc.), being lipophilic, inducing special secondary structures like, for example, alanine containing peptides that induce alpha-helices. As used herein “UCP2” and “Uncoupling Protein 2” are inclusive of all family members, mutants, alleles, fragments, species, coding and noncoding sequences, sense and antisense polynucleotide strands, etc. As used herein, the words Uncoupling protein 2, UCP2, BMIQ4, Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2, SLC25A8, UCP 2, UCPH, uncoupling protein 2 (mitochondrial proton carrier) are considered the same in the literature and are used interchangeably in the present application. As used herein, the term “oligonucleotide specific for” or “oligonucleotide which targets” refers to an oligonucleotide having a sequence (i) capable of forming a stable complex with a portion of the targeted gene, or (ii) capable of forming a stable duplex with a portion of a mRNA transcript of the targeted gene. Stability of the complexes and duplexes can be determined by theoretical calculations and/or in vitro assays. Exemplary assays for determining stability of hybridization complexes and duplexes are described in the Examples below. As used herein, the term “target nucleic acid” encompasses DNA, RNA (composing premRNA and mRNA) transcribed from such DNA, and also cDNA derived from such RNA, coding, noncoding sequences, sense or antisense polynucleotides. The specific hybridization of an oligomeric compound with its target nucleic acid interferes with the normal function of the nucleic acid. This modulation of function of a target nucleic acid by compounds, which specifically hybridize to it, is generally referred to as “antisense”. The functions of DNA to be interfered include, for example, replication and transcription. The functions of RNA to be interfered, include all vital functions such as, for example, translocation of the RNA to the site of protein translation, translation of protein from the RNA, splicing of the RNA to yield one or more mRNA species, and catalytic activity which may be engaged in or facilitated by the RNA. The overall effect of such interference with target nucleic acid function is modulation of the expression of an encoded product or oligonucleotides. RNA interference “RNAi” is mediated by double stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules that have sequence-specific homology to their “target” nucleic acid sequences. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the mediators are 5-25 nucleotide “small interfering” RNA duplexes (siRNAs). The siRNAs are derived from the processing of dsRNA by an RNase enzyme known as Dicer. siRNA duplex products are recruited into a multi-protein siRNA complex termed RISC (RNA Induced Silencing Complex). Without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, a RISC is then believed to be guided to a target nucleic acid (suitably mRNA), where the siRNA duplex interacts in a sequence-specific way to mediate cleavage in a catalytic fashion. Small interfering RNAs that can be used in accordance with the present invention can be synthesized and used according to procedures that are well known in the art and that will be familiar to the ordinarily skilled artisan. Small interfering RNAs for use in the methods of the present invention suitably comprise between about 1 to about 50 nucleotides (nt). In examples of non limiting embodiments, siRNAs can comprise about 5 to about 40 nt, about 5 to about 30 nt, about 10 to about 30 nt, about 15 to about 25 nt, or about 20-25 nucleotides. Selection of appropriate oligonucleotides is facilitated by using computer programs that automatically align nucleic acid sequences and indicate regions of identity or homology. Such programs are used to compare nucleic acid sequences obtained, for example, by searching databases such as GenBank or by sequencing PCR products. Comparison of nucleic acid sequences from a range of species allows the selection of nucleic acid sequences that display an appropriate degree of identity between species. In the case of genes that have not been sequenced, Southern blots are performed to allow a determination of the degree of identity between genes in target species and other species. By performing Southern blots at varying degrees of stringency, as is well known in the art it is possible to obtain an approximate measure of identity. These procedures allow the selection of oligonucleotides that exhibit a high degree of complementarity to target nucleic acid sequences in a subject to be controlled and a lower degree of complementarity to corresponding nucleic acid sequences in other species. One skilled in the art will realize that there is considerable latitude in selecting appropriate regions of genes for use in the present invention. By “enzymatic RNA” is meant an RNA molecule with enzymatic activity (Cech, (1988) J. American. Med. Assoc. 260, 3030-3035). Enzymatic nucleic acids (ribozymes) act by first binding to a target RNA. Such binding occurs through the target binding portion of an enzymatic nucleic acid which is held in close proximity to an enzymatic portion of the molecule that acts to cleave the target RNA. Thus, the enzymatic nucleic acid first recognizes and then binds a target RNA through base pairing, and once bound to the correct site, acts enzymatically to cut the target RNA. By “decoy RNA” is meant an RNA molecule that mimics the natural binding domain for a ligand. The decoy RNA therefore competes with natural binding target for the binding of a specific ligand. For example, it has been shown that over-expression of HIV trans-activation response (TAR) RNA can act as a “decoy” and efficiently binds HIV tat protein, thereby preventing it from binding to TAR sequences encoded in the HIV RNA. This is meant to be a specific example. Those in the art will recognize that this is but one example, and other embodiments can be readily generated using techniques generally known in the art. As used herein, the term “monomers” typically indicates monomers linked by phosphodiester bonds or analogs thereof to form oligonucleotides ranging in size from a few monomeric units, e.g., from about 3-4, to about several hundreds of monomeric units. Analogs of phosphodiester linkages include: phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate, methylphosphomates, phosphoroselenoate, phosphoramidate, and the like, as more fully described below. The term “nucleotide” covers naturally occurring nucleotides as well as nonnaturally occurring nucleotides. It should be clear to the person skilled in the art that various nucleotides which previously have been considered “non-naturally occurring” have subsequently been found in nature. Thus, “nucleotides” includes not only the known purine and pyrrolidine heterocycles-containing molecules, but also heterocyclic analogues and tautomers thereof. Illustrative examples of other types of nucleotides are molecules containing adenine, guanine, thymine, cytosine, uracil, purine, xanthine, diaminopurine, 8-oxo-N6-methyladenine, 7-deazaxanthine, 7-deaxaguanin, N4,N4-ethanocytosin, N6,N6-ethano-2,6- diaminopurine, 5-methyletosine, 5-(C3-C6)-alkynylcytosine, 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, pscudoisocytosine, 2-hydroxy-5-methyl-triaalopyridin, isocytostne, isoguanin, inosine and the “non-naturally occurring” nucleotides described in Benner et. al., U.S. Pat No. 3,432,272, The term “nucleotide” is intended to cover every and all of these examples as well as analogues and tautomers thereof. Especially interesting nucleotides are those containing adenine, guanine, thymine, cytosine, and uracil, which are considered as the naturally occurring nucleotides in relation to therapeutic and diagnostic application in humans. Nucleotides include the natural 2′-dcoxy and 2′-hydroxyl sugars, e.g., as described in Kornberg and Baker, DNA Replication, 2nd Ed. (Freeman, San Francisco, 1992) as well as their analogs. “Analogs” in reference to nucleotides includes synthetic nucleotides having modified base moieties and/or modified sugar moieties (see e.g., described generally by Scheit, Nucleotide Analogs, John Wiley, New York, 1990; Freier & Altmann, (1997) Nucli. Acid. Res. 25(22), 4429-4443, Toulmé, J. J., (2001) Nature Biotechnology 19:17-18, Manoharan M. (1999) Biochemica et Biophystca Acta 1489:117-139; Freier S. M., (1997) Nucleic Acid Research, 25:4429-4443. Uhlman, E., (2000) Drug Discovery & Development, 3: 203-213, Herdewin P., (2000) Antisense & Nucleic Acul Drug Dev., 10:297-310), S′-O, 3′C-linked [3.2.0] bicycloarabinonucleasides. Such analogs include synthetic nucleotides designed to enhance binding properties, e.g., duplex or triplex stability, specificity, or the like. As used herein, “hybridization” means the pairing of substantially complementary strands of oligomeric compounds. One mechanism of pairing involves hydrogen bonding, which may be Watson-Crick, Hoögsteen or reversed Hoögsteen hydrogen bonding, between complementary nucleoside or nucleotide bases (nucleotides) of the strands of oligomeric compounds. For example, adenine and thymine are complementary nucleotides which pair through the formation of hydrogen bonds. Hybridization can occur under varying circumstances. An antisense compound is “specifically hybridizable” when binding of the compound to the target nucleic acid interferes with the normal function of the target nucleic acid to cause a modulation of function and/or activity, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the antisense compound to non-target nucleic acid sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, and under conditions in which assays are performed in the ease of in vitro assays. As used herein, the phrase “stringent hybridization conditions” or “stringent conditions” refers to conditions under which a compound of the invention will hybridize to its target sequence, but to a minimal number of other sequences. Stringent conditions are sequence-dependent and will be different in different circumstances and in the context of this invention, “stringent conditions” under which oligomeric compounds hybridize to a target sequence are determined by the nature and composition of the oligomeric compounds and the assays in which they are being investigated. In general, stringent hybridization conditions comprise low concentrations (<0.15M) of salts with inorganic cations such as Na++ or K++ (i.e., low ionic strength), temperature higher than 20° C.-25° C. below the Tm of the oligomeric compound:target sequence complex, and the presence of denaturants such as formamide, dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, or the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). For example, the hybridization rate decreases 1.1% for each 1% formamnide. An example of a high stringency hybridization condition is 0.1× sodium chloride-sodium citrate buffer (SSC)/0.1% (w/v) SDS at 60° C. for 10 minutes. “Complementary,” as used herein, refers to the capacity for precise pairing between two nucleotides on one or two oligomeric strands. For example, if a nucleobase at a certain position of an antisense compound is capable of hydrogen bonding with a nucleobase at a certain position of a target nucleic acid, said target nucleic acid being a DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotide molecule, then the position of hydrogen bonding between the oligonucleotide and the target nucleic acid is considered to be a complementary position. The oligomeric compound and the further DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotide molecule are complementary to each other when a sufficient number of complementary positions in each molecule are occupied by nucleotides which can hydrogen bond with each other. Thus, “specifically hybridizable” and “complementary” are icons which are used to indicate a sufficient degree of precise pairing or complementarity over a sufficient number of nucleotides such that stable and specific binding occurs between the oligomeric compound and a target nucleic acid. It is understood in the art that the sequence of an oligomeric compound need not be 100% complementary to that of its target nucleic acid to be specifically hybridizable. Moreover, an oligonucleotide may hybridize over one or more segments such that intervening or adjacent segments are not involved in the hybridization event (e.g., a loop structure, mismatch or hairpin structure). The oligomeric compounds of the present invention comprise at least about 70%, or at least about 75%, or at leasl about 80%, or at least about 85%, or at least about 90%, or at least about 95%, or at least about 99% sequence complementarity to a target region within the target nucleic acid sequence to which they are targeted. For example, an antisensc compound in which 18 of 20 nucleotides of the antisense compound are complementary to a target region, and would therefore specifically hybridize, would represent 90 percent complementarity. In this example, the remaining noncomplementary nucleotides may be clustered or interspersed with complementary nucleotides and need not be contiguous to each other or to complementary nucleotides. As such, an antisense compound which is 18 nucleotides in length having 4 (four) noncompiemcntary nucleotides which are flanked by two regions of complete complementarity with the target nucleic acid would have 77.8% overall complementarity with the target nucleic acid and would thus fall within the scope of the present invention. Percent complementarity of an antisense compound with a region of a target nucleic acid can be determined routinely using BLAST programs (basic local alignment search tools) and PowerBLAST programs known in the art. Percent homology, sequence identity or complementarity, can be determined by, for example, the Gap program (Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, Version 8 for Unix. Genetics Computer Group, University Research Park, Madison Wis.), using default settings, which uses the algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Adv. Appl. Math., (1981) 2, 482-489). As used herein, the term “Thermal Melting Point (Tm)” refers to the temperature, under defined ionic strength, pH and nucleic acid concentration, at which 50% of the oligonucleotides complementary to the target sequence hybridize to the target sequence at equilibrium. Typically, stringent conditions will be those in which the salt concentration is at least about 0.01 to 1.0 M Na ion concentration (or other salts) at pH 7.0 to 8.3 and the temperature is at least about 30° C. for short oligonucleotides (e.g., 10 to 50 nucleotide). Stringent conditions may also be achieved with the addition of destabilizing agents such as formamide. As used herein, “modulation” means either an increase (stimulation) or a decrease (inhibition) in the expression of a gene. The term “variant”, when used in the context of a polynucleotide sequence, may encompass a polynucleotide sequence related to a wild type gene. This definition may also include, for example, “allelic,” “splice,” “species,” or “polymorphic” variants. A splice variant may have significant identity to a reference molecule, but will generally have a greater or lesser number of polynucleotides due to alternate splicing of exons during mRNA processing. The corresponding polypeptide may possess additional functional domains or an absence of domains. Species variants are polynucleotide sequences that vary from one species to another. Of particular utility in the invention are variants of wild type gene products. Variants may result from at least one mutation in the nucleic acid sequence and may result in altered mRNAs or in polypeptides whose structure or function may or may not be altered. Any given natural or recombinant gene may have none, one, or many allelic forms. Common mutational changes that give rise to variants are generally ascribed to natural deletions, additions, or substitutions of nucleotides. Each of these types of changes may occur alone, or in combination with the others, one or more times in a given sequence. The resulting polypeptides generally will have significant amino acid identity relative to each other. A polymorphic variant is a variation in the polynucleotide sequence of a particular gene between individuals of a given species. Polymorphic variants also may encompass “single nucleotide polymorphisms” (SNPs,) or single base mutations in which the polynucleotide sequence varies by one base. The presence of SNPs may be indicative of, for example, a certain population with a propensity for a disease state, that is susceptibility versus resistance. Derivative polynucleotides include nucleic acids subjected to chemical modification, for example, replacement of hydrogen by an alkyl, acyl, or amino group. Derivatives, e.g., derivative oligonucleotides, may comprise non-naturally-occurring portions, such as altered sugar moieties or inter-sugar linkages. Exemplary among these are phosphorothioate and other sulfur containing species which are known in the art. Derivative nucleic acids may also contain labels, including radionucleotides, enzymes, fluorescent agents, chemiluminscent agents, chromogenie agents, substrates, cofactors, inhibitors, magnetic particles, and the like. A “derivative” polypeptide or peptide is one that is modified, for example, by glycosylation, pegylation, phosphorylation, sulfation, reduction/alkylation, acylation, chemical coupling, or mild formalin treatment. A derivative may also be modified to contain a detectable label, either directly or indirectly, including, but not limited to, a radioisotope, fluorescent, and enzyme label. As used herein, the term “animal” or “patient” is meant to include, for example, humans, sheep, elks, deer, mule deer, minks, mammals, monkeys, horses, cattle, pigs, goats, dogs, eats, rats, mice, birds, chicken, reptiles, fish, insects and arachnids. “Mammal” covers warm blooded mammals that are typically under medical care (e.g., humans and domesticated animals). Examples include feline, canine, equine, bovine, and human, as well as just human. “Treating” or “treatment” covers the treatment of a disease-state in a mammal, and includes: (a) preventing the disease-state from occurring in a mammal, in particular, when such mammal is predisposed to the disease-state but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; (b) inhibiting the disease-state, e.g., arresting it development; and/or (c) relieving the disease-state, e.g., causing regression of the disease state until a desired endpoint is reached. Treating also includes the amelioration of a symptom of a disease (e.g., lessen the pain or discomfort), wherein such amelioration may or may not be directly affecting the disease (e.g., cause, transmission, expression, etc.). As used herein, “cancer” refers to all types of cancer or neoplasm or malignant tumors found in mammals, including, but not limited to: leukemias, lymphomas, melanomas, carcinomas and sarcomas. The cancer manifests itself as a “tumor” or tissue comprising malignant cells of the cancer. Examples of tumors include sarcomas and carcinomas such as, but not limited to: fibrosarcoma, myxosarcoma, liposarcoma, chondrosarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, chordoma, angiosarcoma, endotheliosarcoma, lymphangiosarcoma, lymphangioendotheliosarcoma, synovioma, mesothelioma, Ewing's tumor, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, colon carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, sweat gland carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcinoma, papillary carcinoma, papillary adenocarcinomas, cystadenocarcinoma, medullary carcinoma, bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatoma, bile duct carcinoma, choriocarcinoma, seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, Wilms' tumor, cervical cancer, testicular rumor, lung carcinoma, small cell lung carcinoma, bladder carcinoma, epithelial carcinoma, glioma, astrocytoma, medullobiastoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, pinenloma, hemangioblastoma, acoustic neuroma, oligodendroglioma, meningioma, melanoma, neuroblastoma, and retinoblastoma.

Polynucleotide and Oligonucleotide Compositions and Molecules Targets: In one embodiment, the targets comprise nucleic acid sequences of Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2), including without limitation sense and/or antisense noncoding and/or coding sequences associated with UCP2. Humans have a UCP1 gene, but it is active only in their brown fat, which disappears shortly after birth. UCP2 is a second, related uncoupling protein that is much more widely expressed in large adult mammals. Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2) is located on chromosome 11q13, whose homologous region on the mouse is tightly linked to the “tubby” (nutation, which causes maturity-onset obesity, insulin resistance, retinal degeneration, and neurosensory hearing loss. In addition, it was reported that their chromosomal mapping is co-incident with quantitative trait loci for obesity from at least three independent mouse models, one congenie strain, and human insulin dependent diabetes locus-4. UCP2 is expressed in a wide range of tissues ranging from the brain to muscle and fat cells. Consistent with a role in the regulation of energy utilization generally, and in diabetes and obesity in particular, the UCP2 gene is unregulated in response to fat feeding and maps to regions of the human and mouse genomes linked to hyperinsolinaemia and obesity. The UCP3 gene has also been characterized and found to be preferentially expressed in skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissues. In an embodiment, antisense oligonucleotides are used to prevent or treat diseases or disorders associated with UCP2 family members. Exemplary Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2) mediated diseases and disorders which can be treated with cell/tissues regenerated from stem cells obtained using the antisense compounds comprise: a disease or disorder associated with abnormal function and/or expression of UCP2, cancer, apoptosis, a body weight disease or disorder (e.g., obesity, an underweight disorder, etc.), cachexia, abnormal level of food intake, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, diabetes (e.g., type 2 diabetes; non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), hyperinsulinemia, a disease or disorder associated with glucose homeostasis, glucose intolerance, type II diabetes, obesity, syndrome X, immunological dysfunction, body temperature dysfunction, a cardiovascular disease or disorder, atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease, inflammation, a renal disease or disorder, a diseases associated with thermogenisis, apoptosis, cachexia, an immunological disease or disorder, a neurodegenerative disease or disorder, oxidative stress, a disease or disorder associated with impaired mitochondrial function, cerebral stroke, a disease or disorder associated with aging, aging, senescence, a disease or disorder associated with defect in fat metabolism, body mass and thermoregulation. In an embodiment, modulation of UCP2 by one or more antisense oligonucleotides is administered to a patient in need thereof, for athletic enhancement and body building. In an embodiment, modulation of UCP2 by one or more antisense oligonucleotides is administered to a patient in need thereof, to prevent or treat any disease or disorder related to UCP2 abnormal expression, function, activity as compared to a normal control. In an embodiment, the oligonucleotides are specific for polynucleotides of UCP2, which includes, without limitation noncoding regions. The UCP2 targets comprise variants of UCP2; mutants of UCP2, including SNPs; noncoding sequences of UCP2; alles, fragments and the like. Preferably the oligonucleotide is an antisense RNA molecule. In accordance with embodiments of the invention, the target nucleic acid molecule is not limited to UCP2 polynucleotides alone but extends to any of the isoforms, receptors, homologs, non-coding regions and the like of UCP2. In an embodiment, an oligonucleotide targets a natural antisense sequence (natural antisense to the coding and non-coding regions) of UCP2 targets, including, without limitation, variants, alleles, homologs, mutants, derivatives, fragments and complementary sequences thereto. Preferably the oligonucleotide is an antisense RNA or DNA molecule. In an embodiment, the oligomeric compounds of the present invention also include variants in which a different base is present at one or more of the nucleotide positions in the compound. For example, if the first nucleotide is an adenine, variants may be produced which contain thymidine, guanosine, cytidine or other natural or unnatural nucleotides at this position. This may be done at any of the positions of the antisense compound. These compounds are then tested using the methods described herein to determine their abiliry to inhibit expression of a target nucleic acid. In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, between the antisense compound and target is from about 50% to about 60%. In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, is from about 60% to about 70%. In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, is from about 70% to about 80%. In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, is from about 80% to about 90%. In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, is about 90%, about 92%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99%or about 100%. An antisense compound is specifically hybridizable when binding of the compound to the target nucleic acid interferes with the normal function of the target nucleic acid to cause a loss of activity, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the antisensc compound to non-target nucleic acid sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired. Such conditions include, i.e., physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, and conditions in which assays are performed in the ease of in vitro assays, An antisense compound, whether DNA, RNA, chimeric, substituted etc. is specifically hybridizable when binding of the compound to the target DNA or RNA molecule interferes with the normal function of the target DNA or RNA to cause a loss of utility, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the anttsense compound to non-target sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the ease of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, and in the case of in vitro assays, under conditions in which the assays are performed. In an embodiment, targeting of UCP2 including without limitation, antisense sequences which are identified and expanded, using for example, PCR, hybridization etc., one or more of the sequences set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 2 and 3, and the like, modulate the expression or function of UCP2. In one embodiment, expression or function is up-regulated as compared to a control. In an embodiment, expression or function is down-regulated as compared to a control. In an embodiment, oligonucleotides comprise nucleic acid sequences set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 4 to 14 including antisense sequences which ate identified and expanded, using for example, PCR, hybridization etc. These oligonucleotides can comprise one or more modified nucleotides, shorter or longer fragments, modified bonds and the like. Examples of modified bonds or internucleotidc linkages comprise phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate or the like. In an embodiment, the nucleotides comprise a phosphorus derivative. The phosphorus derivative (or modified phosphate group) which may be attached to the sugar or sugar analog moiety in the modified oligonucleotides of the present invention may be a monophosphate, diphosphate, triphosphate, alkylphosphate, alkanephosphate, phosphorothioate and the like. The preparation of the above-noted phosphate analogs, and their incorporation into nucleotides, modified nucleotides and oligonucleotides, per se, is also known and need not be described here. The specificity and sensitivity of antisense is also harnessed by those of skill in the art for therapeutic uses. Antisense oligonucleotides have been employed as therapeutic moieties in the treatment of disease states in animals and man. Antisense oligonucleotides have been safely and effectively administered to humans and numerous clinical trials are presently underway. It is thus established that oligonucleotides can be useful therapeutic modalities that can be configured to be useful in treatment regimes for treatment of cells, tissues and animals, especially humans. In embodiments of the present invention oligomeric antisense compounds, particularly oligonucleotides, bind to target nucleic acid molecules and modulate the expression and/or function of molecules encoded by a target gene. The functions of DNA to be interfered comprise, for example, replication and transcription. The functions of RNA to be interfered comprise all vital functions such as, for example, translocation of the RNA to the site of protein translation, translation of protein from the RNA, splicing of the RNA to yield one or more mRNA species, and catalytic activity which may be engaged in or facilitated by the RNA. The functions may be up-regulated or inhibited depending on the functions desired. The antisense compounds, include, antisense oligomceic compounds, antisense oligonucleotides, external guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides, alternate splicers, primers, probes, and other oligomeric compounds that hybridize to at least a portion of the target nucleic acid. As such, these compounds may be introduced in the form of single-stranded, double-stranded, partially single-stranded, or circular oligomeric compounds. Targeting an antisense compound to a particular nucleic acid molecule, in the context of this invention, can be a multistep process. The process usually begins with the identification of a target nucleic acid whose function is to be modulated. This target nucleic acid may be, for example, a cellular gene (or mRNA transcribed from the gene) whose expression is associated with a particular disorder or disease state, or a nucleic acid molecule from an infectious agent. In the present invention, the target nucleic acid encodes Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2). The targeting process usually also includes determination of at least one targes region, segment, or site within the target nucleic acid for the antisense interaction to occur such that the desired effect, e.g., modulation of expression, will result. Within the context of the present invention, the term “region” is defined as a portion of the target nucleic acid having at least one identifiable structure, function, or characteristic. Within regions of target nucleic acids are segments. “Segments” are defined as smaller or sub-portions of regions within a target nucleic acid. “Sites,” as used in the present invention, are defined as positions within a target nucleic acid. In an embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotides bind to the natural antisense sequences of Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2) and modulate the expression and/or function of UCP2 (SEQ ID NO: 1). Examples of antisense sequences include SEQ ID NOS: 2 to 14. In an embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotides bind to one or more segments of Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2) polynucleotides and modulate the expression and/or function of UCP2. The segments comprise at least five consecutive nucleotides of the UCP2 sense or antisense polynucleotides. In an embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotides are specific for natural antisense sequences of UCP2 wherein binding of the oligonucleotides to the natural antisense sequences of UCP2 modulate expression and/or function of UCP2. In an embodiment oligonucleotide compounds comprise sequences set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 4 to 14, anrisensc sequences which are identified and expanded, using for example, PCR, hybridization etc. These oligonucleotides can comprise one or more modified nucleotides, shorter or longer fragments, modified bonds and the like. Examples of modified bonds or imcrnucleotidc linkages comprise phosphorothioate, phosphorodithioate or the like. In an embodiment, the nucleotides comprise a phosphorus derivative. The phosphorus derivative (or modified phosphate group) which may be attached to the sugar or sugar analog moiety in the modified oligonucleotides of the present invention may be a monophosphate, diphosphate, triphosphate, alkylphosphate, alkanephosphate, phosphorothioate and the like. The preparation of the above-noted phosphate analogs, and their incorporation into nucleotides, modified nucleotides and oligonucleotides, per se, is also known and need not be described here. Since, as is known in the art, the translation initiation codon is typically 5′-AUG (in transcribed mRNA molecules; 5′-ATG in the corresponding DNA molecule), the translation initiation codon is also referred to as the “AUG codon,” the “start codon” or the “AUG start codon”. A minority of genes has a translation initiation codon having the RNA sequence 5′-GUG, 5′-UUG or 5′-CUG; and 5′-AUA, 5-ACG and 5′-CUG have been shown to function in vivo. Thus, the terms “translation initiation codon” and “start codon” can encompass many codon sequences, even though the initiator amino acid in each instance is typically methionine (in eukaryotes) or formylmethioninc (in prokaryotes). Eukaryotic and prokaryotic genes may have two or more alternative start codons, any one of which may be preferentially utilized for translation initiation in a particular cell type or tissue, or under a particular set of conditions, in the contest of the invention, “start codon” and “translation initiation codon” refer to the codon or codons that are used in vivo to initiate translation of an mRNA transcribed from a gene encoding Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2), regardless of the sequence(s) of such codons. A translation termination codon (or “stop codon”) of a gene may have one of three sequences, i.e., 5′-UAA, 5′-UAG and 5′-UGA (the corresponding DNA sequences are 5′-TAA, 5′- TAG and 5′-TGA, respectively). The terms “start codon region” and “translation initiation codon region” refer to a portion of such an mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous nucleotides in either direction (i.e., 5′ or 3′) from a translation initiation codon. Similarly, the terms “stop codon region” and “translation termination codon region” refer to a portion of such an mRNA or gene that encompasses from about 25 to about 50 contiguous nucleotides in either direction (i.e., 5′ or 3′) from a translation termination codon. Consequently, the “start codon region” (or “translation initiation codon region”) and the “step codon region” (or “translation termination codon region”) are all regions that may be targeted effectively with the antisense compounds of the present invention. The open reading frame (ORF) or “coding region,” which is known in the art to refer to the region between the translation initiation codon and the translation termination codon, is also a region which may be targeted effectively. Within the context of the present invention, a targeted region is the intragenic region encompassing the translation initiation or termination codon of the open reading frame (ORF) of a gene. Another target region includes the 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 5′ direction from the translation initiation codon, and thus including nucleotides between the 5′ cap site and the translation initiation codon of an mRNA (or corresponding nucleotides on the gene). Still another target region includes the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR), known in the art to refer to the portion of an mRNA in the 3′ direction from the translation termination codon, and thus including nucleotides between the translation termination codon and 3′ end of an mRNA (or corresponding nucleotides on the gene). The 5′ cap site of an mRNA comprises an N7-methylated guanosine residue joined to the 5′-most residue of the mRNA via a 5′-5′ triphosphate linkage. The 5′ cap region of an mRNA is considered to include the 5′ cap structure itself as well as the first 50 nucleotides adjacent to the cap site. Another target region for this invention is the 5′ cap region. Although some eukaryotic mRNA transcripts are directly translated, many contain one or more regions, known as “introns,” which are excised from a transcript before it is translated. The remaining (and therefore translated) regions are known as “exons” and are spliced together to form a continuous mRNA sequence. In one embodiment, targeting splice sites, i.e., intron-exon junctions or exon-intron junctions, is particularly useful in situations where aberrant splicing is implicated in disease, or where an overproduction of a particular splice product is implicated in disease. An aberrant fusion junction due to rearrangement or deletion is another embodiment of a target site. mRNA transcripts produced via the process of splicing of two (or more) mRNAs from different gene sources are known as “fusion transcripts”. Introns can be effectively targeted using antisense compounds targeted to, for example, DNA or pre-mRNA. In an embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotides bind to coding and/or non-coding regions of a target polynucleotide and modulate the expression and/or function of the target molecule. In an embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotides bind to natural antisense polynucleotides and modulate the expression and/or function of the target molecule. In an embodiment, the antisense oligonucleotides bind to sense polynucleotides and modulate the expression and/or function of the target molecule. Alternative RNA transcripts can be produced from the same genomic region of DNA. These alternative transcripts are generally known as “variants”. More specifically, “pre-mRNA variants” are transcripts produced from the same genomic DNA that differ from other transcripts produced from the same genomic DNA in either their start or stop position and contain both intronic and exonic sequence. Upon excision of one or more exon or intron regions, or portions thereof during splicing, pre-mRNA variants produce smaller “mRNA variants”. Consequently, mRNA variants are processed pre-mRNA variants and each unique pre-mRNA variant must always produce a unique mRNA variant as a result of splicing. These mRNA variants are also known as “alternative splice variants”. If no splicing of the pre-mRNA variant occurs then the pre-mRNA variant is identical to the mRNA variant. Variants can be produced through the use of alternative signals to start or stop transcription. Pre-mRNAs and mRNAs can possess more than one start codon or stop codon. Variants that originate from a pre-mRNA or mRNA that use alternative start codons are known as “alternative start variants” of that pre-mRNA or mRNA. Those transcripts that use an alternative stop codon are known as “alternative stop variants” of that pre-mRNA or mRNA. One specific type of alternative stop variant is the “polyA variant” in which the multiple transcripts produced result from the alternative selection of one of the “poly A stop signals” by the transcription machinery, thereby producing transcripts that terminate at unique polyA sites. Within the context of the invention, the types of variants described herein are also embodiments of target nucleic acids. The locations on the target nucleic acid to which the antisense compounds hybridize are defined as at least a 5-nuclectide long portion of a target region to which an active antisense compound is targeted. While the specific sequences of certain exemplary target segments are set forth herein, one of skill in the art will recognize that these serve to illustrate and describe particular embodiments within the scope of the present invention. Additional target segments are readily identifiable by one having ordinary skill in the art in view of this disclosure. Target segments 5-100 nucleotides in length comprising a stretch of at least five (5) consecutive nucleotides selected from within the illustrative preferred target segments are considered to be suitable for targeting as well. Target segments can include DNA or RNA sequences that comprise at least the 5 consecutive nucleotides from the 5′-terminus of one of the illustrative preferred target segments (the remaining nucleotides being a consecutive stretch of the same DNA or RNA beginning immediately upstream of the 5-terminus of the target segment and continuing until the DNA or RNA contains about 5 to about 100 nucleotides). Similarly preferred target segments are represented by DNA or RNA sequences that comprise at least the 5 consecutive nucleotides from the 3′-terminus of one of the illustrative preferred target segments (the remaining nucleotides being a consecutive stretch of the same DNA or RNA beginning immediately downstream of the 3′-terminus of the target segment and continuing until the DNA or RNA contains about 5 to about 100 nucleotides). One having skill in the art armed with the target segments illustrated herein will be able, without undue experimentation, to identify further preferred target segments. Once one or more target regions, segments or sites have been identified, antisense compounds are chosen which are sufficiently complementary to the target, i.e., hybridize sufficiently well and with sufficient specificity, to give the desired effect. In embodiments of the invention the oligonucleotides bind to an antisensc strand of a particular target. The oligonucleotides are at least 5 nucleotides in length and can be synthesized so each oligonucleotide targets overlapping sequences such that oligonucleotides are synthesized to cover the entire length of the target polynucleotide. The targets also include coding as well as non coding regions. In one embodiment, it is preferred to target specific nucleic acids by aniisense oligonucleotides. Targeting an antisense compound to a particular nucleic acid, is a multistep process. The process usually begins with the identification of a nucleic acid sequence whose function is to be modulated. This may be, for example, a cellular gene (or mRNA transcribed from the gene) whose expression is associated with a particular disorder or disease state, or a non coding polynucleotide such as for example, non coding RNA (ncRNA). RNAs can be classified into (1) messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which are translated into proteins, and (2) non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). ncRNAs comprise microRNAs, antisense transcripts and other Transcriptional Units (TU) containing a high density of stop codons and lacking any extensive “Open Reading Frame”. Many ncRNAs appear to start from initiation sites in 3′ untranslated regions (3′UTRs) of protein-coding loci. ncRNAs are often rare and at least half of the ncRNAs that have been sequenced by the FANTOM consortium seem not to be polyadenylated. Most researchers have for obvious reasons focused on polyadenylated mRNAs that are processed and exported to the cytoplasm. Recently, it was shown that the set of non-polyadenylated nuclear RNAs may be very large, and that many such transcripts arise from so-called intergenic regions. The mechanism by which ncRNAs may regulate gene expression, is by base pairing with target transcripts. The RNAs that function by base pairing can be grouped into (1) cis encoded RNAs that are encoded at the same genetic location, but on the opposite strand to the RNAs they act upon and therefore display perfect complementarity to their target, and (2) trans-encoded RNAs that are encoded at a chromosomal location distinct from the RNAs they act upon and generally do not exhibit perfect base-pairing potential with their targets. Without wishing to be bound by theory, perturbation of an antisense polynucleotide by the antisense oligonucleotides described herein can alter the expression of the corresponding sense messenger RNAs. However, this regulation can either be discordant (antisense knockdown results in messenger RNA elevation) or concordant (antisense knockdown results in concomitant messenger RNA reduction). In these cases, antisense oligonucleotides can be targeted to overlapping or non-overlapping parts of the antisense transcript resulting in its knockdown or sequestration. Coding as well as non-coding antisense can be targeted in an identical manner and that either category is capable of regulating the corresponding sense transcripts—either in a concordant or disconcordant manner. The strategics that are employed in identifying new oligonucleotides for use against a target can be based on the knockdown of antisense RNA transcripts by anttisense oligonucleotides or any other means of modulating the desired target. Strategy 1: In the case of discordant regulation, knocking down the antisense transcript elevates the expression of the conventional (sense) gene. Should that latter gene encode for a known or putative drug target, then knockdown of its antisense counterpart could conceivably mimic the action of a receptor agonist or an enzyme stimulant. Strategy 2: In the case of concordant regulation, one could concomitantly knock down both antisense and sense transcripts and thereby achieve synergistic reduction of the conventional (sense) gene expression. If, for example, an antisense oligonucleotide is used to achieve knockdown, then this strategy can be used to apply one antisense oligonucleotide targeted to the sense transcript and another antisense oligonucleotide to the corresponding antisense transcript, or a single energetically symmetric antisense oligonucleotide that simultaneously targets overlapping sense and antisense transcripts. According to the present invention, antisense compounds include antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, external guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides, siRNA compounds, single- or double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi) compounds such as siRNA compounds, and other oligomeric compounds which hybridize to at least a portion of the target nucleic acid and modulate its function. As such, they may be DNA, RNA, DNA-like, RNA-like, or mixtures thereof, or may be mimctics of one or more of these. These compounds may be single-stranded, doublestranded, circular or hairpin oligomeric compounds and may contain structural elements such as internal or terminal bulges, mismatches or loops. Antisense compounds are routinely prepared linearly but can be joined or otherwise prepared to be circular and/or branched. Antisense compounds can include constructs such as, for example, two strands hybridized to form a wholly or partially double-stranded compound or a single strand with sufficient self-complementarity to allow for hybridization and formation of a fully or partially double-stranded compound. The two strands can be linked internally leaving free 3′ or 5′ termini or can be linked to form a continuous hairpin structure or loop. The hairpin structure may contain an overhang on either the 5′ or 3′ terminus producing an extension of single stranded character. The double stranded compounds optionally can include overhangs on the ends. Further modifications can include conjugate groups attached to one of the termini, selected nucleotide positions, sugar positions or to one of the intcmucicostdc linkages. Alternatively, the two strands can be linked via a non-nucleic acid moiety or linker group. When formed from only one strand, dsRNA can take the form of a self-complementary hairpin-type molecule that doubles back on itself to form a duplex. Thus, the dsRNAs can be fully or partially double stranded. Specific modulation of gene expression can be achieved by stable expression of dsRNA hairpins in transgenic cell lines, however, in some embodiments, the gene expression or function is up regulated. When formed from two strands, or a single strand that takes the form of a self-complementary hairpin-type molecule doubled back on itself to form a duplex, the two strands (or duplex-forming regions of a single strand) are complementary RNA strands that base pair in Watson-Crick fashion. Once introduced to a system, the compounds of the invention may elicit the action of one or more enzymes or structural proteins to effect cleavage or other modification of the target nucleic acid or may work via occupancy-based mechanisms. In general, nucleic acids (including oligonucleotides) may be described as “DNA-like” (i.e., generally having one or more 2′-deoxy sugars and, generally, T rather than U bases) or “RNA-like” (i.e., generally having one or more 2′-hydroxyl or 2′-modified sugars and, generally U rather than T bases). Nucleic acid helices can adopt more than one type of structure, most commonly the A- and B-forms. It is believed that, in general, oligonucleotides which have B-form-like structure are “DNA-like” and those which have A-formlike structure are “RNA-like.” In some (chimeric) embodiments, an antisense compound may contain both A- and B-form regions. In an embodiment, the desired oligonucleotides or antisense compounds, comprise at least one of: antisense RNA, antisense DNA, chimeric antisense oligonucleotides, antisense oligonucleotides comprising modified linkages, interference RNA (RNAi), short interfering RNA (siRNA); a micro, interfering RNA (miRNA); a small, temporal RNA (stRNA): or a short, hairpin RNA (shRNA); small RNA-induccd gene activation (RNAa); small activating RNAs (saRNAs), or combinations thereof. dsRNA can also activate gene expression, a mechanism that has been termed “small RNA-induccd gene activation” or RNAa, dsRNAs targeting gene promoters induce potent transcriptional activation of associated genes, RNAa was demonstrated in human cells using synthetic dsRNAs, termed “small activating RNAs” (saRNAs). It is currently not known whether RNAa is conserved in other organisms. Small double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) and microRNA (miRNA), have been found to be the trigger of an evolutionary conserved mechanism known as RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi invariably leads to gene silencing via remodeling chromatin to thereby suppress transcription, degrading complementary mRNA, or blocking protein translation. However, in instances described in detail in the examples section which follows, oligonucleotides are shown to increase the expression and/or function of the Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2) polynucleotides and encoded products thereof dsRNAs may also act as small activating RNAs (saRNA). Without wishing to be bound by theory, by targeting sequences in gene promoters, saRNAs would induce target gene expression in a phenomenon referred to as dsRNA-induced transcriptional activation (RNAa). In a further embodiment, the “preferred target segments” identified herein may be employed in a screen for additional compounds that modulate the expression of Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2) polynucleotides. “Modulators” are those compounds that decrease or increase the expression of a nucleic acid molecule encoding UCP2 and which comprise at least a 5-nucleotide portion that is complementary to a preferred target segment. The screening method composes the steps of contacting a preferred target segment of a nucleic acid molecule encoding sense or natural antisense polynucleotides of UCP2 with one or more candidate modulators, and selecting for one or more candidate modulators which decrease or increase the expression of a nucleic acid molecule, encoding UCP2 polynucleotides, e.g. SEQ ID NOS: 4 to 14. Once it is shown that the candidate modulator or modulators are capable of modulating (e.g. either decreasing or increasing) the expression of a nucleic acid molecule encoding UCP2 polynucleotides, the modulator may then be employed in further investigative studies of the function of UCP2 polynucleotides, or for use as a research, diagnostic, or therapeutic agent in accordance with the present invention. Targeting the natural antisense sequence preferably modulates the function of the target gene. For example, the UCP2 gene (e.g. accession number NM—003355). In an embodiment, the target is an antisense polynucleotide of the UCP2 gene. In an embodiment, an antisense oligonucleotide targets sense and/or natural antisense sequences of UCP2 polynucleotides (e.g. accession number NM—003355), variants, alleles, isoforms, homologs, mutants, derivatives, fragments and complementary sequences thereto. Preferably the oligonucleotide is an antisense molecule and the targets include coding and nencoding regions of antisense and/or sense UCP2 polynucleotides. The preferred target segments of the present invention may be also be combined with their respective complementary antisense compounds of the present invention to form stabilized double-stranded (duplexed) oligonucleotides. Such double stranded oligonucleotide moieties have been shown in the art to modulate target expression and regulate translation as well as RNA processing via an antisense mechanism. Moreover, the double-stranded moieties may be subject to chemical modifications. For example, such double-stranded moieties have been shown to inhibit the target by the classical hybridization of antisense strand of the duplex to the target, thereby triggering enzymatic degradation of the target. In an embodiment, an antisense oligonucleotide targets Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2) polynucleotides (e.g. accession number NM—003355), variants, alleles, isoforms, homologs, mutants, derivatives, fragments and complementary sequences thereto. Preferably the oligonucleotide is an antisense molecule. In accordance with embodiments of the invention, the target nucleic acid molecule is not limited to UCP2 alone but extends to any of the isoforms, receptors, homologs and the like of UCP2 molecules. In an embodiment, an oligonucleotide targets a natural antisense sequence of UCP2 polynucleotides, for example, polynucleotides set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 2 and 3, and any variants, alleles, homologs, mutants, derivatives, fragments and complementary sequences thereto. Examples of antisense oligonucleotides are set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 4 to 14. In one embodiment, the oligonucleotides are complementary to or bind to nucleic acid sequences of UCP2 antisense, including without limitation noncoding sense and/or antisense sequences associated with UCP2 polynucleotides and modulate expression and/or function of UCP2 molecules. In an embodiment, the oligonucleotides are complementary to or bind to nucleic acid sequences of UCP2 natural antisense, set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 2 and 3 and modulate expression and/or function of UCP2 molecules. In an embodiment, oligonucleotides comprise sequences of at least 5 consecutive nucleotides of SEQ ID NOS: 4 to 14 and modulate expression and/or function of UCP2 molecules. The polynucleotide targets comprise UCP2, including family members thereof, variants of UCP2; mutants of UCP2, including SNPs: noncoding sequences of UCP2; alleles of UCP2; species variants, fragments and the like. Preferably the oligonucleotide is an antisense molecule. In an embodiment, the oligonucleotide targeting UCP2 polynucleotides, comprise: antisense RNA, interference RNA (RNAi), short interfering RNA (siRNA); micro interfering RNA (miRNA); a small, temporal RNA (stRNA); or a short, hairpin RNA (shRNA); small RNA-induccd gene activation (RNAa); or, small activating RNA (saRNA). In an embodiment, targeting of Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2) polynucleotides, e.g. SEQ ID NOS: 2 and 3 modulate the expression or function of these targets. In one embodiment, expression or function is up-regulated as compared to a control. In an embodiment, expression or function is down-regulated as compared to a control. In an embodiment, antisense compounds comprise sequences set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 4 to 14. These oligonucleotides can comprise one or more modified nucleotides, shorter or longer fragments, modified bonds and the like. In an embodiment, SEQ ID NOS: 4 to 14 comprise one or more LNA nucleotides. The modulation of a desired target nucleic acid can be carried out in several vwjys known in the art. For example, antisense oligonucleotides, siRNA etc. Enzymatic nucleic acid molecules (e.g., ribozymes) are nucleic acid molecules capable of catalyzing one or more of a variety of reactions, including the ability to repeatedly cleave other separate nucleic acid molecules in a nucleotide base sequence-specific manner. Such enzymatic nucleic acid molecules can be used, for example, to target virtually any RNA transcript. Because of their sequence-specificity, trans-cleaving enzymatic nucleic acid molecules show promise as therapeutic agents for human disease (Usman & McSwiggen, (1995) Ann. Rep Med. Chem. 30, 285-294; Christoffersen and Marr, (1995) J. Med. Chem. 38, 2023-2037). Enzymatic nucleic acid molecules can be designed to cleave specific RNA targets within the background of cellular RNA. Such a cleavage event renders the mRNA non-functional and abrogates protein expression from that RNA. In this manner, synthesis of a protein associated with a disease state can be selectively inhibited. In general, enzymatic nucleic acids with RNA cleaving activity act by first binding to a target RNA. Such binding occurs through the target binding portion of an enzymatic nucleic acid which is held in close proximity to an enzymatic portion of the molecule that acts to cleave the target RNA. Thus, the enzymatic nucleic acid first recognizes and then binds a target RNA through complementary base pairing, and once bound to the correct site, acts enzymatically to cut the target RNA. Strategic cleavage of such a target RNA will destroy its ability to direct synthesis of an encoded protein. After an enzymatic nucleic acid has bound and cleaved its RNA target, it is released from that RNA to search for another target and can repeatedly bind and cleave new targets. Several approaches such as in vitro selection (evolution) strategies (Orgel, (1979) Proc. R. Soc. London, B 205, 435) have been used to evolve new nucleic acid catalysts capable of catalyzing a variety of reactions, such as cleavage and ligation of phosphodiestcr linkages and amide linkages. The development of ribozymes that are optimal for catalytic activity would contribute significantly to any strategy that employs RNA-ctcaving ribozymes for the purpose of regulating gene expression. The hammerhead ribozyme, for example, functions with a catalytic rate (kcat) of about 1 min-l in the presence of saturating (10 mM) concentrations of Mg2+ cofactor. An artificial “RNA ligase” ribozyme has been shown to catalyze the corresponding self-modification reaction with a rate of about 100 min-l. In addition, it is known that certain modified hammerhead ribozymes that have substrate binding arms made of DNA catalyze RNA cleavage with multiple turn-over rates that approach 100 min-l. Finally, replacement of a specific residue within the catalytic core of the hammerhead with certain nucleotide analogues gives modified ribozymes that show as much as a 10-fold improvement in catalytic rate. These findings demonstrate that ribozymes can promote chemical transformations with catalytic rates that are significantly greater than those displayed in vitro by most natural self-cleaving ribozymes. It is then possible that the structures of certain selfcleaving ribozymes may be optimized to give maximal catalytic activity, or that entirely new RNA motifs can be made that display significantly faster rates for RNA phosphodiester cleavage. Intermolecular cleavage of an RNA substrate by an RNA catalyst that fits the “hammerhead” model was first shown in 1987 (Uhlenbeck, O. C. (1987) Nature, 328: 596-600). The RNA catalyst was recovered and reacted with multiple RNA molecules, demonstrating that it was truly catalytic. Catalytic RNAs designed based on the “hammerhead” motif have been used to cleave specific target sequences by making appropriate base changes in the catalytic RNA to maintain necessary base pairing with the target sequences. This has allowed use of the catalytic RNA to cleave specific target sequences and indicates that catalytic RNAs designed according to the “hammerhead” model may possibly cleave specific substrate RNAs in vivo. RNA interference (RNAi) has become a powerful tool for modulating gene expression in mammals and mammalian cells. This approach requires the delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) either as RNA itself or as DNA, using an expression plasmid or vims and the coding sequence for small hairpin RNAs that are processed to siRNAs. This system enables efficient transport of the pre-siRNAs to the cytoplasm where they are active and permit the use of regulated and tissue specific promoters for gene expression. In an embodiment, an oligonucleotide or antisense compound comprises an oligomer or polymer of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and/or deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), or a mimetic, chimera, analog or homolog thereof. This term includes oligonucleotides composed of naturally occurring nucleotides, sugars and covalent internucleoside (backbone) linkages as well as oligonucleotides having non-naturaily occurring portions which function similarly. Such modified or substituted oligonucleotides are often desired over native forms because of desirable properties such as, for example, enhanced cellular uptake, enhanced affinity for a target nucleic acid and increased stability in the presence of nucleases. According to the present invention, the oligonucleotides or “antisense compounds” include antisense oligonucleotides (e.g. RNA, DNA, mimetic, chimera, analog or homolog thereof), ribozymes, external guide sequence (EGS) oligonucleotides, siRNA compounds, single- or double-stranded RNA interference (RNAi) compounds such as siRNA compounds, saRNA, aRNA, and other oligomeric compounds which hybridize to at least a portion of the target nucleic acid and modulate its function. As such, they may be DNA, RNA, DNA-like, RNA-like, or mixtures thereof, or may be mimetics of one or more of these. These compounds may be single-stranded, double-stranded, circular or hairpin oligomeric compounds and may contain structural elements such as internal or terminal bulges, mismatches or loops. Antisense compounds are routinely prepared linearly but can be joined or otherwise prepared to be circular and/or branched. Antisense compounds can include constructs such as, for example, two strands hybridized to form a wholly or partially double-stranded compound or a single strand with sufficient self-complementarity to allow for hybridization and formation of a fully or partially double-stranded compound. The two strands can be linked internally leaving free 3′ or 5′ termini or can be linked to form a continuous hairpin structure or loop. The hairpin structure may contain an overhang on cither the 5′ or 3′ terminus producing an extension of single stranded character. The double stranded compounds optionally can include overhangs on the ends. Further modifications can include conjugate groups attached to one of the termini, selected nucleotide positions, sugar positions or to one of the internucleoside linkages. Alternatively, the two strands can be linked via a non-nucleic acid moiety or linker group. When formed from only one strand, dsRNA can take the form of a self-complementary hairpin-type molecule that doubles back on itself to form a duplex. Thus, the dsRNAs can be fully or partially double stranded. Specific modulation of gene expression can be achieved by stable expression of dsRNA hairpins in transgenic cell lines. When formed from two strands, or a single strand that takes the form of a self-complementary hairpin-type molecule doubled back on itself to form a duplex, the two strands (or duplex-forming regions of a single strand) are complementary RNA strands that base pair in Watson-Crick fashion. Once introduced to a system, the compounds of the invention may elicit the action of one or more enzymes or structural proteins to effect cleavage or other modification of the target nucleic acid or may work via occupancy-based mechanisms. In general, nucleic acids (including oligonucleotides) may be described as “DNA-like” (i.e., generally having one or more 2′-deoxy sugars and, generally, T rather than U bases) or “RNA-like” (i.e., generally having one or more 2′-hydroxyl or 2′-modified sugars and, generally U rather than T bases). Nucleic acid helices can adopt more than one type of structure, most commonly the A- and B-forms. It is believed that, in general, oligonucleotides which have B-form-like structure are “DNA-like” and those which have A-formlike structure are “RNA-like.” In some (chimeric) embodiments, an antisense compound may contain both A- and B-form regions. The antisense compounds in accordance with this invention can comprise an antisense portion from about 5 to about 80) nucleotides (i.e. from about 5 to about 80 linked nucleosides) in length. This refers to the length of the antisense strand or portion of the antisense compound. In other words, a single-stranded antisense compound of the invention comprises from 5 to about 80 nucleotides, and a double-stranded antisense compound of the invention (such as a dsRNA, for example) comprises a sense and an antisense strand or portion of 5 to about 80 nucleotides in length. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this comprehends antisense portions of 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, or 80 nucleotides in length, or any range therewithin. In one embodiment, the antisense compounds of the invention have antisense portions of 10 to 50 nucleotides in length. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this embodies oligonucleotides having antisense portions of 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or 50 nucleotides in length, or any range therewith. In some embodiments, the oligonucleotides are 15 nucleotides in length. In one embodiment, the antisense or oligonucleotide compounds of the invention have antisense portions of 12 or 13 to 30 nucleotides in length. One having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that this embodies antisense compounds having antisense portions of 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 or 30 nucleotides in length, or any range therewithin. In an embodiment, the oligomeric compounds of the present invention also include variants in which a different base is present at one or more of the nucleotide positions in the compound. For example, if the first nucleotide is an adenosine, variants may be produced which contain thymidine, guanosine or cytidine at this position. This may be done at any of the positions of the antisense or dsRNA compounds. These compounds are then tested using the methods described herein to determine their ability to inhibit expression of a target nucleic acid. In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, between the antisense compound and target is from about 40% to about 60%. In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, is from about 60% to about 70%. In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, is from about 70% to about 80%. in some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, is from about 80% to about 90%. In some embodiments, homology, sequence identity or complementarity, is about 90%, about 92%, about 94%, about 95%, about 96%, about 97%, about 98%, about 99% or about 100%. In an embodiment, the antisensc oligonucleotides, such as for example, nucleic acid molecules set forth in SEQ ID NOS: 2 to 14 comprise one or more substitutions or modifications. In one embodiment, the nucleotides are substituted with locked nucleic acids (LNA). In an embodiment, the oligonucleotides target one or more regions of the nucleic acid molecules sense and/or antisense of coding and/or non-coding sequences associated with UCP2 and the sequences set forth as SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 3. The oligonucleotides are also targeted to overlapping regions of SEQ ID NOS: 1 to 3. Certain preferred oligonucleotides of this invention are chimeric oligonucleotides, “Chimeric oligonucleotides” or “chimeras,” in the context of this invention, are oligonucleotides which contain two or more chemically distinct regions, each made up of at least one nucleotide. These oligonucleotides typically contain at least one region of modified nucleotides that confers one or more beneficial properties (such as, for example, increased nuclease resistance, increased uptake into cells, increased binding affinity for the target) and a region that is a substrate for enzymes capable of cleaving RNA:DNA or RNA:RNA hybrids. By way of example, RNase H is a cellular endonuclease which cleaves the RNA strand of an RNA:DNA duplex. Activation of RNase H, therefore, results in cleavage of the RNA target, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of antisensc modulation of gene expression. Consequently, comparable results can often be obtained with shorter oligonucleotides when chimeric oligonucleotides are used, compared to phosphorothioate deoxyoligonucleotides hybridizing to the same target region. Cleavage of the RNA target can be routinely detected by gel electrophoresis and, if necessary, associated nucleic acid hybridization techniques known so the art. In one an embodiment, a chimeric oligonucleotide comprises at least one region modified to increase target binding affinity, and, usually, a region that acts as a substrate for RNAsc H. Affinity of an oligonucleotide for its target (in this case, a nucleic acid encoding ras) is routinely determined by measuring the Tm of an oligonucleotide/target pair, which is the temperature at which the oligonucleotide and target dissociate:dissociation is detected spectrophotometrically. The higher the Tm, the greater is the affinity of the oligonucleotide for the target. Chimeric antisense compounds of the invention may be formed as composite structures of two or more oligonucleotides, modified oligonucleotides, oligonucleotides and/or oligonucleotides mimeties as described above. Such compounds have also been referred to in the art as hybrids or gapmers. Representative United States patents that teach the preparation of such hybrid structures comprise, but are not limited to, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,013,830, 5,149,797; 5,220,007; 5,256,775; 5,366,878; 5,403,711; 5,491,133; 5,565,350; 5,623,065; 5,652,355; 5,652,356; and 5,700,922, each of which is herein incorporated by reference. In an embodiment, the region of the oligonucleotide which is modified comprises at least one nucleotide modified at the 2′ position of the sugar, most preferably a 2′-Oalkyl, 2′-O-alkyl-O-alkyl or 2′-fluoro-modified nucleotide. In other an embodiment, RNA modifications include 2′-fluoro, 2′-amino and 2′ O-methyl modifications on the ribose of pyrimidines, abasic residues or an inverted base at the 3′ end of tbe RNA. Such modifications are routinely incorporated into oligonucleotides and these oligonucleotides have been shown to have a higher Tm (i.e., higher target binding affinity) than; 2′-deoxyoligonucleotides against a given target. The effect of such increased affinity is to greatly enhance RNAs oligonucleotide inhibition of gene expression. RNAsc H is a cellular endonuclease that cleaves the RNA strand of RNA:DNA duplexes; activation of this enzyme therefore results in cleavage of the RNA target, and thus can greatly enhance the efficiency of RNAi inhibition. Cleavage of the RNA target can be routinely demonstrated by get electrophoresis. In an embodiment, the chimeric oligonucleotide is also modified to enhance nuclease resistance. Cells contain a variety of exo- and endo-nucleases which can degrade nucleic acids. A number of nucleotide and nucleoside modifications have been shown to make the oligonucleotide into which they are incorporated more resistant to nuclease digestion than the native oligodeoxynucleotide. Nuclease resistance is routinely measured by incubating oligonucleotides with cellular extracts or isolated nuclease solutions and measuring the extent of intact oligonucleotide remaining over time, usually by gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotides which have been modified to enhance their nuclease resistance survive intact for a longer time than unmodified oligonucleotides. A variety of oligonucleotide modifications have been demonstrated to enhance or confer nuclease resistance. Oligonucleotides which contain at least one phosphorothioate modification are presently more preferred. In some cases, oligonucleotide modifications which enhance target binding affinity are also, independently, able to enhance nuclease resistance. Specific examples of some preferred oligonucleotides envisioned for this invention include those comprising modified backbones, for example, phosphorothioates, phosphotriesters, methyl phosphorates, short chain alkyl or cycloalkyl intersugar linkages or short chain heteroatomic or heterocyclic intersugar linkages. Most preferred are oligonucleotides with phosphorothioate backbones and those with heteroatom backbones, particularly CH2 —NH—O—CH2, CH, —N(CH3)—O—CH2 [known as a methylene(methylimino) or MMI backbone], CH2—O—N (CH3)—CH2, CH2 —N (CH3)—N (CH3)—CH2 and O—N (CH3)—CH2—CH2 backbones, wherein the native phosphodiester backbone is represented as O—P—O—CH). The amide backbones disclosed by De Mesmacker et al. (1995) Acc. Chem. Res. 28:366-374 are also preferred. Also preferred are oligonucleotides having morpholino backbone structures (Summerton and Weller, U.S. Pat. No. 5,034,506). In other an embodiment, such as the peptide nucleic acid (PNA) backbone, the phosphodiester backbone of the oligonucleotide is replaced with a polyamide backbone, the nucleotides being bound directly or indirectly to the aza nitrogen atoms of the polyamlde backbone. Oligonucleotides may also comprise one or more substituted sugar moieties. Preferred oligonucleotides comprise one of the following at the 2′ position: OH, SH, SCH3, F, OCN, OCH3 OCH3, OCH3 O(CH2)n CH3, O(CH2)n NH2 or O(CH2)n CH3 where n is from 1 to about 10; C1 to C10 lower alkyl, alkoxyalkoxy, substituted lower atkyl, alkaryl or aralkyl; Cl; Br; CN; CF3; OCF3; O—, S—, or N-alkyl; O-, S-, or N-alkeny); SOCH3; SO2 CH2; ONO2; NO2; N3; NH2; heterocycloalkyl; heterecycloalkaryl; aminoalkylamino; polyalkylamino; substituted silyl; an RNA cleaving group; a reporter group; an interlator; a group for improving the pharmacokinetic properties of an oligonucleotide; or a group for improving the pharmacodynamic properties of an oligonucleotide and other substituents having similar properties. A preferred modification includes 2′-methoxyethoxy [2′-O-CH2 CH2 OCH3, also known as 2′-O-(2-methoxyethyl)]. Other preferred modifications include 2′-methoxy (2′-O—CH3), 2′-propoxy (2′-OCH2 CH2CH3) and 2′-fluoro (2′-F). Similar modifications may also be made at other positions on the oligonucleotide, particularly the 3′ position of the sugar on the 3′ terminal nucleotide and the 5′ position of 5′ terminal nucleotide. Oligonucleotides may also have sugar mimeties such as cyclobutyls in place of the pentofuranasyl group. Oligonucleotides may also include, additionally or alternatively, nucleobase (often referred to in the art simply as “base”) modifications or substitutions. As used herein, “unmodified” or “natural” nucleotides include adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), cytosine (C) and uracil (U). Modified nucleotides include nucleotides found only infrequently or transiently in natural nucleic acids, e.g., hypoxanthine, 6-methyladenine, 5-Me pyrimidines, particularly 5-methylcytosine (also referred to as 5-methyl-2′ deoxycytosine and often referred to in the art as 5-Me—C), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (HMC), glycosyl HMC and gensobiosyl HMC, as well as synthetic nucleotides, e.g., 2-aminoadenine, 2-(methylamino)adenine, 2-(imidazolylalkyl)adenine, 2-(aminoalklyamino)adenine or other heterosubstituted alkyladenines, 2-thiouracil, 2-thiothymine, 5-bromouracil, 5-hydroxymethyluracil, 8-azaguanine, 7-deazaguanine, N6 (6-aminohexyl)adenine and 2,6-diaminepurine. A “universal” base known in the art, e.g., inosine, may be included, 5-Me—C substitutions have been shown to increase nucleic acid duplex stability by 0.6-1.2° C. and are presently preferred base substitutions. Another modification of the oligonucleotides of the invention involves chemically linking to the oligonucleotide one or more moieties or conjugates which enhance the activity or cellular uptake of the oligonucleotide. Such moieties include but are not limited to lipid moieties such as a cholesterol moiety, a cholestcryl moiety, an aliphatic chain, e.g., dodecandiol or undecyl residues, a polyamine or a polyethylene glycol chain, or Adatrantanc acetic acid. Oligonucleotides comprising lipophilic moieties, and methods for preparing such oligonucleotides are known in the art, for example, U.S. Pat Nos. 5,138,045, 5,218,105 and 5,459,255. It is not necessary for all positions in a given oligonucleotide to be uniformly modified, and in fact more than one of the aforementioned modifications may be incorporated in a single oligonucleotide or even at within a single nucleoside within an oligonucleotide. The present invention also includes oligonucleotides which are chimeric oligonucleotides as hereinbefore defined. In another embodiment the nucleic acid molecule of the present invention is conjugated with another moiety including but not limited to abasic nucleotides, polyethcr, polyamine, polyamides, peptides, carbohydrates, lipid, or polyhydrocarbon compounds. Those skilled in the art will recognize that these molecules can be linked to one or more of any nucleotides comprising the nucleic acid molecule at several positions on the sugar, base or phosphate group, The oligonucleotides used in accordance with this invention may be conveniently and routinely made through the well-known technique of solid phase synthesis. Equipment for such synthesis is sold by several vendors including Applied Biosysietns. Any other means for such synthesis may also be employed; the actual synthesis of the oligonucleotides is well within the talents of one of ordinary skill in the art. It is also well known to use similar techniques to prepare other oligonucleotides such as the phosphorothioates and alkylated derivatives. It is also well known to use similar techniques and commercially available modified amidites and controlJcd-porc glass (CPG) products such as biotin, fluorescein, acridine or psoralen-modificd amidites and/or CPG (available from Glen Research, Sterling Va.) to synthesize fluorcsccntly labeled, biotinylated or other modified oligonucleotides such as cholesterol-modified oligonucleotides. In accordance wish the invention, use of modifications such as the use of LNA monomers to enhance the potency, specificity and duration of action and broaden the routes of administration of oligonucleotides comprised of current chemistries such as MOE, ANA, FANA, PS etc. This can be achieved by substituting some of the monomers in the current oligonucleotides by LNA monomers. The LNA modified oligonucleotide may have a size similar to the parent compound or may be larger or preferably smaller. It is preferred that such LNA-modified oligonucleotides contain less than about 70%, more preferably less than about 60%, most preferably less than about 50% LNA monomers and that their sizes are between about 5 and 25 nucleotides, more preferably between about 12 and 20 nucleotides. Preferred modified oligonucleotide backbones comprise, but not limited to, phosphorothioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates, phosphotriesters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, methyl and other alkyl phosphonates comprising 3′alkylene phosphonates and chiral phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates comprising 3′-amino phosphoramidate and aminoalkylphosphoramidates, thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphonates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, and boranophosphates having normal 3′-5′ linkages, 2′-5′ linked analogs of these, and those having inverted polarity wherein the adjacent pairs of nucleoside units are linked 3′-5′ to 5′-3′ or 2′-5′ to 5′-2′.

Drug discovery: The compounds of the present invention can also be applied in the areas of drug discovery and target validation. The present invention comprehends the use of the compounds and preferred target segments identified herein in drug discovery efforts to elucidate relationships that exist between Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2) polynucleotides and a disease state, phenotype, or condition. These methods include detecting or modulating UCP2 polynucleotides comprising contacting a sample, tissue, cell, or organism with the compounds of the present invention, measuring the nucleic acid or protein level of UCP2 polynucleotides and/or a related phenotypic or chemical endpoint at some time after treatment, and optionally comparing the measured value to a non-treated sample or sample treated with a further compound of the invention. These methods can also be performed in parallel or in combination with other experiments to determine the function of unknown genes for the process of target validation or to determine the validity of a particular gene product as a target for treatment or prevention of a particular disease, condition, or phenotype. Assessing Up-Regulation or Inhibition of Gene Expression: Transfer of an exogenous nucleic acid into a host cell or organism can be assessed by directly detecting the presence of the nucleic acid in the cell or organism. Such detection can be achieved by several methods well known in the art. For example, the presence of the exogenous nucleic acid can be detected by Southern blot or by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique using primers that specifically amplify nucleotide sequences associated with the nucleic acid. Expression of the exogenous nucleic acids can also be measured using conventional methods including gene expression analysis. For instance, mRNA produced from an exogenous nucleic acid can be detected and quantified using a Northern blot and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Expression of RNA from the exogenous nucleic acid can also be detected by measuring an enzymatic activity or a reporter protein activity. For example, antisense modulatory activity can be measured indirectly as a decrease or increase in target nucleic acid expression as an indication that the exogenous nucleic acid is producing the effector RNA. Based on sequence conservation, primers can be designed and used to amplify coding regions of the target genes. Initially, the most highly expressed coding region from each gene can be used to build a model control gene, although any coding or non coding region can be used. Each control gene is assembled by inserting each coding region between a reporter coding region and its poly(A) signal. These piasmids would produce an mRNA with a reporter gene in the upstream portion of the gene and a potential RNAi target in the 3′ non-coding region. The effectiveness of individual antisense oligonucleotides would be assayed by modulation of the reporter gene. Reporter genes useful in the methods of the present invention include acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS), alkaline phosphatase (AP), beta galactosidase (LacZ), beta glucoronidase (GUS), chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), green fluorescent protein (GFP), red fluorescent protein (RFP), yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), cyan fluorescent protein (CFP), horseradish peroxidase (HRP), luciferase (Luc), nopaline synthase (NOS), octopine synthase (OCS), and derivatives thereof. Multiple selectable markers are available that confer resistance to ampicillin, bleomycin, chloramphenicol, gentamycin, hygromycin, kanamycin, lincomycin, methotrexate, phosphinothricin, puromycin, and tetracycline. Methods to determine modulation of a reporter gene are well known in the art, and include, but are not limited to, fLuorometric methods (e.g. fluorescence spectroscopy, Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS), fluorescence microscopy), antibiotic resistance determination. UCP2 protein and mRNA expression can be assayed using methods known to those of skill in the art and described elsewhere herein. For example, immunoassays such as the ELISA can be used to measure protein levels. UCP2 ELISA assay kits are available commercially, e.g., from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, Minn.). In embodiments, UCP2 expression (e.g., mRNA or protein) in a sample (e.g., cells or tissues in vivo or in vitro) treated using an antisense oligonucleotide of the invention is evaluated by comparison with UCP2 expression in a control sample. For example, expression of the protein or nucleic acid can be compared using methods known to those of skill in the art with that in a mock-treated or untreated sample. Alternatively, comparison with a sample treated with a control antisense oligonucleotide (e.g., one having an altered or different sequence) can be made depending on the information desired. In another embodiment, a difference in the expression of the UCP2 protein or nucleic acid in a treated vs. an untreated sample can be compared with the difference in expression of a different nucleic acid (including any standard deemed appropriarc by the researcher, e.g., a housekeeping gene) in a treated sample vs. an untreated sample. Observed differences can be expressed as desired, e.g., in the form of a ratio or fraction, for use in a comparison with control. In embodiments, the level of UCP2 mRNA or protein, in a sample treated with an antisense oligonucleotide of the present invention, is increased or decreased by about 1.25-fold to about 10-fold or more relative to an untreated sample or a sample treated with a control nucleic acid. In embodiments, the level of UCP2 mRNA or protein is increased or decreased by at least about 1.25-fold at least about 1.3-fold, at least about 1.4-fold, at least about 1.5-fold, at least about 1.6-fold, at least about 1.7-fold, at least about 1.8-fold, at least about 2-fold, at least about 2.5-fold, at least about 3-fold, at least about 3.5-fold, at least about 4-fold, at least about 4.5-fold, at least about 5-fold, at least about 5.5-fold, at least about 6-fold, at least about 6.5-fold, at least about 7-fold, at least about 7.5-fold, at least about 8-fold, at least about 8.5-fold, at least about 9-fold, at least about 9.5-fold, or at least about 10-fold or more. Kits, Research Reagents, Diagnostics, and Therapeutics The compounds of the present invention can be utilized for diagnostics, therapeutics, and prophylaxis, and as research reagents and components of kits. Furthermore, antisense oligonucleotides, which are able to inhibit gene expression wilh exquisite specificity, are often used by those of ordinary skill to elucidate the function of particular genes or to distinguish between functions of various members of a biological pathway. For use in kits and diagnostics and in various biological systems, the compounds of the present invention, either alone or in combination with other compounds or therapeutics, are useful as tools in differential and/or combinatorial analyses to elucidate expression patterns of a portion or the entire complement of genes expressed within cells and tissues. As used herein the term “biological system” or “system” is defined as any organism, cell, cell culture or tissue that expresses, or is made competent to express products of the Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2) genes. These include, but are not limited to, humans, transgenic animals, cells, cell cultures, tissues, xenografts, transplants and combinations thereof. As one non limiting example, expression patterns within cells or tissues treated with one or more antisense compounds are compared to control cells or tissues not treated with antisense compounds and the patterns produced are analyzed for differential levels of gene expression as they pertain, for example, to disease association, signaling pathway, cellular localization, expression level, size, structure or function of the genes examined. These analyses can be performed on stimulated or unstimulated cells and in the presence or absence of other compounds that affect expression patterns. Examples of methods of gene expression analysis known in the art include DNA arrays or microarrays, SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression), READS (restriction enzyme amplification of digested cDNAs), TOGA (total gene expression analysis), protein arrays and protromirs, expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing, subtractive RNA fingerprinting (SuRF), subtractivc cloning, differential display (DD), comparative genomic hybridization, FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) techniques and mass spectrometry methods. The compounds of the invention are useful for research and diagnostics, because these compounds hybridize to nucleic acids encoding Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2). For example, oligonucleotides that hybridize with such efficiency and under such conditions as disclosed herein as to be effective UCP2 modulators are effective primers or probes under conditions favoring gene amplification or detection, respectively. These primers and probes are useful in methods requiring the specific detection of nucleic acid molecules encoding UCP2 and in the amplification of said nucleic acid molecules for detection or for use in further studies of UCP2. Hybridization of the antisense oligonucleotides, particularly the primers and probes, of the invention with a nucleic acid encoding UCP2 can be detected by means known in the art. Such means may include conjugation of an enzyme to the oligonucleotide, radiolabchng of the oligonucleotide, or any other suitable detection means. Kits using such detection means for detecting the level of UCP2 in a sample may also be prepared. The specificity and sensitivity of antisense are also harnessed by those of skill in the art for therapeutic uses. Antisense compounds have been employed as therapeutic moieties in the treatment of disease stares in animals, including humans. Antisense oligonucleotide drugs have been safely and effectively administered to humans and numerous clinical trials are presently underway. It is thus established that antisense compounds can be useful therapeutic modalities that can be configured to be useful in treatment regimes for the treatment of cells, tissues and animals, especially humans. For therapeutics, an animal, preferably a human, suspected of having a disease or disorder which can be treated by modulating the expression of UCP2 polynucleotides is treated by administering antisense compounds in accordance with this invention. For example, in one non-limiting embodiment, the methods comprise the step of administering to the animal in need of treatment, a therapeutically effective amount of UCP2 modulator. The UCP2 modulators of the present invention effectively modulate the activity of the UCP2 or modulate the expression of the UCP2 protein. In one embodiment, the activity or expression of UCP2 in an animal is inhibited by about 10% as compared to a control. Preferably, the activity or expression of UCP2 in an animal is inhibited by about 30%. More preferably, the activity, or expression of UCP2 in an animal is inhibited by 50% or more. Thus, the oligomeric compounds modulate expression of Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2) mRNA by at least 10%, by at least 50%, by at least 25%, by at least 30%, by at least 40%, by at least 50%, by at least 60%, by at least 70%, by at least 75%, by at least 80%, by at least 85%, by at least 90%, by at least 95%, by at least 98%, by at least 99%, or by 100% as compared to a control. In one embodiment, the activity or expression of Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2) and/or in an animal is increased by about 10% as compared to a control. Preferably, the activity or expression of UCP2 in an animal is increased by about 30%. More preferably, the activity or expression of UCP2 in an animal is increased by 50% or more. Thus, the oligomeric compounds modulate expression of UCP2 mRNA by at least 10%, by at least 50%, by at least 25%, by at least 30%, by at least 40%, by at least 50%, by at least 60%, by at least 70%, by at least 75%, by at least 80%, by at least 85%, by at least 90%, by at least 95%, by at least 98%, by at least 99%, or by 100% as compared to a control. For example, the reduction of the expression of Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2) may be measured in scrum, blood, adipose tissue, liver or any other body fluid, tissue or organ of the animal. Preferably, the cells contained within said fluids, tissues or organs being analyzed contain a nucleic acid molecule encoding UCP2 peptides and/or the UCP2 protein itself. The compounds of the invention can be utilized in pharmaceutical compositions by adding an effective amount of a compound to a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier. Use of the compounds and methods of the invention may also be useful prophylactically. Conjugates Another modification of the oligonucleotides of the invention involves chemically linking to the oligonucleotide one or more moieties or conjugates that enhance the activity, cellular distribution or cellular uptake of the oligonucleotide. These moieties or conjugates can include conjugate groups covalentiy bound to functional groups such as primary or secondary hydroxyl groups. Conjugate groups of the invention include intercacators, reporter molecules, polyamines, polyamides, polyethylene glycols, polyethers, groups that enhance the pharmacodynamic properties of oligomers, and groups that enhance the pharmacokinetic properties of oligomers. Typical conjugate groups include cholesterols, lipids, phospholipids, biotin, phenazine, folate, phenanthridine, anthraquinone, acridine, fluoresceins, rhodamines, coumarins, and dyes.

Although, the antisense oligonucleotides do not need to be administered in the context of a vector in order to modulate a target expression and/or function, embodiments of the invention relates to expression vector constructs for the expression of antisense oligonucleotides, comprising promoters, hybrid promoter gene sequences and possess a strong constitutive promoter activity, or a promoter activity which can be induced in the desired case. In an embodiment, invention practice involves administering at least one of the foregoing antisense oligonucleotides with a suitable nucleic acid delivery system. In one embodiment, that system includes a non-viral vector operably linked to the polynucleotide. Examples of such nonviral vectors include the oligonucleotide alone (e.g. any one or more of SEQ ID NOS: 4 to 14) or in combination with a suitable protein, polysaccharide or lipid formulation. Additionally suitable nucleic acid delivery systems include viral vector, typically sequence from at least one of an adenovirus, adenovirus-associated vims (AAV), helper-dependent adenovirus, retrovirus, or hemagglutinatin virus of Japan-liposome (HVJ) complex. Preferably, the viral vector comprises a strong eukaryotic promoter operably linked to the polynucleotide e.g., a cytomegalovirus (CMV)promoter. Additionally preferred vectors include viral vectors, fusion proteins and chemical conjugates. Retroviral vectors include Moloney murine leukemia viruses and HIV-based viruses. One preferred HIV-based viral vector comprises at least two vectors wherein the gag and pol genes are from an HIV genome and the env gene is from another virus. DNA viral vectors are preferred. These vectors include pox vectors such as orthopox or avipox vectors, herpesvirus vectors such as a herpes simplex 1 virus (HSV) vector. Adenovirus Vectors and Adeno-associated Virus Vectors. The antisense compounds of the invention encompass any pharmaceutieatiy acceptable salts, esters, or salts of such esters, or any other compound which, upon administration to an animal, including a human, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) the biologically active metabolite or residue thereof. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salts” refers to physiologically and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of the invention: i.e., salts that retain the desired biological activity of the parent compound and do not impart undesired toxicological effects thereto. For oligonucleotides, preferred examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts and their uses are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,287,860, which is incorporated herein by reference. The present invention also includes pharmaceutical compositions and formulations that include the antisense compounds of the invention. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be administered in a number of ways depending upon whether local or systemic treatment is desired and upon the area to be treated. Administration may be topical (including ophthalmic and to mucous membranes including vaginal and rectal delivery), pulmonary, e.g., by inhalation or insufflation of powders or aerosols, including by nebulizer; intratracheal, intranasal, epidermal and transdermal), oral or parenteral. Parenteral administration includes intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intraperitoneal or intramuscular injection or infusion; or intracranial, e.g., intrathecal or intraventricular, administration. For treating tissues in the central nervous system, administration can be made by, e.g., injection or infusion into the cerebrospinal fluid. Administration of antisense RNA into cerebrospinal fluid is described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. App. Pub No. 2007/0117772, “Methods for slowing familial ALS disease progression,” incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. When it is intended that the antisense oligonucleotide of the present invention be administered to cells in the central nervous system, administration can be with one or more agents capable of promoting penetration of the subject antisense oligonucleotide across the blood-brain barrier. Injection can be made, e.g., in the entorhinal cortex or hippocampus. Delivery of neurotrophic factors by administration of an adenovirus vector to motor neurons in muscle tissue is described in e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,632,427, “Adenoviral-vector-mediated gene transfer into medullary motor neurons,” incorporated herein by reference. Delivery of vectors directly to the brain, e.g., the striatum, the thalamus, the hippocampus, or the substantia nigra, is known in the art and described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,756,523. “Adenovirus vectors for the transfer of foreign genes into cells of the central nervous system particularly in brain,” incorporated herein by reference. Administration can be rapid as by injection or made over a period of time as by slow infusion or administration of slow release formulations. The subject antisense oligonucleotides can also be linked or conjugated with agents that provide desirable pharmaceutical or pharmacodynamic properties. For example, the antisense oligonucleotide can be coupled to any substance, known in the an to promote penetration or transport across the blood-brain barrier, such as an antibody to the transferrin receptor, and administered by intravenous injection. The antisense compound can be linked with a viral vector, for example, that makes the antisense compound more effective and/or increases, the transport of the antisense compound across the blood-brain barrier. Osmotic blood brain barrier disruption can also be accomplished by, e.g., infusion of sugars including, but not limited to, meso erythritol, xylitel, D(+) galactose, D(+) lactose, D(+) xylose, dulcirol, myo-inositol, L(−) fructose, D(−) mannitol, D(+) glucose, D(+) arabinose, D(−) arabinose, cellobiose, D(+) maltose, D(+) raffinnose, L(+) rhamnose, D(+) melibiose, D(−) ribose, adonitol, D(+) arabitol, L(−) arabitol, D(+) fucose, L(−) fucose, D(−) lycose, L(+) lyxose, and L(−) lyxose, or amino acids including, but not limited to, glutamine, lysine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, threonine, tyrosine, valine, and taurine. Methods and materials for enhancing blood brain barrier penetration are described, e.g. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,866,042, “Method for the delivery of genetic material across the blood brain barrier,” U.S. Pat. No. 6,294,520, “Material for passage through the blood-brain barrier,” and U.S. Pat. No. 6,936,589, “Parenteral delivery systems,” all incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. The subject antisense compounds may be admixed, encapsulated, conjugated or otherwise associated with oihcr molecules, molecule structures or mixtures of compounds, for example, liposomes, receptor-targeted molecules, oral, rectal, topical or other formulations, for assisting in uptake, distribution and/or absorption. For example, cationie lipids may be included in the formulation to facilitate oligonucleotide uptake. One such composition shown to facilitate uptake is LIPOFECTIN (available from GIBCO-BRL, Bethesda, Md.). Oligonucleotides with at least one 2′-O-methoxyethyl modification are believed to be particularly useful for oral administration. Pharmaceutical compositions and formulations for topical administration may include transdermal patches, ointments, lotions, creams, gels, drops, suppositories, sprays, liquids and powders. Conventional pharmaceutical carriers, aqueous, powder or oily bases, thickeners and the like may be necessary or desirable. Coated condoms, gloves and the tike may also be useful. The pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention, which may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form, may be prepared according to conventional techniques well known in the pharmaceutical industry. Such techniques include the step of bringing into association the active ingredients with the pharmaceutical carrier(s) or excipient(s). In general, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active ingredients with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product. The compositions of the present invention may be formulated into any of many possible dosage forms such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gel capsules, liquid syrups, soft gels, suppositories, and enemas. The compositions of the present invention may also be formulated as suspensions in aqueous, non-aqueous or mixed media. Aqueous suspensions may further contain substances mat increase the viscosity of the suspension including, for example, sodium carboxymethyfcclluiose, sorbitol and/or dextran. The suspension may also contain stabilizers. Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include, but are not limited to, solutions, emulsions, foams and liposcme-containing formulations. The pharmaceutical compositions and formulations of the present invention may comprise one or more penetration enhancers, carriers, excipients or other active or inactive ingredients. Emulsions are typically heterogeneous systems of one liquid dispersed in another in the form of droplets usually exceeding 0.1 μm in diameter. Emulsions may contain additional components in addition to the dispersed phases, and the active drug that may be present as a solution in either the aqueous phase, oily phase or itself as a separate phase. Microcmulsions are included as an embodiment of the present invention. Emulsions and their uses are well known in the art and are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,287,860. Formulations of the present invention include liposomal formulations. As used in the present invention, the term “liposome” means a vesicle composed of amphiliphilic lipids arranged in a spherical bilayer or bilayers. Liposomes are unilamellar or multilamellar vesicles which have a membrane formed from a lipophilic material and an aqueous interior that contains the composition to be delivered. Cationic liposomes are positively charged liposomes that are believed to interact with negatively charged DNA molecules to form a stable complex. Liposomes that are pH-scnsitivc or negatively-charged are believed to entrap DNA rather than complex with it. Both cationic and noncationtc liposomes have been used to deliver DNA to cells. Liposomes also include “stericaily stabilized” liposomes, a term which, as used herein, refers to liposomes comprising one or more specialized lipids. When incorporated into liposomes, these specialized lipids result in liposomes with enhanced circulation lifetimes relative to liposomeslacking such specialized lipids. Examples of sterically stabilized liposomes are those in which part of the vesicle-forming lipid portion of the liposome comprises otic or more glycolipids or is derivatized with one or more hydrophilic polymers, such as a polyethylene glycol (PEG) moiety. Liposomes and their uses are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,287,860. The pharmaceutical formulations and compositions of the present invention may also include surfactants. The use of surfactants in drug products, formulations and m emulsions is well known in the art. Surfactants and their uses are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,287,860, which is incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment, the present invention employs various penetration enhancers to effect the efficient delivery of nucleic acids, particularly oligonucleotides. In addition to aiding the diffusion of non-lipophilic drugs across cell membranes, penetration enhancers also enhance the permeability of lipophilic drugs. Penetration enhancers may be classified as belonging to one of five broad categories, i.e., surfactants, fatty acids, bile salts, chelating agents, and non-chelating nonsurfactants. Penetration enhancers and their uses are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,287,860, which is incorporated herein by reference. One of skill in the art will recognize that formulations are routinely designed according to their intended use, i.e. route of administration. Preferred formulations for topical administration include those in which the oligonucleotides of the invention are in admixture with a topical delivery agent such as lipids, liposomes, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, steroids, chelating agents and surfactants. Preferred lipids and liposomes include neutral (e.g. dioleoyl-phosphatidyl DOPE ethanolamine, dimyristoylphosphatidyl choline DMPC, distearolyphosphatidyl choline) negative (e.g. dimyristoylphosphatidyl glycerol DMPG) and cationic (e.g. diolcoyltetramethylaminopropyl DOTAP and diolcoyl-phosphatidyl ethanolamine DOTMA). For topical or other administration, oligonucleotides of the invention may be encapsulated within liposomes or may form complexes thereto, in particular to cationic liposomes. Alternatively, oligonucleotides may be complexed to lipids, in particular to cationic lipids. Preferred fatty acids and esters, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, and their uses are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,287,860. Compositions and formulations for oral administration include powders or granules, microparticlates, nanoparticulatce, suspensions or solutions in water or non-aqueous media, capsules, gel capsules, sachets, tablets or minitablets. Thickeners, flavoring agents, diluents, emulsifiers, dispersing aids or binders may be desirable. Preferred oral formulations are those in which oligonucleotides of the invention are administered in conjunction with one or more penetration enhancers surfactants and chelators. Preferred surfactants include fatty acids and/or esters or salts thereof, bile acids and/or salts thereof. Preferred bile acids/salts and fatty acids and their uses are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,287,860, which is incorporated herein by reference. Also preferred are combinations of penetration enhancers, for example, fatty acids/salts in combination with bile acids/salts. A particularly preferred combination is the sodium salt of lauric acid, capric acid and UDCA. Further penetration enhancers include polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene-20-cetyl ether. Oligonucleotides of the invention may be delivered orally, in granular form including sprayed dried particles, or completed to form micro or nanoparticlcs. Oligonucleotide completing agents and their uses are further described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,287,860, which is incorporated herein by reference. Compositions and formulations for parenteral, intrathecal or intraventricular administration may include sterile aqueous solutions that may also contain buffers, diluents and other suitable additives such as, but not limited to, penetration enhancers, carrier compounds and other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients.

When used with the compounds of the invention, such chemotherapeutic agents may be used individually (e.g., 5-FU and oligonucleotide), sequentially (e.g., 5-FU and oligonucleotide for a period of time followed by MTX and oligonucleotide), or in combination with one or more other such chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., 5-FU, MTX and oligonucleotide, or 5-FU, radiotherapy and oligonucleotide). Anti-inflammatory drugs, including but not limited to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroids, and antiviral drugs, including but not limited to ribivirin, vidarabine, acyclovir and ganciclovir, may also be combined in compositions of the invention. Combinations of antisense compounds and other non-antisense drugs are also within the scope of this invention. Two or more combined compounds may be used together or sequentially. In another related embodiment, compositions of the invention may contain one or more antisense compounds, particularly oligonucleotides, targeted to a first nucleic acid and one or more additional antisense compounds targeted to a second nucleic acid target. For example, the first target may be a particular antisense sequence of Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2), and the second target may be a region from another nucleotide sequence. Alternatively, compositions of the invention may contain two or more antisense compounds targeted to different regions of the same Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2) nucleic acid target. Numerous examples of antisense compounds are illustrated herein and others may be selected from among suitable compounds known in the art. Two or more combined compounds may be used together or sequentially. Dosing: The formulation of therapeutic compositions and their subsequent administration (dosing) is believed to be within the skill of those in the art. Dosing is dependent on severity and responsiveness of the disease state to be treated, with the course of treatment lasting from several days to several months, or until a cure is effected or a diminution of the disease state is achieved. Optimal dosing schedules can be calculated from measurements of drug accumulation in the body of the patient. Persons of ordinary skill can easily determine optimum dosages, dosing methodologies and repetition rates. Optimum dosages may vary depending on the relative potency of individual oligonucleotides, and can generally be estimated based on EC50s found to be effective in vitro and in vivo animal models. In general, dosage is from 0.01 μg to 100 g per kg of body weight, and may be given once or more daily, weekly, monthly or yearly, or even once every 2 to 20 years. Persons of ordinary skill in the art can easily estimate repetition rates tor dosing based on measured residence times and concentrations of the drug in bodily fluids or tissues. Following successful treatment, it may be desirable to have the patient undergo maintenance therapy to prevent the recurrence of the disease state, wherein the oligonucleotide is administered in maintenance doses, ranging from 0.01 μg to 100 g per kg of body weight, once or more daily, to once every 20 years. In embodiments, a patient is treated with a dosage of drug that is at least about 1, at least about 2, at least about 3, at least about 4, at least about 5, at least about 6, at least about 7, at least about 8, at least about 9, at least about 10, at least about 15, at least about 20, at least about 25, at least about 30, at least about 35, at least about 40, at least about 45, at least about 50, at least about 60, at least about 70, at least about 80, at least about 90, or at least about 100 mg/kg body weight. Certain injected dosages of antisense oligonucleotides are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 7,563,884, “Antisense modulation of PTPIB expression,” incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. While various embodiments of tire present invention have been described above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and not limitation. Numerous changes to the disclosed embodiments can be made in accordance with the disclosure herein without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, the breadth and scope of the present invention should not be limited by any of the above described embodiments. All documents mentioned herein are incorporated herein by reference. All publications and patent documents cited in this application are incorporated by reference for all purposes to the same extent as if each individual publication or patent document were so individually denoted. By their citation of various references in this document, Applicants do not admit any particular reference is “prior art” to their invention. Embodiments of inventive compositions and methods are illustrated in the following examples. EXAMPLES The following non-limiting Examples serve to illustrate selected embodiments of the invention. It will be appreciated that variations in proportions and alternatives in elements of the components shown will be apparent to those skilled in the art and are within the scope of embodiments of the present invention. Example 1: Design of Antisense Oligonucleotides Specific for a Nucleic Acid Molecule Antisense to a Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2) and/or a Sense Strand of UCP2 Polynucleotide As indicated above the term “oligonucleotide specific for” or “oligonucleotide targets” refers to an oligonucleotide having a sequence (i) capable of forming a stable complex with a portion of the targeted gene, or (ii) capable of forming a stable duplex with a portion of an mRNA transcript of the targeted gene. Selection of appropriate oligonucleotides is facilitated by using computer programs that automatically align nucleic acid sequences and indicate regions of identity or homology. Such programs are used to compare nucleic acid sequences obtained, for example, by searching databases such as GenBank or by sequencing PCR products. Comparison of nucleic acid sequences from a range of species allows the selection of nucleic acid sequences that display an appropriate degree of identity between species. In the case of genes that have not been sequenced, Southern blots are performed to allow a determination of the degree of identity between genes in target species and other species. By performing Southern blots at varylng degrees of stringency, as is well known in the art, it is possible to obtain an approximate measure of identity. These procedures allow the selection of oligonucleotides that exhibit a high degree of complementarity to target nucleic acid sequences in a subject to be controlled and a lower degree of complementarity to corresponding nucleic acid sequences in other species. One skilled in the art will realize that there is considerable latitude in selecting appropriate regions of genes for use in the present invention. An antisense compound is “specifically hybridizable” when binding of the compound to the target nucleic acid interferes with the normal function of the target nucleic acid to cause a modulation of function and/or activity, and there is a sufficient degree of complementarity to avoid non-specific binding of the antisense compound to non-target nucleic acid sequences under conditions in which specific binding is desired, i.e., under physiological conditions in the case of in vivo assays or therapeutic treatment, and under conditions in which assays are performed in the case of in vitro assays The hybridization properties of the oligonucleotides described herein can be determined by one or more in vitro assays as known in the art. For example, the properties of the oligonucleotides described herein can be obtained by determination of binding strength between the target natural antisense and a potential drug molecules using melting curve assay. The binding strength between the target natural antisense and a potential drug molecule (Molecule) can be estimated using any of the established methods of measuring the strength of intermolecular interactions, for example, a melting curve assay. Melting curve assay determines the temperature at which a rapid transition from double-stranded to single-stranded conformation occurs for the natural antisense/Molecule complex. This temperature is widely accepted as a reliable measure of the interaction strength between the two molecules. A melting curve assay can be performed using a cDNA copy of the actual natural antisense RNA molecule or a synthetic DNA or RNA nucleotide corresponding to the binding site of the Molecule. Multiple kits containing all necessary reagents to perform this assay are available (e.g. Applied Biosystems Inc. MeltDoctor kit). These kits include a suitable buffer solution containing one of the double strand DNA (dsDNA) binding dyes (such as AB1 HRM dyes, SYBR Green, SYTO, etc.). The properties of the dsDNA dyes are such that they emit almost no fluorescence in free form, but are highly fluorescent when bound to dsDNA. To perform the assay the cDNA or a corresponding oligonucleotide are mixed with Molecule in concentrations defined by the particular manufacturer's protocols. The mixture is heated to 95° C. to dissociate all pre-formed dsDNA complexes, then slowly cooled to room temperature or other lower temperature defined by the kit manufacturer to allow the DNA molecules to anneal. The newly formed complexes are then slowly heated to 95° C. with simultaneous continuous collection of data on the amount of fluorescence that is produced by the reaction. The fluorescence intensity is inversely proportional to the amounts of dsDNA present in the reaction. The data can be collected using a real time PCR instrument compatible with the kit (e.g. ABI's StepOne Plus Real Time PCR System or lightTyper instrument, Roche Diagnostics, Lewes, UK). Melting peaks are constructed by plotting the negative derivative of fluorescence with respect to temperature (−d(Fluoresccnce)/dT) on the y-axis) against temperature (x-axis) using appropriate software (for example lightTyper (Roche) or SDS Dissociation Curve, ABI). The data is analyzed to identify the temperature of the rapid transition from dsDNA complex to single strand molecules. This temperature is called Tm and is directly proportional to the strength of interaction between the two molecules. Typically, Tm will exceed 40° C. Example 2: Modulation of UCP2 Polynucleotides Treatment of HEPG2 Cells with Antisense Oligonucleotides HepG2 cells from ATCC (cat# HB-8065) were grown in growth media (MEM/EBSS (Hyclone cat #SH30024, or Mediatech cat #MT-10-010-CV)+10% FBS (Mediatech cat#MT35-011-CV)+penicillin/streptomycin (Mediatech cat#MT30-002-CI)) at 37° C. and 5% CO2. On the day of the experiment the media in the 6 well plates was changed to fresh growth media. All antisense oligonucleotides were diluted to the concentration of 20 μM. Two μl of this solution was incubated with 400 μl of Opti-MEM media (Gibco cat#31985-070) and 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen cat# 11668019) at room temperature for 20 min and applied to each well of the 6 well plates with HEPG2 cells. A Similar mixture including 2 μl of water instead of the oligonucleotide solution was used for the mock-transfected controls. After 3-18 h of incubation at 37° C. and 5% CO2 the media was changed to fresh growth media 48 h after addition of antisense oligonucleotides the media was removed and RNA was extracted from the cells using SV Total RNA Isolation System from Promega (cat #Z3105) or RNeasy Total RNA isolation kit from Qiagen (cat#74381) following the manufacturers' instructions. 600 ng of RNA was added to the reverse transcription reaction performed using Verso cDNA kit from Thermo Scientific (cat#AB1453B) or High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (cat# 4368813) as described in the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA from this reverse transcription reaction was used to monitor gene expression by real time PCR using ABI Taqman Gene Expression Mix (cat#4369510) and primers/probes designed by ABI (Applied Biosystems Taqman Gene Expression Assay: Hs00163349_ml by Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City Calif.). The following PCR cycle was used: 50° C. for 2 min, 95° C. for 10 min, 40 cycles of (95° C. for 15 seconds, 60° C. for 1 min) using Mx4000 thermal cycler (Stratagene). Fold change in gene expression after treatment with antisense oligonucleotides was calculated based on the difference in 18S-normalized dCt values between treated and mock-transfected samples. Results: Real time PCR results show that the levels of UCP2 mRNA in HepG2 cells are significantly increased 48 h after treatment with two oligonucleotides designed so UCP2 antisense Hs.627373 and two oligonucleotides designed to Sorgelawbu.aApr07 UCP2 (FIG. 1).
