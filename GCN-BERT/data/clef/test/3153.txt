The present invention generally relates to equipment for the manufacturing of hollow containers such as glass bottles and in particular to a molding assembly comprising a mold with three radial sectors and a related mold-holder. Blow molding is a manufacturing process used to manufacture hollow containers such as bottles or vials made of materials such as glass or plastic. Blow molding is carried out by blowing compressed air inside a preform arranged in a mold inside which a cavity having the negative shape of the container to be manufactured is formed. By blowing compressed air into the preform this is expanded so as to contact the cavity walls, thus assuming the desired shape. The hollow container so obtained is then cooled inside the mold, which is then opened in order to allow to extract the finished product. A mold for molding hollow containers such as glass bottles comprises a body having a generally cylindrical shape and made of cast iron, a bronze alloy or, more generally, of a material featuring high thermal conductivity. A cavity having the negative shape of a bottle to be manufactured is formed inside the cylindrical body. The cylindrical body of the mold is generally provided with a flange radially protruding from its shell that allows mounting of the body on a suitable mold-holder. The mold and the mold-holder form a molding assembly intended to be mounted on a molding machine. In order to allow extraction of a finished bottle, the cylindrical body of the mold is made up of two or three separable radial sectors every one of which comprises a portion of the flange. The mold-holder comprises two or three arms hinged to each other and configured so as to allow mounting of the radial sectors of the mold at the respective flange portions. Mold-holders having three arms configured for mounting molds comprising three radial sectors are more bulky and heavy than those comprising two arms, which makes their positioning and assembling on a molding machine more difficult. Moreover, mold-holders with three arms are more complex and expensive than those having two arms. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a molding assembly for the manufacturing of hollow containers which can overcome these drawbacks. Said object is achieved with a molding assembly whose main features are specified in the first claim, while other features are specified in the remaining claims. An idea of solution underlying the invention is to modify a mold-holder having two arms so as to allow mounting, opening and closing of a mold having a body with three radial sectors. A first and a second radial sector of the mold are respectively mounted on the first and the second arms of the mold-holder and are rotatable therewith about its rotation axis, while a third radial sector of the mold is restrained to both the first and the second arms of the mold-holder through a kinematic chain configured so as to cause it to make a translation movement from and towards the axis of the mold-holder simultaneously with the rotation of the first and the second arms. The main advantage offered by the invention is therefore to allow a remarkable simplification of the molding assemblies comprising molds made up of three radial sectors, which allows an easier positioning and assembling onto a molding machine. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the kinematic chain comprises a pair of pins respectively fitted in a pair of slots. The pins are e.g. associated with the third radial sector of the mold, while the slots are e.g. associated to the arms of the mold-holder. Alternatively and in a completely equivalent manner, the pins may be associated to the arms of the mold-holder and the slots may be formed on the flanged portion of the third radial sector of the mold. The slots are preferably formed on metal plates fixed in a removable manner on the arms of the mold-holder or on the flanged portion of the third radial sector of the mold, and the pins are removably restrained to the flanged portion of the third radial sector of the mold or to the arms of the mold-holder. This configuration is advantageous in that it allows to replace pins and slots when they are worn, damaged or broken. A further advantage offered by this configuration of pins and slots is that their removal allows to use the two arms mold-holder with prior art molds having two sectors. The mold-holder may also advantageously comprise a second kinematic chain configured to cooperate with the first kinematic chain so as to ensure that the movements of the third radial sector of the mold are exclusively translation movements and occur in a same radial direction. Asynchronous rotations of the arms of the mold-holder in fact would cause rotations of the third radial sector of the mold, resulting in the need to rotate the third radial sector into the correct position by contact with the first and second radial sectors when closing the mold. This is undesirable, because it causes wear of the radial sectors of the mold, sealing problems during a molding process and, more generally, quality problems of the finished product. Further advantages and features of the molding assembly according to the present invention will become clear to those skilled in the art from the following detailed and non-limiting description of an embodiment thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: Figure 1 is a perspective view showing a molding assembly according to the invention in a closed configuration;Figure 2 is a perspective view showing the molding assembly of figure 1 in an open configuration;Figure 3 is a top plan view of the molding assembly in a closed configuration;Figure 4 is a top plan view of the molding assembly in an open configuration;Figure 5 is an exploded perspective view of the molding assembly according to the invention. Referring to the drawings, the molding assembly according to the invention is generally indicated by reference numeral 100 and comprises a mold 200 for molding hollow containers such as glass bottles and a mold-holder 300 configured to support it and allow it to be used on a molding machine. Reference will be made in the following to the manufacturing of glass bottles only, being it understood that the molding assembly according to the invention is not limited to this type of hollow containers nor to any material, and that the molding assembly could be also used in the manufacturing of hollow containers made of different materials and having different shapes, provided that they are made by blow forming with air or gas under pressure. The mold 200 comprises a body 210 having a generally cylindrical shape provided with a flange radially protruding from its shell and configured so as to allow mounting of the body on the mold-holder 300, as will be described in greater detail below. The body 210 includes an axis A, which is a substantially vertical axis in an operating condition thereof, and an internal cavity 211 suitable for receiving a preform of a container to be manufactured along that axis. The internal cavity 211 has an opening formed on the top of the cylindrical body 210 so as to allow insertion of the preform and insufflation of air or gas under pressure. The cavity is closed at the bottom by a bottom plate 220 of the mold 200. For ease of representation, this cavity has a cylindrical shape in the drawings, but it will be appreciated that it could have any other shape as well, such as the typical shape of a bottle comprising an upper neck portion and a lower container portion having a larger diameter. In order to allow extraction of a bottle from the mold 200, the latter is made up of a plurality of separable sectors, in particular three separable radial sectors 212, 213, 214. Each radial sector 212, 213, 214 comprises a portion 222, 223, 224 of the flange of the cylindrical body 210. Each radial sector 212, 213, 214 preferably angularly extends over an arc of 120Â° along the circumferential direction. The mold-holder 300 comprises a first and a second arms 310, 320 pivotally restrained to each other about an axis B, which is a substantially vertical axis in an operating condition similarly to the axis A of the cylindrical body 210. As shown in the drawings, through openings may be formed in the arms 310, 320 so as to reduce the overall weight of the mold-holder. A first and a second radial sectors 212, 213 of the body 210 of the mold 200 are respectively restrained to the first and second arms 310, 320 of the mold-holder 300 at their respective flange portions 222, 223 and are rotatable therewith about the axis B. In the illustrated embodiment, the restraining means between the first and the second arms 310, 320 and the flange portions 222, 223 of the first and second radial sectors 212, 213 comprise, for example ribs 310a, 320a formed in low relief on the top of the arms and slots 222a, 223a having a matching shape formed on the lower surface of the flange portions 222, 223 of the radial sectors 212, 213. The fastening means also comprise dowels 310b, 320b protruding from the top of the arms 310, 320 and recesses 222b, 223b of matching shape formed in the radial direction on the flange portions 222, 223 of the first and second radial sectors 212, 213. A third radial sector 214 of the body 210 of the mold 200 is instead restrained to both the first and the second arms 310, 320 of the mold-holder 300 through a kinematic chain configured so as to cause it to make a translation movement from and towards the axis B of the mold-holder simultaneously with the rotation of the first and the second arms 310, 320. In a closed configuration of the mold 200, the third radial sector 214 contacts the first and the second sectors 212, 213 and is arranged between them and the rotation axis B of the mold-holder 300. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the kinematic chain is a cam-follower mechanism and comprises a pair of guiding slots 410, 420 respectively associated to the arms 310, 320 of the mold-holder 300 and a pair of pins 510, 520 respectively associated with the portion of flange 224 of the third radial sector 214, wherein each pin 510, 520 engages one of the guiding slots 410, 420. Thanks to this configuration, the rotation of the arms 310, 320 of the mold-holder 300 cause at the same time a relative displacement between the pins 510, 520 and the guiding slots 410, 420 which results in a translation movement of the third sector 214 from and towards the axis B of the mold-holder 300. In the illustrated embodiment, the guiding slots 410, 420 are close to the axis B of the mold-holder 300. The pins 510, 520 are preferably fitted in a removable manner in suitable holes formed in the flange portion 224 of the third radial sector 214, so that they may be replaced if worn out or broken. It will be understood that, in an entirely equivalent way, the slots 410, 420 may be formed on the flange portion 224 of the third radial sector 214 and the pins 510, 520 may be associated to the arms 310, 320 of the mold-holder 300. In the aim to minimize wear out problems caused by the sliding of the pins 510, 520 along the slots 410, 420, the latter are preferably formed as metal plates 430, 440 e.g. made of chrome steel and, more generally, of materials featuring a hardness greater than the hardness of the material forming the mold-holder, which is typically construction steel of the type Fe360 or the like. The metal plates 430, 440 are preferably mounted in a removable manner, for example by way of screws, on the arms 310, 320 of the mold-holder or on the flange portion 224 of the third radial sector 214 of the mold 200. This technical solution offers the additional advantage of allowing replacement of the guides 410, 420 when they are worn, damaged, or broken. It is also understood that kinematic chains equivalent to the cam-follower kinematic chain described above might be employed e.g. a set of articulated arms. The cam-follower solution is however preferred, because it is generally more compact and easier to implement and assemble. The molding assembly according to the invention may also advantageously comprise a further kinematic chain configured to facilitate and guide the translation movements of the third radial sector 214 of the mold 200 from and towards the axis B of the mold-holder 300. The further kinematic chain comprises in particular a radial rib 600 formed in low relief on one between the base of the third radial sector 214 and the bottom plate 220 of the mold 200 that cooperates with a slot 700 having a matching shape formed on the other one between the base of the third radial sector 214 and the bottom plate 220 of the mold 200. The function of these guiding means, 600, 700, is to ensure that displacements of the third radial sector 214 are exclusively translation movements along a radial direction. This condition in fact may only be achieved when rotation of the first and second radial sectors 212, 213 is synchronous, which in practice almost never occurs due to friction, as well as due to the manufacturing tolerances of the components of the mold and of the mold-holder and the like. Asynchronous rotations of the arms 310, 320 of the mold-holder 300 cause both a translation and a rotation movement of the third radial sector 214, so that when the mold 200 is closed the third radial sector 214 has to be rotated into the correct position by contact with the first and the second radial sectors 212, 213. This is undesirable, because it results in uneven wear of the radial sectors of the mold, sealing problems during the molding process and, more generally, quality problems of the finished products. According to a further aspect of the invention, the third radial sector 214 preferably comprises a flattened portion formed on its cylindrical shell and facing the axis B of the mold-holder 300. In this case, the flange portion 224 of the third radial sector 214 is formed also on the flattened portion. This configuration of the third radial sector 214 is advantageous in that it allows to reduce the overall size of the molding assembly 100 while ensuring adequate space for the assembly of the components that form the kinematic chain allowing the arms 310, 320 of the mold-holder 300 to move the third radial sector 214. According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the part of the flange portion 224 of the third radial sector 214 associated to its flattened portion is a removable element 224a fixed on the latter e.g. by way of screws. The holes intended to receive the pins 510, 520 are formed in the removable element 224a of the flange portion 224. The invention has been disclosed with reference to preferred embodiments.
