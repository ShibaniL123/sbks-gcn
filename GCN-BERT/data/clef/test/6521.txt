Detailed Description of the Drawin2S [0027] With reference to Figs. 1-9, a particular embodiment 10 of the portable liquid- recycling liquid-reusing cleaning apparatus, in accordance with the principles of the invention, is shown. The cleaning apparatus embodiment 10 includes a cleaning-liquid- dispensing-and-vacuum-recovery tank assembly 12, a spigot assembly 14, and a vacuum head assembly 16. [0028] The tank assembly 12 includes a cleaning-liquid-dispensing-and-vacuum- recovery tank 18, a chassis 20, and four swivel caster wheels as at 20. The tank has a top wall 24, a bottom wall 26, a front wall 28, a back wall 30, a left sidewall 32, and a right sidewall 34; and the tank defines an interior space 36 operable to hold cleaning liquid and soil. The tank also has a liquid dispensing outlet 38 at a lower portion of the back wall, and a vacuum recovery inlet 40 at a front left portion of the top wall. Both the liquid dispensing outlet and the vacuum recovery inlet are fluidly connected to the tank interior space. [0029] The tank top wall 24 has a large centrally located opening 42. When the vacuum head assembly 16 (discussed below) is in position, the vacuum head assembly is releasably and removably seated about the opening. The vacuum head assembly is secured to the tank by latches as at 44 that extend upward from the tank top wall. When the latches are released and the vacuum head assembly is lifted up and away from the centrally located opening, a user can easily access the tank interior space 36 via the opening. [0030] The spigot assembly 14 includes a spigot 46 and a spigot handle 48 connected to the spigot. The spigot is fluidly connected to the tank interior space 36 via the tank's liquid dispensing outlet 38. The spigot includes a valve 50 that facilitates the spigot's ability to dispense and regulate the flow of cleaning liquid from the tank 18 through the spigot onto hard surface flooring. The spigot handle is an elongated rod that extends upward from the spigot. The spigot handle has an upwardly extending section 52 and a horizontal section 54 at the top of the upwardly extending section. A frame 56 extends rearward from the back wall 30 of the tank; and the upwardly extending section of the spigot handle extends through an opening in the frame. [00311 In use, a user typically operates the spigot handle 48 by grasping the horizontal section 54 and turning the section to the right or to the left. The spigot 46 is manually adjustable through a range from a fully open position to a fully closed position, whereby when the tank 18 contains cleaning liquid, a user may dispense and regulate the flow of cleaning liquid from the tank through the spigot onto hard surface flooring by manually turning the spigot handle a desired amount to the right or to the left, thereby adjusting the spigot. [0032] Typically a portable liquid-recycling liquid-reusing cleaning apparatus of the present invention does not include a pump to assist in dispensing cleaning liquid from the tank through the spigot onto an area of hard surface flooring. Instead, such a cleaning apparatus uses the natural force of gravity to facilitate dispensing cleaning liquid from the tank. With reference to the Figures, the cleaning apparatus embodiment 10 is free of such a pump. [0033] As noted above, the vacuum head assembly 16 is releasably and removably positioned on the cleaning-liquid-dispensing-and- vacuum-recovery tank 18. The vacuum head assembly includes an outer housing 58, a vacuum motor assembly, and an automatic shutoff system in the form of a float shutoff assembly 62. The vacuum motor assembly is fluidly connected to the tank interior space 36, whereby a user may vacuum soil and dispensed cleaning liquid from hard surface flooring into the tank interior space via the tank' s vacuum recovery inlet 40. [0034] The outer housing 58 includes an on/off switch 64, a main handle 66, and a steering tab or handle 68. In use, a user may grasp or otherwise exert force on the steering tab 68 to facilitate moving (e.g., pushing or pulling) the portable liquid-recycling liquid-reusing cleaning apparatus 10. [0035] The vacuum motor assembly is an AC assembly powered by an AC electrical cord (not shown) connectable, for example, to a conventional wall outlet. Alternatively, the vacuum motor assembly may be a DC assembly powered by DC battery - for example, a battery or battery pack that is positioned on or mounted to the cleaning-liquid-dispensing- and-vacuum-recovery tank. If desired, the vacuum motor assembly may have the following specifications: two-stage vacuum motor; from about 60 to about 120 inches of water lift (deadhead); and from about 50 to about 120 CFM of open flow. [0036] The portable liquid-recycling liquid-reusing cleaning apparatus 10 also has an optional bag filter assembly 70 removably positioned in the tank interior space 36. With reference to Figs. 9-11, the bag filter assembly has a frame 72 and a bag filter 74 - with the bag filter opening connected to the frame so as to define a bag filter inlet 76. The interior of the tank 18 - from the vacuum recovery inlet 40 to the bag filter assembly 70 - is configured so as to direct soil and cleaning liquid toward the bag filter inlet. [0037] If desired, the bag filter may have a pore size of from about 25 microns to about 300 microns. Also, if desired, pore size may be selected based on the nature or characteristics of the soil(s) to be removed from a particular area or areas of hard surface flooring (e.g., size(s) of the soil particles). If desired, the bag filter assembly material(s) and construction may be such that the bag filter (or bag filter assembly) may be reused several times and then disposed of. The bag filter (or bag filter assembly) should be replaced as needed. Also, if desired, the bag filter may be made of a nylon mesh material. [0038] The bag filter assembly serves several purposes. For example, it filters out gross soils from the cleaning liquid such that the cleaning liquid may be recycled and reused more times. It also prevents large debris particles from getting into the drains and plumbing system(s) of the building or other facility being cleaned. In addition, the bag filter assembly facilitates cleanup of the cleaning apparatus. For example, when cleaning the interior of the tank, gross soils and large debris particles captured by the bag filter assembly may be readily removed from the tank by removing the filter assembly from the tank, emptying the contents of the filter assembly, and rinsing off the bag filter material. [0039] When a user vacuums soil and dispensed cleaning liquid from an area of hard surface flooring, the vacuumed soil and cleaning liquid move through the vacuum recovery inlet and the bag filter inlet into the tank interior space. Larger debris and other larger soil particles are retained in the bag filter; while smaller soil particles and recovered cleaning liquid may pass back and forth through the pores in the bag filter. Depending on soil particle size and settling time, some soil particles may settle on the interior surface of the tank bottom wall. [0040] The tank bottom wall 26 includes an interior surface 78 that assists in defining the tank interior space 36. The tank liquid dispensing outlet 38 is positioned above the tank bottom wall interior surface, thereby inhibiting soil that settles on the portion of the tank bottom wall interior surface from passing through the tank liquid dispensing outlet and spigot 46 onto the hard surface flooring when cleaning liquid is being dispensed. [0041 ] The tank 18 further includes a dump outlet 80 located at a lower portion of the tank front wall 28, with the dump outlet fluidly connected to the tank interior space 36. And the tank assembly 12 further includes a dump hose 82 fluidly connected to the dump outlet. In this fashion, when a user is done recycling and reusing the cleaning liquid, the user may drain cleaning liquid and soil from the tank interior space into a suitable receptacle or drain via the dump outlet and dump hose. [0042] In another embodiment of the cleaning apparatus (not shown), the tank may have a dump drain outlet including a valve - for use in draining cleaning liquid and soil from the tank interior space into a suitable receptacle or drain. The dump drain outlet may be provided either instead of or in addition to the dump outlet and dump hose described above. Such a dump drain outlet typically is located at the lowest point of the concave interior surface of the bottom wall (e.g., the center of the bottom wall interior surface). If desired, the valve may be a slide gate valve. [00431 With reference to Fig. 12, the portable liquid-recycling liquid-reusing cleaning apparatus embodiment 10 of Figs. 1-9 is shown in combination with a squeegee floor tool 84, a handheld vacuum wand 86, and a length of vacuum hose 88. The floor tool, vacuum wand, and vacuum hose are fluidly connected to the tank interior space 36 via the vacuum recovery inlet 40. With this combination, when the vacuum motor assembly is turned on, a user may vacuum soil and dispensed cleaning liquid from an area of hard surface flooring into the tank 18 via the floor tool, vacuum wand, and vacuum hose. Note that the hose as illustrated has what appears to be a short gap between two hose segments. The gap is merely for illustration purposes, and is used to indicate that the hose may be longer (or shorter) than depicted in Fig. 12. [0044] Referring to Fig. 13, the portable liquid-recycling liquid-reusing cleaning apparatus embodiment 10 of Figs. 1-9 is shown positioned on a janitor cart 90. The cleaning apparatus further includes a tubing segment 92, with one end of the segment connected to the spigot 46 and the other end of the segment extending downward toward the hard surface flooring. [0045] Any of the methods discussed below for cleaning hard surface flooring with a portable liquid-recycling liquid-reusing cleaning apparatus also may be used with a cleaning- apparatus-on-janitof-cart combination system of the present invention. In doing so. a user typically keeps the cleaning apparatus positioned on the janitor cart, and moves both the apparatus and the cart simply by moving (e.g.. pushing or pulling) the janitor cart. When the user wants to dispense cleaning liquid from the tank onto an area of hard surface flooring to be cleaned, the user manually turns (i.e., rotates) the spigot handle as described above; and the tubing segment directs the cleaning liquid from the spigot to the particular area. [0046] A portable liquid-recycling liquid-reusing cleaning apparatus of the present invention may be made using any suitable material(s) and manufacturing technique(s). For example, if desired, the cleaning-liquid-dispensing-and- vacuum-recovery tank and chassis may be made of polypropylene using thermoplastic injection molding. [0047] In use, a portable liquid-recycling liquid-reusing cleaning apparatus, in accordance with the principles of the invention, may be used to clean hard surface flooring in any of a number of ways. [0048] The present invention also is directed to methods of cleaning hard surface flooring with a portable liquid-recycling liquid-reusing cleaning apparatus. Such methods, in accordance with the principles of the invention, may involve any of a number of steps, and may have such steps arranged in any of a number of different ways. Typically, such methods employ a portable liquid-recycling liquid-reusing cleaning apparatus of the present invention. [0049] Some methods may include: dispensing fresh (or used (e.g., recovered)) cleaning liquid from a cleaning-liquid-dispensing-and-vacuum-recovery tank via a spigot onto an area of hard surface flooring; followed at some point by vacuuming soil and dispensed cleaning liquid from the flooring area into the tank via a vacuum recovery inlet, thereby removing soil and recovering cleaning liquid from the flooring area; followed at some point by dispensing recovered cleaning liquid from the tank via the spigot onto another area of hard surface flooring. If desired, such methods may further include vacuuming soil and dispensed cleaning liquid from the other flooring area into the tank via the vacuum recovery inlet, thereby removing soil and recovering cleaning liquid from the other flooring area. [0050] Typically the dispensing of cleaning liquid from the tank through the spigot onto one or more areas of hard surface flooring is performed without the assistance of a pump. Instead, the natural force of gravity is used to facilitate such dispensing of cleaning liquid from the tank. [00511 If desired, some methods also may include spreading and/or agitating cleaning liquid that has been dispensed (or is in the process of being dispensed) onto an area of hard surface flooring. If further desired, the spreading and/or agitating may be done manually by a user (e.g., using a mop, brush, squeegee, or other handheld spreading device). The spreading and/or agitation helps loosen soil from the flooring area and facilitates mixing of soil with dispensed cleaning liquid prior to vacuuming soil and dispensed cleaning liquid from the flooring area into the tank. [0052] In one cleaning method of the invention, a user dispenses cleaning liquid from a tank via a spigot onto one area of hard surface flooring, then onto another area of hard surface flooring - prior to vacuuming soil and dispensed cleaning liquid from either of the two areas into the tank. If desired, this may be done for convenience, or it may be done to extend the dwell time of the cleaning liquid. The two areas may be in a single room or may be in two rooms (e.g., a kitchen and a lobby of a restaurant). The user then vacuums soil and dispensed cleaning liquid from the two areas into the tank. Then the user dispenses recovered cleaning liquid from the tank via the spigot onto yet an additional area of hard surface flooring, followed by vacuuming up soil and dispensed cleaning liquid from the additional area. The additional area may be in the same single room, or if two rooms, then in one of the same two rooms. Alternatively, the additional area may be in a third room (e.g., a restroom of a restaurant). [0053] With reference to Fig. 14, an example of a method of cleaning hard surface flooring with the portable liquid-recycling liquid-reusing cleaning apparatus embodiment 10, in accordance with the principles of the invention, is shown. [0054] As shown at 100, a user fills the cleaning-liquid-dispensing-and-vacuum- recovery tank 18 with a fresh cleaning liquid - for example, water or another cleaning liquid or solution. If desired, the user may fill the tank with cleaning liquid by exposing the large centrally located opening 42 at the tank top wall 24 (i.e., central opening 42), and pouring cleaning liquid through the central opening 42 into the tank interior space 36. The user may access the central opening 42 by opening the latches as at 44 that assist in releasably securing the vacuum head assembly 16 and the tank assembly 12 to one another, and removing the vacuum head assembly 16. Once the user has added a desired amount of cleaning liquid to the tank, the user may reseat the vacuum head assembly about the central opening and may close the latches, thereby resecuring the vacuum head assembly and the tank assembly to each other. If the cleaning apparatus 10 is not already on the area of hard surface flooring to be cleaned, the user moves (e.g., pushes or pulls) the cleaning apparatus to the desired location. [0055] In other method embodiments of the present invention, if desired, a user may fill the tank with a used cleaning liquid - preferably a recycled cleaning liquid. For example, a user may fill the tank by vacuuming previously dispensed cleaning liquid into the tank. [0056] At 102, the user dispenses a desired amount of fresh cleaning liquid through the spigot 46 onto an area of hard surface flooring (e.g., flooring area #1) by manually turning (i.e., rotating) the spigot handle 48 from a fully closed position to one or more desired open positions, and then back to a fully closed position. If desired, the user moves the cleaning apparatus 10 across the flooring area while dispensing cleaning liquid. The user dispenses some or all of the fresh cleaning liquid onto the flooring area, depending on the amount needed for the particular cleaning task. [0057] At 104, if desired, the user spreads and/or agitates the fresh cleaning liquid that has been dispensed (or is in the process of being dispensed) onto the flooring area - using a mop, brush, squeegee, or other handheld spreading device to do so. The spreading and/or agitation helps loosen soil from the flooring area and facilitates mixing of soil with dispensed cleaning liquid prior to vacuuming soil and dispensed cleaning liquid from the flooring area into the tank 18. [0058] At 106, the user turns on the vacuum motor assembly and vacuums soil and dispensed cleaning liquid from the flooring area into the tank interior space 36, thereby removing soil and recovering cleaning liquid for reuse. If the user did not dispense all of the fresh cleaning liquid at 102, the recovered cleaning liquid mixes with the remaining fresh cleaning liquid. [0059] At 108, the user dispenses a desired amount of recovered cleaning liquid through the spigot 46 onto another area of hard surface flooring (e.g., flooring area #2) by manually turning (i.e., rotating) the spigot handle 48 from a fully closed position to one or more desired open positions, and then back to a fully closed position. If desired, the user moves the cleaning apparatus 10 across the flooring area while dispensing cleaning liquid. The two areas may be adjacent or remote from one another. Also, the two areas may be in the same room or in different rooms. [0060] At 110, if desired, the user spreads and/or agitates the recovered cleaning liquid that has been dispensed (or is in the process of being dispensed) onto the other flooring area - using a mop, brush, squeegee, or other handheld spreading device to do so. [0061] At 112, the user then turns on the vacuum motor assembly and vacuums soil and dispensed cleaning liquid from the other flooring area into the tank interior space 36, thereby removing soil and recovering cleaning liquid for reuse. [0062] At 114, if there are one or more additional areas of hard surface flooring to be cleaned at this time, the user repeats steps 108, 110, and 112 at the additional area(s) (e.g., flooring area(s) #3 through #N (where N is an integer (e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc.)), until the cleaning liquid in the tank 18 becomes visibly soiled (or until the additional area(s) have been cleaned, if sooner). The additional area(s) may be adjacent or remote from one another and flooring areas #1 and #2. Also, the additional area(s) may be in the same room or in different rooms - with respect to each other and flooring areas #1 and #2. [0063] At 116, when the cleaning liquid in the tank 18 becomes visibly soiled - or if the cleaning liquid is not yet visibly soiled, but the cleaning apparatus 10 will not be used for an extended period of time - the user drains the cleaning liquid and soil from the tank interior space 36 into a suitable receptacle or drain via the dump outlet 80 and dump hose 82. If the optional bag filter assembly 70 was used, the user also removes the bag filter assembly, and empties and rinses off the bag filter 74. In addition, the user rinses out the tank 18. [0064] With reference to Fig. 15, another example of a method of cleaning hard surface flooring with the portable liquid-recycling liquid-reusing cleaning apparatus embodiment 10, in accordance with the principles of the invention, is shown. [0065] As shown at 200, a user fills the cleaning-liquid-dispensing-and-vacuum- recovery tank 18 with a fresh cleaning liquid - for example, water or another cleaning liquid or solution. If the cleaning apparatus 10 is not already on the area of hard surface flooring to be cleaned, the user moves (e.g., pushes or pulls) the cleaning apparatus to the desired location. [0066] At 202, the user dispenses fresh cleaning liquid onto two areas of hard surface flooring (e.g., flooring area #1 and flooring area #2). The two areas may be adjacent or remote from one another. Also, the two areas may be in the same room or in different rooms. At each area, the user dispenses an amount of fresh cleaning liquid through the spigot 46 onto the area by manually turning (i.e., rotating) the spigot handle 48 from a fully closed position to one or more desired open positions, and then back to a fully closed position. If desired, the user moves the cleaning apparatus 10 across the particular flooring area while dispensing cleaning liquid onto that flooring area. [0067] At 204, at one or both of the two areas, if desired the user spreads and/or agitates the fresh cleaning liquid that has been dispensed (or is in the process of being dispensed) onto these areas - using a mop, brush, squeegee, or other handheld spreading device to do so. The spreading and/or agitation helps loosen soil from the flooring area(s) and facilitates mixing of soil with dispensed cleaning liquid prior to vacuuming soil and dispensed cleaning liquid from the flooring area(s) into the tank 18. [0068] At 206, the user turns on the vacuum motor assembly and vacuums soil and dispensed cleaning liquid from the two areas of hard surface flooring (e.g., flooring area #1 and flooring area #2) into the tank interior space 36, thereby removing soil and recovering cleaning liquid for reuse. [0069] At 208, the user dispenses recovered cleaning liquid onto another area of hard surface flooring (e.g., flooring area #3). The user dispenses a desired amount of recovered cleaning liquid through the spigot 46 onto this area by manually turning (i.e., rotating) the spigot handle 48 from a fully closed position to one or more desired open positions, and then back to a fully closed position. If desired, the user moves the cleaning apparatus 10 across this area while dispensing cleaning liquid. This area (flooring area #3) may be adjacent or remote from either or both of the other two areas (flooring area #1 and flooring area #2). Also, this area may be in the same room as one or both of the other two areas, or it may be in a different room. [0070] At 210, if desired, the user spreads and/or agitates the recovered cleaning liquid that has been dispensed (or is in the process of being dispensed) onto this area (flooring area #3) - using a mop, brush, squeegee, or other handheld spreading device to do so. [0071] At 212, the user then turns on the vacuum motor assembly and vacuums soil and dispensed cleaning liquid from this area (flooring area #3) into the tank interior space 36, thereby removing soil and recovering cleaning liquid for reuse. [0072] At 214, if there are one or more additional areas of hard surface flooring to be cleaned at this time, the user repeats steps 208, 210, and 212 at the additional area(s) (e.g., flooring area(s) #4 through #N (where N is an integer (e.g., 0, 1, 2, etc.)), until the cleaning liquid in the tank 18 becomes visibly soiled (or until the additional area(s) have been cleaned, if sooner). The additional area(s) may be adjacent or remote from one another and flooring areas #1, #2, and #3. Also, the additional area(s) may be in the same room or in different rooms - with respect to each other and flooring areas #1, #2, and #3. [0073] At 216, when the cleaning liquid in the tank 18 becomes visibly soiled - or if the cleaning liquid is not yet visibly soiled, but the cleaning apparatus 10 will not be used for an extended period of time - the user drains the cleaning liquid and soil from the tank interior space 36 into a suitable receptacle or drain via the dump outlet 80 and dump hose 82. If the optional bag filter assembly 70 was used, the user also removes the bag filter assembly, and empties and rinses off the bag filter 74. In addition, the user rinses out the tank 18.
