DESCRIPTION Title of Invention: NOVEL IMIDAZOGXA2IMS C«OIMD OR SALT THEREOF Technical Field [0001] Tile present invention relates to a novel imidazooKasine compound or a salt thereof,, and a pharmaceutical composition containing the imidazooxatine compound or salt thereof as an active ingredient, and in particular, to an antitumor drug having ΜΤ kinase inhibitory action. Furthermore, the present invention relates to an ART inhibitor, a method for preventing or treating cancer, and a use of the imidasoox&sine compound, or salt thereof for the production of an antitumor drug, Background Art [0002] ART is a serine-threonine kinase identified as an oncogene in a mouse leukemia virus, and it has been revealed that its activity is important for various functions, such as cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, metastasis, and invasion (Non-patent Literature I and 2}. In human beings, three isoforms (AKTl/PRBsU, ΑΚΤ2/ΡΚΒβ, and ΑΚΤ3/ΡΚΒγ) have bean reported (Non-patent Literature 3 and 4}, Activation of ART involves localization to the plasma membrane by binding to PI 3 kinasegenerated phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, and phosphorylation by multiple kinases (Non-patent Literature 5), In many cancer's fe,g,, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, prostatic cancer, stomach cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, head and neck cancer, urinary tract cancer, and endometrial cancer), it has been reported that the expression of activated ART is enhanced by activation of FI3 kinase due to mutation, etc,, or inactivation of its negative regulator, PTEN (Non-patent .Literature 6), In addition, enhanced expression of activated ART has been reported to be associated with, poor prognosis in various cancers (e,g,, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer. prostatic cancer, stomach cancer, and endometrial cancer) (Non-patent Literature 7). [0003] Therefore, in cancers with enhanced activity of ΑΚΤ, a drug that specifically inhibits ΑΚΤ is expected to enable suppression of cancer cell proliferation, survival, metastasis, invasion, etc., by administration of the drug, and is anticipated as a new cancer treatment that will contribute to improvements in patient life-prolongation and QOL. In actual therapy, since PI3 kinase abnormality, PTEN abnormality, or ΑΚΤ activation serves as an index for stratification, patient selection based on the stratification becomes possible; thus, this is highly favorable from an ethical viewpoint.
