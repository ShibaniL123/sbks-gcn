The present invention relates to a color-changing composition in particular useful for care, hygiene and/or makeup of keratin materials. In particular, a color-changing composition according to the invention may be any type of cosmetic composition such as a foundation, a face powder, an eye shadow, a concealer product, a blusher, a lipstick, a lip balm, a lip gloss, a lip pencil, an eye pencil, an eyeliner, a mascara, a body makeup product, a skin colouring product, a care product such as a care cream, a ‘BB’ product (Blemish Balm product able to cover imperfections), a tinted cream or an antisun product, preferably a foundation or ‘BB’ product. The color-changing composition according to the invention may be liquid, solid or a powder. A composition of the invention is especially a composition intended to be applied to a keratin material, in particular the skin and more particularly facial skin, such as a skin care or make-up product for face. According to another embodiment, the composition of the invention is a mascara. According to another embodiment, the composition of the invention is a product for lips, in particular a lipgloss, a lipbalm or a lipstick. Cosmetic compositions, especially foundations, are commonly used to give the skin an aesthetic colour, but also to hide skin imperfections such as redness and/or marks. In this regard, many formulations have been developed to date. In this respect, there is a growing interest in cosmetic products that provide a change in color in response to external incentives such for example shear force. Generally, this purpose is achieved by including in cosmetic composition microencapsulated colorants wherein, upon application on the skin, the composition provides the expected changing color. More particularly, the change of color is provided by the colorant-containing microcapsules, which upon rupture by application of a mechanical force, release the entrapped colorant into the composition, thereby changing its color. A mechanical action such as rubbing spread the topical composition and facilitates its penetration into the skin. The immediate change of color of the composition provides a visual esthetical effect. Different types of entrapped colorants and more particularly pigments-containing microcapsules are already available. They mainly differ through the type of entrapping material(s) and/or the type of encapsulation. Thus, as pigments encapsulated by microcapsules in acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid polymers or copolymers, it may be cited for example microcapsules containing copolymer of ethyl acrylate/methacrylic acid ammonium salts, commercialized by the Tagra company and described in WO-A-01/35933. It may be also cited the encapsulated pigments commercialized by TAGRA BIOTECHNOLOGIES under the name BLACKCAP1©, YELLOWCAP1©, REDCAP1©, BLACKCAP3©, YELLOWCAP3©, REDCAP3©. As pigments encapsulated by microspheres in cellulose derivatives, it can be cited for example spheres comprising cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, commercialized by the Induchem company under the name Unisphere©. As pigments encapsulated by microcapsules in polymers of polyester, polyaminomethacrylate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, shellac types and mixtures thereof, it may be notably cited those described in the application US 2011/0165208 of Biogenics and commercialized under the name Magicolor© by Biogenics. As other pigments encapsulated by microcapsules may also be cited the ones disclosed by DAITO in JP2011-79804 may be also cited the pigment-encapsulated double-layer microcapsules comprising three or more of the following (a) mannitol, (b) hydrogenated lecithin, (c) polymethylmethacrylate, (d) cellulose and (e) shellac. These double-layer microcapsules do not comprise an uncoloured core as the one of the microcapsules preferably used according to the invention, but rather a colored inner layer containing the aforesaid components which are mixed all together and then granulated. However, with some colorant-containing microcapsules it may be difficult to permanently retain the colorant over long periods of time and when subjected to different environments and conditions. This is true of pigments, oil soluble dyes, and water soluble dyes. Thus, some microcapsules described in patents and publications have been found to gradually release the colorant, or to “bleed”, over time when tested for prolonged periods at elevated temperatures. Color bleed occurs when a dye or pigment migrates through or off of microspheres/microcapsules through contact with moisture and/or other ingredients in a formulation such as alcohols or glycols, surfactants, silicones, oils, preservatives, salts and other components typically found in cosmetic formulations. Leeching or bleed of the colorant in cosmetic composition can impair the long term visual effect of the cosmetic both in the container and on the substrate. Furthermore, some pigment-containing microcapsules may confer a lower coverage effect than expected. Furthermore, some pigment-containing microcapsules are immediately broken down at the time of application so, while there is the fun of a sudden colour change, it has not been possible to realise intermediate stages in this colour change or to adjust the colour gradation. Furthermore, some pigment-containing microcapsules may have some stability issues depending on the cosmetic composition and with associated solvents/ingredients, notably when the formulations containing the microcapsules are stocked in high temperature during few days or few months, for instance at a temperature greater or equal to 45° C. Said stability issues may trigger colorant releasing into the cosmetic composition. Furthermore, some pigment-containing microcapsules may have a grey color aspect that confers a not attractive color in the bulk of the cosmetic composition. At last, some microcapsules may provide a discomfort and/or unfavourable feeling when the cosmetic formulation including them is applied on a keratin material. Thus there is a need to provide cosmetic composition with colorant-containing microcapsules having improved color bleed resistance. In this respect, there is a need of colorant-containing microcapsules, which capsules retain good shatter resistance and exhibit improved bleed resistance. In a cosmetic composition if the dye is not permanently retained, this can impair the long-term visual effect of the cosmetic. There is also a need to provide a cosmetic composition which allows the preferred colouration or gradation pattern to be adjusted by varying the method or intensity of application onto the skin or the use of microcapsules containing different colorants. There is also a need to provide a cosmetic composition stable with a large panel of solvent/ingredient associated. There is also a need to provide a cosmetic composition wherein the microcapsules are or are not visible inside the bulk of the composition depending on the desired appearance. There is also a need for a cosmetic composition containing pigment-encapsulated microcapsules which do not provoke to the user a discomfort feeling when applied. Thus, according to one of its aspects, a subject of the invention is a color-changing composition for caring for and/or making up keratin materials comprising: a physiologically acceptable medium including at least an aqueous phase, color-changing microcapsules, said microcapsules having a size ranging from 50 μm to 1000 μm, preferably from 80 μm to 800 μm , in particular from 100 pm to 400 μm, and comprising: (A) a core, having preferably a size ranging from 20 μm to 800 μm, comprising at least one colorant and preferably at least one binder, said colorant(s) including preferably at least one inorganic pigment preferably selected from iron oxide(s), and (B) a pressure-breakable wall layer surrounding said core, having preferably a thickness of 10 μm to 300 μm, comprising at least one colorant and preferably at least one binder, said colorant(s) including preferably at least titanium dioxide particles, wherein said microcapsules includes at least 70% by weight of colorant(s), compared to the total weight of said microcapsules.

For the purposes of the present invention, the term “keratin material” is intended to cover the skin, mucous membranes such as the lips, the nails and the eyelashes. The skin and the lips, in particular facial skin, are most particularly considered according to the invention.

The present invention is also directed according to another object of invention to a process for caring for and/or making up keratinic materials, comprising application on said keratinic materials in particular on the skin of a composition according to the invention. As emerges from the examples that follow, compositions in accordance with the invention prove to be advantageous in several aspects. Encapsulation of the colorants prevents undesirable re-agglomeration of pigments during manufacture and prolonged storage of the cosmetic compositions. The microcapsules of the invention may have the ability of being more easily breakable in contact with aqueous phase, preferably in contact with hydrophilic agent(s) (ex: water, polyols, glycols, alcohols . . . ). The microcapsules may advantageously swell in contact of such hydrophilic agent(s) as defined hereunder. Said microcapsules are advantageously deformable when applied on a keratin material and consequently provide a soft feeling to the user. Furthermore, their low size contributes to not create any discomfort or unfavourable feeling when applied. However, the microcapsules of the invention are soft enough to rupture upon very slight rubbing or pressing on the skin in order to release their content but, nevertheless, are durable enough to avoid destruction of the coating during manufacture and storage of corresponding change-color composition. In addition, the microcapsule of the invention allows the use of regular equipment for the preparation of the compositions of the invention because no coloring of the apparatus occurs during the manufacturing process. Accordingly, the microcapsules of the present invention are particularly interesting since they mask the original color of the encapsulated colorants, increase the stability of these colorants against degradation, and prevent undesirable release of the encapsulated colorants into the composition during the manufacturing process and prolonged storage. At last, compositions of the invention also have the advantage of satisfying a consumer expectation in terms of cosmetic products. According to another of its aspects, a subject of the present invention is also directed to a cosmetic process comprising at least the steps consisting in applying at least part of a composition according to the invention on the surface of a keratin material, in particular the skin. According to the invention, the “color changing composition” means a composition wherein the color before application is different from the color after application, this difference being visible to the naked eyes. In particular, this color changing composition may be linked to a color-difference ΔE in CIE Lab system 1976 (ΔE before/after application) value. The ΔE is defined by the equation: Δ   E * = ( ( L 1 - L 2 ) 2 + ( a 1 - a 2 ) 2 + ( b 1 - b 2 ) 2 ⋮ wherein L1,a1,b1 are the parameters in the colorimetric space of the 1st color (composition before application) and L2,a2,b2 the ones for the 2nd color (composition after the application and homogenization on the keratinic material). These values may be measured by spectrophotometer or with a Chromasphere (for composition applied on skin). The color changing composition according to the invention may be characterized as having a ΔE before/after application superior to 1, in particular superior or equal to 2, preferably superior or equal to 3. Drawings intended to illustrate the invention in a non limitative way, representing examples of microcapsules to be introduced in cosmetic composition according to the invention will be described in the description which follows. FIG. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating a typical structure of color-changing microcapsule of the present invention, wherein A represent a coloured core, B, C, D and E being different layers concentrically surrounding said core A, at least one of these surrounding layers being mandatory including preferably titanium dioxide particles, the others being optional.

FIG. 3 represent a schematic diagram showing the core-shell structure of color-changing microcapsules comprising 2 layers: coloured core—TiO2 particles layer. COLORING MICROCAPSULES The term “microcapsule”, as used herein, refers to a spherical microcapsule containing at least one layered coating entrapping at least one colorant and surrounding a core chemically different from the coating. Microcapsules are distinct from microspheres, which consist of spherical homogeneous matrix. According to an embodiment, the “at least one layered coating” is a multi-layered coating. The term “multi-layer microcapsule” refers to a microcapsule consisting of an inner core (or core seed) surrounded by a coating based on one or more inner layer(s) and one outer layer. The one or more inner layer(s) forming the multi-layer coating of the multi-layer microcapsule and the single layer of the outer core microcapsule may be formed of the same or different compound(s). The microcapsule according to the invention comprises an inner core surrounded by a coating based on one or more inner layer(s) and one outer layer. In a preferred embodiment, the microcapsule is a ‘multi-layers’ microcapsule, comprising at least one inner layer and one outer layer. The one or more inner layer(s) forming the multi-layer coating of the multi-layer microcapsule and the single layer of the outer core microcapsule may be formed of the same or different compound(s). In one embodiment, the outer layer(s) does not comprise any colorant. In another embodiment, the outer layer(s) comprise(s) at least one colorant. The term “colorant” refers to organic pigments such as synthetic or natural dyes selected from any of the well known FD&C or D&C dyes, inorganic pigments such as metal oxides, or lakes and any combination (blend) thereof. Accordingly, the colorant useful according to the present invention may be oil-soluble or oil-dispersible or with limited solubility in water. The color-changing microcapsule preferably comprises: a core including at least one coloured core and eventually at least one inner color layer(s), and a shell having at least one pressure-breakable wall layer surrounding said core, an optional outer color layer and an optional outmost shell. In preferred embodiments, the microcapsules includes colorant(s) selected from inorganic pigment(s), preferably selected from metal oxide, such as iron oxides and titanium oxide. Preferably the coloured core includes at least one inorganic pigment advantageously selected from at least one metallic oxide, more advantageously selected from at least one iron oxide. Preferably the pressure-breakable wall layer includes at least one inorganic pigment advantageously selected from at least one metallic oxide, more advantageously selected from at least one titanium oxide. Preferably such iron oxides are located at least in the coloured core and titanium oxides are located at least in a pressure-breakable wall layer surrounding said core. The color-changing microcapsules according to the invention comprise at least 70% by weight of colorant(s), preferably of inorganic pigment(s), preferably of a mixture of inorganic pigments, preferably of metallic oxides such as iron oxides and titanium oxides, compared to the total weight of the color-changing microcapsules. Generally average particle size diameters of colorant microcapsules up to about 800 microns are used according to the invention. Preferably the average particle size diameter of the colorant microcapsules is less than about 400 microns for skin care applications. Advantageously the average particle size diameter is in the range of about 10 to 350 microns. Preferably, the average particle size will be from 50 μm to 800 μm, and in particular from 60 μm to 400 μm. Advantageously the color-changing microcapsule according to the present invention has a mean particle size of about from 18 to 270 mesh (around from 1000 μm to 53 μm), particularly about from 25 to 170 mesh (around from 710 μm to 90 μm). Preferably, a composition according to the invention may comprise from 0.1% to 20% by weight and preferably from 0.5% to 15% by weight of microcapsules relative to the total weight of the said composition. In particular for a skin care composition according to the invention, the amount of microcapsules will range from 0.1% to 5%, preferably from 0.2% to 3% by weight relative to the total weight of composition. In particular for a make-up composition according to the invention, the amount of microcapsules will range from 0.5% to 20%, preferably from 1% to 15%, more preferably from 2% to 10% by weight relative to the total weight of composition. According to a particular embodiment, the encapsulated colorant(s) may be present in a composition according to the invention in an amount in active matter of encapsulated pigments ranging from 0.5% to 20% by weight, in particular from 1% to 15% by weight, and more particularly from 2% to 12% by weight, of the total weight of said composition. They will be integrated in the cosmetic formula generally at the latest stages of the formulation and after filtering stages if any, to avoid broken. Preferably, the microcapsules according to the inventions are added and mixed uniformly at temperatures under 50° C. They are mixed gently with a paddle rather than an homogeneizer. The microcapsules may be produced by several methods known from the man skilled in the art within the coating or encapsulation domain, including pelletization, granulation, coating, etc . . . . As example, the microcapsules may be obtained by steps comprising mixture of the compounds (actives, pigments, polymers, solvents) and drying to form capsules as disclosed in WO01/35933 and WO2011/027960, or steps of granulation and coating by spray drying as disclosed in FR2841155, or by fluidized bed technology, which has been used in the food and pharmaceutical industry. As example may be cited WO08139053 for the preparation of spheroid multilayer comprising a core of sugar and concentric layers of pharmaceutical actives. Fixation of pharmaceutical actives on the core is made by impregnation or pulverization or projection, and then the 1st layer is dried before application of a second one. Preferably, microcapsules introduced in the cosmetic composition according to the invention are obtainable, and preferably obtained, at least in part, by fluidized bed technology which will be described later in this description. The specificity of the fluid bed process is that it leads to real capsules compared to spray drying, which leads to a matrix with the core material randomly dispersed in a polymer. According to a particular aspect of the invention, more than 60%, preferably more than 70%, particularly more than 80%, and more particularly more than 90% of color-changing microcapsules will be ruptured to release the inner colorant within 1 minute, preferably from 1 to 40 seconds, particularly from 1 to 30 seconds, more particularly from 1 to 20 seconds after pressing, rubbing, wiping and/or scrubbing with hand or an implement. However, said ratio and time-limit does not critical in the present invention. 1. Core In the present invention, the core of the microcapsule comprises a coloured core which comprises at least one colorant and advantageously at least one binder. The colorant(s) preferably includes at least one pigment, preferably selected from at least one iron oxide(s). The binder is preferably selected from at least one hydrophilic polymer, at least one lipid-based material, and their mixture, preferably their mixture. The core can be prepared in a form of particle, powder, granule, micro sphere, microcapsule, for example, by spray drying or fluid bed process of the solution comprising at least one colorant, at least one polymer as a wall-forming material and at least one lipid-based material in a solvent. The size of coloured core, and more generally of the core, is not particularly limited and may be suitably chosen according to the finally desired color-changing microcapsule. For example, the size of the coloured core, and more generally of the core, may be larger than 20 μm or more, particularly 30 μm or more, preferably 40 μm or more, more preferably 50 μm or more, and smaller than 800 μm or less, particularly 700 μm or less, preferably 600 μm or less, more preferably 500 μm or less. The radius of the core is larger than 50%, specifically 60%, preferably 70% and more preferably 80%, based on the total radius of the microcapsule. For example, the ratio between the radius of the core and the thickness of the shell is selected from 1:0.05 to 1:0.5. Alternatively, the content of the core is more than 30% by weight, specifically 40%, preferably 50% and more preferably 60%, based on the total weight of the microcapsule. Therefore, the microcapsule of the present invention has a high loading amount of colorant in a particle. The core can have one or more inner color layer(s) surrounding the coloured core. The inner color layer(s) may be every layers located between the coloured core and the pressure-breakable wall layer. The inner color layer(s) including, for example, first inner color layer, second inner color layer and third inner color layer, etc., wherein the colorants and binders contained in each inner color layers are the same or different from each other. In a preferred embodiment, the coloured core can comprise one or two inner color layers, preferably one inner color layers. When the core has a coloured core and an inner color layer, the coloured core can be formed by a granulation of a solution for the coloured core comprising at least one colorant and preferably at least one binder, an inner color layer can be formed by coating the coloured core with a solution for the inner color layer comprising at least one colorant and preferably at least one binder. Said coating process can be performed by a fluidized bed coating process. The thickness of an inner color layer is not particularly limited and may be suitably chosen according to the finally desired color-changing microcapsule. For example, the thickness of the coloured core, and more generally of the core, may be larger than 20 μm or more, particularly 40 μm or more, preferably 60 μm or more, more preferably 80 μm or more, and smaller than 200 μm or less, particularly 160 μm or less, preferably 120 μm or less, more preferably 100 μm or less. Alternatively, the content of an inner color layer may be from 20 to 80% by weight, specifically from 30 to 70% by weight, preferably from 40 to 60% by weight based on the total weight of core. In a particular embodiment, the coloured core does not contain a binder and is surrounded with an inner color layer comprising a colorant and a binder, by which pigments contained in the core will be more easily dispersed when the microcapsule is ruptured. In the coloured core, a binder can be used in an amount that colorant will not fall apart or separate from the layer during the coating process and/or after the removal of solvent, and generally can be used in an amount selected from from 1 to 30% by weight, preferably from 2 to 25% by weight, particularly from 5 to 20% by weight, and more particularly from 5 to 15% by weight in the terms of total weight of the coloured core. According to a preferred embodiment, the colorant(s), and preferably the pigment(s), still more preferably the iron oxide(s), is (are) present in the core in an amount of at least 70% by weight, specifically at least 75% by weight, preferably at least 80% by weight, more preferably at least 85% by weight, such as from 80 to 99% by weight, relative to the total weight of the relative to the total weight of the core. According to a preferred embodiment, the colorant(s), and preferably the pigment(s), still more preferably the iron oxide(s), is (are) present in an amount of at least 30% by weight, specifically at least 35% by weight, preferably at least 40% by weight, such as from 40 to 60% by weight, relative to the total weight of the microcapsule.

More preferably, the content of iron oxide(s) particles in the microcapsule is preferably selected from 30 to 58% by weight, preferably from 35 to 55% by weight, more preferably from 40 to 50% by weight, relative to the total weight of the microcapsule. 2. Pressure-Breakable Wall Layer or Titanium Dioxide Particle Layer The color-changing microcapsule of the present invention has a pressure-breakable wall layer or pressure-breakable including at least one colorant. Said colorant(s) is (are) preferably selected from inorganic pigment, more preferably from metallic oxide and still more preferably from titanium dioxide particle. Preferably the colorant contained into the pressure-breakable wall layer is distinct from the colorant(s) contained in the coloured core, for instance being both metallic oxides distinct from each other. According to a preferred embodiment, the titanium dioxide particles are preferably are discontinuously dispersed in the layer and linked to each other by a binder. In the context of the present invention, the term “pressure-breakable” or “pressure-friable” means that a rupture can be easily made by pressing, rubbing, wiping and/or scrubbing with hand or an implement such as cloths, sponge or paper. A pressure-breakable titanium dioxide particles layer can comprise particles of titanium dioxide and a binder, and said binder can comprise a wall-forming material. In the pressure-breakable wall layer of the present invention, it is believed that the titanium dioxide particles lodged in the wall-forming materials will break the pressure-breakable wall layer in an irreversible manner and facilitate or increase the disintegration or dissolution of said wall layer. Further, it is also estimated that titanium dioxide particles do an important role for the strength, the durability, the pressure-breakability, the after-feeling of the wall layer. For example, the pressure-breakable wall layer can be formed by the following procedure: (a) to dissolve or disperse titanium dioxide particles and a bind in an appropriate solvent to give a solution comprising titanium dioxide particles and a bind, (b) to coat particles having the inner color layer with the solution obtained at the above (a), and (c) optionally to dry the resulting particles obtained in the above (b). Said coating may be preformed by using the fluidized bed process, but other coating process can be utilized, if necessary. As to the appropriate solvents which can be utilized in the above procedure, mention can be made of water or a low boiling solvent such as methylene chloride, methanol and ethanol. The titanium dioxide particle layer, of which thickness can vary depending on the amount of titanium dioxide used and/or the type of binder, and may have a thickness of 10 μm or more, preferably 20 μm or more, more preferably 30 μm or more, particularly 40 μm or more, commonly 300 μm or less, preferably 250 μm or less, more preferably 200 μm or less, particularly 150 μm or less. The content of titanium dioxide particles in the pressure-breakable wall layer is preferably selected from 50 to 99% by weight, preferably from 60 to 98% by weight, more preferably from 70 to 97% by weight, particularly from 80 to 95% by weight, in terms of total weight of the pressure-breakable wall layer. Preferably the content of colorant(s), and in particular of titanium dioxide particles, represent less than 100% of the pressure-breakable wall layer. The content of titanium dioxide particles in the microcapsule is preferably selected from 20 to 60% by weight, preferably from 25 to 55% by weight, more preferably from 30 to 50% by weight, relative to the total weight of the microcapsule. The colorant(s) in the coloured core, preferably iron oxide(s), and the colorant(s) in the pressure-breakable wall layer, preferably titanium dioxide particles, are both present in a respective total amount in the microcapsules such as the weight ratio of the colorant(s) in the coloured core, and preferably iron oxide(s), relatively to colorant(s) in the pressure-breakable wall layer, preferably titanium dioxide particles, is greater than or equal to 1. The iron oxide(s) and the titanium dioxide particles are both present in a respective total amount in the microcapsules such as the weight ratio of the iron oxide(s) relatively to titanium dioxide particles is greater than or equal to 1. The mean diameter or size of titanium dioxide particles is not specifically limited but has a mean diameter of usually from 10 nm to 20 μm, preferably from 50 nm to 10 μm, more preferably from 100 nm to 5 μm, and particularly from 150 nm to 5 μm. The mean diameter or size of less than 10 nm of titanium dioxide particles may result to a decrease in the pressure-breakable ability, and the mean diameter of more than 20 μm may make difficult the formation of titanium dioxide particles layer. Titanium dioxide particles having a first particle size of less than the above range but having a second particle size falling down the above particle size range can be applicable in the present invention. 3. Outer Color Layer The color-changing microcapsule additionally comprises an optional outer color layer onto the pressure-breakable titanium dioxide particles layer. The outer color layer can be formed by coating the titanium dioxide particles layer with a solution having a colorant and a binder, for example, by the fluidized bed process. The colorant and binder used in the outer color layer can be the same or different from those used in the inner color layer. In general, the outer color layer is given to impart a visual color different from white color issued from the titanium dioxide particles layer and/or the color of inner color layer. Therefore, a colorant in the outer color layer can be used in an amount that does not disturb the color developed by the inner color layer when the microcapsules are scrubbed. The content of an outer color layer can be selected, in terms of the total weight of core, from 1 to 60 parts per weight, preferably from 2 to 50 parts per weight, more preferably from 3 to 40 parts per weight, particularly from 4 to 30 parts per weight. However, the content of a colorant in the outer color layer may be selected, in terms of total weight of colorants in the inner color layer, from 0.01 to 5 parts per weight, preferably from 0.05 to 4.5 parts per weight, more preferably from 0.1 to 4 parts per weight, particularly from 0.5 to 3.5 parts per weight. The content of a colorant in an outer color layer may be additionally increased if the color of the outer color layer would not disturb the color of the inner color layer. A person skilled in the art can choose the color and content of a colorant in an outer color layer in an appropriate manner by considering the color and content of colorants contained in inner color layers and the desired color to be finally developed. The thickness of an outer color layer is not particularly limited and may be suitably chosen according to the finally desired color-changing microcapsule. For example, the out color layer may have a thickness which is larger than 20 μm, particularly 40 μm, preferably 60 μm, more preferably 80 μm, and which is smaller than 200 μm, particularly 150 μm, preferably 120 μm, more preferably 100 μm. 4. Outmost Shell Microcapsule of the present invention can comprise a protective outmost shell onto a pressure-breakable titanium dioxide particles layer or an additional outer color layer to protect the microcapsule against water in the air during storage or to ensure a long period stability of the microcapsule in a carrier, notably in solution. The outmost shell can be made from at least one polymer, and preferably can be made from at least one polymer selected from the group consisting of polysaccharides and derivatives, acrylic or methacrylic acid homopolymers or copolymers or salts and esters thereof, polystyrene-maleic anhydride copolymer, and their mixture, such as poly(meth)acrylate, cellulose ether, cellulose ester and derivatives, and their mixture. The content of said outmost shell is selected, in terms of total weight of microcapsule, from 0.1 to 20.0% by weight and preferably from 0.5 to 15% by weight. When the content of the outmost shell is less than 0.1% by weight, the shell coating may be meaningless, and when it is more than 20.0% by weight, a feeling of foreign substances may be caused. The thickness of an outmost shell is not particularly limited and may be suitably chosen according to the finally desired color-changing microcapsule. For example, the outmost shell may have a thickness which is larger than 20 μm, particularly 30 μm, preferably 40 μm, more preferably 50 μm, and which is smaller than 200 μm, particularly 150 μm, preferably 120 μm, more preferably 90 μm. Other examples of polymers which could be implemented as outmost shell will be given later during the description of the binder which may be used in microcapsules according to the invention. 5. Colorant or Coloring Agent In the present invention, “colorant” include any synthetic or natural, or organic or inorganic pigments, dyes or lakes, and any colorants approved by CTFA and the FDA. In the present invention, the colorant may be water-soluble or water-dispersible, or oil-soluble or oil-dispersible or with limited solubility in water. Thus the term “colorant” refers to organic pigments such as synthetic or natural dyes selected from any of the well known FD&C or D&C dyes, inorganic pigments such as metal oxides, or lakes such as the ones based on cochineal carmine, barium, strontium, calcium or aluminum and any combination (blend) thereof. In the present invention, the following colorants can be mentioned: carmin of cochenille; organic pigments of azoïques, anthraquinoniques, indigoïdes, xantheniques, pyreniques, quinoliniques, de triphenylmethane, de fluorane colorants; les insoluble salts of sodium, potassium, calcium, baryum, aluminum, zirconium, strontium, titanium, of acid colorants such as azoïques, anthraquinoniques, indigoïdes, xantheniques, pyreniques, quinoliniques, de triphenylmethane, de fluorane colorants, these colorants may include at least one carboxylic or sulfonic acid group. As to particular examples of organic pigments, those having the following trade names can be mentioned: D&C Blue n° 4, D&C Brown n° 1, D&C Green n° 5, D&C Green n° 6, D&C Orange n° 4, D&C Orange n° 5, D&C Orange n° 10, D&C Orange n° 11, D&C Red n° 6, D&C Red n° 7, D&C Red n° 17, D&C Red n° 21, D&C Red n° 22, D&C Red n° 27, D&C Red n° 28, D&C Red n° 30, D&C Red n° 31, D&C Red n° 33, D&C Red n° 34, D&C Red n° 36, D&C Violet n° 2, D&C Yellow n° 7, D&C Yellow n° 8, D&C Yellow n° 10, D&C Yellow n° 11, FD&C Blue n° 1, FD&C Green n° 3, FD&C Red n° 40, FD&C Yellow n° 5, FD&C Yellow n° 6. In preferred embodiments, the colorants are essentially inorganic pigments, more preferably a mixture of metal oxide(s). Advantageously, the colorants of the multi-layer microcapsules are primary metal oxides selected from iron oxides, titanium dioxide, aluminum oxide, zirconium oxides, cobalt oxides, cerium oxides, nickel oxides, tin oxide or zinc oxide, or composite oxides, more preferably an iron oxide selected from red iron oxide, yellow iron oxide or black iron oxide, or a mixture thereof. A person skilled in the art knows how to choose colorants and combinations of colorants to produce a desired color effect or color change. In preferred embodiments, if white is the desired color to be developed by the color changing microcapsule, a white colorant such as titanium dioxide can be chosen as a colorant for inner color layer. In such case, the inner color layer may be substantially the same or similar to the titanium dioxide particles layer, and thus, it can be understood that a titanium dioxide particle layer can simultaneously plays both roles of an inner color layer and pressure-breakable wall layer. Meanwhile, a color may be achieved from one colorant alone, but most colors can be generally achieved from mixed colorants by changing the composition of colorants. Therefore, in the context of the present invention, the term “a (the) colorant” may cover both of “one colorant” and “a mixture of colorants”, if there is no specific restriction. Preferably coloured core and pressure-breakable wall layer are made at least in part of metallic oxides, preferably iron oxides for the core and titanium dioxide for the pressure-breakable wall. 6. Binder In general, it is difficult to form a coating layer by using only colorant component or particles without using any binder. Further, even if a coating layer without a binder is formed with difficulty, such coating layer may be easily damaged or ruptured or any components or particles may be easily removed from the coating layer. Therefore, a binder may be employed in order to proceed the coating process and to improve the durability of coating layer. Such a binder is selected from adhesive polymeric materials, which can act as wall-forming materials (wall-forming polymeric material). In the present invention, the binder is preferably selected from at least one wall-forming material, from a lipid-base material, and their mixture. More preferably, the binder is preferably a mixture which comprises both of a polymer as a wall-forming material and a lipid-base material as coating base. The coating base refers to a hydrophilic coating base, a hydrophobic coating base, or lipid-based coating base. Since the hydrophilic coating base may be extracted together with colorant and the hydrophobic coating base may give a feeling of foreign substances due to its tow strong film property, it is preferable to employ a lipid-base coating base. According to a particular embodiment of this invention, such lipid based material may have amphiphilic properties, that is to say having an apolar part and a polar part. Such lipid-based material can include at least one or several C12-C22 fatty acids chain such as selected from stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, etc and mixtures thereof. Preferably these fatty acids chains are hydrogenated. Eventually, these fatty acid chains may be the apolar part of a lipid-based material. Lipid-based materials are amphiphilic materials having both of a polar part and an apolar part in one molecule and includes, for example, a C12-C22 fatty acid chain selected from a group consisting of stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenoic acid, and mixture thereof. Said fatty acid chain may be hydrogenated, and optionally forms the apolar portion of the lipid-based materials. Said lipid-based materials can be selected form the group consisting of a phospolipid such as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid or phosphatidylserine, a sphingolipid such as sphingosine-1-phosphate or sphingomyelin and ceramide, preferably ceramide or recithin which is a phospholipid mixture, particularly hydrogenated recithin. The amount of lipid-based materials can be determined by considering the type and amount of wall-forming polymers as well as other components such as colorants and/or titanium dioxide particles. In general, however, the content of lipid-based materials can be selected, in terms of total weight of each layer, from 0.1 to 30% by weight, particularly from 0.2 to 25% by weight, preferably from 0.3 to 20% by weight and more preferably from 0.4 to 20% by weight. When the content of lipid-based materials is less than 0.1% by weight, the breakability or dissolution ability may be decreased, and when it is more than 25% by weight, the durability may be decreased or the stability during processing and storage may be decreased. In the present invention, the wall-forming polymer is selected from hydrophilic polymers. The term “hydrophilic polymers ” means a polymer which can form hydrogen bond with water or alcohol compounds (especially elected from lower alcohols, glycol and polyol), particularly those having O—H, N—H and S—H bonds in the molecule. Said hydrophilic polymer can be selected from the following polymers or mixture thereof: acrylic or methacrylic acid homopolymers or copolymers or salts and esters thereof and in particular the products sold under the names Versicol F or Versicol K by the company Allied Colloid, Ultrahold 8 by the company Ciba-Geigy, and polyacrylic acids of Synthalen K type, and salts, especially sodium salts, of polyacrylic acids (corresponding to the INCI name sodium acrylate copolymer) and more particularly a crosslinked sodium polyacrylate (corresponding to the INCI name sodium acrylate copolymer (and) caprylic/capric triglycerides) sold under the name Luvigel EM by the company; copolymers of acrylic acid and of acrylamide sold in the form of the sodium salt thereof under the names Reten by the company Hercules, the sodium polymethacrylate sold under the name Darvan No. 7 by the company Vanderbilt, and the sodium salts of polyhydroxycarboxylic acids sold under the name Hydagen F by the company Henkel; polyacrylic acid/alkyl acrylate copolymers, preferably modified or unmodified carboxyvinyl polymers; the copolymers most particularly preferred according to the present invention are acrylate/C10-C30-alkylacrylate copolymers (INCI name: Acrylates/C10-30 Alkylacrylate Cross polymer) such as the products sold by the company Lubrizol under the tradenames Pemulen TR1, Pemulen TR2, Carbopol 1382 and Carbopol ETD2020, and even more preferentially Pemulen TR-2; alkylacrylic/alkylmethacrylic acid copolymers and their derivatives notably their salts and their esters, such as the copolymer of ethyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate and low content of methacrylic acid ester with quaternary ammonium groups provided under the tradename of EUDRAGIT RSPO from Evonik Degussa; AMPS (polyacrylamidomethylpropanesulfonic acid partially neutralized with aqueous ammonia and highly crosslinked) sold by the company Clariant; AMPS/acrylamide copolymers such as the products Sepigel or Simulgel sold by the company SEPPIC, especially a copolymer of INCI name Polyacrylamide (and) C13-14 Isoparaffin (and) Laureth-7; polyoxyethylenated AMPS/alkyl methacrylate copolymers (crosslinked or non-crosslinked) of the type such as Aristoflex HMS sold by the company Clariant; anionic, cationic, amphoteric or nonionic chitin or chitosan polymers; cellulose polymers and derivatives, preferably other than alkylcellulose, chosen from hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxymethylcellulose, ethylhydroxyethylcellulose and carboxymethylcellulose, and also quaternized cellulose derivatives; in a preferred embodiment, the cellulose polymers is a carboxymethylcellulose; Starch polymers and derivatives, eventually modified; in a preferred embodiment, the starch polymer is a natural starch; vinyl polymers, for instance polyvinylpyrrolidones, copolymers of methyl vinyl ether and of malic anhydride, the copolymer of vinyl acetate and of crotonic acid, copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone and of vinyl acetate; copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone and of caprolactam; polyvinyl alcohol; optionally modified polymers of natural origin, such as galactomannans and derivatives thereof, such as konjac gum, gellan gum, locust bean gum, fenugreek gum, karaya gum, gum tragacanth, gum arabic, acacia gum, guar gum, hydroxypropyl guar, hydroxypropyl guar modified with sodium methylcarboxylate groups (Jaguar XC97-1, Rhodia), hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium guar chloride, and xanthan derivatives; alginates and carrageenans; glycoaminoglycans, hyaluronic acid and derivatives thereof; mucopolysaccharides such as hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfates, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the hydrophilic polymers according to the invention can be selected from the group consisting of polysaccharides and its derivatives, homopolymers or copolymers of acrylic or methacrylic acid or salts and esters thereof, and their mixture. Said polysaccharides and derivatives can be selected from chitosan polymers, chitin polymers, cellulose polymers, starch polymers, galactomannans, alginates, carrageenans, mucopolysaccharides, and their derivatives, and the mixture thereof. Said polysaccharides and derivatives is (are) preferably selected from the group consisting of starch polymers. In one preferred embodiment, the hydrophilic polymers can be selected from the group consisting of corn starch, polymethyl methacrylate, cellulose or its dertivatives such as carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), cellulose ester and ether and aminocellulose, and mixture thereof. In one preferred embodiment, the hydrophilic polymers can be selected from the group consisting of corn starch, polymethyl methacrylate, their derivatives, and mixture thereof. Preferred homo- and/or co-polymer of methacrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid ester are those wherein the copolymer of methyl methacrylate and ethyl acrylate has a molecule weight from 750 to 850 kDa. The hydrophilic polymer(s) used as a wall-forming material in the present invention are not cross-linked. The amount of polymers or wall-forming polymers can be determined by considering the type and amount of colorants, titanium dioxide particles and/or lipid-based materials. In general, however, the content of polymers or wall-forming polymers in each layer can be selected, in terms of total weight of each layer, from 0.1 to 30% by weight, particularly from 0.2 to 25% by weight, preferably from 0.3 to 20% by weight and more preferably from 0.4 to 20% by weight. When the content of lipid-based materials is less than 0.1% by weight, the breakability or dissolution ability may be decreased, and when it is more than 25% by weight, the durability may be decreased or the stability during processing and storage may be decreased. Such hydrophilic polymers described in this part may be implemented both as shell-forming polymer and as a binder. 7. Fluidized-Bed Coating Process The microcapsules implemented in the cosmetic composition according to the present invention are preferentially at least in part prepared by a fluid-bed process, especially a fluidized-bed coating process. The specificity of the fluid-bed process is that it leads to real capsules compared to spray drying, which leads to granular particles by particle cohesion or to a matrix with the core material randomly dispersed in a polymer. In particular the use of fluid-bed process allows having substantially spherical microcapsules with an core substantially spherical, surrounded by at least one layer circumferentially surrounding said core and preferably at least one outer layer circumferentially surrounding said inner layer. Fluid bed process is disclosed by example in ‘Fluid-Bed Coating, Teunou, E.; Poncelet, 2005, D. Food Science and Technology (BocaRaton, Fla., United States), Volume 146 Issue Encapsulated and Powdered Foods, Pages 197-212. A man skilled in the art knows how to adjust air quantity, liquid quantity and temperature allowing reproducing a microcapsule according to the invention. Preferably a fluid bed process implemented includes Würster process and/or tangential spray process. Such process allows, contrary to pelletization process, to conduct to spherical capsules with core surrounded by one or more circumferential layers. By combining two or more compounds (ex: polymers, lipid-based material) with titanium dioxide particles in the microcapsule of different hardness and/or water solubility, it is possible to adjust the time required for colorant-encapsulated microcapsules to break down on the skin so that, by varying the method or intensity of application onto the skin, it is possible to adjust the preferred colouration or gradation pattern. Thus, according to a preferred embodiment, the multi-layers coating contains at least starch as polymer with at least one lipid-based material and preferably lecithin. According to a preferred embodiment, the microcapsules additionally includes lipid-based material chosen from phospholipids, advantageously selected from phosphoacylglycerol and in particular lecithins. According to a preferred embodiment, the microcapsules include at least three or more different colorants (in terms of color). In preferred embodiments, said colorants are inorganic pigments, more preferably metal oxide(s). In the present invention, an organic solvent may be employed in the preparation of coating solution used in the fluidized bed coating process. The organic solvent which can be used in the present invention is not specifically restricted but preferably includes methylene chloride, methanol, ethanol, and mixture thereof. It is possible to employ any organic solvent if it can dissolve or disperse the polymers and/or lipid-based materials, has a boiling point less than that water, and has a low residual toxicity. The microcapsules according to the invention are obtainable, and preferably obtained, by the following steps: (a-1) preparing particles of a coloured core (A-1) comprising at least one colorant and at least one binder, and (a-2) optionally coating the coloured core prepared in the above step (a-1) with a solution in which a colorant and a binder that are the same with or different from those used in the above step (a-1) are dissolved or dispersed to form an inner color layer (A-2); (b) coating the particles prepared in the above step (a-1) or (a-2) with a solution in which titanium dioxide particles and a binder to form a pressure-breakable wall layer (B); (c-1) optionally coating the particles obtained in the above step (b) with a solution in which a colorant and a binder that are the same with or different from those used in the above steps (a-1) or (a-2) are dissolved or dispersed to form an outer color layer (C-1), (c-2) optionally coating the particles obtained in the above step (b) or (c-1) with a solution in which a shell-forming polymer is dissolved or dispersed to form an outmost shell. Preferably such (a) binder(s) comprise(s) is selected from a polymer, a lipid-based material, and their mixture. Said polymer and a lipid-based material may be the same or different from each other. In one preferred embodiment, each coating in the steps (a-2), (b), (c-1) and (c-2) can be performed by the fluidized bed process. In one preferred embodiment, the layer surrounding the coloured core is made by fluidized bed coating process. In a preferred embodiment, every layers surrounding the coloured core are made by fluidized bed coating process. In a preferred embodiment, the outmost shell surrounding the layer(s) is made by fluidized bed coating process. In one preferred embodiment, said solution in the above steps can employs as a solvent such as water or organic solvents having a low-boiling point, for example, at least one selected from a group consisting of methylene chloride, methanol and ethanol. The present invention will be further explained by the examples, but is not restricted by them. EXAMPLE 1 To a mixed solution of methylene chloride and ethanol (weight ratio=1:1), hydrogenated lecithin and corn starch are added and completely dissolved at 40° C. To the resulting reaction mixture, a colorant mixture of iron oxide yellow, iron oxide red and iron oxide black are added and well dispersed with a homogenizer to prepare an inner color layer coating solution. Mixed colorant particles are introduced into a fluidized bed coating system (Glatt GPOG 1) and subjected to a coating with the inner color coating solution to obtain a coloured core particle coated with an inner color layer. Thereafter, to a mixed solution of methylene chloride and ethanol (weight ration=1:1), hydrogenated lecithin, PMMA (Polymethyl methacrylate) and corn starch binder are added and dissolved at 40° C. To the resulting reaction mixture, particular titanium dioxide is added and well dispersed with a homogenizer to prepare a titanium dioxide particle coating solution. A coating of the coloured core particle coated with an inner color layer with the resulting titanium dioxide particle coating solution is carried out by a fluidized bed process to obtain particles having a coloured core—an inner color layer—titanium dioxide particle layer.

Cosmetic Medium and Additional Ingredients The composition according to the invention is cosmetically acceptable that is it contains a physiologically acceptable medium which is non toxic and appropriate to be applied on the keratin material of human beings. “Cosmetically acceptable” in the sense of the present invention means a composition with pleasant appearance, odor or feeling. The “physiologically acceptable medium” is generally adapted to the form of under which the composition is intended to be conditioned. Particularly the nature and the amount of the ingredients are adapted for example depending on whether the composition is formulated as a solid, a fluid or a powder. Depending upon the form and the aim of the skin care or make-up preparation, the composition of the invention will comprise, in addition to the microcapsules containing colorant, further additional cosmetic ingredient(s) such as the ones selected from volatile and non-volatile silicon or hydrocarbon oils, surfactants, fillers, gelifying agents, thickening agents, film forming agents, polymers, preservatives, silicone elastomere, self-tanning agents, additional non-entrapped colorants, actives, UV filters and mixtures thereof. It is a matter of routine operations for a person skilled in the art to adjust the nature and amount of the additives present in the compositions in accordance with the invention such that the desired cosmetic properties thereof are not thereby affected. Some of these conventional ingredients are detailed here-after. Aqueuous Phase The microcapsules of the invention need to be in contact with an aqueous phase. Such an aqueous phase includes water and/or at least one water soluble solvent(s) (i.e. hydrophilic compound(s)), preferably water and at least one water soluble solvent(s).

The term “water-soluble solvent” denotes a compound that is liquid at room temperature and preferably water-miscible (miscibility with water of greater than 50% by weight at 25° C. and atmospheric pressure). The water-soluble solvents that may be used in the composition of the invention may also be volatile. The water-soluble solvents are preferably chosen from compounds comprising at least one —OH function. Preferably the water-soluble solvents are selected from C2-C8 monoalcohols, glycols, C3 and C4 ketones, C2-C4 aldehydes, sorbitol and polyols, and their mixture, preferably from glycols and polyols, and their mixture.

According to the invention, it is also possible to use a silicone polymer formed from a copolymer comprising several different units of formula (I), i.e. a polymer in which at least one of the groups R4, R5, R6, R7, X, G, Y, m and n is different in one of the units. The copolymer may also be formed from several units of formula (II), in which at least one of the groups R4, R6, R10, R11, m1 and m2 is different in at least one of the units. It is also possible to use a polymer comprising at least one unit of formula (I) and at least one unit of formula (II), the units of formula (I) and the units of formula (II) possibly being identical to or different from each other. These copolymers may be block polymers or grafted polymers. In this first embodiment of the invention, the silicone polymer may also consist of a grafted copolymer. Thus, the polyamide containing silicone units may be grafted and optionally crosslinked with silicone chains containing amide groups. Such polymers may be synthesized with trifunctional amines. According to one advantageous embodiment of the invention, the groups capable of establishing hydrogen interactions are amide groups of formulae —C(O)NH— and —HN—C(O)—. In this case, the structuring agent may be a polymer comprising at least one unit of formula (III) or (IV): in which R4, R5, R6, R7, X, Y, m and n are as defined above.

As has been seen previously, the polymer may comprise identical or different units of formula (III) or (IV).

In this formula, the units may be structured to form either a block copolymer, or a random copolymer or an alternating copolymer. In this copolymer, the units may be not only of different lengths, but also of different chemical structures, for example containing different groups Y. In this case, the polymer may correspond to formula VI: in which R4 to R7, X, Y, m1, m2, n and p have the meanings given above and Y1 is different from Y but chosen from the groups defined for Y. As previously, the various units may be structured to form either a block copolymer, or a random copolymer or an alternating copolymer. In this first embodiment of the invention, the structuring agent may also consist of a grafted copolymer. Thus, the polyamide containing silicone units may be grafted and optionally crosslinked with silicone chains containing amide groups. Such polymers may be synthesized with trifunctional amines. In this case, the polymer may comprise at least one unit of formula (VII): in which X1 and X2, which are identical or different, have the meaning given for X in formula (I), n is as defined in formula (I), Y and T are as defined in formula (I), R14 to R21 are groups chosen from the same group as R4 to R7, m1 and m2 are numbers in the range from 1 to 1000, and p is an integer ranging from 2 to 500.

These polyamides containing a grafted silicone unit of formula (VII) may be copolymerized with polyamide-silicones of formula (II) to form block copolymers, alternating copolymers or random copolymers. The weight percentage of grafted silicone units (VII) in the copolymer may range from 0.5% to 30% by weight. According to the invention, as has been seen previously, the siloxane units may be in the main chain or backbone of the polymer, but they may also be present in grafted or pendent chains. In the main chain, the siloxane units may be in the form of segments as described above. In the pendent or grafted chains, the siloxane units may appear individually or in segments. According to one embodiment variant of the invention, a copolymer of silicone polyamide and of hydrocarbon-based polyamide, or a copolymer comprising units of formula (III) or (IV) and hydrocarbon-based polyamide units, may be used. In this case, the polyamide-silicone units may be located at the ends of the hydrocarbon-based polyamide. According to one preferred embodiment, the silicone polyamide comprises units of formula III, preferably in which the groups R4, R5, R6 and R7 represent methyl groups, one from among X and Y represents an alkylene group of 6 carbon atoms and the other represents an alkylene group of 11 carbon atoms, n representing the degree of polymerization DP of the polymer.

Preferably, nylon-611/dimethicone is used as silicone polyamide and a trimethyl siloxysilicate resin is used as silicone resin. According to another embodiment, the silicone resins are propylphenylsilsesquioxane resins. Silsesquioxane resins are a specific form of film forming silicone resins. Silicone resins are crosslinked organopolysiloxanes which are solid at room temperature and generally soluble in organic solvents. When they are soluble in volatile solvents, silicone resins are capable of forming a film once the solvent has evaporated. Furthermore, if the solvent dissolving the silicone resin is absorbed on the substrate onto which it is applied, the silicone resin which remains on the substrate may also form a film. The compositions of the present invention may comprise propylphenylsilsesquioxane resins, which have been disclosed in patent publications WO2005/090444, published on Sep. 29, 2005; US20040180011, published on Sep. 16, 2004; and US20040156806, published on Aug. 12, 2004. The propylphenylsilsesquioxane resin comprises at least about 70 mole % of propyl siloxy units (C3H7SiO3/2), based on the total mole % siloxy units of the resin, and at most about 30 mole % of phenyl siloxy units (C6H5SiO3/2), based on the total mole % siloxy units of the resin. The mole % of propyl siloxy units to phenyl siloxy units can be adjusted depending on an intended application. As such, it is possible to have propylphenylsilsesquioxane resins having a mole % propyl siloxy units:phenyl siloxy units ranging from about 70:30 to about 100:0, such as 70:30; 80:20; 90:10; and 100:0; and subranges therebetween. When the mole % of the propyl siloxy units is about 100 mole %, the propylphenylsilsesquioxane resin is referred to as a propylsilsesquioxane resin. A suitable example of a propylphenylsilsesquioxane resin for use in cosmetic compositions of the present invention includes, but is not limited to, a propylsilsesquioxane resin commercially available from Dow-Corning under the tradename DC 670 Fluid. The propylphenylsilsesquioxane film forming resin may be present in an amount ranging from about 0.5% to about 50% by weight, such as from about 1% to about 40% by weight, such as from about 2% to about 30% by weight, such as from about 3% to about 20% by weight, and such as from about 4% to about 10% by weight, all weights based on the weight of the composition as a whole. Silicone Acrylate Copolymers The composition of the present invention may contain silicone acrylate copolymers. Silicone acrylate copolymers are another specific form of film forming silicone resins. They are available as silicone acrylate copolymers with a (meth)acrylate backbone grafted with a silicone chain or as a silicone backbone grafted with a (meth)acrylate, or as a silicone acrylate dendrimer. Silicone acrylate dendrimers, such as those described and claimed in U.S. Pat.

It is characterized by a vinyl-type polymer which has in its side molecular chain a carbosiloxane dendrimer structure. The term “carbosiloxane dendrimer structure” is a structure with high-molecular-weight groups branched with high regularity in a radial direction from a single core. The vinyl polymer backbone is formed from a vinyl-type monomer which contains a radical polymerizable vinyl group. In its broadest definition, there are no particular limitations with regards to the type of such a monomer. A particularly preferred vinyl polymer is a (meth)acrylate. The number-average molecular weight of the silicone acrylate dendrimers for use in the composition of the present invention ranges from about 3,000 to about 2,000,000, such as from about 5,000 to about 800,000.

These gelling agents may be present in an amount ranging for example from 0.001 to 10% by weight, preferably 0.01 to 5% by weight and more preferably from 0.05 to 3% by weight relative to the total weight of said composition. According to a specific embodiment, the aqueous phase of the composition contains at least one neutralized 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid polymers and copolymers and one polysaccharide biopolymer. More preferably the aqueous gel is transparent. The expression “transparent aqueous medium” means a medium allowing light to pass without causing deviation by refraction or reflection.

The portable Turbidimeter 2100P® Model from HACH company may be used, for example, for measuring the ranges of transparency of the composition. The composition is considered to be transparent when the measured value of turbidity is between 0 and 250 NTU and is considered as a translucent for a value of turbidity from 250 to 1000 NTU. The transparent compositions, when placed in front of a 0.01 m thick black line with diameter of 2 mm drawn on a white sheet, reveal this black line, as opposed to an opaque composition that is to say, not transparent which would not allow it.

These features help to deliver both skincare efficacy perception (watery, moisturization and transparent) as well as make-up efficacy (proper coverage). Advantageously, a transparent gel contains a swelling agent, this agent allows a better swelling of the microcapsules thus rendering the microcapsules easier to break during application. Water, alcohols, glycols polyols may be used as swelling agent. Examples of swelling agents are disclosed above. The moisturization may further be enhanced by introduction of one or more water soluble emollient(s) and/or lipid(s) with a polar moiety.

A transparent gel could also by slightly colored. In this case, a transparent gel comprises at least one non-entrapped colorant, preferably in an amount of less than 1% by weight based on the total weight of the total composition. The composition may also be in a form of an gelly cream, or emulsionated gel, comprising oils and surfactants. According to another embodiment, the changing color composition according to the invention is in the form of a foam comprising from 1 to 30% by weight relative to the weight of the composition of microcapsules. The term “composition in (the) foam form” and the term “foam type formulation” mean the same thing and are understood to mean a composition comprising a gas phase (for example air) in the form of bubbles; another equivalent term is “composition expanded in volume”. In one embodiment, a foam composition is obtained without any propellant (non aerosol foam). In another preferred embodiment, a foam composition is obtained with a propellant (aerosol foam) The composition in the foam form according to the invention may be obtained from a composition of the invention used as “base composition” packaged in a product. This product may contain, besides the base composition, a propellant. Thus, the present invention further relates to a product comprising: a. a container defining at least one compartment;b. a composition of the invention contained in said compartment,c. a propellant to pressurize said composition inside said compartment; andd. a dispensing head having an opening to be selectively put in fluid communication with said compartment in order to deliver said pressurized composition in the form of a foam. According to yet another embodiment, the present invention relates to a kit comprising one of the product defined above and an applicator. The compositions in the foam form according to the invention are formed stably in the form of mousse using a composition of the invention and air or an inert gas. The air or the inert gas may represent especially from 10% to 500% and preferably from 20% to 200%, for example from 30% to 100% of the volume of the composition in the foam form. This volume may be calculated by comparing the density of the base composition and of the in the foam form composition. Besides air, gases that allow the composition in the foam form to be obtained are in particular inert gases, for example nitrogen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, noble gases or a mixture of the said gases. When the composition comprises an oxidation-sensitive compound, it is preferable to use an oxygen-free gas such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide. The amount of gas introduced into the base composition contributes towards adjusting the density of the composition in the foam form to the desired value, for example less than or equal to 0.12 g/cm3. The composition in the foam form of the invention may have for example a density of less than or equal to 0.12 g/cm3, for example ranging from 0.02 to 0.11 g/cm3 and preferably from 0.06 to 0.10 g/cm3, this density being measured at a temperature of about 20° C. and at atmospheric pressure according to the following protocol. Density Measurement The test is performed on 50 ml of composition introduced into a 50 ml polished Plexiglas® goblet (V1) defining a cylindrical filling space 30 mm high having a base with a diameter of 46 mm. The goblet has a bottom wall 10 mm thick and a side wall 12 mm thick. Before measurement, the composition to be characterized and the goblet are maintained at a temperature of about 20° C. The goblet is tared and the weight value (M1) is recorded. The composition in the foam form is then introduced into the goblet so as to occupy the total volume, while avoiding the formation of air bubbles during the filling of the goblet. The assembly is left to stand for 10 seconds to allow the mousse to expand fully. The top of the goblet is then skimmed before weighing (M2). The density is assessed according to the convention ρ=(M2−M1)/50. Stability Measurement The composition in the foam form according to the invention shows satisfactory stability, which may be calculated by measuring the volume of mousse (V2) remaining in the goblet after 10 minutes according to the protocol described above for the density measurement. The ratio V2/V1 corresponds to the ratio between the volume of the composition in the foam form after 10 minutes and the volume of the composition in the foam form after 10 seconds. The expression “satisfactory stability” applies especially to compositions in the foam form with a ratio V 2 V 1 of greater than 0.85 and especially greater than 0.90, for example greater than 0.95. For a given weight of composition in the foam form, the volume of the composition in the foam form is inversely proportional to the density of the composition in the foam form. Thus, the ratio between the density of the composition in the foam form measured after 10 seconds and the density of the composition in the foam form measured after 10 minutes may be greater than 0.85 and especially greater than 0.90, for example greater than 0.95. Within the composition in the foam form according to the invention, the air pause may advantageously have a number-average size ranging from 20 μm to 500 μm and preferably ranging from 100 μm to 300 μm. The composition in the foam form may be obtained from a composition of the invention in a distributor. This distributor may be an aerosol containing, besides the base composition, a propellant. This propellant may represent less than 20% by weight of the base composition and in particular may represent from 1% to 10% by weight, for example from 2 to 8% by weight, for example at least 5% by weight of the total weight of the base composition. The propellant that may be used may be chosen from carbon dioxide, nitrogen, nitrous oxide and volatile hydrocarbons such as butane, isobutane, propane, ethane, pentane, isododecane or isohexadecane, and mixtures thereof. It may especially be a propane/butane mixture (Liquified Petroleum Gas or LPG) in a weight ratio [propane/butane] ranging from 0.1 to 1, especially of 0.31. The pressure of the propellant, and for example of said propane/butane mixture, in the aerosol may range from 0.20 to 0.50 MPa, for example from 0.20 to 0.40, and especially from 0.25 to 0.35 MPa. The compositions in the foam form employed in the invention can be prepared by processes for mixing, stirring or dispersing compressed gases, such as air, chlorofluorocarbon-based compounds, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, oxygen or helium, a process for mixing and stirring in the presence of a foaming agent, such as a surfactant. In particular, the composition in the foam form is prepared by mixing the ingredients with stirring, generally under hot conditions, and by then expanding in volume under the action of a gas, it being possible for the gas to be introduced during the stage of cooling the composition or after preparation of the composition, for example using a device for expanding in volume of Mondomix type, a beater of Kenwood type, a scraped-surface exchanger or a dynamic mixer (of IMT type, for example). The gas is preferably air or nitrogen. The composition according to the invention can be packaged in a container delimiting at least one compartment which comprises the composition, the container being closed by a closure part. The container can be equipped with a means for the dispensing of the product. In particular, the container can be equipped with a pump. The container can be a pot. The container can be at least partly made of thermoplastic. Mention may be made, as examples of thermoplastics, of polypropylene or polyethylene. Alternatively, the container is made of nonthermoplastic material, in particular of glass or metal (or alloy). The composition can be applied, e.g., by finger or using an applicator. The container is preferably used in combination with an applicator comprising at least one application component configured in order to apply the composition to keratinous substances. According to another advantageous embodiment, the applicator comprises an application nozzle. The foam composition according to the invention comprises from 1 to 30%, preferably from 3 to 10% by weight relative to the weight of the composition of microcapsules. The obtained foam is fine (small bubbles) and contains colored microcapsules. The said foam has a white aspect before application on keratinic materials and a colored aspect after application and homogeneization on the keratinic materials, in particular skin. When the foam composition comprises at least 3% by weight relative to the weight of the composition of microcapsules, it preferably comprises fillers and/or pigments, such as TiO2, ZnO, CeO, Bismuth Oxichloride, Boron Nitrite, advantageously TiO2. The foam composition may also comprise calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in order to avoid coloration of the water phase. The foam composition according to the invention comprises from 1 to 10%, preferably from 3 to 8% by weight relative to the weight of the composition of fillers and/or pigments advantageously TiO2. The foam composition according to the invention comprises from 0.5 to 5%, preferably from 1 to 3% by weight relative to the weight of the composition of calcium carbonate. In order to test the stability of the foams, they have been vigourously shaken (1000 shakes) the ΔE a,b between the color of the bulk before shaking and after shaking is less than 10, preferably less than 5. According to another embodiment, the changing color composition according to the invention is an oil in water (O/W) emulsion. This make up composition, which is preferably a makeup BB product for face or a foundation, provides very strong moisturizing sensation, creamy texture with very comfortable feeling during application, and sheer natural makeup result after application. After application, all these features help to deliver a very good balance of skincare efficacy perception (creamy and moisturization) as well as makeup efficacy (proper coverage and natural radiance). Advantageously, an appropriate sunscreen agent may be added. This composition mainly comprises water, at least one non-volatile oil at least one O/W emulsifier and microcapsules. The non-volatile oil(s) used in this preferred embodiment are the ones previously cited. Advantageously the O/W emulsion contains a swelling agent, this agent allow a better swelling of the microcapsules thus rendering the microcapsules easier to break during application. Water, alcohols, glycols, polyols may be used as swelling agent. Preferably the O/W emulsion also contains a co-emulsifier and/or a solubilizer. Cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol may be cited as co-emulsifiers. The solubilizer may be added in order to keep the properties of the O/W emulsion on storage, in particular to solubilize the ingredients of the water phase, to make and keep the composition stable in shelf lives. Polysorbate 20, PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil may be mentioned as examples of solubilizers. An O/W emulsion with perfect stable capsules in storage, with pigments releasing during application without any particle feeling is obtained. Makeup results are perfectly and evenly provided after application. Moreover O/W emulsion may contain at least one of the following swelling agent, water such as deionized water, preferably in a concentration from 0 to 90% wgt, more preferably from 30 to 70% wgt, alcohols preferably in a concentration from 0 to 50% wgt, more preferably from 1 to 20% wgt, glycols such as propylene glycol, butylenes glycol, preferably in a concentration from 0 to 50% wgt, more preferably from 1 to 15% wgt, polyols such as glycerin, tetraols, preferably in a concentration from 0 to 50% wgt, more preferably from 1 to 10% wgt, co-emulsifier such as cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol, at high temp. above 60° C.) preferably in a concentration from 0 to 20% wgt, more preferably from 1 to 5% wgt and solubilizer such as PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil in a concentration from 0 to 10% wgt, more preferably from 1 to 5% wgt. Otherwise, the O/W emulsion may contain at least two different types of microcapsules for example three different types of microcapsules. Thus the makeup results may be modified into natural and radiant look, further delivering a kind of look of white pinkish makeup with even skin tone. Microcapsules could be introduced at last step with gentle stirring but without side scrapper after emulsion is made. O/W emulsion can be obtained with pure and clean appearance of bulk, with perfect stability under −20/20° C. (5 cycle), room temperature (25° C., 2 months), 37° C. (2 months) and 45° C. (2 months).
