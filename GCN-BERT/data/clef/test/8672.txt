BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Metal ions such as stannous (Sn2+) and zinc ions are known to be effective anti-microbial agents. These metal ions provide anti-gingivitis and anti-plaque benefits and may also improve breath and reduce sensitivity. Stannous fluoride (SnF2) has been used in dentistry since the 1950's as a fluoride source to prevent dental caries. However, it has been observed that aqueous solutions of stannous fluoride tend to precipitate water-insoluble stannic oxide (SnO2) upon aging. After a storage time of several months, such solutions may exhibit turbidity, which is believed to be due to the presence of very small crystals of stannic oxide dispersed in the solution, and the solutions may even form a sediment of stannic oxide at the bottom of the storage container. The precipitation of water-insoluble stannic oxide reduces the availability and therefore the therapeutic efficacy of the stannous ions in the oral care composition. It is believed that the precipitated water-insoluble stannic oxide has negligible or even no direct therapeutic effect. The inclusion of chelating agents in aqueous solutions of stannous fluoride has been found to reduce the formation of this turbidity to some extent, but is also believed to impair the efficacy of the stannous ions. Therefore, a need still exists for oral care compositions in which the bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy of the tin ions (stannous/stannic ions) is preserved, and which compositions do not exhibit turbidity upon aging.

Container In the present invention, the container has an inner surface, wherein the inner surface is at least partially formed from any of the linear polymers as described above. In some embodiments, the container is a bottle, a tube, a vial, a cartridge, a pump-action dispensing container. In some embodiments, the inner surface of the container is entirely formed from any of the linear polymers as described above. In some embodiments, the container is entirely formed from any of the linear polymers as described above. In some embodiments, the inner surface has a smoothness adapted so as not to form a precipitation or crystallisation site for SnO2. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that mouthrinse solutions containing stannous ions in the Sn(II) oxidation state (such as in stannous fluoride, SnF2) are prone to oxidation from the lower Sn(II) oxidation state to the higher Sn(IV) oxidation state. It is believed that the tin as Sn(IV) can be present as partly water-soluble Sn4+-hydroxo complexes (e.g. simplified as Sn(OH)4 or, in a more complicated formulation as [Sn(OH)6]2−—SnF22+), or as water-insoluble and therefore dispersed and/or precipitated stannic oxide, SnO2. Again without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that, although the therapeutic effect of Sn2+ ions dissolved in aqueous solution is significantly higher than the therapeutic effect of the water-soluble Sn(IV) complexes (such as the Sn(OH)4 and [Sn(OH)6]2−—SnF22+ complexes), the water-soluble Sn(IV) complexes still have a useful therapeutic effect in such solutions. However, it is believed that the precipitated water-insoluble stannic oxide SnO2 has little or no direct therapeutic effect. The present inventors have surprisingly found that the use of the linear polymers as defined above as a primary container material for aqueous compositions comprising at least one water-soluble source of Sn2+ ions (such as, for example, SnF2) prevents the precipitation of water-insoluble SnO2 (thought to be formed from water-soluble Sn(OH)4), thus the composition remains clear after oxidation of Sn(II) to Sn(IV) upon aging. However, the standard polyethylene terephthalate (PET) container material is not able to prevent the formation of insoluble stannic oxide, and stannic oxide precipitation is clearly observed when such compositions are packaged in standard polyethylene terephthalate (PET) containers. The present inventors have observed that, when Sn2+-containing compositions are packaged in a container formed from polypropylene, a higher concentration of the oxidised Sn4+ can be maintained in solution than when the compositions are packaged in container formed from polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and the solutions packaged in polypropylene containers do not show the turbidity (believed to be caused by precipitation of insoluble SnO2) which is observed when such solutions are packaged in PET containers. The present inventors observed that small polypropylene bottles containing 10 mL test samples of meridol® solution in which the Sn(II) was completely oxidised to Sn(IV) did not show any turbidity (caused by precipitation of insoluble SnO2) after a storage time of several years. The concentration of soluble Sn(IV) measured after centrifugation after a storage time of 3 years was 396 ppm, i.e. close to target of 400 ppm, therefore no SnO2 was precipitated. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is believed that this phenomenon may be explained by essential chemical differences between the PET container material and the polypropylene container material. The structures of polypropylene and PET are shown below: The polypropylene container material has an overall low polarity, which is thought to be caused by the relatively low electronegativity of the constituent atoms of the polymer, and also by the simple linear structure of the polymer. In contrast, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) comprises aliphatic and aromatic structures together with polar ester groups, and has a higher polarity than that of polypropylene. Again without wishing to be bound by any theory, the higher electronegativity of the constituent atoms of PET is thought to be sufficient to enhance the crystallisation process of insoluble stannic oxide (SnO2) on the polymer surface after a certain induction time, therefore resulting in turbid solutions. It is thought that the more polar PET material allows for the formation of small crystals of stannic oxide, which then propagate a precipitation of larger amounts of stannic oxide (for example as Cassiterite) after a longer storage time. It is also thought that other polymers with a similar linear structure to that of polypropylene could also be used in the present invention e.g. polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, polyacrylonitrile. Without wishing to be bound by any theory, it is also thought that the roughness of the polymer surface may also contribute to this effect or to the rate of precipitation of SnO2 from the water-soluble Sn(IV) complex Sn(OH)4. Deposition of SnO2 occurs on the rough polymer surface. This may favour a further and continuous precipitation of stannic oxide (SnO2). A smooth polymer surface has a much smaller surface area than that of a rough surface. There is therefore much less interaction between dissolved species and a smooth surface than between dissolved species and a rough surface. Therefore, the precipitation of stannic oxide (SnO2) is reduced when the surface is smooth as opposed to rough. Evidence for the contribution of surface roughness of the polymer material is also shown in the Examples, below. EXAMPLES Contribution of Surface Roughness A commercially available mouthrinse (“Mouthrinse”) concentrate containing 12,000 ppm Sn(II) was diluted with water in the ratio Mouthrinse concentrate:water of 1:30. This diluted solution was filled into six polypropylene sample bottles of each about 12 mL volume. After the dilution of the Mouthrinse with water at the ratio of 1:30, the concentration of Sn(II) in each sample was 400 ppm. Seven strips of identical polypropylene bottle material were added to each of these six sample bottles. The strips of material were scratched and roughened using scissors before insertion into the polypropylene bottles. The effect of the manual scratching with the scissors was clearly visible. It was thought that a rough surface might act as a possible trigger for introduction and acceleration of micro- or nano-crystallisation of water-insoluble SnO2. As a control, the Mouthrinse concentrate diluted as described above was added to six polypropylene sample bottles of each about 12 mL volume, but no roughened polypropylene strips were added to these samples. It was thought that these solutions might remain clear or significantly less turbid due to a reduction in or absence of precipitated SnO2. The samples were closed with a polyethylene foil, but with full contact to air in order to promote the oxidation of Sn(II) and the precipitation process of stannic oxide (SnO2) with the effect of increasing turbidity of the solution. The samples were closed with the foil only to prevent any spill or some loss of liquid during the test of 15 days. This closing was deliberately not done as an air-tight seal, as the presence of air during the test was necessary to promote the oxidation of Sn(II). It was thought that the samples with roughened strips might show insoluble precipitated SnO2, whereas the samples without roughened strips might form water-soluble Sn(IV) oxides with no SnO2 precipitation i.e. clear solutions. The solutions were studied after a time of 15 days, using the measurement of the colour values L*, a*, b* as a suitable measure for the turbidity. L*a*b*-values are international values for colour measurement. The CIE-Lab (Commission Internationale de l'eclairage) colour system is based on these three parameters: L* (brightness), a* (red-green), b* (yellow-blue). The brightness L* also provides a measure of turbidity or opalescence, because of scattering the incident light-beam. Among these colour values, it is mainly the L*-factor which is correlated to the turbidity of a solution, because of the scattering of the incident light by the dispersed stannic oxide particles during the measurement. This light-scattering decreases the L*-value by a diffuse light-reflection. During the storage time of 15 days, the samples with the solution were in full contact with oxygen in the air (as the samples were not closed so as to be air-tight, as discussed above). After the 15 days, the solutions from each of the six sample bottles which had seven strips of roughened polypropylene bottle material inserted therein were carefully poured into suitable measuring cups for performance of L*a*b* measurements. The solutions from each of the above six sample bottles which did not have roughened strips of polypropylene bottle material inserted therein were also poured into suitable measuring cups for the performance of L*a*b* measurements. The L*a*b* values of each of these two series of six samples were measured. It was hypothesised that there may be a significant difference in the L*-value (which is known to be sensitive for turbidity or for opalescence) for the samples of these two series. The L* value was measured nine times for each of the six solutions into which the strips of roughened polypropylene bottle material were inserted. For the six solutions into which no polypropylene strips were inserted, two of these solutions had their L* values measured nine times; two had their L* values measured eight times; and two had their L* values measured seven times. The mean L* values for each of the separate samples were then calculated, and are shown in Table 1, below: TABLE 1 Sample with Sample without roughened roughened polypropylene strips mean L* polypropylene strips mean L* 1 33.453 1 36.5414 2 35.056 2 38.8686 3 31.816 3 35.1513 4 33.196 4 34.6900 5 35.044 5 32.1056 6 34.980 6 36.0522 Overall mean L* 33.924 Overall mean L* 35.568 STDEV 1.330 STDEV 2.236 CV % 3.92 CV % 6.29 t-Test: 0.15 F-test: 0.28 In the data in Table 1, above, the small difference in L* (AL*=1.644 units) shows, in the statistical t-test, a probability of error of about 15% (or a statistical certainty of 85%) because of the low number of degrees of freedom (6+6−2=10). The statistical t-test is also known as Student's-t-test, and is a statistical procedure comparing the mean values and the standard deviations together with the total degree of freedom (the total degree of freedom being the sum of the number of measurement of the first mean-value, e.g. n1, and the number of measurement of the second mean-value n2). The above data shows, by the L* values of the samples with the scratched, roughened strips being smaller than the L* values of the samples without scratched, roughened strips, that there is a trend towards a somewhat higher turbidity of the samples which were in contact with the roughened surfaces as compared to those samples which were not in contact with a roughened surface.
