Example 15: Preparation of (2S,5R)-2-(3,9-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-7-ylcarbamoyl)-7-oxo-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yl hydrogen sulfate (Compound 15)
(1) Preparation of ethyl 4-((4-methoxybenzyl)-(3-ethoxycarbonyl-allyl)amino)but-2-enoate
4-Methoxybenzylamine (29.8 g, 217.2 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (1 L), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (84.25 g, 651.6 mmol) was added, ethyl 4-bromocrotonate (75%, 122.96 g, 477.84 mmol) was slowly added, heated to 40°C by using oil-bath, reacted for 16h. After completion of the reaction as measured by TLC (petroleum ether : ethyl acetate =5:1), the reaction solution was concentrated in vacuum, water (500 mL) was added, extracted with ethyl acetate (500 mL×2), the organic phases were combined and concentrated in vacuum, the crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether : ethyl acetate =10:1) to obtain the title compound (76 g, yield 96.8%).
