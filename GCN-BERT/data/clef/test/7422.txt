A magnetically stirred mixture of 4-chloro-1H-imidazole (15.0 g, 146 mmol), 1,2-difluoro-4-nitrobenzene (30 g, 189 mmol), and K2CO3 (20.22 g, 146 mmol) in DMSO (50 mL) was heated at 80Â° C. for 4 h. The resulting dark black solution was allowed to cool to RT. The reaction contents was poured into 800 mL water and vigorously stirred for 15 min. An orange preceipitate immediately crashed out and was collected to give 4-chloro-1-(2-fluoro-4-nitro-phenyl)-1H-imidazole (34.6 g, 98%).
