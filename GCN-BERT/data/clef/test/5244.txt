CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to and any benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/738,491, filed Dec. 18, 2012, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD The disclosure relates to a nutritional composition for use in a method of reducing stress in an individual in need thereof. More particularly, the nutritional composition comprises at least one human milk oligosaccharide selected from 6′-sialyllactose, lacto-N-neotetraose, lacto-N-tetraose, disialylated lacto-N-tetraose, 3′-fucosyllactose, and 3′-sialyllactose. BACKGROUND Infants, children, and adults are often exposed to psychological stress such as changes in social situation (e.g., changes in daycare provider or schools, new family additions, divorce, loss of loved ones, change in career, or job loss). When the stress is extreme, extended exposure may lead to counter-adaptive physiological and behavioral responses such as: anxiety or distress, heightened sensitivity to painful stimuli, depression, and impaired neuronal development or neuronal functioning. Traditional medicine has focused on treating severe symptoms of stress, like depression and anxiety, with pharmaceutical agents such as selective serotonin uptake inhibitors, but these therapies are not suitable for mitigating the effects of milder forms of stress as these compounds can lead to a number of undesirable side-effects. Even more importantly, pharmaceutical interventions may not be appropriate for use in infants and children due to potential side effects on neuronal development. For these reasons, there is a need for non-pharmaceutical interventions that treat, minimize the negative effects of stress, or serve as an adjunctive therapy to pharmaceutical therapeutic agents. The human gut microbiome exists in symbiosis with its host and it can exert a profound effect on health and disease (Nicholson, 2012). This complex microbial community plays a crucial role in harvesting energy from undigested carbohydrates, promoting maturation of the host immune system, and providing colonization resistance against potential pathogens (Clemente et al., 2012). However, under some conditions, the gut microbiome can also negatively impact human health. Undesirable alterations in the composition of gut microbiota are associated with the development of allergies, Celiac disease, gastric cancer, autism, obesity, anorexia, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and type 2 diabetes (Clemente et al., 2012). Although a growing body of evidence suggests that the composition of the intestinal microbiota alters neuronal development and behavior (Diaz Heijtz et al., 2011), little is known about the relationship between diet, the gut microbiota, and the central and peripheral nervous system. Thus far, it has been shown in animal models that oral administration of certain probiotic bacteria can alter brain lipid composition (Wall et al., 2012), sensitivity to gut pain (Kamiya et al., 2006; Duncker et al., 2011; McKernan et al., 2010), and anxiety-like behavior (Desbonnet et al., 2008). Yet, virtually nothing is known about the interaction between non-digestible dietary carbohydrates, such as human milk oligosaccharides, the intestinal microbiota, and neuronal development and function.

Both γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and agmatine help to reduce stress, anxiety, and hypersensitivity to painful stimuli, and improve mood, relaxation, and calmness. GABA is thought to relieve anxiety, improve mood, reduce symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, treat attention deficit disorder, increase lean muscle mass, promote fat-burning, stabilize blood pressure, and relieve pain, through its action as a primary inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. Animal studies indicate that agmatine is a putative neurotransmitter that exhibits antinociceptive, antidepressive, anxiolytic, and neuroprotective properties. Both of these compounds can be absorbed from food or endogenously produced by host cells. It has been found that GABA and agmatine can be produced in the gut of a human with the already present intestinal flora by feeding particular human milk oligosaccharides (HMO). As shown in tables 1 and 2 and carried out as described in Example 51, anaerobic fermentation cultures of fecal samples taken from either breast-fed infants (BF) or formula-fed infants (FF) and incubated with either lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT) or 6′-sialyllactose (6′SL) HMOs showed dramatic increases in GABA and agmatine relative to a blank. This in vitro study shows that the consumption of selected HMOs will produce GABA and agmatine in vivo by the human's own intestinal flora.

The present disclosure provides a nutritional composition comprising at least one human milk oligosaccharide selected from 6′-sialyllactose, lacto-N-neotetraose, lacto-N-tetraose, disialylated lacto-N-tetraose, 3′-fucosyllactose, and 3′-sialyllactose, for use in a method of reducing stress in an individual in need thereof. Without being bound to a particular theory, it is believed that feeding an individual a nutritional composition comprising at least one of 6′-sialyllactose, lacto-N-neotetraose, lacto-N-tetraose, disialylated lacto-N-tetraose, 3′-fucosyllactose, or 3′-sialyllactose, will result in the intestinal flora consuming these compounds and producing a large increase of GABA, agmatine, or both. The GABA, agmatine, or both will be absorbed through the gut of the individual into their blood stream and then pass through the blood-brain barrier. The GABA, agmatine, or both will then reduce the stress in an individual. Alternatively, the GABA, agmatine, or both may not be required to pass through the blood-brain barrier to have the desirable effect. Specific non-limiting examples of HMOs that may be included individually or in combination in the compositions used in the method of the present disclosure include: 6′-sialyllactose, lacto-N-neotetraose, lacto-N-tetraose, disialylated lacto-N-tetraose, 3′-fucosyllactose, or 3′-sialyllactose.

Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOs) Human milk oligosaccharides are one of the main components of human breast milk, which contains, on average, 10 grams per liter of neutral oligosaccharides and 1 gram per liter of acidic oligosaccharides. The composition of human milk oligosaccharides is very complex and more than 200 different oligosaccharide-like structures are known. The HMOs may be included in the nutritional compositions alone, or in some embodiments, in combination with other immune enhancing factors (e.g., long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, antioxidants, nucleotides, etc.). The HMO or HMOs may be isolated or enriched from milk(s) secreted by mammals including, but not limited to: human, bovine, ovine, porcine, or caprine species. The HMOs may also be produced via microbial fermentation, enzymatic processes, chemical synthesis, or combinations thereof.

Long Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (LCPUFAs) In addition to the HMOs described above, the nutritional composition may include LCPUFAs. LCPUFAs are included in the nutritional compositions to provide nutritional support, as well as to reduce oxidative stress and enhance growth and functional development of the intestinal epithelium and associated immune cell populations. In some embodiments, the nutritional composition includes a combination of one or more HMOs and one or more LCPUFAs such that the composition provides a synergistic benefit to the end user, such as a synergistic benefit in modulating anti-viral immune responses and dampening inflammation. In some embodiments, the HMO or HMOs used in combination with the LCPUFAs to provide the synergistic effect are acidic HMOs. Exemplary LCPUFAs for use in the nutritional compositions include, for example, ω-3 LCPUFAs and ω-6 LCPUFAs. Specific LCPUFAs include docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), arachidonic acid (ARA), linoleic acid, linolenic acid (alpha linolenic acid) and gamma-linolenic acid derived from oil sources such as plant oils, marine plankton, fungal oils, and fish oils. In one particular embodiment, the LCPUFAs are derived from fish oils such as menhaden, salmon, anchovy, cod, halibut, tuna, or herring oil. Particularly preferred LCPUFAs for use in the nutritional compositions with the HMOs include DHA, ARA, EPA, DPA, and combinations thereof. To reduce potential side effects of high dosages of LCPUFAs in the nutritional compositions, the content of LCPUFAs preferably does not exceed 3% by weight of the total fat content, including below 2% by weight of the total fat content, and including below 1% by weight of the total fat content in the nutritional composition.

Methods of Manufacture The nutritional compositions used in the methods of the present disclosure may be prepared by any known or otherwise effective manufacturing technique for preparing the selected product solid or liquid form. Many such techniques are known for any given product form such as nutritional liquids, powders, and nutritional bars, and can easily be applied by one of ordinary skill in the art to the nutritional compositions described herein. The nutritional compositions used in the methods of the present disclosure can therefore be prepared by any of a variety of known or otherwise effective formulation or manufacturing methods. In one suitable manufacturing process, for example, at least three separate slurries are prepared, including a protein-in-fat (PIF) slurry, a carbohydrate-mineral (CHO-MIN) slurry, and a protein-in-water (PIW) slurry. The PIF slurry is formed by heating and mixing the oil (e.g., canola oil, corn oil, etc.) and then adding an emulsifier (e.g., lecithin), fat soluble vitamins, and a portion of the total protein (e.g., milk protein concentrate, etc.) with continued heat and agitation. The CHO-MIN slurry is formed by adding with heated agitation to water: minerals (e.g., potassium citrate, dipotassium phosphate, sodium citrate, etc.), trace and ultra trace minerals (TM/UTM premix), thickening or suspending agents (e.g. avicel, gellan, carrageenan). The resulting CHO-MIN slurry is held for 10 minutes with continued heat and agitation before adding additional minerals (e.g., potassium chloride, magnesium carbonate, potassium iodide, etc.), and/or carbohydrates (e.g., HMOs, fructooligosaccharide, sucrose, corn syrup, etc.). The PIW slurry is then formed by mixing with heat and agitation the remaining protein, if any. The resulting slurries are then blended together with heated agitation and the pH adjusted to 6.6-7.0, after which the composition is subjected to high-temperature short-time (HTST) processing during which the composition is heat treated, emulsified and homogenized, and then allowed to cool. Water soluble vitamins and ascorbic acid are added, the pH is adjusted to the desired range if necessary, flavors are added, and water is added to achieve the desired total solid level. The composition is then aseptically packaged to form an aseptically packaged nutritional emulsion. This emulsion can then be further diluted, heat-treated, and packaged to form a ready-to-feed or concentrated liquid, or it can be heat-treated and subsequently processed and packaged as a reconstitutable powder, e.g., spray dried, drymixed, agglomerated. The nutritional solid, such as a spray dried nutritional powder or drymixed nutritional powder, may be prepared by any collection of known or otherwise effective technique, suitable for making and formulating a nutritional powder. For example, when the nutritional powder is a spray dried nutritional powder, the spray drying step may likewise include any spray drying technique that is known for or otherwise suitable for use in the production of nutritional powders. Many different spray drying methods and techniques are known for use in the nutrition field, all of which are suitable for use in the manufacture of the spray dried nutritional powders herein. One method of preparing the spray dried nutritional powder comprises forming and homogenizing an aqueous slurry or liquid comprising predigested fat, and optionally protein, carbohydrate, and other sources of fat, and then spray drying the slurry or liquid to produce a spray dried nutritional powder. The method may further comprise the step of spray drying, drymixing, or otherwise adding additional nutritional ingredients, including any one or more of the ingredients described herein, to the spray dried nutritional powder. The nutritional composition may be in the form of a bar. In one suitable manufacturing process, for example, the safflower oil, lecithin, glycerin, water, and flavors are added to a mixer. The dry powder ingredients and the vitamin mineral premix is added to the mixer and mixed for 1 minute. Corn syrup (heated to 95-105° F.) is added to the mixer and mixed for 2 minutes. Soy crisps and marshmallow bits are added to the mixer and mixed for 2 minutes. Chilled chocolate drops are added to the mixer and mixed for 1 minute. The mixture is formed into bars. A coating (preheated to 95-100° F.) is applied. Many different ingredients and mixing procedures may be used to make a nutritional bar. Other suitable methods for making nutritional products are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,365,218 (Borschel et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 6,589,576 (Borschel et al.), U.S. Pat. No. 6,306,908 (Carlson et al.), U.S. Patent Application 20030118703 A1 (Nguyen et al.), which descriptions are incorporated herein by reference to the extent that they are consistent herewith.

Generally, the 22-24 kcal/fl oz formulas are more commonly used in preterm or low birth weight infants, and the 20-21 kcal/fl oz (675-680 to 700 kcal/liter) formulas are more often used in term infants. In some embodiments, the emulsion may have a caloric density of from about 50-100 kcal/liter to about 660 kcal/liter, including from about 150 kcal/liter to about 500 kcal/liter. In some specific embodiments, the emulsion may have a caloric density of 25, or 50, or 75, or 100 kcal/liter. The nutritional emulsion may have a pH ranging from about 3.5 to about 8, but are most advantageously in a range of from about 4.5 to about 7.5, including from about 5.5 to about 7.3, including from about 6.2 to about 7.2. Although the serving size for the nutritional emulsion can vary depending upon a number of variables, a typical serving size is generally at least 1 mL, or even at least 2 mL, or even at least 5 mL, or even at least 10 mL, or even at least 25 mL, including ranges from 1 mL to about 300 mL, including from about 4 mL to about 250 mL, and including from about 10 mL to about 240 mL. Nutritional Solids The nutritional solids may be in any solid form but are typically in the form of flowable or substantially flowable particulate compositions, or at least particulate compositions. Particularly suitable nutritional solid product forms include spray dried, agglomerated and/or dryblended powder compositions. The compositions can easily be scooped and measured with a spoon or similar other device, and can easily be reconstituted by the intended user with a suitable aqueous liquid, typically water, to form a nutritional composition for immediate oral or enteral use. In this context, “immediate” use generally means within about 48 hours, most typically within about 24 hours, preferably right after reconstitution. The nutritional powders may be reconstituted with water prior to use to a caloric density tailored to the nutritional needs of the ultimate user, although in most instances the powders are reconstituted with water to form compositions comprising at least 19 kcal/fl oz (660 kcal/liter), more typically from about 20 kcal/fl oz (675-680 kcal/liter) to about 25 kcal/fl oz (820 kcal/liter), even more typically from about 20 kcal/fl oz (675-680 kcal/liter) to about 24 kcal/fl oz (800-810 kcal/liter). Generally, the 22-24 kcal/fl oz formulas are more commonly used in preterm or low birth weight infants, and the 20-21 kcal/fl oz (675-680 to 700 kcal/liter) formulas are more often used in term infants. In some embodiments, the reconstituted powder may have a caloric density of from about 50-100 kcal/liter to about 660 kcal/liter, including from about 150 kcal/liter to about 500 kcal/liter. In some specific embodiments, the emulsion may have a caloric density of 25, or 50, or 75, or 100 kcal/liter.

Supernatants from the fermentation cultures were sampled at 0 hr, 3 hr, and 6 hr. A culture without addition of HMOs served as a control. A sample of the fermentation medium (blank), which constituted approximately 90% of the starting culture volume, was also analyzed. Samples were extracted and split into equal parts for analysis on GC/MS and LC/MS/MS platforms. GABA and agmatine ions were identified in chromatograms, and peak area was integrated for quantitative analysis. The resulting data in tables 1 and 2 shows the relative ratios of GABA and agmatine compared to the blank for both breast fed and formula fed infants.
