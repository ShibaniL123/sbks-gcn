CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/955,608, filed Mar. 19, 2014, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND 1. Field Embodiments described herein generally relate to catalytic gasification of coal. More specifically, embodiments described herein relate to coal gasification with an FeCO3 catalyst. 2. Description of the Related Art Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) of coal offers the advantages of higher efficiency and capability of CO2 and pollutant separation compared to conventional coal-fired power plants. One important step in IGCC is coal gasification, which occurs within an energy-intensive high temperature environment. Therefore, the power generation industry and other natural resource industries are increasingly interested in using catalysts to improve coal gasification. Various catalysts for use in coal gasification have been investigated, but many are often cost prohibitive on an industrial scale. Iron compounds are potential gasification catalysts due to their abundance, low cost, and environmentally friendliness. Iron compounds have been previously investigated to catalyze coal gasification and their effects on coal pyrolysis and char gasification as well as tar formation during the whole coal gasification process. Ohtsuka et al. used X-ray diffraction (XRD) to investigate the effect of three iron compounds on coal pyrolysis. When using FeCl3 as the iron precursor, Ohtsuka et al. reported the presence of both metallic a-Fe and FeO (wustite) when devolatilization was conducted in an inert atmosphere, and existence of Fe3O4 (magnetite) when devolatilization was performed within a steam environment. The effect of Fe2(SO4)3 was also studied and similar results were obtained, except for the appearance of FeS peaks within both inert and steam devolatilization environments. When Fe(NO3)3 was employed as the iron precursor in an inert atmosphere, a-Fe (crystal size <30 nm) and Fe3C were detected, while a combination of small crystallites (<10 nm) of Fe3O4 with FeO were found when steam was used for devolatilization. In addition, Ohtsuka et al. found that Fe(NO3)3, transformed into fine particles of mixed iron oxides during devolatilization, was effective for steam gasification while chloride and the sulfate, converted to magnetite with a large crystallite size, were not effective. Alternatively, Song and Kim reported that Fe(NO3)3 was less active than FeSO4 during pyrolysis of a sub-bituminous coal with the same iron loading (3 wt %) at 700-800° C. Yu et al. loaded iron onto a brown coal using FeCl3 solution and obtained metallic α and γ Fe in the pyrolysis step and magnetite during gasification. Domazetis et al. reported that the char formed during pyrolysis of brown coal with added iron contained iron oxides and carbonates, as measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Coal tar is one of the byproducts formed during coal gasification. Tromp et al., using gas-chromatography (GC) and gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), identified that the volatile compounds from a pyrolysis process included varying amounts of polycyclic hydrocarbons. Zeng et al. studied the tar and the soot generated by tar's secondary reactions, using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of the dissolved samples in tetrahydrofuran (THF), also found that the tar molecules were typically poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) substituted with functional groups or heteroatoms, such as alkyl chains, oxygen, nitrogen, etc. Iron containing materials have also been tested for their effects on tar formation during coal gasification. Cypres and Soudan-Moinet found that iron oxides (Fe2O3 or Fe3O4) reduced both the primary devolatilization rate of coal (between 300° C. and 600° C.) and the tar and gaseous hydrocarbon yields, while the composition of the investigated tar did not change. Cypres and Soudan-Moinet also found that hematite iron had a greater influence than magnetite iron. Moreover, limonite (FeO(OH).nH2O) of various origins, iron oxides (FeO, Fe204, Fe3O4, and Fe2O3), ankerite (CaFe(CO3)2), sintered iron ore, and pelletized iron ore were evaluated by Nordgreen et al. and concluded that metallic iron from pre-reduced hematite (Fe2O3) was an effective catalyst and achieved almost 100% tar decomposition at 900° C. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effect of iron catalysts on the gasification of carbonaceous materials, including coal. Matsuoka et al. studied steam reforming of woody biomass in a fluidized bed at 500-700° C. with an Fe/γ-alumina catalyst and suggested that redox reactions take place on the iron oxide surface. Yu et al., Hermann and Huttinger, and Xu et al. indicated that the overall reactions with non-catalyzed steam carbon gasification occur on carbon particles and they are relatively simple, while those with iron-based steam gasification mainly proceed on the surface of iron species and much more complicated. As described above, iron-based catalysts may be advantageous in coal gasification processes. However, certain iron salts may be cost prohibitive on an industrial scale. In addition, SO42−, NO3− and Cl− moieties may damage gasification equipment and also harm the environment. Moreover, H2, CO, and CO2 yields may be less than desirable depending on the catalyst utilized. Thus, what is needed in the art are improved coal gasification catalysts and methods of utilizing catalysts in coal gasification processes to improve conversion and minimize deleterious effects of by-products. SUMMARY In one embodiment, a coal gasification method is provided. The method includes mixing a coal derived solid with an iron carbonate catalyst to form a reaction mixture, heating the reaction mixture to a target temperature between about 700° C. and about 900° C., contacting the reaction mixture with water vapor, and forming a syngas mixture from the reaction mixture. In another embodiment, a coal gasification method is provided. The method includes mixing a coal derived powder with a calcined iron carbonate catalyst to form a reaction mixture and heating the reaction mixture to a target temperature between about 700° C. and about 900° C.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION Embodiments described herein generally relate to iron carbonate utilized as a catalyst in coal gasification processes. Methods described herein also include suitable processing conditions for performing coal gasification with the FeCO3 catalyst. FeCO3 may be utilized to catalyze coal gasification reactions and improve the yield of syngas, which includes H2, CO, and CO2, among other gases and byproducts. By lowering the activation energy required to perform coal gasification, FeCO3 improves the efficiency of coal gasification and also reduces the amount of coal tar generated during coal gasification by increasing the volatility of coal tar. FeCO3 is relatively inexpensive, making FeCO3 a suitable catalyst for industrial scale applications. While the examples provided herein are described with regard to results obtained in a laboratory setting, it is contemplated that the processes and methods below may be scaled up for commercial and industrial applications. EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Material Preparation Catalytic gasification of a Wyodak low-sulfur sub-bituminous coal from the Powder River Basin of Wyoming was investigated using an inexpensive iron carbonate catalyst applied via incipient wetness impregnation. Experiments in an atmospheric pressure fixed-bed laboratory gasifier were performed to evaluate the effects of reaction temperature, feed gas steam content, and FeCO3 loading on the catalytic gasification of the Wyodak coal. The FeCO3 catalyst is active in both pyrolysis and gasification operations, and may increase carbon conversion rate and reduce the activation energy of coal gasification. The FeCO3 catalyst was prepared in a FeSO4.7H2O solution by adding 50 g FeSO4.7H2O (99%, Alfa Products) to 125 ml distilled water, followed by titrating the solution with excess 10 wt % Na2CO3 solution made with Na2CO3 (99.8 wt %, FMC Inc.), which resulted in a light green precipitate of FeCO3. The precipitate was filtered and washed with the sodium carbonate solution to remove SO42−, washed again with distilled water, dried at 92° C., and calcined in air at 250° C. The FeCO3 material was sieved and the particles smaller than 125 μm were retained and stored in an air-tight dark colored glass jar to prevent changes in the moisture content and structure of the prepared calcined FeCO3. Predetermined quantities of the iron catalyst were dry mixed with raw Wyodak coal from the Wyoming Powder River Basin (PRB). Then, distilled water was mixed with the resulting material using incipient wetness impregnation method to produce the Fe-coal mixtures. 80 wt % of the coal particles used were smaller than 74 μm. The nominal loadings of iron on the coal were calculated on a dry and ash free (DAF) coal basis. A reference sample was prepared using only distilled water. The resulting Fe-coal mixtures were air-dried at 98° C. (371 K) to constant mass and then stored in an air-tight receptacle to prevent further changes in moisture content or loss of volatile matter. Characterization Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) tests were performed using a TA Instruments SDT Q600 apparatus. The first TGA operation loaded an approximately 50 mg coal sample into a ceramic capped alumina sample holder, which was followed by 10 minutes of isothermal equilibration, heating at 20° C./min within a 100 ml/min flowing Ar or N2 (Ultra High Purity (UHP), US Welding) environment to a maximum pyrolysis temperature of 1200° C. The sample was held at the temperature for another 10 minutes for isothermal equilibration. The weight percentage of the char generated at a given temperature was calculated using the weight of the residual material (char) in the sample pan of the TGA apparatus at the particular temperature relative to the initial weight of coal sample. The proximate analyses of the raw coal were performed according to ASTM D5142 and D5016. The ultimate analyses for raw coal and chars produced at 700° C., 800° C., and 900° C. were accomplished using ASTM methods D5373, D5016, and D4239. The chemical composition of the coal ash was measured using ASTM D6349. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses were performed on powdered coal samples in a Philips X′pert PW3040-MPD. Analyses were conducted using Cu Ka radiation with 2Θ ranging from 15° to 85° with 0.010° steps and a time/step of 0.05 seconds. 0.05-0.10 g of finely powdered samples were collected before pyrolysis, during pyrolysis at 420° C., after pyrolysis, and 10 min or 20 min after gasification with steam started. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)/Raman analyses were performed on a Nicolet Magna 760 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The instrument has a 1064 nm Nd:YVO4 excitation laser, an XT-KBr beam splitter, a He—Ne laser for sample alignment, a InGaAs detector, and a computer for automated spectra collection and analysis. Mössbauer spectra were acquired at 295 K, 80 K, and 4 K using a source of approximately 30 mCi57Co in Rh on a WEB Research Co. model WT302 spectrometer equipped with a Janus closed cycle He cooling system. For Mossbauer analysis, coal samples were mixed with sucrose under acetone and placed in a holder backed by KAPTON® polyimide film tape. The pure coal sample was run without sucrose; others analysis used approximately 40 mg of sample and approximately 260 mg of sucrose to dilute the sample and improve spectral acquisition. Data were collected over a ±10 mm/s velocity range in 2048 channels with acquisition times ranging from 12 hours to 6 days, depending on the Fe content of the samples. Spectra were corrected for nonlinearity via interpolation to a linear velocity scale, which is defined by the spectrum of the 25 μm Fe foil used for calibration. All data were corrected to remove the fraction of the baseline due to the Compton scattering of 122 keV gamma rays by electrons inside the detector. All spectra were fit using Mexdisd. Gasification FIG. 1 illustrates a gasification apparatus utilized to perform the processes described herein. FIG. 1 shows a schematic diagram of catalytic coal gasification with the following reference numerals: (1a) N2, (1b) O2, (1c) CO, (1d) CO2; (2) mass flow controller; (3) high pressure pump; (4) back pressure regulator; (5) boiler; (6) heat traced stainless steel tubing; (7) thermocouples; (8) pressure relief valve; (9) stainless steel reactor; (10) furnace; (11) coal; (12) ceramic wool stopper; (13) back pressure regulator; (14) three way valve; (15) water-cooled condenser; (16) and (17) pressure gauges; (18) water trap; (19) flow meter (GC); (20) gas chromatograph (GC); (21) data acquisition system; and (22) water condensing and tar collection. The gasifier body is a stainless steel tube in a tube furnace. All tests were conducted at a pressure slightly above the ambient atmospheric pressure in laboratory. Note that due to the elevation of the laboratory (2,200 m), the ambient atmospheric pressure is about 75 kPa. Thus, the catalyzed coal gasification process may be performed at about 1 atm or less than about 1 atm. Catalyst-loaded coal samples were gasified in H2O—N2 mixtures. A quantity of coal sample corresponding to approximately five grams of dry and ash free (DAF) coal was used for each gasification test. An iron carbonate catalyst was added to the coal to form a reaction mixture. The examples described herein provide for a reaction mixture comprising about 3 wt % iron carbonate catalyst. In certain embodiments, the iron carbonate catalyst may be provided in the reaction mixture between about 1 wt % and about 5 wt %. The reaction mixture was heated in N2 at 20° C./minute to the desired gasification temperature and then water vapor was introduced. In one embodiment, the water vapor was introduced at a rate of about 0.04 g/min. In one embodiment, the water vapor is introduced in stoichiometric excess of the reaction mixture. The coal gasification kinetic experiments used the following inlet gases (1): N2 (UHP, US Welding), O2 (UHP, Air Liquide), CO (UHP, US Welding), and CO2 (UHP, Praxair). The aforementioned gases may be omitted in a process for gasifying coal according to the methods described herein. The flow rate of each gas into the process was controlled via the mass flow controller 2 (Porter Instruments series 201) with a 4 channel PCIM4 controller. Water was supplied by the high pressure pump 3 (Scientific Systems-Lab Alliance Series 1) with the back pressure regulator 4 (GO Regulator) and vaporized in a coil type vaporizer 5 wrapped with heating tape, although any source of steam or water vapor may be used. The stainless steel tubing before and after the reactor was heat traced 6, with the temperatures of the tubing monitored by thermocouples 7 as indicated, to preheat the gas/water vapor mixture and to prevent coal tar and water condensation in the reactor outlet. Alternately, the tubing, or piping, before and after the reactor may be insulated. The reactor assembly consisted of a ½ inch (13 mm) diameter tubular stainless steel reactor 9, with ceramic wool 12 supporting the coal sample. Outside the reactor, ceramic wool was also used for additional insulation, although any suitable material known in the art may be used for insulation and/or support. The reactor was temperature controlled in the tube furnace 10 (Thermolyne 21100), although any suitable heat source may be used, including piping inside the reactor that contains a hot material such as hot oil or steam. In another alternate embodiment, an inert gas may be heated outside the reactor and flowed into the reactor to deliver heat. The water cooled condenser 15 was utilized to separated the tar and water in the product gas from syngas produced as a result of the coal gasification process. The tar and water were also collected for analysis. The system pressure was regulated by the back pressure regulator 13 (GO Regulator) and monitored using pressure gauges 16, 17. The reactor was protected against over-pressure using a pressure relief valve 8. The flow rate of the remaining product gases was measured before venting to the fume hood. Alternately, the product gases may be collected, stored, subsequently processed or purified, and/or shipped via container or pipeline. For experimental purposes, a slipstream was diverted through a desiccant-filled water trap 18 to the gas chromatograph 20 (Agilent 3000A micro GC) equipped with two micro-columns (18 m MolSieve 5A PLOT and 4 m PoraPlot U) to separate H2, CO, N2, CO2, and light hydrocarbons, such as CH4, prior to concentration analysis using a calibrated thermal conductivity detector (TCD). All data were recorded on the data acquisition system 21. Residence time of the catalyzed coal at reaction conditions may be up to 5,000 minutes and is usually at least about 100 minutes, such as between about 100 minutes and about 3,000 minutes, for example between about 100 minutes and about 2,000 minutes. At higher temperatures, lower residence times may be used. For example in one embodiment, a residence time between about 50 minutes and about 100 minutes, for example about 80 minutes may be used. Coal Tar and Char Sampling The tar samples were collected with the ware from the reactor outlet stream by cooling the volatile matter produced during pyrolysis and gasification in the water/tar condenser 15. The collections of tar and char were performed for both raw coal and Fe-coal samples at 700° C., 800° C., and 900° C. under pyrolysis conditions with a heating rate of 20° C./minute in an N2 atmosphere. Pyrolysis was followed by steam gasification with an H2O of about 0.04 g/min for 10 and 20 minutes. After the chars were cooled in flowing N2, the samples were extracted and stored in N2, while the tar samples were collected and stored in vials under N2 to prevent property changes. Results and Discussion Characteristics of Raw Coal Proximate and ultimate analyses and heating value for the selected Wyodak coal are shown in Table 1.

The moisture content of the coal, as received, is nearly 21 wt %, which limits the measured heating value to 21,527 kJ/kg (9,255 BTU/lb) compared to 27,205 kJ/kg (11,696 BTU/lb) for the dry coal. The volatile matter fraction accounts for approximately 34 wt %. This portion generates flammable gases during pyrolysis and gives a more reactive character for the coal in entrained flow and fluidized bed gasification reactors. For other, lower-temperature gasification approaches, this volatile matter content would require a coal tar treatment unit operation. This is evident in the small-scale fixed-bed reactor facility used in this study, which included a dedicated coal tar separator. The ultimate analysis of this sub-bituminous coal shows the expected low sulfur content of 0.42 wt %. The relatively high oxygen content, calculated by difference at approximately 16 wt %, is advantageous for increasing this coal's reactivity during pyrolysis and for generating active sites during gasification. The analysis results of raw coal ash are provided in Table 2.

Therefore, the cations are not believed to play a role in the catalytic cycle, rather, the cations form coal ash and slag Gasification tests were started with a temperature ramping rate of about 20° C./minute. However, it is contemplated that the ramping rate may be between about 1° C./minute and about 50° C./minute, depending on the size of the reactor and the amount of coal to be gasified. Table 3 provides analysis of the coal char produced at different temperatures showing the elimination of H, O, S, and N from the structure of the material and the corresponding increase in the concentration of C and ash in the resulting coal chars. It is believed that material balances of the gases produced during pyrolysis are eliminated predominantly as H2, H2O, CO, CO2, N2, various sulfur compounds, and coal tar.

The mass of the coal samples analyzed was approximately 50 mg and the TGA operation conditions included a temperature ramping rate of 20° C./minute, Ar carrier gas environment at a flow rate of 100 ml/minute, and a maximum pyrolysis temperature of 1200° C. The weight percentage of the char generated at a given temperature was calculated using the weight of the residual material (char) in the sample pan of the TGA at the temperature relative to the initial weight of the coal sample. FIG. 2 illustrates that during pyrolysis, the weight loss of the treated coal generally follows the same curve as the untreated coal does. The temperatures at which maximum rate of mass loss occurs, corresponding to light gas and coal tar releases as shown in the inset of FIG. 2, is lowered from 443° C. for the raw coal to 433° C. for the 3 wt % Fe-coal. Another smaller maximum mass loss rate is centered at 719° C., which can be attributed to the reduction of iron oxides to elemental iron. The differences between 3 wt % Fe-coal and raw coal become evident above about 500° C., with slightly more mass loss for the treated coal above about 750° C. compared to the raw coal. Thus, it is believed that the iron is active not only during gasification but also during pyrolysis. XRD FIG. 3 illustrates the XRD spectrum of the FeCO3 calcined at 250° C. The strong characteristic peaks for hematite (Fe2O3) occur at 33.2°, 35.6°, 49.5°, 54.2°, 62.3°, and 64.2°, while the smaller peaks, e.g., at 31.2°, are those of siderite (FeCO3) and the products of its decomposition during its thermal treatment, including wustite ((FeO), e.g. at 42°, 61°, 36.2°), and magnetite (Fe3O4), e.g., at) 62.6°. It is believed that there may be some small quantities of sodium ferrite (NaFeO2) with a small peak at 16.7°, however, that determination is not definitive because other stronger characteristic peaks associated with other minerals also appear in that region. FIG. 4 illustrates XRD spectra of the iron catalyst mixed with raw coal. The upper spectrum in FIG. 4 is the XRD of the raw coal mixed with the iron catalyst and the lower spectra is the XRD for the catalyst, which is duplicated from FIG. 3 for comparison to emphasize the peaks characteristic to the catalyst relative to the peaks specific to the coal's organic material and the coal's accompanying minerals. In addition to the peaks identified in FIG. 3, the wide peaks at approximately 21.5°, 26.5°, and approximately 45.5° are characteristic of carbon compounds (e.g. graphite) in coal, while other large peaks are assigned to clay compound and various carbonates. FIG. 5 illustrates XRD spectra of the iron catalyst and coal after pyrolysis from ambient temperature (approximately 25° C.) to 420° C. at a ramping rate of 20° C./minute of a 5 g sample of DAF coal with an N2 flow rate of 4.1 ml. minute. The presence of strong peaks for magnetite (Fe3O4) at 35.5° and 62.6° indicates that the initial iron compounds were transformed into magnetite in the reaction environment. Further, the disappearance of the twin peaks of hematite (Fe2O3) at 62.3° and 45.5° become sharper, indicating the onset of graphitization of the pyrolyzed coal. Also visible are other large peaks which may be assigned to clay compound and several other carbonate species. FIG. 6 illustrates XRD spectra of the iron catalyst and coal after pyrolysis from ambient temperature (approximately 25° C.) to 800° C. at a ramping rate of 20° C./minute of a 5 g sample of DAF coal with an N2 flow rate of 4.1 ml. minute. When compared the XRD spectra in FIGS. 4 and 5, the peaks at 26.5° and 45.5° are more pronounced, indicating that the graphitization degree of the pyrolyzed coal has increased. The FIG. 6 spectra suggests the formation of cementite (Fe3C), characterized by a group of peaks centered at 45° and a more pronounced peak at 83.1°, which are mixed with the characteristic peaks of carbon and metallic Fe, with peaks at 43.9°, 51.2°, and 75.3°. FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate XRD spectra of the 3 wt % Fe coal after pyrolysis of a 5 g mass of DAF coal contacted with steam at 0.04 g/min in an N2 environment with a flow rate of 4.1 ml/minute at a temperature of 800° C. FIG. 7 illustrates 10 minutes of gasification under the aforementioned conditions. After 10 minutes of steam introduction, the intensity of the peak characteristic of FeO (wustite) increases, along with the peaks of metallic iron, while the peaks characteristic of Fe3C begin to decrease in intensity, which indicates that at least part of the Fe3C was transformed to iron and it is believed that some of the finely dispersed metallic iron was reoxidized to iron oxides. The trends illustrated in FIG. 7 are more pronounced in FIG. 8 which illustrates 20 minutes of gasification under the aforementioned conditions. The cementite peaks nearly dissipate (e.g.)83.1°, while metallic iron peaks remain (e.g. 75.3° and)82.6° and peaks associated with iron oxides, especially wustite (61°, 72.9°, and)76.6°, are present. Mössbauer Spectroscopy FIG. 9A illustrates Mossbauer spectra at 295 K of the iron catalyst and coal before pyrolysis. As illustrated, all of the iron in the catalyst is Fe+ in the form of hematite (Fe2O3). No other Fe-bearing phases were observed. FIG. 9B illustrates Mossbauer spectra at 295 K of the iron catalyst and coal after pyrolysis. As illustrated, a large doublet (43% of the total area at 295 K) that is associated with higher oxidation state iron, e.g. FeO4 groups, with a strong signature of metallic Fe accounting for approximately 32% of the total Fe and small peaks that are believed to represent Fe3C. A small doublet representing 7% of the total Fe has parameters believed to be consistent with six-coordinated Fe3+. FIG. 9C illustrates Mossbauer spectra at 295 K of the iron catalyst and coal after pyrolysis and 10 minutes of gasification. The higher oxidation state iron, accounting for 28% of total iron, is reduced to a ferric nanophase oxide representing 24% of the total Fe. Sextets associated with FeOOH and metallic iron, accounting for 9% and 40% of total iron, respectively, are also observed. It is believed that there is no evidence for cementite in the spectra of the gasified samples. Accordingly, the Mossbauer spectra results are generally consistent with the mineralogy observed with XRD. FTIR of the Coal Tar FIG. 10 illustrates FTIR analysis of the coal tar collected during pyrolysis (max. temp: 800° C.) and 10 minutes of gasification (mass of DAF coal: 5 g; H2O: 0.04 g/min; N2 flow rate: 4.1 ml/min; Temp.: 800° C.) for the uncatalyzed coal samples and 3 wt % Fe catalyzed coal samples. The coal tar condensed in the collection system by the water-cooling unit 15 (See FIG. 1) and was then retrieved for analysis. The large peak at approximately 3450 cm−1 (characteristic of water) has two shoulders, one at approximately 3150 cm−1 characteristic to H present in substituted aromatic rings and a smaller peak at approximately 2950 cm−1 characteristic of H in CH2 structures (aliphatic hydrocarbons or branches). The ratio of these two peaks is Haro/Hali>1, which suggests the aromatic character of the coal tar collected. The presence of the two peaks at approximately 1630 and 1550 cm−1 (C═C aromatic ring stretching vibrations), shifted due to various degrees of ring substitution, while the aromatic H out of plane bend at low degrees of substitution. Aromatic ring torsions also display a wide band with many overlaps over 500-900 cm−1. The presence of aliphatic groups is indicated by the small peak characteristic for C—C—C bending at approximately 1010 cm−1, the peak at approximately 2950 cm−1 (H in aliphatic CH2 structures mentioned previously), and by the peak at 1400 cm−1 characteristic of H in aliphatic CH3 structures and also for CH2 and CH3 deformations and O—O—H in-plane bending. All four spectra are similar. However, there are some important differences for the bottom two spectra in FIG. 10, which are of the tar collected from the 3 wt % Fe catalyzed coal samples. Compared to the spectra for the samples without the catalyst, several peaks are absent, including the small peaks at 1250 cm−1 (assigned to C—O bond stretching), the peak at 1100 cm−1 (assigned to organic O H stretching), and the double peaks at 2366 and 2328 cm−1, which could be the products of various physical phenomena (e.g., overtones), but can be assigned to the CO2 asymmetric stretch. The 1630 and 1550 cm−1 peaks for the coal tar produced from pyrolysis only (without gasification) in the presence of the iron catalyst have a peak height ratio larger than one (i.e., the 1630 cm−1 peak is larger), while all the other samples displayed a ratio smaller than one (i.e., the 1550 cm−1 peak is larger). The implication of the declining ratio is discussed below. The peak of C—O stretching (from ketones, aldehydes or carboxylic acids), expected in the interval 1690-1780 cm−1 is absent, although it might be shifted. Pyrolysis The iron catalyst at the beginning of the pyrolysis process, as shown by the XRD (See FIG. 3) and Mössbauer spectroscopy (See FIG. 9(a) is comprised mostly of hematite (Fe2O3), siderite (FeCO3), various oxides, and possibly ferrites. After mixing with coal and drying, the catalyst particles are in close contact with coal particles. When coal was heated in the absence of oxygen, the pyrolysis process produces variable quantities of H2, CH4, CO, and CO2, together with complex mixtures of organic substances (coal tar), in the vapor phase in the presence of the solid coal residue (char). Thus, the reaction environment is reducing in nature, which causes the decomposition of the traces of iron carbonate to iron oxides and the reduction of iron oxides to iron and iron carbide above 719° C., as shown by the TGA, XRD, and Mossbauer analyses. The reducing environment was previously discussed with the TGA data, in which the decrease in the maximum mass loss rate by 10° C. from 443° C. for the raw coal to 433° C. for the catalyzed coal can be explained by the transformation of various iron oxides to magnetite, as evidenced by the XRD analysis (See FIG. 5). The cut temperature for the reactor outlet gases collected as liquid coal tar was set by the water-cooled condenser (See FIG. 1 item 15) at approximately 25° C. The addition of the iron catalyst to the coal caused the dynamic pressure drop in the tubing to decrease due to less tar condensation and also resulted in a smaller quantity of tar collected at the end of the test, which suggests that the tar was more volatile. TGA analysis shows a relatively small influence of the catalyst during pyrolysis. FTIR analysis shows a very similar spectra of high aromatic character, as previously described above. However, the addition of the iron catalyst produced tar without IR peaks at 1250 cm−1 resulting from C—O bonds stretching and 1100 cm−1 due to the stretching of organic O—H. The absence of those peaks suggests dehydroxylation of the molecules present in the coal tar under the influence of iron catalyst. It is believed that at least two mechanisms exist to describe the reaction. The first reaction is based on a redox mechanism, where the carbon bearing the OH bond is oxidized on the iron catalyst and transformed to aldehydes/ketones. A possible reaction that generates aldehydes is: [in-line-formulae]R—C1+H2—OH+Fe3+(O)→R—HC2+═O+H2O+Fe2+ (R1)[/in-line-formulae] The reaction, resulting from the redox ability of magnetite, is predicted by various oxygen transfer models on iron catalysts during interaction with coal at high temperature. Therefore, in the collected coal tar, it was expected to find a peak generated by C═O stretching (from ketones, aldehydes, or carboxylic acids) in the interval 1690-1780 cm−1. However, unless the peak is radically shifted to approximately 1630 cm−1, which is unlikely, the expected peak was not detected. The second mechanism is the dehydration of the coal tar with concomitant production of double bonds (alkenes) or: [in-line-formulae]R—CH2—CH2—OH→R—CH═CH2+H2O (R2)[/in-line-formulae] The reaction (R2) is generic. The OH groups may also be present on secondary or tertiary carbons. In this example, the reaction would likely produce a number of C═C structures, detectable by their characteristic peaks, but would also increase volatility of the coal tar by decreasing the number of hydrogen bonds present. The peak at 1630 cm−1 is typically associated with C═C stretching either in ring (aromatic) structures or in alkenes (aliphatic) structures. In examples when the coal tar is collected after the pyrolysis in the presence of the iron catalyst, the peak at 1630 cm−1 is larger than the peak at approximately 550 cm−1 due to the C═C ring stretch. Alternatively, in the tar sample collected after 10 min of gasification, the peak becomes smaller, suggesting the evaporation of the substances generating a larger peak at 1630 cm−1. The observation indicates a water gas shift (WGS) reaction associated mechanism, which is a mediated oxygen transfer from water to CO via adsorbed OH groups. The reaction is catalyzed by magnetite, where CO and H2 are present, together with CO2. This type of dehydration forming C═C bonds in organic molecules is surprising for magnetite and is more commonly associated with acidic catalysts. The dehydration reaction type also occurs on magnesium substituted alumina (MgyAlOx) and alumina phosphates loaded with transition metals. Catalytic Effect of FeCO3 on Gasification Kinetics The kinetics of coal gasification was evaluated in a temperature range of 700-900° C. with the shrinking core model: [in-line-formulae]dX/dt=kSC(1−X)2/3 [/in-line-formulae] where X represents carbon conversion fraction, t is the time, and kSC is the specific carbon conversion rate constant. FIG. 11 illustrates an Arrhenius plot showing the effect of temperature on the gasification reaction rate constant, kSC obtained with the shrinking core model for both the raw coal and the 3 wt % Fe coal. Using the shrinking model, the apparent activation energy results were 89.5 kJ/mol for the untreated coal, which decreased to 50.6 kJ/mol for the coal containing 3 wt % Fe. For comparison, conventional activation energy for similar raw coal based on the random pore model is 102.3 kJ/mol. Catalytic Gasification Mechanism FIGS. 12A and 12B illustrate data comparing the H2 and CO generated normalized per carbon in the char for coal samples untreated (dashed lines) and with 3 wt % Fe addition (solid lines) at 700° C. and 900° C. during the first 200 min of the embodiments described herein. As the reactor reaches the reaction temperature, there is an induction period of from about 10 to about 25 minutes before the catalytic reactions begin, which can be associated with phase transformation in catalytic material shown by XRD and Mössbauer analyses discussed earlier. The time required for the phase transformation is decreased as the temperature increases. FIGS. 12A and 12B also contain points around 770° C. which corresponds to approximately equal values of the reaction rate constant for the catalyzed and uncatalyzed systems. The effect of the iron catalyst on H2 production at both 700° C. and 900° C. (FIG. 12A) is evident after the induction period. In the 200-minute gasification period, 0.95 and 1.20 mol of H2 were generated at 700° C. with 1 mol uncatalyzed and catalyzed carbons in char, respectively. At 900° C., the difference becomes more pronounced because the quantity of H2 generated with catalyzed char is about 300% higher than that with uncatalyzed char. The quantities of CO generated at 700° C. with catalyzed and uncatalyzed chars within the same gasification period are similar while about 12% more CO was produced with catalyzed char than uncatalyzed char at 900° C., as demonstrated in FIG. 12B. The amounts of CO2 resulting from 200-minute gasification of catalyzed coal chars at 700° C. and 900° C. are 13% and 25% higher, respectively. The accepted reaction model states that metallic iron, after reacting with steam, generates hydrogen and a layer of iron oxide on the surface of the particle. The oxide layer reacts with nearby carbon which may reduce iron oxide to metallic iron and generate carbon monoxide (R4), followed by the desorption of the carbon monoxide, as summarized in the following reactions: [in-line-formulae]Fe+H2O→Fe(O)+H2 (R3)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]Fe(O)+C→C(O)+Fe (R4)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]C(O)→CO (R5)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]C+H2O→CO+H2 (R6)[/in-line-formulae] The model presumes the iron species present in the catalyst is Fe0 and that the reaction takes place only if carbon is present in proximity of the metallic iron particle. The quantity of H2 generated during the catalytic cycle is equal to the quantity of H2 generated in an uncatalyzed cycle, as shown in the overall reaction (R6). As a result of the low mobility of iron, the rate of reaction may decrease if the interface between the catalytic particle and coal particles becomes depleted of carbon. The theoretical model with short distance interaction is consistent with the experimental observations and may mathematically be explained using shrinking core reaction model, which presumes that as the reaction progresses, the reactants and products pass through a layer of ash, with the reaction taking place at the shrinking core surface of unreacted material. Another mechanism that may generate H2 is the WGS reaction (R10) on FeO (wustite) with surface defects, with the CO2 produced being consumed by the Bouduard reaction (R9). The net result of these reactions remains the overall gasification reaction (R6): [in-line-formulae]3FeO+H2O→Fe3O4+H2 (R7)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]Fe3O4+CO→3FeO+CO2 (R8)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]CO2+C2CO (R9)[/in-line-formulae] [in-line-formulae]C+H2OCO+H2 [/in-line-formulae] The sum of (R7) and (R8) is the WGS reaction (R10): [in-line-formulae]H2O+COH2+CO2 (R10)[/in-line-formulae] In this example, the reaction may not require the presence of carbon in the immediate vicinity of the catalyst because the CO2 formed can easily transport through the gas phase to react at longer distances with the carbon in coal. The result of this reaction model is that the quantities of CO2 and H2 produced with iron catalyzed coal is larger compared with the uncatalyzed coal due to the water-gas-shift reaction. The uncatalyzed and slower Bouduard reaction determines the overall reaction rate (and thus the CO quantity will be similar or lower to that of uncatalyzed gasification), while the catalyzed and faster WGS reaction will produce more H2 and CO2. Table 4 illustrates the quantities of gasification products generated at various temperatures during coal gasification normalized for the quantities of carbon present in the char at the end of pyrolysis for untreated samples and samples treated with FeCO3 (3 wt % Fe). The data provided in Table 4 was generated based upon the following conditions: mass of DAF coal: 5 g; H2O: 0.04 g/min; N2 flow rate: 4.1 ml/min; gasification temp.: 700-900° C.

Comparing the quantities of CO and CO2 produced during gasification in the catalyzed and uncatalyzed examples, the quantities produced appear to be the result of the opposing trends with temperature for the equilibrium constants for the WGS and Bouduard reactions. The equilibrium constant for the exothermic WGS reaction decreases with increasing temperature, while the equilibrium constant for the endothermic Bouduard reaction increases. The comparison between the quantities of CO and CO2 generated, normalized for the quantities of carbon present in the char at the end of pyrolysis as function of temperature (FIG. 13 and Table 4), indicate that the presence of the iron catalyst generates slightly higher CO2 and less CO compared with the uncatalyzed example which suggests activity of iron oxides in the WGS reaction. The quantities of H2 normalized on the carbon present in char generated by reaction with H2O during gasification for the iron catalyzed reaction are larger (Table 4 and FIG. 14) at lower temperatures and become similar at higher temperatures compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. The increased H2 quantity at lower temperature is believed to be a result of the water-gas-shift reaction (R10), which suggests a FeO—Fe3O4 couple was present within the reaction environment in smaller quantities as the temperature of the exemplary reactions was increased. The values of H2 generated by reaction with H2O normalized on the carbon present in char were calculated by subtracting from the values of H2 produced during gasification the quantities of hydrogen left in the char structure after pyrolysis (See Table 3) and normalizing the result on the carbon present in char. As illustrated in iron catalyzed example of FIG. 14, larger quantities of H2 were generated per carbon from char for temperatures below about 850° C., indicating the presence of iron oxides in the catalytic mass. With reaction temperatures above about 850° C., the H2 quantity becomes similar to the uncatalyzed reaction, which suggests a catalytic mechanism driven by metallic iron. The FTIR and XRD analyses of the tar mentioned in the aforementioned sections suggests the participation of magnetite (Fe3O4) in coal pyrolysis. The data in FIGS. 7, 8 and 9A-9C suggest that metallic iron, iron carbide, and FeO—Fe3O4 are present during gasification and are catalysts for hydrogen generation. Thus, the wustite-magnetite couple appears also to be the active species during the gasification operation, but metallic iron was present during the fast gasification period. For the pyrolysis operation and volatilization of the tar, the phase equilibrium diagram for the temperatures utilized as depicted in FIG. 15 indicates the stability of magnetite during the temperature interval of the maximum pyrolysis rate, which is confirmed by XRD spectra presented in FIG. 5. The reduction of iron oxide occurs as a function of the temperature and concentration of CO, while the CO concentration in systems containing char is governed by the Bouduard reaction (R9). According to the phase equilibrium diagram for the Fe—O—C system with the Bouduard equilibrium curve plotted in FIG. 15, the reduction of iron oxides follows the concentration of CO at different temperatures. For example, at 433° C., the maximum temperature for the devolatilization rate during coal pyrolysis based on the TGA analysis, the Fe—O—C equilibrium diagram indicates that the stable iron phase is magnetite (Fe3O4), which is in accordance with the XRD results for the material collected after pyrolysis at 420° C. It is also believed that the dehydration reactions observed using FTIR may be attributed to magnetite. According to the curve for the Bouduard reaction illustrated in FIG. 15, metallic iron is generally in the stable phase a temperatures higher than about 700° C., such as higher than about 719° C. At temperatures greater than about 719° C., various phases of reduced iron are stable and the reduced iron phases are influenced by the interactions with other components and the oxidizing or reducing environment as indicated by the concentrations of steam, H2, etc. The XRD and Mössbauer data indicated that at about 800° C. after the pyrolysis operation, the iron phases present are metallic iron and cementite (Fe3C). After gasification was initiated by the introduction of steam, the cementite phase began to disappear while the metallic iron phase signal became larger, with several weak peaks attributed to iron oxides (wustite). The same analysis for different temperatures explains the increase in H2 production as a result of increased oxide formation (e.g. magnetite), as superficial oxide may be formed on wustite (See (R7) and (R8)). The decreased reaction rate constant at higher temperatures, due to the increased formation of iron carbide (Fe3C), is believed to be inert for gasification and WGS reactions. In summation, the addition of iron carbonate as a catalyst is beneficial to the coal gasification process. Beneficial results include the increased coal conversion rate and tar mitigation via volitalization, as well as increased H2 production at relatively low temperatures. Various iron species catalyze different portions of the coal gasification process resulting in a significant reduction in the activation energy associated with coal gasification.
