FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides method related generally to the field of protein production. Specifically, the present invention provides methods for selecting a mRNA for production of a polypeptide of interest. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Many factors influence protein production including gene copy number, gene location, transcription and translation efficiency, transcription factors and mRNA stability. Efforts have focused on the development of technology to manipulate these and other factors in order to increase protein production. Thus, for example, numerous reports of increased protein expression through altered codon usage are found in the literature, making this synthetic gene approach a common strategy for protein expression. Despite the reported advantages, often experimental observations underscore the importance of other factors in determining the efficiency of heterologous protein production. Thus, as yet no method has been devised that provides the level of predictability in protein production that is needed. Accordingly, the present invention addresses the previous shortcomings of the art by providing methods for selecting a mRNA producing a protein of interest at a desired amount.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION This description is not intended to be a detailed catalog of all the different ways in which the invention may be implemented, or all the features that may be added to the instant invention, For example, features illustrated with respect to one embodiment may be incorporated into other embodiments, and features illustrated with respect to a particular embodiment may be deleted from that embodiment. In addition, numerous variations and additions to the various embodiments suggested herein will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the instant disclosure, which do not depart from the instant invention. Hence, the following descriptions are intended to illustrate some particular embodiments of the invention, and not to exhaustively specify all permutations, combinations and variations thereof. The present inventors have discovered that by determining one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4. 5, etc.), or two or more (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.) thermodynamic variables of the secondary structure of an mRNA encoding a protein of interest, that a mRNA encoding a polypeptide of interest can be selected that produces a protein at a desired or preselected rate and/or level and/or under specific production conditions. Thus, some embodiments of the invention provide a method of selecting an mRNA for modulated (enhanced or diminished (e.g., reduced)) production of a polypeptide of interest. Accordingly, in some embodiments of the present invention a mRNA encoding a polypeptide of interest can be selected that produces an enhanced or increased amount of protein as compared to the amount of protein produced by the wild-type (i.e., native) mRNA encoding the same polypeptide of interest. In still other embodiments of the invention, a mRNA encoding a polypeptide of interest can be selected that produces a reduced or diminished amount of protein as compared to the amount of protein produced by the wild-type mRNA encoding the same polypeptide of interest. In further aspects of the invention, a first mRNA encoding a polypeptide of interest can he selected that produces an enhanced or increased amount of protein as compared to the amount of protein produced by a second mRNA (e.g., not the native mRNA) encoding the same polypeptide of interest. In still further aspects of the invention, a first mRNA encoding a polypeptide of interest can be selected that produces a diminished or reduced amount of protein as compared to the amount of protein produced by a second selected mRNA encoding the same polypeptide of interest. The amount of enhancement (e.g, increase) or diminishment (e.g., reduction; decrease) can be varied as desired based on the selection of the mRNA using the methods of the present invention. Thus, any mRNA of an array generated based on a native or a second mRNA but that produces a modified amount of a polypeptide of interest as compared to the wild type or native mRNA or second mRNA can be selected using the methods of this invention. In addition, the methods described here can be used as a tool to overcome RNA silencing. As an example, strong promoters are often used to generate a high level of RNA transcript. However, as is known by those of skill in the art, strong promoters often result in gene silencing. Instead, a moderate or weak promoter can be used in combination with a gene construct comprising a mRNA selected according to the methods of the present invention to produce a mRNA transcript that is more efficiently translated. Thus, despite the use of a weak or moderate promoter, a high level of protein production can be achieved using the methods of the present invention that can identify mRNA transcripts that are more efficiently translated and at the same time avoiding gene silencing due to high transcript levels. Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention provides a method of selecti ng a mRNA for production of a polypeptide of interest, the method comprising; a) producing an array of individual mRNA sequences comprising different nucleotide sequences encoding the polypeptide of interest; b) determining one or more of the following parameters for each individual mRNA sequence of (a): (i) ensemble free energy (EFE); (ii) frequency of the minimum free energy (FMFE) RNA secondary structure in a thermodynamic ensemble; and (iii) ensemble diversity (ED); c) ranking the individual mRNA sequences of the array according to the parameters determined in step (b); and d) selecting a mRNA sequence from the ranked array of step (c), wherein the selected mRNA produces the polypeptide of interest. In some embodiments, when two or more parameters are determined, the ranking the individual mRNA sequences of the array in step (c) is according to joint distribution of the parameters determined in step (b), as described previously. A further aspect of the invention provides a method of selecting a mRNA for production of a polypeptide of interest, the method comprising: a) producing an array of individual mRNA sequences comprising different nucleotide sequences encoding the polypeptide of interest; b) determining minimum free energy (MFE) RNA secondary structure for each individual mRNA sequence of (a); c) determining one or more of the following parameters for each individual mRNA sequence of (a): (i) frequency of the minimum free energy (FMFE) RNA secondary structure in a thermodynamic ensemble; and (ii) ensemble diversity (ED); d) ranking the individual mRNA sequences of the array according to a joint distribution of the parameters determined in (b) and (c) above; and ℮) selecting a mRNA sequence from the ranked array of step (d), wherein the selected mRNA produces the polypeptide of interest, In other aspects, the present invention provides a method of selecting a mRNA for production of a polypeptide of interest, the method comprising: a) producing an array of individual mRNA sequences comprising different nucleotide sequences encoding the polypeptide of interest; b) determining ensemble free energy (EFE) for each individual mRNA sequence of (a); c) determining one or more of the following parameters for each individual mRNA sequence of (a): (i) frequency of the minimum free energy (FMFE) RNA secondary structure in a thermodynamic ensemble; and (ii) ensemble diversity (ED); d) ranking the individual mRNA sequences of the array according to a joint distribution of the parameters determined in (b) and (c) above; and ℮) selecting a mRNA sequence from the ranked array of step (d), wherein the selected mRNA produces the polypeptide of interest. Accordingly, in some embodiments of the present invention, the following parameters or combination of parameters can be determined for each individual mRNA sequence of an array and used to rank the individual mRNA sequences (it is noted that when two or more parameters are determined the ranking is according to a joint distribution of the parameters): (1) EFE; (2) FMFE; (3) MFE; (4) ED; (5) EFE and FMFE; (6) EFE and ED; (7) FMFE and ED; (8) EFE, FMFE and ED; (9) MFE and FMFE; (10) MFE and ED; and (11) MFE, FMFE and ED. Further, in some aspects, the present invention further comprises determining base pairing probability (ΒΡΡ) for each individual mRNA sequence in addition to the parameters or combinations of parameters described above. Thus, as further provided herein, the following combinations of parameters can be determined for each individual mRNA sequence of an array and used to rank the individual mRNA sequences according to a joint distribution: (1) EFE and ΒΡΡ; (2) FMFE and ΒΡΡ; (3) ED and ΒΡΡ; (4) EFE, FMFE and ΒΡΡ; (5) EFE, ED and ΒΡΡ; (6) FMFE, ED and ΒΡΡ; (7) EFE, FMFE, ED and ΒΡΡ; (8) MFE, FMFE and ΒΡΡ; (9) MFE, ED and ΒΡΡ; and (10) MFE, FMFE, ED and ΒΡΡ. It will be understood that, although the terms "first," "second," etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, these elements should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element from another. Thus, a "first" element (e.g., a first mRNA sequence) discussed below could also be termed a "second" element (e.g., a second mRNA sequence) without departing from the teachings of the present invention. "Wild type" nucleic acid, nucleotide sequence, polypeptide or amino acid sequence refers to a naturally occurring ("native ") or endogenous nucleic acid, nucleotide sequence, polypeptide or amino acid sequence. Thus, a "wild type mRNA" is an mRNA that is naturally occurring in or endogenous to the organism. As used herein, the term "thermodynamic optimization method" means any implementation of the Zuker algorithm for determining the minimum free energy structure of a nucleic add molecule (Zuker et al., Nucleic Acids Research, 9, 133-148 (1981); see also, Mathews et al, J Mol. Biol. 288:911-940 (1999) and Walter et al., PNAS 91:9218-9222 (1994)). The term "minimum free energy RNA secondary structure" (MFE) as used herein means the structure found by thermodynamic optimization (i.e. an implementation of the Zuker algorithm (Μ. Zuker and Ρ. Stiegler., Nucleic Acids Research 9:133-148 (1981)) that has the lowest tree energy value. The term "frequency of the minimum free energy RNA secondary structure" (FMFE) refers to the fraction of the MFE structure in the thermodynamic ensemble: (eA(-E/kT))/Z. where Ε is the minimum free energy of the structure, k is the Boltzmann constant, Τ is the temperature and Ζ is the partition function (Wuchty et al., Biopolymers 49:145-165 (1999)). Accordingly, the partition function and the structures of the thermodynamic ensemble are used in determination of the FMFE RNA secondary structure. As used herein, the term "partition function" refers to partition function as defined by J.S. McCasldll {Biopolymers 29:1105-1119 (1990)): Ζ = sum( e A [ Ei / kT ] ), where Ei is the free energy of structure i and the sum is taken over all structures (from i = 1 to i = η) for a given sequence. The term "ensemble free energy" (EFE) as used herein means -kT * In Ζ, where k, Τ, and Ζ are defined as above and implemented e.g. in the ViennaRNA software package (I.L. Hofacker et al, Monatsh. Chem., 125: 167-188 (1994)). The ensemble free energy is defined by J.S. McCaskill in Biopolymers 29:1105-1119 (1990). As used herein, the term "ensemble diversity" (ED) means the average base pair difference between all structures in the themodynamic ensemble: sum a,b p a * p_b * d(a,b), where the sum goes over all pairs of possible structure a,b, p_a is the Boltzmann weight of structure a, and d(a,b) is the base pair distance, where base pair distance is defined by Wuchty et al. in Biopolymers 49:145-165 (1999)). "Joint distribution" of the parameters defines the probability of events in terms of the particular parameters determined such as MFE, EFE, FMFE, ED and/or ΒΡΡ. Thus, when two or more of the parameters MFE, EFE, FMFE, ED and/or ΒΡΡ are determined, a joint distribution is used to rank the mRNAs according to the values determined for each parameter for each individual mRNA. Thus, as used herein, "joint distribution" can be defined by selection of an initial fraction of sequences of interest (e.g., the upper 5% of the MFE structures, as defined above) and then using the other parameter that was determined (e.g., FMFE) to select a fraction of the initial fraction. For example, take the upper and lower 10% of the MFE structures (e.g., for enhanced and reduced expression, respectively), and then take the top 50% of each of those fractions according to their FMFE value. The term "base pairing probability" (ΒΡΡ) as used herein means the average across all positions in the nucleotide sequence of the per-position Shannon entropies of the base pairing probabilities. The calculation of the base pairing probabilities is defined by J.S. McCaskill (Biopolymers 29:1105-1119 (1990)) and implemented, for example, in the ViennaRNA software package (I.L. Hofacker et al., Monatsh. Chem., 125:167-188 (1994)). The calculation of the entropy values is described by Μ. Huynen (JMol. Biol. 267:1104-1112 (1997)). In particular embodiments of the present invention, the methods comprise producing an array of individual mRNA sequences comprising different nucleotide sequences encoding the polypeptide of interest. In some embodiments of the present invention, an array is produced by backtranslating a polypeptide of interest to produce mRNAs that encode the polypeptide of interest. In particular embodiments, an array is produced by backtranslating the N-terminal end of a polypeptide of interest to produce mRNAs that encode the N-terminal end of a polypeptide of interest. In further embodiments, an array is produced by backtranslating the N-terminal end of a polypeptide of interest to produce mRNAs that encode the N-terminal end of the polypeptide of interest, wherein the individual mRNAs that are produced comprise a start codon and a length of about 20 to 70 nucleotides. Thus, in some embodiments, an array of individual mRNA sequences is produced, wherein the individual mRNA sequences each comprise the start codon and a length of about 20 to about 25 nucleotides, about 20 to about 30 nucleotides, about 20 to about 35 nucleotides, about 20 to about 40 nucleotides, about 20 to about 45 nucleotides, about 20 to about 50 nucleotides, about 20 to about 55 nucleotides, about 20 to about 55 nucleotides, about 20 to about 60 nucleotides, about 20 to about 65 nucleotides, about 25 to about 30 nucleotides, about 25 to about 35 nucleotides, about 25 to about 40 nucleotides, about 25 to about 45 nucleotides, about 25 to about 50 nucleotides, about 25 to about 55 nucleotides, about 25 to about 60 nucleotides, about 25 to about 65 nucleotides, about 25 nucleotides to about 70 nucleotides, about 30 to about 35 nucleotides, about 30 to about 40 nucleotides, about 30 to about 45 nucleotides, about 30 to about 55 nucleotides, about 30 to about 55 nucleotides, about 30 to about 60 nucleotides, about 30 to about 65 nucleotides, about 30 nucleotides to about 70 nucleotides, about 35 to about 40 nucleotides, about 35 to about 45 nucleotides, about 35 to about 50 nucleotides, about 35 to about 55 nucleotides, about 35 to about 60 nucleotides, about 35 to about 65 nucleotides, about 35 to about 70 nucleotides, about 40 to about 45 nucleotides, about 40 to about 50 nucleotides, about 40 to about 55 nucleotides, about 40 to about 60 nucleotides, about 40 to about 65 nucleotides, about 40 to about 70 nucleotides, about 45 to about 50 nucleotides, about 45 to about 55 nucleotides, about 45 nucleotides to about 60 nucleotides, about 45 to about 65 nucleotides, about 45 to about 70 nucleotides, about 50 to about 55 nucleotides, about 50 to about 60 nucleotides, about 50 to about 65 nucleotides, about 50 to about 70 nucleotides, about 55 to about 60 nucleotides, about 55 to about 65 nucleotides, about 55 to about 70 nucleotides, about 60 to about 65 nucleotides, about 60 to about 70 nucleotides, about 65 to about 70 nucleotides, and the like. Thus, in further embodiments, the individual mRNA sequences of an array comprise a start codon and a length of about 20 nucleotides, about 21 nucleotides, about 22 nucleotides, about 23 nucleotides, about 24 nucleotides, about 25 nucleotides, about 26 nucleotides, about 27 nucleotides, about 28 nucleotides, about 29 nucleotides, about 30 nucleotides, about 31 nucleotides, about 32 nucleotides, about 33 nucleotides, about 34 nucleotides, about 35 nucleotides, about 36 nucleotides, about 37 nucleotides, about 38 nucleotides, about 39 nucleotides, about 40 nucleotides, about 41 nucleotides, about 42 nucleotides, about 43 nucleotides, about 44 nucleotides, about 45 nucleotides, about 46 nucleotides, about 47 nucleotides, about 48 nucleotides, about 49 nucleotides, about 50 nucleotides, about 51 nucleotides, about 52 nucleotides, about 53 nucleotides, about 54 nucleotides, about 55 nucleotides, about 56 nucleotides, about 57 nucleotides, about 58 nucleotides, about 59 nucleotides, about 60 nucleotides, about 61 nucleotides, about 62 nucleotides, about 63 nucleotides, about 64 nucleotides, about 65 nucleotides, about 66 nucleotides, about 67 nucleotides, about 68 nucleotides, about 69 nucleotides, or about 70 nucleotides. In particular embodiments of the invention, the individual mRNA sequences of an array comprise a start codon and about 40 nucleotides. In further embodiments of the present invention, the individual mRNA sequences of the array comprise nucleotides at positions -20 through 50 relative to the start codon (i.e., the A of the ATG (AUG) start codon is zero). In some particular embodiments of the invention, the 5' ends of the individual mRNA sequences comprise nucleotides at positions -4 through 35 relative to the start codon. In additional embodiments of the invention, the 5' ends of the individual mRNA sequences comprise nucleotides at positions -4 through 37 relative to the start codon. In other embodiments, the individual mRNA sequences comprise nucleotides at positions -15 through 50 relative to the start codon, at positions -10 through 50 relative to the start codon, at positions -5 through 50 relative to the start codon, at positions -20 through 45 relative to the start codon, at positions -15 through 45 relative to the start codon, at positions 10 through 45 relative to the start codon, at positions -5 through 45 relative to the start codon, at positions -20 through 40 relative to the start codon, at positions -15 through 40 relative to the start codon, at positions -10 through 40 relative to the start codon, at positions -5 through 40 relative to the start codon, at positions -20 through 35 relative to the start codon, at positions -15 through 35 relative to the start codon, at positions -10 through 35 relative to the start codon, at positions -5 through 35 relative to the start codon, at positions -20 through 30 relative to the start codon, at positions -15 through 30 relative to the start codon, at positions 10 through 30 relative to the start codon, at positions -5 through 30 relative to the start codon, at positions -20 through 25 relative to the start codon, at positions -15 through 25 relative to the start codon, at positions -10 through 25 relative to the start codon, at positions -5 through 25 relative to the start codon, at positions -20 through 20 relative to the start codon, at positions -15 through 20 relative to the start codon, at positions -10 through 20 relative to the start codon, at positions -5 through 20 relative to the start codon, at positions -20 through 15 relative to the start codon, at positions -15 through 15 relative to the start codon, at positions 10 through 15 relative to the start codon, at positions -5 through 15 relative to the start codon, at positions -20 through 10 relative to the start codon, at positions -15 through 10 relative to the start codon, at positions -10 through 10 relative to the start codon, and the like. Thus, in some particular embodiments, the individual mRNA sequences of an array comprise a start codon and about 40 nucleotides with the 5' end of the individual mRNA sequences comprising nucleotides at positions -4 through 35 relative to the start codon. In some embodiments of the present invention, an array is produced comprising all possible mRNAs that encode the polypeptide of interest. In o ther embodiments of the invention, an array is produced that is a "representative array." Thus, as used herein, a representative array means an array in which not all mRNAs that could possibly encode for a polypeptide of interest are produced and evaluated for the parameters described herein but instead a subpopulation or subgroup that is representative of the distribution of mRNAs that could encode for the polypeptide of interest is produced and evaluated. A representative array can be produced using biased or unbiased protocols as known in the art. A non-limiting example of an unbiased method of generating a representative array begins with an input amino acid sequence. An automated random sampling procedure is used to generate nucleotide sequences encoding the input amino acid sequence (e.g., BioPerl). (Stajich et al. Genome Res 12(10): 1611 -8 (2002)), For each position in the amino acid sequence, codons for that position are selected by sampling the possible codons from a uniform distribution. Thus, in some embodiments, ten thousand nucleotide sequences are produced in this manner for each input amino acid sequence. In other embodiments, a larger or smaller number of nucleotide sequences arc produced. The number of sequences produced will depend on a number of factors including the length of the input amino acid sequence. Accordingly, in some particular embodiments of the invention, an array comprises about 103 to about 108 individual mRNA sequences. In other embodiments, an array of the invention comprises about 103, about 2xl03, about 4xl03, about 6><103, about 8xl03, about 104, about 2xl04, about 4xl04, about 6xl04, about 8xl04, about 105, about 2X105, about 4xl05, about 6xl05, about 8xl05, about 106, about 2xl06, about 4xl06, about 6xl06, about 8xl06, about 107, about 2χ107. about 4xl07, about 6xl07, about 8xl07, or about 10s individual mRNA sequences. As described herein, the present invention provides methods of selecting a mRNA having a desired level of production of a polypeptide of interest. Thus, in some embodiments, the present invention provides a method of selecting a mRNA for production of a polypeptide of interest, wherein the production of the polypeptide of interest is enhanced. In other embodiments, a method is provided for selecting a mRNA for production of a polypeptide of interest, wherein the production of the polypeptide of interest is reduced. A mRNA selected as described herein can have slightly enhanced, moderately enhanced or greatly enhanced protein production. In other embodiments of the invention, a mRNA can be selected having a desired level of protein production that is slightly reduced, moderately reduced or greatly reduced. In some embodiments, the level of protein production by a selected mRNA is enhanced or reduced as compared to the production of the same polypeptide of interest by the wild-type mRNA, In some embodiments, a mRNA sequence is selected that produces the same amount of protein as compared to the production of the same polypeptide of interest by the wild-type mRNA (0% enhanced or reduced). As used herein, slightly enhanced or slightly reduced can mean a change in production of a polypeptide of interest of about 0.0001%, 0.0005%, 0.001%, 0.005%, 0.01%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25%, and the like, as compared to a native mRNA or other selected mRNA, Moderately enhanced or moderately reduced can mean a change in production of a polypeptide of interest of about 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%>, 29%, 30%, 31%, 32%, 33%, 34%, 35%, 36%, 37%, 38%, 39%, 40%, 41%, 42%, 43%, 44%, 45%, and the like as compared to a native mRNA or other selected mRNA. Greatly enhanced or greatly reduced can mean a change in production of a polypeptide of interest of about 45% to about 100% (e.g., 45%, 46%, 47%, 48%, 49%, 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 100%, etc.) as compared to a native mRNA or other selected mRNA, In other embodiments, the present invention provides a method of selecting a first mRNA (selected mRNA) for production of a polypeptide of interest, wherein the production of the polypeptide of interest by the first mRNA is enhanced or reduced as compared to the production of the polypeptide by a second mRNA that encodes the same polypeptide of interest as encoded by the first mRNA. Thus, the present invention provides methods for selecting an mRNA based on its ranking within the distribution of values for each parameter determined for the individual mRNA sequences in the array. Thus, for example, the mRNAs of an array are ranked from highest to lowest value for each parameter determined (i.e., MFE RNA secondary structure, EFE, FMFE RNA secondary structure, ED and/or ΒΡΡ); thus, providing a distribution of mRNAs coding for a single polypeptide of interest but having different values for the determined parameter (i.e, MFE RNA secondary structure, EFE, FMFE RNA secondary structure, ED, and/or ΒΡΡ). The distribution can be described as ranging from the highest value at 100% to the lowest value at less than 1% (e.g., 0.0001%, 0.0005%, 0.001%, 0.005%, 0.01%, etc.). A mRNA can be selected from anywhere along the distribution from less than 1% (e.g., 0.0001%, 0.0005%, 0.001%, 0,005%, 0.01%, etc.) to 100%. Thus, by selecting a mRNA as described herein a desired level of protein production can be achieved. Accordingly, in some embodiments of the present invention, a mRNA can be selected from among the mRNAs of a given array having an MFE RNA secondary structure value between about 95%-100% of the highest MFE value determined for that array of sequences. In other embodiments, a mRNA can be selected from among the mRNA sequences having an MFE value in a range of between about 90%-100%, 85%-100%, 90%-95%, 85%-95%, 80%-5%-1 0%, 0%-5%, and the like, of the highest MFE value determined for that array of mRNA sequences. Thus, in some embodiments, a mRNA can be selected from among the mRNA sequences having an MFE value of about 0.0001%, 0.0005%, 0.001%, 0.005%, 0.01%, 0,05%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, 21%, 22%, 23%, 24%, 25%, 26%, 27%, 28%, 29%, 30%, 31%, 32%, 33%, 34%, 35%, 36%, 37%, 38%, 39%, 40%, 41%, 42%, 43%, 44%, 45%, 46%, 47%, 48%, 49%, 50%, 51%, 52%, 53%, 54%, 55%, 56%, 57%, 58%, 59%, 60%, 61%, 62%, 63%, 64%, 65%, 66%, 67%, 68%, 69%, 70%, 71%, 72%, 73%, 74%, 75%, 76%, 77%, 78%, 79%, 80%, 81%, 82%, 83%, 84%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 100% of the highest MFE value determined for that array of sequences. In other embodiments, the MFE RNA secondary structure (MFE) value versus level of protein production for the mRNAs within the array does not form a linear pattern but instead forms a step-wise pattern with the mRNAS falling into groups in which the level of expression or protein production is the same for the mRNAs within each group despite having different MFE values. Specifically, in a step-wise pattern, when other factors affecting protein expression hold constant, mRNAs with MFE values falling within a particular range can have same protein expression level. Thus, the grouping of mRNAs in some embodiments is based on the calculated MFE. A step-wise pattern of expression level can occur because the energy required to open up a given mRNA structure for translation can be the same for mRNAs having different MFE values. Thus, for example, the ,AG° for hydrolysis of a single GTP to GDP at 25°C is -6,95 kcal/mol (at 37°C the /\G° is -7,14). Accordingly, in some instances, certain mRNAs having different MFE values can each require the energy of a single GTP (a “single packet of energy”) in order to open up their structure for translation. Thus, the level of expression or protein production from those mRNAs requiring a “single packet of energy” (e.g., ATP, GTP and the like) can be the same or similar despite the different MFE values and therefore, similar levels of protein production can be achieved by selecting any mRNA from within a particular range of MFE values. As an example, a mRNA having a MFE value of -3 kcal/mol and another mRNA having MFE value of -6 kcal/mol, both may require one or less than one packet of energy in order to open up their structure for translation. Consequently, the efficiency of protein production for these two mRNAs is the same and therefore either may be selected without consequences for the level of protein production. The boundaries between ranges are determined by the number of “energy packets” (e.g., GTP, ATP and the like) hydrolyzed and the corresponding energy released. Thus, for example, the first range can correspond to zero GTP hydrolysis, the second range to 1 GTP hydrolysis, and so on, The boundaries can be variable to some degree and there are some overlapping between neighboring ranges because (1) the energy released from the hydrolysis varies with temperature and in vivo aquatic and ionic environment and (2) the calculation of MFE for mRNAs can be approximate. Generally, the boundaries are calculated by experiment and mRNAs near the boundaries are avoided. As described herein, the equation for calculating MFE is known in the art (i, ℮.,, eA(-E/'kT))/Z, where Ε is the minimum free energy of the structure, k is the Boltzmann constant, '1' is the temperature and Ζ is the partition function (Wuchty et al., Biopolymers 49:145-165 (1999)) Accordingly, in some embodiments, a mRNA can be selected from among a group of mRNAs in a given array having an MFE RNA secondary structure value in a range from about 0 kcal/mol to about -2 kcal/mol, in a range from about -2 kcal/mol to about -9 kcal/mol, or in a range from about -9 kcal/mol to about -18 kcal/mol. The choice of which group to select from mil depend on the level of protein production desired. Thus, in some embodiments, when enhanced protein production is desired, the mRNA can be selected from a group of mRNAs having an MFE RNA secondary structure value in a range from about 0 kcal/mol to about -2 kcal/mol. Therefore, a mRNA can be selected that has a MFE value of about 0 kcal/mol, -0,1 kcal/mol, -0.2 kcal/mol, -0.3 kcal/mol, -0.4 kcal/mol, -0.5 kcal/mol, -0,6 kcal/mol, -0.7 kcal/mol, -0.9 kcal/mol, -1 kcal/mol, -1.1 kcal/mol, -1.2 kcal/mol, -1.3 kcal/mol, -1.4 kcal/mol, -1.5 kcal/mol, -1.6cal/mol, -1.7 kcal/mol, -1.8 kcal/mol, -1.9 kcal/mol, -2 kcal/mol, and the like. In other embodiments, when reduced protein production is desired, the mRNA can be selected from a group of mRNAs having an MFE RNA secondary structure value in a range from about -9 kcal/mol to about -18 kcal/mol. In some embodiments, when reduced protein production is desired, the mRNA can be selected from a group of mRNAs having an MFE RNA secondary structure value in a range from about -9 kcal/mol to about -23 kcal/mol. In other embodiments, when reduced protein production is desired, the mRNA can be selected from a group of mRNAs having an MFE RNA secondary structure value in a range from about -9 kcal/mol to about -30 kcal/mol. Thus, in some embodiments, when reduced protein production is desired, a mRNA can be selected that has a MFE value of about -9 kcal/mol, -9.1 kcal/mol, -9.2 kcal/mol, -9.3 kcal/mol, -9.4 kcal/mol, -9.5 kcal/mol, -9,6 kcal/mol, -9.7 kcal/mol, -9.9 kcal/mol, -10 kcal/mol, -10.1 kcal/mol, -10.2 kcal/mol, -10.3 kcal/mol, -10.4 kcal/mol, -10.5 kcal/mol, -10.6cal/mol, -10.7 kcal/mol, -10.8 kcal/mol, -10.9 kcal/mol, -11 kcal/mol, -11.1 kcal/mol, -11.2 kcal/mol, -11.3 kcal/mol, -11.4 kcal/mol, -11.5 kcal/mol, -11.6cal/mol, -11.7 kcal/mol, -11.8 kcal/mol, -11.9 kcal/mol, -12 kcal/mol, -12.1 kcal/mol, -12.2 kcal/mol, -12.3 kcal/mol, -12.4 kcal/mol, -12.5 kcal/mol, -12.6cal/mol, -12.7 kcal/mol, -12.8 kcal/mol, -12.9 kcal/mol, -13 kcal/mol, -13.1 kcal/mol, -13.2 kcal/mol, -13.3 kcal/mol, -13.4 kcal/mol, -13.5 kcal/mol, -13.6cal/mol, -13.7 kcal/mol, -13.8 kcal/mol, -13.9 kcal/mol, -14 kcal/mol, -14.1 kcal/mol, -14.2 kcal/mol, -14.3 kcal/mol, -14.4 kcal/mol, -14.5 kcal/mol, -14.6cal/mol, -14.7 kcal/mol, -14.8 kcal/mol, -14.9 kcal/mol, -15 kcal/mol, -15.1 kcal/mol, -15.2 kcal/mol, -15.3 kcal/mol, -15.4 kcal/mol, -15.5 kcal/mol, -15,6cal/mol, -15.7 kcal/mol, -15.8 kcal/mol, -15.9 kcal/mol, -16 kcal/mol, -16.1 kcal/mol, -16.2 kcal/mol, -16.3 kcal/mol, -16.4 kcal/mol, -16.5 kcal/mol, -16.6cal/mol, -16.7 kcal/mol, -16.8 kcal/mol, -16.9 kcal/mol, -17 kcal/mol, -17.1 kcal/mol, -17.2 kcal/mol, -17.3 kcal/mol, -17.4 kcal/mol, -17.5 kcal/mol, -17.6cal/mol, -17.7 kcal/mol, -17.8 kcal/mol, -17.9 kcal/mol, -18 kcal/mol, -18.1 kcal/mol, -18.2 kcal/mol, -18.3 kcal/mol, -18.4 kcal/mol, -18.5 kcal/mol, -18.6cal/mol, -18.7 kcal/mol, -18.8 kcal/mol, -18.9 kcal/mol, -19 kcal/mol, -19.5 kcal/mol, -20 kcal/mol, -20.5 kcal/mol, -21 kcal/mol, -21.5 kcal/mol, -22 kcal/mol, -22.5 kcal/mol, -23 kcal/mol, -23.5 kcal/mol, -24 cal/mol, -24.5 kcal/mol, -25 kcal/mol, -25,5 kcal/mol, -26 kcal/mol, -26.5 kcal/mol, -27 kcal/mol, -27.5 kcal/mol, -28.5 kcal/mol, -29 kcal/mol, -29.5 kcal/mol, -30 kcal/mol, and the like. In still other embodiments, depending on the desired level of expression, the mRNA can be selected from a group of mRNAs having an MFE RNA secondary structure value in a range from about -2 kcal/mol to about -9 kcal/mol. Thus, a mRNA can be selected that has a MFE value of about -2 kcal/mol, -2.1 kcal/mol, -2.2 kcal/mol, -2.3 kcal/mol, -2.4 kcal/mol, -2.5 kcal/mol, -2.6 kcal/mol, -2.7 kcal/mol, -2,9 kcal/mol, -3 kcal/mol, -3.1 kcal/mol, -3.2 kcal/mol, -3.3 kcal/mol, -3.4 kcal/mol, -3.5 kcal/mol, -3.6cal/mol, -3.7 kcal/mol, -3.8 kcal/mol, -3.9 kcal/mol, -4 kcal/mol, -4.1 kcal/mol, -4.2 kcal/mol, -4.3 kcal/mol, -4.4 kcal/mol, -4.5 kcal/mol, -4.6cal/mol, -4.7 kcal/mol, -4.8 kcal/mol, -4.9 kcal/mol, -5 kcal/mol. -5.1 kcal/mol, -5.2 kcal/mol, -5.3 lccal/mol, -5.4 kcal/mol, -5.5 kcal/mol, -5,6cal/mol, -5.7 kcal/mol, -5,8 kcal/mol, -5,9 kcal/mol, -6 kcal/mol, -6.1 kcal/mol, -6.2 kcal/mol, -6.3 kcal/mol, -6.4 kcal/mol, -6.5 kcal/mol, -6.6cal/mol, -6.7 kcal/mol, -6.8 kcal/mol, -6.9 kcal/mol, -7 kcal/mol, -7.1 kcal/mol, -7.2 kcal/mol, -7.3 kcal/mol, -7.4 kcal/mol, -7.5 kcal/mol, -7.6cal/mol, -7.7 kcal/mol, -7.8 kcal/mol, -7.9 kcal/mol, -8 kcal/mol, -8.1 kcal/mol, -8.2 kcal/mol, -8.3 kcal/mol, -8.4 kcal/mol, -8.5 kcal/mol, -8.6cal/mol, -8.7 kcal/mol, -8.8 kcal/mol, -8.9 kcal/mol, -9 kcal/mol, and the like.

Thus, when selecting a mRNA for reduced production of a polypeptide of interest and ΒΡΡ is determined and used in ranking the individual mRNA sequences of the array according to a joint distribution, then the mRNA is selected from among about 0.0001% to about 20% of sequences in the ranked array with the lowest values for ΒΡΡ. Thus, in additional aspects of the invention, when selecting a mRNA for reduced production of polypeptide of interest, the mRNA can be selected from among about 0.0001% to about 10%, about 1% to about 10%, about 5% to about 15%, about 10% to about 15%, about 10% to about 20%, about the 15% to about 20%, or any combination thereof, of the mRNA sequences in the ranked array with the lowest values for ΒΡΡ. In other embodiments, when selecting a mRNA for reduced production of polypeptide of interest, the mRNA is selected from among about 0.0001%, 0.0005%, 0.001%, 0.005%, 0.01%, 0.05%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 9%, 10%, 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%, 16%, 17%, 18%, 19%, 20%, or any combination e thereof, of the mRNA sequences in the ranked array with the lowest values for ΒΡΡ. The selected mRNAs of the present invention can be further modified for protein production. As an example, the base pairing in and/or around the start codon (AUG) of a selected mRNA coding for the polypeptide of interest can be further modified to make the start codon of the selected mRNA more open (e.g., having fewer or no base pairings for enhanced protein production/translation initiation) or less open (e.g, having more base pairings for decreased protein production/translation initiation). The amount of base pairing of the start codon of the selected mRNA (i.e., more or less open) is in comparison to the start codon of the wild-type (native) mRNA that encodes for the polypeptide of interest or in comparison to the start codon of a second mRNA that encodes the polypeptide (other than the selected mRNA (e.g., first mRNA)). In further embodiments of the present invention, the selected mRNAs of the present invention can be combined with other factors that modify protein production such as transcription and translation enhancers. In some embodiments of this invention, to achieve the desired level of protein production, the selected mRNA sequences are further altered (i.e., mutated) so that the encoded amino acid sequence of the polypeptide of interest is mutated to incorporate one or more nonconsequential mutations (e.g., one or more conservative amino acid substitutions), which result in a desired change in the MFE value of the mRNA and a corresponding desired change in the level of protein production. Thus, while the mutated mRNA sequence encodes a mutated amino acid sequence, the mutation in the amino acid sequence does not alter the function of the polypeptide as compared to the wild type polypeptide sequence. Thus, in some embodiments of the present invention, a method for modi fying the production of a polypeptide of interest in a cell of an organism is provided, the method comprising: (a) selecting an mRNA encoding a polypeptide of interest according to any of the preceding claims; (b) mutating the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA of (a) to produce a mutated mRNA having an enhanced or reduced MFE RNA secondary structure as compared to the MFE RNA secondary structure of the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA of (a)) and encoding a polypeptide sequence that is mutated compared to the polypeptide sequence encoded by the mRNA of (a); wherein the mutated polypeptide sequence retains the function of the polypeptide encoded by the mRNA of (a), and expression of the mutated mRNA sequence in a cell of an organism results in modified production of the polypeptide of interest as compared to the wild-type mRNA sequence. Conservative or nonconseqncntial mutations include point mutations (replacement of a single base nucleotide with another nucleotide). The types of point mutations that can result in nonconsequential mutations (i.e., do not affect function) are well known in the art (See, e.g., D. Bordo and Ρ. Argos, Suggestions for “Safe” Residue Substitutions in Site-Directed Mutagensis, J. Mol. Biol. 217:721-729 (1991); Figure 2). Thus, for example, an array of mRNA sequences can be generated in which conservative point mutations are introduced into the mRNA sequence and from this array a mRNA having a desired MFE value and encoding a polypeptide that is mutated but retains the wild type function (e,g., nonconsequential mutation) can be selected. Thus, the MFE of a selected mRNA of the present invention can be further manipulated by mutating the sequence of the mRNA with the mutation resulting in a nonconsequential mutation in the polypeptide. Such mutations provide additional flexibility in choice of mRN A sequence for use in achieving a desired level of protein production, In further embodiments, the polypeptide of interest may be further optimized by using preferred codons for improved expression in a particular organism of interest, or may be synthesized using codons at a preferred codon usage frequency. Thus, in some embodiments, the GC content of the gene will be increased. See, e.g., Campbell & Gowri (1990) Plant Physiol. 92:1-11 for a discussion of host-preferred codon usage. Alternatively, rare codons, which are known to impeded or slow translation, can be useful for modulating (e.g., reducing) protein production relative to the protein production of a wild-type mRNA or another selected mRNA. Rare codons are determined based on the particular species (i,e., particular codons may be rare in one species but not rare in another species). Thus, as used herein, a “rare codon” is a codon that is encoded by a tRNA having an abundance of less than about 15% of the total tRNAs that code for a particular amino acid in a particular species or cell-type within a species. Accordingly, in some embodiments of this invention, the individual mRNA sequences selected according to the methods of this invention can comprise one or more rare codons near the start codon. Alternatively, in other embodiments of this invention mRNA sequences comprising rare codons can be eliminated from the array. Elimination of sequences comprising rare codons can be done using software programs. As used herein, “near the start codon” means those codons encoding the first 12 amino acids (AUG to + 12 amino acids). On the polypeptide level, “near the start codon” comprises nucleotide 1 to + 36. As used herein, "a," "an" or "the" can mean one or more than one. For example, "a" cell can mean a single cell or a multiplicity of cells. As used herein, "and/or" refers to and encompasses any and all possible combinations of one or more of the associated listed items, as well as the lack of combinations when interpreted in the alternative ("or"). Furthermore, the term "about," as used herein when referring to a measurable value such as an amount of a compound (e.g., mRNA) or agent of this invention, dose, time, percentage, temperature, and the like, is meant to encompass variations of + 20%, ± 10%, + 5%, ± 1%, ± 0.5%, or even + 0.1% of the specified amount. As used herein, the term "polypeptide" encompasses both peptides and proteins, unless indicated otherwise. As used herein, an "isolated" polypeptide or polypeptide fragment means a polypeptide or polypeptide fragment separated or substantially free from at least some of the other components of the naturally occurring organism, for example, the cellular components or other polypeptides or nucleic acids commonly found associated with the polypeptide. As used herein, the transitional phrase "consisting essentially of1 means that the scope of a claim is to be interpreted to encompass the specified materials or steps recited in the claim and those that do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristic(s) of the claimed invention. Thus, the term "consisting essentially of' when used in a claim of this invention is not intended to be interpreted to be equivalent to "comprising." The terms "reduce," "reduced," "reducing," "reduction," "diminish," and "decrease" (and grammatical variations thereof), as used herein, describe a decrease in the production of a polypeptide of interest encoded by a selected mRNA. This decrease can be observed by comparing the production of a polypeptide of interest by the selected mRNA to the production of the polypeptide of interest by the wild-type (i.e., native) mRNA that encodes for the same polypeptide of interest or by comparing the production of a polypeptide of interest by the selected mRNA to the production of the polypeptide by another (second) mRNA (other than the selected (first) mRNA) that encodes the same polypeptide of interest as encoded by the selected mRNA. The terms "enhance," "enhanced," "enhancing," "enhancement," and "increase," (and grammatical variations thereof), as used herein, describe an increase in the production of polypeptide of interest encoded by a selected mRNA. This increase can be observed by comparing the production of a polypeptide of interest by the selected mRNA to the production of the polypeptide of interest by the wild-type (i.e., native) mRNA that encodes for the same polypeptide of interest as encoded by the selected mRNA or by comparing the production of a polypeptide of interest by the selected mRNA to the production of the polypeptide by another (second) mRNA (other than the selected (first) mRNA) that encodes the same polypeptide of interest as encoded by the selected mRNA. The term "modulate," "modulates," modulated” or "modulation” refers to enhancement (e.g-, an increase) or inhibition (e.g., a reduction) in the specified activity (e.g., modulated protein production). A polypeptide of interest can be any polypeptide. Non-limiting examples of polypeptides of interest that are suitable for expression in plants include those resulting in agronomically important, traits such as herbicide resistance, virus resistance, bacterial pathogen resistance, insect resistance, nematode resistance, and fungal resistance. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,569,823; 5,304,730; 5,495,071; 6,329,504; and 6,337,431. The polypeptide of interest may also be one that results in increases in plant vigor or yield (including polypeptides that allow a plant to grow at different temperatures, soil conditions and levels of sunlight and precipitation), or one that allows identification of a plant exhibiting a trait of interest (e.g.. selectable marker gene, seed coat color, etc.). Herbicide resistance is also sometimes referred to as herbicide tolerance. Genes conferring resistance to an herbicide that inhibits the growing point or meristem, such as an imidazalinone or a sulfonylurea can be suitable, Exemplary genes in this category code for mutant ALS and AHAS enzymes as described, e.g., in U.S, Patent Nos. 5,767,366 and 5,928,937. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,761,373 and 5,013,659 are directed to plants resistant to various imidazalinone or sulfonamide herbicides. U.S. Patent No. 4,975,374 relates to plant cells and plants containing a gene encoding a mutant glutamine synthetase (GS) resistant to inhibition by herbicides that are known to inhibit GS, e.g., phosphinothricin and methionine sulfoximine. U.S, Patent No. 5,162,602 discloses plants resistant to inhibition by cyclohexanedione and aryloxyphenoxypropanoic acid herbicides. The resistance is conferred by an altered acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase). Polypeptides of interest encoded by genes for resistance to glyphosate are also suitable. See, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 4,940,835 and U.S, Patent No, 4,769,061. U.S. Patent No. 5,554,798 discloses transgenic glyphosate resistant maize plants, which resistance is conferred by an altered 5-enolpyruvyl-3-phosphoshikimate (EPSP) synthase gene. Genes for resistance to phosphono compounds such as glufosinate ammonium or phosphinothricin, and pyridinoxy or phenoxy propionic acids and cyclohexones are also suitable. See, European Patent Application No. 0 242 246. See also, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,879,903, 5,276,268 and 5,561,236. Other suitable herbicides include those that inhibit photosynthesis, such as a triazine and a benzonitrile (nitrilase). See, U.S. Patent No. 4,810,648. Other suitable herbicides include 2,2-dichloropropionic acid, sethoxydim, haloxyfop, imidazolinone herbicides, sulfonylurea herbicides, triazolopyrimidine herbicides, s-triazine herbicides and bromoxynil. Also suitable are genes that confer resistance to a protox enzyme, or provide enhanced resistance to plant diseases; enhanced tolerance of adverse environmental conditions (abiotic stresses) including but not limited to drought, excessive cold, excessive heat, or excessive soil salinity or extreme acidity or alkalinity; and alterations in plant architecture or development, including changes in developmental timing. See, e.g., U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2001/0016956 and U.S. Patent No. 6,084,155. The insecticidal proteins useful for the invention may be expressed in an amount sufficient to control insect pests, i.e., insect controlling amounts. It is recognized that the amount of expression of insecticidal protein in a plant necessary to control insects may vary depending upon the cultivar, type of insect, environmental factors and the like. Genes useful for insect or pest resistance include, for example, genes encoding toxins identified in Bacillus organisms. Genes encoding Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins from several subspecies have been cloned and recombinant clones have been found to be toxic to lepidopteran, dipteran and coleopteran insect larvae (for example, various delta-endotoxin genes such as CrylAa, CrylAb, CrylAc, CrylB, CrylC, CryJD, CrylEa, CrylFa, Cry3A, Cry9A, Cry9C and Cry9B\ as well as genes encoding vegetative insecticidal proteins such as Vipl, Vip2 and Vip3). A full list of Bt toxins can be found on the worldwide web at Bacillus thuringiensis Toxin Nomenclature Database maintained by the University of Sussex (see also, Crickmore et αℓ. (1998) Microbiol Mol. Biol. Rev. 62:807-813). Polypeptides of interest that are suitable for expression in plants further include those that improve or otherwise facilitate the conversion of harvested cane into a commercially useful product, including, for example, increased or altered carbohydrate content and/or distribution, improved fermentation properties, increased oil content, increased protein content, improved digestibility, and increased nutraceutical content, e.g., increased phytosterol content, increased tocopherol content, increased stand content or increased vitamin content. Polypeptides of interest also include, for example, those resulting in or contributing to a reduced content of an unwanted component in a harvested crop, e.g., phytic acid, or sugar degrading enzymes. By "resulting in" or "contributing to" is intended that the polypeptide of interest can directly or indirectly contribute to the existence of a trait of interest (e.g., increasing cellulose degradation by the heterologous expression of a cellulase enzyme). In one embodiment, the polypeptide of interest contributes to improved digestibility for food or feed. Xylanases are hemicellulolytic enzymes that improve the breakdown of plant cell walls, which leads to better utilization of the plant nutrients by the animal. This leads to improved growth rate and feed conversion. Also, the viscosity of the feeds containing xylan can be reduced. Expression of xylanases in plant ceils also can also potentially act to facilitate lignocellulosic conversion to fermentable sugars in industrial processing. Numerous xylanases from fungal and bacterial microorganisms have been identified and characterized (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,437,992; Coughlin et αℓ. (1993) "Proceedings of the Second TRICEL Symposium on Trichoderma reesei Ceilulases and Other Hydrolases," Espoo; Souminen and Reinikainen, eds. (1993) Foundation for Biotechnical and Industrial Fermentation Research 8:125-135; U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0208178; and WO 03/16654). In particular, three specific xylanases (XYL-I, XYL-II, and XYL-III) have been identified in Τ, reesei (Tenkanen et at. (1992) Enzyme Microb. Technol 14:566; Torronen et αℓ. (1992) Bio/Technology 10:1461 ; and Xu el αℓ. (1998) Λρρℓ. Microbiol. Bio technol. 49:718). In another embodiment, the polypeptide of interest is a polysaccharide degrading enzyme. Such plants may be useful for generating, for example, fermentation feedstocks for bioprocessing. In some embodiments, the enzymes useful for fermentation process include alpha amylases, proteases, pullulanases, isoamylases, ceilulases, hemicellulases, xylanases, cyclodextrin glycotransferases, lipases, phytases, laccases, oxidases, esterases, cutinases, granular starch hydrolyzing enzyme and other glucoamylases. Polysaccharide-degrading enzymes include: starch degrading enzymes such as αamylases (EC 3,2.1.1), glucuronidases (E.C. 3.2.1.131); exo-l,4-a-D glucanases such as amyloglucosidases and glucoamylase (EC 3.2.1.3), P-amylases (EC 3.2,1,2), a-glucosidases (EC 3.2.1.20), and other exo-amylases; and starch debranching enzymes, such as a) isoamylase (EC 3.2.1.68), pullulanase (EC 3.2.1.41), and the like; b) ceilulases such as exo-1,4-3-cellobiohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.91), cxo-1,3-[f-D-giucanase (EC 3.2.1.39), p-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.21); c) L-arabinases, such as endo-l,5-a-L-arabinase (EC 3.2.1.99), αarabinosidases (EC 3.2.1.55) and the like; d) galactanases such as endo-l,4-p-D-galactanase (EC 3.2.1.89), endo-l,3-p-D-galactanase (EC 3.2.1.90), a-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.22), βgalactosidase (EC 3.2,1.23) and the like; ℮) mannanases, such as endo-l,4-p-D-mannanase (EC 3.2.1.78), p-maimosidase (EC 3.2.1.25). a-mannosidase (EC 3.2.1.24) and the like; f) xylanases, such as endo-l,4-p-xylanase (EC 3.2,1.8), p-D-xylosidase (EC 3.2.1.37), 1,3-β-Ε)xylanase, and the like; g) other enzymes such as a-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2,1.51), a-Lrhamnosidase (EC 3.2.1.40), levanase (EC 3,2.1.65), inulanase (EC 3.2.1.7), and the like. Further additional enzymes which may be used include proteases, such as fungal and bacterial proteases. Fungal proteases include, but are not limited to, those obtained from Aspergillus, Trichoderma, Mucor and Rhizopus, such as A. niger, A. awamori, A. oryzae and Μ. miehei. In some embodiments, the polypeptides of interest are cellobioliydrolase (CBH) enzymes (EC 3,2.1.91). In one embodiment, the cellobiohydrolase enzyme is CBH1 or CBH2, Other enzymes (polypeptides of interest) include, but are not limited to, hemicellulases, such as mannases and arabinofuranosidases (EC 3.2.1.55); ligninases; lipases (e.g., E.C. 3.1.1,3), glucose oxidases, pectinases, xylanases, transglucosidases, alpha 1,6 glucosidases (e.g., E.C. 3.2.1.20); esterases such as ferulic acid esterase (EC 3,1.1.73) and acetyl xylan esterases (EC 3.1.1.72); and cutinases (e.g. E.C. 3.1.1.74). In some embodiments of this invention, a polypeptide of interest further comprises a leader peptide. As is well known in the art, a leader peptide is a peptide that is encoded upstream (5' end of the coding sequence) of a larger open reading frame. Any leader peptide can be used with the methods of the present invention. A leader peptide can be a peptide that is found in nature or it can be a synthetic peptide designed to function as a leader peptide. Thus, in some embodiments of the present invention, a polypeptide of interest comprises a leader peptide, and thus the 5' end of the mRNA encoding the polypeptide of interest comprises a leader sequence encoding the leader peptide upstream (5' end of the coding sequence) of an open reading frame, t hus, in some embodiments, the array of individual mRN A sequences comprising different nucleotide sequences encoding the polypeptide of interest encode a leader sequence fused to the polypeptide of interest. In some embodiments, the producti on of a polypeptide of interest can be modulated through the modulation of the expression of a leader sequence fused to the polypeptide of interest. Thus, a mRNA encoding the leader peptide is selected according to any of the methods of the present invention and fused to the polypeptide of interest. By modulating the expression of the leader sequence, the expression of the polypeptide to which it is fused can be modulated. Thus, the expression of the polypeptide of interest can be modulated without altering the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide of interest or the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide of interest. Non-limiting examples of leader peptides include signal peptides, transit peptides, targeting peptides, signal sequences, and the like. As is well known in the art, signal/transit peptides target or transport a protein encoded by a nuclear gene to a particular organelle such as the mitochondrion, plastids (e.g., apicoplast, chromoplast, chloroplast, cyanelle, thylakoid, amylopiast, and the like), microbodies (e.g., single membrane-bounded small organelles, such as peroxisomes, hydrogenosomes, glyoxysomes and glycosome). Leader peptides are well known in the art and can be found in public databases such as the "Signal Peptide Website: An Information Platform for Signal Sequences and Signal Peptides." (www.signa.lpeptide.de); the "Signal Peptide Database" (proline.bic.nus.edu.sg/spdb/index.html) (Choo et aL BMC Bioinformatics 6:249 (2005)(available on www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/249/abstract); ChloroP (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/ChloroP/; predicts the presence of chloroplast transit peptides (℮ΤΡ) in protein sequences and the location of potential cTP cleavage sites); LipoP (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/LipoP/; predicts lipoproteins and signal peptides in Gram negative bacteria); MITOPROT (ihg2.helmhoItz-muenchen.de/ihg/mitoprot.html; predicts mitochondrial targeting sequences); PlasMit (gecco.org.chemie.unilrankfurt.de/plasmit/index.html; predicts mitochondrial transit peptides in Plasmodium falciparum)', Predotar (urgi.versailles.inra.fr/predotar/predotar.html; predicts mitochondrial andplastid targeting sequences); PTS1 (mendel.imp.ac.at/mendeljsp/sat/ptsl/PTSlpredictor.jsp; predicts peroxisomal targeting signal 1 containing proteins); SignalP (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/; predicts the presence and location of signal peptide cleavage sites in amino acid sequences from different organisms: Gram-positive prokaryotes, Gram-negative prokaryotes, and eukaryotes. The method incorporates a prediction of cleavage sites and a signal peptide/non-signal peptide prediction based on a combination of several artificial neural networks and hidden Markov models); and TargetP (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/); predicts the subcellular location of eukaryotic proteins - the location assignment is based on the predicted presence of any of the N-terminal presequences: chloroplast transit peptide (cTP), mitochondrial targeting peptide (mTP) or secretory pathway signal peptide (SP)).

The terms "nucleotide sequence" "nucleic acid," "nucleic acid molecule," "oligonucleotide" and "polynucleotide" are also used interchangeably herein to refer to a heteropolymer of nucleotides. Nucleic acids of this invention can comprise a nucleotide sequence that can be identical in sequence to the sequence which is naturally occurring (i.e., native or wild type) or, due to the well-characterized degeneracy of the nucleic acid code, can include alternative codons that encode the same amino acid as that which is found in the naturally occurring sequence. Furthermore, nucleic acids of this invention can comprise nucleotide sequences that can include codons which represent conservative substitutions of amino acids as are well known in the art, such that the biological activity of the resulting polypeptide and/or fragment is retained. A nucleic acid of this invention can be single or double stranded. Additionally, the nucleic acids of this invention can also include a nucleic acid strand that is partially complementary to a part of the nucleic acid sequence or completely complementary across the full length of the nucleic acid sequence. Nucleic acid sequences provided herein are presented herein in the 5’ to 3! direction, from left to right and are represented using the standard code for representing the nucleotide characters as set forth in the U.S. sequence rules, 37 CFR §§1.821 - 1.825 and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Standard ST.25. As used herein, the term "gene" refers to a nucleic acid molecule capable of being used to produce mRNA or antisense RNA. Genes may or may not be capable of being used to produce a functional protein. Genes can include both coding and non-coding regions (e.g., introns, regulatory elements, promoters, enhancers, termination sequences and 5' and 3' untranslated regions). A gene may be "isolated" by which is meant a nucleic acid that is substantially or essentially free from components normally found in association with the nucleic acid in its natural state. Such components include other cellular material, culture medium from recombinant production, and/or various chemicals used in chemically synthesizing the nucleic acid. An "isolated" nucleic acid of the present invention is generally free of nucleic acid sequences that flank the nucleic acid of interest in the genomic DNA of the organism from which the nucleic acid was derived (such as coding sequences present at the 5' or 3' ends). However, the nucleic acid of this invention can include some additional bases or moieties that do not deleteriously affect the basic structural and/or functional characteristics of the nucleic acid. "Isolated" does not mean that the preparation is technically pure (homogeneous). Thus, an "isolated nucleic acid" is a nucleotide sequence that is not immediately contiguous with nucleotide sequences with which it is immediately contiguous (one on the 5' end and one on the 3' end) in the naturally occurring genome of the organism lfom which it is derived. Accordingly, in one embodiment, an isolated nucleic acid includes some or all of the 5' non-coding (e.g,, promoter) sequences that are immediately contiguous to a coding sequence. The term therefore includes, for example, a recombinant nucleic acid that is incorporated into a vector, into an autonomously replicating plasmid or virus, or into the genomic DNA of a prokaryote or eukaryote, or which exists as a separate molecule (e.g., a cDNA or a genomic DNA fragment produced by PCR or restriction endonuclease treatment), independent of other sequences. It also includes a recombinant nucleic acid that is part of a hybrid nucleic acid encoding an additional polypeptide or peptide sequence. The term "transgene" as used herein, refers to any nucleic acid sequence used in the transformation of a plant, animal, or other organism. Thus, a transgene can be a coding sequence, a non-coding sequence, a cDNA, a gene or fragment or portion thereof, a genomic sequence, a regulatory element and the like. A "transgenic" organism, such as a transgenic plant, transgenic microorganism, or transgenic animal, is an organism into which a transgene has been delivered or introduced and the transgene can be expressed in the transgenic organism to produce a product, the presence of which can impart an effect and/or a phenotype in the organism. The terms "complementary" or "complementarity," as used herein, refer to the natural binding of polynucleotides under permissive salt and temperature conditions by base-pairing. For example, the sequence "A-G-T" binds to the complementary sequence "T-C-A." Complementarity between two single-stranded molecules may be "partial," in which only some of the nucleotides bind, or it may be complete when total complementarity exists between the single stranded molecules. The degree of complementarity between nucleic acid strands has significant effects on the efficiency and strength of hybridization between nucleic acid strands. Different nucleic acids or proteins having homology are referred to herein as "homologues," The term homologue includes homologous sequences from the same and other species and orthologous sequences from the same and other species. "Homology" refers to the level of similarity between two or more nucleic acid and/or amino acid sequences in terms of percent of positional identity (i.e., sequence similarity or identity). Homology also refers to the concept of similar functional properties among different nucleic acids or proteins. As used herein "sequence identity" refers to the extent to which two optimally aligned polynucleotide or peptide sequences are invariant throughout a window of alignment of components, e.g., nucleotides or amino acids, An "identity fraction" for aligned segments of a test sequence and a reference sequence is the number of identical components which are shared by the two aligned sequences divided by the total number of components in reference sequence segment, i.e,, the entire reference sequence or a smaller defined part of the reference sequence. As used herein, the term "percent sequence identity" or "percent identity" refers to the percentage of identical nucleotides in a linear polynucleotide sequence of a reference ("query") polynucleotide molecule (or its complementary strand) as compared to a test ("subject") polynucleotide molecule (or its complementary strand) when the two sequences are optimally aligned (with appropriate nucleotide insertions, deletions, or gaps totaling less than 20 percent of the reference sequence over the window of comparison). In some embodiments, "percent identity" can refer to the percentage of identical amino acids in an amino acid sequence. Optimal alignment of sequences for aligning a comparison window are well known to those skilled in the art and may be conducted by tools such as the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman, the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch, the search for similarity method of Pearson and Lipman, and optionally by computerized implementations of these algorithms such as GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA, and TFASTA available as part of the GCG® Wisconsin Package® (Accelrys Inc., Burlington, Mass.). An "identity fraction" for aligned segments of a test sequence and a reference sequence is the number of identical components which are shared by the two aligned sequences divided by the total number of components in the reference sequence segment, i. ℮., the entire reference sequence or a smaller defined part of the reference sequence. Percent sequence identity is represented as the identity fraction multiplied by 100. The comparison of one or more polynucleotide sequences may be to a full-length polynucleotide sequence or a portion thereof, or to a longer polynucleotide sequence. For purposes of this invention "percent identity" may also be determined using BLASTX version 2.0 for translated nucleotide sequences and BLASTN version 2.0 for polynucleotide sequences. The percent of sequence identity can be determined using the "Best Fit" or "Gap" program of the Sequence Analysis Software Package™ (Version 10; Genetics Computer Group, Inc., Madison, Wis.). "Gap" utilizes the algorithm of Needleman and Wunsch (Needleman and Wunsch, J Mol. Biol, 48:443-453, 1970) to find the alignment of two sequences that maximizes the number of matches and minimizes the number of gaps. "BestFit" performs an optimal alignment of the best segment of similarity between two sequences and inserts gaps to maximize the number of matches using the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (Smith and Waterman, Adv. Αρρℓ. Math, 2:482-489,1981, Smith et αℓ., Nucleic Acids Res. 11:2205-2220, 1983). Useful methods for determining sequence identity are also disclosed in Guide to Huge Computers (Martin J. Bishop, ed., Academic Press, San Diego (1994)), and Carillo, Η., and Lipton, D., {AppliedMath 48:1073(1988)). More particularly, preferred computer programs for determining sequence identity include but are not limited to the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) programs which are publicly available from National Center Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Library of Medicine, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md, 20894; see BLAST Manual, Altschul et αℓ., NCBI, NLM, NIH; (Altschul et αℓ., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 (1990)); version 2.0 or higher of BLAST programs allows the introduction of gaps (deletions and insertions) into alignments; for peptide sequence BLASTX can be used to determine sequence identity; and, for polynucleotide sequence BLASTN can be used to determine sequence identity. As used herein, the term "promoter" refers to a region of a nucleotide sequence that incorporates the necessary signals for the efficient expression of a coding sequence. This may include sequences to which an RNA polymerase binds, but is not limited to such sequences and can include regions to which other regulatory proteins bind together with regions involved in the control of protein translation and can also include coding sequences. Furthermore, a "promoter" of this invention is a promoter capable of initiating transcription in a cells of an organism of interest (e.g., animal, plant, microorganism). Such promoters include those that drive expression of a nucleotide sequence constitutively, those that drive expression when induced, and those that drive expression in a tissue- or developmentally-speciflc manner, as these various types of promoters are known in the art. The term "transformation" as used herein refers to the introduction of a heterologous nucleic acid into a cell. Transformation of a cell may be stable or transient. The term "transient transformation" or "transiently transformed" refers to the introduction of one or more heterologous nucleic acids into a cell wherein the heterologous nucleic acid is not heritable from one generation to another. "Stable transformation" or "stably transformed" refers to the integration of the heterologous nucleic acid into the genome of the organism or incorporation of the heterologous nucleic acid into the cell or cells of the organism (e.g., via a plasmid) such that the heterologous nucleic acid is heritable across repeated generations. Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention a stably transformed organism is produced. In other embodiments of the present invention a stably transformed plant is produced. Transient transformation may be detected by, for example, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or Western blot, which can detect the presence of a peptide or polypeptide encoded by one or more transgene introduced into an organism. Stable transformation of a cell can be detected by, for example, a Southern blot hybridization assay of genomic DNA of the cell with nucleic acid sequences which specifically hybridize with a nucleotide sequence of a transgene Introduced into an organism (e.g., a plant). Stable transformation of a cell can be detected by, for example, a Northern blot hybridization assay of RNA of the cell with nucleic acid sequences which specifically hybridize with a nucleotide sequence of a transgene introduced into a plant or other organism. Stable transformation of a cell can also be detected by, e.g., a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or other amplification reactions as are well known in the art, employing specific primer sequences that hybridize with target sequence(s) of a trans gene, resulting in amplification of the transgene sequence, which can be detected according to standard methods Transformation can also be detected by direct sequencing and/or hybridization protocols well known in the art. A nucleic acid (e.g., selected mRNA) of this invention can be introduced into a cell by any method known to those of skill in the art. In some embodiments of the present invention, transformation of a cell comprises nuclear transformation. In other embodiments, transformation of a cell comprises plastid transformation (e.g., chloroplast transformation). Thus, mRNAs selected according to the methods of the present invention can be used to transform any organism using methods know to those of skill in the art. Procedures for transforming a wide variety of organisms, including, but not limited to, a bacteria, a cyanobacteria, an animal, a plant, a fungus, and the like, are well known and routine in the art and are described throughout the literature. As an example, such methods for transformation of plants include, but are not limited to, transformation via bacterialmediated nucleic acid delivery {e.g., via Agrobacteria), viral-mediated nucleic acid delivery, silicon carbide or nucleic acid whisker-mediated nucleic acid delivery, liposome mediated nucleic acid delivery, microinjection, microparticle bombardment, electroporation, sonication, infiltration, PEG-mediated nucleic acid uptake, as well as any other electrical, chemical, physical (mechanical) and/or biological mechanism that results in the introduction of nucleic acid into the plant cell, including any combination thereof. General guides to various plant transformation methods known in the art include Miki et αℓ. ("Procedures for Introducing Foreign DNA into Plants" in Methods in Plant Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, Glick, Β. R. and Thompson, J. Ε., Eds. (CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, 1993), pages 67-88) and Rakowoczy-Trojanowska (Cell, Mol. Biol Lett. 7:849-858 (2002)). The term "vector" refers to a composition for transferring, delivering or introducing a nucleic acid (or nucleic acids) into a cell. A vector comprises a nucleic acid comprising the nucleotide sequence to be transferred, delivered or introduced. In some embodiments, a vector of this invention can be a viral vector, which can comprise, e.g., a viral capsid and/or other materials for facilitating entry of the nucleic acid into a cell and/or replication of the nucleic acid of the vector in the cell (e.g., reverse transcriptase or other enzymes which are packaged within the capsid, or as part of the capsid). The viral vector can be an infectious virus particle that delivers nucleic acid into a cell following infection of the cell by the virus particle. Thus, in particular embodiments of the present invention, a plant cell can be transformed by any method known in the art and as described herein and intact plants can be regenerated from these transformed cells using any of a variety of known techniques, Plant regeneration from plant cells, plant tissue culture and/or cultured protoplasts is described, for example, in Evans etal (Handbook of Plant Cell Cultures, Vol. 1, MacMilan Publishing Co. New York (1983)); and Vasil I. R. (ed.) (Cell Culture and Somatic Cell Genetics of Plants, Acad. Press, Orlando, Vol. I (1984), and Vol. II (1986)). Methods of selecting for transformed transgenic plants, plant cells and/or plant tissue culture are routine in the art and can be employed in the methods of the invention provided herein. Thus, in some embodiments of this invention, a mRNA encoding a polypeptide of interest selected using the methods described herein can be introduced into a eukaryotic cell to produce a transgenic eukaryotic cell or transgenic eukaryotic organism that thereby produces an enhanced or diminished amount of the polypeptide of interest as compared to the amount of protein produced by the wild-type (i.e., native) mRNA encoding the same polypeptide of interest as the mRNA selected according to the methods of this invention. In other embodiments of this invention, a first mRNA encoding a polypeptide of interest selected using the methods described herein can be introduced into a eukaryotic cell to produce a transgenic eukaryotic cell or transgenic eukaryotic organism that thereby produces an enhanced or diminished amount of the polypeptide of interest as compared to the amount of protein produced by a second mRNA selected using the methods described herein and encoding the same polypeptide of interest as the first mRNA. In further embodiments, a mRNA encoding a polypeptide of interest selected using the methods described herein can be used as described herein to modify (enhance or reduce) the protein production of an endogenous nucleotide sequence (e.g., present in the genome) encoding the same polypeptide of interest as that encoded by the mRNA that is selected using the methods described herein. Thus, in some embodiments of this invention, a method for modifying the production of a polypeptide of interest in a cell of an organism is provided, the method comprising: (a) selecting a mRNA encoding a polypeptide of interest according to the methods of this invention; (b) identifying the differences between the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA selected according to (a) and a wild-type endogenous nucleotide sequence of said organism, wherein the wild-type endogenous nucleotide sequence encodes a polypeptide of interest that is the same as that encoded by the mRNA selected according to (a); and (c) mutating in situ the endogenous nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide of interest to incorporate each of the nucleotide differences identified in (b) into the endogenous nucleotide sequence, whereby the production of the polypeptide of interest from the in situ mutated endogenous nucleotide sequence in the cell of the organism is modified. Methods of in situ modification of nucleotide sequences are known in the art. Thus, for example, zinc finger nucleases can be used as described by Cai et al. {Plant Mol Biol 69(6):699-709 (20()9)) to drive site directed DNA integration into native nucleotide sequences. Gene targeting and genomic DNA modification may also be accomplished through use of activator-like (TAL) effector nucleases as is known by those skilled in the art. WO 10054348, Shornack, S. et al.

In some embodiments, systems and/or computer program products for carrying out the methods described herein are provided. Accordingly, the present invention is described below with reference to block diagrams and/or flowchart illustrations of methods, apparatus (systems) and/or computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It is understood that each block of the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustrations, and combinations of blocks in the block diagrams and/or flowchart illustrations, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, and/or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer and/or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions/acts specified in the block diagrams and/or flowchart block or blocks.

As illustrated in Fig. 1, operations according to some embodiments of the present invention include producing an array of mRNA sequences encoding a polypeptide of interest (Block 10). For example, an input amino acid sequence is selected and using a random sampling procedure nucleotide sequences encoding the input amino acid sequence are generated. Thermodynamic parameters are determined for each individual mRNA sequence in the array (Block 20), The parameter data is provided for each of the individual mRNA sequences of the array (Block 30). The individual mRNA sequences are ranked according to the value determined for each parameter (Block 40). In the case when more than one parameter is determined the ranking is according to a joint distribution of the parameters. A mRNA sequence is selected from the ranked mRNA sequences based on the level of protein production desired (Block 50). A desired level of protein production can be any level of protein production including greatly enhanced, enhanced, moderately enhanced, moderately reduced or reduced or greatly reduced protein production. As illustrated in Fig. 2, a data processing system includes a processor 110. The processor 110 communicates with the memory 114 via an address/databus 148. The processor 110 can be any commercially available or custom microprocessor. The memory 114 is representative of the overall hierarchy of memory devices containing the software and data used to implement the functionality of the data processing system 100. The memory 114 can include, but is not limited to, the following types of devices: cache, ROM, PROM, EPROM, EEPROM, flash memory, SRAM, and DRAM. As shown in Fig. 2, the memory 114 may include several categories of software and data used in the data processing system: the application programs 140, the operating system 142; the input/output (I/O) device drivers 148; and the data 146. The application programs 140 can include a mRNA selection module 150 and/or a mRNA array production module 152. In the mRNA array production module 152, an input amino acid sequence may be used to generate an array of mRNA sequences encoding the input amino acid sequence. In the mRNA selection module 150, mRNAs may be ranked based on the values for the parameters determined for the individual mRNAs of the array, and a mRNA may be selected based on the desired level of protein production. The data 146 may include the parameter data determined for individual mRNA sequences for an array 160 and the distribution of the individual mRNAs in the array 162. The mRNA selection module 150 and the mRNA array production module 152 can be configured to carry out the operations discussed in Fig. 1. As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, the operating system 152 shown in Fig. 2 may be any operating system suitable for use with a data processing system, such as OS/2, ΑΕΧ, OS/390 or System390 from International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, NY, Windows CE, WindowsNT, Windows95, Windows98, Windows2000 or WindowsXP from Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, Unix or Linux or FreeBSD, Mac OS from Apple Computer, or proprietary operating systems. The I/O device drivers 148 typically include software routines accessed through die operating system 142 by the application programs 144 to communicate with devices such as I/O data port(s), data 146 and certain components of the memory 114 and/or the histology slide imaging system 120. The application programs 140 are illustrative of the programs that implement the various features of the data processing system 100 and can include at least one application which supports operations according to embodiments of the present invention. Finally, the data 140 represents the static and dynamic data used by the application programs 140, the operating system 142, the I/O device drivers 148, and other software programs that may reside in the memory 114, While the present invention is illustrated, for example, with reference to the mRNA selection module 150 and the mRNA array production module 152 being application program in Fig. 2, as will he appreciated by those of skill in the art, other configurations may also be utilized according to embodiments of the present invention. For example, the mRNA selection module 150 may also be incorporated into the operating system 142, the I/O device drivers 148 or other such logical division of the data processing system 100. Thus, the present invention should not be construed as limited to the configuration of Fig. 2, which is intended to encompass any configuration capable of carrying out the operations described herein. The I/O data port can be used to transfer information between the data processing system 100 and another computer system or a network (e.g,, the Internet) or to other devices controlled by the processor. These components may be conventional components such as those used in many conventional data processing systems that may be configured in accordance with the present invention to operate as described herein. Therefore, the mRNA selection module 150 can be used to analyze the parameter data determined for individual mRNA sequences for an array 160 and the distribution of individual mRNAs in the array 162 that has been previously collected. The present invention will now be described with reference to the following examples. It should be appreciated that this example is for the purpose of illustrating aspects of the present invention, and does not limit the scope of the invention as defined by the claims.

Example 2. Methods for generation of RNA folding energies for potential sequences encoding a given amino acid sequence Starting with an input amino acid sequence, BioPerl was used to automate a random sampling procedure that generated nucleotide sequences encoding the input amino acid sequences. (Stajich et al. Genome Res 12(10): 1611 -8 (2002)). For each position in the amino acid sequence, codons for that position were selected by sampling the possible codons from a uniform distribution. Ten thousand nucleotide sequences were generated in this manner for each input amino acid sequence. Each output nucleotide sequence was checked for length and translation to ensure die accuracy of the sampling procedure. The ViennaRNA package version 1.8.2 was used to calculate for each input sequence the minimum free energy, ensemble free energy, and frequency of the MFE structure in the ensemble. (Hofackeret al. Monatshefie f. Chemie 125: 167-188 (1994); www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/). The parameter settings for calculation were "-p0 -d2," which turns on calculation of the partition function and ensures that the partition function and the minimum free energy treat dangling end energies in the same manner. Calculation of the energies was executed on the in-house Linux cluster. Histograms of the resulting energy distributions were plotted using R. (R Development Core Team. R: A language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria (2009); ISBN 3-900051-07-0; www.R-project.org). Example 3. Selection of mRNA variants (both enhanced and reduced protein production) The Anemonia majano cyan fluorescent protein (AmCyan reporter gene) with Ν-terminal chloroplast targeting signal polypeptide from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was chosen as the polypeptide of interest. Selected mRNA variants were synthesized by GENEART® (Germany). Variants of the AmCyan nucleotide seqence were generated by replacing the coding sequence of the 5' region (Ν-terminal region of the encoded polypeptide). Thus, in this particular example, 40 nucleotides from the 5' end of the nucleotide sequence of the N-terminal signal peptide (upstream of AmCyan reporter sequence) were replaced with the sequences (variants) set forth in Table 2 and/or Table 3, below. Construct for tobacco transformation and protein expression. A nucleic acid construct encoding the AmCyan nucleotide sequence (CFP) fused with the nucleotide sequence of a ssRubisco chloroplast transit peptide was used to transform tobacco. The nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID ΝΟ:1) of the construct and the amino acid sequence (SEQ ID ΝΟ:2) encoded by the construct are shown below.

Plant Transformation and Expression Expression vectors capable of directing the expression of the variants were designed as described above. SEQ ID ΝΟ:1 and Table 2 provide the sequences of the variants. The constitutive CaMV 35S promoter was used to drive expression of the dicot optimized variant genes, The tobacco expressed reporter protein, AmCyan, was targeted to the chloroplast via fusion to the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii small sub-unit Rubisco transit peptide sequence. Tobacco expression vectors used the binary vector, pGR106, containing potato virus X (PVX) amplicon (Lu et al., 2003, ΕΜΒΟ J, 22:5690-5699). It is noted that similar vectors can be constructed for transformation and expression in other expression systems. All expression cassettes are sub-cloned into a binary vector for transformation into tobacco using recombinant DNA techniques that are known in the art. The expression vector can also contain a protoporphyrinogen oxidase (ΡΡΟ) selection marker driven by the same promoter, hence ΡΡΟ can serve as an internal control. Transient expression in tobacco leaves. Expression cassettes were cloned into either a binary vector or a binary vector also containing an origin of replication from beet curly top virus (BCTV). The binary vectors without the origin of replication from BCTV were transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 using the freeze-thaw method (An et al., "Binary vector". In: Gelvin SB, Schilproot RA (eds), Plant molecular biology manual. Kluwar Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, ρρ A3 1-19 (1988)). The binary vectors containing the origin of replication from BCTV (BCTV binary vectors) were transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 containing a helper plasmid that contains a replicase sequence from BCTV also using the freeze-thaw method as described herein. Tobacco leaves were used for the transient expression of target proteins in plant tissue. Tobacco leaves from transgenic TEV-B tobacco plants (made in the tobacco cultivar Xanthi) containing a mutated Pl/HC-Pro gene from TEV that suppresses post-transcriptional gene silencing (Mallory et al., Nat Biotechnol 20:622 (2002)) were used for transient expression of selected enzymes. Preparation of Agrobacterium cultures and infiltration of tobacco was carried out as described by Azhakanandam et al. {Plant Mot. Biol. 63: 393-404 (2007)). In brief, the genetically modified agrobacteria were grown overnight in 50 mL of LB medium containing 100μΜ acetosyringone and 10μΜ MES (pH 5.6). The agrobacteria were then pelleted by centrifugation at 4000 X g for 10 min and the pellets resuspended in infection medium (Murashige and Skoog salts with vitamins, 2% sucrose, 500μΜ MES (pH 5.6), 10μΜ MgSCU, and 100μΜ acetosyringone) to a concentration of OD^oo = 1.0 and subsequently held at 28°C for 3 hours. Infiltration of individual leaves was carried out on TEV-B tobacco plants (about 4 weeks old) using a 5mL syringe by pressing the tip of the syringe (without a needle) against the abaxial surface of the leaf. Infiltrated plants were maintained at 22-25°C with a photoperiod of 16 hours light and 8 hours dark. Plant tissue was harvested after about 5 days post infiltration for subsequent analysis, Example 5. Yeast Transformation and Expression The plasmids prepared as described in Example 3 were introduced into yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using the FAST™-Ycast Transformation kit (G-Biosciences, St Louis, MO, USA). Since the vector contains the kanMX4 cassette, G-418 disulfate salt (Sigma. Α1720) was used as the selection agent at a final concentration of 200 pg/ml. Preparation of Competent Ceils. Yeast cells were grown at 30°C in 10ml YPD broth until mid-log phase (about 5 χ 106 to about 2 χ 107 cells/ml or an OD600 of about 0.8 to about 1.0). Cells were pelleted at 500 χ g for 4 minutes and the supernatant discarded. 10 ml Wash Solution was used to wash the pellet. Following the wash, the cells were re-pelleted and the supernatant discarded. One ml Competent Solution was added to the pellet to resuspend the cells. Transformation. Competent cells (50 μ1) were mixed with 0.2-1 p.g DNA in a volume of less than 5μ1. Transformation Solution (500 μ1) was added to the cells and mixed thoroughly. The cell/DNA mixture was incubated at 30°C for 45 minutes and then mixed vigorously by flicking with a finger. The mixing step was performed 2-3 times during the 45 minute incubation. The transformation mixture (DNA/cells) was spread (50 μ1 -150 μ1) on an appropriate plate as known in the art. The plate with the transformation mixture was then incubated at 30°C for 2-4 days to allow for growth of transformants, Transgenic yeast cells were identified based on their ability to produce blue fluorescence when viewed under a fluorescence microscope. Example 6. Sample collection from tobacco leaves transiently expressing reporter protein AmCyan. Three tobacco plants were planted per construct for sampling for qRT-PCR and ELISA. Two leaves per plant were infiltrated with agrobacteria containing the nucleotide sequences of the variants that express the AmCyan protein. Six samples were collected from the infiltrated leaves three days after infiltration, two samples from each plant. Two “punches” (about 20mg) of leaf tissue were collected per sample. Protein extracts were prepared from the approximately 100 - 500 mg of leaf tissue collected from tobacco plants transiently expressing AmCyan, as described above. Specifically, leaf material was placed into 24 deep well blocks containing small steel balls and pre-cooled on dry ice. Samples were ground to a fine powder using a Genogrinder (SPEC/CertiPrep, Metuchen, New Jersey). Samples were then extracted in 500-1000 μ1 of Western Extraction Buffer (WEB = 12.5 mM sodium borate, ρΗ10; 2% ΒΜΕ and 1% SDS) at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes followed by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 13,000 rpm. Example 7. Sample collection from the yeast expression system. Three colonies were picked per each variant. Transgenic yeast cells were grown overnight in YPD broth containing G-418 at 30°C with shaking at 255 rpm. The following morning, cultures were diluted to an O.D. of about 0.5 at 600 nm. Three to four hours later when the O.D. of the cultures reached about 1.0 at 600 nm, the cells were harvested. Two ml for each variant was used and total protein and total RNA were isolated. Protein was isolated using Y-PER Yeast Protein Extraction Reagent (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Total RNA was isolated using RNA Easy Mini Kit (Q1AGEN). To generate spheroplasts, yeast cells were resuspended in 2 ml of Buffer Υ containing zymolase and incubated 30 min at 30°C with gentle shaking at 75 rpm. Buffer Υ was prepared by adding 50χ (10 mg/ml) zymolase-100Τ (from Arthrobacter luteus; Seikagaku Biobusiness Corporation, Japan) and 0.1% P-mercaptoehtanol to 1Μ sorbitol and 0.1 EDTA, pH 7.4 solution. To eliminate DNA contamination, RNA samples were digested with RNAse-Free DNase Set (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Three protein and three RNA samples were analyzed by ELISA and quantitative PCR for each variant. Example 8. Estimation of Transcript and Protein Levels A. Estimation of transcript level by qRT-PCR method. Plant tissue samples or yeast cells expressing the variants were collected and kept frozen at -80°C until processed. RNA was extracted from the samples by a Magnetic Bead (Promega) procedure followed by DNA digestion. TaqMan assays were selected based on the target of interest. Thus, these assays consist of a forward and reverse primer and a FAM-labeled probe that are specific to the target sequence. A species specific TET-labeled reference target was also run for each sample for relative expression calculation. One-step RT-PCR reactions were set up in triplicate (3 for endogenous reference gene (e.g., wild-type/ native) and 3 for the target gene) in 384 well PCR plates. A wild type control and no-RT negative control were included on each plate to test for non-specific amplification and DNA contamination, respectively. The results were captured on areal-time thermocycler (ABI 7900 ΗΤ). The threshold values were set by the analyzer for each reporter and the resulting data was exported to the sampling template. Relative expression was calculated for each sample. Β. Quantitative CFP ELISA. The CFP ELISA immunoassay is a quantitative sandwich assay for the detection of ArnCyan fluorescent protein (CFP). It employs two polyclonal antibodies which have been produced against the CFP gene product and immunoadffinity purified against the CFP protein. High-binding polystyrene plates (Costar®, Cambridge ΜΑ) are coated at 4°C overnight with 2 qg/ml rabbit anti-CFP (Protein A purified) in 25 mM borate, 75 mM NaCl, pH 8.5. Plates are washed five times with 10 mM Tris, pH 8.0 containing 0.05% Tween-20 and 0.2% NaN3. Samples were prepared by adding four % inch leaf punch samples into 96-well blocks containing steel beads. The samples are ground using a Kleco grinder followed by adding 500 μ1 0.1 Μ sodium tetraborate pH 7.5, 0.5% Tween-20, and 0.2% polyvinyl pyrrolidone (extraction buffer) and mixing well. The blocks are centrifuged at 3500 χ g for 2 min before diluting the supernatant in ELISA diluents (PBS containing 1% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20 and 0.2% NaNs). Standards (128,64, 32,16, 8, 4, 2, and 0 ng/ml of purified CFP protein) are prepared in Elisa diluents. One hundred microliters of each appropriately diluted sample or standard is added to tire plant, incubated for 1 hour at ambient temperature with shaking at 200 rpm, and washed five times. Goat anti-CFP IgG (100 pi/we if) at 5 pg/ml is then added to the plate, incubated for 1 hour at ambient temperature with shaking at 200 rpm, and washed as before. Donkey anti-goat conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) at 1 pg/ml is added to the plate (100 pl/well), incubated at ambient temperature with shaking at 200 rpm, and washed. Substrate p-nitropheyl phosphate (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) is added and allowed to develop for 30 min at ambient temperature. The absorbance is measured at 405 nm with 492 as a reference using a microplate reader (Tecan Rainbow, Research Triangle Park, NC). The standard curve uses a fouparameter curve fit to plot concentration versus the absorbance. It is noted that other methods of quantification of ArnCyan involving fluorescent assays (ArnCyan can be detected by excitation at 475 nm and emission at 515 nm) may be used to estimate the level of protein expression. C. Western Blot analysis was performed to check for possible post translational modification of the expressed protein and a data analysis is done to correlate the thermodynamic parameters of mRNA and the level of protein production. Samples were ground to a fine powder and were then extracted in 500-1000 μ1 of Western Extraction Medium (WEB=12.5 mM sodium borate, pH 10; 2% ΒΜΕ and 1% SDS) at room temperature for approximately 30 minutes followed by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 13,000 rpm. D. SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was performed by transferring 10μℓ of the extracted samples to an eppendorf tube and adding 25 μ1 4XBioRad LDS or modified BioRad loading buffer (4Χ BioRad LDS: ΒΜΕ at a ratio of 2:1). Samples were heated for 10 minutes at 70°C and then immediately placed on ice for 5 minutes. Following incubation on ice, samples were centrifuged briefly. Sample extracts (5 -10 μ1) were run on BioRad 4-12% Bis/Tris protein gel (18 well) using MOPS buffer. Ε. Immunoblot analysis was performed by transferring SDS-PAGE gels onto a nitrocellulose membrane using chilled Nupage transfer buffer (Invitrogen) for 30 minutes at 100 volts. The total protein transferred to the blot was visualized using Ponceau stain (Sigma). Following Ponceau staining, the membrane was incubated in blocking buffer for 30 minutes in TBST wash buffer (30 mM Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) with 3% dry milk, then washed three times for 5 minutes in TBST. The primary antibody was added at 1 pg/ml in TBST wash buffer with 3% milk, and the blot incubated 2 hours to overnight. Following incubation, the blot was washed three times for 5 minutes each in TBST wash buffer. The secondary antibody (Rabbit-AP) was diluted 1:8000 (in TBST) and added to blot for at least 30 minutes, Following incubation in the secondary antibody, the blot was again washed three times for 5 minutes each. Visualization of immuno reactive bands was carried out by adding Moss BCIP/NBT-alkaline phosphatase substrate. The blots were rinsed thoroughly in water following incubation in the BCIP/NBT substrate and allowed to air dry. F. Fluorescent Microscopy. The tobacco leaf samples were examined under the microscope (Nikon SMZ 1500) for accumulation of fluorescent AnCyan protein, Example 9. Results A. Tobacco Tn-Planta Transient Expression System. Expression level of transiently expressed AmCyan protein in plants. Two sets of independent experiments were carried out to analyze the expression level of transiently expressed AmCyan protein in tobacco infiltrated with different vector constructs of the variant nucleotide sequences. See Fig. 3. which shows the level of AmCyan transcripts in leaf samples infiltrated with indicator vector constructs (Fig. 3Α) and relative mRNA levels of AmCyan to ΡΡΟ (Fig. 3Β). The qRT-PCR results suggest that all constructs have similar mRNA levels within the variations typical of qRT-PCR for the data with the exception of construct 8707, which had a very low mRN A level. The expression levels of transiently expressed AmCyan protein in tobacco for various constructs were quantified by the ELISA method. Duplicate samples from three tobacco plants were collected for each construct. The expression levels (measured by ELISA) of CPF were normalized with respect to total extracted cellular protein. Averages of six data points are plotted in Fig. 4Α and Fig. 4Β. The expression levels of the internalized ΡΡΟ control from the same samples were also quantified by the ELISA method and normalized with respect to total extracted cellular protein. The ELISA data shows that the expression level for ΡΡΟ is almost the same for the different constructs while the expression level for AmCyan (CFP) varied over a wide range. The expression levels of AmCyan (square-CFP) and the normalized relative values to ΡΡΟ (circle-CFP*) were plotted against the free energy values (minimum free energy (Fig. 4Α) and ensemble free energy (Fig. 4Β) and of their 40 nucleotide (-4 to 36) mRNA transcripts. Similar plots for the second data set are shown in Fig. 5Α and Fig. 5Β. These results clearly show that AmCyan protein expression levels increase with the increase in the free energy value of the 5!mRNA transcript with an R2 value of 0,8 when the data were fitted with a linear equation. Similar results were observed for the expression level of AmCyan relative to ΡΡΟ with a R2 value of 0.75. An alternative plot of the data described above is shown in Fig. 6. A careful examination of the codon usage in the first 36 nucleotides of the gene indicate that the three contracts with the lowest expression levels have double rare codons of the same type. This suggests that the low expression of these constructs may be partially due to these double rare codons. The remaining data excluding these three constructs fit well with exponential decay (R2=0.81) as shown in Fig. 6. Fluorescent microscopic observations of tobacco leaf samples infiltrated with variant nucleotide sequence constructs. Visual observations under a fluorescent microscope of samples taken from leaves infiltrated with the different nucleic acid constructs described herein supported the co-relationship between the amount of AmCyan (CFP) variant protein expression and the folding free energy of the associated transcript. Β. Yeast Expression System. 5 SNA and Protein Analysis in Yeast Cells. The levels of AmCyan mRNA showed variations among different variants, however when they were normalized with respect to measure kanMX4 transcript, an internal control derived from the same vector^ the ratios were not significantly different among different variants. The levels of AmCyan protein measured by ELISA using anti-CFP antibody ranged [0 from 3021 ng/mg to 12,062 ng/mg total soluble protein (Table 4). Table 4.

The plot of the transcript folding energy versus the ratio of AmCyan protein expression (as measured by ELISA) over AmCyan mRNA (measured by qRT-PCR) is shown in Fig. 6 (data in Table 4). The correlation between estimated mRNA folding energy and AmCyan protein expression was R2=0.34. Thus, this data shows that as MFE values increase, protein production increases while mRNA transcript levels remain constant. A second plot (Fig. 7) in which the average ELISA data for each AmCyan variant was plotted against folding free energy, shows a linear correlation with R2=0.49. In comparison to the corresponding experiments in tobacco, the correlation between protein expression and folding free energy values was lower in the yeast (0.49 versus 0.8). Some possible reasons for the lower correlation in the yeast expression system may include the overall difference in the expression system (in this case, the yeast system is selected for high levels of protein production), the use of rare codons and/or the occurrence of consecutive rare codons in a few of the AmCyan variants tested. However, it is noted that the R2 value observed for yeast is comparable or slightly better than that observed for the Escherichia coli prokaryotic expression system of 0.44 reported by Kudla et al. (Science 324 (5924): 255-258 (2009)). C. Maize In-Plant a Transient Expression System. Expression cassettes were cloned into a binary vector. The constructs were transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain LBA4404 containing helper plasmid (pSBI) using a freeze-thaw method (An et al., Binary vector. In: Gelvin SB, Schilproot RA (eds), Plant molecular biology manual, Kluwar Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, ρρ A3 1-19 (1988)). Preparation of Agrobacterium cultures was carried out as described by Azhakanandam et al., Plant Mol Biol. 63: 393-404 (2007). In brief, the genetically modified agrobacteria were grown overnight in 50 mL of ΥΡ medium containing 100 μΜ acetosyringone and 10 μΜ MES (pH 5.6), and subsequently were pelleted by centrifugation at 4000Xg for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended in the infection medium (Murashige and Slcoog salts with vitamins, 2% sucrose, 500 μΜ MES (pH 5.6), 10 μΜ MgS04, and 100 μΜ acetosyringone) to 0ϋ600=0.5 and subsequently held at 28 degrees C for 2-3hours. The in-planta transient expression system was established using maize seedlings. Seeds were germinated under greenhouse conditions in 2.5 inch pots filled with Fafard germination mix. Seedlings were kept under a 14/10 day/night cycle with a day light intensity of 2000 p-mol-m-2.s-l maintained with supplemental lighting. The temperature was maintained between 23°C-26°C. The agroinfiltration experiment performed mostly using primary and secondary leaves of V2 stage (Ritchie S.W., Hanway J.J. Benson G.O. (edts): I low a Corn Plant Develops: Iowa State Univ Special Report No. 48, July 2005). To make infiltration easier, the seedlings were watered 1-2 hours prior to agroinfiltration, which keeps the leaf turgid and stomata open. Infiltration of individual leaves was carried out on maize seedlings using a 5 mL syringe body (BD 5 ml syringe with Luer-Lok™ Tip, BD™, Franklin Lakes, NJ 07427, USA), by pressing the tip of the syringe against the abaxial surface of the leaf. The first and second visible leaves of V2 stage were infiltrated with: 1 ml of agrobacterium suspension/28 seconds/leaf. Infiltrated plants were transferred and maintained under growth chamber conditions set at 25 °C with a 16/8 day/night cycle with a light intensity of 1900 p-mol-m-2.s-l. Plant tissue was harvested after 4 days post infiltration for subsequent analysis. Example 10. Step-wise selection of mRNA sequences To show the efficacy of selecting a mRNA sequence by group (step-wise rather than linear selection), variant mRNA sequences of ssRubisco chloroplast transit peptide with AmCyan (RbAmCyan) are selected as described herein. The MFE RNA secondary structure (MFE) value versus level of protein production for each mRNA sequence is determined. The sequences presented in Table 5, below, are variants of AmCyan with the chloroplast signal peptide, as described herein, with codon usage being optimized for tobacco expression. With the exception of the first three sequences provided in Table 5, each sequence was optimized for a GC content of about 50%. In addition, rare codon usage was avoided (i.e., codon usage of less than 15%). Approximately 209,952 different sequences were generated by reverse or back translation and 36 were chosen for testing (approximately three variants were selected for every 1 kcal/mol range) (Table 5).

Rare codon usage 5 In some instances, avoiding use of rare codon can be a step in optimizing transcript sequence based on its folding free energy. Table 7 provides variants of AmCyan with chloroplast targeting signal peptide each having one or more rare codons near the start codon. Six pairs of variants are tested: one set with rare codons and one set without rare codons. A rare codon is one which has a tRNA with an abundance of less than 15% l0 The impact of consecutive rare codons near the start codon can be studied using the sequences set forth in Table 7 (see, e.g., AAV and VSA in Table 7 below). Such consecutive rare codons may more severely impact the protein production by a mRNA than one with a single rare codon near the start site.
