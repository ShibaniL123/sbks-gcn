Example 8
To a suspension of ethyl 3-(5-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-hydroxyphenyl)propanoate (0.100 g, 0.342 mmol) and 2,4-dimethylthiazole-5-carboxylic acid (0.059 g, 0.376 mmol), and pyridine (0.12 mL, 1.541 mmol) in acetonitrile (4 mL) in a sealed tube was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 0.71 mL, 1.201 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 48.5° C. for 5 days. After cooling, the mixture was quenched with water (50 mL) and extracted with 8:2 dichloromethane/isopropanol (2×50 mL) followed by washing once with sat. NaHCO3 (100 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified by precipitating in 1:3 dichloromethane/diethyl ether mixture and filtration to give ethyl 3-(5-(2-(2,4-dimethylthiazole-5-carboxamido)thiazol-4-yl)-2-((hydroxy(propyl)phosphoryl)oxy)phenyl)propanoate (0.028 g, 15%) as an orange solid after dried under high vacuum.
