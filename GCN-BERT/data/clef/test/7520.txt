Field of the Invention The invention relates generally to the use of polycycloolefins in electronic devices and more specifically to the use of norbornene-type polymers to form gate insulator layers in the fabrication of electronic devices, including organic electronic devices (OEs), devices that encompass such norbornene-type polymer gate insulator layers and processes for preparing such devices that incorporate norbornene-type polymer gate insulator layers. Background and Prior Art Electronic devices, for example field effect transistors (FETs) are used in display devices and logic capable circuits. A conventional FET typically includes source, drain and gate electrodes, a semiconducting layer made of a semiconductor (SC) material, and an insulator layer (also referred to as "dielectric" or "gate dielectric"), made of a dielectric material and positioned between the SC layer and the gate electrode. Also known are organic electronic devices, for example organic field effect transistors (OFETs) that are useful in display devices and logic capable circuits. A conventional OFET also includes source, drain and gate electrodes but rather than an inorganic semiconductor layer, an OFET includes a semiconducting layer made of an organic semiconductor (OSC) material and generally an insulator layer made of an organic dielectric material positioned between the OSC layer and the gate electrode. WO 03/052841 A1 discloses embodiments of an organic field effect transistor (OFET) wherein the gate insulator layer is made of a dielectric material having a permittivity (ε) (also known as relative permittivity or dielectric constant (k)) of less than 3.0. Such materials, generally referred as "low k materials", are reported to provide good mobility regardless of whether or not the organic semiconductor layer is disordered or semi-ordered. WO 03/052841 A1 further reports that commercially available fluoropolymers such as Cytop™ (from Asahi Glass) or Teflon AF™ (from DuPont) are exemplary low k materials. In WO 05/055248 the use of fluoropolymers such as Cytop™ as gate insulator materials is disclosed as being advantageous for solution processed OFET devices where the OSC material is selected from soluble, substituted oligoacenes, such as pentacene, tetracene, anthracene, or heterocyclic derivatives thereof. These OSC materials are soluble in most common organic solvents. Therefore, when preparing a top gate OFET, the solvents for the gate dielectric formulation have to be carefully chosen to avoid dissolution of the OSC material by the solvent of the gate dielectric formulation when deposited in adjacent layers. Such a solvent is generally referred to as being orthogonal to the material of the OSC layer. Similarly, when preparing a bottom gate device, the solvent for carrying the OSC material onto a previously formed gate dielectric layer is selected to be orthogonal to the gate dielectric material. It has been reported that the above-mentioned fluoropolymers are problematic with regard to limited structural integrity and integration into processing in the mass production of OFET devices. Regarding processability, fluoropolymers often do not adhere well to other layers, for example the substrate and OSC layer, among others, generally exhibiting poor wetting of such layers. Also, many fluoropolymers, such as those of the aforementioned Cytop™ series, have low glass transition temperatures, Tg (~100-130°C) that make it difficult to use standard physical or chemical deposition methods for applying a metallized gate electrode layer over such a fluoropolymer dielectric layer. With regard to structural integrity, if a fluoropolymer having a low Tg is heated to, or above the Tg temperature during a metallization process, polymer cracking due to built-in stress can occur. Even where such cracking can be avoided, differential expansion between the fluoropolymer and any adjacent layer due to heating can result in polymer wrinkling. Where fluoropolymers with a higher Tg, like those of the Teflon AF™ series (e.g., Teflon AF 2400 with Tg = 240°C), have been used to overcome the aforementioned wrinkling or cracking problems, such materials often exhibit wetting and adhesion problems that are more severe than those exhibited by the low Tg materials. Thus there is a need for a polymer with good wettability and high Tg capable of forming a low k gate dielectric layer. One aim of the present invention is to provide gate dielectric layers for electronic devices which have one or more of a good wettability, a high surface energy, a high adhesion force, orthogonal solubility properties with respect to the semiconductor material, and no significant negative influence on device performance.

Summay of the Invention The present invention relates to the use of a polycycloolefinic polymer, or a polymer compositions comprising a polycycloolefinic polymer, for forming a gate insulator layer that is in contact with the organic semiconductor layer in an electronic device. The invention further relates to a gate insulator that is in contact with the organic semiconductor layer in an electronic device and comprises a polycycloolefinic polymer or a polymer composition comprising a polycycloolefinic polymer. The polycycloolefinic polymers are preferably norbornene-type addition polymers. The electronic device is preferably an organic electronic device, and is for example a Field Effect Transistor (FET), comprising an inorganic semiconductor material, or an Organic Field Effect Transistor (OFET) comprising an organic semiconductor material. Advantageously, such norbornene-type addition polymers are structurally tailorable to overcome the previously discussed drawbacks observed in known devices. Thus such norbornene-type addition polymers allow for time-, cost- and material-effective production of electronic devices, like for example OFETs employing organic semiconductor materials and organic dielectric materials, or FETs employing inorganic semiconductor materials and organic dielectric materials, on a large scale. Further, as will be discussed, such norbornene-type addition polymers exhibit orthogonal solubility with respect to the organic semiconducting materials. They are easily processable, exhibit structural integrity that generally exceeds that of the aforementioned fluoropolymers, enable an effective modification of the surface energy and provide improved adhesion to adjacent layers. Therefore they are especially suitable for use in gate insulator layers of organic electronic devices such as FETs and OFETs. The invention further relates to methods and/or processes that use such norbornene-type addition polymers or polymer compositions in the fabrication of electronic or organic electronic devices, such as FETs and OFETs, and to electronic and optoelectronic devices prepared by such methods and/or processes and/or comprising such polymers or polymer compositions. Detailed Description of the Invention As used herein, the terms FETs and OFETs will be understood to be inclusive of the subclass of such devices known as Thin Film Transistors (TFTs) and Organic Thin Film Transistors (OTFTs) where a FET or TFT described herein is inclusive of an organic dielectric material and an OFET or OTFT is inclusive of both an organic semiconductor material and the aforementioned organic dielectric material. It will be understood that the terms "dielectric" and "insulating" are used interchangeably herein. Thus reference to an insulating layer is inclusive of a dielectric layer. Further, as used herein, the term "organic electronic device" will be understood to be inclusive of the term "organic semiconductor device" and the several specific implementations of such devices such as the FETs and OFETs discussed herein. As used herein, the phrase "photoreactive and/or crosslinkable", when used to describe certain pendent groups, will be understood to mean a group that is reactive to actinic radiation and as a result of that reactivity enters into a crosslinking reaction, or a group that is not reactive to actinic radiation but can, in the presence of a crosslinking activator, enter into a crosslinking reaction. As used herein, the term "polymer" will be understood to mean a molecule that encompasses a backbone of one or more distinct types of repeating units (the smallest constitutional unit of the molecule) and is inclusive of the commonly known terms "copolymer", "homopolymer" and the like. Further, it will be understood that the term polymer is inclusive of, in addition to the polymer itself, residues from initiators, catalysts and other elements attendant to the synthesis of such a polymer, where such residues are understood as not being covalently incorporated thereto. Further, such residues and other elements, while normally removed during post polymerization purification processes, are typically mixed or co-mingled with the polymer such that they generally remain with the polymer when it is transferred between vessels or between solvents or dispersion media. As used herein, the term "polymer composition" means at least one polymer and one or more other materials added to the at least one polymer to provide, or to modify, specific properties of the polymer composition and or the at least one polymer therein. It will be understood that a polymer composition is a vehicle for carrying the polymer to a substrate to enable the forming of layers or structures thereon. Exemplary materials include, but are not limited to, solvents, antioxidants, photoinitiators, photosensitizers, crosslinking moieties or agents, reactive diluents, acid scavengers, leveling agents and adhesion promoters. Further, it will be understood that a polymer composition may, in addition to the aforementioned exemplary materials, also encompass a blend of two or more. As defined herein, the terms "polycycloolefin" and "norbornene-type" are used interchangeably and refer to addition polymerizable monomers, or the resulting repeating unit, encompassing at least one norbornene moiety such as shown by either Structure A1 or A2, below. The simplest norbornene-type or polycycloolefin monomer bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (A1) is commonly referred to as norbornene. The term "norbornene-type monomer" or " norbornene-type repeating unit", as used herein, is understood to not only mean norbornene itself but also to refer to any substituted norbornene, or substituted and unsubstituted higher cyclic derivatives thereof, for example Structures B1 and B2, shown below, where Z is selected from -CH2- or -CH2-CH2- and m is an integer from 0 to 3. By the substitution of the norbornene with a pendent group, the polymer properties can be tailored to fulfill the needs of individual applications. The procedures and methods that have been developed to polymerize functionalized norbornenes exhibit an outstanding flexibility and tolerance to various moieties and groups attached to the norbornene ring. In addition to polymerization of monomers with specific pendent groups, monomers possessing different functionalities can be randomly polymerized to form a final material where the types and ratios of monomers used dictate the overall bulk properties of the resulting polymer. As used herein, "hydrocarbyl" refers to a radical or group that contains a carbon backbone where each carbon is appropriately substituted with one or more hydrogen atoms. The term "halohydrocarbyl" refers to a hydrocarbyl group where one or more of the hydrogen atoms, but not all, have been replaced by a halogen (F, Cl, Br, I). The term perhalocarbyl refers to a hydrocarbyl group where each hydrogen has been replaced by a halogen. Non-limiting examples of hydrocarbyls, include, but are not limited to a C1-C25 alkyl, a C2-C24 alkenyl, a C2-C24 alkynyl, a C5-C25 cycloalkyl, a C6-C24 aryl or a C7-C24 aralkyl. Representative alkyl groups include but are not limited to methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl and dodecyl. Representative alkenyl groups include but are not limited to vinyl, propenyl, butenyl and hexenyl. Representative alkynyl groups include but are not limited to ethynyl, 1-propynyl, 2-propynyl, 1 butynyl, and 2-butynyl. Representative cycloalkyl groups include but are not limited to cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and cyclooctyl substituents. Representative aryl groups include but are not limited to phenyl, biphenyl, naphthyl, and anthracenyl. Representative aralkyl groups include but are not limited to benzyl, phenethyl and phenbutyl. The term "halohydrocarbyl" as used herein is inclusive of the hydrocarbyl moieties mentioned above but where there is a degree of halogenation that can range from at least one hydrogen atom being replaced by a halogen atom (e.g., a fluoromethyl group) to where all hydrogen atoms on the hydrocarbyl group have been replaced by a halogen atom (e.g., trifluoromethyl or perfluoromethyl), also referred to as perhalogenation. For example, halogenated alkyl groups that can be useful in embodiments of the present invention can be partially or fully halogenated, alkyl groups of the formula CzX2z+1 wherein X is independently a halogen or a hydrogen and z is selected from an integer of 1 to 25. In some embodiments each X is independently selected from hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine, bromine and iodine. In other embodiments each X is independently either hydrogen or fluorine. Thus, representative halohydrocarbyls and perhalocarbyls are exemplified by the aforementioned exemplary hydrocarbyls where an appropriate number of hydrogen atoms are each replaced with a halogen atom. In addition, the definition of the terms "hydrocarbyl", "halohydrocarbyl", and "perhalohydrocarbyl", are inclusive of moieties where one or more of the carbons atoms is replaced by a heteroatom selected independently from O, N, P, or Si. Such heteroatom containing moieties can be referred to as, for example, either "heteroatom-hydrocarbyls" or "heterohydrocarbyls". Exemplary hydrocarbyls containing one or more heteroatoms encompass groups such as ethers, epoxies, glycidyl ethers, alcohols, carboxylic acids, esters, ketones, anhydrides, maleimides, amines, imines, amides, phenols, amido-phenols, silanes, siloxanes, phosphines, phosphine oxides, phosphinites, phosphonites, phosphites, phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphates and the like. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the polycycloolefinic polymer incorporates two or more distinct types of repeating units, wherein at least one such type of repeating unit encompasses pendent crosslinkable groups or moieties that have some degree of latency. By "latency" it is meant that such groups do not crosslink under ambient conditions or during the initial forming of the polymers, but rather crosslink when such reactions are specifically initiated, for example by actinic radiation or heat. Such latent crosslinkable groups are incorporated into the polymer backbone by, for example, providing one or more norbornene-type monomers encompassing such a pendent crosslinkable group, for example a maleimide or substituted maleimide containing pendent group, to the polymerization reaction mixture and subsequently causing the polymerization of such monomers. One consideration in the design of dielectric materials for use in Bottom Gate FETs and OFETs is for the deposited material to form a layer that can withstand subsequent solution-phase processing steps that may be employed for the deposition or formation of layers after the aforementioned layer. The inclusion of pendent crosslinkable groups or moieties into repeating units, as discussed above, has been found advantageous in some embodiments in accordance with the present invention, as the inclusion of a latent crosslinking functional group onto the polymer backbone can provide for changing soluble polymer chains into insoluble polymer chains with only a small degree of crosslinking. However, in some embodiments in accordance with the present invention, resistance to solvent swelling of the dielectric is also desirable and a higher degree of crosslinking may be needed that for just providing insolubility. Therefore, it has been found advantageous to add distinct crosslinking agents to some embodiments of the present invention. Therefore preferred embodiments of the present invention take advantage of any of several crosslinking methodologies. For example, in a preferred embodiment an acid catalyzed epoxide ring opening is employed for crosslinking while in another preferred embodiment a photoinduced dimerization (e.g., 2+2) crosslinking reaction is used. Another preferred embodiment employs thermally activated crosslinking, where either a thermally activated group is present in the polymer, or a multi-component mixture (resin) is used, e.g., a trifluorovinylether moiety. For the later, a polycycloolefinic polymer with a reactive site, e.g., an OH group, and a crosslinker, e.g., a latent hardener such as an isocyanate, can be employed. It will be understood that the preferred embodiments in accordance with the present invention are not limited to the above described crosslinking methodologies, as other methods of achieving the desired degree of crosslinking can also be used in which additional photoactive crosslinkers, e.g., bisazides, can be employed with appropriate polymer compositions. Additionally, preferred embodiments of the present invention include combinations of the above methodologies. For example a preferred process includes a basic photopatterning step (to provide insolubility and patterning of the dielectric material), and further includes an additional high temperature curing step via additional thermally activated crosslinking sites in the polymer (to increase the crosslinking density), or includes the use of a combination of various photoactive systems, e.g., maleimides, coumarins, cinnamates and bisazides, to increase photoefficiency. In a preferred embodiment the polymer composition is a blend of a first polymer having one or more types of repeating units of formula I, and a second polymer having one or more types of repeating units of formula II. In another preferred embodiment the polymer composition contains, as polynorbornene-type polymer, only a first polymer having one or more types of repeating units of Formula I, or only a second polymer having one or more types of repeating units of Formula II. In another preferred embodiment, the polymer composition contains a single norbornene-type polymer having one or more repeating units of formula I and one or more repeating units of formula II: wherein Z is selected from -CH2-, -CH2-CH2- or -O-, m is an integer from 0 to 5, inclusive and each of R1, R2, R3 and R4 and R5, R6, R7 and R8 are independently selected from H, a C1 to C25 hydrocarbyl, a C1 to C25 halohydrocarbyl or a C1 to C25 perhalocarbyl group where such groups are as defined above and exemplified above and below, and with the proviso that the first polymer encompasses at least one type of repeating unit that is distinct from the one or more repeating units of the second polymer. The repeating units of formulae I and II are formed by corresponding norbornene-type monomers of formula la and IIa, respectively, where Z, m, R1-4, and R5-8 are as defined above: In the repeating units and monomers of formula I, la, II and IIa, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, Z is -CH2- and m is 0, 1 or 2, in another preferred embdiment Z is -CH2- and m is 0 or 1, and in still another preferred embodiment, Z is -CH2- and m is 0. Further preferred is an embodiments where only one of R1-4 is different from H and only one of R5-8 is different from H. In order to produce the desired properties for specific applications, a combination of norbornene monomers with several different classes of pendent groups can be polymerized to obtain control over the flexibility, adhesion, interface and solubility of the resulting polymer(s). For example, varying the length of an alkyl group attached to the backbone can allow control of the polymer's modulus and glass transition temperature (Tg). Also, pendent groups selected from maleimide, cinnamate, coumarin, anhydride, alcohol, ester, and epoxy functional groups can be used to promote crosslinking and to modify solubility characteristics. Polar functional groups, epoxy and triethoxysilyl groups can be used to provide adhesion to metals, silicon, and oxides in adjacent device layers. Fluorinated groups, for example, can be used to effectively modify surface energy and influence the orthogonality of the solution with respect to other materials. Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, very preferably where only one of R1-4 is different from H and where only one of R5-8 is different from H, one or more of R1-4 or one or more of R5-8 denote a halogenated or perhalogenated aryl or aralkyl group including, but not limited to those of the formula -(CH2)x-C6FyH5-y, and -(CH2)x-C6FyH4-y-pCzFqH2z+1-q, where x, y, q, and z are independently selected integers from 0 to 5, 0 to 5, 0 to 9, and 1 to 4, respectively. Preferably such formulae include, but are not limited to, pentachlorophenyl, pentafluorophenyl, pentafluorobenzyl, 4-trifluoromethylbenzyl, pentafluorophenylethyl, pentafluorophenpropyl, and pentafluorophenbutyl. Further still, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, very preferably where only one of R1-4 is different from H and where only one of R5-8 is different from H, at least one group that is different from H is a polar group having a terminal hydroxy, carboxy or oligoethyleneoxy moiety, for example a terminal hydroxyalkyl, alkylcarbonyloxy (for example, acetyl), hydroxy-oligoethyleneoxy, alkyloxy-oligoethyleneoxy or alkylcarbonyloxy-oligoethyleneoxy moiety, where "oligoethyleneoxy" is understood to mean - (CH2CH2O)s- with s being 1, 2 or 3; for example 1-(bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-2-yl)-2,5,8,11-tetraoxadodecane (NBTODD) where s is 3 and 5-((2-(2-methoxyethoxy) ethoxy)methyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (NBTON) where s is 2. Yet further still, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, very preferably where only one of R1-4 is different from H and where only one of R5-8 is different from H, at least one group that is different from H is a group that is either a photoreactive or a crosslinkable group. Preferred groups of this type encompass a linking portion L and a functional portion F. Preferably, L is selected from C1-C12 alkyls, aralkyls, aryls or hetero atom analogs, while F does preferably encompass one or more of a maleimide, a 3-monoalkyl- or 3,4-dialkylmaleimide, epoxy, vinyl, acetylenic, cinnamate, indenyl or coumarin moiety, which is capable of a crosslinking or 2+2 crosslinking reaction. Suitable and preferred units of Formula I and II comprising a pendent photoreactive or crosslinkable group such as described above are formed by one or more norbornene-type monomers that include, but are not limited to, those selected from the group consisting of the following formulae: where n is an integer from 1 to 8, Q1 and Q2 are each independently of one another -H or -CH3, and R' is -H or -OCH3 Further preferred repeating units of Formula I and II such as described above are derived from one or more norbornene-type monomers selected from the group consisting of the following structural formulae 1 through 5 below: For structural formula 1 above, m is an integer from 0 to 3, -A-R is a pendent group having connecting, spacer or bridging group group -A-selected from (CZ2)n, (CH2)n-(CH=CH)p-(CH2)n, (CH2)n-O, (CH2)n-O-(CH2)n, (CH2)n-C6Q4-(CH2)n, and C(O)-O, and where the end group -R is selected from H, CZ3, (CZ2)nCZ3, OH, O-(O)CCH3, (CH2CH2O)nCH3, (CH2)n-C6Q5, cinnamate or p-methoxy-cinnamate, coumarin, phenyl-3-indene, epoxide, CCSi(C2H5)3 or CCSi(i-C2H5)3, where each n is independently an integer from 0 to 12, p is an integer from 1-6, Q is independently H, F, CH3, CF3 or OCH3, Z is independently H or F, and R' is independently H or CH3. For structural formulae 2-5, -A- is as defined for formula 1.

Another preferred example of such a preferred embodiment is a polymer having repeating units derived from monomers in accordance with BuNB, HexNB, OctNB, DecNB and MeOAcNB, and additionally having repeating units derived from monomers selected from EONB, MGENB, DMMIMeNB, DMMIMeNB, DMMIEtNB, DMMIBuNB and DMMIHxNB.

These other polymers are preferably selected from polymers including but not limited to poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polystyrene (PS), poly-4-vinylphenol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, or combinations thereof, like PMMA-PS and PS-polyacrylnitrile. Examples of suitable norbornene monomers, polymers and methods for their synthesis are provided herein and can also be found in US 5,468,819, US 6,538,087, US 2006/0020068 A1, US 2007/0066775 A1 and US 2008/0194740 A1, which are incorporated herein by reference. For example, exemplary polymerizations processes employing Group VIII transition metal catalysts are described in the aforementioned US 2006/0020068 A1. The polymer embodiments of the present invention are formed having a weight average molecular weight (Mw) that is appropriate to their use. Generally, a Mw from 5,000 to 500,000 is found appropriate for some embodiments, while for other embodiments other Mw ranges can be advantageous. For example, in a preferred embodiment, the polymer has a Mw of at least 30,000, while in another preferred embodiment the polymer has a Mw of at least 60,000. In another preferred embodiment, the upper limit of the polymer's Mw is up to 400,000, while in another preferred embodiment the upper limit of the polymer's Mw is up to 250,000. It will be understood that since an appropriate Mw is a function of the desired physical properties in the cured polymer, films, layers or structures derived there from, it is a design choice and thus any Mw within the ranges provided above is within the scope of the present invention. Preferred embodiments in accordance with the present invention encompass the use of a polymer composition for forming a gate insulator layer in organic electronic devices. Such a composition comprises, in addition to one or more polycycloolefinic polymer components, a casting solvent, optionally having orthogonal solubility properties with respect to the OSC layer material, and optionally one or more additives selected from crosslinking agents, reactive solvents, stabilizers, UV sensitizers, adhesion promoters and thermal sensitizers. The sensitizers and other additives are typically added to the composition prior to it being used to form the aforementioned gate insulator layer. Therefore, preferred embodiments in accordance with the present invention encompass electronic devices or optoelectronic devices having or being obtained through the use of such polymer compositions. Such electronic or optoelectronic devices including, among others, field effect transistors (FETs) and organic field effect transistors (OFETs), thin film transistors (TFT) and organic thin film transistors (OTFTs), which can be top gate or bottom gate transistors, and integrated circuits (IC) as well as such devices as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags. For example, transistors made through the use of such polymer compositions as gate insulator or dielectric layers are depicted schematically in Figures 1 and 2. When using polynorbornenes that include pendent maleimide groups as crosslinkable groups, a preferred embodiment of the present invention uses commercially available UV sensitizers such as 1-chloro-4-propoxythioxanthone (CPTX), or other commercial UV sensitizers that absorb at wavelengths different than that of the maleimide group, thereby increasing the amount of absorbed incident light and undergoing a triplet-triplet energy transfer to the maleimide excited state. The sensitizer can be either incorporated within the polymer chain or added to the polymer composition as mentioned above. It is also possible to use a first compound of formula la or IIa with better absorption characteristics at a given wavelength, that is incorporated into a polymer formed from a second compound of formula la or IIa having the same latent reactive groups as the first compound. This can be achieved by adding a lower amount, for example 20%, of the first compound to a larger amount, for example 80%, of the second compound, and allowing curing to take place at the given wavelength. For example the compound DHNMINB (43) absorbs well at 365nm whereas the compound DMMIMeNB (34) does not, thus by adding e.g. 20% of DHNMINB to the DMMIMeNB allows curing to take place at 365nm without the addition of a further UV sensitizer. The DMMIMeNB may undergo reaction with the DHNMINB, or alternatively, where the second component is not involved in the crosslinking, may be in-solubilized by the surrounding DHNMINB polymer network. The epoxide crosslinking is preferably achieved using pendant epoxide functionality in combination with an acid catalyst. This acid catalyst is typically an onium salt which undergoes dissociation on exposure to UV radiation or heat. In the case of a photo acid generator (PAG) the initiation generally requires a low UV dose of an appropriate wavelength followed by a thermal annealing at between 80 and 180°C. Generally, temperatures at the lower end of the aforementioned range are more preferred ashigher temperatures can require a nitrogen atmosphere to prevent oxidation of the polymer. Alternatively, crosslinking can be thermally initiated and cured by baking at 180°C for 30 min in a nitrogen atmosphere. Following the crosslinking process the polymer network can contain residual acid from the PAG. To prevent unwanted effects in the organic transistor device which contains the dielectric due to such residual acid, the crosslinked polymer can be subjected to a swelling solvent into which water and base are dissolved. In this manner, such residual acid can be captured, neutralized and/or solubilized, then removed from the polymer by further washes with fresh swelling solvent. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, apart from the addition of components directly related to the photo crosslinking, multi-component formulations can also be added to the norbornene-type addition polymer to improve certain other characteristics. These additional components are preferably selected from anti-oxidants, radical-scavengers, adhesion-promoting components, surface-modification components and morphology controlling components. Suitable and preferred adhesion promoting compounds include, among others, silanes or sulphur containing compounds. Further still, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention, in the process for preparing a gate insulator layer a separate formulation, such as a formulation comprising adhesion promoters or a scavenging reactive wash solution, is used in addition to the gate insulator polymer composition described herein. The present invention also relates to electronic devices having or being obtained through the use of such polymer compositions. Such electronic devices including, among others, organic field effect transistors (OFET), thin film transistors (TFT), integrated circuits (IC) and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags. Where such electronic device embodiments include transistors made through the use of such polymer compositions for forming gate insulator layers, such transistors can advantageously include both top gate and bottom gate transistors. Turning now to the accompanying figures, Figure 1 and Figure 2 depict top and bottom gate organic field effect transistors, respectively, in accordance with preferred embodiments of the present invention. The top gate OFET device of Figure 1 includes a substrate (1), source and drain electrodes (2), an OSC layer (3), a gate insulator layer (4), a gate electrode (5), and an optional second insulator or protection layer (6) to shield the gate electrode from further layers or devices that may be later provided. Another subject of the present invention is a process for preparing a device, for example as illustrated in Figure 1, where a) source and drain electrodes (2) are formed on substrate (1), b) a layer of organic semiconducting (OSC) material (3) is formed overlying portions of substrate (1) and source and drain electrodes (2), c) a gate insulator layer (4) is formed overlying OSC material (3), d) gate electrode (5) is formed overlying at least a part of gate insulator layer (4) and e) optionally forming another layer (6), for example an insulating and/or protection and/or stabilizing and/or adhesive layer, overlying gate electrode (5) and gate insulator layer (4). In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a device for example as shown in Figure 1, is prepared by a process as described above, but where OSC layer (3) is formed on substrate (1) before source and drain electrodes (2) are formed. The bottom gate OFET device of Figure 2 includes a substrate (1), source and drain electrodes (2), an OSC layer (3), a gate insulator layer (4), a gate electrode (5), and an optional second insulator or protection layer (6) to shield the source and drain electrodes from further layers or devices provided on top of the OFET. Another subject of the present invention is a process for preparing a device, as for example illustrated in Figure 2, where: a) gate electrode (5) is formed overlying substrate (1), b) gate insulator layer (4) is formed overlying gate electrode (5) and portions of substrate (1), c) organic semiconducting (OSC) material layer (3) is formed overlying gate insulator layer (4), d) source and drain electrodes (2) are formed on at least a part of organic semiconductor layer (3) and e) optionally another layer (6), for example an insulating and/or protection and/or stabilizing and/or adhesive layer, is formed overlying source and drain electrodes (2) and portions of OSC layer (3). In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a device for example as shown in Figure 2, is prepared by a process as described above, but where source and drain electrodes (2) are overlying gate insulator layer (4) before the organic semiconductor layer (3) is formed. In the processes of the present invention, as described above with respect to Figure 1 and Figure 2, the forming of some or all of the layers is preferably carried out using solution processing techniques. This can be done for example by applying a formulation or composition, generally a solution, that encompasses, for example, the OSC or gate dielectric material, respectively, and at least one solvent, onto or over a previously deposited layer, followed by evaporation of the solvent(s). For forming the gate dielectric or insulator layer, a polymer composition embodiment of the present invention, as described above, is employed. Very preferred deposition techniques include, without limitation, dip coating, spin coating, ink jet printing, letter-press printing, screen printing, doctor blade coating, roller printing, reverse-roller printing, offset lithography printing, flexographic printing, web printing, spray coating, brush coating, or pad printing.Most preferaby spin coating, flexographic printing, or inkjet printing techniques are employed. It will of course be understood that specific parameters of any of the above solution deposition techniques will be tailored for the specific layer being formed and the final characteristics desired of such layer and device that the layer is part of. For example, where in some preferred OFETs a gate insulating layer having a thickness of 0.5 microns (µm) is desired, in other preferred OFETs such a layer may be formed having a desired thickness of 1.0 µm. Thus the specific parameters needed to form the 1.0 µm layer will of course be different than those needed to form the 0.5 µm layer. That being said, when a spin coating deposition technique is employed, an appropriate amount of a polymer composition embodiment of the present invention is applied to a substrate and spun, for example, between 500 and 2000 rpm for a period of, for example, 20 to 50 seconds to form a layer having a desired thickness, for example between 0.2 and 1.5 µm. After such layer is cast over the substrate, the substrate and layer are generally heated to remove residual volatile solvents. Such heating can be accomplished in an oven or by placing the substrate on a heated surface set to a temperature from 70 to 130°C, for a period of time from 1 to 30 minutes. It should be noted that where a spin coating technique is employed it is generally desirable to employ a solvent that is mostly evaporated after the spinning is completed, whereas when an inkjet or flexographic printing technique is used organic ketone solvents with a high boiling point are generally employed to extend equipment related processing times. Compositions include one or more polycycloolefinic polymers or polymer blends as described above and below, and one or more solvents, which are preferably selected from organic solvents including, but not limited to, hydrocarbon solvents, aromatic solvents, cycloaliphatic cyclic ethers, cyclic ethers, esters, lactones, ketones, amides, cyclic carbonates, fluorinated or perflourinated solvents or multi-component mixtures of the above. Exemplary solvents include cyclohexanone, mesitylene, xylene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), methyl n-amyl ketone (MAK), cyclohexanone, 4-methylanisole, butyl-phenyl ether, cyclohexylbenzene, propylene cglycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA), HFE7500, perfluoromethyldecalin and perfluoroperhydrophenanthrene. Preferably in the composition the concentration of the polycycloolefinic polymers or polymer blends is from 0.1 to 30 wt%, very preferably from 1 to 20 wt% and most preferably from 2 to 12 wt%. As mentioned above, a polymer composition of the present invention comprises a crosslinkable or crosslinked polycycloolefinic polymer to form the gate insulator layer, or component thereof, in order to improve one or more properties of the resulting film. Such film properties include, among others, structural integrity, durability, mechanical resistivity, and solvent resistance. Suitable and preferred crosslinkable polymers are for example those having one or more repeating units derived from monomers of formula la wherein one or more of R1-4 denote a crosslinkable group as described above, for example one of the DMMI-type monomers or one of EONB or MGENB. For crosslinking, the gate insulator forming polymer is typically exposed to electron beam or electromagnetic (actinic) radiation such as X-ray, UV or visible radiation or IR radiation like for example focused IR (e.g., using a laser) for local thermal crosslinking. For example, actinic radiation may be employed to image the polymer using a wavelength of from 11 nm to 700 nm, such as from 200 to 700 nm. A dose of actinic radiation for exposure is generally from 25 to 5,000 mJ/cm2, although higher energies can be employed where appropriate. Suitable radiation sources of actinic radiation include mercury, mercury/xenon, mercury/halogen and xenon lamps, argon or xenon laser sources, x-ray, or e-beam sources. Such exposure to actinic radiation is to cause crosslinking in exposed regions. In a preferred embodiment the gate insulator layer is post exposure baked at a temperature from 70°C to 300°C, for example for a period of 1 to 10 minutes. Post exposure bake can be used to further promote crosslinking of other crosslinkable moieties within exposed portions of the polymer, where the increased temperature of such bake serves to further the degree of crosslinking within such exposed areas. In a preferred embodiment a crosslinkable polymer composition is used for forming the gate insulator layer, which comprises one or more crosslinkable polycycloolefinic polymers comprising repeating units of formula I or II, wherein at least one of such repeating units comprises a crosslinkable pendent group. Very preferred are polymer compositions comprising a sensitizer, like CPTX, and a sovent, like MAK, cyclohexanone or cyclopentanone. In another preferred embodiment, the crosslinkable polymer composition comprises a stabilizer material or moiety to prevent spontaneous crosslinking and improve shelf life of the polymer composition. Suitable stabilizers are antioxidants such as catechol or phenol derivatives that optionally contain one or more bulky alkyl groups, for example t-butyl groups, in ortho-position to the phenolic OH group. The physical integrity of the electronic device is a key element for the manufacturing of more complex structures, like for example active-matrix backplanes of flat panel electrooptical displays. Adhesion between the substrate and the stack of the built-above layers should be strong enough to withstand further processing, like for example air-curtain drying or wet-processing with the use of organic solvents. If the adhesion is not strong enough it is possible that the built-above layer will peel-off, for example in case of air-curtain drying, or will be moved over the substrate, for example when in case of wet processing the solvent gets between substrate and layer by capillary forces. This is even more important when plastic substrates are used, because the surface energy of untreated plastic is usually low so that adhesion forces are not high. Possible solutions suggested in prior art to overcome these problems include methods which chemically modify the surface of the substrate, like for example oxygen plasma treatment, or use substrates pre-coated with additional layers like for example metal oxide layers for plastic substrates. However, methods of chemical modification of e.g. dielectric polymers are limited as these may negatively influence their properties, like for example their solubility, or may negatively influence device performance. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment the present invention a reactive adhesion promoter is used in addition to the crosslinkable polymer composition comprising a crosslinkable polycycloolefinic for forming the gate insulator layer. The reactive adhesion promoter comprises a first, crosslinking functional group that is capable of crosslinking with the pendent crosslinkable group in the crosslinkable polycycloolefinic polymer, and a second functional group which is a surface-active group that is capable of interactions, for example chemical bonding, with an adjacent device layer. Such adjacent device layers are for example a substrate or an underlying functional device layer onto which the gate insulator layer is deposited, or a functional layer that is deposited onto the gate insulator layer. In a first type of this preferred embodiment, the adhesion promoter is deposited on the substrate or layer on which the gate insulator is later formed, before deposition of the crosslinkable polycycloolefinic polymer composition that will form the insulator layer. The adhesion promoter is deposited on the substrate, for example by soaking the substrate with a solution of the adhesion promoter in a suitable solvent and then removing the solvent. The adhesion promoter forms a thin layer on the surface of the substrate, optionally under formation of chemical bondings with the substrate. Afterwards the crosslinkable polymer composition is deposited on the surface of the substrate covered with the layer of the adhesion promoter. After removal of any solvents, the crosslinkable groups of the adhesion promoter and of the crosslinkable polycycloolefinic polymer are crosslinked for example by UV exposure. The gate insulator layer according to this first type of the preferred embodiment can thus be prepared by a process comprising the steps of a) depositing on a substrate, or onto a device layer, which is for example a semiconductor layer or an electrode, an adhesion promoter as described above and below, which is optionally dissolved or dispersed in one or more organic solvents, b) if solvents are present, removing said solvents, thereby forming a layer of the adhesion promoter on the surface of the substrate, c) depositing a layer of a crosslinkable polycycloolefinic polymer composition, which comprises a crosslinkable polycycloolefinic polymer as described above and below and optionally comprises a solvent, on the surface of the substrate containing the adhesion promoter layer, d) if solvents are present, removing said solvents, and e) exposing the layer of the polycycloolefinic polymer to heat or actinic radiation that causes crosslinking of the crosslinkable groups of the adhesion promoter and the crosslinkable groups of the polycycloolefinic polymer, thereby forming the gate insulator layer. In a second type of this preferred embodiment the gate insulator layer is formed from a crosslinkable polymer composition which comprises a crosslinkable polycycloolefinic polymer and an adhesion promoter additive comprising a surface-active functional group and a crosslinkable functional group capable of crosslinking with the crosslinkable groups of the crosslinkable polycycloolefinic polymer. The gate insulator layer according to this second type of the preferred embodiment can be prepared by a process comprising the steps of a) depositing onto a substrate, or onto a device layer, which is for example a semiconductor layer or an electrode, a layer of a crosslinkable polymer composition comprising an adhesion promoter, a crosslinkable polycycloolefinic polymer and a solvent, b) removing the solvent, and c) exposing the layer of the polymer composition to heat or actinic radiation that causes crosslinking of the crosslinkable groups of the adhesion promoter and the crosslinkable groups of the polycycloolefinic polymer, thereby forming a gate insulator layer. The use of such reactive adhesion promoters in a crosslinkable polymer composition of the present invention advantageously can improve the adhesion of a layer formed therefrom to an underlying layer. Thereby, the adhesion of the gate insulator layer can be improved without changing the polymer used to form the layer and potentially negatively affecting the performance of the layer. The surface active group of the reactive adhesion promoter is preferably a silane or silazane group. Preferably the surface-active group is a silane group of the formula -SiR12R13R14, or a silazane group of the formula -NH-SiR12R13R14, wherein R12, R13 and R14 are each independently selected from halogen, silazane, C1-C12-alkoxy, C1-C12-alkylamino, optionally substituted C5-C20-aryloxy and optionally substituted C2-C20-heteroaryloxy, and wherein one or two of R12, R13 and R14 may also denote C1-C12-alkyl, optionally substituted C5-C20-aryl or optionally substituted C2-C20-heteroaryl.

P is preferably selected from a maleimide, a 3-monoalkyl-maleimide, a 3,4-dialkylmaleimide, an epoxy, a vinyl, an acetyl, an indenyl, a cinnamate or a coumarin group, or comprises a substituted or unsubstituted maleimide portion, an epoxide portion, a vinyl portion, a cinnamate portion or a coumarin portion. Preferably A' is selected from (CZ2)n, (CH2)n-(CH=CH)p-(CH2)n, (CH2)n-O, (CH2)n-O-(CH2)n, (CH2)n-C6Q4-(CH2)n, (CH2)n-C6Q10-(CH2)n and C(O)-O, where each n is independently an integer from 0 to 12, p is an integer from 1-6, Z is independently H or F, C6Q4 is phenyl that is substituted with Q, C6Q10 is cyclohexyl that is substituted with Q, Q is independently H, F, CH3, CF3 or OCH3. Suitable and preferred compound are selected from formula A1: where SiR12R13R14 is a silane group as defined above, A' is as defined above and below, and R10 and R11 are each independently H or a C1-C6 alkyl group. Especially preferred are DMMI-propyl-(Si(OEt)3, DMMI-butyl-(Si(OEt)3, DMMI-butyl-(Si(OMe)3, DMMI-hexyl-(Si(OMe)3, As used herein, the terms "spacer group", "connecting group" and "bridging group" are known to the skilled person (see e.g. Pure Appl. Chem. 73(5), 888 (2001). The spacer group A' preferably denotes linear C1 to C30 alkylene or branched C3 to C30 alkylene or cyclic C5 to C30 alkylene, each of which is unsubstituted or mono- or polysubstituted by F, Cl, Br, I or CN, wherein optionally one or more non-adjacent CH2 groups are replaced, in each case independently from one another, by -O-, -S-, -NH-, -NR18-, -SiR18R19-, -C(O)-, -C(O)O-, -OC(O)-, -OC(O)-O-, -S-C(O)-, -C(O)-S-, -CH=CH- or - C≡C- in such a manner that O and/or S atoms are not linked directly to one another, R18 and R19 are independently of each other H , methyl, ethyl or a C3 to C12 linear or branched alkyl group. Preferred groups A' are -(CH2)p-, -(CH2CH2O)q -CH2CH2-, -CH2CH2-S-CH2CH2- or -CH2CH2-NH-CH2CH2- or -(SiR18R19-O)p-, with p being an integer from 2 to 12, q being an integer from 1 to 3 and R18 and R19 having the meanings given above. Further preferred groups A' are selected from methylene, ethylene, propylene, butylene, pentylene, hexylene, heptylene, octylene, nonylene, decylene, undecylene, dodecylene, octadecylene, ethyleneoxyethylene, methyleneoxybutylene, ethylene-thioethylene, ethylene-N-methyl-iminoethylene, 1-methylalkylene, ethenylene, propenylene and butenylene. The synthesis of adhesion promoters like those of formula A1 is disclosed in examples AD1 as well as in US 4,565,873. In another preferred embodiment the gate insulator layer comprises a polymer or polymer composition that contains one or more repeating units, preferably of formula I or II, having a crosslinkable group, and the gate insulator layer further comprises a crosslinker which is a compound comprising two or more crosslinkable functional groups that are capable of reacting with the crosslinkable group of the said repeating unit of the polymer or polymer composition. In order to improve the processing of the functional layers and the integrity of the electronic device, it is desirable to decrease the time needed for the process while keeping or improving the physical properties of the layers being formed. This can be maintained where subsequent layers and solvents used in forming such layers are orthogonal and thus do not dissolve each other. Where such orthogonality is difficult to obtain, crosslinking, typically UV crosslinking, a first functional layer to make such first layer insoluble with respect to the polymer composition of a second functional layer will prevent any influence of the properties of either layer on the other layer. Shortening the time needed for the processing can be done for example by tuning the coating process, while decreasing the time needed for UV crosslinking can be achieved both by chemical adjustment of the dielectric polymer or by changes in the process. However, chemical modifications of dielectric polymers are limited, because the UV sensitivity is related to certain properties of the polymer dielectric, and for example changes towards increased UV sensitivity may decrease the solubility. Changing the process, for example by. using higher power UV, could increase the possibility of creating an ozone atmosphere and thus cause undesired changes in the surface of the polymer dielectric. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention the polymer composition comprises one or more crosslinker additives. Such additives comprise two or more functional groups that are capable of reacting with the pendent crosslinkable groups of the polycycloolefinic polymer polymer used to form the gate insulator layer. It will also be understood that the use of such crosslinker additives can also enhance the crosslinking of the aforementioned polymer. Crosslinking by exposure to UV radiation is preferred. The use of a crosslinker enhances the ability to pattern the gate insulator layer through the use of an imagewise exposure to an appropriate wavelength and dose of UV radiation. The crosslinkable group of the crosslinker is preferably selected from a maleimide, a 3-monoalkyl-maleimide, a 3,4-dialkylmaleimide, an epoxy, a vinyl, an acetyl, an indenyl, a cinnamate or a coumarin group, or a group that comprises a substituted or unsubstituted maleimide portion, an epoxide portion, a vinyl portion, a cinnamate portion or a coumarin portion.

Further preferred groups A" are selected from methylene, ethylene, propylene, butylene, pentylene, hexylene, heptylene, octylene, nonylene, decylene, undecylene, dodecylene, octadecylene, ethyleneoxyethylene, methyleneoxybutylene, ethylene-thioethylene, ethylene-N-methyl-iminoethylene, 1-methylalkylene, ethenylene, propenylene and butenylene. The synthesis of crosslinkers like those of formula C1 is disclosed for example in Examples AD2 and AD3 as well as in US 3,622,321. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, in the aforementioned processes for preparing a gate insulator layer or an electronic device the gate insulator layer is formed from a polymer composition comprising a crosslinkable polycycloolefinic polymer and a crosslinker as described above and below, and the process of forming the gate insulator layer comprises the step of crosslinking the crosslinkable groups of the crosslinker and of the crosslinkable polymer, preferably by UV exposure. The other components or functional layers of the electronic device, like the substrate, the electrodes, and the OSC layer, can be selected from standard materials, and can be manufactured and applied to the device by standard methods. Suitable materials and manufacturing methods for these components and layers are known to a person skilled in the art and are described in the literature. While various substrates are used for the fabrication of organic electronic devices, for example a glass or plastic substrate, such plastic substrates are generally more prevalent. Preferred plastic substrates include, but are not limited to, alkyd resins, allyl esters, benzocyclobutenes, butadiene-styrene copolymers, cellulose, cellulose acetate, epoxy resins, ethylene-chlorotrifluoroethylene copolymers, ethylene-tetra-fluoroethylene copolymers, fiber glass enhanced plastic, fluorocarbon polymers, hexafluoropropylenevinylidene-fluoride copolymer, high density polyethylene, parylene, polyamide, polyimide, polyetherimides, polyaramid, polydimethylsiloxane, polyethersulphone, polyethylene, polyethylenenaphthalate, polyethyleneterephthalate, polyketone, polymethylmethacrylate, polypropylene, polystyrene, polysulphone, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyurethanes, polyvinylchloride, silicone rubbers, and silicones. While generally polyethyleneterephthalate, polyimide, and polyethylenenaphthalate are commonly used substrate materials a useful substrate can also encompass a metal or glass component coated with any of the above plastic materials. Further, it should be no surprise that employing a substrate with a uniform, homogeneous surface will generally result in good pattern definition. For top gate embodiments, the substrate may also be uniformly pre-aligned by extruding, stretching or rubbing to influence the orientation of the organic semiconductor in order to enhance carrier mobility. The electrode can be deposited by liquid coating, such as spray-, dip-, web- or spin-coating, or by vacuum deposition or chemical vapor deposition methods. Suitable electrode materials and deposition methods are known to the person skilled in the art. Suitable electrode materials include, without limitation, inorganic or organic materials, or composites of the two. Examples for suitable conductor or electrode materials include polyaniline, polypyrrole, PEDOT or doped conjugated polymers, further dispersions or pastes of graphite or particles of metal such as Au, Ag, Cu, Al, Ni or their mixtures as well as sputter coated or evaporated metals such as Cu, Cr, Pt/Pd or metal oxides such as indium tin oxide (ITO). Organometallic precursors may also be used deposited from a liquid phase. The OSC materials and methods for applying the OSC layer can be selected from standard materials and methods known to the person skilled in the art, and are described in the literature. In case of OFET devices, where the OFET layer is an OSC, it may be an n- or p- type OSC, which can be deposited by vacuum or chemical vapor deposition, or deposited from a solution. Desirable OSCs have a FET mobility of greater than 1x10-5 cm2V-1s-1. The OSC is used for example as the active channel material in an OFET or a layer element of an organic rectifying diode. OSCs are generally deposited by liquid coating to allow ambient processing. Exemplary liquid coating methods include, but are not limited to spray-, dip-, web- or spin-coating. In some embodiments in accordance with the present invention deposition by an ink-jet means is employed. Additionally, in some embodiments the OSC may be vacuum or chemical vapor deposited. The semiconducting channel may also be a composite of two or more of the same types of semiconductors. Furthermore, a p-type channel material may, for example be mixed with n-type materials for the effect of doping the layer. Multilayer semiconductor layers may also be used. For example the semiconductor may be intrinsic near the insulator interface and a highly doped region can additionally be coated next to the intrinsic layer. The OSC material may be any conjugated molecule, for example an aromatic molecule containing at least three aromatic rings. In some preferred embodiments of the present invention the OSC contains aromatic rings selected from 5-, 6-, or 7-membered aromatic rings, and in other preferred embodiments the OSC contains aromatic rings selected from 5- or 6-membered aromatic rings. The OSC material may be a monomer, oligomer or polymer, including mixtures, dispersions and blends of one or more of monomers, oligomers, or polymers. Each of the aromatic rings of the OSC can optionally include one or more hetero atoms selected from Se, Te, P, Si, B, As, N, O or S, where generally such hetereo atoms are selected from N, O, or S.

The rings may be optionally fused or may be linked with a conjugated linking group such as -C(T1)=C(T2)-, -C≡C-, -N(R')2-, -N=N-, -N=C(R')-. T1 and T2 each independently represent H, Cl, F, -C≡N or lower alkyl groups particularly C1-4 alkyl groups; R' represents H, optionally substituted alkyl or optionally substituted aryl. Where R' is alkyl or aryl these may be optionally fluorinated.

Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, as used herein plural forms of the terms herein are to be construed as including the singular form and vice versa. It will be appreciated that variations to the foregoing embodiments of the invention can be made while still falling within the scope of the invention. Each feature disclosed in this specification, unless stated otherwise, may be replaced by an alternative feature serving the same, equivalent or similar purpose. Thus, unless stated otherwise, each feature disclosed should be viewed as being merely exemplary, that is to say such a feature is a generic representation inclusive of all species therein. It will be further appreciated that the features disclosed in this specification may be combined to produce embodiments in accordance with the present invention except where a combination includes features and/or steps that are mutually exclusive. Further, it will be appreciated that many of the features described above, are inventive in their own right and not just as part of an embodiment of the present invention. The invention will now be described in more detail by reference to the following examples, which are illustrative only and do not limit the scope of the invention. Unless stated otherwise percentages are percent by weight and temperatures are given in degrees Celsius. In the examples that follow, synthetic routes to some exemplary monomers and methods for the polymerization of such monomers are demonstrated. These examples are in no way limiting to the scope of embodiments in accordance with the present invention. Additionally, it will be noted that for each of the synthetic routes and polymerizations, generally employ anhydrous and oxygen free conditions unless otherwise noted. That is to say that where an example instructs that a reaction vessel is charged with a solvent, the solvent meets the above condition and/or is sparged with an inert gas such as nitrogen to remove any dissolved oxygen and water. A: Monomer Synthesis Example A1. Synthesis of DMMIMeNB Dimethyl maleic anhydride (679 g, 5.39 mol) and 6L toluene were charged to a 12L flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, Dean-Stark trap, condenser, and thermocouple. The mixture cooled to 16°C as the dimethylmaleic anhydride dissolved in the toluene. To the mechanically stirred mixture 663 g of 99% aminomethylnorbornene (5.39 mol) was added with a 600 ml toluene rinse. An exotherm to 34°C was immediately observed and the mixture was slowly heated (to avoid excessive foaming) until reflux was observed. At 109°C, approximately 1.5 h from the start of heat-up, the solution cleared. 98 ml of water (>100% of theoretical) was collected in the Dean Stark trap indicating that the reaction was complete, which was confirmed by GC analysis. The mixture was then allowed to cool to room temperature, filtered, and the filtrate rotary evaporated to yield 1656 g (>100% yield) of a light brown liquid, 98.9% pure (GC). To this was added 128 g remaining from a previous batch of crude material and and both batches were then vacuum distilled. A forerun of 132 g was collected and found to contain 96.8% purity product and unreacted dimethylmaleic anhydride. In addition, a first fraction of 281 g, 99.4% purity product was collected at 146-149°C (0.78-1.15 Torr) and a second fraction of 920 g, 99.8% purity product was collected at 149°C (1.15-1.55 Torr). The combined first and second fraction of >99% purity product was 1201 g for a 87% yield. Example A2. Synthesis of MIEtNB Maleic anhydride (389g, 3.96 mol), ground in a mortar, and 6300 ml xylenes were charged to a reaction vessel equipped with mechanical stirring, a condenser, a Dean Stark trap and a thermocouple. The temperature was observed to drop to 19°C, while yielding a hazy solution. Aminoethylnorbornene (90.1% purity, 600 g, 3.94 mol) was added dropwise over a 20 minute period to the stirred mixture, causing the temperature to rise to 49°C and giving a deep amber solution. The solution was heated to reflux and after 5 hours 40 minutes the water take-off into the Dean-Stark trap was seen to essentially stop; 49 ml (68% of theoretical) of water was collected. A proton NMR analysis of the reaction mixture showed a very weak amido-acid signal at 6.3-6.45 ppm and GC analysis showed 86.8% of the desired product. The reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature and filtered to remove 72 g of a white solid. One-half of the reaction mixture, 3500 ml, was loaded directly onto a column of silica gel (1280 g) and the reaction solution was eluted from the silica column. The initial 1000 ml of eluent showed no product (by TLC with 2.5% methanol/dichloromethane), but the second 1000 ml, mainly xylenes, showed one spot on TLC and was rotary evaporated to give 61 g of product (A2). The silica gel was flushed with dichloromethane, giving three successive 1000 ml fractions (A3, A4, and A5 respectively) containing 150 g impure product. The remaining reactant solution, 3500 ml in xylenes, was loaded onto 1273 g silica and flushed with recycled xylenes. The first three 1000 ml xylenes fractions (B1-B3) each showed one spot on TLC. The next 1000 ml fraction, B4, obtained with toluene as the eluent, gave one spot on TLC, but the next two 1000 ml toluene fractions (B5 and B6) showed weak levels of product in presence of other by-products. Fractions A2, B1, B2, B3, and B4 were combined and rotary evaporated to give 223 g of an oil which crystallized on standing. This was 97.4% pure by GC. This was recrystallized from 150 ml hot heptane to yield 124 g at 99.9% purity. A second crop yielded 22 g at 99.7% purity. Example A3. Synthesis of MIMeNB Maleic anhydride (117 g, 1.19 mol), charged to a reaction vessel equipped with mechanical stirring, a Dean Stark trap, a condenser and a thermocouple, was mixed with 860 ml o-xylene, causing the temperature to drop to 17°C, while yielding a hazy solution. Aminomethylnorbornene (98% purity, 1.17 mol) was dissolved in 144 ml o-xylene and added dropwise over a 15-minute period to the stirred mixture, causing the temperature to rise to 64°C and resulting in a white slurry. The mixture was mechanically stirred while heating to reflux for 5 hours. Water take-off in the Dean Stark trap stopped at 13.5 ml (64% of theoretical) after 4.5 h. TLC (2.5% methanol/ dichloromethane) and NMR confirmed the presence of product and the absence of non-cyclized amido acid. The reaction was allowed to cool to room temperature, filtered to remove precipitated white solids, and split into two 600 ml portions. Each portion was independently loaded onto 1000-1,100 g of silica and flushed with 6000 ml of dichloromethane. Rotary evaporation of the combined elutants gave 89 g crystalline product which was recrystallized from 40 ml hot heptane to give 81 g product at 99.4% purity. NMR analysis showed the product contained as much as 5.7 mol % o-xylene. The crystals were rotary evaporated under high vacuum at 45°C to remove the o-xylene, but subsequent NMR analysis revealed the presence of 1.8% maleic anhydride (believed to be masked by o-xylene in earlier analyses). The crystals were rotary evaporated again under high vacuum at 65-75°C to give product showing <0.6 wt% maleic anhydride by NMR. GC analysis showed 99.4% purity and no detectable maleic anhydride. Yield was 77 g (33% yield), mp 69.1-71.3°C (glasses at 66.1-68.6°C). Example A4. Synthesis of exo- DMMIEtNB Dimethylmaleic anhydride (18.75 g, 0.149 mol), was charged to a reaction vessel equipped with mechanical stirring, a Dean-Stark trap, a condenser and a thermocouple, was dissolved in 120 ml toluene, causing the solution to cool to 18°C. A toluene slurry of solid exo-aminoethylnorbornene (20.4 g, 0.149 mol) was added to dimethylmaleic anhydride solution and precipitation of white solids immediately occurred. The reaction mixture was mechanically stirred as the reaction was heated to reflux. At 102°C, reflux began and the solution cleared. After 17 minutes at reflux, the theoretical amount of water had been collected in the Dean-Stark trap. The reaction was heated an additional two hours at reflux and then cooled to 9°C. The mixture was then filtered to remove solids and the filtrate rotary evaporated to yield 43.7 g. This was distilled in the Kugelrohr oven to collect 17.9 g (46% yield) at 175-185°C (<1 mbar). GC analysis showed 99.0% purity. Example A5.

The reaction was stirred for 4 hours at 220°C, the pressure dropping to 130 psi. The reaction mixture was then allowed to cool to room temperature and drained, 2603 g of reaction mixture was collected. GC analysis indicated the product mixture to contain 65.6% NBEtOH isomers by GC (3-buten-1-ol is also present, but not calculated because it is in the solvent front). Excess 3-buten-1-ol, 1260 g, was removed by rotary evaporation at 50°C. The resultant concentrate was purified by distillation under high vacuum through a 14" column with glass helices packing.

The combined dichloromethane extracts were washed with (2 x 2 L) NaHCO3 solution followed by 1600 mL of 1 N HCl and then washed with brine in 2000mL portions until a wash pH = 6 was observed. The dichloromethane solution was then dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and rotary evaporated to give 613 g of a red liquid. NMR was consistent with structure. GC analysis gave mesylate content at 93.2%. No further purification was attempted since the material demonstrated instability during distillation. NBCH2CH7Br: A 22L reactor equipped with a thermowell, nitrogen adapter, addition funnel and mechanical stirrer was charged with lithium bromide (369 g, 4.25 mol) and 4L of 2-pentanone and stirred until the LiBr was dissolved, after which the solution warmed to 30 °C. Norborneneethylmethanesulfonate (613 g, 2.83 mol) dissolved in 2 L of 2-pentanone was then added to the LiBr solution with stirring and then diluted further with an additional 2L of 2-pentanone (total volume of 2-pentanone = 8 L). The solution was then heated to reflux, and was observed to become a white slurry. Upon reaching 92°C, GC analysis indicated <0.8% starting material remained and after 1 h at reflux, GC analysis showed no remaining starting material. The mixture was cooled to 27°C and 4L distilled water was added to clear the mixture. The phases were separated and the aqueous phase extracted with (2 x 2 L) ethyl acetate.

The GC analysis indicated that the crude product contained 62% product and 27% by-product (Et3SiCCSiEt3). The 178 g of crude product was distilled under high vacuum through a 14" column with glass helices packing to separate the triethylsilylacetylene and Et3SiCCSiEt3 by-product. The product was obtained in >99% purity (88.8 g, 43% yield) boiling point = 93-97°C at 0.20-0.21 mmHg. Example A12. Synthesis of EtPhDMMINB Bromophenyl-2,3-dimethylmaleimide (BrC 6 H 4 DMMI): A 1L RBF was equipped with a magnetic stir bar, condenser with nitrogen adapter. The RBF was charged with 4-bromoaniline (150.1 g, 872 mmol) and dimethyl maleic anhydride (DMMA) (100 g, 792 mmol) in 600 mL glacial acetic acid. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 6h and TLC was checked in 30% EtOAc in heptane. By TLC the reaction was complete, and the reaction mixture was allowed to cool overnight. The product solidified as an off-white crystal, which was filtered and washed with MeOH. Crystals were dissolved in EtOAc and washed with NaHCO3 solution. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4 and after concentration gave bromophenyl-2,3-dimethylmaleimide (BrC6H4DMMI, 170g, 76.5% yield) with a purity of 99.7% by GC. NBCH 2 CH 2 C 6 H 4 DMMI (EtPhDMMINB): A 3L, 4 necked RBF was equipped with a thermowell, condenser with nitrogen adapter, addition funnel and mechanical stirrer. The RBF was charged with Zn (82.0 g, 1.26 mol), iodine (10.6 g, 0.04 mol) and 800 mL degassed N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). The mixture was stirred at room temperature until the red color of iodine disappeared (ca. 2 minutes). Addition funnel was charged with NBCH2CH2Br (169 g, 0.84 mol) in 100 mL degassed NMP. The NBCH2CH2Br solution was added dropwise and the mixture was stirred at 80°C for 3 h. Completion of zinc insertion was indicated by GC analysis of hydrolyzed reaction mixture. The mixture was cooled to 60°C and BrC6H4DMMI (157 g, 0.56 mol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (51.8 g,0.045 mol) were added successively at 60°C. Then the reaction mixture was heated at 80°C for 2h 30min. The reaction was monitored by quenching an aliquot with 1 N HCl and extracting with EtOAc and followed by GC. After 2h 30 min there was only 38.8% product by GC, so, another 2 mol% Pd(PPh3)4 was added and stirred at 80°C for another 1 h, but no significant change in product was observed. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature and quenched with 2L 1 N HCl and extracted with (2 x 4L) 50% EtOAc in cyclohexane. The combined organic phases were washed with NaHCO3, brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated. The 200 g of crude product was adsorbed onto 200 g silica and chromatographed over 800 g of silica gel eluting with 0% to 20% EtOAc in cyclohexane. The concentrated purified fractions yielded 30.4 g of an off-white solid product (17% yield) with >94% purity by GC. Example A13. Synthesis of exo-ArSiNB Exo-norbornenylphenylbromide: To 1-bromo-4-iodobenzene (250 grams, 884 mmol) and PdCl2(PPh3)2 (6.20 grams, 8.84 mmol) in 400 mL of anhydrous DMF, was added norbornadiene (360 mL, 3.54 mmol), triethylamine (Et3N) (398 mL, 2.85mol), in a five-necked, three liter glass jacketed reactor purged with nitrogen. The reactor was heated via a hot water bath with a 50°C set point. At an internal reactor temperature of 50°C, formic acid (88%, 80 mL, 1.86mmol) was added drop wise through an addition funnel to prevent an exothermic reaction from occurring. The solution was heated and stirred at 50°C for 1.25 hours and sampled every 15 minutes with GC monitoring to ensure all the 1-bromo-4-iodobenzene was reacted. The reaction mixture was cooled, transferred to a separatory funnel, and extracted with 500 mL of 10% HCl and 470 mL of heptane. The combined aqueous layers were discarded. The combined organic layers were dried with 5 grams of MgSO4 and stirred for 30 minutes. The mixture was filtered through silica gel (200-425 Mesh) via a chromatography column, which was eluted with heptane. The crude material of exo-norbornenylphenylbromide (169 grams, 77% yield) was purified through a short path distillation setup at 90°C and 0.2 Torr. The distillation cuts contained 62 grams (>80%), 80 grams (>99%), and were colorless liquids. A sample of the pure (>99%) exo-norbornenylphenylbromide was analyzed via 1H NMR and was in agreement with the proposed structure and literature values. Exo-NBCH 2 CH 2 C 6 H 4 C=CSiEt 3 (exo-ArSiNB): To exo-norbornenylphenylbromide (103.8 grams, 0.417 mol) and triethylsilylacetylene (70.2 grams, 0.5 moles) in 750 mL of anhydrous DMF, was added dibutylamine (Bu2NH) (77.5 grams, 0.6 mol), PdCl2(PPh3)2 (10.53 grams, 0.015 mol), and copper(I) iodide (2.86 grams, 0.015 mol), in a three-neck, one liter glass jacketed reactor purged with nitrogen. The reactor was heated via a hot water bath with a set point of 65°C. The solution was kept heated and stirred at 65°C for 27 hours with GC monitoring every 3 hours to ensure that all the exo-norbornenylphenylbromide was reacted. The reaction mixture was cooled, and extracted with 200 mL of 10% HCl and 410 grams of heptane. The combined aqueous layers were discarded. The combined organic layers were filtered through a silica bed (200-425 Mesh) via a chromatography column and eluted with heptane. The crude material contained 122 grams of exo-norbornenylphenylethynyltriethylsilane. The main impurity in the sample was a reaction by-product, which was identified by GCMS as an acetylene dimer, Et3SiC≡C-C≡CSiEt3. Since the crude material could not be purified by distillation, it was retreated with silica gel via a chromatography column and eluted with heptane once more. The final material (43 grams, 35% yield) was a pale yellow oil (>98% purity). 1H NMR confirmed the identity of the final product as exo-norbornenylphenylethynyltriethylsilane. Example A14. Synthesis of EONB 1,2-Epoxy-9-decene (EPD) (≥96% (31.5 kg)) was charged to a jacketed reactor equipped with a dedicated hot oil unit, an apparatus to provide a split-range pressure control scheme and a feed weigh tank equipped with a metering pump. A premix of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) (≥98%) and EPD (9:1 molar ratio) (4.32 kg) was prepared and charged to a feed weigh tank. Oxygen was removed from the reactor headspace using (3) pressure/vacuum swings with nitrogen and then pressurized with nitrogen to 5 psig. The reactor content was heated to 210°C and when at temperature the premix was metered into the reactor at a constant rate over a 6 hour period. After completion of the metered addition, the reactor content was rapidly cooled to 25°C. Referring to Table A, below: A known weight of the crude reaction mixture of epoxyoctyl norbornene (EONB) was then charged to a vacuum distillation setup consisting a still pot with heating mantle, a packed distillation column (3 theoretical plates), a reflux splitter, a water cooled condenser, a condensate receiver and a vacuum pump. The distillation system vacuum was adjusted to the desired set point, and the oil bath used to heat the still pot to establish reflux conditions in the distillation column. Once these conditions were established, the reflux splitter was then started at the desired reflux ratio and fractional distillation proceeded by periodically removing liquid fractions from the overhead receiver. GC analysis was used to determine composition of the overhead liquid fractions. Distillation reflux ratio was adjusted as needed to affect composition of the overhead stream. The initial overhead fractions are enriched in the "light" components, which are primarily cyclopentadiene (CPD), dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) and epoxydecene (EPD). After removal of the "light" components, medium purity EONB (≥92%) is then separated from the remaining cyclopentadiene trimers (CPDT) and epoxyoctyltetracyclododecene (EOTD). The EOTD and other heavies are left in the still pot. The distillation process was terminated once the majority of EONB had been removed from the still pot residual. Referring to Table B, below: A second-pass distillation of the medium purity EONB obtained from the first distillation was used to obtain high purity EONB (≥98%) product.

A light tan solid formed. The mixture was heated. Between 65-95 °C the solid dissolved to give a clear, dark brown solution. The solution was heated to reflux and water was removed using a Dean-Stark trap (8.6 g) over the course of 6 hours. The reaction mixture was cooled and then concentrated using a rotary evaporator to achieve a very viscous brown oil (170 g). A portion of the oil (80 g) was purified by silica gel column chromatography using 5:1 mixture of hexanes and ethyl acetate as eluent. Twenty five, 125 mL fractions were collected.

A slight endotherm was observed (20 to 14°C) as the dimethylmaleic anhydride dissolved in the cyclohexane. The mixture was warmed to 25°C and a turbid solution was observed. The addition funnel was charged with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (189.2 g, 200 mL, 0.85 mol) which was added slowly over 15 minutes. An additional 300 mL cyclohexane was added to rinse in the 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and the addition funnel was replaced by a stopper. The mixture immediately exothermed to 24°C and a white turbid solution was observed. The mixture was heated carefully (to avoid excessive foaming) over 30 minutes to reflux. A clear solution was observed at 40°C and again turned to a white turbid solution at 70°C. The reaction mixture was refluxed for 1h at 70°C and aliquot was analyzed and indicated that the reaction was completed (88% product with 11% DMMA and no 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane). The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and the cyclohexane layer decanted to a 5L flask leaving the white polymeric residue (120 g). The cyclohexane layer was concentrated on the rotary evaporator at 60°C bath temperature. The residue was transferred to a 500 mL RBF and dried under high vacuum for 2h at 7 °C bath temperature to give 132 g of crude product as a viscous oil (crude purity 96.5% with 3.2% DMMA).

C: Device Preparation A top gate OFET is prepared as follows. A substrate of Corning 1737 glass is sonicated in 3% Decon90 for 30min at 70°C, washed twice with water and sonicated in MeOH, then dried by spin off on the spin coater. Gold source and drain electrodes of 30nm thickness are thermally evaporated through a shadow mask onto the substrate, creating a channel L = 50 µm and W = 1000 µm. The substrate is treated with the surface treatment formulation Lisicon™ M001 (available from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) for 1 min, washed with isopropyl alcohol and dried by spin off on the spin coater. The OSC Formulations Lisicon™ S1200 or SP320 (available from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) are spun onto the substrate after above treatment and then annealed for 1 min at 100°C on a hotplate. In the next step the dielectric layer is spun according to the conditions described in examples C13-20 below. A 30 nm gold layer is thermally evaporated through a shadow mask onto the dielectric layer to form the gate electrode. A bottom gate OFET is prepared as follows. A substrate of Corning Eagle XG glass is sonicated in 3% Decon90 for 30 min at 70°C, washed twice with water and sonicated in MeOH, then dried by spin off onthea spin coater. A 30nm aluminium layer is then thermally evaporated onto the substrate through a shadow mask to form the gate electrode. The dielectric is spun, annealed and cured according to the conditions described in Examples C1-12. In the case of latent reactivity provided by an EONB or MGENB moiety (examples C1-4) it is necessary to employ a reactive washing step after post annealing using Lisicon™ M008 (available from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) in which the dielectric is covered in M008 for 1 min, rinsed twice with THF and then spun to dryness.

The examples C1-C18 show that a gate insulator according to the present invention is suitable for use in an organic field effect transistor, where it shows good wetting and orthogonal solubility properties with respect to the organic semiconductor material, and enables good transistor performance. Example C19. OFET comprising a Gate Insulator with Adhesion Promoter A bottom gate OFET is prepared as follows. A substrate of Corning Eagle XG glass is sonicated in 3% Decon90 for 30 min at 70°C, washed twice with water and sonicated in MeOH, then dried by spin off on the spin coater. A 30 nm aluminium layer is then thermally evaporated onto the substrate through a shadow mask to form the gate electrode. The substrate is soaked with 1% solution of DMMI-propyl-triethoxysilane in PGMEA, spin-off and washed with IPA. A 17% solution of the homopolymer of DMMIBuNB (see example B64) containing 0.7% (w/w to polymer) of the sensitizer CPTX in MAK is coated by spin-coating, and UV cured for 4 minutes under 11mW/cm2 365nm irradiation. Silver source and drain electrodes of 30nm thickness are thermally evaporated through a shadow mask onto the substrate, creating a channel length L = 50 µm and channel width W = 1000 µm. Next the surface treatment formulation Lisicon™ M001 (available from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is applied for 1 min, washed with isopropyl alcohol and dried by spin off on the spin coater. Next the OSC Formulation Lisicon™ S1200 (available from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is spun onto the substrate after above treatment and then annealed for 1 min at 100°C on a hotplate. Figure 21 shows the characteristic of the transistor comprising the organic dielectric pDMMIBuNB with the adhesion promoter DMMI-propyl-triethoxysilane. Example C20. OFET comprising a Gate Insulator without Adhesion Promoter A bottom gate OFET is prepared as described in Example D3, but wherein the step of soaking the substrate with DMMI-propyl-triethoxysilane is omitted. Figure 22 shows the characteristic of the transistor comprising the organic dielectric pDMMIBuNB without adhesion promoter. The comparison between Figure 21 and 22 shows that transistor performance is not influenced by the use of the adhesion promoter. For mechanical characterisation a glass substrate is soaked with 1% solution of DMMI-propyl-triethoxysilane in PGMEA, spin-off and washed with IPA. A 17% solution of the homopolymer of DMMIBuNB (see example B64) containing 0.7% w/w of CPTX in MAK is coated by spin-coating, and UV cured for 4 minutes under 11mW/cm2 365nm irradiation. A reference sample is prepared by the process as described above, but without the step of soaking the substrate with 1% solution of DMMI-propyl-triethoxysilane in PGMEA. Mechanical tests are performed for both samples in 180°-geometry adhesion tests with the use of a Mecmesin machine (Multitest 1-i). Figure 23 shows a graph of the adhesion force vs. distance for both samples. It can be seen that the adhesion between the glass substrate and the DMMIBuNB polymer layer including the adhesion promoter DMMI-propyl-triethoxysilane is significantly improved, compared to the DMMIBuNB polymer layer without adhesion promoter. Example C21. OFET comprising a Gate Insulator with a Crosslinker A bottom gate OFET is prepared as follow. A substrate of Corning Eagle XG glass is sonicated in 3% Decon90 for 30 min at 70°C, washed twice with water and sonicated in MeOH, then dried by spin off on the spin coater. A 30 nm aluminium layer is then thermally evaporated onto the substrate through a shadow mask to form the gate electrode. A 17% solution of the homopolymer of DMMIBuNB (see example B64) containing either 0.7%CPTX (w/w to polymer), or 0.5% bis-DMMI-butyl (w/w to polymer) in MAK, or no additives, is coated by spin-coating, UV cured for different time under 11 mW/cm2 365nm irradiation. Silver source and drain electrodes of 30nm thickness are thermally evaporated through a shadow mask onto the substrate, creating a channel L = 50 µm and W = 1000 µm. Next the surface treatment formulation Lisicon™ M001 (available from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is applied for 1 min, washed with isopropyl alcohol and dried by spin off on the spin coater. Next the OSC Formulations Lisicon™ S1200 (available from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is spun onto the substrate after above treatment and then annealed for 1 min at 100°C on a hotplate.
