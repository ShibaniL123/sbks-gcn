BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention The invention relates generally to food analogs and particularly to food analogs having the appearance of real foods such as meats, vegetables, and fruits and to methods for making such food analogs. Description of Related Art Many known food analogs such as dry pet foods are formed in geometrical, regular shaped pieces that do not always have an appearance that represents natural foods such as meats, vegetables, and fruits, e.g., pet food kibbles. Although their textures have a somewhat meaty texture, even soft meaty chunk food analogs may not have the appearance of real meat chunks. Few, if any, dry pet food analogs currently exist that have meat analogs that have a credible meat appearance. There is, therefore, a need for new food analogs that resemble actual food products such as meats, vegetables, and fruits Pet foods having an appearance that is meat-like or attractive to consumers are disclosed in e.g., US 2010/233347; US 2008/260913; and US 2006/260537. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide food analogs that have the appearance of natural foods such as meats, vegetables, and fruits. It is another object of the invention to provide meat analogs that have the appearance of real meat, e.g., roasted or marinated meat. It is another object of the invention to provide non-meat analogs that have the appearance of vegetables or fruits, e.g., potatoes or apples. It is a further object of the invention to provide blended food compositions that contain food analogs of the invention and one or more other comestible ingredients or compositions. One or more of these or other objects are achieved using methods for making food analogs. The methods comprise comminuting one or more meats to produce a meat slurry, admixing one or more flours to produce a powder blend, admixing the meat slurry and the powder blend to produce a dough, and extruding the dough at a shear mechanical energy ranging from about 50 kJ/kg to about 500 kJ/kg and at a temperature ranging from about 60°C to about 120°C. The methods further comprise injecting a leavening agent into the dough while extruding the dough. The methods produce food analogs having various distinct and unique appearances and textures, e.g., meats and vegetables prepared using various food preparation methods. In some embodiments, one or more colorants are added before, during, or after the admixing or extrusion processes to provide a more natural appearance to the food analog. The food analog can be further processed to form the food analog pieces or other food analog forms. The food analog can be a meat analog or a non-meat food analog such as a fruit or vegetable. Other and further objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.

For example, animals can refer to pets such as dogs or cats or other animals such as humans, equines, bovines, and porcines. The term "meat" means meat and meat by-products including carcass, bones, skin, offal, and muscle. Fresh meat may be obtained directly from a slaughterhouse and is often selected from poultry including chicken, turkey, duck and goose; fish including tuna, salmon, trout, and cod; ovines including lamb and sheep; bovines including cow, calf and veal; and porcines including pig and wild pig. In some embodiments, the meat slurry can include ground or emulsified frozen meats. The term "single package" means that the components of a kit are physically associated in or with one or more containers and considered a unit for manufacture, distribution, sale, or use. Containers include, but are not limited to, bags, boxes, cartons, bottles, packages of any type or design or material, over-wrap, shrink-wrap, affixed components (e.g., stapled, adhered, or the like), or combinations thereof. A single package may be containers of individual components physically associated such that they are considered a unit for manufacture, distribution, sale, or use. The term "virtual package" means that the components of a kit are associated by directions on one or more physical or virtual kit components instructing the user how to obtain the other components, e.g., a bag or other container containing one component and directions instructing the user to go to a website, contact a recorded message or a fax-back service, view a visual message, or contact a caregiver or instructor to obtain instructions on how to use the kit or safety or technical information about one or more components of a kit. All percentages expressed herein are by total weight of the composition unless specifically stated otherwise. The skilled artisan will appreciate that the term "dry matter basis" means that an ingredient's concentration in a composition is measured after any free moisture in the composition is removed. The Invention In one aspect, the invention provides methods for making food analogs. The methods comprise comminuting one or more meats to produce a meat slurry, admixing one or more flours to produce a powder blend, admixing the meat slurry and the powder blend to produce a dough, and extruding the dough at a shear mechanical energy (ISME) ranging from about 50 kJ/kg to about 500 kJ/kg and at a temperature ranging from about 60°C to about 120°C. The methods further comprise injecting a leavening agent into the dough while extruding the dough. The methods, depending on the ingredients and the particular process conditions used, produce food analogs having various shapes, colors, properties, and appearances. The food analogs can be used as made or can be further processed to produce additional food analogs having various shapes, colors, properties, and appearances. The resulting food analogs can be used as foods for a meal or for any other suitable purpose, e.g., treats, snacks, food blends, and the like. The meats are any meats suitable for consumption by an animal and for producing for the desired food analogs, e.g., beef, poultry, and pork. Such meats are known to skilled artisans. The flours are any flours suitable for consumption by an animal and for producing the desired food analogs. Suitable flours include cereal flours such as wheat, wheat gluten, barley, rice, oat, and corn flour; legume flours such as soy and pea flour; and vegetable flours such as potato, arrowroot, and cassava flour. Other such flours are known to skilled artisans. In certain embodiments, the dough includes from about 0% to 70% by weight of the meat slurry and from about 70% to about 0% by weight of the powder blend. In various embodiments, the dough includes from about 30% to 70% by weight of the meat slurry and from about 70% to about 30% by weight of the powder blend. In certain embodiments, the dough includes from about 30% to 70% by weight of the meat slurry, including about 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, and 65% by weight. In certain embodiments, the dough includes from about 30% to 70% by weight of the powder blend, including about 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, and 65% by weight. In various embodiments, the shear mechanical energy used in the methods is from about 50 kJ/kg to about 500 kJ/kg, including about 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, 325, 350, 375, 400, 425, 450, and 475 kJ/kg and any ranges in between. In various embodiments, the extrusion temperature is from about 60°C to about 120°C, including about 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, and 115°C. The various ingredients and food analogs are comminuted, admixed, mixed, extruded, cut, sprayed, coated, and otherwise processed using methods and equipment known to skilled artisans. While admixing contemplates combining several ingredients, admixing is defined to include preparing a single ingredient for use in the process, e.g., using one type or meat or one type of flour. Various sprayers, dryers, and the like used in the methods are common and well known to skilled artisans. In some embodiments, as known to skilled artisans, the moisture content of the dough is adjusted to make dough with a consistency suitable for extrusion, particularly on particular extrusion equipment. Typically, the moisture content is adjusted by adding water using known methods and equipment. The original shape of the food analog is typically defined by the extruder die shape. In various embodiments, the food analog is further cut into pieces to produce food analog pieces or further processed to produce food analogs having varying properties, e.g., the appearance of a meat, vegetable, or fruit. When cut at the extruder, the length of each piece can be adjusted by adjusting the knives configuration and the knives rotation speed on the extruder. In various embodiments, one or more colorants are added at any step during or after production of the food analogs to provide a more natural/realistic appearance to the food analog. For example, one or more colorants can be added to the meat slurry to produce colored food analogs. In addition, one or more colorants can be added to the powder blend to produce colored food analogs. Similarly, one or more colorants can be added as part of a base including a vitamin or mineral premix to the meat slurry. In addition, one or more colorants can be added to the admixed meat slurry and powder blend before extruding. For instance, the colorants can be introduced into the extruder. Various combinations of these embodiments can be used to produce a food analog having the desired appearance. Suitable colorants include FD & C colors, natural colors, titanium dioxide, etc. The amount of colorant(s) to be added can range from about 0.01% to 10% by weight. Preferably, the amount of colorant(s) can range from about 0.5% to about 5% by weight depending on the colorants and the desired food analog to be obtained. In another aspect, the invention provides food analogs made using the methods of the invention. In another aspect, the invention provides food analogs. In various embodiments, the food analogs are a range of dry or semi-moist products that have the appearance of a cooked, roasted, or marinated food chunks that are steamed, baked, or grilled. The food analogs in the form of dry or semi-moist chunks have a real meat appearance, texture, and flavor. The food analogs have a high culinary aspect that corresponds to real meat and to various pet food products. In various embodiments, the food analogs correspond to roasted meat recipes such as beef loin cuts, beef round cuts, roast chicken, roast pork cuts, marinated chicken, marinated pork, and the like. In other embodiments, the food analogs have the appearance of various vegetables and fruits. The food analogs offer a new alternative to known pet food kibbles by providing pets and pet owners dry and semi-moist pet food products that resemble meaty chunks. The food analogs can be mixed together with dry pellets or kibbles as is done for soft meaty chunks or the food analogs may be sold alone as a meat analog for consumption. In other embodiments, the food analogs are combined with other dried foods such as dried vegetables (e.g., carrot, leeks, or beans). The meat used to make the meat slurry can be any suitable meat such as poultry, beef, pork, and lamb, especially those types of meats suitable for pets. The meat can include any additional parts of an animal, including offal. The flours can be derived from any suitable fruits or vegetables (e.g., potatoes, squash, zucchini, spinach, radishes, asparagus, tomatoes, cabbage, peas, carrots, spinach, corn, green beans, lima beans, broccoli, brussel sprouts, cauliflower, celery, cucumbers, turnips, yams, etc.) or grains (e.g., barley, rice, wild rice, brown rice, oats, millet, etc.). The flour can include any suitable spices (e.g., parsley, scallions, sage, rosemary, basil, thyme, chives, etc.) as desired to achieve the final food analog. In some embodiments, the invention provides food analogs that are meat analogs and the colorants are: (1) azorubine to produce a colored meat analog having a dark red appearance, (2) a combination of paprika and oleoresin to product a colored meat analog having a light red appearance, (3) a combination of titanium dioxide, allura red, and xanthane to produce a colored meat analog having a pink appearance, (4) a combination of titanium dioxide and xanthane to produce a colored meat analog having a white appearance, (5) a combination of poultry fat, plasma powder, xylose, and sodium monoglut to produce a colored meat analog having a dark brown appearance, or (6) a combination of dried egg yolk, caramel color, and starch to produce a colored meat analog having a light brown appearance. Depending on the type and amount of colorant, the meat analog can have an appearance similar to different types of cooked meat such as poultry, beef, or pork. In another embodiment, the colorant is titanium dioxide to produce a food analog having the appearance of fish. In other embodiments, the invention provides food analogs that are non-meat food analogs and the colorants are: (1) a combination of cataxanthine and xanthane to produce a non-meat food analog having an orange appearance, (2) a combination of dried egg yolk and tartrazine to produce a non-meat food analog having a yellow appearance, (3) a combination of titanium dioxide and riboflavine to produce a non-meat food analog having a light yellow appearance, (4) a combination of sodium copper chlorophyllin and titanium dioxide to produce a non-meat food analog having a pale green appearance, or (5) a combination of tartrazine, indigo carmine, and nitrited salt to produce a non-meat food analog having a green appearance. Depending on the type and amount of colorant, the non-meat food analog can have an appearance similar to a fruit or vegetable, e.g., potatoes, zucchini, apples, carrots, eggplant, and peppers. In various embodiments, the food analogs (with or without colorant added during the methods) further include one or more colorants added to the food analogs after extrusion to produce colorant coated food analogs. For example, after extrusion, a solution containing colorants and/or Maillard reaction precursors and/or meat/culinary flavour and/or ground meat dry powder can be sprayed on the food analog to obtain a heterogeneous roasted or marinated coloration as well as an appropriate flavor. The colorants are added to the food analog using any suitable application technique such as, for example, spraying, dipping, enrobing, panning, and the like. Spraying may be done in a continuous tumbler (e.g., post extrusion coating). Alternatively, or in addition to, a powder dusting system can heterogeneously stick some colored or reactive powders on the top the food analog after the post extrusion coating to improve the roasted appearance of the food analog. In various embodiments, the colorant coated food analog can be cut to produce cut colorant coated food analog pieces. The cut colorant coated food analog pieces can be dried to further improve the appearance of the colored food analog pieces. In an alternative embodiment, the colorant coated food analog can first be dried. After drying, the dried colorant coated food analog can then be cut to produce colored food analog pieces. The colorants added to the food analogs after extrusion are generally the same colorants added to the meat slurry, powder blend, meat slurry and powder blend admixture, and other ingredients before or during extrusion. The resulting food analogs are the same as very similar to the food analogs produced when the colorants are added before or during extrusion. One or more leavening agents are added or injected into the dough, preferably in the extruder. In comparison, if no leavening agents are added, the shape given by the die can be kept up to the end of the process, and the food analog may be elastic and rigid. If a leavening agent is injected in the extruder, the food analog can become puffed during the drying step. The initial shape of the food analog can change and more randomly distributed shapes are created giving more natural, less industrial chunky shapes. Furthermore, the puffed food analog's texture can become more aerated and flexible while retaining elasticity. The leavening agent is injected into the dough, in the extruder, to obtain puffed chunks of the food analog after extruding, drying and cooling. In an embodiment, the leavening agent is yeast. Alternatively, the leavening agent can be one or more of beer (e.g., unpasteurized-live yeast), buttermilk, ginger beer, kefir, sourdough starter, yogurt, baking powder, baking soda (e.g., sodium bicarbonate), monocalcium phosphate, sodium aluminum phosphate ("SALP"), sodium acid pyrophosphate ("SAPP"), phosphates, ammonium bicarbonate (e.g., hartshom, horn salt, bakers ammonia), potassium bicarbonate (e.g., potash), potassium bitartrate (e.g., cream of tartar), potassium carbonate (e.g., pearlash), hydrogen peroxide, nitrous oxide or a combination thereof. The food analogs may include other suitable ingredients such as, for example, preservatives, oral care ingredients, humectants, antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, or a combination thereof in any suitable amounts. The additional ingredients can further by using to promote a healthy lifestyle of an animal. The ingredients can be added at any suitable point during the food analog manufacturing process. The food analogs may also include one or more polyols (e.g., mono-propylene glycol or glycerol) or salt to lower the water activity of the finished product as well as preservatives to prevent mold growth. Suitable examples of preservatives include potassium sorbate, sorbic acid, methyl parahydroxybenzoate, calcium propionate and propionic acid. The oral care ingredients can provide breath freshening and/or tartar control. Suitable oral care ingredients include alfalfa nutrient concentrate (contains chlorophyll), sodium bicarbonate, phosphates (e.g., tricalcium phosphate, acid pyrophosphates, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, metaphosphates, orthophosphates), peppermint, cloves, parsley, ginger, etc. Suitable humectants include salt, sugars, propylene glycol and polyhydric glycols such as glycerin and sorbitol, and the like. Suitable antioxidants include butylated hydroxyanisole ("BHA") and butylated hydroxytoluene ("BHT"), vitamin E (tocopherols), etc. Suitable vitamins may include Vitamins A, B-complex (such as B-1, B-2, B-6 and B-12), C, D, E and K, niacin and acid vitamins such as pantothenic acid and folic acid and biotin. Suitable minerals may include calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, iodine, copper, phosphorus, manganese, potassium, chromium, molybdenum, selenium, nickel, tin, silicon, vanadium, and boron. In another aspect, the invention provides meat analogs in the form of meat analogs including one or more meats, one or more flours, and one or more colorants. The colorant(s) can be: (1) azorubine to produce a colored meat analog having a dark red appearance, e.g., the appearance of roasted beef or barbeque beef, (2) a combination of paprika and oleoresin to product a colored meat analog having a light red appearance, e.g., the appearance of cooked meat, roasted veal, roasted pork, marinated veal, or marinated pork, (3) a combination of titanium dioxide, allura red, and xanthane to produce a colored meat analog having a pink appearance, e.g., the appearance of cooked fish, roasted fish, salmon, or marinated fish, (4) a combination of titanium dioxide and xanthane to produce a colored meat analog having a white appearance, e.g., the appearance of lobster, shrimp, or fresh fish, (5) a combination of poultry fat, plasma powder, xylose, and sodium monoglutamate to produce a colored meat analog having a dark brown appearance, e.g., the appearance of roasted or marinated poultry, beef, veal, or pork liver, (6) a combination of titanium dioxide and riboflavine to produce a non-meat food analog having a light yellow appearance, e.g., the appearance of roasted chicken, roasted turkey, or barbeque chicken, or (7) a combination of dried egg yolk, caramel color, and starch to produce a colored meat analog having a light brown appearance, e.g., the appearance of marinated oven cooked beef. Any of the color combinations described herein for the meat analogs can also be used to provide non-meat food analogs based on the type, amount, or concentration of the added colors. For example, besides a meat analog, a combination of titanium dioxide and xanthane can be used to produce a colored non-meat food analog having a white appearance such as bread, cooked bread, or roasted bread. A combination of dried egg yolk, caramel color, and starch can be used to produce a colored non-meat food analog having a light brown appearance such as a biscuit.

The coloring solution injection flow was adjusted to obtain a coloring coating of approx 1%. The spray flow was irregular (pulsating compressed air injection) to produce an irregular and more natural like coloring of the extrudate pieces. Drying the Colored Extrudate Pieces At the exit of the tumbler coater, the extrudate pieces were transported to the dryer. The pieces were dried at 130°C during 15 to 30 minutes to obtain colored kibble with the aspect of grilled chicken meat pieces. The texture of the kibbles was soft and elastic. Kibble moisture was of about 16% and water activity of about 0.70. Making Slices of Colored Kibbles The colored kibble were then cut in a rotary knives cutter in a way to make slice of approx 0.1 to 0.1 inch (0.3 to 0.5 cm) of thickness and a diameter of approx 0.8 inch (2 cm). As shown in Figure 1, the final product has the appearance of grilled and minced chicken meat, Example 2 Example 1 was repeated except that the drier cutting step was omitted. As shown in Figure 2, the resulting product was in the form of kibble with wrinkled surface and had the appearance of roasted meat. Example 3 (comparative) Example 1 was repeated except that the yeast and powder blend used was replaced with the blend shown in Table 6.
