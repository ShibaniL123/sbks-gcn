Step 4: Preparation of (S)-3-(1-aminoethyl)-8-chloro-2-phenylisoquinoline-1(2H)-one
8.8 g (21.11 mmol) of tert-butyl (S)-(4-(3-chloro-2-(phenylcarbamoyl)phenyl)-3-oxobutane-2-yl)carbamate prepared in step 3 was dissolved in IPA/12 N HCl (5/3, 160 mL), followed by stirring at 65Â° C. for 2 hours. The mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure, to which saturated sodiumbicarbonate aqueous solution was added. The organic layer was extracted by using dichloromethane, which was separated, dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was separated by column chromatography (SiO2, eluent: CH2Cl2/MeOH, 10/1-CH2Cl2/MeOH, 5/1) to give 4.871 g of the target compound (S)-3-(1-aminoethyl)-8-chloro-2-phenylisoquinoline-1(2H)-one as a white solid (16.30 mmol, yield: 77%).
