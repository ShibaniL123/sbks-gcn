This invention relates to a novel indole alkaloid MO I, isolated from Moringa oleifera having anticancer activity. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION The state of art in the treatment of cancer include Chemotherapy that involves the administration of different chemical compounds either alone or in combination of more than one such compounds in treatment of cancer either inhibiting growth or killing cancer cells. The commonly employed chemically modified compounds like Paclitaxel from Pacific yew tree, Etoposide from Podophyllum tree, and Vincristin from Vinca plant, while other compounds like Cisplatin, Mitomycin, Daunarubicin, Adriamycin, Interferrons are also employed. Radiotherapy is another type of therapy involved to shrink and destroy tumors by damaging the genetic material, making further growth and division impossible for the cells. Cryotherapy is the creation of extreme cold environment using liquid nitrogen (or argon gas) which destroy abnormal tissue and used to treat external tumors, such as those on skin. Immunotherapy is the utilization of toxin tagged with monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of cancer. The most important drawback of all the above therapies is that, these harm healthy cells and damage different organs like heart, lungs, nerves, kidneys, or reproductive organs ultimate causing death. Other side effects include anemia, loss of appetite, hemorrhage, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, fluid retention, hair loss, infertility, mouth and throat changes, nausea and vomiting, pain, sexual changes, skin and nail changes, eye changes, urinary, kidney, and bladder changes. Plants have a long history of use in the treatment of cancer. Plants-derived compounds have been an important source of several clinically useful anticancer agents. Numerous plant -derived compounds including vinblastin, vincristine, camptothecin derivatives, topotecan and irinotecan, etoposide, derived from epipodophyllotoxin, and paclitaxel (taxol) are used in cancer chemotherapy but most exhibit cell toxicity and can induce genotoxic, carcinogenic and teratogenic effect in non-tumor cells. These side effects limit the use of chemotherapeutic agents despite their high efficacy in treating target malignant cells. Therefore, the search for alternative drugs that are both effective and non-toxic in the treatment of cancers is an important research line. Moringa oleifera syn. M. pterigosperma Hindi: Mungna Mar.: Shevgi A small or medium sized tree, about 10 m high, found wild in subhimalayan tract, from Chenab eastward to Sarda, and cultivated all over the plains in India. Bark thick, soft, corky, deeply fussered: young part tomentose; leaves usually tri-pinnate: leaflets elliptic; flowers white fragrant, in large penicles; pods pendulous, greenish, 22.5-50.0 cm or more in length, triangular, ribbed; seeds trigonous with wings on angles. The prior art reveals that no anticancer agent have been isolated from the said plant. OBJECT OF INVENTION The main object of the present invention is to isolate new indole alkaloid MO I, isolated from the bark of Moringa oleifera having anticancer activity. DETAILS OF THE INVENTION The process comprises drying, grinding, and hot defatting of M. oleifera bark with lower polarity organic solvent. This is followed by the successive sequential hot extraction with the organic solvents. The solvents are then removed under vacuum preferably at a temperature in the range of 35-40°C. The hydroalcoholic crude extract obtained thereby is then subjected to column chromatography in chronological order of polarity of solvent starting with petroleum ether. The methanolic fraction showing similar pattern in TLC are mixed together and concentrated in vacuum under reduced pressure to get light brown colour new alkaloid. The crystal is washed to free form any adhere impurities. The crystals are dried and subjected to identification by spectrophotometric methods such as UV, IR, NMR and Mass. The isolated, purified and characterized new alkaloid is subjected to MTT Assay and Capsase-3 activity using cancerous cell line. In an embodiment of the present invention the organic solvent used for defatting the bark of M. oleifera is selected from the group consisting of petroleum ether, hexane, benzene, toluene and dichloromethane. In yet another embodiment the polar organic solvent used for the extraction of defatted M. oleifera is selected from the group consisting of ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol and methanokwater (1:1). In yet another embodiment the organic solvent used for the washing adhere impurities is acetone. In yet another embodiment the extract use for the column chromatography is hydroalcoholic extract, select on the basis of antiproliferative and antioxidant potential. In yet another embodiment the gradient elution of column chromatography is carried out form the using a solvent selected from the group consisting of petroleum ether, benzene, chloroform, ethyl acetate, acetone, methanol, water and a mixture thereof. In yet another embodiment the yield of new indole alkaloid MO I obtained is in the range of 0.5-5%. In yet another embodiment the new indole alkaloid obtained is biologically activity agent against human cancer disease. In yet another embodiment the alkaloid obtained is useful as anti cancer agent but limited to cervix (SiHa).
