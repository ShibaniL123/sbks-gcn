2-((3,5-dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)amino)-2-oxoethyl 2-(2-isopropyl-1H-indol-1-yl)acetate
Step 1: 2-isopropyl-1 H-indole
A mixture of phenylhydrazine (0.428 mL, 4.0 mmol) and 3-methyl-2-butanone (0.425 mL, 4.0 mmol) was heated to 70 °C. After 4 h, H2O (0.3 mL) and concentrated H2SO4 (1.3 mL) was added and this mixture was heated at 70 °C. After 14 h, the reaction mixture was quenched into 5% Na2CO3 (100 mL) and diluted with Et2O (100 mL). The two layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with Et2O (100 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (50 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. Purification by column chromatography (5% EtOAc in PE) gave 192 mg (30%) of the title compound
