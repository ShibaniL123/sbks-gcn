Field of the Invention The present invention generally relates to multi-piece golf balls having a multi-layered solid core and cover of at least one layer. In one preferred embodiment, a five-piece ball is formed. The center of the core is made of a thermoset rubber material. Three intermediate layers of thermoplastic material enclose the center. The outer cover layer is made of a composition comprising a polyurethane, polyurea, or copolymer or blend thereof. 2. Brief Review of the Related Art Multi-piece, solid golf balls are used today by recreational and professional golfers. Basically, these golf balls contain an inner core protected by a durable cover. The core and cover may be single or multi-layered. For example, three-piece golf balls having an inner core, an inner cover layer, and an outer cover layer may be used. In other instances, golfers will use a four-piece ball containing a dual-core (inner core and surrounding outer-core layer) and dual-cover (inner cover layer and surrounding outer cover layer). Five and six-piece balls may be made with intermediate layer(s) disposed between the inner core and outer cover. Normally, the core is made of a natural or synthetic rubber material such as, for example, styrene butadiene, polybutadiene, or polyisoprene; and the cover is made of a durable material such as, for example, ethylene acid copolymer ionomer resins, polyamides, polyesters, polyurethanes, or polyureas. Today, the industry is interested, among other things, in making balls that can rebound faster, retain more total energy when struck with a club, and have longer flight distance. In recent years, golf ball manufacturers have looked to developing multi-layered core and cover constructions. Golf balls containing multi-layered cores and covers are generally described in the patent literature. For example, Bulpett et al, US Patent Application Publication US 2009/0227394 discloses multi-layered core construction comprising: a) an inner core formed from a first thermoset rubber composition; b) an intermediate core layer formed from a partially-neutralized or highly-neutralized ionomer composition; and c) an outer core formed from a second thermoset rubber composition. A cover layer having a thickness of about 0.01 to 0.05 inches and a surface hardness of about 60 Shore D or less is formed around the core. Sullivan et al., US Patent Application Publication No. US 2009/0017940 discloses golf balls having a dual-core and a single-layered cover. The dual-core includes an inner core formed from a rubber composition and an outer core layer formed from a highly neutralized polymer (HNP) composition comprising an ethylene acid copolymer. In the HNP composition, at least 80% of all acid groups are neutralized. The inner core has an outer surface hardness of less than 80 Shore C; the outer core layer has an outer surface hardness of 56 Shore D or greater; and the cover layer has a material hardness of 60 Shore D or less. Sullivan et al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,357,736 and 7,211,008 disclose golf balls comprising: a) an inner core layer formed from a diene rubber composition; (b) an outer core layer formed from a high modulus highly neutralized polymer (HNP) comprising a highly neutralized ethylene/(meth)acrylic acid copolymer having a modulus of from 45,000 psi to 150,000 psi; (c) an intermediate core layer disposed between the inner core layer and the outer core layer and formed from a low modulus HNP composition comprising a highly neutralized ethylene/(meth)acrylic acid/alkyl (meth)acrylate copolymer having a modulus of from 1,000 psi to 50,000 psi. In the HNP compositions, at least 80% of all acid groups are neutralized. Higuchi et al., U.S. Pat.

Nesbitt et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,147,578 discloses golf balls containing a dual-core. The inner core (center) and outer core layer may be formed from a thermoset material or a thermoplastic material. The '578 patent discloses suitable thermoset materials as including polybutadiene or any natural or synthetic elastomer, metallocene polyolefins, polyurethanes, silicones, polyamides, and polyureas. Suitable thermoplastic materials are described as including ionomers, polyurethane elastomers, and combinations thereof. Higuchi et al., U.S. Pat. No. 7,086,969 discloses a multi-piece golf ball comprising dual-core having a center and outer core layer; and a dual-cover having an inner cover layer and outer cover layer. The center is made from a rubber composition and has a JIS-C hardness of 40 to 60 in its center and a JIS-C hardness of 55 to 75 on its surface. The outer core also is made of rubber and has a JIS-C surface hardness of 75 to 95. The inner cover layer has a Shore D hardness of 50 to 80, and the outer cover layer has a Shore D hardness of 35 to 60. Iwami, U.S. Pat.

Although some conventional multi-layered core and cover constructions are generally effective in providing golf balls having good playing properties, there is a continuing need for improved core and cover constructions in golf balls. Particularly, there is a need for balls having high resiliency and other properties that will allow players to generate higher initial ball speed and less initial ball spin when driving the ball off the tee. This will allow players to achieve longer distance on their driver shots. The present invention provides multi-layered golf balls having such properties as well as other advantageous features and benefits.

In another particular embodiment, the Shore C hardness of the outer core layer's outer surface (Hcenter surface) is greater than the Shore C material hardness of the inner cover layer (Hinner cover material). If an intermediate core layer is present, the outer surface hardness of the intermediate core layer (Hintermediate core surface) is preferably 83 Shore C or greater, 85 Shore C or greater, or the outer surface hardness is within a range having a lower limit of 83, 86, 87, 89 or 91 Shore C and an upper limit of 90 or 91 or 95 or greater Shore C.

For purposes of the present disclosure, the outer surface hardness of the intermediate core layer (Hintermediate core surface) is measured according to the procedure given herein for measuring the outer surface hardness of a golf ball layer. The intermediate core layer preferably has a material hardness (Hintermediate cover material) of 98 Shore C or less, or 96 Shore C or less, or 95 Shore C or less, or 93 Shore C or less, or has a material hardness (Hinner cover) within a range having a lower limit of 80 or 83 or 84 or 85 or 87 Shore C and an upper limit of 89 or 90 or 91 or 92 or 95 or 97 or 99 Shore C. In one preferred embodiment, the (Hintermediate core material) is greater than the material hardness of the outer core layer (Houter core material). In another preferred embodiment, the (Hintermediate core surface) is greater than the surface hardness of the outer core layer (Houter core surface). The hardness of the intermediate core layer is described in further detail below. Methods for Measuring Hardness of Core Layers For purposes of the present disclosure, the center hardness of the inner core layer (Hcenter) is obtained according to the following procedure. The core is gently pressed into a hemispherical holder having an internal diameter approximately slightly smaller than the diameter of the core, such that the core is held in place in the hemispherical portion of the holder while concurrently leaving the geometric central plane of the core exposed. The core is secured in the holder by friction, such that it will not move during the cutting and grinding steps, but the friction is not so excessive that distortion of the natural shape of the core would result. The core is secured such that the parting line of the core is roughly parallel to the top of the holder. The diameter of the core is measured 90 degrees to this orientation prior to securing. A measurement is also made from the bottom of the holder to the top of the core to provide a reference point for future calculations. A rough cut is made slightly above the exposed geometric center of the core using a band saw or other appropriate cutting tool, making sure that the core does not move in the holder during this step. The remainder of the core, still in the holder, is secured to the base plate of a surface grinding machine. The exposed ‘rough’ surface is ground to a smooth, flat surface, revealing the geometric center of the core, which can be verified by measuring the height from the bottom of the holder to the exposed surface of the core, making sure that exactly half of the original height of the core, as measured above, has been removed to within ±0.004 inches. Leaving the core in the holder, the center of the core is found with a center square and carefully marked and the hardness is measured at the center mark according to ASTM D-2240. Additional hardness measurements at any distance from the center of the core can then be made by drawing a line radially outward from the center mark, and measuring the hardness at any given distance along the line, typically in 2 mm increments from the center. The hardness at a particular distance from the center should be measured along at least two, preferably four, radial arms located 180° apart, or 90° apart, respectively, and then averaged. All hardness measurements performed on a plane passing through the geometric center are performed while the core is still in the holder and without having disturbed its orientation, such that the test surface is constantly parallel to the bottom of the holder, and thus also parallel to the properly aligned foot of the durometer. For purposes of the present disclosure, the outer surface hardness of a golf ball layer is measured on the actual outer surface of the layer and is obtained from the average of a number of measurements taken from opposing hemispheres, taking care to avoid making measurements on the parting line of the core or on surface defects, such as holes or protrusions. Hardness measurements are made pursuant to ASTM D-2240 “Indentation Hardness of Rubber and Plastic by Means of a Durometer.” Because of the curved surface, care must be taken to insure that the golf ball or golf ball subassembly is centered under the durometer indentor before a surface hardness reading is obtained. A calibrated, digital durometer, capable of reading to 0.1 hardness units is used for all hardness measurements and is set to take hardness readings at 1 second after the maximum reading is obtained. The digital durometer must be attached to, and its foot made parallel to, the base of an automatic stand. The weight on the durometer and attack rate conform to ASTM D-2240. For purposes of the present disclosure, a hardness gradient of a golf ball layer is defined by hardness measurements made at the outer surface of the layer and the inner surface of the layer. “Negative” and “positive” refer to the result of subtracting the hardness value at the innermost surface of the golf ball component from the hardness value at the outermost surface of the component. For example, if the outer surface of a solid core has a lower hardness value than the center (i.e., the surface is softer than the center), the hardness gradient will be deemed a “negative” gradient. Thermoplastic layers of golf balls disclosed herein may be treated in such a manner as to create a positive or negative hardness gradient, as disclosed, for example, in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/939,632, filed Nov. 14, 2007; Ser. No. 11/939,634, filed Nov. 14, 2007; Ser. No. 11/939,635, filed Nov. 14, 2007; and Ser. No. 11/939,637 filed Nov. 14, 2007.

Cover Structure In one embodiment, the two-layer or three-layer core is enclosed with a dual-cover comprising an inner cover layer and an outer cover layer. According to the present invention, the surface hardness of the outer core layer's outer surface is greater than the material hardness of the inner cover layer. In a particular embodiment, the surface hardness of the outer core layer's outer surface (Houter core surface) is greater than the material hardness of both the inner cover layer (Hinner cover material) and the outer cover layer (Houter cover material). It should be understood that there is a fundamental difference between “material hardness” and “hardness as measured directly on a golf ball.” For purposes of the present disclosure, material hardness is measured according to ASTM D2240 and generally involves measuring the hardness of a flat “slab” or “button” formed of the material. Hardness as measured directly on a golf ball (or other spherical surface) typically results in a different hardness value. This difference in hardness values is due to several factors including, but not limited to, ball construction (i.e., core type, number of core and/or cover layers, etc.), ball (or sphere) diameter, and the material composition of adjacent layers. It should also be understood that the two measurement techniques are not linearly related and, therefore, one hardness value cannot easily be correlated to the other. Unless otherwise stated, the material hardness values given herein for cover materials are measured according to ASTM D2240, with all values reported following 10 days of aging at 50% relative humidity and 23° C. The inner cover layer preferably has an outer surface hardness (Hinner cover surface) of 96 Shore C or less, or an outer surface hardness within a range having a lower limit of 80 or 85 or 87 Shore C and an upper limit of 90 or 91 or 95 or 97 or 98 Shore C.

The outer cover layer preferably has a material hardness (Houter cover material) of 85 Shore C or less. The thickness of the outer cover layer is preferably within a range having a lower limit of 0.010 or 0.015 or 0.020 or 0.025 inches and an upper limit of 0.035 or 0.040 or 0.050 or 0.055 or 0.080 inches.

Thus, when the intermediate cover layer is present, the multi-layered cover includes an inner cover layer, intermediate cover layer, and outer cover layer as shown in FIG. 3. The intermediate cover layer preferably has an outer surface hardness (Hintermediate cover surface) of 85 Shore C or more, or an outer surface hardness within a range having a lower limit of 83, 86, 87, 89 or 91 Shore C and an upper limit of 90 or 91 or 95 or greater Shore C. As measured in Shore D, the outer surface hardness (Hintermediate cover surface) is 50 Shore D or more and is within a range having a lower limit of 50, 53, 55, 57, 60, 61, or 63 and an upper limit of 60, 62, 63, 65, 67, 70, 72, 73, or 75 Shore D. For purposes of the present disclosure, the outer surface hardness of the intermediate cover layer (Hintermediate cover surface) is measured according to the procedure given herein for measuring the outer surface hardness of a golf ball layer.

Manufacturing Processes The present invention is not limited by any particular process for forming the golf ball layer(s). It should be understood that the layer(s) can be formed by any suitable technique, including injection molding, compression molding, casting, and reaction injection molding. When injection molding is used, the composition is typically in a pelletized or granulated form that can be easily fed into the throat of an injection molding machine wherein it is melted and conveyed via a screw in a heated barrel at temperatures of from 150° F. to 600° F., preferably from 200° F. to 500° F. The molten composition is ultimately injected into a closed mold cavity, which may be cooled, at ambient or at an elevated temperature, but typically the mold is cooled to a temperature of from 50° F. to 70° F. After residing in the closed mold for a time of from 1 second to 300 seconds, preferably from 20 seconds to 120 seconds, the core and/or core plus one or more additional core or cover layers is removed from the mold and either allowed to cool at ambient or reduced temperatures or is placed in a cooling fluid such as water, ice water, dry ice in a solvent, or the like. When compression molding is used to form a core, the composition is first formed into a preform or slug of material, typically in a cylindrical or roughly spherical shape at a weight slightly greater than the desired weight of the molded core. Prior to this step, the composition may be first extruded or otherwise melted and forced through a die after which it is cut into a cylindrical preform. The preform is then placed into a compression mold cavity and compressed at a mold temperature of from 150° F. to 400° F., preferably from 250° F. to 400° F., and more preferably from 300° F. to 400° F. When compression molding a cover layer, half-shells of the cover layer material are first formed via injection molding. A core is then enclosed within two half-shells, which is then placed into a compression mold cavity and compressed. Reaction injection molding processes are further disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,083,119, 7,208,562, 7,281,997, 7,282,169, 7,338,391, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0247073, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Golf Ball Properties Golf balls of the present invention typically have a coefficient of restitution (“COR”) of 0.700 or greater, preferably 0.750 or greater, more preferably 0.780 or greater, and even more preferably 0.790 or greater. COR, as used herein, is determined according to a known procedure wherein a golf ball or golf ball subassembly (e.g., a golf ball core) is fired from an air cannon at two given velocities and calculated at a velocity of 125 ft/s. Ballistic light screens are located between the air cannon and the steel plate at a fixed distance to measure ball velocity. As the ball travels toward the steel plate, it activates each light screen, and the time at each light screen is measured. This provides an incoming transit time period inversely proportional to the ball's incoming velocity. The ball impacts the steel plate and rebounds though the light screens, which again measure the time period required to transit between the light screens. This provides an outgoing transit time period inversely proportional to the ball's outgoing velocity. COR is then calculated as the ratio of the outgoing transit time period to the incoming transit time period, COR=Vout/Vin=Tin/Tout. Golf balls of the present invention typically have an overall compression of 40 or greater, or a compression within a range having a lower limit of 40 or 50 or 60 or 65 or 75 or 80 or 90 and an upper limit of 95 or 100 or 105 or 110 or 115 or 120. Dual cores of the present invention preferably have an overall compression of 60 or 70 or 75 or 80 and an upper limit of 85 or 90 or 95 or 100. Inner core layers of the present invention preferably have a compression of 40 or less, or from 20 to 40, or a compression of about 35. Compression is an important factor in golf ball design. For example, the compression of the core can affect the ball's spin rate off the driver and the feel. As disclosed in Jeff Dalton's Compression by Any Other Name, Science and Golf IV, Proceedings of the World Scientific Congress of Golf (Eric Thain ed., Routledge, 2002) (“J. Dalton”), several different methods can be used to measure compression, including Atti compression, Riehle compression, load/deflection measurements at a variety of fixed loads and offsets, and effective modulus. For purposes of the present invention, “compression” refers to Atti compression and is measured according to a known procedure, using an Atti compression test device, wherein a piston is used to compress a ball against a spring. The travel of the piston is fixed and the deflection of the spring is measured. The measurement of the deflection of the spring does not begin with its contact with the ball; rather, there is an offset of approximately the first 1.25 mm (0.05 inches) of the spring's deflection. Very low stiffness cores will not cause the spring to deflect by more than 1.25 mm and therefore have a zero compression measurement. The Atti compression tester is designed to measure objects having a diameter of 42.7 mm (1.68 inches); thus, smaller objects, such as golf ball cores, must be shimmed to a total height of 42.7 mm to obtain an accurate reading. Conversion from Atti compression to Riehle (cores), Riehle (balls), 100 kg deflection, 130-10 kg deflection or effective modulus can be carried out according to the formulas given in J. Dalton. In FIG. 4, one version of a finished golf ball that can be made in accordance with this invention is generally indicated at 65. Various patterns and geometric shapes of dimples 75 can be used to modify the aerodynamic properties of the golf ball 65 as needed. Golf balls of the present invention will typically have dimple coverage of 60% or greater, preferably 65% or greater, and more preferably 75% or greater. The United States Golf Association specifications limit the minimum size of a competition golf ball to 1.680 inches. There is no specification as to the maximum diameter, and golf balls of any size can be used for recreational play. Golf balls of the present invention can have an overall diameter of any size. The preferred diameter of the present golf balls is from 1.680 inches to 1.800 inches. More preferably, the present golf balls have an overall diameter of from 1.680 inches to 1.760 inches, and even more preferably from 1.680 inches to 1.740 inches. Golf balls of the present invention preferably have a moment of inertia (“MOT”) of 70-95 g·cm2, preferably 75-93 g·cm2, and more preferably 76-90 g·cm2. For low MOT embodiments, the golf ball preferably has an MOT of 85 g·cm2 or less, or 83 g·cm2 or less. For high MOT embodiment, the golf ball preferably has an MOT of 86 g·cm2 or greater, or 87 g·cm2 or greater. MOT is measured on a model MOI-005-104 Moment of Inertia Instrument manufactured by Inertia Dynamics of Collinsville, Conn. The instrument is connected to a PC for communication via a COMM port and is driven by MOI Instrument Software version #1.2. The present invention relates generally to golf balls containing at least one component made from a thermoplastic non-ionomer composition and at least one component made from a thermoplastic ionomer composition. When numerical lower limits and numerical upper limits are set forth herein, it is contemplated that any combination of these values may be used. All patents, publications, test procedures, and other references cited herein, including priority documents, are fully incorporated by reference to the extent such disclosure is not inconsistent with this invention and for all jurisdictions in which such incorporation is permitted. While the illustrative embodiments of the invention have been described with particularity, it will be understood that various other modifications will be apparent to and can be readily made by those of ordinary skill in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, it is not intended that the scope of the claims appended hereto be limited to the examples and descriptions set forth herein, but rather that the claims be construed as encompassing all of the features of patentable novelty which reside in the present invention, including all features which would be treated as equivalents thereof by those of ordinary skill in the art to which the invention pertains. 1.
