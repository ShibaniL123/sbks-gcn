Step 4. tert-Butyl 6,8-difluoro-7-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline-2(1H)-carboxylate
To a solution of tert-butyl 6,8-difluoro-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline-2(1H)-carboxylate (3.76 g, 13.96 mmol) in THF (100.0 ml) under N2 at −78° C. was added a solution of LDA (1.0 M in THF/hexanes) (36.0 ml, 36.0 mmol) dropwise via syringe over a period of 40 mins. The reaction was allowed to warm to −60° C. and stirred for 60 mins. The reaction was then cooled back to −78° C. 2-Isopropoxy-4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane (10.52 ml, 51.5 mmol) was added slowly over a period of 20 min. After stirring at −78° C. for 20 min, the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 2 h. The reaction mixture was quenched with sat. NaHCO3, and extracted with Et2O. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified on silica gel (120 g, 0-50% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the desired product as a white solid (4.11 g, 75%).
