Title: Dispensing Apparatus Description of Invention This invention relates to cleaning apparatus including a receptacle, in particular a bucket, and a dispenser for dispensing detergent into the receptacle. It is common practice for detergent, i.e. a cleansing agent, to be added to water in a receptacle, e.g. a bucket, to assist in cleaning a surface, for example a floor. The detergent often has a number of purposes, for example to kill bacteria on the surface being cleaned and/or a cleaning tool which is rinsed in the receptacle, and to aid in flocculation of dirt particles such that the majority of the cleaning water in the receptacle is maintained in a cleaner state during cleaning. It is advantageous for the correct amount or ‘dose’ of detergent to be added to the water in the receptacle, and this depends upon the strength of the detergent and the overall volume of liquid held by the receptacle. However, it is typical for the amount of detergent to be added to the receptacle in an arbitrary way, rather than for a user to measure the amount to be added. Typically, too much detergent is used, which is uneconomical, and can leave a residue on a surface, which can lead to slips and falls in the case of floors, and damage to the surface. It is known in the art to provide a moulded chamber in a wringer, which includes an orifice through which detergent may flow, under gravity, into the bucket. An example of such a chamber is disclosed in my earlier United Kingdom patent GB2419518. A disadvantage of the proposed solution of GB2419518 is that the size of the orifice is determined by the viscosity of the detergent, such that it is possible for the detergent to be held in the chamber for a long enough period to be measured before flowing into the bucket. However, it will be apparent that it is desirable to be able to use a bucket and its associated detergent dispenser with different types of detergent, which may have different viscosities. A further disadvantage is that a wringer may be adapted to fit different sized buckets, and yet the chamber for measuring the detergent is of a fixed size. In some circumstances, the chamber obstructs the positioning of other devices which it is desirable to fit adjacent a wringing apparatus. In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a cleaning apparatus including a receptacle and a dispenser for detergent, the dispenser being pivotable relative to the receptacle, to dispense detergent into the receptacle. The dispenser may be positioned at or near the top of the receptacle. The dispenser may be positioned above the receptacle. The volume of the dispenser may be determined by the volume of the receptacle. The volume of the dispenser may be determined by the type of detergent to be used with the cleaning apparatus. The dispenser may include at least one indication of volume. The receptacle may be a bucket. The cleaning apparatus may include a wringing apparatus having a body for receiving mop material and a moveable member which is operable to wring liquid from mop material which is received in the body, and wherein the dispenser is positioned on the moveable member, such that movement of the moveable member dispenses the detergent into the receptacle. The dispenser may be attached to the receptacle. The dispenser may be operable to dispense detergent in the form of a liquid into the receptacle. The dispenser may be operable to dispense detergent in the form of a powder or crystals into the receptacle. The dispenser may be shaped to pour the detergent into the receptacle. The dispenser may include a spout or chute formation. The dispenser may be replaceable with an alternative dispenser. The volume of the dispenser may be modifiable. According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided, a method of cleaning, including placing detergent into a dispenser of a cleaning apparatus and pivoting the dispenser relative to a receptacle of the cleaning apparatus to dispense the detergent into the receptacle. Where the dispenser is positioned upon a moveable part of a wringing apparatus of the cleaning apparatus, the method may include operating the wringing apparatus to move the moveable member, to dispense detergent into the receptacle. The method may include selecting the volume of the dispenser in accordance with the volume of the receptacle and/or the type of detergent to be dispensed. The invention will now be described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying drawings, of which: FIGURE 1A is a perspective view of a cleaning apparatus, including a wringing apparatus in a first position. FIGURE 1Β is a perspective view of the cleaning apparatus of figure 1Α with the wringing apparatus in a second position; FIGURE 2Α is a perspective view of the wringing apparatus of the cleaning apparatus of Figures 1Α and 1Β, in the first position; and FIGURE 2Β is a second perspective view of the wringing apparatus, in the second position. Referring to the figures, there is shown a cleaning apparatus 10 including a receptacle 12 in the form of a bucket, and a wringing apparatus 14. The bucket 12 includes a body which, in use, holds a volume of liquid. The bucket 12 has an upper rim 16 defining an opening 18. The bucket 12 preferably includes at least one indication of the volume of liquid held when filled to a marking on the interior or exterior of the bucket 12. The bucket 12 may include a plurality of such indications, to indicate different volumes. The wringing apparatus 14 includes a wringer body 20 in which mop material is receivable, and a wringing mechanism 24. The wringer body 20 includes at least one aperture, through which liquid may pass into the bucket 12. The wringing mechanism 24 includes an operating handle 26, which is rotatable about an axis 28 relative to the wringer body 20 to move a wringer plate 30 which has a front face 30a and a rear face 30b, relative to the wringer body 20, so as to decrease the volume of the wringer body 20 in which mop material is receivable. The wringer plate 30 is rotatable relative to the wringer body 20 between a first position, and a second, wringing position. The wringer plate 30 carries a dispenser 32. The dispenser 32 is a cup having an upper rim at least part of which extends outwardly of the rear face 30b of the wringer plate 30. The cup is substantially frusto-conical, and the rim is preferably shaped to channel detergent into a stream during dispensing. The dispenser 32 includes a flange 36 which is connectable to the wringer plate 30. In the present example, a part of the flange 36 is receivable in an aperture 38 in the wringer plate 30. The dispenser extends partially through the aperture 38. The majority of the rim of the cup extends outwardly of the rear face 30b, but a part of the rim extends outwardly of the front face 30a of the wringer plate 30. Fixings 40 are provided to hold the dispenser in the required position relative to the wringer plate 30. It will be appreciated that the dispenser 32 may be push-fit engageable with the aperture 38, rather than fixings being used. Alternatively, the wringer plate 30 may not include an aperture, and the dispenser 32 may be connected to the rear face 30b of the wringer plate 30, for example by way of fixings. Further alternatively, the dispenser 32 and the wringer plate may include corresponding formations, for example at least a part of the flange 36 may be slidably receivable in a channel formation attached to the wringer plate 30. The dispenser preferably includes an indication of the volume of liquid held in the cup when filled to a particular level. The dispenser may include a plurality of such indications, indicating different volumes. The dispenser 32 is replaceable with alternative dispensers which may have different volumes. Dispensers may be colour-coded, so that it is possible to quickly identify an appropriate dispenser for use in a particular cleaning apparatus, or in conjunction with a particular detergent. In use, the wringing apparatus 14 is positioned towards the top of the bucket 12, as shown in Figure 1, such that liquid may drain from the wringing apparatus 14, under gravity, into the bucket 12, during and/or after operation of the wringing apparatus 14 to remove liquid from mop material. In Figure 2Α, the wringing apparatus 14 is shown oriented such that the wringer plate 30 is in a first, generally upright position. With the wringer pate 30 in its first position, the dispenser 32 is oriented with the rim of its cup facing generally upwardly. A user is able to fill the cup with detergent, to a desired level, which may be to its brim, or to an appropriate level which is dependent upon the detergent being used and the volume of water (or other cleaning fluid) in the bucket 12. The user may fill the dispenser 32 from the front or the rear of the wringer plate 30. The user is easily able to identify the desired volume of detergent which should be used and achieve the desired volume without difficulty, particularly, but not exclusively, when one or more volume indicators are provided in or on the dispenser 32. The risk of over-use of detergent is thus mitigated. When the user desires to add the detergent to the bucket, either before or after filling the bucket with water (or other cleaning liquid), the user rotates the operating handle 26. This rotates the wringer plate 30 to a second position, in which the rim of the cup of the dispenser 32 is oriented generally downwardly, towards a base of the body 20 of he wringing apparatus 14. The detergent in the cup is thus tipped out of the dispenser, into the wringer body 20, and drains from the wringer body 20 into the bucket 12. It will be appreciated that the dispenser 32 may be positioned relative to the wringer body 20 and the bucket 12 such that detergent in the dispenser 32 is dispensed directly into the bucket 12, rather than via the wringer body 20. The shape of the cup of the dispenser facilitates pouring the detergent out of the dispenser 32. An advantage of the present invention is that the addition of detergent to the bucket 12 can be controlled very accurately. The volume is controlled by the volume of the dispenser 32, and the timing of the addition of the detergent to the bucket is controlled by the user. Once the user decides to add the detergent, this can be done quickly, there is no need for the detergent to drain through a small metering orifice, as in previous proposals. The viscosity of the detergent is largely unimportant, provided that the viscosity of the detergent is low enough to allow the detergent to flow from the dispenser under gravity. By attaching the dispenser 32 to a part of the wringing apparatus, no additional moving parts are required, and the dispenser 32 does not obstruct the positioning of other parts of the cleaning apparatus 10. The dispenser 32 does not obstruct the wringing mechanism 24 when it used to wring mop material 22. The dispenser 32 may be positioned on an alternative part of the cleaning apparatus, for example another part of the wringing apparatus 14, for example the wringer handle 26, or a roller or a wringer including a roller rather than a plate. Alternatively the dispenser 32 may be positioned the bucket 12, for example within the bucket volume. In the latter case, the dispenser 32 would be mounted for movement between a first, substantially upright position in which the dispenser 32 may be filled, and a second, dispensing position to dispense detergent into the volume of the bucket 12. It is possible to include one or more gears to control pivotal movement of the dispenser 32 relative to the bucket 12 by virtue of movement of the wringer handle 26. In the event that the cleaning apparatus 10 is to be used for a different purpose, and the type of detergent is changed, and/or the volume of cleaning liquid to be held in the bucket 12 is altered, the dispenser 32 is detachable from the wringer plate 30 (or bucket 12), and replaceable with an alternative dispenser, for example of a different volume. The dispenser 32 may have an alternative shape from the cup shape shown in the drawings. For example, the dispenser may have an opening through which the dispenser may be filled with detergent, and may have a spout through which the dispenser 32 dispenses detergent into the bucket 12. The spout may be positioned so as not to dispense detergent into the bucket 12 until the dispenser has been pivoted relative to the bucket 12. For example, an opening of the spout may open generally upwardly, when the dispenser 32 is in the first, substantially upright position. The opening of the dispenser 32 may have a cap of cover to inhibit contamination of the detergent and/or refilling/partial refilling of the dispenser 32. The opening may include a funnel formation for ease of filling the dispenser 32. When used in this specification and claims, the term “detergent” encompasses any cleansing agent.
