Example 11
To a suspension of 6-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one (0.100 g, 0.408 mmol) and 2-cyano-1,3-thiazole-5-carboxylic acid (0.069 g, 0.448 mmol), and pyridine (0.15 mL, 1.832 mmol) in acetonitrile (4 mL) in a sealed tube was added propylphosphonic anhydride solution (50 wt % in ethyl acetate, 0.85 mL, 1.432 mmol). The sealed tube was heated to 48.5Â° C. for 4 days and the precipitation formed. After cooling, the precipitated solid was collected by filtration and washed with cold dichloromethane to give 2-cyano-N-(4-(2-oxo-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinolin-6-yl)thiazol-2-yl)thiazole-5-carboxamide (0.073 g, 47%) as a yellow solid.
