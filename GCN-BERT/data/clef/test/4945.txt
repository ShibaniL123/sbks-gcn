Preparation of 4-isobutoxybenzonitrile
4-Hydroxybenzonitrile (59.6 g, 0.5 mol), potassium carbonate (276.4 g, 2.0 mol), potassium iodide (33.2 g, 0.2 mol) are mixed with dimethylformamide (1 L). 1-Bromo-2-methyl propane (217.5 ml, 2.0 mol) is added to the resulting suspension at 70° C. The alkylation reaction is performed at 70° C. for 6 hours. The resulting reaction mixture is filtered in order to remove inorganic salts from the reaction mixture. The filtrate is concentrated to about 300 ml. The residue is mixed with water and methyl tert-butyl ether. The organic phase is separated, washed with saturated brine and dried over magnesium sulfate. After concentrating the solution is purified by silica gel column chromatography (5-7% ethyl acetate/hexanes) to give 4-iso-butoxybenzonitrile (84.6 g, 96.5%).
