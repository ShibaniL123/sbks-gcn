The present invention relates to herbal composition, and more particularly, to a herbal composition for inducing better milk secretion in dairy animals such as cattle. Background of Invention Humans are an exception to the fact that they consume milk beyond infancy. As a result of the increasing population, the consumption of milk has increased and shall continue to rise in the coming years. This has lead to the necessity of inducing milk secretion in dairy cattle, which has been an ongoing challenge. Tremendous amount of research has been undertaken in this field. A range of chemical preparations are being used, but are known to have side - effects or bad long term effects on the health and milk secretion ability of the animal. Herbal preparations are considered comparatively safer for the cattle. Various herbal formulations have been developed in order to achieve increased milk secretion. However, these suffer from individual drawbacks. Most of these are broken down in the rumen and prove to be ineffective. Other formulation lead to a change in the contents of the milk produced. Object of the Invention An object of this invention is to achieve an increased secretion of milk in animals such as dairy cattle through an herbal formulation. Another object of the invention is to provide an herbal composition which avoids breaking of the contents in the rumen. Yet another object of the invention is to provide an herbal composition prevent any side effects caused by consumption of the said herbal formulation. Summary of the Invention Accordingly, the present invention provides a herbal composition to achieve an increased secretion of milk in mammals, the herbal composition comprising tubers of ipomoea digitata 60-80% rice 30-40 %; and water. In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of preparing the herbal composition to achieve an increased secretion of milk in mammals, the method comprising: mixing tubers of ipomoea digitata with rice in a ration 2:1; boiling the mixture with water; crushing the boiled mixture; and filtering the crushed mixture to form a herbal composition Detailed Description of the Invention: The foregoing objects of the present invention are accomplished and the problems and shortcomings associated with the prior art, techniques and approaches are overcome by the present invention as described below in the preferred embodiments. The present invention provides an herbal composition to achieve an increased secretion of milk in mammals such as dairy cattle. In accordance with the present invention the herbal composition is a therapeutic mixture having a part of ipomoea digitata and about half the part of rice in quantity. The herbal composition in accordance with the present invention comprises tubers of the herb ipomoea digitata in about 60-80% and rice in about 30-40%. In an embodiment, the ratio of the ipomoea digitata tubers to rice is 2:1. The ipomoea digitata belongs to family of sweet potato. In another aspect, the present invention provides, a method of preparing the herbal composition comprising mixing tubers of ipomoea digitata and rice. The quantity of the rice added is half the quantity of the tuber of ipomoea digitata. Thereafter, the method includes boiling the above-mentioned mixture with water, wherein water acts as the fundamental platform. In one embodiment of the present invention the boiled contents are filtered. In another embodiment the boiled contents are crushed and/or filtered. The formed composition benefits in increasing the lactation of diary animals. Further, the composition does not contribute to any side effects. The composition is for an internal use and needs to be fed once for at least fifteen days. It may be obvious to those skilled in the art that the herbal composition may also include the tuber of plants belonging to the same family of sweet potato which depends on the response of the dairy animal to the earlier composition. However, the mixture must contain a starchy ingredient and water acting as the platform for mixing. The present invention provides for increased secretion of milk in dairy animal such as cattle. The breaking of the contents in the rumen is also avoided. This enhances the efficiency of the method and prevents any side effects caused by consumption of the said herbal formulation. The foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of the present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the present invention to the precise forms disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the present invention and its practical application, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the present invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is understood that various omission and substitutions of equivalents are contemplated as circumstance may suggest or render expedient, but such are intended to cover the application or implementation without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention.
