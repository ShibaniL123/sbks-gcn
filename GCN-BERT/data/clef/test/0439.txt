Determination: referencing the standard of CSSI 2008 version, using a agar two times dilution method, determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC values). 2. Testing bacterial strain Feces enterococci (VSE clinical isolates: MEFA 0039); Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP: ATCC 49619). 3. Positive control drug is vancomycin hydrochloride. MIC values of some compound are shown in Table 3.

Compared with the positive control of vancomycin, the activity of series compounds I against enterococci is comparable to vancomycin or is weaker than vancomycin; and the activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae is superior to vancomycin. Wherein, the activity of compounds I14 and I9 against streptococcus pneumoniae is more four times than vancomycin. So it is worthy for further modification and pharmacological activity.
