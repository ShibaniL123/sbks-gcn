BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The invention relates to a floor cleaning apparatus according to the preamble of claim 1 and to a method for cleaning a floor using the same according to the preamble of claim 27. 2. Description of the Related Art An apparatus for cleaning a floor surface is known from U.S. Pat. No. 5,901,410 WINDMEISSER. This known cleaning apparatus is suitable for wet cleaning and comprises a front suction unit in front of the brushing means and a rear suction unit behind the brushing means. Fresh cleaning liquid is supplied to the brushing means from a first tank in either travel direction. The front suction unit and the rear suction unit both extend parallel to the brushing means and are both connected to a second tank. The cleaning liquid is sucked up by the rear suction unit when the cleaning apparatus is moved in forward travel direction and sucked up by the front suction unit when the cleaning apparatus is moved in a backward travel direction. A drawback of this known device is that both suction units are always active in either travel direction of the cleaning apparatus but only one of the front and rear suction units is used to suck up the cleaning liquid applied to the floor via the brushing means. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the invention to provide a floor cleaning apparatus which has a front and a rear suction unit and which permits to either increase the vacuum applied to a suction unit or to increase the suction volume flow rate without changing the vacuum turbine power. The invention solves the posed problem with a floor cleaning apparatus comprising the features of claim 1 as well as with a method for cleaning a floor using the same and comprising the features of claim 27. The advantages of the floor cleaning apparatus according to the invention are essentially to be seen in the facts that: during a movement of the cleaning apparatus in the forward travel direction the front suction channel is closed and the entire suction performance of the vacuum turbine is concentrated on the rear suction unit. Due to the closed front suction channel the suction volume flow rate is reduced and thus an increased vacuum in the rear suction channel can be achieved when the cleaning apparatus is moved in forward travel direction;during a movement of the cleaning apparatus in the backward travel direction the front suction unit opens so that the front suction unit and the rear suction unit actively suck up cleaning liquid resulting in a combined high suction volume flow rate; anda vacuum turbine can therefore be used which has a constant suction power when either both suction units are simultaneously active thus allowing a high suction volume flow rate or when the rear suction unit is active only thus allowing a high vacuum. In a special embodiment the closing member closes the front suction channel when the cleaning apparatus is moved in a forward travel direction. In another embodiment the closing member opens the front suction channel when the cleaning apparatus is moved in a backward travel direction. Due to this configuration the front suction channel can be opened or closed by simply changing the travel direction of the cleaning apparatus. In a further embodiment the rear suction unit comprises a rear suction channel which remains open during both movements of the cleaning apparatus in the forward and backward travel direction. This configuration permits the advantage that because the rear suction channel is open in either travel direction the suction volume flow rate of the cleaning unit can simply be increased by moving the cleaning apparatus in the backward travel direction. In a further embodiment the front suction channel comprises a suction opening which is open towards a floor to be cleaned over the entire length of the front suction unit and the closing member closes the suction opening of the front suction channel when the cleaning apparatus is moved in a forward travel direction and opens the suction opening when the cleaning apparatus is moved in a backward travel direction. By this means a simple configuration of the closing member is achievable. In another embodiment the front suction channel comprises a suction opening which is open towards a floor to be cleaned and the closing member comprises a lip with a front section which frontally limits the suction opening along its entire length and a rear section which rearwardly limits the suction opening along its entire length. By this means the advantage can be achieved that the front section of the lip can be used to close or open the suction opening of the front suction channel. Preferably, the closing member is actuated by frictional forces acting on the front section of the lip due to a sliding movement of the same on a floor to be cleaned when the cleaning apparatus is moved in the forward travel direction of the cleaning apparatus or in the backward travel direction of the cleaning apparatus. The advantage of this configuration can be seen therein that the closing member can be actuated without any auxiliary drive or device and must not be separately actuated by the operator. Preferably, the lip is made of a resilient material permitting the advantage that the front section of the lip is biased into its initial configuration where the front suction opening is opened. In a further embodiment the front section of the lip has a vertical height HF and the rear section of the lip has a vertical height HR and wherein HF is larger than HR so that the front section is bendable across the suction opening. By this means the advantage can be achieved that when the cleaning apparatus is moved in the forward travel direction the front section of the lip is bent under the rear section so that consequently the suction slot is closed and only minimal or no suction is effected by the front suction unit. When the cleaning apparatus is moved in the backward travel direction the front section of the lip initially contacts the floor to be cleaned and is pushed oppositely to the backward travel direction, i.e. towards the front end of the cleaning apparatus so that the suction slot of the front suction unit is opened and the front suction bar fulfills in this condition the function of a standard suction bar. Preferably, the front section of the lip is bendable as far as a portion of the front section extends below the rear section so that the suction opening of the front suction channel can be completely closed. In a further embodiment the rear suction unit comprises a rear suction channel and both of the front suction channel and the rear suction channel are connected to a manifold so as to be in fluid connection with a single vacuum turbine. The advantage of this configuration is that the cleaning apparatus can be operated with a single vacuum turbine. Preferably, the cleaning unit comprises a first electric driving motor for the vacuum turbine and at least a second electric driving motor for the at least one brush. In again a further embodiment the front suction unit and the rear suction unit extend transverse to the forward and backward travel direction of the cleaning apparatus. Preferably, when measured orthogonal to a vertical middle plane of the cleaning apparatus the front suction unit and the rear suction unit each have a length which is equal to or larger than a dimension of the at least one brush orthogonal to the vertical middle plane. In another embodiment the cleaning apparatus further comprises a brush housing and the rear suction unit is attached to the brush housing by means of a resilient connecting device allowing the rear suction unit to move laterally with respect to the chassis against an elastic resistance provided by the resilient connecting device. Preferably, the resilient connecting device comprises an elastic connector which forms a pivot joint affixed to the brush housing by means of a fastener. Preferably, the pivot joint has an axis of rotation extending essentially vertically. In another embodiment the rear suction unit comprises a curved suction bar, preferably an essentially elliptically curved suction bar. In a further embodiment the resilient connecting device comprises an elongated bracket having a first end affixed to the rear suction unit and a second end attached to the brush housing by means of an elastic connector. Preferably, the elongated bracket is biased in a position of rest by means of the elastic connector wherein when in the position of rest the elongated bracket extends along a forward or backward travel direction of the cleaning apparatus. In a further embodiment the at least one brush is rotatable about a rotational axis extending essentially vertically. In another embodiment the cleaning apparatus further comprises a handlebar which is suitable to move the cleaning apparatus on a floor to be cleaned. Preferably, the rear suction unit is arranged in front of the rear wheels. This configuration permits the advantage that when moving the cleaning apparatus in a forward travel direction the rear wheels move outside of the wet area of the floor to be cleaned. In a further embodiment the cleaning apparatus further comprises a first tank which is attached to the chassis and which is configured as a receptacle with its smallest dimension X extending vertically with respect to the forward and backward travel direction of the cleaning apparatus. Preferably, the cleaning apparatus further comprises a second tank which is arranged in the rear portion of the cleaning apparatus and which is configured as a receptacle having a smallest dimension Z in the forward or rearward travel direction of the cleaning apparatus. In another embodiment the cleaning apparatus can further comprise an elongated member which extends from the rear end of the chassis, wherein the second tank is attachable to the elongated member. Preferably, one end of the elongated member is rotatably affixed to the chassis by means of a hinge. This configuration permits the advantage that the elongated member with the second tank attached thereto can be backwardly rotated about the rotational axis of the hinge so as to permit to clean the floor under a table.

FIGS. 1 to 4 illustrate an embodiment of the cleaning apparatus 1 for wet cleaning of a floor 12. The cleaning apparatus 1 essentially comprises a front portion 16, a rear portion 17 with two lateral rear wheels 3, a chassis 2 and a cleaning unit 4 attached to the chassis 2. Exemplarily, the cleaning apparatus 1 can be provided with a handlebar 6 which is suitable to move the cleaning apparatus 1 on a floor 12 to be cleaned. Alternatively, the cleaning apparatus 1 can be driven by a motor and controlled by the operator by means of control means attached to the cleaning apparatus 1 or can be controlled by a remote control. The handlebar 6 can be attached to the chassis 2 by means of an essentially vertically extending elongated member 9, e.g. a post so that the handlebar 6 permits to move the cleaning apparatus 1 manually in a forward and a backward travel direction. In various embodiments of the cleaning apparatus 1 according to the invention the cleaning unit 4 can comprise one or more brushes 20. Exemplarily, but not limiting, the embodiment of the cleaning apparatus 1 illustrated in FIGS. 1 to 5 is provided with a cleaning unit 4 comprising two brushes 20. The two brushes 20 are rotatably attached to a brush housing 22. The brushes 20 are rotatable about a rotational axis 21 each. The brushes 20 can for example, but not limited to, be arranged with their rotational axes 21 extending vertically on opposite sides of the vertical middle plane 18 and essentially vertically to the forward and backward travel direction of the cleaning apparatus. Alternatively, the one or more brushes 20 can be arranged with their rotational axes 21 extending horizontally in a lateral direction of the cleaning apparatus 1. Further, the cleaning unit 4 can comprise a first tank 15, a second tank 13, preferably two rotatable brushes 20 and a suction device 25 permitting to suck up the dirty cleaning liquid. The first tank 15 is used for fresh water supply while the second tank 13 is used as a recovery water tank into which the dirty cleaning water sucked up from the floor 12 can be delivered by means of the suction device 25 via the flexible tube 33. Furthermore, the cleaning unit 4 can comprise a first electric driving motor (not shown) for driving the vacuum turbine 5 and a second and third electric driving motor (not shown) each for driving one of the two brushes 20. The cleaning apparatus 1 can be provided with a battery 35, preferably a lithium-ion battery to supply the electric driving motors with electric energy. The two brushes 20 can rotate with opposite senses of rotation. Preferably, the first tank 15 is configured as a fresh water tank and the second tank 13 is configured as a recovery water tank. Furthermore, the first tank 15 can be detachably affixed to the chassis 2 by means of a quick fixing device and the second tank 13 can be detachably affixed to the elongated member 9 by means of a quick fixing device. The first tank 15, i.e. the fresh water tank is connected to a piping and/or flexible tube system (not shown) so as to allow water to flow from the first tank 15 via a nozzle 45 (FIG. 2) to each one brush 20. The brushes 20 are arranged in front of the rear wheels 3 in the front portion 16 of the cleaning apparatus 1 and protrude from the lower side 19 of the chassis 2 so as to be contactable with the floor 12 to be cleaned. The brush housing 22 can be attached to the chassis 2 at the lower side 19 thereof. The suction device 25 can comprise a front suction unit 8 arranged in front of the brushes 20, a rear suction unit 7 arranged rearward of the at least one brush 20 and a vacuum turbine 5 which is operatively connected to the front suction unit 8 and to the rear suction unit 7. Each of the front and rear suction units 8, 7 can be attached to the brush housing 22. The front suction unit 8 can be configured as a linear suction bar and can comprises a front suction channel 29 and a closing mechanism 26 which closes the front suction channel 29 when the cleaning apparatus 1 is moved in a forward travel direction. The two brushes 20, the front suction unit 8 and the rear suction unit 7 define a floor contact region 44 for contacting the floor 12 to be cleaned when the cleaning apparatus 1 is in a working position as illustrated in FIG. 1. The closing mechanism 26 opens the front suction channel 29 when the cleaning apparatus 1 is tilted backwards so as to raise the floor contact region 44 relative to the rear wheels 3. Apart from this the closing mechanism 26 opens the front suction channel 29 when the cleaning apparatus 1 is moved in a backward travel direction. Furthermore, the rear suction unit 7 comprises a rear suction channel 30 which is open during movement of the cleaning apparatus 1 in the forward and the backward travel directions. By this means the suction volume flow rate of the cleaning unit 4 can simply be increased by moving the cleaning apparatus 1 in the backward travel direction while the vacuum applied to the rear suction unit 7 can be increased by moving the cleaning apparatus 1 in the forward travel direction in which the front suction unit 8 is closed. The front suction channel 29 comprises a suction opening 24 which is open towards a floor 12 to be cleaned over the entire length of the front suction unit 8. The closing mechanism 26 can be configured in such a way that it closes the suction opening 24 of the front suction channel 29 when the cleaning apparatus 1 is moved in a forward travel direction and opens the suction opening 24 when the cleaning apparatus 1 is moved in a backward travel direction. For this purpose the closing mechanism 26 can comprise a lip 41 which can be configured as a plastic or rubber gasket, wherein the lip 41 can have a front section 27 (FIGS. 3 and 4) which frontally limits the suction opening 24 along its entire length and a rear section 28 which rearwardly limits the suction opening 24 along its entire length. When the cleaning apparatus 1 is moved forward or backward in its working position with the floor contact region 44 contacting the floor 12 to be cleaned the closing mechanism 26 is actuated, i.e. closed and/or opened by frictional forces acting on the front section 27 of the lip 41 due to a sliding movement of the front section 27 on the floor 12 to be cleaned when the cleaning apparatus is moved in its forward travel direction, i.e. with the front portion 16 of the chassis 2 ahead or in the backward travel direction, i.e. with the rear portion 17 of the chassis 2 ahead. Preferably, the front section 27 and the rear section 28 of the lip 41 are made of a resilient material. By this means the front section 27 of the lip 41 can be biased into its initial configuration where the front suction opening 24 is opened when the floor contact region 44 including the lip 41 is lifted from the floor 12 to be cleaned. The front section 27 of the lip 41 has a vertical height HF protruding from the bottom of the brush housing 22 and the rear section 28 of the lip 41 has a vertical height HR protruding from the bottom of the brush housing 22. Thereby, HF is larger than HR so that the front section 27 of the lip 41 is bendable across the suction opening 24 of the front suction channel 29. Upon moving the cleaning apparatus 1 in the forward travel direction the front section 27 of the lip 41 is bent under the rear section 28 and the suction slot 24 is closed. Upon moving the cleaning apparatus 1 in the backward travel direction the front section 27 of the lip 41 is pushed towards the front end 38 of the cleaning apparatus 1 so that the suction slot 24 of the front suction unit 8 is opened. Preferably, the front section 27 of the lip 41 is bendable as far as a portion of the front section 27 extends below the rear section 28 of the lip 41 so as to completely close the suction opening 24 of the front suction channel 29. The front suction unit 8 and the rear suction unit 7 extend transverse to the forward and backward travel direction of the cleaning apparatus 1 and—when measured orthogonal to a vertical middle plane 18 of the chassis 2—the front suction unit 8 and the rear suction unit 7 each have a length which is equal to or larger than a dimension of the two brushes 20 orthogonal to the vertical middle plane 18. Further, the rear suction unit 7 comprises a rear suction channel 30 and both of the front suction channel 29 and the rear suction channel 30 are connected to a manifold 31 so as to be in fluid connection with a single vacuum turbine 5. The vacuum turbine 5 is configured to create sufficient vacuum for active suction of the cleaning liquid in a forward and backward movement of the cleaning apparatus 1. The cleaning apparatus 1 is configured so that in a forward movement the entire vacuum performance is concentrated on the rear suction device 7. This due to the fact that during a forward movement the front section 27 of the lip 41 prevents any airflow at the front suction device 8. During backward movement the front suction unit 8 allows airflow and actively suck up of cleaning liquid. During backward movement both suction units front 8 and back 7 actively suck up cleaning liquids. As illustrated in FIGS. 1-3 the suction device 25 comprises a rear suction unit 7 which is attached to the brush housing 22 by means of a resilient connecting device 10 permitting the rear suction unit 7 to move laterally with respect to the chassis 2 against an elastic resistance provided by the resilient connecting device 10. The resilient connecting device 10 can comprise an elongated bracket 46 having a first end 49 affixed to the rear suction unit 7 and a second end 50 attached to the brush housing 22 by means of an elastic connector 11. The first end 49 of the elongated bracket 46 can be Y-shaped to provide a rigid fixation of the rear suction unit 7. The elastic connector 11 preferably forms a pivot joint affixed to the brush housing 22 by means of a fastener 47, wherein the pivot joint has an axis 42 of rotation extending vertically with respect to a forward or backward travel direction of the cleaning apparatus 1. The elastic connector 11 can consist of a plastic or rubber. The outer periphery of the elastic connector 11 can be polygonally configured to prevent rotation between the elastic connector 11 and the elongated bracket 46 or can be rotationally stable affixed to the elongated bracket 46 by an adhesive or any other means known to the skilled person. By means of the elastic connector 11 the elongated bracket 46 is biased in a position of rest in which the elongated bracket 46 extends along a forward or backward travel direction of the cleaning apparatus 1. The rear suction unit 7 can be rearwardly spaced apart from the brush housing 22 by a spacing of minimum 30%, preferably minimum 35% of the diameter of one of the brushes 20. Due to the fact that the elongated bracket 46 is elastically attached to the brush housing 22 the rear suction unit 7 can follow the path of the brushes 20 when the cleaning apparatus 1 is moved along a curved path or can be elastically pressed against a vertical wall when the cleaning apparatus 1 is moved along this wall closely enough to elastically press the rear suction unit 7 out of its position of rest against the elastic resistance provided by the elastic connector 11. Preferably, the rear suction unit 7 comprises a curved suction bar extending on an arc around a rear portion of the two brushes 20 so that the brushes are partially encircled. In embodiments of the cleaning apparatus 1 with two brushes the rear suction unit 7 is preferably configured as an essentially elliptically curved suction bar to fit better around a portion of the rear periphery of the pair of brushes 20. Further, each a stopper pin 43 can be mounted on the top side of the brush housing 22 on either side of the vertical middle plane 18 so as to limit the swiveling motion of the bracket 11. Preferably, the stopper pins 43 limit the swiveling motion of the bracket 11 within an angle of maximum ±60°, preferably of maximum ±45° and of minimum ±30°, preferably of minimum ±35°. As best seen in FIG. 5 the first tank 15 is attachable to the chassis 2 and is configured as a receptacle with its smallest dimension X extending vertically with respect to the forward and backward travel direction of the cleaning apparatus 1. Further, the cleaning apparatus 1 can comprise an elongated member 9 which extends from the end of the chassis 2 to the handlebar 6, wherein the second tank 13 is attachable to the elongated member 9. The second tank 13 has a smallest dimension Z extending essentially perpendicular to a plane defined by the elongated member 9 and the handlebar 6. One end of the elongated member 9 can be rotatably affixed to the chassis 2 by means of a hinge 39 having a rotational axis 40 extending in the lateral direction of the cleaning apparatus 1. By this means the elongated member 9 with the second tank 13 attached thereto can be backwardly rotated about the rotational axis 40 of the hinge so as to permit to clean the floor 12 under a table or under a bench. The elongated member 9 can be adjustable and loosenably securable at a selected angle between −90° and +90° with respect to a horizontal plane. Thus, the elongated member 9 with the second tank 13 attached thereto can be rotated from an essentially vertical position which is suitable to put aside the cleaning apparatus 1 on a minimum space to a horizontal position permitting a reduced overall height of the complete cleaning apparatus 1. The brushes 20 and the rear suction unit 7 define a floor contact region 44 when the cleaning apparatus 1 is in a working position and the first tank 15 can extend vertically with respect to the floor contact region 44 to a level of maximum 40 cm, preferably maximum 35 cm. In a preferred embodiment each of the first and second tanks 15, 13 can have a volume of typically 9 liters. In one embodiment the cleaning apparatus 1 can additionally comprise a mechanical actuation device (not shown), preferably a lever hoist to rotate the elongated member 9 about the rotational axis 40 of the hinge 39. By this means the weight of the second tank 13 must not be manually lifted or lowered by the user during an adjustment of the elongated member 9 with the second tank 13 attached thereto from a vertical position to a horizontal position or vice versa. The weight of the second tank 13 can be lifted or lowered by means of the mechanical actuation device. Preferably, the first tank 15 longitudinally extends over the front and the rear portion 16, 17 of the cleaning apparatus 1 so as to have a maximum horizontal cross-sectional area. The first tank 15 can taper towards the front end 38 of the chassis 2 to achieve a low front portion 16 of the cleaning apparatus 1 suitable to clean the floor 12 under e.g. a bench.
