Step 3
4-(3-Methylisoxazol-5-yl)benzyl methanesulfonate
[4-(3-Methylisoxazol-5-yl)-phenyl]-methanol (70.0 mg, 0.370 mmol) and triethylamine (112 mg, 1.11 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous dichloromethane (5mL). Methanesulfonyl chloride (83.0 mg, 0.740 mmol) was added at 0°C. The reaction solution was slowly warmed to 25°C and stirred for 2 hours. The reaction was quenched with aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (10 mL), extracted with dichloromethane (10 mL x 3), the combined organic phases were washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 4-(3-methylisoxazol-5-yl)benzyl methanesulfonate (80.0 mg, as a yellow oil) with a yield of 82%. MS-ESI [M + H]+ calcd. 268, found 268.
