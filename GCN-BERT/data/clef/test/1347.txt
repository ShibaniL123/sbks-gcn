The copyright owner has no objection to the facsimile reproduction by anyone of the patent document or patent disclosure as it appears in the Patent and Trademark Office, patent file or records, but otherwise reserves all copyright rights whatsoever. FIELD OF THE INVENTION One or more embodiments of the invention generally relate to sleep masks. More particularly, the invention relates to a single use sleep mask. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The following background information may present examples of specific aspects of the prior art (e.g., without limitation, approaches, facts, or common wisdom) that, while expected to be helpful to further educate the reader as to additional aspects of the prior art, is not to be construed as limiting the present invention, or any embodiments thereof, to anything stated or implied therein or inferred thereupon. It is believed that some individuals may suffer from low quality of sleep and potential myriad related health problems due to exposure to light while sleeping or attempting to sleep. This problem may be mismanaged due to lack of understanding of how sensitive the human body's circadian rhythm, or sleep-wake cycle, can be to even minimal amounts of light. The following is an example of a specific aspect in the prior art that, while expected to be helpful to further educate the reader as to additional aspects of the prior art, is not to be construed as limiting the present invention, or any embodiments thereof, to anything stated or implied therein or inferred thereupon. By way of educational background, an aspect of the prior art generally useful to be aware of is that some devices are currently available for shielding a user's eyes from light such as, but not limited to, sleep masks. Prior art sleep masks are typically made of cloth or synthetic fiber and are generally intended for more than one use. Current sleep masks are often held in place with elastic bands or straps that wrap behind the head and attach with means such as, but not limited to, hook and loop material, snaps, buttons, etc. Often, the materials used in these currently available sleep masks do not completely block out all light and therefore may not replicate the effects of a completely dark environment, which may be needed for restful sleep. Also, skin and/or scalp irritation may be caused by single use or repeat use due to materials used in the mask or by the bands or straps that hold the mask on a user's head. Furthermore, an uncomfortable sensation of pressure on the face or head may result from the tension created by the elastic bands or straps behind the head. These bands or straps may also alter the contact point of the head with the sleeping surface, for example, without limitation, a pillow, mattress, or chair. In view of the foregoing, it is clear that these traditional techniques are not perfect and leave room for more optimal approaches.

As is well known to those skilled in the art many careful considerations and compromises typically must be made when designing for the optimal manufacture of a commercial implementation any system, and in particular, the embodiments of the present invention. A commercial implementation in accordance with the spirit and teachings of the present invention may configured according to the needs of the particular application, whereby any aspect(s), feature(s), function(s), result(s), component(s), approach(es), or step(s) of the teachings related to any described embodiment of the present invention may be suitably omitted, included, adapted, mixed and matched, or improved and/or optimized by those skilled in the art, using their average skills and known techniques, to achieve the desired implementation that addresses the needs of the particular application. It is to be understood that any exact measurements/dimensions or particular construction materials indicated herein are solely provided as examples of suitable configurations and are not intended to be limiting in any way. Depending on the needs of the particular application, those skilled in the art will readily recognize, in light of the following teachings, a multiplicity of suitable alternative implementation details. An embodiment of the present invention provides a single use, opaque to light sleep mask that is held in place with tape. Some embodiments comprise a single mask to cover both eyes, and other embodiments comprise separate strips for each eye. Some embodiments may enable users to block out all natural and artificial light and achieve restful sleep no matter the time of day, without the use of medication or the need for modifications to their living space. Sleep masks according to some embodiments may be single use, lightweight, comfortable, opaque to light, adhesive strips that allow a user to replicate the benefits of a light free nighttime environment when artificial light is in use or during the daylight hours. FIGS. 1A and 1B illustrate an exemplary baseline strip 100 for a light blocking sleep mask system, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 1A is an exploded view of baseline strip 100, and FIG. 1B is a transparent top view of baseline strip 100. In the present embodiment, baseline strip 100 comprises a gauze layer 105, an electrical tape layer 110, and a paper tape layer 115. Non-adhesive gauze 105 is affixed to the adhesive side of adhesive paper tape 115. Paper tape 115 is only adhesive on one side. Electrical tape 110, which is also adhesive on only one side, is affixed by the adhesive side to the non-adhesive side of paper tape 115. Referring to FIG. 1B, this creates a layered strip with gauze 105 at the bottom, paper tape 115 in the middle, and electrical tape 110 on the top. Baseline strip 100 is compressed to generally eliminate any gaps between gauze 105, paper tape 115 and electrical tape 110. Gauze 105 is smaller in area than paper tape 115 to create an adhesive margin 120 around gauze 105. Margin 120 typically enables strip 100 to be adhered to a user's face. It is contemplated that the margin around the gauze in some embodiments may be larger or smaller depending on various factors such as, but not limited to, the overall size of the baseline strip, the size of the gauze area, the type of user for which the strip is intended, for example, without limitation, adults or children, etc. In the present embodiment, electrical tape 110 acts as a light blocking material. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize, in light of and in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, that a multiplicity of suitable materials may be used as the light blocking layer in some alternate embodiments such as, but not limited to, vinyl bundling tape, duct tape, thick fabrics, various plastics, etc. In the present embodiment, referring to FIG. 1B, a tactile marker 125 is placed on the top, non-adhesive side of electrical tape 110. A multiplicity of suitable means may be used to create marker 125 such as, but not limited to, a stamped slight depression in electrical tape 110, a slightly raised ridge on electrical tape 110, a textured area, a raised button, tab, or nub adhered or otherwise attached to electrical tape 110, etc. Marker 125 indicates the central aspect of gauze 105 at the most medial or inner aspect of gauze 105. Again, referring to FIG. 1B, once assembled, baseline strip 100 may be placed on a non-adhesive plastic backing 130 that typically does not degrade the adhesive capability of paper tape 115. This generally allows for long-term storage of strip 110. Plastic backing 130 may be affixed to gauze 105 without leaving a sticky surface on gauze 105 after removal plastic backing 130. In some embodiments the plastic backing may only be affixed to paper tape 115 and not the rest of strip 100. A non-adhesive tab for strip 100 may be created by folding a portion of paper tape 115 back onto itself so that each side of this tab is non-adhesive. Alternative to or in addition to this non-adhesive tab, plastic backing 130 may be made longer than paper tape 115 to aid in removing strip 100 from backing 130. In typical use of the present embodiment, a user requires two baseline strips 100 for each use, one strip 100 for each eye. The use of one strip 100 per may enable the eyes to be more effectively shielded from light as strips 100 may achieve a tighter seal around the eyes as opposed to a single strip model that covers both eyes. The use of one strip 100 per eye may also be more comfortable for the user. Strips 100 are typically applied one at a time, as the user may need to use both hands to apply each strip 100. In some instances, strips may be applied with one hand. If provided, the user grips the non-adhesive tab of strip 100 with the hand that matches the eye where the strip is being applied. For example, without limitation, if strip 100 is being applied to the left eye, the non-adhesive tab is gripped with the left hand. If no tab is provided, the user grips an outer edge of strip 100. One finger of the other hand may be placed over tactile marker 125. The user guides tactile marker 125 to the innermost or medial aspect of the eye with gauze 105 facing the eye. It is contemplated that some alternate embodiments may be implemented without a tactile marker. In typical use of these embodiments, the user may place the strip over the eye while taking care that the gauze is located over the eye. In the present embodiment, once strip 100 is in a satisfactory position, the user may affix paper tape 115 to the skin surrounding the eye, starting medially, then moving laterally, and then moving up and down. Once the user is satisfied that a light opaque seal has been achieved for the first eye by pressing down gently on paper tape 115, the above steps may be repeated for the other eye. When the user is ready to remove strips 100, strips 100 are typically removed one eye at a time. To remove strip 100, the non-adhesive tab or an edge of strip 100 is grasped, and then strip 100 is slowly peeled off moving from lateral to medial, outer to inner, reversing the direction of application. This slow removal may minimize trauma to skin and eyebrows. Once removed, strip 100 may be thrown away, and a fresh strip may be used the next time the user would like to shield his or her eyes from light. Those skilled in the art will readily recognize, in light of and in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, that a multiplicity of suitable methods may be used to apply and remove strips to and from a user's eyes. For example, without limitation, the user may affix paper tape 115 to the skin around the eye starting from the outer or lateral aspect of the eye and moving inward and may remove strips starting from the medial aspect moving outward. The present embodiment may provide the complete blocking of light from the eyes and may help to maximize the possibility of restful sleep. Strip 100 may be used in almost any setting where the user is trying to sleep. Furthermore, strip 100 may be used at any time of day. If desired, the user may put sunglasses on over strips 100 if being used in a public place. It is believed that various different types of users may be able to benefit from the use of these light blocking strips including, without limitation, individuals with insomnia, current users of medication for a sleep disorder, current users of the myriad number of purported sleep-inducing compounds such as, but not limited to, oral melatonin, city dwellers exposed to high levels of ambient light at night, night shift workers with difficulty adjusting their circadian rhythm, anyone exposed to artificial light in the hours before attempting to sleep, etc. In typical use of the present embodiment, the only materials which contact the user's skin and eyes are typically paper tape 115 and gauze 105. The use of these materials and the lightweight nature of strip 100 may allow for regular and comfortable use of strip 100 over the course of the entire night even in users with sensitive skin. Also, using non-adhesive gauze 105 as the point of contact with the eye may reduce irritation to the eye as eyelid skin is thin and can be very sensitive and typically allows the eyelashes to remain unaffected when strip 100 is removed. Moreover, the single use design of strip 100 may minimize skin and scalp irritation caused by repeated use as oils from the skin and dead skin cells are not repeatedly brought back into contact with the user's skin. The use of adhesive paper tape 115 typically eliminates the need for elastic bands or straps which may minimize the uncomfortable sensation of pressure on the face and may help to eliminate the altered contact point created by currently available sleep masks. Strip 100 may also allow the user to sleep on his or her back or sides with equal comfort. If included, without limitation, the non-adhesive tab and tactile marker 125 help the user to easily apply and remove strip 100 without sticking to the user's fingers. If desired, in some applications, baseline strips 100 may be used in conjunction with supplementary strips to provide a light free environment for the user. Supplementary strips are strips which are smaller than baseline strip 100. These supplementary strips may be equal in length to baseline strip 100 yet are narrower than baseline strip 100 or may be equal in width to baseline strip 100 yet shorter than baseline strip 100. Manufacture of the supplementary strips is similar to that of baseline strip 100 as described by way of example in the foregoing. These supplementary strips may enable the user to block out all light if the unique shape of his or her face does not allow baseline strip 100 to create a completely light opaque environment. Use of the supplementary strips involves the user placing one or more supplementary strips over any areas where light is visible at the margin of baseline strip 100 in especially light intense environments or in situations where the user has a facial shape that does not allow for creation of a light opaque seal based on use of baseline strip 100 alone. It is contemplated that supplementary strips may be available in a multiplicity of suitable shapes including, without limitation, rectangles, rounded shapes, irregular shapes, etc. Furthermore, those skilled in the art will readily recognize, in light of and in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, that the baseline strips in some embodiments may be implemented in a multiplicity of suitable shapes. For example, without limitation, some embodiments may comprise strips with round, elliptical or irregular shapes to closely fit the shape of the orbital area. Other embodiments may be implemented as a one-piece mask rather than two baseline strips, as illustrated by way of example in FIG. 2. FIG. 2 is a diagrammatic top view of an exemplary one-piece, single use, disposable sleep mask 200, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In the present embodiment, sleep mask 200 is substantially opaque to light. Sleep mask 200 comprises a piece of double sided gauze that is cut to size and covered with electrical tape on one side. The electrical tape acts as a light blocking layer. It is contemplated that various different materials may be used as the light blocking layer in some alternate embodiments such as, but not limited to, duct tape, thick fabrics, various plastics, etc. In the present embodiment, a gap 205 may be fashioned in mask 200 to accommodate a user's nose. Paper tape strips 210 extend laterally from either side of mask 200. Some embodiments may comprise longer strips of paper tape that are oriented horizontally and/or vertically. In the present embodiment, mask 200 is affixed gauze side down to a thin plastic backing 215. Plastic backing 215 may provide single use dispensing of mask 200. Plastic backing 215 may be affixed to the gauze side of mask 200 without leaving a sticky surface on the gauze after mask 200 is separated from plastic backing 215 or may be affixed to paper tape strips 210 only. After being separated from plastic backing 215, paper tape strips 210 are still sticky, typically allowing for adhesion to a user's skin. In some embodiments, these paper tape strips may comprise a small tab of folded back tape that is non-sticky on both sides to generally enable a user to easily grip the tape strips. In typical use of the present embodiment a user separates mask 200 and paper tape strips 210 from plastic backing 215. Holding paper tape strips 210, the user then places mask 200 over his or her eyes to generally provide light blocking Once mask 200 is in a satisfactory position, paper tape strips 210 are secured to the user's face. Mask 200 may be used alone or in conjunction with baseline strips and/or supplementary strips. It is contemplated that some embodiments may comprise multiple microscopic holes in the light opaque tape layer to allow for small amounts of light to pass through the mask. These embodiments may be beneficial for users who are interested in eliminating artificial light during the night, yet would like to be awoken by sunlight in the morning. Furthermore, some embodiments may using materials or design that are not intended for sensitive skin users or may be irritating to the skin or eyelashes of users with normal skin. For example, without limitation, some of these embodiments may use plastic tape instead of paper tape, may use synthetic fiber instead of gauze, may involve putting tape into direct contact with the eyes, may involve putting electrical tape into direct contact with the skin, etc. All the features disclosed in this specification, including any accompanying abstract and drawings, may be replaced by alternative features serving the same, equivalent or similar purpose, unless expressly stated otherwise. Thus, unless expressly stated otherwise, each feature disclosed is one example only of a generic series of equivalent or similar features. Having fully described at least one embodiment of the present invention, other equivalent or alternative methods of implementing a single use sleep mask according to the present invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Various aspects of the invention have been described above by way of illustration, and the specific embodiments disclosed are not intended to limit the invention to the particular forms disclosed. The particular implementation of the single use sleep mask may vary depending upon the particular context or application. By way of example, and not limitation, the single use sleep masks described in the foregoing were principally directed to sleeping aid implementations; however, similar techniques may instead be applied to eye protection, which implementations of the present invention are contemplated as within the scope of the present invention. For example, without limitation, some embodiments may be used in salons to generally prevent chemicals such as, but not limited to, dye or bleach from splashing into the eyes or in dentist offices to generally prevent water, saliva or foreign particles from entering the eyes during dental procedures. The invention is thus to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the following claims. It is to be further understood that not all of the disclosed embodiments in the foregoing specification will necessarily satisfy or achieve each of the objects, advantages, or improvements described in the foregoing specification.
