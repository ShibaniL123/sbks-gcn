BACKGROUND OF THE SYSTEM This patent application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/978,089 filed on Apr. 10, 2014, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. After a bath towel is used, it is typically hung on a towel rack or holder to dry and be available for further use until it is to be laundered. Prior art towel racks and holders come in a number of configurations, including hooks, rings, pegs, and bars. All prior art towel racks and holders share a common disadvantage, namely that the towel is generally folded over, approximately in half, such that the two sides of the wet towel are either touching or in very close proximity. Towels may be folded over a rack so that that the towel extends its full width on the towel rack. In other instances, the towel may be bunched up through a ring or even folded in fourths to hang over the available space on a bar. Regardless of the hanging technique, the towel does not have sufficient separation from its two sides to permit full drying of the towel between uses. Depending on the environment, the towel may not be fully dry by the next time it is to be used (often after approximately 24 hours). Even if the towel has dried between uses, it is often musty smelling and discourages repeated uses. In that situation, a person may change towels every day, wasting water and negatively affecting the environment. The problem becomes worse with hand towels and dish towels that are used more often than every 24 hours, in some cases multiple times per day. Prior art towel holders where hand towels are used, such as the kitchen, often consist of a drawer handle where the towel stays damp and musty after its first use. In some prior art embodiments, heated towel racks are provided that aid in drying the towel between uses. A disadvantage of heated towel racks is the expense and energy wasted during use. SUMMARY The towel holder of the present system provides a wide bar section that separates the two sides of a towel placed on the holder. This allows greater air flow and space between the two sides of the towel, promoting faster drying, fresher smell, and shorter drying times between uses. The bar section in one embodiment is perforated or mesh so that the air flow to the portion of the towel contacting the rack center bar is increased, improving the drying time and increasing the likelihood that the entire towel will dry at approximately the same rate. The towel holder may be wall mounted, free standing, cantilevered, or any other suitable configuration that allows for separation of the surfaces of a towel when in use. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment of a wall mounted embodiment. FIG. 2 is another view of the embodiment of FIG. 1. FIG. 3 illustrates a free standing embodiment. FIG. 4 illustrates a side view of the system in use. FIGS. 5A-5C illustrate embodiments of the platform. FIG. 6 illustrates an example of a three dimensional mesh embodiment. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM The towel holder of the present system comprises a center bar or platform suspended between two side members that can be attached to a surface, such as a wall or cabinet. In another embodiment, the towel holder can be a floor standing unit with one or more vertical legs supporting a bar or platform over which a towel is draped to provide a holding surface. The center bar or platform is relatively wide, such that there is sufficient space between the inner sides of a towel to allow air to pass more readily and naturally dry the towel that is disposed on the unit. This could be accomplished by various widths in order to allow sufficient air flow to pass between the inner sides of the towel. In addition, the center bar is ideally perforated or comprised of mesh such that air flow to the portion of the towel in contact with the bar is improved. FIG. 1 illustrates an embodiment of the towel rack of the present system. The towel holder comprises a center platform 101 that includes front 103 and back sides 102. The center platform 101 comprises in one embodiment a mesh 104 that allows airflow to the towel when the holder is in use. In this embodiment, the towel holder is wall mounted. In one embodiment, the towel holder is dimensioned such that the distance between back edge 102 of the center platform and an adjoining wall is at least as much as the width of the platform (e.g. the distance between front edge 103 and back 102 edges of the platform). This distance provides at least as much airflow between the wall and the towel as is provided between the halves of the towel when in use. In other embodiments, the back edge 102 can be closer to the wall if desired, due to the fact that the wall itself does not need to dry, so that less airflow may be sufficient to allow the towel to dry. In one embodiment the mesh portion 104 of the towel rack is approximately 2-3 inches wide, allowing better air-flow than prior art systems. In other embodiments the mesh portion may be wider or thinner as desired so that there is sufficient separation between the halves of the towel in use. The length of the towel rack along its longest axis may be of any suitable length so that a towel may be spread over the rack without bunching or overlay. In one embodiment the rack is 18-36 inches in length. In one embodiment, the platform is comprised of metal. However, the platform can be comprised of any suitable rigid material, including plastic, wood, and the like, without departing from the scope and spirit of the system. In addition, instead of the mesh embodiment, the platform may be perforated, slotted, or otherwise provided with openings that allow airflow to the portion of the towel overlaying the platform. In one embodiment, the platform may be solid as well. FIG. 2 illustrates another view of the system. In this embodiment, the rack 101 may be retrofitted to an existing towel rack 105. The view in FIG. 2 is from below where the existing rack 104 is attached to a wall. As a retrofit, there can be any one of several ways of attaching the center platform 101 to an existing, more narrow towel rack. The platform 101 may be affixed to an existing rack 104 using any suitable means of fastening, such as adhesives, screws, straps, zip ties, and the like. As can be seen, the platform existing rack 104 is attached to a wall or other surface by side members 105 and 106. The system of FIG. 2 may be originally built as a unit or it may be a retrofit to an existing towel rack that has its own prior art cross bar such as bar 104. The center platform 101 of the system may be substantially flat or slightly curved as shown in FIG. 2. Although shown as a rectilinear shape in the Figures, the shape of the platform may be any suitable shape, including oval, circular, triangular, and the like as illustrated in FIGS. 5A-5C. In another embodiment, the platform 101 may have a three dimensional surface with peaks and valleys to provide additional airflow to the towel material as shown in FIG. 6. An alternate embodiment of the system is illustrated in FIG. 3. In this embodiment, the towel rack is free standing on the floor, making it useful to use anywhere it is needed without permanently affixing it to a wall or surface. The embodiment of FIG. 3 includes a support member 302 for holding the center platform 301. The support member 302 is coupled to legs 303 that elevate the platform 301 off the floor sufficiently to allow a large towel to be draped over the unit for drying. A free standing embodiment may have a circular drying platform that allows the towel to be draped over the unit, with some gap between the floor and the bottom of the towel to allow airflow for drying. In another embodiment, the drying platform may be rectilinear, triangular, or any other suitable shape to allow support of the towel without sides of the towel touching or being too close for sufficient airflow. FIG. 4 illustrates the system when in use. The towel 401 is draped over the center platform 401 so that left side 402 and right side 403 are separated by an open air space. The section 404 of the towel over the platform is exposed to air via the mesh or perforations of the center platform. Although the embodiments herein illustrate the center platform as an elongated rectangle, it should be understood that the platform may be implemented in any number of shapes, either free-standing or wall mounted. For example, the center platform may be round, square, triangular, curved, flat, concave, convex, or any other suitable shape that supports a towel while providing sufficient space for airflow between sections of the overhanging towel. In addition, although the system is described in connection with a towel, the towel may be a bath towel, hand towel, face towel or the like. The system may also be used for any material that is typically hung for drying, including chamois clothes, wipes, sheets, pillow cases, rags, clothing, and the like. 1.
