ALIPHATIC POLYIMIDES FROM A 1: 1 MOLAR RATIO OF DIAMINE AND UNSATURATED MONOANHYDRIDE OR UNSATURATED DIACID CLAIM OF PRIORITY [0001] This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial Number 61/984,616 bearing Attorney Docket Number 12014004 and filed on April 25, 2014, which is incorporated by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0002] This application concerns the synthesis of aliphatic polyimides, preferably from bio-based ingredients using a 1: 1 molar ratio of unsaturated monoanhydride or unsaturated diacid : diamine. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0003] In recent years there has been an increasing interest in polymers derived from non-petroleum sources. These bio-derived polymers are more sustainable since they are derived from renewable sources and can be made from domestically produced monomers. Unfortunately most bio-derived polymers have been technical constrained in durable applications by having low glass transition temperatures (Tgs) (and hence, low heat distortion temperatures for amorphous polymers), low impact strength, and limited hydrolytic stability. [0004] A key example of a commercially available bio-derived polymer is poly lactic acid, or PLA, that is derived from the fermentation of sugar from corn, but soon to be from tapioca, sugar cane, and eventually cellulose. Sugar is fermented to lactic acid which is converted into lactide (dimer of lactic acid) chemically and further chemically polymerized to polymer. PLA is clear and 100% bio-derived but unfortunately has a low Tg of about 56 °C and is brittle. Attempts have been made to develop higher glass transition polymers via copolymerization with monomers such as furan/isosorbide that yield furan/isosorbide that yield higher Tg polymers. Unfortunately these monomers are currently either in short supply or very expensive. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0005] What is desired is a general class of polymer that fits the at least most of the following criteria: [0006] Tg >65°C, [0007] hydrolytic stability close to PET, [0008] improved flammability over PLA, e.g. Limiting Oxygen Index > 17%, [0009] largely bio-derived content > 90%, preferably 100%, [00010] properties that can be easily tailored by monomer selection, [00011] applicable to a reactive extrusion process, [00012] cost effective, e.g. in both conversion process and raw materials costs. [00013] It was decided to investigate the class of aliphatic polyimides, due to the availability of suitable monomers and properties of polyimides relative to the criteria above. [00014] One aspect of the present invention is an aliphatic polyimide selected from the group consisting of: and combinations thereof, wherein m is greater than about 20, wherein n is greater than about 20, and wherein R is H for maleic anhydride and C¾ for citraconic anhydride, and X = (CH2)Z , wherein x is 1 to 1000, wherein y is 1 to 100, and wherein z = 2 to 12. EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION [00015] Polyimides [00016] Polyimides are an important class of polymers which have been utilized commercially in the areas of aerospace, electronics, photovoltaic s, and membranes. Polyimides as a class of polymers possess several desirable properties, especially high thermal stability, very good electrical properties, low moisture uptake, low flammability characteristics, good hydrolytic stability, and flexibility in modifying properties via monomer selection and amount. [00017] Polyimides are typically prepared commercially from a dianhydride and a diamine in a solution process, but melt processes have been described and are desired. Another route from isocyanurates and dianhydrides to polyimides has also described. [00018] Additionally the ability of the properties of polyimides to be modified dramatically by the proper selection of monomers provides this class of polymers a unique degree of molecular design not seen with most polymers. [00019] Polyimides can be classified into thermosetting or thermoplastic. Typically, the thermosetting type of polyimide is prepared by choosing the appropriate end-capping moiety with sequential crosslinking or curing at that point. However, polyimides with elastomeric blocks and liquid crystal blocks have also been prepared. [00020] Polyimides can be further classified as to whether the starting monomers are all aromatic or aliphatic (cyclic, straight chain, or both) or a combination of both. [00021] Typically for high temperature applications, the wholly aromatic polyimides are chosen, and hybrids can be used for specific applications, e.g., where the aliphatic is a diamino siloxane, an elastomeric polymer can be obtained. However aliphatic polyimides are being reinvestigated for lower temperature optical applications where the non-aromatic characteristics give the polyimide polymer less inherent color and yet retain good dielectric properties. [00022] An area that had not been explored until this invention was an attempt to make high molecular weight polyimides from unsaturated monoanhydrides and preferably from "bio-derived monomers". For purposes of this invention, "bio-derived monomers" means monomers which are, or foreseeably can be made from, biologically active sources, such as bio-mass. Even though some of the experiments might rely upon petrochemical sources, as stated in the text following the experiments, the literature describes means of making the various monomers or their precursors from biologically active sources. Therefore, this invention is not to be limited to only those monomers presently bio-derived but also includes those monomers presently petrochemically derived but become also available from biologically active sources [00023] While this work emphasizes thermoplastic materials, a person having ordinary skills in the art would know how to modify the polyimide endgroups to render the polymer capable of thermosetting. That person would also understand how to incorporate elastomeric segments to yield an elastomeric polyimide. [00024] In this invention, totally aliphatic class of polyimides were explored, because at present there is no readily available source of naturally occurring aromatic amines and/or anhydrides derived from bio-mass. However, several aliphatic anhydrides are available from citric acid, namely itaconic and citraconic anhydrides, obtained by the heating of citric acid which itself can be obtained from citrus waste streams or by fermentation of glucose. As well the corresponding di-acids are available. Additionally butanediol is becoming available from bio-mass, and there are chemical methods to manufacture maleic anhydride from butanediol as well as from succinic acid, which is currently being produced from bio-mass. [00025] Unfortunately there are no dianhydrides readily available from bio-mass. So a method had to be sought that could transform aliphatic mono- anhydrides into aliphatic dianhydrides. Initially it was thought from a study of U.S. Patent 6,495,657 that this transformation was a straightforward task. Unfortunately, this was not the case, but new approaches were developed in order to have the desired difunctionality necessary to make high molecular weight polyimides. [00026] On the amine side, aliphatic amines are usually found in the degradation of amino acids, but the most readily available diamines today are 1,10 diamino decane and 1,9 diamino nonane both derived from castor bean oil, a bio-based or otherwise renewable resource. There are already efforts to make 1, 6 hexane diamine from bio-mass because of its use in making nylon 6,6. And recently a "green synthesis" for the production of amines from alcohols has also been published which may open the way to further diamines of shorter chain length, e.g. 1,4 diamino butane from 1,4 butanediol, 1,3 and 1,2 diaminopropanes from 1,3 propanediol and 1,2 propanediol respectively, and finally ethylene diamine from ethylene glycol. Recently, 1,5 - pentamethylenediamine made from bio-mass or sugar through micro-organism process is commerically available, and it has been used to make bio-based nylons. [00027] Before this work, the only aliphatic polyimides from biological sources that was found in the literature was described in U.S. Patent No. 4,046,748, where an attempt was made of synthesizing a bio-polyimide polymer from a terpene. It describes the preparation of a dianhydride by reacting a terpene and maleic anhydride; unfortunately the major adduct about 85% is a monoanhydride with only about 15% of the product being a dianhydride, which is necessary for making high molecular weight polyimide. Reaction with a difunctional amine yielded a polymer with a number average molecular weight 704 g/mole. This material was not truly polymeric in nature and was only useful as a tackifying resin. No attempts were described to isolate or separate the dianhydride from the reaction mixture for further attempts at polymerization. [00028] Therefore, aliphatic polyimides preferably from bio-derived monomers, as defined above, were explored and found to be capable of polymerization, according to this invention. [00029] Experiments and Results [00030] Experimental Methods [00031] All materials were purchased from Sigma- Aldrich or other suppliers and used as received. [00032] In order to quickly determine whether double bonds were present, the Baeyer test with aqueous permanganate ion was utilized. The purple aqueous permanganate ion color changes to a brownish precipitate if oxidization of C=C double bonds occurs. Appropriate FT-IR was used to determine the presence of functional groups, e.g presence of imide group. Because the polymeric materials obtained were largely insoluble, CHN elemental analysis was used to determine structures by best fit to theoretical structures. Thermal analyses were utilized to determine Tg, and weight loss. Determination of thermoplastic nature was determined by the characterizing the reversible deformability of polymeric films on a hot heating plate. Color was noted visually. [00033] Instrumental Information: [00034] Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to identify the presence of functional groups. The spectra for polyimide films were collected by transmission mold using Nicolet 710, pressed in the diamond anvil optical cell. The spectra for intermediates were collected by transmission mode with the same instrument using liquid film technique on Germanium. [00035] Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was utilized to determine glass transition temperature and thermal stability. The samples were analyzed using a TA Instruments model DSC Q2000. The specimens were exposed to a heat-cool-heat cycle in the analysis. The temperature range of each segment was from -60 °C to 120 °C (or 180 °C or 240 °C) at heating/cooling rates of 10 °C/minute. A helium gas purge of 25 ml/minute was used. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the sample was determined using the half- height from the data recorded in the second heating segment of the analysis. [00036] Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was utilized to determine the thermal stability of bio-derived polyimide films. The samples were analyzed using a TA Instruments model TGA Q2000. The temperature range was from room temperature to 700 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/minute in air with a flow rate of 70 mL/min. [00037] Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was utilized to obtain information on number- average molecular weight, weight- average molecular weight and molecular weight distribution using Waters Corporation modular HPLC/GPC system including Model 2414 Refractive Index Detector (RI), Model 515 HPLC Pump and Model 717plus Autosampler. The samples were processed on Justice Systems Chrom Perfect software. The solvent used was tetrahydrofuran (THF). Standard polystyrenes were used for calibration. [00038] Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was utilized to analyze the structure of intermediate using HP 6890 series GC system and HP 5943 mass-selective detector. The temperature used for this test was 250 °C. [00039] CHN elemental analysis was done at Robertson Microlit Laboratories Inc. in NJ. Silicon content was done in the same lab using a microwave digestion method. [00040] The weathering properties of aliphatic polyimides were studied by dry QUV accelerated weathering test following ASTM D4329. Samples are mounted in the QUV apparatus and subjected to a continuous exposure at 40 °C to intense ultraviolet radiation without moisture exposure or condensation. The testing was done using Q-Panel QUV/se with Solar Eye irradiance controller with UVA-351 lamp. The total testing time is 1000 hours. Samples were taken out for color reading and FT-IR analysis at the beginning of test and every 250 hours. [00041] Use of 1 : 1 molar ratio of anhydride: diamine [tMN)42] Several types of reactions could happen with the presence of anhydride, C=C bonds, and amine group. One is the aza-Michael Addition of amine group to C=C double bonds. If this reaction occurs, a dianhydride can be derived from an unsaturated monoanhydride. One reaction is the typical reaction for polyimide between anhydride and amine groups to form imide functionality. Another one is the reaction between C=C double bonds at high temperature. These reactions could occur preferably at a certain condition when different stoichiometry is used. In this method, 2 moles of amine group could react with lmole of C=C double bonds and 1 mole of anhydride functionality respectively. The maleimide could be able to homopolymerize via the C=C double bonds via aza-Michael addition and form a polyimide. [00043] Use of 1 : 1 molar ratio of diacid: diamine [00044] Several types of reactions could happen with the presence of diacid, C=C bonds, and amine group. One is the aza-Michael Addition of amine group to C=C double bonds. If this reaction occurs, a tetra-acid can be derived from a bio-based diacid. One reaction is the reaction between diacid and amine groups with loss of a water molecule to form imide functionality. Another one is the reaction between C=C double bonds at high temperature. These reactions could occur preferably at a certain condition when different stoichiometry is used. Therefore, the ratio of 1/1, 2/1, 2/1/1 of diacid/diamine/monoamine is used in the above methods. In Method I, 2 moles of amine group could react with lmole of C=C double bonds and 1 mole of diacid functionality respectively. The maleimide could be able to homopolymerize via the C=C double bonds via aza- Michael addition and form a polyimide. [00045] Use of 1: 1 molar ratio of anhydride: diamine [00046] A diamine is added to a monoanhydride with a 1: 1 molar ratio, giving a ring-opened amic acid. Then the intermediate self polymerizes at high temperature, forming a polymeric imide structure. [00047] Below is the reaction scheme for Examples 1-11. [00048] Reaction (i) is the chain growth polymerization via aza- Michael addition to C=C double bonds. Reaction (ii) is the thermal imidization by losing water molecules. Reaction (i) and (ii) both occurred during heating with no preferred sequence. The amic acid monomer (product of monoanhydride with diamine) has to go through both these two reactions to form the final polyimide product. 10 [00049] wherein m is greater than about 20 and preferably greater than about 150, wherein x can be 1 to 1000, desirably about 5 to about 25, and preferably about 8 to about 14, and wherein y can be 1 to 100, desirably about 2 to about 35, and preferably about 2 to about 8. [00050] Table A shows the ingredients used in all Examples of this document, except the sodium phenyl phosphinate which was synthesized as follows: [00051] 14.21 grams of phenylphosphinic acid (0.10 mole) was dissolved in 50 mL of methanol at room temperature in a 250 mL single-neck round bottom flask along with a magnetic stirring bar. Then 4.00 grams of sodium hydroxide (0.10 mole) was added and dissolved. The reaction was observed to be exothermic. The solution was kept stirring at room temperature for one hour. The pH value of the final solution was tested by a piece of pH test paper. The pH value was 7. [00052] Most of the solvent was evaporated by keeping the flask in the hood for three days. Then a white solid precipitated out from the solution. The resulting solution was filtered. The white solid was vacuum dried at 60 °C overnight to remove any residual solvent or moisture. The final material was a white solid of 11.87 grams. [00053] Example 1: polv-3-(4-me^v/-2,5-dioxo-l-pyrrolidine-N- decamethylene amino) [00054] An intermediate was prepared via reaction between a monoanhydride and a diamine with molar ratio of 1: 1. First, 1.1208 g of commercially available citraconic anhydride (0.01 mole) was dissolved in 10 g methanol in a single-neck flask along with a magnetic stirring bar. Then, 1.7231 grams of commercially available 1, 10-diaminodecane (0.01 mole) was dissolved in 15 grams of methanol and then added dropwise into the solution over a one hour period. The flask was kept stirring continuously for another two hours. The solution was clear, but a white precipitate appeared after the solution was sealed and kept in the hood for 5 days at room temperature. Baeyer test result was positive, which confirmed the existence of C=C double bonds at this stage. [00055] The intermediate obtained in the first step was used to prepare polyimide film via thermal imidization. First, methanol in the solution was removed by evaporation at room temperature. Then, the viscous light yellow liquid was heated to 220 °C at a rate increase of 3 °C/min. The final material is an amber-colored, rubbery film. The imidization kinetics was studied by taking samples at different temperatures. All the samples taken at different temperatures in the range of 170 °C to 220 °C were analyzed via the Baeyer test to investigate the reaction mechanism by studying when C=C bonds disappeared. All of the samples in the range of 170 °C to 200 °C showed positive results, confirming the presence of C=C bonds. But the sample taken at 210 °C gave a negative result, indicating the C=C double bond disappeared at this stage. IR spectra suggested the presence of ring-opened acid and some amide at 170 °C, and it suggested less acid and imide structure at higher temperature, e.g. 220 °C. The film was sent for CHN elemental analysis to determine structure. Its thermoplastics behavior was demonstrated while being heated on a hot plate around 220 °C. It can be softened, be bent and twisted during heating. The deformation is maintained if the film is cooled to room temperature, and its original shape can be recovered during a second heating. DSC result gave a Tg of 62 °C.

Baeyer test result was positive, which confirmed the existence of C=C double bonds at this stage. [00058] The intermediate obtained in the first step was used to prepare polyimide film via thermal imidization. First, methanol in the solution was removed by evaporation at room temperature. Then, the viscous light yellow liquid was heated to 220 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. The final material is an amber- colored, rigid film similar to the film obtained in example 1. The imidization kinetics was studied by taking samples at different temperatures. All the samples taken at different temperatures in the range of 170 °C to 220 °C were analyzed via Baeyer test to follow the reaction mechanism by studying when C=C bonds disappeared. All of the samples in the range of 170 °C to 200 °C showed positive results, confirming the presence of C=C bonds. But the sample taken at 210 °C gave a negative result, indicating the C=C double bonds disappeared at this stage. IR spectra suggested the presence of ester, free acid and amide at 170 °C, and it suggested imide structure at higher temperature, e.g. 220 °C. The film was sent for CHN elemental analysis to determine structure. Its thermoplastics behavior was demonstrated while being heated on a hot plate around 220 °C. It can be softened, be bent and twisted during heating. The deformation is maintained if the film is cooled to room temperature, and its original shape can be recovered during a second heating. No DSC was done on this sample.

Then, 2.3012 grams of commercially available Jeffamine D-230 Polyetheramine from Huntsman (MW=230, 0.01 mole) was dissolved in 20 grams of methanol and then added dropwise into the solution over a one hour period. The flask was kept stirring continuously for another two hours. The solution was in very light yellow color. The reaction was noticed as exothermic. The intermediate obtained in the first step was used to prepare polyimide film via thermal imidization. First, methanol in the solution was removed by evaporation at room temperature. Then, the viscous light yellow liquid was kept at 60 °C under vacuum for 2 hours, and heated to 220 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. The final material is an amber-colored soft film, which indicated a low Tg. The film was sent for CHN elemental analysis to determine structure. DSC result showed a Tg transition of 36 °C. [00080] Example 11: poly-3-(4-me^y/-2,5-dioxo-l-pyrrolidine-N- dodecamethylene amino) [00081] An intermediate was prepared via reaction between a mono anhydride and a diamine with molar ratio of 1: 1. First, 1.1208 g of commercially available citraconic anhydride (0.01 mole) was dissolved in 10 g methanol in a single-neck flask along with a magnetic stirring bar. Then, 2.0036 grams of commercially available 1,12-diaminododecane (0.01 mole) was dissolved in 20 grams of methanol and then added dropwise into the solution over a one hour period. The flask was kept stirring continuously for another two hours. The reaction was noticed as exothermic. White precipitates appeared. Baeyer test result was positive, which confirmed the existence of C=C double bonds at this stage. The intermediate obtained in the first step was used to prepare polyimide film via thermal imidization. First, methanol in the solution was removed by evaporation at room temperature. Then, the viscous light yellow liquid was kept at 60 °C under vacuum for 2 hours, and heated to 220 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. The final material is an amber-colored flexible film. The film was sent for CHN elemental analysis to determine structure. DSC result gave a Tg of 41 °C. [00082] Below is the reaction scheme for Example 12.  [00083] wherein n is greater than about 20 and preferably greater than about 150, wherein x can be 1 to 1000, desirably about 5 to about 25, and preferably about 8 to about 14, and wherein y can be 1 to 100, desirably about 2 to about 35, and preferably about 2 to about 8. [00084] Example 12: poly-(3-me^v/e?¾e-2,5-dioxo-l-pyrrolidine-N- ethylene amino) [00085] An intermediate was prepared via reaction between a monoanhydride and a diamine with molar ratio of 1: 1. First, 1.1208 g of commercially available itaconic anhydride (0.01 mole), the isomer of citraconic anhydride, was dissolved in 10 g methanol in a single-neck flask along with a magnetic stirring bar. Then, 0.6010 grams of commercially available ethylene diamine (0.01 mole) was dissolved in 20 grams of methanol and then added dropwise into the solution over a one hour period. The flask was kept stirring continuously for another two hours. The reaction was noticed as exothermic. A white precipitate appeared a few minutes after ethylenediamine was added into the solution, then the solution became milky. Baeyer test result was positive, which confirmed the existence of C=C double bonds at this stage. The intermediate obtained in the first step was used to prepare polyimide film via thermal imidization. First, methanol in the solution was removed by evaporation at room temperature. Then, the viscous light yellow liquid was kept at 60 °C under vacuum for 2 hours, and heated to 220 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. The final material is an amber-colored rigid film. The film was sent for CHN elemental analysis to determine structure. DSC result gave a Tg of 160 °C. [00086] Summary of Anhydride Method : [00087] The glass transition temperature of examples using this anhydride method and the theoretical CHN contents are listed in Table 1. The theoretical CHN contents were calculated based on the structure proposed previously, which is listed below. The actual CHN elemental contents were tested by Robertson Microlit Lab Inc. The difference between theoretical CHN contents and the average CHN contents found from actual CHN elemental analysis were mostly less than 1 wt%, as shown in Table 1, suggesting the real structure matched the proposed structure in most of the cases. The glass transition temperature increased when a diamine of shorter chain length is used. This gives one the ability to tailor Tg by proper monomer selection. [00088] The following is the proposed structure for the method using anhydride: wherein m is greater than about 20 and preferably greater than about 150, wherein n is greater than about 20 and preferably greater than about 150, wherein X = (CH2)Z, wherein x can be 1 to 1000, desirably about 5 to about 25, and preferably about 8 to about 14, and wherein y can be 1 to 100, desirably about 2 to about 35, and preferably about 2 to about 8, and wherein z is 2 to 12. [00089] The IUPAC name for the embodiments of formula AP-I when X = (CH2)z is poly-3-(4-alkyl-2,5-dioxo-l-pyrrolidine-N-alkylene amino). For example, if R=CH3 and X=C2H4, then formula AP-1 is poly-3-(4-methyl-2,5- dioxo-1 -pyrrolidine-lSi '-ethylene amino ). [00090] The IUPAC name for the embodiments of formula AP-II when X = (CH2)z is poly-3-(3-alkylene-2,5-dioxo-l-pyrrolidine-N-alkylene amino). For example, if R=CH3 and X=C2H4 , then formula AP-2 is poly-3-(4- methylene-2,5-dioxo-l -pyrrolidine -M '-ethylene amino ). Table 1. Tg and CHN contents of examples using the Anhydride Method Additional examples (continued table 1) [00091] In example 9, the silicon (Si) content is analyzed by elemental analysis as well. The silicon content was determined to be 28.91 %, while the theoretical silicon content is in the range of 30.74 to 31.09 %. [00092] The glass transition temperature showed a decrease trend with increase of C number in the diamine used. A shorter diamine chain is used, implying less flexibility and therefore a high Tg transition is expected. The odd- even effect is observed as the glass transition of odd-numbered C atom diamine (e.g. C9 diamine based material) is lower than even-numbered C atom diamine (e.g. CIO diamine based material). [00093] The Tg ranged from -30 °C to 160 °C. [00094] The Diacid Method: Use of 1: 1 molar ratio of diacid: diamine [00095] A diamine is added to a diacid with a 1 : 1 molar ratio, giving a ring-opened amic acid. Then the intermediate self polymerizes at high temperature, forming a polymeric imide structure. However in the case of Example 13 it is suspected that a low molecular weight polyamide is formed with a portion being soluble in THF and in methanol, along with some possible oxidized polyimide, which is difficult to characterize. [00096] Here is the proposed reaction scheme of itaconic acid, Example 13. wherein p in this Example 13 is 2 to 3 which is soluble in methanol or THF; wherein x can be 1 to 1000, desirably about 5 to about 25, and preferably about 8 to about 14, and wherein y can be 1 to 100, desirably about 2 to about 35, and preferably about 2 to about 8. However, p could be possibly greater than 20 if prepared in inert conditions. [00097] Reaction occurs between the unsaturated diacid and diamine and amide functionality forms instead of amic acid due to the rotation of the main chain. However, it is presumed that isomerization and oxidation happens during heating resulting in higher than expected O (oxygen) % content for Example 13. [00098] Example 13: A Comparative Example [00099] An intermediate was prepared via reaction between a di-acid and a diamine with molar ratio of 1: 1. First, 0.6505 g of commercially available itaconic acid (0.005 mole) was dissolved in 10 g methanol in a single-neck flask along with a magnetic stirring bar. Then, 0.8615 grams of commercially available 1,10-diaminodecane (0.005 mole) was dissolved in 20 grams of methanol and then added dropwise into the solution over a one hour period. The flask was kept stirring continuously for another two hours. The reaction was noticed as exothermic. The solution was initially clear, then a white precipitate appeared around half an hour after 1,10-diaminodecane was added. The intermediate obtained in the first step was used to prepare polyimide film via thermal imidization. First, methanol in the solution was removed by evaporation at room temperature. Then, the viscous light yellow liquid was kept at 60 °C under vacuum for 2 hours, and heated to 220 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min.. The final material is an amber-colored soft film, which could be partially dissolved in THF and methanol. The dissolved part was analyzed via GPC in THF. The numbered average molecular weight was only Mn=685, and the weighted average molecular weight was Mw=921. The structure was confirmed to have amide functionality via FT-IR spectrum (1556 cm l). The material was sent for CHN elemental analysis to determine structure. However, the results of CHN elemental analysis did not match the amide structure. The elemental results showed a higher oxygen content, suggesting isomerization and oxidation during reaction. This Example 13 cannot be considered a polyimide of the invention. [000100] Next is the reaction scheme of citraconic acid, Example 14. wherein q is greater than about 60 and preferably greater than about 1200, wherein x can be 1 to 1000, desirably about 5 to about 25, and preferably about 8 to about 14, and wherein y can be 1 to 100, desirably about 2 to about 35, and preferably about 2 to about 8. [000101] Here, reaction (i) is the chain growth polymerization via aza- Michael addition to C=C double bonds. Reaction (ii) is the thermal imidization by losing water molecules. Reaction (i) and (ii) both occurred during heating with no preferred sequence. The amic acid monomer (product of diacid with diamine) has to go through both these two reactions to form the final polyimide product. [000102] Example 14: poly-3-(4-methyl-2,5-dioxo-l-pyrrolidine-N- decamethylene amino) [000103] An intermediate was prepared via reaction between a di-acid and a diamine with molar ratio of 1: 1. First, 0.6505 g of commercially available citraconic acid (0.005 mole), the isomer of itaconic acid, was dissolved in 10 g methanol in a single-neck flask along with a magnetic stirring bar. Then, 0.8615 grams of commercially available 1,10-diaminodecane (0.005 mole) was dissolved in 20 grams of methanol and then added dropwise into the solution over a one hour period. The flask was kept stirring continuously for another two hours. The reaction was noticed as exothermic. The solution was initially clear, and then a white precipitate appeared after 24 hours. The intermediate obtained in the first step was used to prepare polyimide film via thermal imidization. First, methanol in the solution was removed by evaporation at room temperature. Then, the viscous light yellow liquid was kept at 60 °C under vacuum for 2 hours, and heated to 220 °C at a rate of 3 °C/min. The final material is an amber-colored flexible film. The structure was confirmed to have mainly imide functionality (peak at 1702 cm l) via FT-IR spectrum along with minor amide (peak at 1542 cm-1) and aziridinium imide (peak at 1775 cm_1) functionalities. The material was sent for CHN elemental analysis to determine structure. The results of CHN elemental analysis matched the predicted imide structure. DSC gave a Tg transition of 70 °C. [000104] Summary of Diacid Method: [000105] These two examples are used to demonstrate that unsaturated diacid could be utilized for synthesis of polyimide but that citraconic acid is preferred at this time since the Tg was estimated from its film properties to be about room temperature. The glass transition temperature of examples using this Diacid Method and the theoretical CHN contents are listed in Table 2. The theoretical CHN contents were calculated based on the structure proposed previously, which is listed below. The actual CHN elemental contents were tested by Robertson Microlit Lab Inc. The difference between theoretical CHN contents and the average CHN contents found from actual CHN elemental analysis are mostly less than lwt for Example 14, as shown in Table 2, suggesting the real structure matched the proposed structure in most of the cases. The CHN elemental analysis of Example 13 suggested isomerization and oxidation during reaction. [000106] The following is the proposed structure for the diacid method , wherein p is greater than about 2-3, wherein q is greater than about 20 and preferably greater than about 150, and wherein X is as identified in Reaction Schemes for Examples 13 and 14. However, p could be possibly greater than 20 if prepared in inert conditions. [000107] The IUPAC name is not provided for formula AP-III because the polymer of formula AP-III is not a polyimide, and it is not part of the claimed invention. However, its presence in this patent application is intended to show how minor variations can unexpectedly result in different polymer structures. [000108] The IUPAC name for formula AP-IV is poly-3-(4-alkyl-2,5- dioxo-1 -pyrrolidine-N-alkylene amino). It is noted that formula AP-I and formula AP-IV are the same, even though these products are synthesized from different starting materials and utilize different reaction methods. Thus, for purposes of claiming, references to q as the polymer unit for AP-IV will be to m as the polymer unit for AP-I. The variables in AP-IV for X, x, y, and z are the same as for formula AP- 1. Table 2. Tg and CHN contents of examples using Diacid Method [000109] Demonstration of melt reaction on hot plate [000110] Example 15: polv-3-(4-methyl-2,5-dioxo-l-pyrrolidine-N- hexamethylene amino) [000111] The melt reaction between a di-acid and a diamine with molar ratio of 1: 1 was demonstrated on a hot plate.

Then 0.5812 grams of commercially available hexamethylenediamine (0.005 mole) was added into the melt at ambient conditions and stirred vigorously by a stirring rod. The reaction was found to be exothermic. The exothermic effect was evaluated by monitoring the temperature fluctuation using an infrared thermometer. The melt of citraconic acid had a temperature of 75 °C. The temperature spiked up to 125 °C in 3 seconds after hexamethylenediamine was added. The temperature slowly dropped to 110 °C and then to 100 °C after 30 seconds. After the temperature dropped to 90 °C, the mixture was heated on the hot plate at 220 °C. The melt reaction and imidization took about 4 minutes. The final material was a colorless solid under heat and it turned into a pink glassy solid during cooling. The thermal properties were measured by DSC. An endothermic peak was seen at the first heating scan, suggesting residual unreacted materials. The glass transition temperature was 106 °C [000112] Example 16: polv-3-(4-methyl-2,5-dioxo-l-pyrrolidine-N- hexamethylene amino) with stabilizer. [000113] The melt reaction between a di-acid and a diamine with molar ratio of 1 : 1 was demonstrated on a hot plate with the presence of a stabilizer in order to get low colored materials. First, 0.6503 g of commercially available citraconic acid (0.005 mole) was melted in an aluminum weighing dish on a hot plate. Then 0.5815 grams of commercially available hexamethylenediamine (0.005 mole) and 0.0405 g commercially available Irganox® MD 1024 (Ciba Inc.) were added into the melt at ambient conditions and stirred vigorously by a stirring rod. The reaction was exothermic. The mixture was heated on the hot plate at 220 °C for about 4 minutes. The final material was a yellow colored solid under heat and it turned into a red solid during cooling. The yellow color was seen again if the material was heated on the hot plate. The thermal properties were measured by DSC. An endothermic peak was seen at the first heating scan, suggesting residual unreacted materials. The glass transition temperature was 55 °C. The structure was confirmed to have mainly imide functionality (peak at 1699 cm l) via FT-IR spectrum along with minor amide (peak at 1543 cm-1) and aziridinium imide (peak at 1773 cm_1) functionalities. [000114] Example 17: polv-3-(4-methyl-2,5-dioxo-l-pyrrolidine-N- hexamethylene amino) with stabilizer [000115] The melt reaction between a di-acid and a diamine with molar ratio of 1 : 1 was demonstrated on a hot plate with the presence of a stabilizer in order to get low colored materials. First, 0.6510 g of commercially available citraconic acid (0.005 mole) was melted in an aluminum weighing dish on a hot plate.Then 0.5815 grams of commercially available hexamethylenediamine (0.005 mole) and 0.0411 g commercially available Irgafos® P-EPQ (Ciba Inc.) were added into the melt at ambient conditions and stirred vigorously by a stirring rod. The reaction was exothermic. The mixture was heated on the hot plate at 220 °C for about 4 minutes. The final material was a yellow colored solid under heat and it turned into red solid during cooling. The yellow color was seen again if the material was heated on the hot plate. The thermal properties were measured by DSC. An endothermic peak was seen at the first heating scan, suggesting residual unreacted materials. The glass transition temperature was 64 °C. The structure was confirmed to have mainly imide functionality (peak at 1698 cm"1) via FT-IR spectrum along with minor amide (peak at 1545 cm-1) and aziridinium imide (peak at 1774 cm"1) functionalities.

Then 0.5810 grams of commercially available hexamethylenediamine (0.005 mole) was added into the melt at ambient conditions and stirred vigorously by a stirring rod. The reaction was exothermic. The mixture was heated on the hot plate at 150 °C for about 3 minutes. Then the material was heated in a vacuum oven to 220 °C at a heating rate of 3 °C/min. The material was cooled to room temperature under vacuum to minimize any possible oxidization during cooling. The final material was a light yellow colored solid. The glass transition temperature was 95 °C. The structure was confirmed to have mainly imide functionality (peak at 1698 cm"1) via FT-IR spectrum along with minor amide (peak at 1545 cm-1) and aziridinium imide (peak at 1774 cm"1) functionalities.

The reaction was exothermic. The mixture was heated on the hot plate at 220 °C. The material turned into a colorless solid after about 3 minutes and it turned into light pink during cooling. The color was lighter than that of example 16. The glass transition temperature was 46 °C. The structure was confirmed to have mainly imide functionality (peak at 1697 cm"1) via FT-IR spectrum along with minor amide (peak at 1536 cm-1) and aziridinium imide (peak at 1774 cm"1) functionalities. [000120] Example 20: polv-3-(4-methyl-2,5-dioxo-l-pyrrolidine-N- decamethylene amino) with catalyst [000121] The melt reaction between an anhydride and a diamine with molar ratio of 1 : 1 was demonstrated on a hot plate with the presence of a catalyst in order to promote the melt reaction. First, 0.5606 g of commercially available citraconic anhydride (0.005 mole) was melted in an aluminum weighing dish on a hot plate.

[000124] Summary on demonstration of melt reaction on hot plate [000125] It has been demonstrated on hot plate that aliphatic polyimide could be made via melt reaction in a reasonable time frame. Generally, the aliphatic polyimide made from melt reaction had an amber color. However, the color could be reduced by using stabilizers or cooling the imidized films under vacuum to reduce any possible oxidization. Among three stabilizers that were used, Irgafos® P-EPQ, Irganox® MD 1024 and Irganox® MD 1010, Irganox® MD 1010 was found to be most effective in reducing colors. Irganox® MD 1024 has amide functionality itself which could lower the imide content in the final product. The method of cooling imidized films under vacuum required more time but it could low the color with no effect on structures. It is also possible to promote the melt reaction by using selected imidization catalysts, such as sodium phenyl phosphinate. In this case, reaction times were reduced from 4 minutes at about 220 °C to about 2 minutes using about 2% loadings. This kinetics study has shown the reaction occurs in less than two minutes. ANALYSIS OF METHODS OF SYNTHESIS [000126] Effect of monomers, solvents, process methods, stabilizers and catalysts on the thermal properties of aliphatic polyimides [000127] Number of C atoms in diamine [000128] The glass transition temperature (Tg) of the aliphatic polyimides fell in a range of a little above room temperature up to 158°C when diamines with different C atoms were used. The trend found was that when a shorter diamine chain was used, there was less flexibility and therefore a higher Tg was obtained. [000129] When a diamine with long chain length is used, e.g. Jeffamine®, or polysiloxane, Tg could be even lower than -30 °C (Examples 9 and 10). [000130] Odd-even effect [000131] The odd-even effect is observed from the Tables above, meaning that Tg of an Example using an odd-numbered diamine is usually lower than a sample using an even-numbered diamine. [000132] Type of anhydrides [000133] Selection of the anhydride could affect the glass transition. Itaconic anhydride tended to give a lower Tg compared to citraconic anhydride. [000134] Anhydride vs. diacid [000135] Citraconic acid and citraconic anhydride performed closely. It appeared that citraconic acid gave a slightly higher Tg than the anhydride. However, citraconic acid is a solid and citraconic anhydride is a liquid, meaning citraconic acid would be preferred due to easy handling. Itaconic acid could not form a high proportion of high MW polyimide. It is probably due to the oxidation of C=C bonds during reaction. [000136] Type of solvents [000137] Several solvents were used to prepare aliphatic polyimides, e.g. methanol, isopropanol, and tetrahydrofuran (THF). Based on the comparative experiments, when the same monomers and conditions were used, methanol always gave a higher Tg than isopropanol or THF. Isopropanol and THF performed closely in terms of change of Tg. An interesting observation is found that THF does not show a good repeatability. In some duplicate experiments, THF could not give a high MW aliphatic polyimide probably due to the existing inhibitor during manufacturing. [000138] Solution process vs. melt process [000139] Solution processing has two steps: formation of polyamic acid in solution and thermal imidization. Solution processing is good for better mixing and dissipation of heat for the first step. Thermal imidization happens later as a separated step. In contrast, these two types of reactions occurred successively on hot plate in several minutes. Melt processing on hot plate has mixing and dissipation of heat issues. The incomplete reaction is another issue for hot plate reaction. It is possible that these issues could be resolved if the reaction were to be done by a more complete reactive process. [000140] Effect of stabilizers [000141] Stabilizers could effectively reduce the color of the aliphatic polyimides, and also lower the amide content. Three types of stabilizers were used in this invention, Irganox® MD 1024, Irgafox® P-EPQ, and Irganox® 1010. By comparison of aliphatic polyimide films prepared with and without stabilizers, use of stabilizers gave lower Tg, which possibly comes from the incomplete reaction on hot plate. [000142] Vacuum vs. stabilizers [000143] Use of vacuum during cooling after imidization could effectively reduce the color of aliphatic polyimides and lower the amide content in the structure. The color of aliphatic polyimide film made by using vacuum during cooling is a very light yellow color, which probably is the intrinsic color of aliphatic polyimide itself. Any oxidization and formation of isoimide during the preparation could make the final color darker. The Tg of aliphatic polyimide film made by using vacuum during cooling is higher than those made using stabilizers for all three stabilizers used. It is possibly due to the long cooling time (about 1.5 hours) after heating. [000144] Effect of catalyst [000145] It has been demonstrated that the melt reaction could be promoted by using selected imidization catalysts, such as sodium phenyl phosphinate. In Examples 20 and 21, the reaction time has been reduced from 4 minutes at 220 °C to about 2 minutes using about 2% loadings. This kinetics study has shown the reaction occurs in less than two minutes. The color goes from yellow to amber. [000146] QUV Accelerated Weathering Test [000147] Overall, no significant changes in structure were seen via FT-IR spectra except the appearance of moisture peaks. A darker color was observed for each sample after exposure to UVA light after 250 hours and no further changes thereafter. Minor changes in flexibility of the films were noticed based on visual observation. [000148] Glass Transition Temperatures [000149] The glass transition temperatures of the polyimides of the invention by this method can range from about -100 °C to about 225 °C and what was observed was from less than about -30 °C (equipment limitation) to about 160 °C. However the sample after hydrolytic aging showed an increase to 224°C presumably due to further reaction; this Tg can be achievable upon initial preparation with process optimization. USES OF ALIPHATIC POLYIMIDES [000150] Compounds and Uses of Compounds [000151] Any of the aliphatic polyimides described about can be melt- mixed with one or more conventional plastics additives in an amount that is sufficient to obtain a desired processing or performance property for the aliphatic polyimide compound. The amount should not be wasteful of the additive or detrimental to the processing or performance of the compound.

APPENDIX [000169] To further explain the value of the present invention, the following text helps support the identification and definition of "bio-derived monomers" for the synthesis of aliphatic polyimides, as this area of chemistry of bio-based sources or renewable resources develops monomers and other chemicals from biologically active sources. [000170] Synthesis Methods for Starting Materials from Natural Sources [000171] 1. Citric Acid [000172] Bio-Synthesis of Citric Acid and Purification [000173] Citric acid is a commercially important product that has been obtained by submerged fermentation of glucose or sucrose by Aspergillus niger. In order for citric acid to be a useful starting material for the production of bio- derived polymers, it should be readily produced from impure starting materials such as starch hydrolyzates, invert sugars, aqueous vegetable extracts containing sugar and partially refaine sucrose sources. It has been found that traces of iron in levels as low as 0.2 ppm is sufficient to promote the generation of large amounts of non- acid-producing cells of the Aspergillus niger, with the result that little or no citric acid is produced. However, as referenced in U. S. Patent 2,970,084 (1961) by Leornard Schweiger discovered that low levels of ionic copper counteracts the effect of iron impurities in the starting sugar source. Following the teachings of this patent, high yields of citric acid can be obtained by the following procedure: [000174] An aqueous medium was prepared having the following composition where in raw (not deionized) corn sugar was used as the carbohydrate source and dissolved in 4000 ml distilled water. To this was added the following nutrients: [000175] (NH)2C03, 0.2%; KH2P04, 0.014%; MgS04.7H20, 0.100%; ZnS04, 0.001%; Corn sugar (as dextrose), 12.3%; Cu(N03)2.3H20, 0.015%. The pH was adjusted to 2.55 with aqueous HC1, and the substrate sterilized in an autoclave at 125C for 30 minutes, cooled, and transferred aspectically to about 6000 ml Pyrex® glass column fermentors, then inoculated with spores of Aspergillus niger. Fermentations were allowed to proceed at room temperature under aseptic conditions for 12 days. [000176] The resulting broth contains about 20% citric acid and is generally purified following the teachings of Purification was done following the "lime/sulfuric acid process" as described in U.S. Patent 5,426,220 (1995), A. Baniel, A. Eval. Generally the content of citric acid resulting from the above recipe is about 20% citric acid, and this mixture is filtered to remove mycellium and then treated with 680 gram of Ca(OH)2 to precipitate calcium citrate. The latter is filtered, washed and reacted with 920 gram of 98% sulfuric acid to form gypsum and a solution of citric acid. The citric acid solution obtained on gypsum filtration is fed to a crystallizer or alternatively evaporated and stripped of mother liquor via vacuum filtration to yield 1050 gram of crystalline citric acid monohydrate and approximately 320 gram of 60% citric acid mother liquor which can be combined and recrystallized. [000177] Synthesis of Citraconic Anhydride via Intermediate Itaconic Acid (Ref.: Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 2, p.368 (1943); Vol. 11, p.70 (1931), Note 8. [000178] 2. Itaconic Anhydride [000179] Itaconic Anhydride from Citric Acid monohydrate [000180] Nine 120-g. portions of citric acid are distilled rapidly (four to six minutes), using 300-cc. Kjeldahl flasks, and all the distillates are collected in the same receiver. The distillate, which generally does not consist of two layers, is placed in an evaporating dish, 50 cc. of water is added, and the mixture is allowed to stand on a steam bath for three hours. On cooling it sets to a semisolid mass of itaconic acid: this is filtered and washed with 150 cc. of water. The residue consists of 138 g. of perfectly white crystals melting at 165°. By concentrating the filtrate an additional 42 g. of product melting at 157-165° is obtained. The total yield is 26-27 per cent of the theoretical amount, and is a convenient laboratory method since it is rapid. [000181] 3. Citraconic Anhydride [000182] Citraconic Anhydride from Itaconic Anhydride (Ref.: Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 2, p.140 (1943); Vol. 11, p.28 (1931). [000183] Two hundred and ninety grams (equivalent to 250 grams itaconic anhydride, either can be used) is distilled rapidly at atmospheric pressure in a 500-cc. modified Claisen flask with a 15-cm. (6-in.) fractionating column; it should be noted that the success of the preparation depends upon a rapid distillation and changing the receivers without interrupting the distillation. The best yields are obtained when the heating period is of short duration. The distillate passing over below 200° consists of water and other decomposition products. The fraction which distils at 200-215° consists of citraconic anhydride and is collected separately. The yield is 170-180 g. (68-72 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product melting at 5.5-6°. On redistillation under reduced pressure there is obtained 155-165 g. (62-66 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which boils at 105-110722 mm. and melts at 7-8°C. [000184] 4. 1,10-Diaminodecane [000185] Bio-synthesis and purification of 1 JO-diamino decane [000186] Sebacic acid can be obtained from castor oil. Sebaconitrile can be obtained by ammonolysis of sebacic acid. Diaminodecane can be obtained by the addition of H2 to sebaconitrile with the presence of catalyst. [000187] Step one: castor oil to sebacic acid [000188] Sebacic acid can be obtained from castor oil by alkali fusion. The alkali fusion of castor oil at 523-548 K in the presence of excess alkali and catalyst produces sebacic acid, 2-octanol (capryl alcohol), and hydrogen. The oleochemicals (sebacic acid and 2-octanol) are precursors for industrially important plasticizers, surface coatings, and perfumery chemicals. 2-Octanol is used in plasticizers in the form of dicapryl esters of various dibasic acids. [000189] Reaction was carried out at a temperature of 458-463 K for a long period (such as 13 h) using 1 mol of sodium or potassium hydroxide. 2- Octanone (methyl hexyl ketone) and 10-hydroxydecanoic acid were obtained as a reaction product. Using 2 mol of alkali per 1 mol of ricinoleate at 513-549 K and with a shorter reaction cycle produces 2-octanol and sebacic acid. Hydrogen was also formed with excess alkali. [000190] The reaction flow chart is found in Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2008, 47, 1774-1778 [000191] Step two: sebacic acid to sebaconitrile [000192] A three-necked flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a thermometer which dips into the liquid, is heated in an oil bath to 160°. In the flask are placed 505 g. (2.5 moles) of commercial sebacic acid and 180 g. (3 moles) of urea, and the melt is heated with stirring for 4 hours at about 160°. The oil bath is removed, the surplus oil is wiped off, the flask is insulated, and the temperature is then raised, as rapidly as foaming permits, to 220° by means of a triple burner and wire gauze. It is important to continue the stirring for at least 5 minutes after 220° is attained; otherwise the mass will foam over during the subsequent distillation. [000193] The stirrer is then replaced by a short still head connected to a long (90-cm.) air condenser and receiver, and the product is distilled at atmospheric pressure as long as any distillate is obtained. The temperature of the vapor rises gradually to 340°. The distillate, which consists chiefly of water, dinitrile, acid nitrile, and sebacic acid, is poured into a large separatory funnel and, after the addition of 500 ml. of ether, is extracted three times with 650-ml. portions of 5% ammonium carbonate. The crude dinitrile which remains after the removal of the ether is distilled under reduced pressure; after a small fore-run (20-25 ml.) the main product is collected at 185-188712 mm. The yield of sebaconitrile is 190-200 g. (46-49%). [000194] The reaction scheme is found in Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 3, p.768 (1955); Vol. 25, p.95 (1945). [000195] Step three: sebaconitrile to 1 JO-Decanediamine [000196] A high-pressure bomb of about 1.1-1. capacity is charged with 82 g. (0.50 mole) of sebaconitrile and about 6 g. of Raney nickel catalyst suspended in 25 ml. of 95% ethanol, an additional 25 ml. of ethanol being used to rinse in the catalyst. The bomb is closed, and about 68 g. (4 moles) of liquid ammonia is introduced from a tared 5-lb. commercial cylinder. Hydrogen is then admitted at tank pressure (1500 lb.), and the temperature is raised to 125°. The reaction starts at about 90° and proceeds rapidly at 110-125°. When hydrogen is no longer absorbed (1-2 hours) the heater is shut off and the bomb allowed to cool. The hydrogen and ammonia are allowed to escape, and the contents of the bomb are rinsed out with two 100-ml. portions of 95% ethanol. The ethanolic solution is filtered quickly through a layer of decolorizing carbon to remove the catalyst and transferred to a 500-ml. Claisen flask having a modified side arm and connected by ground-glass joints to a receiver. The ethanol is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure, the receiver is changed, and the decamethylene-diamine is distilled under reduced pressure. It boils at 143-146°/14 mm and solidifies, on cooling, to a white solid, freezing point 60°. The yield is 68-69 g. (79-80%). [000197] The reaction scheme is identified in Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 3, p.229 (1955); Vol. 27, p.18 (1947). [000198] 5. Tetradecylamine [000199] Bio-synthesis and purification of tetradecylamine [000200] Myristic acid can be obtained from coconut oil via hydrolysis and fractionation. Tetradecylamine can be obtained by reaction of myristic acid with ammonia to get its nitrile, and then followed by hydration to give tetradecylamine. [000201] Step one: coconut oil to trimyristin [000202] In the container A is placed 1500 g. of crushed nutmegs moistened with ether. A is an inverted aspirator bottle connected by a 3-mm. glass tube to the efficient condenser C, and by 3-mm. tubing, one end of which is provided with a Soxhlet thimble to the round-bottomed flask B. Flask B is connected by 3-mm. tubing of 75-cm. length to C. In B are placed 500 cc. of ether and a few chips of clay plate to prevent superheating. B is then heated on a steam cone so that the ether boils rapidly enough to reach the condenser C and to flow back through A. [000203] The extraction with ether is continued until the ether leaving the insoluble solid is entirely colorless. This requires twenty-four to seventy- two hours, according to the state of subdivision of the nutmegs and the rate at which the ether is passed through. The ethereal solution is then freed of a small quantity of entrained insoluble matter by filtering through a folded paper. The clear solution is now entirely freed from ether by distillation on the water bath. The residue weighs 640-690 g. On cooling it sets to a mass of crystals of trimyristin which is filtered with suction and washed with 225 cc. of cold 95 per cent ethyl alcohol in small portions. The product is now recrystallized from 3.5 1. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol; it is stirred mechanically during cooling since the trimyristin tends to separate as an oil at the outset. The crystallized trimyristin is then filtered off by suction and washed with 350-400 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol in small portions. The crystals, which are colorless and practically odorless, melt at 54-55°. The yield is 330-364 g. Further information is found in Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 1, p.538 (1941); Vol. 6, p.100 (1926). [000204] Step two: trimyristin to myristic acid [000205] In a round-bottomed flask are placed 100 g. (0.14 mole) of pure trimyristin www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/orgsyn/prepContent.asp?prep=cvlp0379 - Notel69Nl www. orgsyn.org/orgsyn/prep. asp ?prep=CVlP0538 and 200 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture is heated on a steam bath for two hours, with frequent shaking or stirring until the trimyristin has become emulsified. It is then diluted with 300 cc. of water and the heating is continued for another one-half hour, by which time the solution should be almost clear, indicating complete saponification. The solution is now poured with stirring into a hot solution of 650 cc. of water and 100 cc. of 20 per cent hydrochloric acid. The free acid which separates is not entirely clear, owing to the presence of unchanged sodium salt. A gentle current of steam is passed into the hot mixture until the oily layer is transparent; this requires about fifteen minutes. The acid is allowed to cool and solidify; it is removed and freed of small quantities of salt and water by filtering through paper in a steam-jacketed funnel. The yield is 84-90 g. (89-95 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a colorless product which melts at 52-53° http://www.orgsyn.org/orgsyn/orgsyn/prepContent.asp?prep=cvlp0379 - Notel69N3 . [000206] Further information is found in Organic Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 1, p.379 (1941); Vol. 6, p.66 (1926). [000207] Step three: myristic acid to tetradecylamine [000208] Commercially, the synthesis of these quaternary ammonium salts involves the reaction of fatty acids with ammonia, in a combined liquid-phase- vapor-phase process, to form the corresponding fatty nitriles (I). These long- chain alkylnitriles (LANs) are converted by hydrogenation to primary or secondary amines, depending on the reaction conditions. Reductive alkylation of these amines with formaldehyde affords the trialkylamines (TAMS) (II), which are quatemized by exhaustive alkylation with methyl chloride to the final di- or trimethylalkylammonium salts (III). [000209] Extensive purification of these products is not required to achieve the activity of the final product, so that most commercial cationic surfactants are associated with a mixture of their starting materials and reaction interme-diates. In this respect, we found in dimethylditallowammonium chloride (DMDTAC), the most common cationic surfactant used in laundry detergents, concentrations of 300-320 μg/g of C14-C18 LANs (I) and of 450-500 μg/g of TAMS (II). [000210] Further information can be found in "Occurrence of Cationic Surfactants and Related Products in Urban Coastal Environments", P. Fernandez, M. Vails, J. M. Bayona, and J. Albalges Environ. Sci. Technol. 1991, 25, 547-550 [000211] 6. Comments about bio-sourced maleic anhydride, n-butylamine [000212] Although all monomers utilized presently cannot be determined to be all bio-derived, they indeed can be obtained from renewable sources as indicated in the Experimental section, n-butylamine is not yet commercially available from bio-derived sources, but n-butanol is and can be transformed to n-butylamine quite readily. Similarly, maleic anhydride itself is not available commercially from bio-derived sources at present but its potential precursors, namely 1,4 butanediol and succinic acid are commercially available from bio- derived sources via fermentation. Meanwhile tetradecylamine can be derived primarily from coconut oil, and is known commercially as cocoamine, or from myristicin which is isolated from nutmeg oil obtained from the nutmeg tree, genus Myristica. 1,10 diaminodecane is commercially available for use in making bio-nylons being obtained from castor bean oil, extracted from the castor oil plant, Ricinus communis. [000213] Similarly, citraconic anhydride can be obtained from itaconic anhydride or acid which is made by heat treating citric acid. Citric acid is commercially obtained by the fermentation of sugars, e.g. fructose, beet syrup, etc. Thus the described reaction sequences above describe the novel preparation of a bio-derived aliphatic polyimide of high molecular weight from bio-derived monomers.
