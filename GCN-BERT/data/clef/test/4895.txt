FIELD OF INVENTION The present invention relates to a curable epoxy resin composition. The present invention also relates to a process for preparing the composition and a composite comprising a reinforcing fiber embedded in a thermoset resin made from the composition. BACKGROUND ART Epoxy resin compositions have been widely used in a wide range of applications for their temperature resistance and mechanical properties such as tensile and flexural properties. Epoxy resin compositions are particularly useful for fiber-reinforced composites. Fiber-reinforced composites comprise cured epoxy resins as a polymer matrix with fibers (for example, glass fibers and carbon fibers) embedded therein. Many applications for fiber-reinforced composites require a cured epoxy resin having high thermal resistance, that is, a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 160 degree Celsius (° C.) or higher. It is thus desirable to simultaneously increase mechanical properties such as tensile properties and flexural properties, while maintaining or increasing thermal resistance. In particular, it is desirable for the tensile elongation property of the cured epoxy resin to be high enough so that the polymer matrix formed therefrom will not break, before the fibers break which are embedded within the polymer matrix. However, increasing tensile elongation typically tends to decrease thermal resistance. In addition, components in epoxy resin compositions must be compatible with each other to remain as a homogeneous composition throughout processing. A typical process for manufacturing fiber-reinforced composites comprises the steps of: loading a batch of an epoxy resin composition into a resin bath, drawing fibers through the epoxy resin composition in order to impregnate the fibers with the epoxy resin, and curing the resin impregnated in the fibers to form a fiber-reinforced composite. A typical residence time for an epoxy resin composition in a bath during processing can be eight hours or more at a processing temperature of from 20 to 45° C. The epoxy resin composition should remain a homogeneous mixture throughout that residence time. Thus, the components of the epoxy resin composition must be sufficiently compatible so as to remain homogeneous (that is, avoid phase separation) during the residence time in the bath. Incompatibility between the components of the epoxy resin composition results in phase separation during residence in the bath, typically causing the resulting fiber-reinforced composite to have one or more of the following undesirable properties: rough surface, inconsistent properties and/or a reduction of mechanical properties such as tensile and flexural properties. Therefore, it is desirable to provide a curable epoxy resin composition, wherein the composition upon curing increases one or more of tensile properties, flexural properties and Tg without concomitantly decreasing any of those properties significantly relative to a conventional technology. It is also desirable that the components of a curable epoxy resin composition have sufficient compatibility with each other so that the composition exhibits no phase separation for at least eight hours at 25° C. after mixing. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a curable epoxy resin composition that comprises a novel combination of the following components: (a) a cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, (b) an oxazolidone ring-containing epoxy resin, (c) a reaction product of (i) an anhydride and (ii) a polyol, and (d) an anhydride hardener. Research leading to the present invention has revealed that an incumbent epoxy resin composition comprising a cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, an oxazolidone ring-containing epoxy resin, a conventional polyol toughening agent and an anhydride hardener, can afford a cured epoxy resin with high thermal resistance (Tg), but this epoxy resin composition phase separated within 8 hours at 25° C. after mixing. Comparative Example A, herein below, demonstrates this observation. When the conventional polyol toughening agent is replaced with the component (c) described above, the curable epoxy resin composition of the present invention surprisingly exhibits no phase separation for at least eight hours at 25° C. after mixing. Upon curing, the curable epoxy resin composition of the present invention also exhibits higher flexural stress, flexural strain and/or tensile elongation than incumbent epoxy resin compositions that do not contain component (b) and/or (c). At the same time, the curable epoxy resin composition has Tg comparable to the incumbent epoxy resin compositions upon curing. In a first aspect, the present invention includes a curable epoxy resin composition comprising: (a) a cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, (b) an oxazolidone ring-containing epoxy resin, (c) a reaction product of (i) an anhydride compound and (ii) a polyol, and (d) an anhydride hardener. In a second aspect, the present invention includes a process for preparing the above curable epoxy resin composition of the first aspect, wherein the process comprises admixing (a) a cycloaliphatic epoxy resin, (b) an oxazolidone ring-containing epoxy resin, (c) a reaction product of (i) an anhydride compound and (ii) a polyol, and (d) an anhydride hardener. In a third aspect, the present invention is a composite comprising a reinforcing fiber embedded in a thermoset resin, wherein the thermoset resin is a reaction product of the curable epoxy resin composition of the first aspect.

Generally, the amount of the oxazolidone ring-containing epoxy resin may be 35 wt % or less, 30 wt % or less, or even 25 wt % or less. Wt % of the oxazolidone ring-containing epoxy resin is based on the total epoxy resin weight in the curable epoxy resin composition.

At the same time, the molar ratio of the total epoxy resins to the hardener can be 1:2 or higher, 1:1.5 or higher, 1:1.25 or higher, or even 1:1 or higher. The curable epoxy resin composition of the present invention also comprises a reaction product of (i) an anhydride compound and (ii) a polyol (“Anhydride Reaction Product”). Preferably, the Anhydride Reaction Product contains carboxylic acid group(s). Hydroxyl groups of the polyol may react with the anhydride group(s) of the anhydride compound to form a half-ester, which comprises ester group(s) and carboxylic acid group(s).Upon curing the curable epoxy resin composition, carboxyl group(s) in the Anhydride Reaction Product can further react with epoxy group(s) of the epoxy resins to form a homogenously cured epoxy resin. Compared to the Anhydride Reaction Product containing carboxyl group(s), a conventional polyol has lower reactivity with the epoxy group(s) of epoxy resins. A cured epoxy resin made from a curable epoxy resin composition comprising the conventional polyol toughening agent usually still contains unreacted polyol, which tends to migrate to the surface of the cured epoxy resin. The curable epoxy resin composition of the present invention upon curing may be free from migration problems associated with the conventional polyol toughening agents. The Anhydride Reaction Product may have an acid value of 10 milligram potassium hydroxide per gram sample (mg KOH/g) or more, 30 mg KOH/g or more, or even 40 mg KOH/g or more. At the same time, the acid value of the Anhydride Reaction Product may be 90 mg KOH/g or less, 70 mg KOH/g or less, or even 60 mg KOH/g or less. The acid value, that is, the number of milligrams of KOH per gram of solid required to neutralize the acid functionality in a resin, is a measure of the amount of acid functionality. Acid value may be determined by the testing method described in the Examples below. The viscosity of the Anhydride Reaction Product may be 30,000 millipascal·seconds (mPa·s) or less, 20,000 mPa·s or less, or even 10,000 mPa·s or less, as determined by ASTM D-2196 at 25° C.

The polyol used to prepare the Anhydride Reaction Product may desirably have a number average molecular weight of generally from 1,000 to 20,000 gram per mole, from 4,000 to 16,000 gram per mole, or even from 6,000 to 15,000 gram per mole. If the number average molecular weight of the polyol is lower than 1,000, the curable epoxy resin composition may not be able to provide cured epoxy resins with high thermal resistance. The Anhydride Reaction Product in the curable epoxy resin composition can be prepared by conventional methods. For example, the reaction can be conducted at a temperature of 60° C. or more, 80° C. or more, or even 100° C. or more. At the same time, the reaction temperature can be 160° C. or less, 140° C. or less, or even 120° C. or less. In preparing the Anhydride Reaction Product, the mole ratio of the anhydride compound to the polyol may be from 20 to 1, from 10 to 1, or even one.

The content of unreacted polyol existed in the Anhydride Reaction Product obtained is desirably less than 5,000 parts per million (ppm), less than 4,000 ppm, less than 1,000 ppm, or even zero ppm, so as to minimize adverse effects of the unreacted polyol on the compatibility between components of the curable epoxy resin composition. The anhydride compound may react with the polyol in the presence of a catalyst, for example, an amine catalyst.

The catalysts, when present in the curable epoxy resin composition, are employed in a sufficient amount to result in a substantially complete cure of the curable epoxy resin composition, with at least some cross-linking. For example, the catalyst, when used, may be used in an amount of from 0.01 to 5 parts per hundred parts (phr) by weight of total epoxy resins in the curable epoxy resin composition, from 0.1 to 4 phr, or even from 0.2 phr to 3 phr. The curable epoxy resin composition of the present invention may optionally comprise an additional epoxy resin. The additional epoxy resin (or “second epoxy”) useful in the present invention may be any type of epoxy resins, including any material containing one or more reactive oxirane groups, referred to herein as “epoxy groups” or “epoxy functionality”. The additional epoxy resin may include for example mono-functional epoxy resins, multi- or poly-functional epoxy resins, and combinations thereof. The additional epoxy resins may be pure compounds, but are generally mixtures or compounds containing one, two or more epoxy groups per molecule. The additional epoxy resin may also be for example monomeric or polymeric. The additional epoxy resins may also include for example reactive —OH groups, which may react at higher temperatures with anhydrides, organic acids, amino resins, phenolic resins, or with epoxy groups (when catalyzed) to result in additional crosslinking. Examples of the additional epoxy resins useful in the present invention may include epoxy phenolic novolac resins, cresol novolac type epoxy resins, multifunctional (polyepoxy) epoxy resins, bisphenol A-based epoxy resins, bisphenol F-based epoxy resins, and mixtures thereof.

For example, the amount of the additional epoxy resin used herein may be generally 10 wt % or less, 5 wt % or less, or even 1 wt % or less of the total epoxy resin weight in the curable epoxy resin composition. If the amount of the additional epoxy resins is higher than 10 wt %, Tg of cured epoxy resins made therefrom may be lower than 160° C. In addition to the anhydride hardeners described above, the curable epoxy resin composition of the present invention may optionally comprise additional hardeners (or curing agents) for promoting crosslinking of the curable epoxy resin composition.

Viscosity Viscosity of an epoxy resin composition is measured in accordance with ASTM D-2196 at 25° C. Acid Value The acid value of a sample is defined as milligrams potassium hydroxide per gram sample (mg KOH/g). To determine acid value, a weighed sample is completely dissolved in acetone to form a sample solution. Then, excessive KOH standard solution (concentration: 0.1 molar per liter (mol/L)) is added into the sample solution using a pipette and stirred for 10 minutes. Then KOH is titrated with HCl solution (concentration: 0.1 mol/L) by a Mettler DL-55 Titrator until the solution shows neutral. The acid value (X1) of the sample is measured as [in-line-formulae]X1=(C1V1−C2V2)*56.11/m [/in-line-formulae] where in the above equation, C1 refers to the concentration of KOH solution, mol/L; V1 refers to the volume of KOH solution added into the sample solution, mL; C2 refers to the concentration of HCl solution, mol/L; V2 refers to the volume of HCl solution used to titrate KOH, mL; and m refers to the weight of the sample, grams. Glass Transition Temperature Glass transition temperature (Tg) is measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).

A 5-10 milligram (mg) sample is analyzed in an open aluminum pan on a TA Instrument DSC Q2000 fitted with an auto-sampler under nitrogen. Mechanical Properties Tensile properties are measured using an Instron 5566 in accordance with ISO 527 (test speed: 2 millimeter per minute (mm/min), gauge length: 50 mm). Flexural properties are measured using an Instron 5566 in accordance with ISO 178 (test speed: 2 mm/min, support span: 16*D mm, where D refers to the thickness of samples). Compatibility Evaluation Compatibility is determined by mixing ingredients, such as the ingredients described in Table 1, respectively, to form the curable epoxy resin compositions of Example 1-2, Comparative Example A and C. Each epoxy resin composition is stirred by a disperser at 900 revolutions per minute (rpm) for 10 minutes. The resultant homogeneous mixture is poured into a bottle, then the bottle is left sitting at 25° C. for 8 hours. After that, the mixture is visually observed. If the mixture shows no signs of phase separation by visual observation, the components of such epoxy resin composition is deemed to have sufficient compatibility with each other. Otherwise, if the mixture shows phase separation, it means the components of such epoxy resin composition do not have sufficient compatibility with each other.

Examples 1-2 and Comparative Examples A-C Epoxy resin compositions were formed by mixing the ingredients described in Table 1. The epoxy resin compositions were stirred by a disperser at 900 rpm for 10 minutes, followed by vacuum degassing at 60° C. until no bubbles were visible. The degassed mixtures were poured into pre-heated glass molds for curing. Castings were made by curing the molds containing the compositions. The castings were cured in an oven at 90° C. for 2 hours, at 140° C. for 2 hours, and at 220° C. for 2 hours. Cured castings were slowly cooled down to room temperature (about 23° C.) in the oven. The compatibility of the ingredients described in Table 1 was determined by the compatibility evaluation method described above. The results of this compatibility evaluation are described in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, epoxy resin compositions of the present invention (Examples 1-2) exhibited no phase separation for at least 8 hours at 25° C. after mixing, which indicates sufficient compatibility between components of the epoxy resin compositions.
