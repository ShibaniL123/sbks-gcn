Aliphatic polycarbonates (APCs) are biocompatible and biodegradable materials with numerous uses ranging from high-performance applications in material science to use as biodegradable consumer packaging. APCs having two carbon atoms separating the carbonate moieties are typically made by the copolymerization of an aliphatic oxide and CO2. Such polymerization reactions are typically initiated through the use of a catalyst, and therefore, require a quenching step to terminate the resulting copolymerization. Thus, there is a need for improved methods for making APCs and improved methods for quenching the copolymerization reaction that form such APCs. Catalytic transition metal-ligand complexes, for example cobalt salen complexes, can be used to catalyze aliphatic polycarbonate(APC) polymerization reactions. Previously such polymerization reactions have typically been quenched by addition of carboxylic acids such as acetic acid, or with mineral acids such as HCl. In many such cases, a large molar excess of these reagents is required to provide a stable polymer product. If a large excess of acid is not used in the quench, the crude reaction mixtures may be unstable and show decomposition or molecular weight degradation upon standing or heating during subsequent polymer isolation steps. On the other hand, the presence of large amounts of acid can also have undesirable consequences for subsequent isolation and purification steps. Therefore, in certain situations it may be desirable to use a quenching agent that does not require a molar excess, or as large a molar excess relative to the catalyst utilized in the polymerization. In general, aliphatic polycarbonate polymerization reactions involve three stages: an initiating stage, a polymerization stage, and a quenching stage. Herein we describe agents that are useful for the quenching stage that do not require a large molar excess of the quenching agent relative to the catalyst used in the reaction. In particular, the present disclosure encompasses methods including the steps of initiating a polycarbonate polymerization reaction by combining an epoxide with carbon dioxide in the presence of a catalytic transition metal-ligand complex, allowing the copolymerization to proceed until a desired polymer molecular weight is achieved, and then quenching that polymerization reaction by contacting the reaction mixture with an acid containing a non-nucleophilic anion. In certain embodiments, this process produces a crude polymer solution with improved stability and processability, and thus possesses a greater utility use in commercial scale production of APCs. In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a method comprising initiating an aliphatic polycarbonate polymerization reaction by combining an epoxide with carbon dioxide in the presence of a catalytic transition metal-ligand complex, allowing the copolymerization to proceed until a desired polymer molecular weight is achieved, and then quenching the polymerization reaction by contacting the reaction mixture with an acid wherein the catalytic transition metal-ligand complex comprises a first ligand that is a polymerization initiator and at least one additional ligand that is not a polymerization initiator, and wherein the acid contains an anion that is not a polymerization initiator. In another aspect, the present disclosure provides a method comprising initiating an aliphatic polycarbonate polymerization reaction by combining an epoxide with carbon dioxide in the presence of a catalytic transition metal-ligand complex, wherein the catalytic transition metal-ligand complex comprises a first ligand that is a polymerization initiator, and at least one additional ligand that is not a polymerization initiator, allowing the copolymerization to proceed until a desired polymer molecular weight is achieved, and then quenching the polymerization reaction by contacting the reaction mixture with a combination of an acid and a quench ligand that is not a polymerization initiator, wherein the quench ligand has a higher affinity for the transition metal of transition metal-ligand complex than the polycarbonate chain and the anion of the acid do.

In certain embodiments, the APC polymer is a copolymer of two or more C2-C12 epoxides and carbon dioxide. For example, the APC polymer can be a terpolymer of propylene oxide, cyclohexene oxide and carbon dioxide.

In certain embodiments of the present disclosure the APC polymer is a heteropolymer of three or more C2 to C12 epoxides and carbon dioxide. In certain other embodiments, the APC polymer is a heteropolymer of any three or more of the epoxides described above and carbon dioxide. In certain embodiments, the APC polymer is a block co-polymer of two or more of any of the above-described APC compositions. In certain embodiments, the polymers include ether linkages. Polymers in these embodiments can be mixed polyether polycarbonates, pure polyethers or block copolymers of two or more of these. In certain embodiments, the APC polymer is a polycarbonate chain. In certain embodiments, the polycarbonate chain is poly(propylene carbonate) (PPC). In certain embodiments, the polycarbonate chain is poly(ethylene carbonate) (PEC). In certain embodiments, the polycarbonate chain is poly(butylene carbonate) (PBC). In certain embodiments, the polycarbonate chain is poly(cyclohexene carbonate) (PCHC). In certain embodiments, the polycarbonate chain is poly(limonene carbonate) (PLC). In certain embodiments, the polycarbonate chain is poly(norbornene carbonate) (PNC). As shown in Scheme I below, a catalytic transition metal-ligand complex (i.e., an active catalyst) for aliphatic polycarbonate (APC) synthesis may be generated by oxidizing an inactive catalyst to obtain the active catalyst by the addition of a suitable acid to a suitable metal-ligand complex (i.e., an inactive catalyst), in the presence of oxygen. Exemplary suitable acids include acetic acid (AcOH), trifluoroacetic acid, pentafluorobenzoic acid, and others described herein. An exemplary metal-ligand complex is (salcy)CoII. An exemplary active catalyst is (salcy)CoIIIOAc. Not all acids, however, generate an active catalyst complex for a given metal/ligand combination. For example, AcOH generates an active CoIII salen complex while TsOH generates an essentially inactive specie from the same metal ligand combination. Once a polymerization is complete, the reaction must be quenched to decouple the APC chain from the active catalyst. If the catalyst remains attached to the polymer chain, the molecular weight of the polymer can be compromised during its isolation, either yielding broadened molecular weight distribution or complete molecular weight loss (see Schemes II, III and IV as described below). In certain embodiments, the reaction mixture is heated to a temperature in the range of about 35 °C to about 120 °C. In certain embodiments, the reaction mixture is heated to a temperature in the range of about 40 °C to about 100 °C. In certain embodiments, the reaction mixture is heated to a temperature in the range of about 45 °C to about 70 °C. In certain embodiments, the reaction mixture is heated under a pressure in the range of about 1 atm to about 0.05 atm. In certain embodiments, the reaction mixture is heated under a pressure in the range of about 1 atm to about 0.001 atm. In certain embodiments, the reaction mixture is heated under a pressure in the range of about 0.2 atm to about 0.1 atm.

In certain embodiments, the solvent added prior to the quenching step has a higher boiling point than the epoxide boiling point. In certain embodiments, the solvent added prior to the quenching step is selected from ethyl acetate, n-propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, acetone, butanone, gamma butyrolactone, tetrahydrofuran, and mixtures of two or more of the above. In certain embodiments, the solvent to be added for the dilution step is mixed with the quenching agent prior to addition to the polymerization reaction mixture. In certain other embodiments, the diluting solvent is added to the polymerization reaction mixture concomitantly with quenching agent. In certain embodiments, additional heat is applied to the reactor after the quenching step is performed. In certain embodiments, additional heat applied to the reactor after the quenching step is performed, results in removal of excess epoxide that may be present. Methods of synthesizing a poly(ethylene carbonate) polymer from the reaction of ethylene oxide (EO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the presence of a metal complex are described in detail in PCT Application No. PCT/US2009/04296. II. Quenching the Aliphatic Polycarbonate Polymerization Reaction In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a method which includes a step subsequent of quenching the polymerization reaction by contacting the reaction mixture with an acid containing an anion that is not a polymerization initiator, as generally described in Scheme II below. APC was isolated and processed using acetic acid (AcOH) as a quenching agent. During scale-up, where processing times and temperatures sometimes exceed the typical laboratory-scale conditions, molecular weight degradation was sometimes observed. A solution to this problem of undesired degradation was to add more quenching agent. A typical lab-scale quench used ~10-80 molar equivalents of AcOH relative to cobalt. However, to completely terminate any molecular weight degradation, 800 molar equivalents of AcOH was required. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the catalyst-acetate complex formed by the quench reaction is in equilibrium with the catalyst-polymer complex. Once CO2 is removed from the polymerization reaction, the presence of catalyst-polymer complex can lead to the scission of polymer chains. Higher concentrations of AcOH shift the equilibrium away from the catalyst-polymer complex and result in less degradation of the polymer chains. As a result of the equilibrium conditions described above, a quenched catalyst such as a (salcy)CoOAc species for example, can be created and therefore, one skilled in art will readily determine whether such a "quenched" catalyst is desirable under the particular circumstances, given that an active catalyst can be formed, which in turn requires excess molar equivalents to sufficiently quench the reaction, as described in Scheme III below. However, we have discovered that it may be desirable to use for the quenching step a different acid containing an anion that is not a polymerization initiator, and that is not therefore required in molar excess relative to the catalyst. An exemplary quenching agent of this type is a sulfonic acid. Therefore, a quenched catalyst species that does not form an equilibrium product mixture with the polymer chains in solution, and that does not form the structure of an active polymerization catalyst, may be desirable, as described in Scheme IV below. In particular, quenching with 1 equivalent of TsOH yields a thermally stable and processable reaction mixture. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that Scheme IV sets forth a possible quenching mechanism. In certain embodiments, the acid is a sulfonic acid. In certain embodiments, the sulfonic acid has the formula R1SO3H, wherein R1 is a radical selected from the group consisting of optionally substituted aliphatic, optionally substituted aryl, optionally substituted heterocyclic, and optionally substituted heteroaryl. In certain embodiments, R1 is a radical selected from optionally substituted C1 to C20 alkyl, C1 to C20 alkenyl, and an optionally substituted phenyl. In certain embodiments, the sulfonic acid is selected from the group consisting of p-toluene sulfonic acid (also known as PTSA or tosic acid), methane sulfonic acid, ethane sulfonic acid, 1-propane sulfonic acid, trifluoromethyl sulfonic acid, 4-nitrophenyl sulfonic acid, sulfoacetic acid, cumenesulphonic acid, xylene sulfonic acid, 3-amino-1-propanesulfonic acid, 2-(methylamino)ethanesulfonic acid, 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, 2-sulfanylethanesulfonic acid, 3-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, 3-pyridinesulfonic acid, 2-pyridinesulfonic acid, 4-piperidinesulfonic acid, 2-aminobenzenesulfonic acid, 1-methylpyridinium 3-sulfonate, 1-methyl-2-pyridiniumsulfonate, 4-hydroxybenzenesulfonic acid, cyclohexane sulfonic acid, 4-ethylbenzenesulfonic acid, 2,5-dimethylbenzenesulfonic acid, 4-methylmetanilic acid, 4-amino-3-methylbenzenesulfonic acid, 1-Naphthalenesulfonic acid, 2-amino-5-methylbenzenesulfonic acid, and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid.

In certain embodiments, the quenching step of the above method comprises adding an acid associated with a solid support. In certain embodiments, the solid support is selected from an inorganic solid support and a polymeric solid support. In certain embodiments, the inorganic solid support is selected from silica, alumina, zirconia, titania, zeolites, metal oxides, and clays. In certain embodiments, the polymeric solid support comprises at least one of styrene, chloromethylated styrene and divynylbenzene. In certain embodiments, the polymeric solid support is selected from polystyrenes, polysulfones, nylons, poly(chloromethylstyrene); polyolefins, polymethylmethacrylate and cross-linked ethoxylate acrylate resin polymer. In certain embodiments, the acid containing the anion in the quenching step is added to the reaction mixture in an amount of less than 10 molar equivalents relative to the transition metal-ligand complex present in the reaction mixture. In certain embodiments, the acid containing the anion in the quenching step is added to the reaction mixture in an amount of between 0.1 and 10 molar equivalents relative to the transition metal-ligand complex present in the reaction mixture. In certain embodiments, the acid containing the anion in the quenching step is added to the reaction mixture in an amount of between 0.1 and 2 molar equivalents relative to the transition metal-ligand complex present in the reaction mixture. In certain embodiments, the acid containing the anion in the quenching step is added to the reaction mixture in an amount of between 1 and 2 molar equivalents relative to the transition metal-ligand complex present in the reaction mixture. In certain embodiments, the acid containing the anion in the quenching step is added to the reaction mixture in an amount of about 1 molar equivalent relative to the transition metal-ligand complex present in the reaction mixture. In another aspect, the quenching step involves adding to the reaction mixture a chain transfer agent and a ligand, wherein the added ligand is not a polymerization initiator, the chain transfer agent comprises a species capable of causing the transition metal-ligand complex to dissociate from the polycarbonate chain, and the added ligand has a higher affinity for the transition metal of the transition metal-ligand complex than does either of the polycarbonate chain or chain transfer agent. In certain embodiments, the quenching step involves adding a chain transfer agent. In certain embodiments, the chain transfer agent is selected from water, an alcohol, a carboxylic acid, an amine, and a mercaptan. Chain transfer agents for use with methods of the present invention include, but are not limited to, carboxylic acids, alcohols, dicarboxylic acids, diols, poly acids, polyols, and their deprotonated forms In certain embodiments, the chain transfer agent in the quenching step is present in an amount from about 0.001% to about 2% by mass with respect to the total amount of the polycarbonate chain. In certain embodiments, the quenching step comprises adding a ligand that is not a polymerization initiator, wherein the added ligand has a higher affinity for the transition metal of the transition metal-ligand complex than does either a product polycarbonate chain, or an anion of the added chain transfer agent. The ligand present in the quenching step is a sulfonate salt (e.g., a sodium sulfonate salt). In certain embodiments, the ligand present in the quenching step is added to the reaction mixture in an amount of less than 10 equivalents relative to the amount of catalytic transition metal-ligand complex present in the reaction mixture. In certain embodiments, the ligand present in the quenching step is added to the reaction mixture in an amount of between 0.1 and 10 equivalents relative to the amount of catalytic transition metal-ligand complex present in the reaction mixture.

In certain embodiments, the quenching step is performed at a temperature in the range of about 0 °C to about 50 °C. In certain embodiments, the quenching step is performed at a temperature in the range of about 10 °C to about 30 °C. In certain embodiments, the quenching step is performed at room temperature. In one aspect, the present disclosure provides a method which includes an initiating step for an aliphatic polycarbonate polymerization reaction by combining an epoxide with carbon dioxide in the presence of a catalytic transition metal-ligand complex to form a reaction mixture comprising a polycarbonate chain, wherein the polymerization reaction is performed in a reactor, the method further comprising: depressurizing the reactor containing the reaction mixture, removing excess carbon dioxide from the reactor, and diluting the reaction mixture by adding a solvent prior to the quenching step. In certain embodiments, additional heat is applied to the reactor after the quenching step is performed. In certain embodiments, additional heat applied to the reactor after the quenching step is performed, results in removal of excess epoxide that may be present. EXAMPLE 1 Acetic acid quench tests in vials Background: During a large scale synthesis of PPC (in a 400-gallon reactor) of making PPC, the polymerization was successful but breakdown of molecular weight was observed after the quench and dilute step of the process (see Figure 1). The same was then observed in a smaller scale reaction (2-gallon reactor) (see Figure 2). More attention was directed to understanding the quenching step of the process. Particular focus was placed on understanding t the thermal stability of the polymer after the quench. Procedure: A. A PPC polymerization was conducted in the 2-gallon reactor. When the molecular weight (as determined via GPC) had reached the target, 200 grams of the dope was withdrawn from the pot and diluted with 200 grams of propyl acetate. The composition of the dope at this point was approximately 50 wt% propyl acetate, 30 wt% propylene oxide, and 20 wt% PPC polymer. B. A sample of this diluted dope was withdrawn and prepared for GPC analysis. C. 8 grams of dope was poured into each of four 20-mL scintillation vials, and a magnetic stir bar added. D. Various amounts of acetic acid were added to the vials, and the vials were stirred overnight (17 hours) at 80 °C on a reaction block. The acid additions were as follows: Control: no acetic acid1/10-quench: 8 molar equivalents of AcOH relative to catalystRegular quench: 80 molar equivalents of AcOH relative to catalyst10x quench: 800 molar equivalents of AcOH relative to catalyst Results: Original diluted dope, before exposure to heat: Mw=249,904 (orange/yellow) After 17 hours at 80 C: Control (no acetic acid): Mw = 134,892 (deep red/orange) 1/10-quench: Mw = 137,523 (deep red/orange) Regular quench: Mw = 24,326 (orange/yellow) 10x quench: Mw = 241,897 (pale yellow) Also see Figure 3. The polydispersity index (PD) reported as part of the GPC analysis is also an indication of polymer degradation. The PD of the control was 1.3, as also was the "10x" stable sample. However, the other samples that showed degradation of MW also showed a PD increase to 1.6 or more. Conclusions: The only sample that did not exhibit significant breakdown in MW was the 10x quench vial (800 molar equivalents AcOH relative to catalyst). In order to produce a dope that is thermally stable with regard to molecular weight in this experiment, a significant excess of this quench agent must be present. In all cases, polymer degradation was indicated by a combination of three factors: a) significant (>10%) reduction of MW relative to the controlb) concomitant increase in polydispersity relative to the controlc) change in the shape of the GPC trace relative to the control, illustrating the disappearance of higher molecular weight fractions of the population, and an increase in lower molecular weight fractions, with an overall broadening of the curve (see Figure 7). EXAMPLE 2 Two additional acetic acid quench tests in vials These experiments were conducted in similar fashion to the previous experiment, to repeat and further develop the results of the previous experiment. Results: See Figure 4; and Figure 5. Conclusions: PPC dope that is unquenched or under-quenched with acetic acid will exhibit MW breakdown when exposed to heat. However, when 500-800 molar equivalents of AcOH are present, the MW is stable. Therefore, the breakdown in MW seen in large scale reactions and at laboratory scale resulted from insufficient quenching of the polymer dope. That is, the catalyst remained in such a state of activity that under the proper conditions it would catalyze the depolymerization of the PPC chains. Not wishing to be bound by theory, a hypothesis to explain this was that the acetic acid was not disabling the catalyst, but rather "tying it up" or "keeping it busy" by acting as a chain transfer agent. In excess, this type of interaction will effectively keep the active catalyst from binding polymer chains, thereby protecting them from degradation. Likewise, insufficient excess of acetic acid will leave some catalyst available to act upon polymer chains. EXAMPLE 3 Large scale reaction with 10x acetic acid quench The previously discussed vial experiments were repeated several times with consistent results. With confidence that more acetic acid would produce a thermally stable polymer dope, a second large scale reaction (400-gallon reactor) was conducted. This time, the MW after the quench was stable. See Figure 6. EXAMPLE 4 Alternate acid quench agents Background: Other acidic quench agents, namely para-toluenesulfonic acid (pTSA), methanesulfonic acid (MSA), and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid ("triflic") were screened to determine their effectiveness as quench agents. Procedure: A. PPC polymer was prepared in a pressurized reactor as previously described, then diluted with propyl acetate to yield a dope of approximately 50 wt% propyl acetate, 30 wt% propylene oxide, and 20 wt% PPC polymer. B. A solution of pTSA was prepared in propyl acetate, and added to dope in vials to yield pTSA loadings of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 molar equivalents pTSA relative to catalyst. C. The vials were stirred on an 80 °C reaction block for 15 hours, and then samples prepared for GPC analysis. D. Likewise, vials of dope were prepared and charged with 1 and 2 molar equivalents each of MSA, pTSA, and triflic acid. These vials were also stirred overnight at 80 °C and analyzed later for molecular weight. Results: See Figure 8. The addition of 1 and 2 molar equivalents relative to catalyst of pTSA led to thermally stable PPC dope. Vials with lesser amounts of pTSA exhibited polymer degradation, as did the control. See Figure 9. Each of the acids tested resulted in stable polymer dope. Conclusion: pTSA, MSA, and triflic acid are effective quench agents for the catalyst, with just 1 molar equivalent relative to catalyst. This is especially significant in contrast to the 800 molar equivalents of acetic acid previously required to produce thermally stable polymer dope. In theory, these acids actually bind the catalyst and disable it, thereby effectively preventing the catalyst from interacting with polymer chains as described above.
