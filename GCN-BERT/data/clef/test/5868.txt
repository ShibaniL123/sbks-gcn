Step B: 2-Chloro-3-(difluoromethyl)-5-methylpyridin-1-ium-1-amine;2,4,6-trimethylbenzenesulfonate. To a mixture of trifluoroacetic acid (15 mL, 196 mmol) and water (1.8 mL) was added ethyl o-mesitylsulfonylacetohydroxamate (4.10 g, 14.4 mmol) at −5° C. The reaction mixture was stirred at −5° C. for 1.5 h. To the reaction mixture was added ice water (25 mL). The precipitate was collected and washed with water (20×25 mL). The white solid was dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered. To the filtrate was added 2-chloro-3-(difluoromethyl)-5-methylpyridine (1.70 g, 9.57 mmol) at 0° C. The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature and stirred at room temperature for 18 h. The reaction mixture was diluted slowly with diethyl ether (100 mL). The precipitate was collected and washed with diethyl ether (2×20 mL) to give the title compound (2.59 g, 6.50 mmol, 68%) as a white crystalline solid.
