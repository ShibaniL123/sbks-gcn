A solution of (±)-ethyl (1R*,2S*)-2-methyl-4-oxocyclopentane-1-carboxylate (16a, 10 g, 59 mmol) in ethanol (300 mL) was chilled to 0° C. under nitrogen. Sodium borohydride (1.11 g, 29.4 mmol) was added in small portions. The reaction was allowed to stir at 0° C. for 1 hour. The reaction was quenched by the slow addition of sat. aq. ammonium chloride solution (50 mL), followed by water (50 mL) to dissolve any solids. Ethanol was removed under reduced pressure and the aqueous residue extracted with MTBE (2×300 mL). The combined organics were washed with sat. aq. NaCl (500 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give (±)-ethyl (1R*,2S*,4R*)-4-hydroxy-2-methylcyclopentane-1-carboxylate (16b, 9.9 g, 97%) as a yellow oil.
