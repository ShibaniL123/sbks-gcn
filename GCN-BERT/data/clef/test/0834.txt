Step 9: tert-butyl (2R,3S)-2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-5-oxotetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-ylcarbamate
Tert-butyl (2R,3S)-2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-5-hydroxyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-ylcarbamate (2.33 g, 7.08 mmol) was dissolved in a mixed solution of 24 mL acetonitrile, 4 mL water and 4 mL acetic acid. Thereto was added an aqueous solution (4 mL) of ruthenium chloride hydrate (3.7 mg, 0.0142 mmol), and cooled to 0 °C. Sodium bromate (535 mg, 3.54 mmol) was added, and stirred at low temperature for about 1.5 hours until the raw materials were completely reacted. To the reaction solution was added 120 mL water, stirred at 0 °C overnight, and extracted with dichloromethane. The organic phase was washed with water, dried and concentrated, and then the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, 10:1) to give the intermediate 1 tert-butyl (2R,3S)-2-(2,5-difluorophenyl)-5-oxotetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-ylcarbamate (1.71 g) as a white solid in 74% yield.
