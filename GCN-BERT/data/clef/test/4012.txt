It is noted that the cushion member 252, the comfort member 184 and the second portion 123 of the back shell 112 are assembled with the topper cushion 253 prior to assembly with the cover assembly 300, and specifically are attached to a rear surface of the topper cushion 253 via an adhesive. In assembly, the first pocket 306 is formed by attaching the respective side edges of the front side 302 and the rear side 304 to one another such as by sewing or other means suitable for the material for which the cover assembly 300 is comprised, and to define the first interior space 308. An edge of the flap portion 310 is then secured to the rear side 304 proximate a midsection 312 thereof. In the illustrated example, the comfort member 184 and the second portion 123 of the back shell 112 are placed within a fixture 301 (FIG. 18B) that holds the second portion 123 in a planar relationship to the comfort member 184. The combination of the second portion 123 of the back shell 164, the comfort member 184 and the cushion member 296 are then inserted into the interior space 308 of the first pocket 306 via an aperture 314 located on the rear side 304 (FIG. 18B). The upholstery cover assembly 300 is stretched about the cushion member 252, the second portion 123 of the back shell 112 and the comfort member 184, and is secured to the comfort member 184 by a plurality of apertures 320 that receive upwardly extending hook members 324 (FIG. 19) therethrough. Alternatively, the cover assembly 300 may be configured such that apertures 320 are positioned to also receive T-shaped attachment members 322 therethrough. In the illustrated example, the attachment members 322 and the hook members 324 are integrally formed with the comfort member 184. Each attachment member 322 is provided with a T-shaped cross-section or boat-cleat configuration having a first portion 328 extending perpendicularly rearward from within a recess 329 of the rear surface 256 of the comfort member 184, and a pair of second portions 330 located at a distal end of the first portion 328 and extending outwardly therefrom in opposite relation to one another. One of the second portions 330 cooperates with the first portion 328 to form an angled engagement surface 332. The recess 329 defines an edge 334 about the perimeter thereof. The cover assembly 300 is further secured to the comfort member 184 by a single, continuous drawstring 336 that extends through a drawstring tunnel 338 of the cover assembly 300, which is captured within multiple attachment features of the second portion 123 of the back shell 112 and the comfort member 184 and is in turn secured to the attachment members 322. Specifically, the drawstring 336 and drawstring tunnel 338 are aligned with and secured to the plurality of upholstery alignment and connection pads 199′ (FIG. 20A) similar to the pads 199 (FIG. 20B) of the comfort member 184 via a plurality of staples (not shown). Alternatively, the drawstring 336 and drawstring tunnel 338 are routed about hook members 313 (FIG. 20C) located near the corners between the bottom edge 127 and side edges 129 of the second portion 123 of the back shell 112, and are captured by a plurality of couplers 315 each including a plurality of elastically resilient, interspaced teeth 317 and spaced about the periphery of the second portion 123. The drawstring 336 and drawstring tunnel 338 are then aligned with the pads 199 of the second portion 123 to assure proper alignment of the cover assembly 300 with the back shell 112 and the overall back support assembly 99. In the illustrated example, the drawstring 336 and drawstring tunnel 338 are secured to the second portion via a plurality of staples 319 which are inserted into the thicker pads 199. As best illustrated in FIGS. 21A-21H, the drawstring 336 is drawn taut and each free end of the drawstring 336 is then secured to an associated attachment member 322 in a knot-free manner and without the use of a mechanical fastener that is separate from the comfort member 184, thereby fixing the effective length of the drawstring 336 through the remainder of the assembly process. The drawstring 336 is wrapped about the associated attachment member 322 such that the tension in the drawstring 336 about the attachment member 322 forces the drawstring 366 against the engagement surface 332 that angles towards the recess 329, thereby forcing a portion of the drawstring 336 into the recess 329 and into engagement with at least a portion of the edge 334 of the recess 329 resulting in an increased frictional engagement between the drawstring 336 and the comfort member 184. The lumbar assembly 186 is then aligned with the assembly of the cover assembly 300, the cushion member 252 and the comfort member 184 such that the body portion 272 of the lumbar assembly 186 is located near the midsection 312 of the cover assembly 300, and the support portion 210 of the lumbar assembly 186 is coupled with the comfort member 184 as described above. The flap portion 310 is then folded over the lumbar assembly 186, thereby creating the additional pocket 348 (FIG. 18D) having the interior space 350. A distally located edge 352 of the flap portion 310 is attached to the comfort member 184 by a plurality of apertures 354 with the flap portion 310 that receive the hooks 324 therethrough. The distal edge 352 may also be sewn to the rear side 304 of the cover assembly 300. In the illustrated example, the side edges 356 of the flap portion 310 are not attached to the remainder of the cover assembly 300, such that the side edges 356 cooperate with the remainder of the cover assembly 300 to form slots 360 through with the handle portions 251 of the lumbar assembly 186. The second pocket 348 is configured such that the lumbar assembly 186 is vertically adjustable therein. The assembly of the cover assembly 300, the cushion member 252, the comfort member 184, the lumbar assembly 186 and the second portion 123 of the back shell 112 are then attached to the first portion 119 of the back shell 112. Specifically, the comfort member 184 and the second portion 123 of the back shell 112 are removed from the associated fixture (301), and the comfort member 184 is then attached to the first portion of the back shell via the hooks 124 and box-shaped couplers 196 as previously described. The second portion 123 of the back shell 112 is then rotated about the first portion 119 of the back shell 112 from a position where the second portion 123 is generally planar with the first portion 119, as shown in FIG. 18D, to a position where the second portion 123 is wrapped about the first portion 119 and is generally parallel therewith, as shown in FIG. 8. As best illustrated in FIGS. 11 and 20A, the second portion 123 includes a plurality of rearwardly-extending T-shaped couplers 321, while the first portion includes a plurality of cooperating slots 323 that releasably received the couplers 321 therein, thereby securing the second portion 123 in the second position. Proper alignment of the second portion 123 with the first portion 119 is provided via generally conically-shaped locators 351 (FIG. 20A) extending forwardly from the second portion 123 that locate and align with corresponding conically-shaped recesses 355 (FIG. 24) extending into the rear surface of the first portion 119 of the back shell 112. As best illustrated in FIGS. 22 and 23, the back assembly 18 is further configured to increase the comfort of the outer edges of the back support assembly 99 and improve the aesthetics thereof. Specifically, the flexibly resilient comfort member 184 includes a recessed pocket 400 that receives the cushion member 252 therein, such that the outer edge of the cushion member 252 is spaced inwardly from the outer edge of the comfort member 184, thereby providing an aesthetically clean appearance to the outer peripheral edge of the overall back support assembly 99. As noted above, the back assembly 18 (FIG. 4) is reclinable between an upright position E and a reclined position F. During recline, a gap 402 opens between the top frame portion 100 of the frame assembly 98 and the lower edge 127 of the second portion 123 of the back shell 112, as a result of flexure of the back support assembly 99 and pivoting of the back support assembly 99 about the pivot axis 182 in the direction 180. In the illustrated example, a shield member 406 (FIGS. 12 and 24) prevents access to the gap 402, thereby reducing or eliminating a potential pinch-point for the user. The shield member 406 includes a body portion 408 secured to a rear surface of the first portion 119 of the back shell 112 by a plurality of screws 410 received within rearwardly-extending bosses 412 of the shield member 406. The shield member 406 further includes an arcuately-shaped, downwardly concave engagement portion 414 that slidably tracks along the horizontal portion 100 of the frame assembly 98 and the center portion 158 of the race member 144 as the back assembly 18 is reclined and the back support assembly is flexed. A chair assembly embodiment is illustrated in a variety of views, including a perspective view (FIG. 25), a front elevational view (FIG. 26), a first side elevational view (FIG. 27), a second side elevational view (FIG. 28), a rear elevational view (FIG. 29), a top plan view (FIG. 30), and a bottom plan view (FIG. 31).
