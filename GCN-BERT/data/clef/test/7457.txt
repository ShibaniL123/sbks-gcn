Example 6: Synthesis of racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.mono-(±)-10-camphorsulfonate
2-propanol solution (18.00 g) containing racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine (3.00 g:23.8 mmol) was charged into a 50 mL-flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a cooling line, and 2-propanol solution (15.51 g) containing (±)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (5.52 g: 23.8 mmol) was added thereto while stirring at room temperature. Precipitated crystals were filtered, and then dried under reduced pressure at 60° C., to obtain racemic 3-aminoquinuclidine.mono-(±)-10-camphorsulfonate (6.63 g: 18.5 mmol, yield=78%) as a white crystal.
Endothermic peak top temperature in DSC: 168° C., 195° C.
