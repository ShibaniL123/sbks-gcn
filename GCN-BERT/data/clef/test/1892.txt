7-(Cyclohexylmethyl)-3-methyl-1-(4-(3-methylisoxazol-5-yl)butyl)-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione
Step 1
7-(Cyclohexylmethyl)-3-methyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione
3-Methyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (2.00 g, 12.0 mmol) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (15 mL), sodium hydride (530 mg, 13.2 mmol, 60%) was slowly added at 0째C. The reaction was warmed to 80째C and stirred for 30 minutes, and then (bromomethyl) cyclohexane (2.34 g, 13.2 mmol) was slowly added under nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction solution was stirred at 80째C for 12 hours, and then cooled to 25째C. The reaction solution was filtered after adding water (150 mL), and the filter cake was rinsed with water (10 mL x 2). The solid was dried under reduced pressure by oil pump to give 7-(cyclohexylmethyl)-3-methyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dione (2.8 g, as a yellow solid) with a yield of 89%.
