CROSS REFERENCE This application claims the benefits of Japanese Patent application No.2014-042886 filed on March 5, 2014, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a radiation-curable silicone composition which provides an article having releasing properties. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There are various methods for curing a silicone composition, including a condensation reaction catalyzed by organic metal compounds, a vulcanization catalyzed by organic peroxides and a hydrosilylation catalyzed by platinum group metal catalysts. However, these curing methods need heating. It is desired to improve productivity and to save energy whereby curing takes place at room temperature. In recent years, curing with radiation draws attention as a method for providing an energy for curing without heating. This curing method includes polymerization of acrylic compounds by a radical polymerization, and an ene-thiol reaction. Particularly, a cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane which is cured via a ring-opening reaction of epoxy group with generation of an acid does not receive inhibition of its curing by oxygen, and a cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane is convenient and has good handling property, so that the applications are expanding. Further, the cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane does not need heat for a curing reaction and, therefore, can be applied on film substrates which have poor heat resistance. Therefore, the cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane is used as a backside-treating agent of adhesive tapes, a coating agent for release paper for adhesive labels and a coating agent for fixing fastener tapes. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Sho 50-151997 and Japanese Patent Nos. 2623426, 3384268 and 3993533 describe compositions comprising an epoxy group-containing cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane and a photoacid generator which causes generation of acid by radiation, as a composition which cures by cation polymerization. Further, cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxanes are used as a releasing agent for adhesive tapes of sanitary supplies such as sanitary napkins and disposable diapers. The sanitary napkin and the disposable diaper are individually packaged in view of usability and sanitation. Particularly, an individual packaging film for a sanitary napkin has a film, such as a polyethylene film, which is provided with a releasing agent. The film provided with a releasing agent is attached on an adhesive layer of a main body of the napkin, which adhesive layer fixes the napkin on underwear and, then, the napkin is wrapped and packaged. The radiation-curable silicone composition is often used as the releasing agent. Japanese Patent No. 2987524 describes an invention for a sanitary napkin and a sheet for individually packaging a sanitary napkin wherein a release agent layer is formed on one side of a base material. The aforesaid release agent layer is obtained by curing a release agent mainly comprising an epoxy-functional polyorganosiloxane with ultraviolet irradiation, and the epoxy-functional polyorganosiloxane has 1 to 20 mole % of a monovalent epoxy-functional organic group, relative to the total mole of the organic groups. Even if this sheet for individually packaging sanitary napkins is exposed to a light source such as the sun or a fluorescent before being used, the force needed for releasing the sheet from the adhesive layer does not increase, and the sheet can be easily peeled from the napkin when it is used. Japanese Patent No. 3638850 describes a sheet having a high antistick effect against dirt, wherein a layer of a first silicone compound is formed on a surface of a base sheet, and a layer of a second silicone compound whose surface tension is lower than that of the first silicone compound is further formed on the surface of the layer of the first silicone compound. Thus, this sheet is coated with the two silicone compounds which have different surface tensions to form a sheet having a multi-layer construction and a high antistick effect against dirt. The sanitary napkin is often provided with a smell via a perfume, but customers diversify in recent years and, therefore, a request for an odorless sanitary napkin is increasing. Therefore, a main part of the napkin and an adhesive layer are needed to be odorless and, further, an individual packaging film provided with a releasing agent, which is released before using the main part of the napkin, is also needed to be odorless because the individual packaging film is also touched by a customer. When a composition comprising a cation-polymerizable oraganopolysiloxane and a photoacid generator is used as a radiation-curable silicone composition to form a cured product, odor of an epoxy group as the cation-polymerizable group and odor of a photoacid generator as a curing catalyst tend to remain a little. However, none of the aforesaid patent literature mention odor of the silicone layer. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Hei 11-104166 describes a releasing film for individual packaging of sanitary goods, wherein at least one surface of a synthetic resin film is release treated and an adhesive surface is exposed in air. The releasing layer is composed of a releasing agent made by curing a photo-curing composition containing an epoxy-modified silicone and an optical cation-polymerization initiator. In this film, odor is avoided by the use of the cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane in the releasing agent. However, the cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane is not specified and, therefore, odor of an epoxy group and odor of a photoacid generator are not completely prevented. Decrease of odor from the film is not sufficient. Thus, almost no invention is known for the decrease of odor of a releasing layer of an individual packaging of a sanitary napkin. Regarding an invention for decreasing odor of a cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane composition, Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. Hei 6-49848 describes an ultraviolet-curable organopolysiloxane release coating composition which is substantially odorless. The composition comprises (A) a poly (epoxy haloaryl alkyl siloxane) selected from the group consisting of (i) an epoxy haloaryl alkyl siloxane consisting essentially of approximately 20 to 100 condensation siloxy units selected from diorganosiloxy units represented by (R)2SiO, epoxyorganosiloxy units represented by RR1SiO and haloaryl alkyl siloxy units represented by RR2SiO, and (ii) a blend of the component (i) and an epoxy siloxane consisting essentially of approximately 20 to 100 condensation siloxy units selected from approximately 88 to 99 mole % of diorganosiloxy units and approximately 5 to 12 mole % of epoxy organosiloxy units, and component (i) or (ii) is present in an amount enough to provide approximately 76 to 94 mole % of diorganosiloxy units, approximately 5 to 12 mole % of epoxyorganosiloxy units and approximately 1 to 12 mole % of haloaryl alkylsiloxy units, and(B) an effective amount of a polyaryl onium hexafluorometalloid salt selected from a diarylidonium salt and a triarylsulfonium salt. An epoxy group-containing organopolysiloxane having a monovalent phenol group is known as a release-adjusting agent. It was confirmed that the epoxy group-containing organopolysiloxane had odor of allylphenol remaining in the siloxanes. Patent Literature 8 describes that odor is prevented by the use of a compound having a methyl-chlorophenyl ethyl siloxy unit and a methylepoxy cyclohexyl siloxy unit as the release-adjusting agent. Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. Hei 6-17447 describes a method for providing a controlled releasing property on paper or a plastic substrate. This method comprises the steps of (A) paper or a plastic substrate is treated with an ultraviolet-curable epoxy silicone mixture, and(B) the treated substrate is subjected to curing with ultraviolet to form a tack-free adhesive film having no stain, wherein the ultraviolet-curable epoxy silicone mixture comprises(C) 100 parts by weight of an epoxy silicone comprising 5 to 12 mole % of condensation epoxy organo siloxy units, based on total moles of the condensation diorganosiloxy units(D) an effective amount of a photosensitive polyaryl onium hexafluorometalloid salt, and(E) 0.1 to 50 parts by weight of one kind of a specific additive selected from the group consisting of (i) alkyl phenols having 8 to 20 carbon atoms and (ii) phenol alkyl-substituted organodisiloxanes. Japanese Patent No. 5081826 describes a method for preparing a silicone release coating on a base material. The method comprises (a) a step of preparing a silicone coating composition which cross-links and/or polymerizes with irradiation of short wave ultraviolet (UV-C) having a wavelength in the range of 200 and 280 nm;(b) a step of coating a base material with the aforesaid silicone coating composition; and(c) a step of irradiating the aforesaid base material coated with the aforesaid silicone coating composition with at least one low-pressure lamp which emits false monochromatic light in the aforesaid UV-C region to polymerize the composition, wherein the aforesaid composition comprises (A) at least one of liquid polyorganosiloxane monomer, oligomer and/or polymer A, which have a viscosity of approximately 10 to 10000 mPaÂ·s at 25 degrees C and comprises at least one functional group, Fa, which cross-links and/or polymerizes via a cation route, and(B) an effective amount of a cationic photoinitiator or a radical photoinitiator, which are active under the aforesaid UV-C radiation, wherein the functional group, Fa, is selected from the group consisting of epoxy, oxetane and dioxisoran functional groups. PRIOR LITERATURE Patent Literature 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Sho 50-151997 Patent Literature 2: Japanese Patent No. 2623426 Patent Literature 3: Japanese Patent No. 3384268 Patent Literature 4: Japanese Patent No. 3993533 Patent Literature 5: Japanese Patent No. 2987524 Patent Literature 6: Japanese Patent No. 3638850 Patent Literature 7: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Hei 11-104166 Patent Literature 8: Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. Hei 6-49848 Patent Literature 9: Japanese Examined Patent Publication No. Hei 6-17447 Patent Literature 10: Japanese Patent No. 5081826 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION However, chlorostylene which has odor is used in the synthesis of the release adjusting agent described in Patent Literature 8. Chlorostylene has a boiling point of approximately 200 degrees C and tends to remain in the composition. Further, Patent Literature 8 does not mention decrease of odor of the epoxy group-containing organopolysiloxane itself and odor of the photoacid generator and there is a need to make a composition odorless. The alkylphenol having 8 to 20 carbon atoms used as (i) the additive, i.e. the release adjusting agent, described in Patent Literature 9 has odor of a phenol. Therefore, there is a need to make a composition odorless. Further, nonylphenol which is one of the alkylphenols is designated as a chemical material which is suspected to have an endocrine disruption action by the Ministry of the Environment. Thus, compositions comprising alkylphenol have a problem of safety. Further, Patent Literature 9 describes that the phenol alkyl-substituted organodisiloxane (ii) is purified by distillation to remove the raw material allylphenol which causes odor, so that, odor is prevented. This method is effective to decrease odor of release adjusting agent. However, Patent Literature 9 does not mention the decrease of the odor of the epoxy group-containing organopolysiloxane as a base polymer nor decrease of the odor of the photoacid generator. Therefore, a need to make a composition odorless remains. Patent Literature 10 describes that when use is made of a short wave ultraviolet (UV-C) having wavelength in a range of 200 and 280 nm of a low-pressure lamp, the cured coating obtained is odorless. However, high-pressure lamps are mostly used as a source for curing a cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane. Accordingly, the effect in Patent Literature 10 is not fully attained. Further, Patent Literature 10 does not mention the decrease of odor of the cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane and odor of the photoacid generator. One of the purposes of the present invention is to provide a radiation-curable silicone composition which provides a cured product whose odor is decreased, particularly which is odorless, and which has excellent curability and releasing properties. MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS The inventors have found that a composition comprising an epoxy group-containing cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane which is accompanied by a compound volatilizing during heating at 105 degrees C for 3 hours and wherein the content of the compound is lower than a specific amount, and an iodonium salt having a monovalent aromatic hydrocarbon group having specific carbon atoms in a cation moiety provide a cured product whose odor is decreased and solves the aforesaid problems. Thus, the present invention provides a radiation-curable silicone composition comprising the following components (A) and (B) : (A) an epoxy group-containing cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane which is represented by the following average composition formula (1): R1aR2bSiO(4-a-b)/2 (1) wherein R1 is, independently of each other, an epoxy group-containing monovalent organic group, R2 is, independently of each other, a substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a > 0, b > 0 and the total of a and b is in the range of larger than 0 and at most 3, and(B) an iodonium salt having a cation moiety represented by the following general formula (2) in an effective amount to cure said component (A), [(R3)-I-(R3) ]+ (2) wherein R3 is, independently of each other, a substituted or unsubstituted monovalent aromatic hydrocarbon group having 15 to 26 carbon atoms, wherein said component (A) may be accompanied by any other compounds volatilizing during heating at 105 degrees C for 3 hours, the content of said compounds is at most 2.0 mass %, based on the total amount of component (A) and said compound. Further, the present invention provides an article having a substrate, which has on its surface a cured product obtained by curing the aforesaid radiation-curable silicone composition, so that the surface has good releasing properties. In the present invention, an article having a releasing property means that a substrate of the article has a cured product having releasing property on its surface. A releasing property means that a substrate is separated from an adhesive with no remaining additive. In the present invention, a releasing property includes a release with less force and a release with strong force. The release with less force means that the force needed for releasing the substrate from the adhesive material is small and the release with strong force means that the force needed for releasing the substrate from the adhesive material is large. EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION The odor of an epoxy group-containing organopolysiloxane and the odor of a photoacid generator are prevented in the present radiation-curable silicone composition. Therefore, the present radiation-curable silicone composition provides a cured silicone product whose odor is decreased, particularly which is odorless, and which has excellent curability and releasing properties. The present radiation-curable silicone composition may provide cured products with various releasing properties such as a release with strong force and a release with less force. The force needed is that for releasing the cured product from an adhesive. Accordingly, the present silicone composition is usable for preparing articles with various releasing properties. BEST MODE OF THE INVENTION The present invention will be described below in detail. (A) Epoxy group-containing cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane The epoxy group-containing cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane may be prepared, for instance, by a hydrosilylation of a hydrogen organopolysiloxane and an alkenyl group-containing epoxy compound in the presence of a metal catalyst, as described in Japanese Patent Nos. 3384268 and 3993533. In the hydrosilylation, a solvent and volatile compounds are removed by vacuum distillation under heating. However, the unreacted starting alkenyl group-containing epoxy compound, and a compound formed by a reaction of a low molecular weight siloxane present in the starting hydrogenorganopolysiloxane with the alkenyl group-containing epoxy compound tend to remain in the cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane obtained. Such compounds, i.e. volatile low molecular weight compounds, would be a cause of odor in the cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane. The present invention is characterized in that the amount of compounds volatilizing during heating at 105 degrees C for 3 hours, by which component (A) is accompanied, is at most 2.0 mass %, preferably at most 1.8 mass %, more preferably at most 1.5 mass %, based on the total amount of said compounds and component (A). The amount of the compounds volatilizing during heating at 105 degrees C for 3 hours is close to the amount of odor components contained in the cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane. Therefore, odor of a cured product is decreased by lowering the amount of the compounds volatilizing during heating at 105 degrees C for 3 hours to the aforesaid range. Examples of the compounds volatilizing during heating at 105 degrees C for 3 hours include a low molecular weight organopolysiloxane having an epoxy group. The low molecular weight organopolysiloxane here has a degree of polymerization which is 8 or lower, particularly 7 or lower, and may be a linear, branched or cyclic. Further, the staring alkenyl group-containing epoxy compound is also an example. There is no lower limit for the amount of the volatile compounds. A smaller amount gives a less odorous product. If the amount of the volatile compounds is larger than the upper limit, the volatile compounds cause much odor and an odorless product cannot be obtained. The amount of the compounds volatilizing during heating at 105 degrees C for 3 hours, by which the epoxy group-containing cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane is accompanied, is determined with an air-blowing thermostat oven. Specifically, 2 grams of the epoxy group-containing cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane (hereinafter referred to as "sample") is put into a 50-millilitre beaker and then, the beaker is left in an air-blowing thermostat oven which is set at 105 degrees C. After 3 hours, the beaker is taken out, cooled in a desiccator and, then, weighed to record the decreased amount of the sample. The mass of the components which volatilized during heating is calculated as a percentage, based on the mass of the sample in the beaker before heating. The air-blowing thermostat oven used in the present invention is DN-610H, ex Yamato Scientific Co., Ltd. The rate of air is 12.3 m3/min, the internal volume of the thermostat oven is 223 liters, the internal dimentions is 620 x 600 x 600 mm, and there are two exits having an inner diameter of 30 mm in the back. The 50-millilitre beaker has a product code 010020-5051A, ex Sibata Scientific Technology Ltd. (HARIO CO., LTD.), with an outer diameter of 46 mm and a height of 61 mm. When the epoxy group-containig cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane is left in the air-blowing thermostat oven, volatile low molecular weight compounds volatilize, which have a boiling point of higher than 105 degrees C, for instance a compound having a boiling point of 200 degrees C. Component (A) is an epoxy group-containig cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane represented by the following average composition formula (1): R1aR2bSiO(4-a-b)/2 (1) wherein R1 is, independently of each other, an epoxy group-containing monovalent organic group, R2 is, independently of each other, a substituted or unsubstituted monovalent hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms, a is larger than 0, b is larger than 0 and the total of a and b is larger than 0 and at most 3. Component (A) is accompanied by components volatilizing during heating at 105 degrees C for 3 hours. The content of the compounds is at most 2.0 mass %, preferably at most 1.8 mass %, more preferably at most 1.5 mass %, based on the total amount of the compounds and component (A). In the average composition formula (1), R1 is, independently of each other, an epoxy group-containing monovalent organic group. Examples of the epoxy group-containing monovalent organic group include a glycidoxyalkyl group, an epoxycyclohexylalkyl group, and an oxiranyl alkyl group, which have 3 to 20 carbon atoms, preferably 3 to 16 carbon atoms, more preferably 4 to 10 carbon atoms. In particular, the groups represented by the following formulas are preferable. In the average composition formula (1), R2 is, independently of each other, an unsubstituted or substituted monovalent hydrocarbon group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms. Examples of R2 include alkyl groups such as a methyl group, an ethyl group, a propyl group, a butyl group, cyclo alkyl groups such as a cyclohexyl group, aryl groups such as a phenyl group and a tolyl group, and those groups where a part or all of their hydrogen atoms are replaced with a hydroxy group, a cyano group or a halogen atom(s), such as a hydroxypropyl group, a cyanoethyl group, a 1-chloropropyl group, and a 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl group. Among these, alkyl groups and aryl groups are preferable in view of the releasing property of the cured product. Further, 80 mole % or more of the total mole of R2 groups is preferably a methyl group. In the average composition formula (1), a is larger than 0, b is larger than 0 and the total of a and b is larger than 0 and at most 3. The structure of the organopolysiloxane represented by the aforesaid average composition formula (1) is not limited to any particular one and may be a linear, branched, cyclic or three-dimensional by crosslinked structure. In particular, a linear or branched structure is preferable. The organopolysiloxane may be one kind or a combination of two or more kinds of such. Component (A) has an average epoxy equivalent of 600 to 2,500 g/mol and a viscosity of 5 to 1,000,000 mPaÂ·s. Further preferably, the average epoxy equivalent is 650 to 2,300 g/mol and the viscosity is 10 to 100,000 mPaÂ·s. The viscosity is determined with a rotational viscometer at 25 degrees C. If the average epoxy equivalent is smaller than the aforesaid lower limit, the cured product obtained from the composition may have a release with strong force. Further, the content of the epoxy group is large, so that odor of the epoxy group tends to be strong. If the average epoxy equivalent is larger than the aforesaid upper limit, the odor of the epoxy group is weak, but the curability tends to significantly worsen because of the smaller amount of epoxy group. If the viscosity of component (A) is smaller than the aforesaid lower limit, it may be difficult to apply the composition without a solvent. If the viscosity is larger than the aforesaid upper limit, the viscosity of the composition is too high and it may be difficult to handle the composition. Preferably, component (A) is at least one selected from organopolysiloxanes (A1) to (A3), represented by the following average formula (3), (4) or (5), respectively. Epoxy group-containing cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane (A1): Epoxy group-containing cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane (A2): Epoxy group-containing cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane (A3) : In the average formulas (3) to (5), R1 and R2 are as defined above. c is, independently of each other, a positive number of 2 or larger, d is, independently of each other, 0 or a positive number, and e is a positive number of 2 or larger. Component (A) may be one of or a mixture of two or more of the organopolysiloxanes (A1) to (A3) . The upper limits of c, d and e are not limited to any particular ones. c, d and e are preferably such that the average epoxy equivalent of the oragnopolysiloxanes (A1) to (A3) is 600 to 2,500 g/mol and the viscosity of the oragnopolysiloxanes (A1) to (A3) is 5 to 1,000,000 mPaÂ·s. Further preferred is that the average epoxy equivalent is 650 to 2, 300 g/mol and the viscosity is 10 to 100,000 mPaÂ·s. The viscosity of the organopolysloxane is determined with a rotational viscometer at 25 degrees C. When component (A) is a mixture of two or more of the organopolysiloxanes (A1) to (A3), the aforesaid average epoxy equivalent is an average one of the mixture and the aforesaid viscosity is the viscosity of the mixture. If the average epoxy equivalent is smaller than the aforesaid lower limit, the cured product obtained from the composition may have a release with strong force. Further, the content of the epoxy group is larger, so that odor of the epoxy group tends to be strong. If the average epoxy equivalent is larger than the aforesaid upper limit, the odor of the epoxy group is weak, but the curability tends to significantly worsen because of the smaller amount of epoxy group. If the viscosity is smaller than the aforesaid lower limit, it may be difficult to apply the composition without a solvent. If the viscosity is larger than the aforesaid upper limit, the viscosity of the composition is too high and it may be difficult to handle the composition. The composition (A) may comprise component (A4) represented by the following average formula (6) and component (A5) represented by the following average formula (10) or (11). The weight ratio of component (A4) to component (A5) is 0.1 to 1.5, preferably 0.3 to 1.2. A mixture of components (A4) and (A5) may work as a release adjusting agent, in particular an additive for a release with strong force. Epoxy group-containing cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane (A4) : (R23SiO1/2)f(SiO4/2)g(XO-SiO3/2)h (6) Epoxy group-containing cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane (A5) : R1aR23-aSiO-(R2SiO)r-(R1R2SiO)s-SiR1aR23-a (10) In the average formula (6), R2 is as defined above. f, g, and h are positive numbers satisfying the equation f/(g+h)= 0.5 to 2, preferably f/(g+h) = 0.6 to 1.3. If the value of f/(g+h) is smaller than the aforesaid lower limit, the viscosity of a mixture of components (A4) and (A5) increases and it is difficult to use. If the value of f/(g+h) is larger than the aforesaid upper limit, the effect of attaining a release with strong force is small, which is not preferable. In the average formula (6), X is, independently of each other, a hydrogen atom or a group represented by the following formula (7), (8) or (9). Preferred is that at least one of X is any one of the following formulas (7), (8) and (9), in particuler, the formula (7). -(R22SiO)-(R1R2SiO)i-(R22SiO)z-SiR1kR23-k (7) In the aforesaid formulas (7) to (9), R1 and R2 are as defined above, i, z, m, n and o are, independently of each other, 0 or a positive number, p is a positive number of 1 or larger, provided that the total of i and z is 1 to 50, the total of m and n is 1 to 50, and the total of o and p is 2 to 7, and k and x are, independently of each other, 0, 1, 2 or 3, provided that the total of i and k is 1 or larger and the total of n and x is 1 or larger. Preferably, k and x are, independently of each other, 0 or 1, the total of i and k is 2 or larger, the total of n and x is 2 or larger, p is 2 or larger, the total of i and z is 1 to 40, the total of m and n is 1 to 40, the total of o and p is 2 to 6. If the total of i and k, the total of n and x, or p is smaller than 1, the amount of the epoxy group is smaller and, therefore, the curability of the composition is poor. If the total of i and z, or the total of m and n is smaller than the aforesaid lower limit, it is difficult to synthesize such organopolysiloxane. If the total of i and z, or the total of m and n is larger than the aforesaid upper limit, the viscosity of the mixture becomes too high and it is difficult to handle it. In the average formulas (10) and (11), R1 and R2 are as defined above, r, s, and t are, independently of each other, 0 or a positive number, u is a positive number of 1 or larger, provided that the total of r and s is 3 to 55, the total of t and u is 3 to 8, q is 0, 1, 2 or 3, provided that s and q are not zero at the same time. Preferably, q is 0 or 1, the total of r and s is 3 to 40, and the total of t and u is 3 to 7, provided that s and q are not zero at the same time. If the total of r and s is larger than the aforesaid upper limit, the viscosity of the mixture of components (A4) and (A5) is too high and it is difficult to handle. In the mixture of the cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane (A4) and (A5), the average epoxy equivalent of the organopolysiloxanes is preferably 600 to 2,500g/mol and the viscosity of the mixture is preferably 5 to 1,000,000 mPaÂ·s. Further preferably, the average epoxy equivalent of the mixture is 650 to 2,300 g/mol and the viscosity of the mixture is 10 to 100,000 mPaÂ·s. The viscosity is determined with a rotational viscometer at 25 degrees C. If the average epoxy equivalent is smaller than the aforesaid lower limit, the cured product obtained from the composition may have a release with strong force. Further, the content of the epoxy group is large, so that odor of the epoxy group tends to be strong. If the average epoxy equivalent is larger than the aforesaid upper limit, the odor of the epoxy group is weak, but the curability tends to significantly worsen because of the smaller amount of epoxy group. If the viscosity of mixture is smaller than the aforesaid lower limit, it may be difficult to apply the composition without a solvent. If the viscosity is larger than the aforesaid upper limit, the viscosity of the composition is too high and it may be difficult to handle the composition. In a case where component (A) comprises at least one of components (A1) to (A3) as a base polymer and further comprises a mixture of components (A4) and (A5) as a release adjusting agent, the silicone composition provides a cured product having a release with strong force. That is, the cured product needs a large force to be peeled from an adhesive and, thus, has a large release resistance. When the amount of the mixture of components (A4) and (A5) is larger, the force needed for releasing is larger. In a case where component (A) does not comprise the mixture of components (A4) and (A5), the silicone composition provides a cured product having a release with less force. That is, the cured product can be peeled from an adhesive with a smaller force and, thus, the release resistance is small. Such cured products can be used in release paper. The present silicone composition may provide cured products which have various releasing properties of from a release with strong force to a release with less force, by adjusting the amount of the mixture of components (A4) and (A5) . When the silicone composition comprises the mixture of components (A4) and (A5) as a release adjusting agent, the amount of the mixture is not particularly limited and is preferably 10 to 90 mass %, more preferably 25 to 75 mass %, further preferably 40 to 60 mass %, based on the total mass of component (A). Further, component (A) may be composed only of a mixture of components (A4) and (A5). The present silicone composition may comprise a mixture of the following component (C) which is an organopolysiloxane having no epoxy group and the aforesaid component (A5) or a mixture of the aforesaid components (A4) and (A5) and the component (C) as a release adjusting agent, in place of the aforesaid mixture of components (A4) and (A5). The component (C) is an organopolysiloxane having no epoxy group, represented by the following average formula (6'). (R23SiO1/2)f'(SiO4/2)g'(X'O-SiO3/2)h' (6') In the average formula (6'), R2 is as defined above. X' is, independently of each other, a hydrogen atom or a group represented by the following formula (7'), (8') or (9'). f', g', and h' are positive numbers satisfying the equation f'/(g'+h')= 0.5 to 2, preferably f'/(g'+h')= 0.6 to 1.3. If the value of f'/(g'+h') is smaller than the aforesaid lower limit, the viscosity of the mixture is larger and it is difficult to use. If the value of f'/(g'+h') is larger than the aforesaid upper limit, the effect of giving a release with strong force is smaller, which is not preferable. In the formula (6'), X' is preferably a hydrogen atom. -(R22SiO)-(R22SiO)z'-SiR23 (7') In the formula (7') to (9'), R2 are as defined above, z' is a positive number of 1 to 50, m' is a positive number of 1 to 50, and o' is a positive number of 2 to 7. In a case where the release adjusting agent is a mixture of component (C) and component (A5), the weight ratio of component (C) to component (A5) is 0.1 to 1.5, preferably 0.3 to 1.2. The total amount of components (C) and (A5) is 1 to 100 parts by mass, preferably 10 to 90 parts by mass, more preferably 25 to 75 parts by mass, further preferably 40 to 60 parts by mass, relative to the total 100 parts by mass of components (A) and (C). In a case where the release adjusting agent is a mixture of components (A4) and (A5) and component (C), the weight ratio of components (A4) and (C) to component (A5) is 0.1 to 1.5, preferably 0.3 to 1.2. The total amount of components (A4), (C) and (A5) is 1 to 100 parts by mass, preferably 10 to 90 parts by mass, more preferably 25 to 75 parts by mass, further preferably 40 to 60 parts by mass, relative to the total 100 parts by mass of components (A) and (C) . The ratio of component (A4) to component (C) is not limited to any particular one. A method for making the content of the aforesaid volatile compounds, mass %, to the upper limit or less in the epoxy group containing cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane is not limited to any particular one. For instance, stripping may be used. The stripping conditions may be selected according to the conventional manners so as to making the content, mass %, of the volatile compounds in the organopolysiloxane to less than the upper limit. (B) Photoacid generator Component (B) is an iodonium salt having a cation moiety represented by the following general formula (2). The ionium salt is a photoacid generator and works as a catalyst for curing component (A) with a radiation. Component (B) is charaterized in that R3 in the following general formula (2) is a substituted or unsubstituted, monovalent aromatic hydrocarbon atom having 15 to 26 carbon atoms. [(R3)-I-(R3)]+ (2) In the formula (2), R3 is, independently of each other, a substituted or unsubstituted monovalent aromatic hydrocarbon atom having 15 to 26 carbon atoms, preferably 16 to 24 carbon atoms. Examples of R3 include aromatic hydrocarbon groups such as a nonylphenyl group, a decylphenyl group, an undecylphenyl group, a dodecylphenyl group, a tridecylphenyl group, a tetradecylphenyl group and a pentadecylphenyl group, and those groups where a part or all of their hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms are replaced with a hydroxy group, a cyano group or a halogen atom(s), such as a hydroxypropylphenyl group, a cyanoethylphenyl group, a 1-chloropropylphenyl group, and a 3,3,3-trifluoropropylphenyl group. In particular, a part or all of hydrogen atoms bonded to carbon atoms of the aromatic hydrogen group may be preferably replaced with a linear or branched alkyl group having 9 to 20 carbon atoms. For instance, preferred are a decylphenyl group, an undecylphenyl group, a tridecylphenyl group, a tetradecylphenyl group and a pentadecylphenyl group. If the number of the carbon atoms of R3 is smaller than the aforesaid lower limit, an alkylbenzen iodide and an alkylbenzen, which generate in decomposition of the photoacid generator, volatilize easily and, therefore, odor tends to result from a cured product obtained by curing the silicone composition. If the number of carbon atoms of R3 is larger than the upper limit, no further increased effect of decreasing odor is attained. Regarding the catalyst activity of the photoacid generator, if the number of carbon atoms of R3 is smaller than the lower limit, the activation by radiation absorption is lower, so that the curability of the composition decreases. If the number of carbon atoms of R3 is larger than the upper limit, no further increased activation by radiation absorption is attained. Sulfonium salts are known as a photoacid generator. However, a sulfur atom is liberated from the sulfonium salts in decomposition. Therefore, a cured product obtained has odor of the sulfur atom, so that sulfonium salts are not suitable in the present invention. As mentioned above, component (B) is characterized in that the iodonium salt has the aforesaid cation moiety. An anion moiety may have any moiety as long as the iodonium salt having such moiety works as a photoacid generator. In view of the curability and solubility in the cation-polymerizable organopolysiloxane, preferred anion moieties are selected from the group consisting of SbF6-, [B(C6F5)4]-, [B(C6H4CF3)4]-, [(C6F5)2BF2]-, [C6F5BF3]-, [B(C6H3F2)4]-, [(CF3CF2)3PF3]-, [(CF3CF2CF2)3PF3]-, [((CF3)2CF)3PF3]-, [((CF3)2CF)2PF4]-, [((CF3)2CFCF2)3PF3]- and [((CF3)2CFCF2)2PF4]-. Examples of component (B) include bis(alkyl phenyl) iodonium hexafluoroantimonate, bis(alkyl phenyl) iodonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate and bis(alkyl phenyl) iodonium tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate. The alkyl group is preferably a linear or branched alkyl group having 9 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably 9 to 15 carbon atoms. They may be used alone or a combination of two or more of them. Component (B) may be dissolved in a solvent such as isopropyl alcohol. The amount of component (B) may be an effective amount to work as a photoacid generator. That is, the amount may be enough to cure component (A) with radiation and is not limited particularly. In particular, the amount is preferably 0.05 to 20 parts by mass, more preferably 0.1 to 10 parts by mass, relative to the total 100 parts by mass of component (A) and any other compound volatilizing during heating at 105 degrees C for 3 hours. The present silicone composition is applied on various substrates, then cured with radiation to form a cured film having a release property so as to provide a releasing property on a surface of the substrate. Thus, release paper and release films are prepared. The substrate is not limited to any particular one and the present composition is used on various general purpose substances. Examples of the substrate include glassine paper, clay coated paper, fine paper, polyethylene laminated paper, plastic film, and transparent resins such as polycarbonate. In particular, the present composition is applied on polyethylene films, polypropylene films and polyester films which are to be processed into individual packaging films for sanitary supplies such as sanitary napkins and disposable diapers. The method for applying the present silicone composition on the substrate is not particularly limited. For instance, any known manners such as roll coating, gravure coating, wire doctor coating, air-knife coating and dipping coating may be used. The amount applied may be decided depending on the purpose of use. For instance, the amount applied may be 0.01 to 3.0 g/m2. The coating is easily cured with radiation. The present silicone composition is prepared by mixing the aforesaid components (A) and (B). The silicone composition may further comprise optional materials other than components (A) and (B). Examples of the optional materials include additives such as fillers, antistatic agents, flame retarders, defoaming agents, fluidity modifiers, light stabilizers, solvents, non-reactive resins and radical-curable compounds. The amount of optional components may be according to conventional manners and selected so that the effects of the present invention are not obstructed. The present silicone composition is cured by irradiation of a radiation energy ray. Any radiation energy ray which has an energy enough to induce decomposition of the photoacid generator (B) may be used. Preferred are such emitted by a high-pressure or ultra-high-pressure mercury lamp, a metal halide lamp, a xenon lamp, a carbon ark lamp, a fluorescent, a semiconductor or solid-state laser, an argon laser, He-Cd laser, KrF excimer laser, ArF excimer laser and F2 laser. Preferred is an energy ray in the range of from ultraviolet to visible light of approximate 100 to 800 nm. In particular, a radiation source having a strong light intensity in a region of 200 and 400 nm is preferable. Alternatively, a radiation having a high energy such as an electron ray and an X-ray may be used. The time for irradiation of the radiation energy may be usually 0.1 to 10 seconds at room temperature. When transmittance of the energy ray is low or the coating obtained from the silicone composition is thick, the irradiation time may be longer than the aforesaid time. If needed, after the irradiation with the energy ray, the silicone composition may be heated at room temperature to 150 degrees C for a few seconds to a few hours to after cure. An energy of 5 to 500 mJ/cm2 of a radiation of a wavelength of 254 nm is effective, preferably 10 to 450 mJ/cm2, further preferably 15 to 400 mJ/cm2. If the amount of energy is smaller than the aforesaid lower limit, the silicone composition is not cured sufficiently. If the amount of the energy is larger than the aforesaid upper limit, no further increased curability is confirmed.
