Step 4: N-[5-Diethylamino-2-(5-ethylthio-[1,3,4]-thiadiazol-2-ylazo)-phenyl]-acrylamide (Magenta 14)
3-Chloro-N-[5-diethylamino-2-(5-ethylthio-[1,2,4]-thiadiazolyl-2-ylazo)-phenyl]-propionamide (6.1 g, 0.0143 mol) is stirred in dichloromethane (60 ml) at ambient temperature and triethylamine (3.1 g, 0.308 mol) are added drop wise. The solution is stirred overnight, extracted with water (75 ml), dried (MgSO4) and evaporated to dryness. Recrystallisation from methylene chloride/methylated spirit yields N-[5-diethylamino-2-(5-ethylthio-[1,3,4]-thiadiazol-2-ylazo)-phenyl]-acrylamide (Magenta 14) as crimson needles (5.1 g, 91%), λmax (EtOAc) 518 nm, ∈max 59,000, ½ band width 78 nm.
