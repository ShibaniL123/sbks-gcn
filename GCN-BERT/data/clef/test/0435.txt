FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present application relates to a linear cutting stapler, which belongs to the technical field of medical instruments. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Linear cutting staplers are widely used in surgical operations for wound closure, and internal tissue closure and excision. A typical linear cutting stapler as disclosed in U.S. patent No. 5,129,570 performs two functions of stapling and cutting, to remove the redundant tissue while stapling the wound. This kind of linear cutting stapler generally includes two jaws (i.e., an upper jaw and a lower jaw), a closing handle for closing the upper jaw and the lower jaw, a staple anvil and a staple cartridge arranged opposite to each other at the front ends of the upper jaw and lower jaw respectively, a firing piece and a cutter which are arranged in the staple cartridge and are moveable synchronously relative to the staple cartridge, and a push button for driving movement of the firing piece and the cutter. Staples are arranged in the staple cartridge. The firing piece pushes a staple pusher successively and pushes the staples towards the staple anvil. The cutter cuts off the tissue between the staple cartridge and the staple anvil. The staple cartridge of the instrument can be used for multiple times by being replaced. In clinical application, multiple times of stapling and cutting tissues are often required, and thus the staple cartridge is required to be replaced for many times in an operation. When no staple cartridge is loaded, the push button can be pushed forwards arbitrarily, and then the cutter may be pushed out. This may cause serious consequence as arising from only cutting without stapling. Accordingly, a safety mechanism is provided in the linear cutting staplers in the prior art. The U.S. patent No. 5,129,570 discloses a safety mechanism, in which a safety block with a cutter passage and a staple pushing bar passage is provided in the middle portion of the instrument, and a leaf spring is provided under the cutter. When the instrument is in an opened position, i.e., the upper jaw and the lower jaw are not closed, the leaf spring lifts the cutter upwards, so that the cutter cannot pass through the cutter passage, thereby playing the role of safety. After the staple cartridge is loaded in the instrument, and the two upper and lower jaws are closed, the staple cartridge forces the top portion of the cutter, so that the cutter overcomes the elastic force of the leaf spring and returns to be in alignment with the cutter passage. At this moment, the safety mechanism is deactivated and the instrument can be fired for using. The U.S. patent No. 7,055,730 discloses another safety mechanism, in which a safety block with a cutter pushing bar passage and a staple pushing bar passage is provided in the middle portion of the instrument, with the safety block being rotatable around the instrument under the action of the torsion spring. When the instrument is in an opened position, i.e., the upper jaw and the lower jaw are not closed, the safety block twists such that neither the staple pushing bar nor the cutter pushing bar are allowed to pass through their passages, thereby playing the role of safety. After the staple cartridge is loaded in the instrument, and the upper jaw and the lower jaw are closed, the staple cartridge forces the safety block such that the safety block overcomes the elastic force of the torsion spring and returns into the normal position. That is, the staple pushing bar and the cutter pushing bar align with their own passages on the safety block respectively, so that both the staple pushing bar and the cutter pushing bar are allowed to pass through the safety block. At this moment, the safety mechanism is deactivated and the instrument can be fired for using. The application US 2005/222616 A1 discloses a surgical fastener applying apparatus for sequentially applying a plurality of surgical fasteners to body tissue. The surgical fastener applying apparatus includes a loading and lockout mechanism 50 for a cartridge assembly 16, and the loading and lockout mechanism 50 includes a rocker 52 which is pivotably mounted to a channel frame 12a of a cartridge receiving half-section 12 by way of transversely extending post portions 52a seating in openings formed through the sidewalls of the channel frame 12a, thus the rocker 52 may rotate around the post portions 52a. The rocker in the loading and lockout mechanism is a complicated component including the post portions 52a, the block surface 52e, and the rocker body, which is not easy to be manufactured and easy to be damaged. All of the above structures are complicated, and difficult to be manufactured and assembled, as well as costly. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present application is to provide a linear cutting stapler having a safety mechanism with simple structure. The object of the present application will be implemented by the following technical solutions. A linear cutting stapler is provided, including an upper jaw and a lower jaw capable of being closed or opened relative to each other, a staple cartridge being provided at a distal end of the lower jaw. The lower jaw has a U shape provided slidably with a firing piece and a cutter pushing bar. The linear cutting stapler further includes a safety mechanism including a safety member and an opening. The opening is arranged on the firing piece and used to receive the safety member. Mounting or removing of the staple cartridge may drive the safety member to move in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the lower jaw, so as to enable the safety member to be disengaged from or engaged with the opening of the firing piece. Further, the safety member is a stop block including an engaging portion, and the outer profile of the engaging portion is identical to the inner profile of the opening of the firing piece. Further, the stop block further includes a welding portion for being driven by the staple cartridge. Further, the welding portion and the engaging portion are arranged at both sides of the stop block, respectively. Further, the top surface of the welding portion is higher than that of the engaging portion. Further, the welding portion is fixedly connected to the top surface of a leaf spring. The bottom surface of the leaf spring is fixed to the inner bottom surface of the lower jaw. The axis of the leaf spring intersects that of the lower jaw such that the bottom surface of the welding portion is higher than the bottom surface of the leaf spring. Further, the leaf spring is fixed to both the stop block and the lower jaw by welding. Further, the inner bottom surface of the lower jaw is provided thereon with a spacer including an elongated slot. The leaf spring passes through the elongated slot. The present application has main beneficial effects such as a simple structure, easy to be manufactured, safe and reliable, as well as good promotion value.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As shown in Figures 1 to 3, the present application provides a safety mechanism for a linear cutting stapler. Similar to the prior art, the linear cutting stapler includes a plastic shell, and an upper jaw and a lower jaw capable of being closed or opened relative to each other. A staple anvil (not shown) is provided at a distal end of the upper jaw, and a staple cartridge 2 is provided at a distal end of the lower jaw 1. Of course, the positions of the upper jaw and the lower jaw may be interchanged, and such a definition in the present application is only for the purpose of clarity. The lower jaw 1 is in a U shape. A firing piece 5 and a cutter pushing bar (not shown) respectively for firing the staple pusher and cutting a tissue are slidably provided at a distal end of the lower jaw 1. In use, the tissue is placed between the staple anvil and the staple cartridge; then, the upper and lower jaws are moved towards each other to close the handle so as to enable the upper and lower jaws to clamp the tissue; and then, the firing push button arranged at the proximal ends of the upper and lower jaws is pushed to staple or cut the tissue. The present application provides the linear cutting stapler including a safety mechanism. The safety mechanism includes a safety member and an opening 52 arranged on the firing piece 5 to receive the safety member. The opening 52 is close to the firing end 51 of the firing piece 5. In the present preferred embodiment, the safety member is a stop block 4 including an engaging portion 41. The outer profile of the engaging portion 41 is identical to the inner profile of the opening 52 of the firing piece 5. The mounting or removing of the staple cartridge 2 may drive the stop block 4 to move in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the lower jaw 1, so as to cause the engaging portion 41 of the stop block 4 to be disengaged from or engaged with the opening 52 of the firing piece 5, thereby achieving the deactivation and activation of the safety mechanism. In junction with Figure 4, the engaging portion 41 is engaged in the opening 52 to limit the movement of the firing piece 5 relative to the lower jaw 1. In conjunction with Figure 5, the engaging portion 41 is disengaged from the firing piece 5 after being pressed by the staple cartridge 2. As a result, the firing piece 5 is movable relative to the lower jaw 1. Further, the stop block 4 may further includes a welding portion 42 for being driven by the staple cartridge 2. The welding portion 42 and the engaging portion 41 are respectively arranged at two sides of the stop block 4. That is, in addition to the engaging portion 41, the other end of the stop block 4 may be driven by the staple cartridge 2. Preferably, as shown in Figure 3, the top surface of the welding portion 42 is higher than that of the engaging portion 41. In this way, when the staple cartridge 2 is mounted on the lower jaw 1, the staple cartridge 2 may preferably contact the welding portion 42. Because of the rigidity of the stop block 4, the welding portion 42 may drive the engaging portion 41 to disengage from the opening 52 of the firing piece 5. In the present preferred embodiment, the welding portion 42 is fixedly connected to a top surface 32 of a leaf spring 3. The bottom surface 32 of the leaf spring 3 is fixed to the inner bottom surface 11 of the lower jaw 1. The axis of the leaf spring 3 intersects that of the lower jaw 1. That is, the leaf spring 3 is obliquely arranged in the lower jaw 1, and hence the bottom surface of the welding portion 42 is higher than the bottom surface 31 of the leaf spring 3, so that a height difference is kept between the welding portion 42 and the inner bottom surface 11 of the lower jaw 1 to ensure the moving distance of the stop block 4. Since in some cases, the inner bottom surface 11 of the lower jaw 1 may be provided with a spacer 6 thereon, the spacer 6 is required to include an elongated slot 61 for the leaf spring 3 to pass through. If no spacer 6 is provided, one slot may be arranged at welding joint between the leaf spring and the jaw. The leaf spring is welded on the outer surface of the jaw. Further, in the present preferred embodiment, the leaf spring 3 is fixed to both the stop block 4 and the lower jaw 1 by welding. The instrument according to the present application has simple structure, is easy to be manufactured, safe and reliable, and has good promotion value.
