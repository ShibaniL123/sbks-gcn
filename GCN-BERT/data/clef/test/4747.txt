Step B: 5-Chloro-6-(difluoromethyl)-2-ethyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine. To a solution of 5-chloro-2-ethyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-6-carbaldehyde (217 mg, 1.04 mmol) in DCM (21 mL) at 0° C. under an Na atmosphere was added diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (0.82 mL, 6.21 mmol) dropwise via syringe. The mixture was stirred at rt for 3 h and at 35° C. for 3 h. After cooling to rt, the reaction mixture was poured over ice (ca. 25 mL), diluted with sat. aq. NaHCO3 (30 mL), and extracted with DCM (×2). The combined organics were washed with brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification (FCC, SiO2; 0-100% EtOAc/hexanes) afforded the title compound (193 mg, 80%).
