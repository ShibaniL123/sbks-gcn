FIELD The present disclosure relates to a process for the production of crude bio-oil and its up-gradation to bio-oil using a catalyst composition. DEFINITIONS Biomass The term biomass in the context of the present disclosure means material such as organic waste, urban refuse, wood, agricultural crops or wastes, municipal wastes and the like, which can be used as a source of fuel or energy. Crude Bio-Oil The term crude bio-oil used in the context of the present disclosure means an oil or biofuel derived from biomass before it is refined for use as an alternative to petroleum fuel. BACKGROUND Biomass, a renewable energy source, can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or indirectly after converting it to various forms of biofuels. Biofuels are derived from biomass and are intended to provide an alternative to petroleum fuels. Conversion of biomass to biofuel can be achieved by different methods which are broadly classified into thermal, chemical and biochemical methods. Fossil fuels such as petroleum, natural gas and coal are typically formed through the processes of thermochemical conversion (TCC) from biomass buried beneath the ground. TCC is a chemical reforming process of biomass in a heated and usually pressurized, oxygen deprived enclosure, where long-chain organic compounds break into short-chain hydrocarbons such as syngas or oil. TCC is a broad term that includes gasification, including the Fisher-Tropsch process, direct liquefaction, hydrothermal liquefaction and pyrolysis. Pyrolysis is a heating process of dried biomass to directly produce syngas and/or oil. Both gasification and pyrolysis require dried biomass as feedstock and the processes occur in an environment higher than 600° C. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) is a technology for converting high-moisture waste biomass into energy dense “crude bio-oil” that can be used for direct combustion or refined for transportation grade fuels. HTL, also called hydrous pyrolysis, is a process for the reduction of complex organic materials such as bio-waste or biomass into crude oil and other chemicals. Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) technique, which involves the application of heat and pressure on the biomass medium, has an advantage that the lipids and other organic components can be efficiently converted while the biomass is in wet condition. During HTL, high moisture biomass is subjected to elevated temperature (250-400° C.) and pressure (up to 225 bars) in order to break down and reform the chemical building blocks into crude bio oil. HTL of biomass gives only crude bio oil that needs to be further treated/refined to get finished crude oil products. The hydrothermal process breaks down bio macromolecules in the wet biomass and promotes heteroatom removal. Some of the representative patent documents which suggest conversion of biomass to upgraded bio-oil via crude bio oil are discussed herein below. US20120055077 suggests a method of producing an upgraded bio-oil from a wet biomass which involves heating the wet biomass at a first temperature (200 to 400° C.) and a first pressure (0.1 to 25 MPa) for a time period ranging from 10 to 200 minutes to form a crude bio-oil and heating the crude bio-oil and water at a second temperature and a second pressure for a time period of at least 30 minutes to form the upgraded bio-oil, wherein the second temperature is greater than the first temperature and is at least 300° C. However, the process suggested in US20120055077 has the drawback that it requires stringent reaction conditions to be maintained throughout. As per the procedure suggested in US20120055077, the biomass is subjected to heat twice i.e. heating at a first temperature and at a first pressure followed by heating at a second temperature and at a second pressure. The first temperature and first pressure are below supercritical conditions of water; whereas the second temperature and second pressure are at or near supercritical conditions of water. In the first heating step, the reaction must be controlled in such a manner that at least a portion of the water present in the wet biomass remains in liquid phase throughout the step of heating to form the crude bio-oil. Further, in the second heating step, the crude bio oil is converted into upgraded bio-oil only in the presence of water; the crude bio-oil and water must be heated in such a manner that some water remains In the liquid phase or in a super-critical fluid phase throughout the step of heating to form the upgraded bio-oil. Still further, the catalysts employed in the process suggested by US 20120055077 are heterogeneous catalyst containing Pd/C, Pt/C, Ru/C, Ni/SiO2-Al2O3, sulfided CoMo/γ-Al2O3, zeolite, activated carbon, and combinations thereof. Considering the complexity associated with the suggested process, there is a need for a simple, energy efficient, time saving and high yielding process for the conversion of biomass into crude bio oil and its up-gradation into bio-oil. OBJECTS Some of the objects of the present disclosure, which at least one embodiment herein satisfies, are as follows: It is an object of the present disclosure to provide a process for the production of crude bio oil and its up-gradation to bio-oil using a regenerable and recyclable catalyst. It is another object of the present disclosure to provide a simple, energy efficient, time saving and high yielding process for the production of crude bio oil and its up-gradation to bio-oil.

It is yet another object of the present disclosure to provide a process which is capable of producing bio-oil which is free from heteroatoms such as oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorus. Other objects and advantages of the present disclosure will be more apparent from the following description which is not intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure. SUMMARY The present disclosure relates to a process for the conversion of crude bio oil into bio oil. The crude bio oil is prepared in accordance with the process using the catalyst composition as disclosed in the co-pending patent application 2899MUM2013, to which this patent application is a patent of addition. In accordance with the present disclosure the temperature and pressure parameters for preparing bio oil are similar or slightly higher than that required for the preparation of crude bio oil from crude biomass. Further, the preparation of crude bio oil from crude biomass in accordance with the process of the present disclosure is carried out in the absence of a solvent. The purpose of upgrading the crude bio oil to bio oil is to make the bio oil compatible with the petroleum crude oil. This is achieved by removing heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur by subjecting the crude oil to upgradation process of the present disclosure. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS The disclosure will now be explained in relation to the non-limiting accompanying drawings, in which: FIG. 1—illustrates gas chromatogram of crude bio oil; FIG. 2—illustrates gas chromatogram of bio oil; FIG. 3—illustrates a flowchart for the preparation of crude bio oil; and FIG. 4—illustrates a flowchart for the preparation of bio-oil. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The co-pending patent application No. 2899/MUM/2013 overcomes the drawbacks associated with the known hydrothermal liquefaction methods for conversion of biomass to crude bio oil, such as time consumption, energy consumption and low yield and discloses a simple, energy efficient, time saving and high yielding process for hydrothermal conversion of biomass into bio-crude. The co-pending patent application No. 2899/MUM/2013 particularly provides a method for the preparation of a catalyst at room temperature having improved catalytic activity when used for hydrothermal conversion of biomass into crude bio oil. However, the crude bio oil obtained is incompatible with petroleum crude oil as it contains free fatty acids, N-containing heterocyclic compounds, polycyclic aromatics, unsaturated compounds and other undetectable heavier molecules. To make the crude bio oil compatible with the petroleum crude oil, the crude bio oil needs to be upgraded. The present disclosure focuses on the upgradation of crude bio oil to bio oil. Particularly, the present disclosure provides for up-gradation of crude bio oil to bio-oil in the absence of a solvent, and which is carried out essentially at temperature and pressure conditions similar to those of conversion of biomass to crude bio oil. The process of the present disclosure is simple, efficient and time saving as it does not require temperature & pressure conditions to be maintained near the supercritical conditions of water. The heating of biomass slurry to form crude bio-oil does not require water to be present in liquid phase throughout the reaction. Also, the conversion of crude bio-oil into upgraded bio-oil does not require water, either in liquid phase or in a super-critical fluid phase. Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a process for the production of crude bio oil and its up-gradation to bio-oil. A flowchart for the process of preparing crude bio oil (CBO) is depicted in FIG. 3, and a flowchart for the process of preparing upgraded bio-oil (UBO) is depicted in FIG. 4. The Process Involves the Following Steps In the first step, slurry of a bio-mass is prepared in a medium. The concentration of the biomass in the slurry ranges from 5 to 35 wt %.

The amount of a metal in the catalyst composition ranges from 0.1 to 15 w/w %. Non-limiting examples of the solubilizing agent present in the catalyst composition includes ammonia solution, piperidine, pyrrolidine, morpholine, piperazine hydrate, 2-methylcyclohexyl amine, cyclohexylamine and hexamethyleneimine. Preferably, the solubilizing agent is hexamethyleneimine. The amount of the solubilizing agent in the catalyst composition of the present disclosure ranges from 4 to 50 wt. %. The amount of the support in the first catalyst composition ranges from 30 to 96 wt %. In one embodiment the support is selected from the group consisting of alumina, silica, zirconia, alumina-silica, zeolite and molecular sieves. In another embodiment the support comprises at least one carrier which includes but is not limited to alumina, silica, zirconia alumina-silica, zeolite and molecular sieves in an amount from 30 and 100 wt % with respect to the support and at least one binder which includes but is not limited to aluminophosphate, pseudoboehmite, alumin oxide, silica and ludox silica solution in an amount from 0.001 to 70 wt % with respect to the support. Alternatively, the support contains at least one carrier which includes but is not limited to nano-structured aluminum oxide, nano-structured silicon oxide, nano-structured zirconium oxide, nano-structured cerium oxide, nano-structured titanium oxide, nano-structured tantalum oxide in an amount from 30 and 100 wt % with respect to the support and at least one binder which includes but is not limited to aluminophosphate, pseudoboehmite, alumina oxide, silica and ludox silica solution in an amount from 0.001 to 70 wt % with respect to the support. Still alternatively, the support contains at least one carrier which includes but is not limited to mesoporous zeolites, mesoporous alumino silicate, mesoporous silicalite, mesoporous molecular sieves in an amount from 30 and 100 wt % with respect to the support and at least one binder which includes but is not limited to aluminophosphate, pseudoboehmite, alumina oxide, silica and ludox silica solution in an amount from 0.001 to 70 wt % with respect to the support. The support employed in the catalyst preparation is in the form selected from the group consisting of extrudate, sphere, pellet and powder. The support utilized has a surface area ranging from 25 to 1000 m2/g, whereas the spheres and pellets have a diameter of 3 to 10 mm. In one embodiment the support is in the form of extrudates having lengths ranging from 4 to 6 mm and diameter ranging from 1 to 2 mm. In another embodiment the support is prepared by using at least one carrier, at least one binder and at least one peptizing agent. The peptizing agent is selected from the group consisting of phosphoric acid, acetic acid and combination thereof. In the third step, the mixture is heated at a temperature ranging from 200 to 350° C. and at a pressure ranging from 70 to 250 bars for a time period ranging from 10 to 180 minutes to obtain a mass containing crude bio oil, a residue and the catalyst. Optionally, the mixture is heated in the presence of at least one hydrogen source selected from the group consisting of H2 and CH4. In one embodiment, hydrogen gas is fed at an initial pressure ranging from 30-50 bars. During the reaction, the vessel pressure increases to lie in the range of 70-250 bars, depending upon the water vapor pressure and other process conditions. During the course of heating the biomass breaks down and reforms the chemical building blocks into crude bio oil. The catalyst hydrothermal process employing the catalyst of the present disclosure breaks down the bio macromolecules present in the biomass and promotes removal of heteroatoms to result into crude bio oil. The crude bio oil obtained contains free fatty acids, N-containing heterocyclic compounds, polycyclic aromatics, unsaturated compounds and other undetected heavier molecules and therefore, is not suitable for application. FIG. 1 illustrates a gas chromatogram of crude bio-oil showing the presence of more than 25 compounds in the crude bio-oil. To make the crude bio oil suitable for applications it is upgraded to bio oil by subjecting crude bio oil to reduction process. The crude bio oil, before subjecting to the reduction process is separated from the mass to obtain separated crude bio oil and a sludge containing the residue and the first catalyst. The crude bio oil is extracted by using at least one solvent and then the solvent is evaporated to obtain solvent free crude bio oil. Simultaneously, the first catalyst is recovered from the sludge. The recovery of the catalyst comprises the steps of separating the catalyst from said residue, calcining at a temperature of 500 to 700° C. for a time period of 3 to 7 hours followed by reduction using hydrogen at a temperature of 400 to 600° C. for a time period of 2 to 5 hours to obtain a recovered catalyst. The recovered catalyst can be recycled for the production of crude bio oil or bio-oil or both. Finally, the solvent free crude bio oil is subjected to reaction in the presence of a second catalyst composition and hydrogen source at a temperature ranging from 200 to 450° C. and at a pressure ranging from 70 to 250 bars for a time period ranging from 10 to 180 minutes to obtain upgraded bio-oil, a residue, the second catalyst. The second catalyst employed for reduction of crude bio oil to obtain upgraded bio-oil is a fresh catalyst having the same composition as that of the first catalyst or a recovered catalyst from the sludge. In one embodiment, hydrogen gas is fed at an initial pressure ranging from 30-50 bars. During the reaction, the vessel pressure increases to lie in the range of 70-250 bars, depending upon the input hydrogen gas and the formed gaseous hydrocarbons. The catalyst employed for the production of crude bio oil and up-gradation of the crude bio oil to bio-oil is characterized by: i. total acid strength ranging from 0.05 to 3.5 mmole/gm of ammonia; andii. pore width ranging from 1 to 20 nm. The yield of the crude bio oil obtained by the process of the present disclosure using the catalyst composition as specified above ranges from 45% to 80% and the carbon content of said crude bio oil ranges from 74 to 80%. The yield of the bio-oil obtained by the process of the present disclosure using the catalyst composition as specified above ranges from 50 to 70%. The catalyst compositions of the present disclosure are highly stable during hydrothermal liquefaction. Further, the recovered catalyst of the present disclosure exhibits X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern similar to the fresh catalyst reflecting the retention of crystalline structure of the catalyst after regeneration. The Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area, metal concentration and decomposition behavior of the regenerated catalysts are similar to that of fresh catalysts showing that the texture of the catalysts is retained during regeneration of the catalyst. Still further, the recovered catalyst can be recycled for at least 5 times with a performance similar to the fresh catalyst.

Whereas, the % HTL oil yield using the commercial catalyst (which is devoid of a solubilizing agent) ranges from 48 to 68%. It is particularly found that when a catalyst comprising hexamethyleneimine as a solubilizing agent is utilized for liquefaction of high lipid Nannochloropsis algae, % HTL oil yield is 69 to 73%. Thus, when hexamethyleneimine is used as a solubilizing agent, the process of the present disclosure provides high yield of crude bio oil than the crude bio oil yield obtained by the process which utilize commercial catalyst.
