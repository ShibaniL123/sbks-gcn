CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/993,997, filed on May 15, 2014, which is incorporated herein by reference. TECHNICAL FIELD The present disclosure relates to footrests. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to portable, inflatable toilet footrests for use while sitting on a toilet. BACKGROUND Humans can perform defecation in different postures; the two most common are squatting or sitting positions. The squatting posture is usually used when using a squat toilet (mainly a feature of the developing world), or when toilets are unavailable. The sitting posture during defecation is a standard posture seen in the western world because western-style toilets usually require a sitting position with the back erect and the knees away from the chest in about a ninety-degree angle. The anorectal angle, which is the angle formed in the colon where the puborectalis muscle wraps around the rectum, is a very important factor in maintaining continence. The sitting posture common to western-style toilets causes a narrowing of the anorectal angle and prevents the puborectalis muscle from relaxing, which may cause difficulty in emptying the bowels. Additionally, the sitting position may cause the person to repeat the Valsalva maneuver, i.e., exhalation against a closed airway to increase internal pressure, holding his breath to increase internal pressure, which can lead to syncope. A sitting posture may increase issues related to weakness in the colon wall because of the increased straining needed to defecate. In contrast, the squatting defecation posture involves squatting by standing with the knees and hips sharply bent and the buttocks suspended near the ground. By using the squatting defecation posture, the anorectal angle is increased which allows the puborectalis muscle to fully relax which aids defecation by reducing the amount of effort needed to empty the bowels. The advantages of the squatting position may be obtained when using western-style toilets in conjunction with an inflatable toilet footrest. Footrests help raise the knees toward the chest and help to lessen the normal sitting angle of about ninety-degrees to much less. As the feet are raised, the puborectalis muscle relaxes, the colon aligns allowing gravity to aid evacuation, and the required expulsive effort lessens. As such, several footrests exist in the art that are aimed at allowing a human to achieve a better anorectal angle while sitting on a toilet. However, it is often unpractical for a user to take a toilet stool while traveling due to the size and/or weight of the toilet stool. As such, there remains a need for a toilet stool that is easily transportable so that a user may travel (e.g., vacation) with a toilet stool and that is compact for easy storage, and that can adjust to different heights. The present invention seeks to solve these and other problems. SUMMARY OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS The present disclosure is directed to inflatable toilet footrests while using a toilet. In one embodiment, an inflatable toilet footrest comprises a foot surface having a back concave curvature sized so as to conform to a toilet, a sidewall extending downwardly from the foot surface creating an airtight seal with the foot surface, a bottom portion connected to and creating an airtight seal with the sidewall, and an air valve. In another embodiment, an inflatable toilet footrest may take a variety of shapes and sizes, and may comprise more than one piece, such as a two independent inflatable toilet footrests that create a squatting system. In yet another embodiment, an inflatable toilet footrest may be made from both rigid and flexible materials. For example, the foot portion and/or floor portion may be made from rigid materials, while the remaining portions remain flexible.

It should be understood that the steps of any such processes or methods are not limited to being carried out in any particular sequence, arrangement, or with any particular graphics or interface. Indeed, the steps of the disclosed processes or methods generally may be carried out in various different sequences and arrangements while still falling within the scope of the present invention. The present disclosure is directed to inflatable toilet footrests for use in the bathroom, restroom, or other room with a toilet or where defecation occurs. As generally illustrated in FIGS. 1-6, an inflatable toilet footrest 100 comprises a foot surface 102, a sidewall 104 extending downward therefrom and creating an airtight seal around the entire circumference of the foot surface 102 and also connected to a bottom portion 106, which creates a hollow airtight interior chamber between the foot surface 102 and bottom portion 106, and a valve 108. The airtight seal may be accomplished using a variety of known techniques, such as plastic welding, adhesive bonding, or equivalent. The valve 108 is used to inflate and deflate the inflatable toilet footrest 100, which adds to the portability of the inflatable toilet footrest 100. For example, the inflatable toilet footrest 100 may be deflated, folded, and easily transported, allowing a user to take their toilet footrest virtually anywhere they travel. In one embodiment, the inflatable toilet footrest 100 has a contoured front-side 110 (which may be created by using additional seams or sidewall shapes) and back-side (toilet-side) concave curvature 112 to aid the placement of the inflatable toilet footrest 100 at the base of a toilet. As such, minimal space is required when inflated and it further accommodates a variety of foot positions for users. For example, some users may prefer to have their feet closer to the sides of the toilet, while others may prefer their feet to be directly in front of the toilet. Back-side concave curvature 112 may also vary in size and need not wrap-around the base of the toilet. Although shown with front-side contour 110 and back-side concave curvature 112, such features are not required and the inflatable toilet footrest 100 may take other shapes. Inflatable toilet footrest 100 may be made from a variety of easily inflatable materials, such as vinyl, rubbers, silicones, plastics, and other materials that allow for shape, air retention, and durability. The inflatable toilet footrest 100 may also contain a bladder, but it is not required. Further the valve 108 may also be of many varieties known to those in the art, such as a standard gate valve for use with a pump (such as an electric pump, hand pump, or foot pump) or a user's mouth, or may also include a built-in hand pump or any other equivalent means for inflating the inflatable toilet footrest 100. FIG. 2 shows a top view of an inflatable toilet footrest 100. As shown, the back-side concave curvature 112 allows the stool to conform to the shape of a standard toilet, minimizing the space required to use the inflatable toilet footrest by allowing the stool to wrap around the sides of the toilet. This also allows the inflatable toilet footrest to be stored against the toilet when not in use without interfering with overall bathroom space. Back-side concave curvature 112 allows users to place their feet on enlarged ends 114, 116 or on the middle section 118. This allows the inflatable toilet footrest 100 to adapt to a variety of users and their preferences. FIG. 3 illustrates a back view of an inflatable toilet footrest. FIG. 4 illustrates a front view of an inflatable toilet footrest 100 with valve 108 and FIG. 5 illustrates a side view. While the inflatable toilet footrest 100 is generally illustrated as having top sidewall portion 120 and bottom sidewall portion 122, both of which are equal in size, it will be appreciated that only one portion is required and that multiple portions are not required to be the same size. Further, while foot surface 102 is generally shown as parallel to the surface on which the inflatable toilet footrest 100 sits, the one or more sidewall portions 120, 122 may be sized differently at one end in relation to the other (i.e., front and back ends, respectively), creating an angled surface for a user to place their feet. In other words, foot surface 102 may tilt forward (angle downward away from the toilet) or backward (angled towards a user on a toilet). Having an angled foot surface is beneficial for relieving stress and/or tension on the shins and other areas of the legs while squatting. FIG. 6 is a bottom view of inflatable toilet footrest 100. While not illustrated, inflatable toilet footrest 100 may comprise feet that not only help the inflatable toilet footrest 100 from slipping on a floor surface, but also help minimize the contact with a floor that is in the direct vicinity of a toilet, helping to keep the inflatable toilet footrest 100 cleaner. Further, in one embodiment, the inflatable toilet footrest may also have non-slip surfaces and/or raised surfaces. In another embodiment, not illustrated, a squatting system comprises at least two inflatable toilet footrests, sized so as to accommodate at least one standard human foot each. This allows a user to place the inflatable toilet footrests at any desired location, allowing complete customization for a user's squatting and elimination experience. For example, one user may desire to have the feet spread far apart and on the sides of a toilet, while another may prefer to keep the feet closer together in front of a toilet. Each user may place the individual footrests where desired. The inflatable toilet footrests are constructed similarly to other embodiments, comprising at least inflatable materials and a valve for inflation/deflation. In yet another embodiment, not illustrated, an inflatable toilet footrest may comprise both rigid and non-rigid portions. For example, a foot surface portion may be rigid so as so provide greater stability to a user. The bottom/floor portion may also be rigid, allowing for a steady contact surface. This may also be beneficial when the footrest is deflated, allowing the two rigid portions to come together and protect the inflatable portion. The rigid portions may further have straps, hooks, latches, or other similar means for coupling them one with another for protecting the inflatable portion therein and for easy transportation. The rigid portions may be made from any suitable material, such as rigid plastics, carbon fibers, metals, etc. The inflatable portion may be permanently affixed to the rigid portions, or may by removably attachable, such as by using snaps, hooks and loops (e.g., Velcro®), or any other suitable means. A method of using an inflatable toilet footrest may comprise a user inflating the inflatable toilet footrest, placing it at the front base of the toilet so that it wraps around the base of the toilet, sitting on the toilet, lifting the legs and resting the user's feet on the inflatable toilet footrest, which raises the knees closer to the chest, aligns the colon, and aids in the expulsion/elimination process. When using a squatting system, a user may inflate both footrests, place each of them in the desired location, and, while sitting on the toilet, rest their feet on the footrests respectively. It will be appreciated that the shape of the inflatable toilet footrest may be altered in order to better conform to the person using the inflatable toilet footrest as well as the toilet size, shape, height, or other variations common to toilets. While the forgoing examples are illustrative of the principles of the present invention in one or more particular applications, it will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art that numerous modifications in form, usage and details of implementation can be made without the exercise of inventive faculty, and without departing from the principles and concepts of the invention.
