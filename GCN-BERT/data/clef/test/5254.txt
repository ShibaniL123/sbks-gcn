CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/193,735, filed December 19, 2008. BACKGROUND [0002] Aggression and similar syndromes, including impulsivity and irritability, represent a broad category of behaviors that complicate the management of several disease states, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), bipolar disorder, autism, and post traumatic stress disorder. In some cases, 25-50% of patients optimally treated for the underlying disorder continue to manifest these syndromes (J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 2007 Mar;46(3):309-22.). [0003] Dopaminergic therapies are among the most prescribed for these behavioral syndromes, and include such molecules as haloperidol and other antipsychotics. The dopamine receptors for these molecules are grouped into 2 families: the Dl, which includes the Dl and D5 receptor, and the D2, which includes the D2, D3 and D4 receptors. The two families differ by the manner in which the receptor protein is incorporated into the cell membrane, and by the pharmacology of the molecules that have an affinity for each type. Each receptor type is a distinct entity with its unique gene, anatomy in the brain and affinity for different molecules. Some dopamine receptor subtypes, such as the D2 receptor, have further modifications in the protein structure, giving rise to further subclassification, e.g., D2,hoI1 and D2jong. [0004] There is increasing evidence that D5 receptor activity would be beneficial in the treatment of aggression and similar behavioral syndromes. [0005] The D5 receptor has very specific localization in the brain, and is found in such areas as the Parafascicular Nucleus of the Thalamus, as well as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, ventral tegmental area, Substantia Nigra and Raphe nucleus (Hartman DS, Civelli O. Molecular attributes of dopamine receptors: new potential for antipsychotic drug development. Ann Med 1996;28(3):211-9). The Parafascicular nucleus is involved in the behavioral process of attention to critical sensory input and activation of the subject toward that stimulus. One of the important paradigms in which the Parafascicular nucleus nucleus is likely involved in activating early components of aggressive behavior (Matsumoto Ν, Minamimoto Τ, Graybiel AM, Kimura Μ. Neurons in the thalamic CM-Pf complex supply striatal neurons with information about behaviorally significant sensory events. J Neurophysiol 2001;85(2):960-76). [0006] The gene for the D5, DRD5, is associated with impulsiveness and with symptomology associated with disruptive behavioral disorders, such as antisocial personality disorder (Vanyukov MM, Moss ΗΒ, Kaplan ΒΒ, Kirillova GP, Tarter RE. Antisociality, substance dependence, and the DRD5 gene: a preliminary study. Am J Med Genet 2000;96(5):654-8). DRD5 is also associated with genetic transmission of a number of disorders associated with aggression, irritability and impulsivity, including schizophrenia, Tourette’s and ADHD (Maher BS, Marazita ML, Ferrell RE, Vanyukov MM. Dopamine system genes and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: a meta-analysis. Psychiatr Genet 2002;12(4):207-15). Blockade of the D5 receptor in a knockout model is associated with decreased motor activity, which may be akin to decreased aggression (Holmes A, Hollon TR, Gleason TC, et al. Behavioral characterization of dopamine D5 receptor null mutant mice. Behav Neurosci 2001 ;115(5): 1129-44). [0007] Molindone is a typical antipsychotic drug that has high affinity for D2 family of dopamine receptors, where it is thought to exert its therapeutic action. Molindone was previously suggested for the treatment of aggression in both adult and pediatric patients (Greenhill LL, Barmack JE, Spalten D, Anderson Μ, Halpem F. Molindone Hydrochloride in the treatment of aggressive, hospitalized children [proceedings], Psychopharmacol Bull 1981;17(1): 125-7; Itil ΤΜ, Wadud A. Treatment of human aggression with major tranquilizers, antidepressants, and newer psychotropic drugs. J Nerv Ment Dis 1975;160(2-1):83-99). Molindone was also evaluated for children with the early-onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders (J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry, 2007, August, 46:8, ρ.969 - 978 and Am J Psychiatry, 165:11, Nov. 2008). [0008] For adults with schizophrenia, the dose of molindone may range from 100 to 225mg per day (Bagnall A, Fenton Μ, Kleijnen J, Lewis R. Molindone for schizophrenia and severe mental illness. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2007(1):CD002083). In general, the dose of other antipsychotics used for the treatment of aggressive behavior are about 50% relative to those used for the treatment of psychosis in schizophrenia (J Am Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry. 2006 Jul;45(7):792-800). [0009] The current invention offers a method of treatment of aggression and / or similar behavioral syndromes, including irritability and impulsivity that comprises the steps of: 1. selecting several active agents with known activity (e.g., agonist or antagonist) on at least one dopaminergic, serotonergic or gabaergic receptor where the opposite activity is associated with aggressive behavior; 2. conducting a receptor screening assay on these same receptor families with each of the active agents to identify activity for at least one additional receptor having a known association with undesired (i.e., aggressive) behavior; 3. determining if said activity is agonistic or antagonistic in nature; 4. by the results of steps 2 and 3, choosing among the screened active agents at least one that targets the most diverse types of aggression-associated receptors; 5. optimizing the total dose of the active agent(s), taking into account results of steps 2 through 4; and 6. administering the dose of step (5) to a mammalian subject. [0010] In one embodiment of the invention, the mammalian subject is a human child. In another embodiment of the invention, the mammalian subject is an adult human. [0011] Identification of agonist / antagonist activity in the active agents that exhibit the potential as therapeutics for aggression and similar behavioral syndromes is important, since it allows for selection of drugs that have more than one therapeutic target (e.g., both D2 and D5 receptors). This is superior to taking a combination of therapies to achieve multiple targets because of the enhanced patient compliance with the reduced pill load. It also can lead to a lower dose, since different receptor activities may be additive, or even synergistic, in their effect. [0012] Use of molecules that target a specific class of receptors with a limited distribution in the brain is also potentially beneficial in that it limits the potential for side effects. This restricted set of neural pathways is less likely to have “off-target” effect in the systems not involved in the desired activity. [0013] In one embodiment, the invention comprises a method of treatment of aggression and similar behavioral syndromes, such as impulsivity and irritability in a mammalian subject, by a pharmaceutical agent exhibiting combined D2 and D5 antagonistic activity. [0014] In another embodiment, the invention discloses a method of treatment of aggression and similar behavioral syndromes by a pharmaceutical agent exhibiting combined D2 and D5 dosage anticipated on the premise of D2 activity only. [0015] In yet another embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical agent is molindone. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0016] Figure 1 shows a competition curve obtained with compound SPN-810M (molindone) at the human D5 receptor. [0017] Figure 2 shows the agonist effect of compound SPN-810M at the Human D5 Receptor. [0018] Figure 3 shows the antagonist effect of compound SPN-810M at the Human D5 receptor. [0019] Figure 4 shows a reduction in Conduct Problem Subscale Score achieved through administration of molindone in a randomized, multicenter, parallel group dose-ranging study in children with ADHD and persistent serious conduct problems. [0020] Figure 5 shows an adverse effect profile of molindone in a randomized, multicenter, parallel group dose-ranging study in children with ADHD and persistent serious conduct problems DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0021] It was unexpectedly discovered that, in addition to the well-documented D2-receptor group antagonistic activity, molindone has specific antagonist activity at the D5 dopaminergic receptor. [0022] A heterologous competition assay was designed for a receptor affinity screening of molindone. Recombinant D5 receptors were expressed in a GH4 cell line and specific binding was characterized by displacement of another molecule with affinity for the D5 receptor (the “ligand”). “Specific binding” refers here to the difference in the binding of the ligand to the receptors in the presence and absence of an excess of the active agent. An initial screen was performed with 10^μΜ molindone. The conditions and results of the assay are summarized in the Tables 1 and 2. Assay Figand Cone.

For this experiment, a range of molindone concentrations was selected for the ligand blocking assay. The IC50 was determined using non-linear regression analysis of the competition curves using Hill equation curve fitting. The inhibition constants Ki, wherein Ki is defined as the concentration of the competing ligand (molindone) that will bind to half the binding sites at equilibrium in the absence of radioligand or other competitors, were calculated using Cheng Prusoff equation. The results of the affinity assay are summarized in Tables 3 and 4, and in Fig.l. Table 3.

For the D5 receptor, this was accomplished through an assay that examined the agonist effect on the D5 receptor, i.e., the generation of ℮ΑΜΡ or the blockade of this effect when stimulated by a D5 agonist, dopamine. This was also done with a range of concentrations to determine the relative agonist vs antagonist binding Ki. The EC50 values causing a half-maximal inhibition of the control-specific agonist response) were determined by non-linear regression analysis of the concentration-response curves generated with mean replicate values using Hill equation curve fitting. The apparent dissociation constants for antagonists Kb were calculated using the modified Cheng Prusoff equation. [0025] The conditions of the screening are presented in Table 5. It was found that molindone (10~5 μΜ) exhibited 59% inhibition of the SCH23390 binding at the D5 receptor. The Ki was determined to be 2.4x10~6. The binding was determined to be that of an antagonist. The full results of the screening are summarized in Tables 6-8 and in Fig. 2-3. Table 5.

EC50 Determination for D5 (h): Individual Data (Agonist Effect) [0026] Based on the receptor findings, it was suggested that molindone may be effective for the treatment of aggression in humans, in particular, in children with ADHD, in smaller doses than is currently customary. A lower daily dose of the drug results in a diminishing frequency and severity of the adverse effects of the treatment to a level of tolerability, thus resulting in improvement in patient compliance. [0027] In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a method of treatment of aggression in humans, in particular children, diagnosed with ADHD , bipolar disorder, autism, and post lower than the current dose for its use as an antipsychotic agent. In other embodiments, the dose is 15% lower, 25% lower, 35% lower, and 50% lower than the current dose. [0028] In one embodiment of the invention, molindone is administered in a dose range of from 10 mg/day to 200 mg/day. In other embodiments, molindone is administered in dose ranges of from 3 mg/day to 200 mg/day; 15 mg/day to 120 mg/day; 15 mg/day to 90 mg/day; 30 mg/day to 90 mg/day; or 36 mg/day to 72 mg/day. [0029] The success of the treatment is evident in the marked decrease in the number instances of undesirable behavior exhibiting aggression, irritability and impulsivity. Such behavior may be exemplified, without limitation, by disobedience; negativism; provocative opposition to authority figures; violations of minor rules; temper tantrums; argumentativeness; provocative behavior; stubbornness; blaming others for his or her own mistakes; being touchy, easily annoyed, angry, resentful, spiteful or vindictive; and swearing. [0030] In another embodiment, the invention encompasses a method of treatment of aggression in children with ADHD with molindone that is characterized by an improved adverse effect profile. The adverse effects that are diminished by the method of the present invention may be, but are not limited to, drowsiness, depression, hyperactivity and euphoria, extrapyramidal reactions, akathisia, akinesia, dystonic syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, tachycardia, nausea, dry mouth, urinary retention, and constipation. [0031] The efficacy and the adverse effect profile of the lower dose treatment of the current invention were evaluated in a Randomized, Multicenter, Parallel Group, Dose Ranging Study to Evaluate the Safety and Tolerability of molindone in Children with Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Persistent Serious Conduct Problems, where the subjects are administered molindone hydrochloride given 3 times daily in a dose range of 5 to 20 mg/day in children < 30 kg, and 10 to 40 mg/day in children > 30 kg (Example 1 and Fig. 4)· EXAMPLE 1 [0032] Effectiveness, safety and tolerability of molindone was evaluated in a randomized, multicenter, parallel group dose-ranging study in children with ADHD and persistent serious conduct problems. Subjects were randomized based on weight at baseline to 1 of 4 treatment groups. The dosing for subjects with weight of less than 30 kg was initiated at 1.67 mg/day and 3.34 mg/day for subjects weighing 30 kg or more. A titration schedule was followed dose for 6 weeks (Table 9). Table 9.
