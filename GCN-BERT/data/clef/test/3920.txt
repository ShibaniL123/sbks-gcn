The invention relates to novel compounds for the preparation of compositions useful for the treatment of diseases resulting from changes in splicing processes. Certain indole derivative compounds such as ellipticine derivatives and aza-ellipticine derivatives are already known as intercalating molecules for correcting dysfunctions in gene expression, notably in DNA replication. They have been more specifically described for treating diseases such as cancer, leukemia or AIDS (see in particular patents FR 2 627 493, FR 2 645 861, FR 2 436 786). Concerning current treatments for AIDS, the various approaches aimed at reducing viral load in patients infected by HIV utilize molecules intended to inhibit the enzymatic activity of viral reverse transcriptase or of the protease involved in virus protein maturation. Regarding reverse transcriptase inhibitors, these can be nucleosidic (NRTIs), non-nucleosidic (NNRTIs) or nucleotidic in nature. The purpose of using these compounds is to prevent a DNA copy of the retroviral genome from being produced and, consequently, from being integrated into the genome of the host cell. Protease inhibitors (PIs) interfere with the proper maturation of viral proteins and cause the production of incomplete particles with altered infectious capacities. There is another type of anti-retroviral compound used for its ability to prevent viruses from entering the cell. These entry inhibitors can be either peptides that interfere with the fusion of viral glycoproteins gp41 or gp120 with the membrane of CD4 cells or molecules that target HIV cellular co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4. The absence of cellular proteins resembling HIV integrase has also been exploited to develop novel anti-HIV molecules that inhibit this enzymatic activity. Although a number of integrase inhibitors are in the clinical trial phase, no molecule is yet available on the market. The intracellular splicing process consists of eliminating introns in pre-messenger RNAs to produce mature messenger RNAs that can be used by the translation mechanism of the cell (SHARP, Cell, vol. 77, p. 805-815, 1994). In the case of alternative splicing, the same precursor can be the source of messenger RNAs coding for proteins with distinct functions (BLACK, Annu. Rev. Biochem. vol. 72, p. 291-336, 2003). The precise selection of 5′ and 3′ splicing sites is thus a mechanism that generates diversity and that can lead to the regulation of gene expression according to the type of tissue or during the development of an organism. The factors involved in this selection include a family of proteins called SR, characterized by the presence of one or two RNA recognition motifs (RRM) and a domain rich in arginine and serine residues called an RS domain (MANLEY & TACKE, Genes Dev., vol. 10, p. 1569-1579, 1996). By binding to short exon or intron sequences of the pre-mRNA, called ESE (exonic splicing enhancer) or ISE (intronic splicing enhancer), SR proteins are able to activate, in a dose-dependant manner, sub-optimal splicing sites and to enable the inclusion of exons (GRAVELEY, RNA, vol. 6, p. 1197-1211, 2000). The activity of an SR protein in alternative splicing is specific insofar as the inactivation of the corresponding gene is lethal (WANG et al., Mol. Cell, vol. 7, p. 331-342, 2001). Sequencing of the human genome and analysis of EST (expressed sequence tag) banks has revealed that 65% of genes are expressed in the form of alternatively spliced variants (EWING & GREEN, Nat. Genet., vol. 25, p. 232-234, 2000; JOHNSON et al., Science, vol. 302, p. 2141-2144, 2003). This mechanism is thus a favored target of modifications that can affect the factors involved in regulating splicing and of mutations that affect the sequences necessary for this regulation. At present, it is estimated that roughly 50% of the point mutations responsible for genetic diseases induce aberrant splicing. These mutations can interfere with splicing by inactivating or creating splicing sites, but also by modifying or generating regulating elements such as splicing enhancers or splicing silencers in a particular gene (CARTEGNI et al., Nat. Rev. Genet., vol. 3, p. 285-298, 2002; TAZI et al., TIBS, vol. 40, p. 469-478, 2005). The strategies currently developed to correct these splicing defects rest on the use of various types of molecules (TAZI et al., cited above, 2005). One strategy aimed at developing novel molecules to correct or eliminate abnormal splicing, for example, rests on the overexpression of proteins that interfere with this type of splicing (NISSIM-RAFINIA et al., Hum. Mol. Genet., vol. 9, p. 1771-1778, 2000; HOFINANN et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., vol. 97, p. 9618-9623, 2000). Other strategies rest on the use of antisense oligonucleotides (SAZANI et al., Nat. Biotechnol., vol. 20, p. 1228-1233, 2002; SAZANI & KOLE, Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol., vol. 31, p. 217-239, 2003) or of PNA (CARTEGNI et al., Nat. Struct. Biol., vol. 10, p. 120-125, 2003) enabling, respectively, the inhibition or activation of a splicing event. Yet another strategy rests on the identification of compounds that influence the splicing efficiency of the pre-mRNA of interest (ANDREASSI et al., Hum. Mol. Genet., vol. 10, p. 2841-2849, 2001). Lastly, a strategy based on the use of trans-splicing to replace mutant exons has been described (LIU et al., Nat. Biotechnol., vol. 20, p. 47-52, 2002). One of the disadvantages of the developed strategies cited above to correct or eliminate abnormal splicing is their production cost. Indeed, the cost of producing antisense oligonucleotides that must be modified to improve their stability, and that of PNA molecules, is high. Another disadvantage of the developed strategies cited above is that they require the use of expression vectors, such as, for example, for the strategy based on the use of trans-splicing. International application WO05023255, under French priority of applications FR0310460 and FR0400973, filed by the Applicant, disclosed the use of indole derivatives to treat diseases related to the pre-messenger RNA splicing process in the cell. Thus it was recently shown that certain indole derivatives prove particularly effective in treating metastatic cancer and in treating AIDS (BAKKOUR et al., PLoS Pathogens, vol. 3, p. 1530-1539, 2007). However, the compounds described have a flat structure with four rings that have the disadvantage of intercalating between DNA bases and can thus lead to cellular toxicity. In order to minimize the risk that these indole derivatives intercalate between DNA bases, the inventors developed novel compounds that are particularly effective in treating diseases related to the splicing process, but which, in a surprising manner, have a cellular toxicity that is clearly less than the indole derivatives of the prior art. In addition, these compounds are able to selectively inhibit certain splicing events.

Pharmalogical Data The compounds of the invention have been the subject of pharmacological tests which have demonstrated their relevance as active substances in therapy and in particular for preventing, inhibiting or treating AIDS. Example 9 Development of IDC16 Derivative Compounds The inventors have shown that compound IDC16 (BAKKOUR et al., cited above, 2007) interacts functionally with the SF2/ASF complex and thus contributes to blocking alternative splicing during HIV replication, leading to the termination of the production of Tat protein. Accordingly, the family of polycyclic indoles, to which compound IDC16 belongs, is known to exhibit the properties of DNA intercalating agents. Such compounds thus present a risk in terms of undesirable side effects. The inventors thus sought to develop novel molecules exhibiting activity comparable to IDC16, in terms of activity inhibiting HIV splicing, but while not exhibiting the characteristics of DNA intercalating agents. In their initial hypothesis, the inventors considered that the two polar heterocycles at the two ends of compound IDC16 were associated with its activity and that the two median rings were of less importance. Based on this hypothesis, the inventors considered that: the nitrogen of the indoline and of the D ring of IDC16 might act as acceptors of hydrogen bonds;the N-methylated 4-pyridinone motif might be preserved in the analogues;the flat tetracyclic geometry was not optimal and it might be wise to replace the B and C rings by other motifs to limit DNA intercalating properties. Example 10 Inhibition of HIV-1 Production in Infected Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) Material and Methods The first determination is that of the concentration of compound that exhibits the fewest side effects in terms of cell viability and progression of the cell cycle. Within this framework, the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy donors are isolated by centrifugation on a FICOLL gradient. The cells are then cultivated to a density of 2.5×106 cells/ml with RPMI medium supplemented with 1% inactivated human AB serum, then incubated at 37° C., 5% CO2 for an additional hour. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells are then recovered and cultivated for two days in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. A standard experiment using 96 plates to test 30 molecules in triplicates including positive and negative controls, is performed as follows: 50 106 Ficoll purified PBMCs (10% DMSO 90% FCS) are washed with RPMI 10% FCS and resuspended in 25 ml of RPMI 10% FCS, glutamax containing 1000 U/ml of IL2 and 5 μg/ml PHA. The cells are then incubated for 3 days at 37° C. before to be washed with 50 ml PBS then with 50 ml RPMI 10% FCS. The cells are resuspended in 100 μl of RPMI 10% FCS containing 100 U/ml IL2 and seeded in 96 wells (1.5 105 cells/well). Viral infection is performed with 1 ng of AdaM/well. 100 μA of tested molecules at concentration of 10 μM are added to each well. Virus production is determined by p24 antigen immunosorbent assays after 3 and 6 days of infection (Kit Innogenetics). Typically PBMCs are prepared from several healthy donors (around 11 different donors). Dose response curves were then established with selected compounds to determine IC50. Protocol for Cytotoxicity: To evaluate the cytoxicity of different compounds we used the same protocol as above to seed the HOS-CD4+-CCR5+ cells or PBMCs in a final volume of 100 μl without adding the virus. After an incubation for 48 h at 37° C., the medium was removed and cells were incubated with 20 μl of CellTiter96 AqueousOne solution to determine the number of viable cells in proliferation and cytotoxicity assays (Promega). CellTiter96 AqueousOne is a colorimetric assay solution that has many advantages compared to MTT assays and gives us satisfactory results. We have also evaluated the effect of selected molecules on CD4 and CD8 proliferation using the division tracking dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (In vitrogen).

For such experiences, macrophages can be infected by the Ada-M R5 HIV strain and treated for 18 hours with various concentrations of the compounds of the present invention. The culture medium is then eliminated and the cells washed with an abundance of PBS. The cells are then cultivated under normal conditions. The culture medium and the cells are then collected at days 4, 7 and 14. Finally, virus replication is measured indirectly by determining the level of p24 antigen in both the culture supernatant and the cellular lysate by the ELISA method. In parallel, cell viability of the macrophages in the presence of the compounds of the present invention is measured as before. For this purpose, we exposed HOS-CD4+-CCR5+ cells to defective virions obtained by cotransfecting 293T cells with a plasmid encoding the R5 envelope of the AD8 strain and another plasmid containing the entire HIV-1 genome mutated in the envelope gene and harbouring a luciferase marker gene fused to nef (Connor R I, Chen B K, Choe S, Landau N R. (1995) Vpr is required for efficient replication of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 in mononuclear phagocytes. Virology 206: 935-944). The amounts of luciferase activity in cells infected with these virions reflect both the number of integrated proviruses and expression of multiply spliced species encoding nef/luc. Two days post-infection, luciferase activity in HOS-CD4+-CCR5+ infected cells was measured. The results are shown below: Compound Results (121) of the table I + (2) of the table I − (6) + (5) of the table I − (10) of the table I + (14) of the table I − − − − + − The results established that the compounds of the present invention show a luciferase inhibitory effect, thus showing that these compounds inhibit viral RNA splicing.
