To a mixture of 0.081 g (0.22 mmol) of (7-hydroxy-6-methoxy-2-methylbenzofuran-3-yl)(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)methanone, 0.086 g (0.261 mmol) of carbon tetrabromide and 0.063 ml (0.283 mmol) of dibenzylphosphite in 2.5 ml of anhydrous acetonitrile 0.046 ml of anhydrous triethylamine was added dropwise at 0Â° C. under nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting mixture was stirred for 2 h at room temperature, then diluted to 20 ml with ethyl acetate, washed with water brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered off and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash column chromatography (dichloromethane/ethyl acetate, 9:1) to give the title compound as a colorless foam (0.13 g, 94%);
