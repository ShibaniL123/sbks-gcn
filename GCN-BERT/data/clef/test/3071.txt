Step 6: preparation of intermediate 3-oxazol-2-yl-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (7f)
To a solution of 6-allyloxy-3-oxazol-2-yl-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (7e) (160 mg, 0.65 mmol) and glacial AcOH (59.5 ÂµL, 1.04 mmol) in anhydrous DCM (6.5 mL) was added in one portion Pd(PPh3)4 (374 mg, 0.32 mmol) at rt. After stirring for 30 min, the mixture was concentrated under nitrogen flux. The residue was purified by chromatography on silica gel (DCM/Acetone: 100/0 to 50/50) to afford 3-oxazol-2-yl-1,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-en-7-one (7f) (122 mg, 0.59 mmol, 91%).
