In the whole pharmaceutical composition of the present invention (a pharmaceutical composition containing at least a nonpeptidic pharmaceutically active ingredient having a primary or secondary amino group, an excipient and an acidic compound), the content (%) of the “pharmaceutically active ingredient having a primary or secondary amino group or a salt thereof” is preferably 0.1-80%, further preferably 0.1-60%, particularly preferably 0.1-50% (in the present specification, “%” means weight percent unless otherwise specified). [2. Excipient (Second Component)] As the “excipient”, which is the second component of the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, preferred is an excipient having pH 4.5 or above when dissolved or dispersed in water. Examples of such excipient include mannitol, croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, polyethylene glycol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, crystalline cellulose, lactose, sucrose, starch, cornstarch, titanium oxide (TiO2), light anhydrous silicic acid and the like. These excipients may be used alone or two or more kinds thereof may be used in combination. Of these, as the excipient, mannitol, hydroxypropylcellulose and crystalline cellulose are preferable. The content (%) of the excipient in the whole pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is preferably 20-99.8%, further preferably 40-99.8%, particularly preferably 50-99.8%. In the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, the mixing ratio of the “excipient” to the “nonpeptidic pharmaceutically active ingredient having a primary or secondary amino group or a salt thereof” (to be abbreviated as “pharmaceutically active ingredient”) is preferably pharmaceutically active ingredient:excipient=1:0.25-1:998, further preferably 1:0.67-1:998, particularly preferably 1:1-1:998. The above-mentioned mixing ratio is a weight ratio. [3. Acidic Compound (Third Component)] Here, the term acidic compound has a general meaning. Specifically, for example, the term can be defined based on the value of pKa (logarithm of reciprocal of acid dissociation constant) of the compound. The “acidic compound” means a compound having a partial structure having pKa of not more than 6.5 (preferably not more than 5.5). The acidic compound to be used in the present invention may be either a solid or a liquid at ambient temperature (15-25° C.). The above-mentioned “partial structure having pKa” refers to a partial structure that releases H+. The above-mentioned “nonpeptidic pharmaceutically active ingredient having a primary or secondary amino group (first component)” has a “primary or secondary amino group having high nucleophilicity”. Thus, when a trace amount of a basic component is contained in the excipient, the basic component acts as a basic catalyst and highly possibly causes problems of Michael addition of, for example, fumaric acid and the like to an α or β-unsaturated carbonyl compound (nucleophilic addition reaction of a carbon at the end of a conjugated system in conjugation with an electron-withdrawing substituent) and the like. Examples of the above-mentioned basic compound which is contained in the excipient and having a possibility of acting as a basic catalyst include a basic salt, oxide and hydroxide, such as metal carbonates such as alkali metal hydrogen carbonates (e.g., sodium hydrogen carbonate etc.), alkali metal carbonates (e.g., sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate etc.), alkaline earth metal carbonates (e.g., calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate etc.) and the like; di-salt hydrogen phosphate such as di-alkali metal salt hydrogen phosphates (e.g., disodium hydrogen phosphate, dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, etc.) and the like; silicates such as calcium silicate, magnesium silicate and the like; metal oxides such as magnesium oxide and the like; metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, aluminum hydroxide and the like; citrates such as sodium citrate and the like; tartrates such as sodium dl- and l-tartrates and the like; pantothenates such as calcium pantothenate etc, and the like. Therefore, a stabilizer is added to the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention. The stabilizer stabilizes the pharmaceutical composition by preventing a reaction of an amino group in the nonpeptidic pharmaceutically active ingredient having a primary or secondary amino group with an α or β-unsaturated carbonyl compound. As the stabilizer, any substance can be used as long as it is an acidic compound which can protonate, by releasing H+, the amino group of the nonpeptidic pharmaceutically active ingredient having a primary or secondary amino group, preferably an organic acid or a salt thereof (particularly organic acid). Specifically, the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention characteristically contains an acidic compound (third component) as the stabilizer in addition to a pharmaceutical composition containing a nonpeptidic pharmaceutically active ingredient having a primary or secondary amino group (first component) and an excipient (second component). As the “acidic compound” to be used in the present invention, an inorganic acid such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, or an organic acid similar to the organic acid exemplified in the explanation of the above-mentioned “salt with an organic acid of a nonpeptidic pharmaceutically active ingredient having a primary or secondary amino group” can be used. Particularly preferable examples thereof include edible organic acids such as adipic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, oleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, sorbic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, citric anhydride, maleic anhydride, phthalic anhydride, malic acid and the like. In addition, an organic acid such as formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, phthalic acid, oxalic acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like can also be used for the object of stabilization of the pharmaceutical composition. The organic acid may be a salt. Examples of the salt with an organic acid include sodium ascorbate, sodium fumarate, and those similar to the salts exemplified in the above-mentioned “salt with an organic acid of a nonpeptidic pharmaceutically active ingredient having a primary or secondary amino group”. Of these, those similar to the salts exemplified in the above-mentioned “salt with an organic acid of a nonpeptidic pharmaceutically active ingredient having a primary or secondary amino group” are preferable. In addition, the salt with an organic acid similar to the above-mentioned respective organic acids are preferable. These organic acids and salts thereof may be used alone or two or more kinds thereof may be used simultaneously. In addition, the organic acid to be used for the above-mentioned “salt with an organic acid of a nonpeptidic pharmaceutically active ingredient having a primary or secondary amino group” and an organic acid to be used as a stabilizer may be the same or different. As the organic acid to be used for the above-mentioned “salt with an organic acid of a nonpeptidic pharmaceutically active ingredient having a primary or secondary amino group”, preferred are fumaric acid, malonic acid, citric anhydride, maleic anhydride, succinic acid and tartaric acid, more preferred are fumaric acid, citric anhydride, succinic acid, tartaric acid, and still more preferred are fumaric acid, succinic acid and tartaric acid. The pH of an excipient or acidic compound is measured under the following conditions. To be specific, the pH of an aqueous solution or dispersion obtained by dissolving or dispersing an excipient in water at 1% w/v is measured at 25° C. with a commercially available pH meter. In the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, the pKa value of the “nonpeptidic pharmaceutically active ingredient having a primary or secondary amino group” is preferably higher for stabilization of the pharmaceutical composition than that of the “organic acid or a salt thereof” to be added. Particularly, the difference between the pKa value of the “nonpeptidic pharmaceutically active ingredient having a primary or secondary amino group” and that of the “organic acid” is preferably not less than 4, further preferably not less than 5, particularly preferably not less than 6. For example, when the pharmaceutically active ingredient is represented by the formula (A2), an “organic acid” is preferably used as an acidic compound. Examples of the “organic acid” include edible organic acids such as adipic acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, oleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, sorbic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, citric acid, malic acid and the like. In addition, organic acids such as formic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, phthalic acid, oxalic acid, methanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like can also be used for stabilizing the pharmaceutical composition. Of these, fumaric acid is particularly preferable. The content (%) of the acidic compound in the whole pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is preferably 0.1-20% (more preferably 0.1-19%), further preferably 1-10%, particularly preferably 2-10%. In another embodiment, it is 0.01-50%, preferably 0.05-19%, more preferably 0.1-10%. In the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, the mixing ratio of the “acidic compound” to the “nonpeptidic pharmaceutically active ingredient having a primary or secondary amino group” (to be abbreviated as a “pharmaceutically active ingredient”) is preferably pharmaceutically active ingredient:acidic compound=1:0.00125-1:200, further preferably 1:0.0167-1:200, particularly preferably 1:0.04-1:100. In the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, the mixing ratio of the “acidic compound” to the “excipient” is preferably excipient:acidic compound=1:0.0001-1:1, further preferably 1:0.01-1:0.5, particularly preferably 1:0.02-1:0.2. When producing the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, the “acidic compound” may be added as a powder in a granulation step or a mixing step. In addition, an acidic compound can be sprayed by dissolving or dispersing in a binder solution in the granulation step or in a film coating solution in a film coating step.

The amount of the “film coating polymer” to be used can be determined according to the kind of the solid preparation. For example, when the solid preparation is a tablet, the amount is about 0.5-10 wt % of the tablet. The spray temperature is generally 25-80° C., the spray time is generally 5 min-24 hr, and the drying conditions are generally at 30-80° C. for about 1 min-24 hr. The film coating layer of the present invention can be generally formed at ratio of 1-10 parts by weight, preferably 2-6 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the solid preparation (preferably tablet, more preferably ellipse or round tablet) of the present invention.

Next, the second invention of the present invention is explained in detail by referring to a specific embodiment. The solid preparation of the second invention of the present invention contains a pharmaceutically active ingredient, titanium oxide, a plasticizer and a chain organic acid, and is characteristically a solid preparation improved in the stability during light irradiation. When a pharmaceutically active ingredient unstable to light irradiation is formulated into a preparation, titanium oxide (TiO2) is generally used together with a film coating agent (also referred to as a coating agent) for shielding to ensure light-stability of the preparation. However, TiO2 shows a shielding function due to its high refractive index, but also shows a strong oxidation action caused by hole generation during light irradiation. The cause is presumed to be that 1) titanium oxide in a coating agent develops a free radical due to UV light, 2) the drug and alcohols in the coating agent such as polyethylene glycol and the like are decomposed due to free radical, 3) a decomposed product of alcohols (e.g., polyethylene glycol and the like), for example, aldehydes such as formaldehyde, acetoaldehyde and the like, an acid such as formic acid and the like, and peroxide in the coating agent further cause decomposition of the drug. To improve the light-stability of the preparation, therefore, it is necessary to suppress the decomposed product due to its strong oxidation action while utilizing the light shielding effect of TiO2. Conventionally, as a means to suppress an increase in the decomposed product, a method including forming an intermediate layer between a film coating and a core tablet and a method including removing PEG (plasticizer) from a film coating component have generally been employed. However, these methods may decrease the productivity during film coating, which may influence the final appearance of a film-coated tablet. The present inventors have found an effect of suppressing a decomposed product during light irradiation by adding a chain organic acid to the solid preparation (either core or film), without decreasing the productivity during film coating. The solid preparation of the present invention improved in the light stability is explained in the following.

Of the aforementioned pharmaceutically active ingredients, a pharmaceutically active ingredient that can particularly enjoy the effect of the invention is a pharmaceutically active ingredient unstable to light irradiation. For example, the present invention is particularly effective for a pharmaceutically active ingredient represented by the above-mentioned formula (A1), the formula (A2), the formula (A3) or the formula (A4), which belongs to the “pharmaceutically active ingredient unstable to light irradiation”. That is, the present invention has a remarkable effect for improving the stability of a pharmaceutically active ingredient represented by the above-mentioned formula (A1), the formula (A2), the formula (A3) or the formula (A4) to light irradiation. [Titanium Oxide (Component II)] In the present invention, titanium oxide has a superior shielding effect against light. The particle size of titanium oxide to be used in the present invention is generally about 0.01-about 1.5 μm, preferably about 0.1-about 0.7 μm. When titanium oxide is added to a coating agent for film-coated tablets and the like, the content of titanium oxide is such an amount capable of achieving the object of shielding of the pharmaceutical preparation, which is preferably about 5-about 30 wt %, more preferably about 5-about 20 wt %, of the coating agent.

Examples of PEG actually used as the plasticizer include macrogol (manufactured by Sanyo chemical industries, Ltd.). While the average molecular weight of PEG is not particularly limited, it is preferably not less than 200, more preferably 200-20000, since a smaller average molecular weight increases hygroscopicity. When PEG is added to a coating agent for a film-coated tablet and the like, the content of PEG is preferably about 5-about 30 wt %, especially about 10-25 wt %, more preferably about 10-about 20 wt %, of the coating agent. [Chain Organic Acid (Component IV)] In the solid preparation of the present invention, titanium oxide is used for shielding. However, it is known that since titanium oxide has a strong oxidation action as mentioned above, when a coating agent containing a light shielding agent such as titanium oxide and the like and a plasticizer such as polyethylene glycol and the like is applied to a drug-containing tablet during formulation of a preparation of a drug unstable to light, the obtained film-coated tablet becomes inferior to the tablet before a coating treatment in the stability to light. The present invention effectively suppresses, without decreasing the productivity during film coating, generation of a decomposed product during light irradiation by adding an organic acid, particularly a chain organic acid, together with titanium oxide to, for example, a solid preparation such as a film coating agent and the like. Examples of the chain organic acid include adipic acid, oleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, tartaric acid, sorbic acid, fumaric acid, lactic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, citric acid, malic acid and the like. These organic acids may be used alone, or two or more kinds thereof may be used simultaneously. The chain organic acid preferably has pH 6.0 or below when dissolved or dispersed in water. The chain organic acid is preferably fumaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or tartaric acid, more preferably fumaric acid, succinic acid or tartaric acid. The pH of a chain organic acid is measured under the following conditions. To be specific, the pH of an aqueous solution or dispersion obtained by dissolving or dispersing a measurement target in water at 1% w/v is measured at 25° C. with a commercially available pH meter. The content (%) of the chain organic acid in the whole pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is preferably 0.1-20% (more preferably 0.1-19%), further preferably 1-10%, particularly preferably 2-10%. In another embodiment, it is 0.01-50%, preferably 0.05-19%, more preferably 0.1-10%. When producing the pharmaceutical composition of the present invention, the “chain organic acid” may be added as a powder in a granulation step or a mixing step. In addition, a chain organic acid can be sprayed by dissolving or dispersing in a binder solution in the granulation step or in a film coating solution in a film coating step. The solid preparation containing the pharmaceutically active ingredient of the present invention has low toxicity, and can be safely administered orally or parenterally (e.g., topical, rectal, intravenous administration etc.) as it is or in the form of a pharmaceutical composition containing a pharmacologically acceptable carrier according to a method known per se, for example, as preparations such as tablet (core tablet, sugar-coated tablet, film-coated tablet etc.), powder, granule, capsule (including soft capsule), orally disintegrating tablet, suppository, sustained-release preparation and the like. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is preferably administered as an oral preparation such as tablet, granule, capsule and the like.

The film-coated tablet is obtained by coating a core tablet (core) containing a pharmaceutically active ingredient with a film coating layer comprising the following film coating polymer. Generally, a pharmaceutically active ingredient is contained in a core, but titanium oxide, a chain organic acid and a plasticizer may be contained in either or both of a core or(and) a film coating layer. Particularly, titanium oxide and a plasticizer are preferably contained in a film coating layer. In addition, a core material containing a chain organic acid and a layer containing an active ingredient do not need to be separated by a separating layer. A film coating solution is sprayed on a solid preparation (preferably tablet, more preferably ellipse or round tablet), and dried as necessary. The “film coating solution” is prepared by, for example, dissolving or suspending a film coating polymer in a solvent. The film coating solution may further contain, for example, a colorant (preferably, diiron trioxide and yellow ferric oxide), a light shielding agent (preferably, titanium oxide) and the like.

The amount of the “film coating polymer” to be used can be selected according to the kind of the solid preparation and, when the solid preparation is a tablet, it is, for example, about 0.5-10 wt % of a tablet. The spraying temperature is generally 25-80° C., the spraying time is generally 5 min-24 hr, and the drying conditions are generally 30-80° C. for about 1 min-24 hr. The film coating layer of the present invention can be formed at a ratio of generally 1-10 parts by weight, preferably 2-6 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the solid preparation (preferably tablet, more preferably ellipse or round tablet) of the present invention. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be formulated into a preparation for oral administration (film-coated tablet) by, for example, adding, where necessary, an excipient to the above-mentioned component I and component IV to give a granulated powder, adding, where necessary, a binder, a disintegrant, a lubricant and the like thereto, tableting the obtained mixture by a method known per se and, where necessary, coating the tablet by a method known per se for masking of taste, enteric coating or sustained release.

Particularly, an increase in the decomposed product U-6, which strikingly increases in the absence of an organic acid, was remarkably suppressed. U-6 was remarkably suppressed when fumaric acid was added during granulation by any of solution/dispersion addition including dissolving or dispersing fumaric acid in water and spraying the solution or dispersion, powder addition including addition of organic acid as a powder, and a combination of solution/dispersion addition and powder addition. An increase in the decomposed product was suppressed as the concentration of the organic acid in the tablet became higher. When the organic acid concentration was 1% or above, an increase in U-6 was strikingly suppressed. When it was 2% or above, the suppressive effect was still more remarkable. By the addition of an organic acid, a remarkable decomposed product suppressive effect was observed in both a plain tablet (core tablet) and a film-coated tablet, and the plain tablet (core tablet) and the film-coated tablet showed no difference in the amount of increase. By the addition of an organic acid, a decomposed product suppressive effect was observed irrespective of the concentration of compound A.

Even when organic acid was added to the core tablet part or the film part, a decomposed product suppressive effect was observed. When added to the core tablet part, a remarkable suppression was observed with 2.3% or above. When added to the film part, a remarkable suppression was observed with 4.7% or above. Even when PEG was added to a film coating component, stabilization was achieved to a level equal to or higher than the absence of PEG by the addition of an organic acid. Since the production of a decomposed product can be suppressed by the addition of an organic acid, suppression of change in the appearance after light irradiation is sufficiently predicted. Hence, a high quality pharmaceutical composition superior in light-stability can be provided. Experimental Example 6 Measurement Method of Decomposed Product The film-coated tablet (sample 76) obtained in Comparative Example 9 was examined for the production of compound B total decomposed product before xenon light irradiation and after xenon light irradiation. The decomposed product was measured by extracting the tablet with water/MeCN mixture (1:3) by HPLC. The HPLC test conditions are as follows. detector: ultraviolet absorption spectrophotometer (measurement wavelength: 230 nm) column: CAPCELL PAK C18 MGII, 3 μm, 4.6 mm i.d.×100 mm (manufactured by Shiseido Co., Ltd.) column temperature: fixed temperature around 40° C. mobile phase A: 0.05 mol/L sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)/acetonitrile mixture (9:1) mobile phase B: 0.05 mol/L sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)/acetonitrile mixture (2:3) mobile phase delivery: density gradient was controlled by changing mixing ratio of mobile phase A and mobile phase B as follows.
