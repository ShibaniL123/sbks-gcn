Step 3
N-(1-(3-(benzyloxy)-2-methylphenyl)propan-2-yl)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropan-1-amine
The crude 1-(3-(benzyloxy)-2-methylphenyl)propan-2-amine 70c (4.78 g, 18.7 mmol), 2-fluoro-2-methylpropyl trifluoromethanesulfonate 1b (8.4 g, 37.4 mmol) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (7.24 g, 56.1 mmol) were dissolved in 80mL of 1,4-dioxane. The reaction was warmed up to 100Â°C and stirred for 12 hours, then the reaction was stopped. The reaction solution was cooled to room temperature and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by CombiFlash flash preparation instrument with elution system B to obtain the title compound N-(1-(3-(benzyloxy)-2-methylphenyl)propan-2-yl)-2-fluoro-2-methylpropan-1-amine 70d (1.25g, yield 20%) as a yellow brown oil.
