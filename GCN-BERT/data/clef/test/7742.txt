KERATIN TREATMENT FORMULATIONS AND METHODS CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 61/994,709, filed May 16, 2014, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention generally relates to formulations and methods for treating keratin in hair, skin, or nails, and in particular for strengthening and/or repairing hair during or after a coloring or permanent wave treatment. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hair coloring is currently a globally accepted fashion phenomenon. Color treatments include hair coloring, highlighting, and bleaching. The coloring products can be categorized in several types, which include permanent, demi-permanent, semi-permanent, and temporary coloring formulations. Permanent hair coloring products make up the majority of the market worldwide. Significant effort has been directed towards developing various approaches to hair dyeing; these include, oxidative dyes, direct action dyes, natural dyes, metallic dyes and reactive dyes. Many hair coloring formulations, in particular permanent coloring formulations, use reducing agents to break the disulfide bonds in the hair allowing deeper penetration of the hair coloring dyes and bleaching agents into the hair. Disulfide bond linkages in hair are also broken by application of reducing agents, such as during permanent wave and hair straightening process. After the disulfide bonds are broken, the hair is placed in stress to establish the final style (e.g., straight, wavy, or curly), and the disulfide bonds are re-established. Thioglycolic acid, particularly as the ammonium salt, is often used to cleave the cysteine disulfide bonds present in hair. Sodium bisulfite is another example of a known reducing agent commonly used in various dyes and bleaching agents in color treatments. Typically, oxidation to restore the reduced bond is partially obtained when an oxidizing agent, such as hydrogen peroxide is present in a coloring formulation and/or by exposing the hair to atmospheric oxygen. However, this oxidation step can be very slow and can leave the hair frizzy and damaged. Similarly, hair undergoing a permanent wave treatment is typically treated with a reducing agent followed by an oxidizing agent. Hydrogen peroxide is optionally added in a second step to restore the hair to its prior state. The newly formed disulfide bonds of the treated hair are under stress to maintain the hair's new shape; thus, they break easily resulting in a reversion of the hair style over time. The use of peroxides in the hair styling process can result in damaged hair, removal of non-natural color from the hair, and/or leave the hair frizzy. Furthermore, some latent reduced thiols may remain in the hair even after oxidative treatment. Hair styling treatments with peroxides involve the following reaction with thiol groups: 2 K-S-H + H202→ K-S-S-K + 2 H20 ( Reaction I) where K represents keratin in the hair. In the case where two K-S-H groups are not present for Reaction I to take place, it is believed that the following reaction takes place, which results in damaged hair: K-S-H + H202→ K-S02-OH (Reaction II). In addition to being a major component in hair, keratin is also a major component in skin and nails. There are a number of different types of keratin and they are generally grouped as soft or hard keratins. Soft keratins are more prevalent in skin, while hard keratins predominate in hair and nails. Nails, in particular, are made of a modified keratin similar to that found hair. The disulfide bonds of the keratin in nails contribute to their impermeability. Therefore, damage to the disulfide bridges of keratin present in skin or nails can result in unhealthy and/or flaky skin or nails. Maintaining the disulfide bridges of keratin therefore helps to keep skin healthy and prevents cracking and splitting in nails. Substantial improvement is needed in the areas of color saturation, color development, precise initial color consistency, improved wash fastness, and improved hair conditioning when applying color treatments. For example, the attainment of precise initial colors that are retained by the hair for a desirable time period has remained an elusive goal. The coloring formulations also cause severe hair damage, especially when coloring treatments are repeated. Moreover, various standard daily actions to the hair, for example hair brushing, hair blow-drying, and sun light exposure can cause even more damage to the hair. Similar damage to the hair can also result from permanent wave treatments. In both coloring and permanent wave processes, improvements are also needed to repair damage and/or to strengthen the hair during or after such styling treatments. Additionally, improved treatments and methods are needed which can be applied to skin and nails to repair damaged keratin. There is a need for hair formulations and treatments that repair and/or strengthen keratin in hair damaged from coloring and/or permanent wave treatments using reducing treatments. There is also a need for hair formulations and treatments that can repair latent reduced thiols present in hair. There is also a need for formulations and treatments that can repair damage to keratin present in skin and hair. Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide improved formulations and methods for repairing and/or strengthening damaged hair. It is also an object of this invention to provide methods for using formulations that repair and/or strengthen hair after and/or during coloring or permanent wavetreatments. It is also an object of this invention to provide formulations and methods for using these formulations to repair and/or strengthen hair after a reducing treatment. It is also an object of this invention to provide formulations and methods for using these formulations that repair and/or strengthen keratin in hair, skin or nails due to natural wear and tear or due to natural aging. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Formulations, kits, and methods for restoring hair that has been broken during a hair coloring or permanent wave treatment are disclosed. The formulations have similar benefits when used with different color chemical processes, such as bleaching, highlights, lowlights, semipermanent, demi-permanent, and permanent color. Improved methods of styling hair, for example permanent hair waving and hair curling are also provided. The formulations can be applied each time the hair is washed or daily, once-weekly, twice-weekly, biweekly, once-monthly, every other month, or at less frequent intervals. Preferably, the formulations are applied once-monthly to achieve the desired results. Traditional methods of permanent hair waving, hair curling, or straightening use hydrogen peroxide after a reducing treatment. The process generally takes about three days to complete. The methods disclosed herein use active agents to repair the hair; these active agents are washed from the individual's hair on the same day that they are applied to the hair. Under the same conditions, such as temperature and moisture, hair treated with the formulations disclosed herein takes a longer time to revert to its prior state as compared to the same hair that is treated with hydrogen peroxide. The formulations disclosed herein contain one or more polyfunctional compounds. The polyfunctional compound contains at least one ionizable functional group capable of forming ionic bonds, and the polyfunctional compound also contains at least one functional group capable of forming a covalent bond with a thiol group. In some embodiments, the polyfunctional compounds contains at least two ionizable groups. Optionally, the formulation is applied at the same time as the hair coloring or permanent wave treatment. Alternatively, the formulation may be applied after the hair coloring or permanent wave treatment or to damaged hair. For example, the formulations can be applied within one week of the hair being treated and/or damaged, preferably within three days, more preferably within two days, most preferably immediately after application of the coloring or permanent wave treatment.

While greater concentrations of active agent could be present in the highlighting mixture, they are generally not needed to achieve the desired results. III. Methods of Use A. Treatment of hair with coloring agents a. Apply the coloring formulation to the hair The coloring formulation is generally applied to an individual's hair following normal hair coloring procedures that are known to those skilled in the art. Typically, hair color treatments include two complementary processes: applying a bleaching formulation to bleach the hair's natural pigment and/or other artificial pigments present in the hair, and diffusion of dye precursors into the hair, followed by coupling reactions that result in the formation of chromophores within the hair shaft, which are too large to diffuse out of the hair. The bleaching formulation typically contains a bleaching agent to lighten the hair and produce free thiol groups. The hair coloring formulation may be a highlighting formulation, such as formed by mixing bleach powder and developer. More complex colors may contain several precursors and many couplers, and may involve multiple reactions. The dye precursors may contain several ingredients, each with different functions. The first ingredient is usually an alkalizing agent (usually ammonia and/or an ammonia substitute, such as monoethanolamine [MEA]). The alkalizing agent serves a number of roles in the hair colorant process including swelling the hair fiber to aid in diffusion of the dye precursors. The dye precursors generally include ^-diamines and -aminophenols. Precursors are oxidized to active intermediates once they have penetrated the hair shaft. Intermediates then react with color couplers to create wash resistant dyes. More specifically, the intermediates, in the presence of an oxidant, couple with another oxidation dye intermediate molecule to form a large fused ring color compound within the hair shaft. The precursor intermediate should penetrate the hair shaft prior to the coupling reaction since the fused ring product is too large to penetrate the hair shaft. Couplers modify the color produced by the oxidation of precursor compounds. The primary difference between demi-permanent and permanent products is the alkalizing agent and the concentration of peroxide. The cuticle does not swell as greatly with demi-permanent dyes, making dye penetration less efficient compared to permanent coloring products. Several coloring formulations use a reducing agent, such as sodium bisulfate, to break disulfide bonds in the hair, allowing deeper penetration of the hair coloring dyes into the hair. Specifically, the method includes reducing some of the disulfide linkages of the cystine in the hair shafts to thiol groups while breaking hydrogen bonds. The reducing process changes the chemical and cosmetic characteristics of the hair, which are undesirable. The hair dyeing process may be followed by a shampoo and conditioning treatment, a neutralizing rinse or an acid balanced shampoo containing in addition to cationic or amphoteric surfactants, cation-active emollients and quarternary polymers. Alternately, the hair dying process may be followed by application of the active agent formulations described herein, before a shampoo and/or conditioning treatment. b. Apply the active agent formulation to the hair The active agent formulation may be applied simultaneously with the hair coloring formulation or subsequently to the application of the hair coloring formulation. For example, the active agent formulation may be mixed with the hair coloring treatment and the mixture, containing both the active agent and the hair coloring treatment, may be applied to the hair. Alternatively, subsequent to coloring the hair, the active agent formulation, or a formulation thereof is applied to the hair. Although the active agent is typically applied on the same day as the coloring treatment, it may be applied later such as within 1 to 2 weeks following treatment with the reducing agent. Typically, the amount of active agent formulation (or a mixture of the active agent formulation and the hair coloring formulation) applied is sufficient to saturate the hair. The active agent may be applied to the hair as a single application, or application of the active agent may be repeated one or more times. Typically, the amount of active agent formulation applied in each application is sufficient to saturate the hair. The volume of active agent formulation applied to the hair in each application may be about 1 to about 100 mL per person depending on their length and volume of hair. In some embodiments, application of the active agent could be repeated immediately (e.g. within 10 to 15 seconds) or approximately 1, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, or 20 minutes after the first application. The active agent can be rinsed and shampooed from the hair immediately following application, for example within 10, 15, 25, 30, 45, or 60 seconds, or two, three, four, or five minutes after application. Alternatively, the active agent may be rinsed from the hair within about 30 minutes following application, preferably between about 5 minutes and about 20 minutes, more preferably about 10 minutes after application of the active agent to the hair, depending on hair type. If the active agent formulation is combined with the hair coloring treatment and applied as a mixture to the hair, then the mixture remains on the hair as long as needed for the hair coloring treatment. Typically the mixture is applied for approximately 10 minutes. The mixture is removed from the hair in accordance with standard methods for hair coloring treatments, e.g., rinse and shampoo, approximately 10 minutes after applying the mixture. The active agent formulation is rinsed from the hair after its application. The hair may be rinsed and subsequently washed immediately (e.g. within 10 to 15 seconds following application) after the final application of the active agent. Preferably, the hair is rinsed and/or washed about 10 minutes or later after the final application of the active agent, such as about 15 minutes to about 30 minutes, optionally about 20 minutes after repeated application of the active agent to the hair. The active agents are generally washed from the individual's hair on the same day as they are applied. In contrast, traditional perms which use only hydrogen peroxide (and do not involve the addition of the active agent) are generally not washed for at least 48 hours following application (washing the hair prior to 48 hours following a traditional permanent treatment may result in significant loss in the amount of curl in the hair and/or cause damage to the hair). The formulation described herein improves hair quality, such as appearance (e.g., sheen) and feel, and decreases hair breakage when the hair is subjected to treatments, such as coloring or permanent waving. In some embodiments, hair breakage decreases by 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50% or higher after treatment with the active agent compared to untreated hair from the same individual. Hair breakage is a significant problem encountered during coloring and other treatments. B. Chemical treatment of hair with a reducing agent In one embodiment, prior to treatment with the active agent, the hair has been subjected to a reducing agent used for waving (also referred to herein as hair perming or permanent waves), and/or curling of the hair, a. Apply a reducing agent to the hair The first step in waving or curling hair is breaking the cysteine disulfide bonds to form free thiol moieties. The process for breaking the cysteine disulfide bonds is via application of a reducing agent. The process for applying the reducing agent involves following normal perming or hair straightening procedures that are known to those skilled in the art. For example, to perm hair, the hair is first washed and set on perm rods of various sizes. Second, a reducing agent, such as thioglycolate reducing solution or lotion is applied to the hair. The hair is allowed to set for a specified period of time, and then the thioglycolate solution is rinsed from the hair. The application of hydrogen peroxide in this process is optional. In some processes, such as when treating previously chemically treated hair, hydrogen peroxide is generally not used. In other processes, such as when perming virgin hair, hydrogen peroxide may be added. In these embodiments, hydrogen peroxide is typically added after the reducing agent is rinsed out. Then the hydrogen peroxide is rinsed from the hair prior to adding the active agent. b. Apply the active agent Subsequent to the reducing treatment, one or more of the active agent, or a formulation thereof is applied to the hair. Although the agent is typically applied on the same day as treatment with the reducing agent, it may be applied later such as within 1 to 2 weeks following treatment with the reducing agent. Typically, the amount of active agent formulation applied is sufficient to saturate the hair. The agent is generally rinsed and shampooed from the hair after the desired level of hair waving or curling is achieved. In some embodiments, the active agent is rinsed from the hair immediately (e.g. within 10, 15, 25, 30, 45, or 60 seconds following application) following the final application of the active agent. Alternatively the hair may be rinsed and washed about within about 30 minutes following application, preferably between about 5 minutes and about 20 minutes, more preferably about 10 minutes after the final application of the active agent to the hair, depending on the hair type. The active agent can be rinsed from the hair within 10, 15, 25, 30, 45, 60 seconds from the hair after application, and still achieve a desired level of hair waving or curling. The active agent may be applied to the hair as a single application, or application of the agent may be repeated one or more times. Typically, the amount of active agent formulation applied in each application is sufficient to saturate the hair. In some embodiments, the volume of active agent formulation applied to the hair in each application is about 1 to about 10 mL per perm rod. In some embodiments, application of the active agent could be repeated immediately (e.g. within 10 to 15 seconds) or approximately 1, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5, or 20 minutes after the first application. In some embodiments, the second application is about 7 minutes to about 10 minutes after the first application. The active agent is rinsed from the hair after its application. The hair may be rinsed and washed immediately (e.g. within 10 to 15 seconds following application) after final application of the active agent. Alternatively the hair may be rinsed and washed about 10 minutes or later after the final application of the active agent, such as about 15 minutes to about 30 minutes, preferably about 20 minutes after repeated application of the active agent to the hair. The active agents are generally washed from the individual's hair on the same day as they are applied. In contrast, traditional perms which use only hydrogen peroxide (and do not involve the addition of the active agent) are generally not washed for at least 48 hours following application (washing the hair prior to 48 hours following a traditional permanent treatment may result in significant loss in the amount of curl in the hair and/or cause damage to the hair). The formulations described herein can be applied to hair to improve hair quality, such as appearance (e.g., sheen) and feel, and decrease hair breakage when the hair is subjected to subsequent treatments, such as coloring. In some embodiments, hair breakage decreases by 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or 50% or higher after application of the active agent compared to untreated hair from the same individual. Hair breakage is a significant problem encountered during coloring and other treatments. C. Treatment of skin or nails with the active agent In one embodiment, a formulation containing one or more of the active agents is applied to the skin or nails. Application of the active agent formulation to skin or nails can help repair damaged disulfide bonds due to natural wear and tear or natural aging. In some embodiments the active agent formulation is in the form of a cream or lotion, which is suitable for application to the skin or nails. In other embodiments, the active agent formulation is in the form of a gel or polish, which is suitable for application to the nails. Typically, the amount of active agent formulation applied is sufficient to treat the damaged keratin in the skin or nails. The active agent formulation may be applied to the skin or nails in a single application, or application of the formulation may be repeated one or more times, as needed, to achieve the desired effect of repairing keratin damage and/or strengthening the skin or nails. IV. Kit Kits for treating hair are provided. In one embodiment, the kit typically contains a first formulation for coloring hair. The hair coloring formulations typically include a reducing agent capable of reducing disulfide bonds in hair to produce free thiol groups. The kit also includes a second formulation containing an effective amount of the active agent. The kit may further include a developer bottle, gloves, shampoo, conditioner, and/or an odor eliminator. Instructions for use of the kit are also typically provided. Typically the kit contains more than one container (or more than one compartment in a given container) to ensure that the lightening agent (e.g. , peroxides) or the coloring agent is stored separately from the active agent. a. First Formulation The first formulation in the kit can be a coloring treatment. The first formulation may be formulated as two or more components which may be mixed together before application to the hair. For example, the first formulation may be in the form of two components such as a dye precursor and an oxidant. Typically, the hair coloring formulation contains a reducing agent capable of reducing the disulfide bonds in hair and producing reduced free thiol groups. Suitable reducing agents include, but are not limited to, thioglycolic acid, thiolactic acid, dihydrolipoate, thioglycerol, mercaptopropionic acid, sodium bisulfite, ammonium bisulfide, zinc formaldehyde sulfoxylate, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, sodium metabisulfite, potassium borohydride, pegylated thiols and hydroquinone. The amount of the reducing agent in the first formulation is sufficient to rupture a sufficient number of disulfide bonds for effective diffusion of the hair coloring ingredients as would be appreciated by one of skill in the art. The components of the first formulation may differ depending on the hair coloring treatment desired (such as for semi-permanent, demi- permanent, or permanent hair color), the texture of the hair, the sensitivity of the user's skin, and such the like. Hair coloring formulations for different hair coloring treatment, hair texture, and hair sensitivity are known to those of skill in the art. b.

The samples were then colored with the L'Oreal® permanent hair color service, which was left on the hair samples for approximately 35-40 minutes. The first color treated hair sample ("control") was subsequently rinsed and washed with Liqwd® Hydrating Shampoo and Conditioner five times before being photographed. The active agent formulation was applied to the second and third color treated hair samples via a spray bottle and massaging using the fingers. The active agent formulation was left on the second hair sample for a period of about 1 minute and on the third sample for a period of about 10 minutes. The hair samples were subsequently rinsed, and then washed with Liqwd® Hydrating Shampoo and Conditioner five times before being examined. Results: The hair samples treated with the active agent formulation showed better color retention, more shine, and less frizz than the control. The hair samples treated with the active agent formulation felt smoother to the touch and combined with the lower frizz and added sheen gave an overall healthier appearance over the control. Example 2: Comparison of color retention in traditionally permed hair and hair permed using the active agent formulations. Method A ½ inch wide weft of hair sample, obtained from a human subject, was washed with clarifying shampoo then towel dried. Ammonium thioglycolate or dithiothreitol was mechanically pulled through the hair with a wide and a fine toothcomb several times then left on the hair for 10 minutes to 1 hour. The hair was then rinsed for 30 seconds to 1 minute with water, and then towel dried. The active agent formulation, described in Example 1 (Maleic acid in water), was then applied via a needle nose applicator drenching the hair and leaving it on for 7.5 minutes. This step was repeated, for a total of 15 minutes. The hair was then rinsed for 1-2 minutes, shampooed, and then conditioned with various salon shampoo and conditioner brands, including LiQWd® Hydrating Shampoo and Hydrating Conditioner. A second sample of hair was straightened, as described above, but using hydrogen peroxide instead of the active agent formulation. The hair samples were washed and conditioned repeatedly. Comparison of hair color. After both hair samples were washed five times using LiQWd® Hydrating Shampoo and LiQWd® Hydrating Conditioner, the samples were examined for their color retention. Results The hair sample treated with the active agent formulation displayed a color closer in intensity to the hair sample prior to the first washing, compared to the hair treated with hydrogen peroxide. Example 3: Comparison of hair treated with highlighting formulation applied simultaneously with active agent formulation and hair treated with highlighting formulation alone The active agent formulation in Example 1 contained maleic acid at concentrations of 2.0 g in 10 g total solution (water). Two swatches of human hair were tested. A sample was taken from the same head, 1 inch wide, and split in half. The color was medium brown and had been previously color treated with an unknown professional hair color. Swatch 1, 1/2 inch wide and 8 inches long, was lightened with traditional highlighting ingredients mixed with the active agent formulation. loz of Joico Verocolor Veroxide developer-20 volume was mixed with loz Joico Verolight powder bleach to form the highlighting formulation. Then 9mL of the active agent formulation was added to the highlighting formulation to form a mixture. The mixture was applied on the Swatch 1 hair with an applicator brush as the hair lay on aluminum foil. The foil was then wrapped around the swatch and allowed to process for 35 minutes. The swatch was rinsed and shampooed one time. Swatch 2, the control, 1/2 inch wide and 8 inches long, was lightened with traditional highlighting ingredients in the absence of the active agent formulation. 1 oz of Joico Verocolor Veroxide developer-20 volume was mixed with loz Joico Verolight powder bleach to form a highlighting formulation with a creamy consistency. The highlighting formulation was applied on the Swatch 2 hair with an applicator brush as the hair lay on aluminum foil. The foil was then wrapped around the swatch and allowed to process for 35 minutes. The swatch was rinsed and shampooed one time. Results A noticeable difference in hair quality between Swatch 1 and Swatch 2 was observed. Swatch 1 hair was softer, less frizzy, appeared hydrated, with more shine than the control, Swatch 2. Both swatches were washed and conditioned 5 more times with the same noticeable benefits of Swatch 1 (treated with the mixture of highlighting formulation and active agent formulation) compared to the control, Swatch 2 (treated with highlighting formulation, alone). Example 4: Comparison of hair treated with bleaching formulation applied simultaneously with active agent formulation and hair treated with bleaching formulation alone General Two hair samples were obtained from a human subject and cut in ½ inch wide wefts. Methods (1) 0.5 ounces of powder lightener (Clairol Professional, Basic White) and 0.5 ounces of conditioning cream developer (Redken, Blonde Icing) were combined to form a bleaching mixture. 3.5 g of 2- (methacryloyloxy)ethan-l-aminium (Z)-3-carboxyacrylate (12 wt % in water) was added to the bleaching mixture and thoroughly mixed with a brush. (2) The bleaching mixture prepared was brushed onto the swatches of hair with a brush in order to thoroughly coat the strands of hair. The mixture coated hair was wrapped in aluminum paper and allowed to stand under ambient conditions for a period of two hours. (3) After the two hour bleaching period the swatches of hair were washed with shampoo and the hair was subsequently allowed to air dry. Results A noticeable difference in hair quality between Swatch 1 and Swatch 2 was observed. Swatch 1 hair was demonstrated no discernible breakage, great feel, and a healthy appearance while the control (treated with bleaching formulation, alone) showed some breakage, had a rough feel, and was frayed with an unhealthy appearance. Example 5: Comparison of hair treated with bleaching formulation applied simultaneously with active agent formulation and hair treated with bleaching formulation alone General Two hair samples were obtained from a human subject and cut in ½ inch wide wefts. Methods (1) 0.5 ounces of powder lightener (Clairol Professional, Basic White) and 0.5 ounces of conditioning cream developer (Redken, Blonde Icing) were combined to form a bleaching mixture. 3.5 g of prop-2-en-l- aminium (Z)-3-carboxyacrylate (10 wt% in water) was added to the bleaching mixture and thoroughly mixed with a brush. (2) The bleaching mixture prepared was brushed onto the swatches of hair with a brush in order to thoroughly coat the strands of hair. The mixture coated hair was wrapped in aluminum paper and allowed to stand under ambient conditions for a period of two hours. (3) After the two hour bleaching period the swatches of hair were washed with shampoo and the hair was subsequently allowed to air dry. Results A noticeable difference in hair quality between Swatch 1 and Swatch 2 was observed. Swatch 1 hair was demonstrated no discernible breakage, great feel, and a healthy appearance while the control (treated with bleaching formulation, alone) showed some breakage, had a rough feel, and was frayed with an unhealthy appearance. Example 6: Comparison of traditional perm versus perm using maleic acid General Hair samples were obtained from a human subject and cut in ½ inch wide wefts. Reducing agents: Ammonium thioglycolate (ATG) was obtained from a permanent wave kit manufactured by Zotos. 300 mg of Dithiothreitol in a lOg solution was also used as the reducing agent. Active agent formulation: Maleic acid at a concentration of 200 mg in 10 g total solution (water) was used. Methods Method for perming hair using the active agent The hair was washed with clarifying shampoo, towel dried, and then rolled around a perm rod. Ammonium thioglycolate or dithiothreitol was then applied to the hair and left on the hair for 10 minutes to 1 hour. The hair was then rinsed for 30 seconds to 1 minute and then blotted dry with a towel. The active agent formulation was applied to the hair, via a needle nose applicator, drenching the hair. The active agent formulation was left on the hair for a period of about 7.5 minutes. The hair was drenched for a second time with the active agent formulation and left for a second 7.5 minutes, for a total of 15 minutes. The hair was then rinsed with water for about 1-2 minutes then unrolled from the perm rods. After the hair was removed from the perm rods, the hair was shampooed and conditioned with various salon shampoo and conditioner brands, including LiQWd® Hydrating Shampoo and Hydrating Conditioner. The washing and drying steps were repeated 40 times. A second portion of hair was permed as described above, except, hydrogen peroxide was used instead of the active agent formulation. Results Both perms (utilizing the active agent formulation or hydrogen peroxide) showed only slight reduction in the overall curl after 40 cycles of washing and drying with the same shampoo and conditioner. However, the appearance and texture of the perm using the active agent formulation showed more sheen and less frizz compared to the perm using hydrogen peroxide. Example 7: Comparison of hair breakage due to repeated application of traditional perm and the active agent formulation. Methods Two hair samples were obtained. Both samples were treated with dithiothreitol or ammonium thioglycolate as described in Example 4. One of the hair samples was subsequently treated with the active agent formulation (Maleic acid in water), while the other was neutralized with hydrogen peroxide. The process was completed the same day for the hair treated with the active agent formulation. The process was completed in three days with hydrogen peroxide (traditional perm). The procedure was repeated three times for each hair sample over a 48 hour time period. Results Upon visual inspections, the second hair sample treated with the active agent formulation showed little or no signs of breakage. However, the first hair sample treated with hydrogen peroxide showed significant breakage. Example 8: Comparison of the extent of damage to hair previously relaxed with a Japanese relaxer Methods Two samples of hair, the first previously straightened with a Japanese relaxer (Yuko), and the second previously straightened with a no lye relaxer (African Pride Miracle Deep Conditioning) were obtained. The samples were treated as described in Examples 4 and 5 using the active agent formulation (Maleic acid in water). Another hair sample, previously straightened with a no lye relaxer (African Pride Miracle Deep Conditioning) was obtained. The sample was treated with a traditional hair straightening perm (Zotos). Results The hair samples treated with the active agent formulation showed no noticeable damage. However, the sample treated with a traditional perm showed significant breaking, even during application. 1.
