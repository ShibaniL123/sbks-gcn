BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing a game program and an information processing device. 2. Description of Related Art Game systems allowing a player in receipt of a request for support for another player to give the player a reinforcement point have been known (for example, JP 2013-52285 A). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION With such a game system, the number of supports for another player is limited because the game balance will be lost as a result of points given in excess if unlimited supports for another player are permitted. This reduces the players' incentive to support other players, and does not encourage the players to fully communicate with one another. The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing, and an objective is to stimulate communication between players. A principal invention of the present invention to solve the aforementioned problems is a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing game program causing a computer to execute: a recording process of recording a lottery point and a play point in association with each player in a storage unit; a lottery process of, upon receiving a content request from a player, consuming the lottery point associated with the player, and executing a lottery game for giving a game content selected from multiple game contents to the player; a support process of, upon receiving a support request for supporting a first player playing the lottery game by a second player, giving a lottery point to the first player and the second player without consuming a play point associated with the second player; a special support process of, upon receiving a special support request for supporting a first player playing the lottery game by a second player, consuming a play point associated with the second player and giving a lottery point to the first player and the second player; and a number-of-executions control process of limiting the number of executions of the support process to a predetermined number or smaller and permitting execution of the special support process a number of times larger than the predetermined number. Other features of the present invention will be apparent from the description of the present specification and the appended drawings.

The game system 1 provides various games conducted by using electronic game cards (virtual cards used in games) associated with game characters. <Battle Game> In the game system 1 of the present embodiment, a player can possess multiple game cards. The player can play a battle game by using a game card (player character) selected from the game cards that the player possesses. Specifically, the battle processing unit 113A determines an opponent character that is an opponent of the player character, and determines an outcome of a battle game between these characters on the basis of various parameters (attack strength, defense strength, hit point, and the like) set for the respective characters. <Lottery Game> With the game system 1 of the present embodiment, a target hitting game that is an example of a lottery game to give a game card to a player is conducted. In the target hitting game, one lottery is conducted when a player throws (consumes) one or nine balls to game cards placed in the card placement area divided into 3×3=9 squares (unit areas), and one game card or all of nine game cards in the card placement area are given to the player. In the target hitting game of the present embodiment, each player is provided with a plurality of decks each composed of one set of 1200 game cards. After a game card is given to a player and the number of cards in the card placement area decreases as a result of the target hitting game, a game card selected in numerical order from a deck is supplied into the card placement area. When the number of game cards in the deck decreases and becomes insufficient as a result of repeated supply of game cards, the deck is replaced with the next new deck. The game system 1 can thus constantly provide a player with the target hitting game. In the target hitting game of the present embodiment, a special card (a “super rare” card, for example) may be placed when a game card is supplied to the card placement area. The player can try the target hitting game in an attempt to acquire the special card. <Support, Special Support> With the game system 1 of the present embodiment, a player (hereinafter also referred to as a “supporting player” (second player)) can support or specially support a player (hereinafter also referred to as a “supported player” (first player)) trying the target hitting game in an attempt to acquire a special card. The players can communicate with one another through the support or the special support. In the present embodiment, a supporting player can support a supported player only once without consuming the virtual currency. When a supporting player supports a supported player, one ball is given to each of the supported player and the supporting player. The players can play the target hitting game described above by using the given balls. A supporting player can also specially support a supported player by consuming the virtual currency. When a supporting player supports a supported player, three balls are given to each of the supported player and the supporting player. Note that the supporting player may consume an amount of virtual currency (10 coins, for example) that is smaller than the amount of virtual currency (30 coins, for example) consumed for a special support to support a supported player. Furthermore, in the present embodiment, the number of times of support is limited to one but the number of times of special support is up to ten. Thus, a supporting player can specially support a supported player by consuming the virtual currency although the support for the supported player is limited, which can stimulate communication between players. If a supported player succeeds in acquiring a special card in the target hitting game as a result of special support by a supporting player, a special item is given to the supporting player as a reward. <Acquisition Game> With the game system 1 of the present embodiment, an acquisition game allowing a player to acquire a ball to be used in the target hitting game is conducted. In the acquisition game, a player can acquire one ball if he/she succeeds in catching a predetermined character (game card) encountered during the game. For catching a predetermined character, a player can use a predetermined item. A player can catch a predetermined item without fail by using a predetermined item. In this manner, a player can acquire balls not only by the support or the special support described above but also by playing the acquisition game. <<Operation of Game System 1>> Here, an example of operation of the game system 1 according to the present embodiment will be described. With the game system 1 of the present embodiment, operation on the target hitting game, operation on the support or the special support, and operation on the acquisition game are performed. Hereinafter, the operations will be described more specifically. <Operation on Target Hitting Game> FIG. 12 is a flowchart for explaining an example of the operation of the target hitting game in the game system 1 according to the present embodiment. First, in a player terminal 20, upon receiving an operation input made by a player from the terminal input unit 23, the terminal control unit 21 transmits a command (target hitting game start page request) for acquiring a start page (game screen) of the target hitting game to the server device 10 via the terminal communication unit 25 (S101). Subsequently, upon receiving the target hitting game start page request transmitted from the player terminal 20, the server device 10 executes a card placement process of placing game cards in respective unit areas of the card placement area (S102). Specifically, the placement unit 111 places game cards in the card placement area set for the player on the basis of the player information (see FIG. 6) and the card placement information (see FIG. 10) stored in the storage unit 12. Subsequently, the server device 10 causes the screen data generation unit 119 to generate screen data (HTML file) for displaying the start page (web page) of the target hitting game on the player terminal 20 (S103). The screen data generation unit 119 generates screen data of the start page containing the card placement area in which game cards are placed by the placement unit 111. The server device 10 then transmits the thus generated screen data (HTML file) corresponding to the start page of the target hitting game to the requesting player terminal 20 via the network (S104). Subsequently, upon receiving the screen data (HTML data) transmitted from the server device 10, the player terminal 20 analyzes the screen data to display the start page (web page) of the target hitting game on the terminal display unit 24 (S105). FIG. 13 is a diagram illustrating an example of a game screen 50 (start page 50) for the target hitting game displayed on the terminal display unit 24. The start page 50 contains the card placement area 51, an operation button 52 for throwing one ball, and an operation button 53 for throwing nine balls at once. Herein, a super rare card 51A that is an example of the special card is placed in the card placement area 51. Furthermore, a frame area 51B is provided around the card placement area 51. Subsequently, referring back to FIG. 12, when the operation button 52 or the operation button 53 is selected by the player while the start page 50 of the target hitting game illustrated in FIG. 13 is displayed on the terminal display unit 24, the terminal control unit 21 of the player terminal 20 transmits a command (card request) requesting to give a card on the basis of this operation information to the server device 10 via the terminal communication unit 25 (S106). Subsequently, upon receiving the card request transmitted from the player terminal 20, the server device 10 executes a lottery process through the target hitting game for giving a game card to the player (S107). Specifically, the lottery processing unit 113B determines whether or not a super rare card 51A (special card) is placed in the card placement area 51 on the basis of the card placement information (see FIG. 10) of the player. If no super rare card 51A is placed in the card placement area 51, the lottery processing unit 113B permits operational input with the operation button 52 and the operation button 53, consumes one or nine balls (see FIG. 6) possessed by the player, and gives one game card selected from the game cards placed in the card placement area 51 or all of the nine game cards to the player. If, on the other hand, a super rare card 51A is placed in the card placement area 51, the lottery processing unit 113B permits only operational input with the operation button 52, consumes one ball (see FIG. 6) possessed by the player, and gives one game card selected from the game cards placed in the card placement area 51 to the player. This is because, the player can easily acquire the super rare card 51A if operational input with the operation button 53 is permitted and all of the nine game cards are given. After game cards are given to the player in this manner, the possessed card information illustrated in FIG. 7 is updated. In the lottery process through the target hitting game, the rarities of game cards are weighted so that the probability with which a game card is selected varies depending on the rarity. For example, if a super rare card (special card) is placed in only one square out of nine squares and uncommon cards are placed in the remaining eight squares, the lottery processing unit 113B sets the weight on the super rare card to 1 and the weight on the uncommon cards to 10 so that the probability with which the super rare card is selected is set to 1/81 and the probability with which each uncommon card is selected to 10/81. This prevents the super rare card and the uncommon cards from being selected with an equal probability of 1/9. Furthermore, in the lottery process through the target hitting game, if any super rare card 51A (special card) is placed in the card placement area 51, the period of time during which the super rare card 51A is placed in the card placement area 51 is limited. Specifically, the placement unit 111 starts counting the time elapsed when the super rare card 51A is placed in the card placement area 51 (starts counting the time elapsed when the card placement information illustrated in FIG. 10 is updated), and performs control so that the super rare card 51A is not placed in the card placement area 51 (so that the square in which the super rare card 51A is placed is emptied) when a preset time limit (15 minutes, for example) elapsed. Subsequently, the placement unit 111 places a new game card selected from the deck in the square in place of the super rare card 51A. Furthermore, in the lottery process through the target hitting game, if it is determined to give the super rare card 51A (special card) to the player (supported player) as a result of the lottery, a special item is given as a reward to another player (supporting player) who specially supported the player. Specifically, the lottery processing unit 113B refers to the player information illustrated in FIG. 6 and the support log information illustrated in FIG. 11 to identify the player who specially supported the supported player and give the special item selected from the item information illustrated in FIG. 5. After the special item is thus given, the possessed item information illustrated in FIG. 8 is updated. Subsequently, when the game card to be given to the player is determined as a result of executing the lottery process, the server device 10 causes the screen data generation unit 119 to generate screen data presenting the result of the target hitting game (S108). The server device 10 then transmits the screen data generated by the screen data generation unit 119 to the requesting player terminal 20 via the network 2 (S109). Subsequently, upon receiving the screen data (HTML data) transmitted from the server device 10, the player terminal 20 analyzes the screen data to display the game screen (web page) presenting the result of the target hitting game on the terminal display unit 24 (S110). The player can see the game card given as a result of the target hitting game by looking at the game screen displayed on the terminal display unit 24. <Operation on Support/Special Support> FIG. 14 is a flowchart for explaining an example of the operation of the support and the special support in the game system 1 according to the present embodiment. First, in a player terminal 20, upon receiving an operation input made by a supporting player from the terminal input unit 23, the terminal control unit 21 transmits a command (list request) for acquiring a list of supported players to the server device 10 via the terminal communication unit 25 (S201). Subsequently, upon receiving the list request transmitted from the player terminal 20, the server device 10 executes a list generation process of generating a list of supported players trying the target hitting game in an attempt to acquire a super rare card 51A (special card) (S202). Specifically, the control unit 11 refers to the player information illustrated in FIG. 6 and the card placement information illustrated in FIG. 10 to extract and list supported players associated with the card placement area 51 in which the super rare card 51A is placed (players trying the target hitting game in an attempt to acquire the super rare card 51A). Subsequently, the server device 10 causes the screen data generation unit 119 to generate screen data (HTML file) for displaying the game screen (web page) containing the generated list of supported players on the player terminal 20 (S203). The server device 10 transmits the thus generated screen data (HTML file) corresponding to the thus generated game screen (web page) to the requesting player terminal 20 via the network (S204). Subsequently, upon receiving the screen data (HTML data) transmitted from the server device 10, the player terminal 20 analyzes the screen data to display the game screen containing the list of supported players on the terminal display unit 24 (S205). FIG. 15 is a diagram illustrating an example of a game screen 60 containing the list of supported players. The game screen 60 displays the list of supported players trying to acquire the super rare card 51A. The game screen 60 also displays the remaining time before the super rare card 51A is deleted from the card placement area 51 (the remaining time before the preset time limit (15 minutes) is reached) and an operation button 61 for viewing the card placement area 51 from which the supported player is trying to acquire the super rare card 51A in association with each supported player trying to acquire the super rare card 51A. Subsequently, when an operation button 61 associated with a supported player to be viewed is selected from the list while the game screen 60 illustrated in FIG. 15 is displayed on the terminal display unit 24, the terminal control unit 21 of the player terminal 20 transmits a command (viewing request) for viewing the card placement area 51 (the card placement area in which game cards that are candidates for the lottery in the target hitting game are placed) associated with the supported player trying to acquire the super rare card 51A to the server device 10 via the terminal communication unit 25 (S206). Subsequently, upon receiving the viewing request transmitted from the player terminal 20, the server device 10 executes a process of checking whether or not the card placement area 51 of the supported player to be viewed can be viewed (S207). Specifically, the control unit 11 refers to the player information illustrated in FIG. 6 and the card placement information illustrated in FIG. 10 to determine whether or not the super rare card 51A is placed in the card placement area 51 of the supported player to be viewed (whether or not the super rare card 51A is already acquired). If the super rare card 51A is already acquired, the card placement area 51 cannot be viewed. The control unit 11 further determines whether or not the remaining time before the super rare card 51A is deleted from the card placement area 51 is 0 minutes (that is, whether or not the time elapsed since the super rare card 51A is placed in the card placement area 51 has reached the preset time limit (15 minutes)). If the remaining time is 0 minutes, the card placement area 51 cannot be viewed. Subsequently, if it is determined in the checking process in S207 that the card placement area 51 of the supported player to be viewed can be viewed, the server device 10 executes a process of checking the number of times of the special support for the supported player to be viewed (that is, a player trying the target hitting game in an attempt to acquire the super rare card 51A) (S208). Specifically, the control unit 11 refers to the player information illustrated in FIG. 6 to obtain the number of times of the special support for the supported player trying to acquire the super rare card 51A by another player (supporting player). Subsequently, the server device 10 executes a card placement process of placing game cards in the card placement area 51 for the supported player to be viewed (S209). Specifically, the placement unit 111 refers to the player information illustrated in FIG. 6 and the card placement information illustrated in FIG. 10 to place game cards in the card placement area 51 for the supported player to be viewed. Subsequently, the server device 10 causes the screen data generation unit 119 to generate screen data (HTML file) for displaying a game screen (web page) containing the card placement area 51 for the supported player to be viewed on the player terminal 20 (S210). The screen data generation unit 119 generates screen data of the game screen for viewing containing the card placement area 51 in which game cards are placed by the placement unit 111. In this process, the screen data generation unit 119 changes the display state of the frame area 51B displayed around the card placement are 51 according to the number of times of special support obtained as a result of the checking process in S208. For example, the screen data generation unit 119 changes the display color of the frame area 51B in the order of white→yellow→red→silver→gold as the number of times of the special support increases. In this manner, the supported player can make the display of the card placement area 51 louder to emphasize the card placement area 51 as a result of the special support of the supporting player. In the meantime, the supporting player is appreciated by the supported player and can expect special support by the supported player when the supporting player in turn tries the target hitting game (support in return). As a result, the players support one another, which further stimulate communication. Note that the screen data generation unit 119 need not gradually change the display state of the frame area 51B with the increase in the number of times of special support but may change the display state of the frame area 51B when the viewing request is for viewing the card placement area 51 of a supported player that has ever been specially supported (that has been specially supported at least once). The server device 10 then transmits the thus generated screen data (HTML file) corresponding to the game screen for viewing to the requesting player terminal 20 via the network (S211). Subsequently, upon receiving the screen data (HTML data) transmitted from the server device 10, the player terminal 20 analyzes the screen data to display the game screen for viewing on the terminal display unit 24 (S212). FIG. 16 is a diagram illustrating an example of a game screen 70 for viewing displayed on the terminal display unit 24. The game screen 70 for viewing contains the card placement area 51 of the supported player to be viewed (that is, the player trying the target hitting game in an attempt to acquire the super rare card 51A), an operation button 71 for supporting the supported player trying the target hitting game, and an operation button 72 for specially supporting the supported player trying the target hitting game. If the operation button 71 is selected by the supporting player, a support process for supporting the supported player trying the target hitting game will be executed without consuming coins (virtual currency). If the operation button 72 is selected by the supporting player, a special support process for specially supporting the supported player trying the target hitting game will be executed by consuming 30 coins (virtual currency). Subsequently, if the operation button 71 is selected by the supporting player while the game screen 70 illustrated in FIG. 16 is displayed on the terminal display unit 24, the terminal control unit 21 of the player terminal 20 transmits a command (support request) requesting to support the supported player trying the target hitting game by the supporting player to the server device 10. If the operation button 72 is selected by the supporting player, the terminal control unit 21 transmits a command (special support request) requesting to specially support the supported player trying the target hitting game by the supporting player to the server device 10 (S213). Subsequently, upon receiving the support request or the special support request transmitted from the player terminal 20, the server device 10 executes a number-of-executions control process (S214). Subsequently, upon receiving a support request for supporting the supported player trying the target hitting game by the supporting player, the number-of-executions control unit 116 refers to the player information illustrated in FIG. 6 to obtain the number of times of support of the supporting player for other players. The number-of-executions control unit 116 limits execution of the support process by the support processing unit 114 if the obtained number is determined to be larger than one (a predetermined number set in advance), and permits execution of the support process if the obtained number is equal to or smaller than one. Furthermore, upon receiving a special support request for specially supporting the supported player trying the target hitting game by the supporting player, the number-of-executions control unit 116 refers to the player information illustrated in FIG. 6 to obtain the number of times of special support of the supporting player for other players. The number-of-executions control unit 116 limits execution of the special support process by the special support processing unit 115 if the obtained number is determined to be larger than ten (a predetermined number set in advance), and permits execution of the special support process if the obtained number is equal to or smaller than ten. Subsequently, when the support or the special support of the supporting player for the supported player trying the target hitting game is permitted as a resulting of executing the number-or-executions control process, the server device 10 executes a support or special support process (S215). Specifically, the support processing unit 114 gives one ball to the supported player and the supporting player without consuming the virtual currency of the supporting player, and updates the player information (see FIG. 6) of each of the players. In this process, the count processing unit 117 counts the number of times of support of the supporting player for other players (supported players) and the number of times of support of other players (supporting players) for the supported player, and updates the player information (see FIG. 6) of each of the players. The special support processing unit 115 consumes 30 coins (30 points) of the virtual currency possessed by the supporting player, gives three balls to the supported player and the supporting player, and updates the player information (see FIG. 6) of each of the players. In this process, the count processing unit 117 counts the number of times of special support of the supporting player for other players (supported players) and the number of times of special support of other players (supporting players) for the supported player, and updates the player information (see FIG. 6) of each of the players. Subsequently, after the predetermined number of balls are given to the player as a result of executing the support or special support process, the server device 10 causes the screen data generation unit 119 to generate screen data presenting the result of the support or special support (S216). The server device 10 then transmits the screen data generated by the screen data generation unit 119 to the requesting player terminal 20 via the network 2 (S217). Subsequently, upon receiving the screen data (HTML data) transmitted from the server device 10, the player terminal 20 analyzes the screen data to display the game screen (web page) presenting the result of the support or special support on the terminal display unit 24 (S218). The supporting player can confirm that the predetermined number of balls are given as a result of the support or special support by looking at the game screen displayed on the terminal display unit 24. <Operation on Acquisition Game> Here, an example of operation of the acquisition game in the game system 1 according to the present embodiment will be described. Upon receiving a game start request transmitted from the player terminal 20, the server device 10 executes an acquisition game process. Specifically, the acquisition game processing unit 113C determines whether or not to cause a predetermined character (predetermined game card) to appear for the player. When it is determined to cause the predetermined character to appear by the acquisition game processing unit 113C, the screen data generation unit 119 generates screen data for displaying a game screen (web page) presenting encounter with the predetermined character on the player terminal 20. FIG. 17 is a diagram illustrating an example of a game screen 80 (a game screen presenting encounter with a predetermined character) of the acquisition game. The game screen 80 contains information indicating the appearing predetermined character (“character F”), and operation buttons 81 and 82 for catching the appearing character. When the operation button 81 or 82 is selected by the player while the game screen 80 illustrated in FIG. 17 is displayed on the terminal display unit 24, the player terminal 20 transmits a command (catching request) requesting to catch the “character F” to the server device 10. Upon receiving the catching request transmitted from the player terminal 20, the server device 10 executes a process of determining whether the result of catching of the “character F” is a success or a failure. Specifically, if the operation button 81 is selected by the player, the acquisition game processing unit 113C determines the result of catching the “character F” to be a success or a failure with a predetermined probability without consuming a predetermined item possessed by the player. If the operation button 82 is selected by the player, the acquisition game processing unit 113C determines the result of catching the “character F” to be a success with a probability of 100% by consuming the predetermined item (item A) possessed by the player (that is, the result of catching the “character F” is always a success by using the predetermined item) on the basis of the possessed item information illustrated in FIG. 8. Note that the predetermined item is an item that the player can purchase by consuming 100 coins of the virtual currency. Specifically, upon receiving an exchange request (purchase request) from the player, the exchange processing unit 118 executes an exchange process of exchanging the virtual currency (100 coins) possessed by the player for the predetermined item (item A) on the basis of the player information illustrated in FIG. 6. If the result of catching the “character F” is determined to be a success, the acquisition game processing unit 113C then gives one ball to the player and updates the player information (see FIG. 6). In this manner, a ball that can be used for the target hitting game can also be given to the player by executing the acquisition game process. In addition, in the present embodiment, the proportion of the number of balls (three) given through the special support process described for the amount of virtual currency (30 coins) consumed in the special support process is set to be larger than the proportion of the number of balls (one) given through the acquisition game for the amount of virtual currency (100 coins) exchanged for a game item. In this manner, since balls can be more efficiently acquired through the special support than through the acquisition game by using an item, the special support will be positively used. As a result, communication between players can further be stimulated. Alternatively, the number of balls (three) given to the player in the special support process may be simply set to be larger than the number of balls (one) given in the acquisition game process independent of the amount of the virtual currency. <Summary> As described above, with the game system 1 according to the present embodiment, when a super rare card 51A (special card) is placed in the card placement area 51 by the placement unit 111, the supported player can try the target hitting game in an attempt to acquire the super rare card 51A. While the supported player is trying the target hitting game, the special support process for specially supporting the supported player by the supporting player is executed by consuming the virtual currency in addition to the support process for supporting the supported player by the supporting player. Although the number of executions of the support process is limited to a predetermined number or smaller, the execution of the special support process is permitted a number of times larger than the predetermined number. As a result, since the execution of the special support process is permitted even when the number of executions of the support process is limited, the supporting player's incentive to support another player can be increased and communication between players can be stimulated. Other Embodiments The above-described embodiment has been given for easy understanding of the present invention, and is not to construe the present invention in a limited manner. The present invention can be modified and improved without departing from the gist of the invention and includes its equivalents. In particular, embodiments described below are also included in the present invention. <Target Hitting Game> The target hitting game is described as one example of the lottery game in the embodiment described above. In the target hitting game, the probability with which a special card (super rare card 51A) is selected may be increased depending on the numbers of executions of the support process and the special support process. For example, while the supported player is trying the target hitting game in an attempt to acquire the super rare card 51A, any of the cards other than the super rare card 51A may be selected as a block card 51C from the cards placed in the card placement area 51, the number of block cards 51C corresponding to the number of times of support and special support of the supporting player, as illustrated in FIG. 18. In other words, the probability with which the super rare card 51A is selected is increased by excluding the block card 51C from the lottery of the target hitting game. Specifically, the count processing unit 117 counts the number of times of support and special support of another player (supporting player) on the basis of the player information illustrated in FIG. 6. The lottery processing unit 113B selects block cards 51C from the card placement area 51 according to the number of times of support counted by the count processing unit 117. For example, the lottery processing unit 113B selects one block card 51C if the counted number of times of support is five to nine, two block cards 51C if the counted number is 10 to 14, and three block cards 51C if the counted number is 15 or larger. Upon receiving a card request from the supported player, the lottery processing unit 113B then excludes the block cards 51C from selection and selects a card to be given to the supported player from the card placement area 51. This can encourage use of support and special support, and further stimulate communication between players. <Server Device> In the above-described embodiment, the game system 1 provided with one server device 10 as an example of a server device has been exemplarily described.
