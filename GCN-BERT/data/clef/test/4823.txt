Background Art [0002] Chloroprene rubbers, which are superior in mechanical properties, weather resistance, flame resistance, and others, have been used widely as materials for industrial rubber products. Under increasingly severe demand in performance to these industrial rubber products, there exists a need for a chloroprene rubber that is improved in abrasion resistance and ozone resistance yet retaining these properties. [0003] Known as the means of improving the abrasion resistance of chloroprene rubbers are a means of polymerizing chloroprene monomers using an alkylxanthogen sulfide as chain-transfer agent (see Patent Document l) and a means of forming a chloroprene rubber by polymerization and plasticizing the rubber in the presence of a tetraalkylthiuram disulfide having 3 to 7 carbon atoms during plasticization (see Patent Document 2). [0004] Also known as the technology for improving the ozone resistance of chloroprene rubbers is a means of adding a thiazole compound, thiuram compound, or thiourea compound to a rubber composition containing a chloroprene rubber and an ethylene-propylene-diene copolymer rubber (see Patent Document 3).

Advantageous Effects of Invention [0011] The present invention provides a vulcanizate superior in abrasion resistance and ozone resistance after vulcanization. Description of Embodiments [0012] Hereinafter, favorable embodiments of the invention will be described in detail. However, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to the embodiments below. [0013] (First embodiment) <Blended rubber> First of all, a blended rubber in the first embodiment of the present invention will be described. The blended rubber of the present embodiment contains (l) 30 to 93 mass % of a chloroprene rubber, (2) 5 to 50 mass % of a soft polyvinyl chloride, and (3) 2 to 20 mass % of an acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber as major components. Hereinafter, each component will be described in detail. [0014] (l) Chloroprene rubber The chloroprene rubber contained in the blended rubber of the present embodiment has a chloroprene polymer as major component. The chloroprene polymer is a homopolymer of 2-chloro- 1,3-butadiene (hereinafter, referred to as chloroprene) or a copolymer of chloroprene and other monomers. Examples of the monomers copolymerizable with chloroprene include acrylic acid esters such as methyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate; methacrylic acid esters such as methyl methacrylate, butyl methacrylate, and 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate; hydroxy (meth)acrylates such as 2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, 2-hydroxymethyl (meth)acrylate, and 2-hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate; 2,3-dichloro-1,3-butadiene, 1-chloro-l, 3-butadiene, butadiene, isoprene, ethylene, styrene, acrylonitrile, and the like. [0015] The monomer copolymerizable with chloroprene is not limited to a single monomer and may be, for example, a copolymer of three or more monomers including chloroprene. The polymer structure of the chloroprene polymer is also not particularly limited. [0016] The chloroprene rubbers contained in the blended rubbers of the present embodiment are classified into mercaptan-, xanthogen-, and sulfur-modified chloroprene rubbers. Any one of these chloroprene rubbers may be used in the present embodiment. [0017] The sulfur-modified chloroprene rubbers are, as will be described below, those prepared as the molecular weight of the chloroprene rubber is adjusted using a thiuram compound such as tetraethylthiuram disulfide, tetrabutylthiuram disulfide, or tetrakis(2-ethylhexyl)thiuram disulfide during polymerization of chloroprene monomers. The sulfur-modified chloroprene rubbers are characteristically superior in mechanical strength and also dimensional stability of the blended rubber composition, as compared to other modified chloroprene rubbers. It is thus possible by using a sulfur-modified chloroprene rubber to obtain a blended rubber composition improved in mechanical strength and dimensional stability. [0018] The mercaptan-modified chloroprene rubbers are, as will be described below, those obtained as the molecular weight of the chloroprene rubber is adjusted using an alkylmercaptan such as n-dodecylmercaptan, t-dodecyloctylmercaptan, or octylmercaptan during polymerization of chloroprene monomers. The mercaptan-modified chloroprene rubbers are characteristically superior in adhesiveness to metals, as compared with other modified chloroprene rubbers. It is thus possible by using a mercaptan-modified chloroprene rubber to prepare a blended rubber composition and a vulcanizate improved in adhesiveness to metals. [0019] The xanthogen-modified chloroprene rubbers are, as will be described below, those obtained as the molecular weight of the chloroprene rubber is adjusted using an alkylxanthogen compound during polymerization of chloroprene monomers. The xanthogen-modified chloroprene rubbers are characteristically superior in mechanical properties such as tensile strength and elongation at break, as compared with other modified chloroprene rubbers. It is thus possible by using a xanthogen-modified chloroprene rubber to prepare a composite composition and a vulcanizate improved in these mechanical properties. [0020] It is possible by using the sulfur-, mercaptan-, and xanthogen-modified chloroprene rubbers in combination to adjust favorably the properties of the blended rubber composition and vulcanizate (molded vulcanized foam) according to their applications. [0021] [Preparation of chloroprene rubber] The chloroprene rubber contained in the blended rubber of the present embodiment is prepared by emulsion-polymerizing raw monomers containing chloroprene as major component, using rosin as the emulsifying dispersant, for example. [0022] Examples of the catalysts for the polymerization reaction include inorganic peroxides such as potassium persulfate, organic peroxides such as ketone peroxides, peroxyketals, hydroperoxides, dialkyl peroxides, and diacyl peroxides. Examples of the catalyst-activating agents used include sodium sulfite, potassium sulfite, iron (II) oxide, anthraquinone, sodium 6-sulfonate, formamidinesulfonic acid, L-ascorbic acid, and the like. [0023] The polymerization initiator used may be, but is not particularly limited to, a polymerization initiator commonly used in emulsion polymerization of chloroprene. Specifically, persulfate salts such as potassium persulfate and organic peroxides such as t'butyl hydroperoxide are used favorably. [0024] The chain-transfer agent used may be, but is not particularly limited to, a chain-transfer agent commonly used in emulsion polymerization of chloroprene. Specifically, known chain-transfer agents including long-chain alkylmercaptans such as n-dodecylmercaptan, tert-dodecylmercaptan, and n-octylmercaptan, dialkylxanthogen disulfides such as diisopropylxanthogen disulfide and diethylxanthogen disulfide, and iodoform are used favorably. [0025] The polymerization terminator that is added for termination of polymerization may be, but is not particularly limited to, a polymerization terminator commonly used. Examples thereof favorably used include phenothiazine, para-t-butylcatechol, hydroquinone, hydroquinone monomethyl ether, diethylhydroxylamine, thiodiphenylamine, 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzene, and the like. [0026] The polymerization temperature for the chloroprene latex may be, but is not particularly limited, in the range at which emulsion polymerization is generally carried out. The final polymerization rate of the chloroprene polymer (chloroprene rubber) obtained in the polymerization step described above is preferably adjusted, but not limited, in the range of 30 to 100%. [0027] Unreacted monomers are then removed from the polymer solution obtained in the polymerization step (monomer removal). The method may be, but is not particularly limited to, a known method such as heating under reduced pressure. However, the final polymerization rate of the chloroprene polymer is preferably 30% or more, when productivity is taken into consideration. [0028] (2) Soft polyvinyl chloride The soft polyvinyl chloride contained in the blended rubber of the present embodiment, which is added for improvement of the abrasion resistance and ozone resistance of the vulcanizate obtained, comprises polyvinyl chloride and a plasticizer. The soft polyvinyl chloride preferably comprises a polyvinyl chloride having a polymerization degree in the range of 300 to 3000, as it is effective in improving the abrasion resistance and ozone resistance of the vulcanizate obtained. More preferably, the polymerization degree is 500 or more. More preferably, the polymerization degree is 2500 or less. [0029] The soft polyvinyl chloride is prepared by adding a plasticizer, together with a lubricant and an antioxidant agent, to a polyvinyl chloride. The polyvinyl chloride used may be any one of polyvinyl chlorides having a wide range of polymerization degree and is, for example, a commercially available polyvinyl chloride. The plasticizers used in preparation of the soft polyvinyl chloride include phthalic ester-, adipic acid-, chlorinated paraffin-, sebacic acid-, polyester-, phosphate ester-, polyether ester-, and trimellitic acid-based plasticizers and the like and these plasticizers may be used alone or in combination of two or more. [0030] Typical examples of the phthalic ester-based plasticizers include diisononyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, diundecyl phthalate, and the like. Typical examples of the adipic acid-based plasticizers include dioctyl adipate, dibutyl adipate, diisononyl adipate, diisodecyl adipate, and the like. [0031] The chlorinated paraffin-based plasticizer is typically a CIO to C30 chlorinated paraffin having a chlorination rate of 40 to 70%. The chlorination rate can be determined by the oxygen flask method according to JIS-K7229. Typical examples of the sebacic acid-based plasticizers include dioctyl sebacate, dimethyl sebacate, diethyl sebacate, dibutyl sebacate, diisopropyl sebacate, dicapryl sebacate, and the like. [0032] The polyester-based plasticizer is typically an adipic acid-based polyester, a phthalic acid-based polyester, or the like. Typical examples of the phosphate ester-based plasticizers include tricresyl phosphate, tributyl phosphate, trixylenyl phosphate, tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate, triphenyl phosphate, cresyl diphenyl phosphate, and the like. [0033] Examples of the polyether ester-based plasticizers include adipate ether ester-, epoxy ester-, and phthalate ether ester-based plasticizers and the like. Typical examples of the trimellitic acid-based plasticizers include trimethyl trimellitate, tris-2-ethylhexyl trimellitate, isononyl trimellitate, isooctyl trimellitate, and the like. [0034] The amount of the plasticizer added to the soft polyvinyl chloride contained in the blended rubber of the present embodiment is preferably 30 to 150 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the polyvinyl chloride. The amount of the plasticizer is more preferably 50 parts by mass or more. The amount of the plasticizer is more preferably 120 parts by mass or less. The plasticizer, when the content thereof is in the range above, can plasticize the polyvinyl chloride sufficiently and does not cause bleeding out of the resulting vulcanizate on the surface. Known examples of such a soft polyvinyl chloride include soft polyvinyl chloride resins manufactured by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, and the like. [0035] (3) Acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber An acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, which is a copolymer of acrylonitrile and 1,3-butadiene, is added for improvement of the ozone resistance and the mechanical strength of the vulcanizate obtained. The acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber used may be a known polymer having an arbitrary polymerization degree and may be, for example, a commercially available acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber. [0036] Acrylonitrile-butadiene rubbers are classified into low-nitrile rubbers having an acrylonitrile content of less than 25 mass %, medium-nitrile rubbers having an acrylonitrile content of 25 mass % or more and 35 mass % or less, and high-nitrile rubbers having an acrylonitrile content of more than 35 mass %. [0037] Among the acrylonitrile-butadiene rubbers above, those having an acrylonitrile content in the range of 18 mass % to 50 mass % with respect to the entire acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber are used favorably in the blended rubber of the present embodiment. The acrylonitrile content is more preferably 45 mass % or less. An acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber having an acrylonitrile content in the range above, when used, is effective in improving the ozone resistance and the mechanical strength of the vulcanizate obtained. [0038] The blended rubber is prepared by kneading (l) the chloroprene rubber, (2) the soft polyvinyl chloride, and (3) the acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber described above as major components. The blending rates of the chloroprene rubber, the soft polyvinyl chloride, and the acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber are respectively in the ranges of 30 to 93 mass %, 5 to 50 mass %, and 2 to 20 mass %. The rate of the chloroprene rubber is preferably 50 mass % or more. The rate of the chloroprene rubber is more preferably 90 mass % or less. The rate of the soft polyvinyl chloride resin is preferably 5 mass % or more. The rate of the soft polyvinyl chloride is more preferably 30 mass % or less. The rate of the acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber is preferably 5 mass % or more. The rate of the acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber is more preferably 20 mass % or less. [0039] When the content of the chloroprene rubber is larger than the range above, the vulcanizate obtained shows deterioration in ozone resistance. Alternatively when the content of the soft polyvinyl chloride is larger than the range above, the vulcanizate obtained shows deterioration in tensile strength. When the content of the acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber is larger than the range above, the vulcanizate obtained shows deterioration in heat resistance. The blending rate is substantially identical with the content rate of the chloroprene rubber, the soft polyvinyl chloride, and the acrylonitrile butadiene in the blended rubber of the present embodiment. [0040] In blending a chloroprene rubber, a soft polyvinyl chloride, and an acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, the chloroprene rubber, the soft polyvinyl chloride, and the acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber are kneaded in a known tightly-sealed mixer. [0041] As described above in detail, the blended rubber of the present embodiment, which contains particular amounts of a chloroprene rubber, a soft polyvinyl chloride, and an acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, gives a vulcanizate superior in abrasion resistance and ozone resistance. In particular, it is possible to improve the abrasion resistance and ozone resistance of the obtained vulcanizate by controlling the polymerization degree of the polyvinyl chloride contained in the soft polyvinyl chloride in the range of 300 to 3000. It is also possible to improve the mechanical strength of the obtained vulcanizate by making the acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber contain acrylonitrile at a rate of 18 to 50 mass %.

Specifically, trimethylolpropane, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, triallyl isocyanate, phenylene dimaleimide, or the like is used. [0054] Among the vulcanization accelerators described above, a vulcanization accelerator containing a thiuram compound and a thiazole compound is favorably used, as it is more effective in accelerating vulcanization of the blended rubber composition of the present embodiment.

(2) Ozone resistance The ozone resistance test was performed according to JIS Κ6259 using a UVC ozone aging tester manufactured by Toyo Seiki Seisaku-sho, Ltd., by holding the test piece, as it is extended by 20%, under an environment of a temperature of 40°C and an ozone concentration of 50 pphm and determining the period until cracking was observed (up to 20 days). A test piece resistant to cracking for at least 10 days was considered satisfactory. [0081] (Examples 2 to 25 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3) Blended rubber compositions and vulcanizates were prepared similarly to Example 1, except that the kinds and the blending amounts of the chloroprene rubber, the soft polyvinyl chloride, the acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber, the vulcanization accelerator, and the crosslinking aid used in Example 1 were changed to those shown in Table 1 or 2 and the vulcanizatesweresimilarly to Example 1.

In particular, the vulcanizates of Examples 15, 17, and 18, which were prepared using a sulfur-modified chloroprene rubber as chloroprene rubber, were further superior in abrasion resistance. The vulcanizate of Example 24, which was prepared using a peroxide (valerate peroxide) as vulcanization accelerator, was further superior in abrasion resistance. The vulcanizate of Example 25, which was prepared using a thiuram compound (tetramethylthiuram disulfide) and a thiazole compound (N-cyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolylsulphenamide) as vulcanization accelerators, was further superior in abrasion resistance. [0085] In contrast, the vulcanizate of Comparative Example 1, which did not contain any soft polyvinyl chloride as the blended rubber, was inferior in ozone resistance. Alternatively, the vulcanizate of Comparative Example 2, which had a soft polyvinyl chloride content of more than 50 mass % and an acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber content of more than 20 mass % in the blended rubber, was inferior in abrasion resistance. Yet alternatively, the vulcanizate of Comparative Example 3, which did not contain any acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber in the blended rubber, was inferior in abrasion resistance. [0086] The results above demonstrate that the present invention provides a blended rubber and a blended rubber composition that give a vulcanizate superior in abrasion resistance and ozone resistance after vulcanization, and a vulcanizate prepared by vulcanizing the composition. [0087] The vulcanizate according to the present invention can be used as industrial rubber products including automobile sealing materials, hose materials, molded rubber articles, gaskets, industrial cables, industrial conveyor belts, and the like. 1.
