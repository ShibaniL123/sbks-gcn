Step 4: preparation of intermediate tert-butyl 2-methoxy-7-oxo-6,7-dihydro-4H-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (3d)
To a solution of tert-butyl 2-chloro-7-oxo-4,6-dihydrothiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (3c) (3.75 g, 12.98 mmol) in anhydrous MeOH (97 mL) under inert atmosphere at -78°C was added dropwise a MeONa solution 0.5M in MeOH (28.6 mL, 14.30 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred for 15 min at -78°C, then for 30 min at rt. MeOH was removed under vacuum and the resulting residue was diluted with DCM and filtered on a mixture of silica gel and celite®. The product was eluted with DCM/EtOAc 8/2, concentrated in vacuo and purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (cyclohexane/EtOAc 90/10 to 80/20) to provide tert-butyl 2-methoxy-7-oxo-6,7-dihydro-4H-thiazolo[4,5-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate (3d) (2.23 g, 7.84 mmol, 60%) as a yellow solid.
