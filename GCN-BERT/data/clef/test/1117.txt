CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of priority of Provisional Application Nos. 61/563,516 entitled “ENHANCED TREATMENT REGIMENS USING MTOR INHIBITORS” and filed Nov. 23, 2011; which is fully incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The activity of cells can be regulated by external signals that stimulate or inhibit intracellular events. The process by which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response is referred to as signal transduction. Over the past decades, cascades of signal transduction events have been elucidated and found to play a central role in a variety of biological responses. Defects in various components of signal transduction pathways have been found to account for a vast number of diseases, including numerous forms of cancer, inflammatory disorders, metabolic disorders, vascular and neuronal diseases (Gaestel et al. Current Medicinal Chemistry (2007) 14:2214-2234). Kinases represent a class of important signaling molecules. Kinases can generally be classified into protein kinases and lipid kinases, and certain kinases exhibit dual specificities. Protein kinases are enzymes that phosphorylate other proteins and/or themselves (i.e., autophosphorylation). Protein kinases can be generally classified into three major groups based upon their substrate utilization: tyrosine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine residues (e.g., erb2, PDGF receptor, EGF receptor, VEGF receptor, src, abl), serine/threonine kinases which predominantly phosphorylate substrates on serine and/or threonine residues (e.g., mTorC1, mTorC2, ATM, AT, DNA-PK, Akt), and dual-specificity kinases which phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine, serine and/or threonine residues. Lipid kinases are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids. These enzymes, and the resulting phosphorylated lipids and lipid-derived biologically active organic molecules, play a role in many different physiological processes, including cell proliferation, migration, adhesion, and differentiation. Certain lipid kinases are membrane associated and they catalyze the phosphorylation of lipids contained in or associated with cell membranes. Examples of such enzymes include phosphoinositide(s) kinases (such as PI3-kinases, PI4-Kinases), diacylglycerol kinases, and sphingosine kinases. The phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) signaling pathway is one of the most highly mutated systems in human cancers. PI3K signaling is also a key factor in many other diseases in humans. PI3K signaling is involved in many disease states including allergic contact dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, disorders related to diabetic complications, and inflammatory complications of the cardiovascular system such as acute coronary syndrome. PI3Ks are members of a unique and conserved family of intracellular lipid kinases that phosphorylate the 3′-OH group on phosphatidylinositols or phosphoinositides. The PI3K family comprises 15 kinases with distinct substrate specificities, expression patterns, and modes of regulation (Katso et al., 2001). The class I PI3Ks (p110a, p110b, p110d, and p110 g) are typically activated by tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors to generate phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), which engages downstream effectors such as those in the Akt/PDK1 pathway, mTOR, the Tec family kinases, and the Rho family GTPases. The class II and III PI3-Ks play a key role in intracellular trafficking through the synthesis of PI(3)P and PI(3,4)P2. The PIKKs are protein kinases that control cell growth (mTORC1) or monitor genomic integrity (ATM, AT, DNA-PK, and hSmg-1). The production of PIP3 initiates potent growth and survival signals. In some epithelial cancers the PI3K pathway is activated by direct genetic mutation. As PI3K signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation and differentiation, inhibition of this pathway is believed to be beneficial in hyperproliferative diseases. Downstream mediators of the PI3K signal transduction pathway include Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Akt possesses a plckstrin homology (PH) domain that bind PIP3, leading to Akt kinase activation. Akt phosphorylates many substrates and is a central downstream effector of PI3K for diverse cellular responses. Full activation of Akt typically requires phosphorylation of T308 in the activation loop and S473 in a hydrophobic motif. One important function of Akt is to augment the activity of mTOR, through phosphorylation of TSC2 and other mechanisms. mTOR is a serine-threonine kinase related to the lipid kinases of the PI3K family. mTOR has been implicated in a wide range of biological processes including cell growth, cell proliferation, cell motility and survival. Disregulation of the mTOR pathway has been reported in various types of cancer. mTOR is a multifunctional kinase that integrates growth factor and nutrient signals to regulate protein translation, nutrient uptake, autophagy, and mitochondrial function. mTOR exists in two complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 contains the raptor subunit and mTORC2 contains rictor. These complexes are differentially regulated, and have distinct substrate specificities and rapamycin sensitivity. For example, mTORC1 phosphorylates S6 kinase (S6K) and 4EBP1, promoting increased translation and ribosome biogenesis to facilitate cell growth and cell cycle progression. S6K also acts in a feedback pathway to attenuate PI3K/Akt activation. mTORC2 is generally insensitive to rapamycin. mTORC2 is though to modulate growth factor signaling by phosphorylating the C-terminal hydrophobic motif of some AGC kinases such as Akt. In many cellular contexts, mTORC2 is required for phosphorylation of the S473 site of Akt. Over the past decade, mTOR has drawn considerable attention due to its role in cell growth control and its involvement in human diseases. mTor has been implicated in a wide range of disorders including but not limited to cancer, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders. It has been shown that mTOR modulates many fundamental biological processes including transcription, translation, autophagy, actin organization and ribosome biogenesis by integrating intracellular and extracellular signals, such as signals mediated by growth factors, nutrients, energy levels and cellular stress. As such, kinases particularly protein kinases such as mTor and Akt, as well as lipid kinases such as PI3Ks are prime targets for drug development. At the same time, tolerability and prevalence of side effects are important considerations in structuring courses of treatment for many diseases. For example, treatments which require the use of therapeutic agents which result in severe adverse events may become ineffective due to insufficient patient compliance or because an effective therapeutic dose cannot be administered to the patient. Similarly, treatments which result in a higher effective concentration of the drug being present in the blood stream for a longer period of time may provide better therapeutic efficacy. The present invention addresses this need in the art by providing methods and compositions for mTor inhibition and treatment regimens utilizing such methods and compositions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides a method of treating a disorder in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor to said subject according to an intermittent regimen effective to achieve an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor plasma concentration at or above about 100 nM for a duration of time that is longer than that achieved by administering an equivalent dose of the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor once daily. In some embodiments, the intermittent regimen is effective to achieve an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor plasma concentration of greater than about 100 nM for a duration longer than about 20 hours during a 7-day period of administration. In other embodiments, the intermittent regimen is effective to achieve an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor plasma concentration of greater than about 100 nM for a duration of at least about 30 hours during a 7-day period of administration. The invention further provides a method of treating a disorder in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor to said subject according to an intermittent regimen, such that the achieved Cmax is greater than that achieved by administering an equivalent dose of the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor once daily. For example, the intermittent regimen is effective to achieve a Cmax which is greater by about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 100%, 200%, or 300% than the Cmax achieved by administering an equivalent dose of the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor once daily. In some embodiments, the intermittent regimen is effective to achieve a Cmax of greater than about 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550 or 600 nM. For example, the intermittent regimen is effective to achieve a Cmax of greater than about 300 nM. The intermittent regimens of the invention may achieve similar or better pathway inhibition than administering an equivalent dose of the mTorC1/mTorC2 once daily. In some embodiments, the pathway inhibition is measured as percentage of decrease in phosphorylation of a protein chosen from p4EBP1, pS6, and pRAS40. The intermittent regimens of the invention may also achieve similar or better therapeutic efficacy than administering an equivalent dose of the mTorC1/mTorC2 once daily. Further, the intermittent regimens of the invention may achieve at least the same level of tolerability as compared to administering an equivalent dose of the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor once daily. In some embodiments, the level of tolerability is measured as the occurrence or lack of occurrence in the subject of a grade 3 or higher adverse event. For example, the adverse event is rash. In some embodiments, an intermittent regimen of the invention comprises at least one cycle in which the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is administered for at least 1 day, followed by an intermission in which the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is not administered for at least 1 day. For instance, the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is administered for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 consecutive days followed by an intermission in which the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is not administered for at least 1 day. Alternatively, the regimen comprises at least one cycle in which the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is administered for 1 day followed by an intermission in which the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is not administered for 6 consecutive days. Alternatively, the regimen comprises at least one cycle in which the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is administered for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 consecutive days followed by an intermission in which the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is not administered for at least 3, 4, or 5 consecutive days. In some embodiments, the regimen comprises at least one 7-day cycle in which the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is administered for 3 consecutive days followed by an intermission of 4 consecutive days. In other embodiments, the regimen comprises at least one 7-day cycle in which the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is administered for 5 consecutive days followed by an intermission of 2 consecutive days. In still other embodiments, the regimen comprises at least one 7-day cycle in which the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is administered at least 3 times on alternate days within the 7 days.

In some embodiments, the dosage form is capable of providing a plasma concentration of said mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor of greater than about 100 nM for a duration of time longer than about 20 hours during a 7-day period of administration. For example, the dosage form is capable of providing a plasma concentration of greater than 100 nM for a duration of time that is at least about 30 hours during a 7-day period of administration. In some embodiments, the dosage form comprises about 45, 50, 55, 60, 70, 75 mg or less of the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor. The invention also provides a method of treating a disorder in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering a dosage form of the invention. Further provided herein is a kit comprising a dosage form as described and additionally comprising instructions for administration to a subject in need thereof. For example, the instructions provide for at least one 7-day cycle of administration to the subject for 2, 3, 4, or 5 consecutive days followed by an intermission of 5, 4, 3, or 2 days, respectively. In some embodiments, the instructions provide for administration of the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor to the subject for 3 consecutive days followed by an intermission of 4 consecutive days. The invention further provides a pharmaceutical regimen for the treatment of a disorder, the regimen comprising an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor, wherein the regimen provides an area under the curve that is similar to that obtained by administering the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor once daily, and wherein the regimen results in higher therapeutic efficacy as compared to administering said inhibitor once daily. For any method of treatment provided by the invention, the disorders to be treated include, but are not limited to, a neoplastic condition, autoimmune disease, inflammatory disease, fibrotic disease or kidney disease. For example, the disorder is a neoplastic condition such as cancer.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Several aspects of the invention are described below with reference to example applications for illustration. It should be understood that numerous specific details, relationships, and methods are set forth to provide a full understanding of the invention. One having ordinary skill in the relevant art, however, will readily recognize that the invention can be practiced without one or more of the specific details or with other methods. Unless stated otherwise, the present invention is not limited by the illustrated ordering of acts or events, as some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts or events. Furthermore, not all illustrated acts or events are required to implement a methodology in accordance with the present invention. The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the invention. As used herein, the singular forms “a”, “an” and “the” are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. Furthermore, to the extent that the terms “including”, “includes”, “having”, “has”, “with”, or variants thereof are used in either the detailed description and/or the claims, such terms are intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term “comprising”. The term “about” or “approximately” means within an acceptable error range for the particular value as determined by one of ordinary skill in the art, which will depend in part on how the value is measured or determined, i.e., the limitations of the measurement system. For example, “about” can mean within 1 or more than 1 standard deviation, per the practice in the art. Alternatively, “about” can mean a range of up to 20%, up to 10%, up to 5%, or up to 1% of a given value. Alternatively, particularly with respect to biological systems or processes, the term can mean within an order of magnitude, preferably within 5-fold, and more preferably within 2-fold, of a value. Where particular values are described in the application and claims, unless otherwise stated the term “about” meaning within an acceptable error range for the particular value should be assumed. “Treatment”, “treating”, “palliating” and “ameliorating”, as used herein, are used interchangeably. These terms refer to an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including but not limited to therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit. By therapeutic benefit is meant eradication or amelioration of the underlying disorder being treated. Also, a therapeutic benefit is achieved with the eradication or amelioration of one or more of the physiological symptoms associated with the underlying disorder such that an improvement is observed in the patient, notwithstanding that the patient may still be afflicted with the underlying disorder. For prophylactic benefit, the compositions may be administered to a patient at risk of developing a particular disease, or to a patient reporting one or more of the physiological symptoms of a disease, even though a diagnosis of this disease may not have been made. As used herein, the term “neoplastic condition” refers to the presence of cells possessing abnormal growth characteristics, such as uncontrolled proliferation, immortality, metastatic potential, rapid growth and proliferation rate, perturbed oncogenic signaling, and certain characteristic morphological features. This includes but is not limited to the growth of: (1) benign or malignant cells (e.g., tumor cells) that correlates with overexpression of a tyrosine or serine/threonine kinase; (2) benign or malignant cells (e.g., tumor cells) that correlates with abnormally high level of tyrosine or serine/threonine kinase activity. Exemplary tyrosine kinases implicated in a neoplastic condition include but are not limited to receptor tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptors (EGF receptor), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors, and cyotsolic tyrosine kinases such as src and abl kinase. Non-limiting serine/threonine kinases implicated in neoplastic condition include but are not limited to raf and mek. The term “effective amount” or “therapeutically effective amount” refers to that amount of an inhibitor described herein that is sufficient to effect the intended application including but not limited to disease treatment, as defined below. The therapeutically effective amount may vary depending upon the intended application (in vitro or in vivo), or the subject and disease condition being treated, e.g., the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the disease condition, the manner of administration and the like, which can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art. The term also applies to a dose that will induce a particular response in target cells, e.g., reduction of proliferation or downregulation of activity of a target protein. The specific dose will vary depending on the particular compounds chosen, the dosing regimen to be followed, whether it is administered in combination with other compounds, timing of administration, the tissue to which it is administered, and the physical delivery system in which it is carried. A “sub-therapeutic amount” of an agent or therapy is an amount less than the effective amount for that agent or therapy, but when combined with an effective or sub-therapeutic amount of another agent or therapy can produce a result desired by the physician, due to, for example, synergy in the resulting efficacious effects, or reduced side effects. A “synergistically effective” therapeutic amount or “synergistically effective” amount of an agent or therapy is an amount which, when combined with an effective or sub-therapeutic amount of another agent or therapy, produces a greater effect than when either of the two agents are used alone. In some embodiments, a syngergistically effective therapeutic amount of an agent or therapy produces a greater effect when used in combination than the additive effects of each of the two agents or therapies when used alone. The term “greater effect” encompasses not only a reduction in symptoms of the disorder to be treated, but also an improved side effect profile, improved tolerability, improved patient compliance, improved efficacy, or any other improved clinical outcome. As used herein, “agent” or “biologically active agent” refers to a biological, pharmaceutical, or chemical compound or other moiety. Non-limiting examples include simple or complex organic or inorganic molecule, a peptide, a protein, an oligonucleotide, an antibody, an antibody derivative, antibody fragment, a vitamin derivative, a carbohydrate, a toxin, or a chemotherapeutic compound. Various compounds can be synthesized, for example, small molecules and oligomers (e.g., oligopeptides and oligonucleotides), and synthetic organic compounds based on various core structures. In addition, various natural sources can provide compounds for screening, such as plant or animal extracts, and the like. A skilled artisan can readily recognize that there is no limit as to the structural nature of the agents of the present invention. The term “agonist” as used herein refers to a compound having the ability to initiate or enhance a biological function of a target protein, whether by inhibiting the activity or expression of the target protein. Accordingly, the term “agonist” is defined in the context of the biological role of the target polypeptide. While preferred agonists herein specifically interact with (e.g., bind to) the target, compounds that initiate or enhance a biological activity of the target polypeptide by interacting with other members of the signal transduction pathway of which the target polypeptide is a member are also specifically included within this definition. The terms “antagonist” and “inhibitor” are used interchangeably, and they refer to a compound having the ability to inhibit a biological function of a target protein, whether by inhibiting the activity or expression of the target protein. Accordingly, the terms “antagonist” and “inhibitors” are defined in the context of the biological role of the target protein. While preferred antagonists herein specifically interact with (e.g., bind to) the target, compounds that inhibit a biological activity of the target protein by interacting with other members of the signal transduction pathway of which the target protein is a member are also specifically included within this definition. A preferred biological activity inhibited by an antagonist is associated with the development, growth, or spread of a tumor, or an undesired immune response as manifested in autoimmune disease. The phrases “mTorC1/C2 inhibitor”, “mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor”, or “mTOR inhibitor that binds to and directly inhibits both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinases” are used interchangeably and refer to an mTOR inhibitor that interacts with and reduces the kinase activity of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes. An “anti-neoplastic”, “anti-cancer agent”, “anti-tumor agent” or “chemotherapeutic agent” refers to any agent useful in the treatment of a neoplastic condition. One class of anti-cancer agents comprises chemotherapeutic agents. “Chemotherapy” means the administration of one or more chemotherapeutic drugs and/or other agents to a cancer patient by various methods, including intravenous, oral, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravesical, subcutaneous, transdermal, buccal, or inhalation or in the form of a suppository. As used herein, the term “antiangiogenic” refers to the ability to inhibit or impair the formation of blood vessels, including but not limited to inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation, endothelial cell migration, and capillary tube formation. The term “cell proliferation” refers to a phenomenon by which the cell number has changed as a result of division. This term also encompasses cell growth by which the cell morphology has changed (e.g., increased in size) consistent with a proliferative signal. The terms “co-administration,” “administered in combination with,” and their grammatical equivalents, encompass administration of two or more agents to an animal so that both agents and/or their metabolites are present in the animal at the same time. Co-administration includes simultaneous administration in separate compositions, administration at different times in separate compositions, or administration in a composition in which both agents are present. Co-administered agents may be in the same formulation. Co-administered agents may also be in different formulations. A “therapeutic effect,” as used herein, encompasses a therapeutic benefit and/or a prophylactic benefit as described above. A prophylactic effect includes delaying or eliminating the appearance of a disease or condition, delaying or eliminating the onset of symptoms of a disease or condition, slowing, halting, or reversing the progression of a disease or condition, or any combination thereof. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to salts derived from a variety of organic and inorganic counter ions well known in the art. Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts can be formed with inorganic acids and organic acids. Inorganic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like. Organic acids from which salts can be derived include, for example, acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salts can be formed with inorganic and organic bases. Inorganic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum, and the like. Organic bases from which salts can be derived include, for example, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines, basic ion exchange resins, and the like, specifically such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, and ethanolamine. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable base addition salt is chosen from ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts. “Pharmaceutically acceptable carrier” or “pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutically active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions of the invention is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions. “Signal transduction” is a process during which stimulatory or inhibitory signals are transmitted into and within a cell to elicit an intracellular response. A modulator of a signal transduction pathway refers to a compound that modulates the activity of one or more cellular proteins mapped to the same specific signal transduction pathway. A modulator may augment (agonist) or suppress (antagonist) the activity of a signaling molecule. The term “selective inhibition” or “selectively inhibit” as applied to a biologically active agent refers to the agent's ability to selectively reduce the target signaling activity as compared to off-target signaling activity, via direct or interact interaction with the target. “Subject” refers to an animal, such as a mammal, for example a human. The methods described herein can be useful in both human therapeutics, pre-clinical, and veterinary applications. In some embodiments, the subject is a mammal, and in some embodiments, the subject is human. The term “in vivo” refers to an event that takes place in a subject's body. The term “in vitro” refers to an event that takes places outside of a subject's body. For example, an in vitro assay encompasses any assay run outside of a subject assay. In vitro assays encompass cell-based assays in which cells alive or dead are employed. In vitro assays also encompass a cell-free assay in which no intact cells are employed. Unless otherwise stated, the connections of compound name moieties are at the rightmost recited moiety. That is, the substituent name starts with a terminal moiety, continues with any linking moieties, and ends with the linking moiety. For example, heteroarylthio C1-4 alkyl has a heteroaryl group connected through a thio sulfur to a C1-4 alkyl radical that connects to the chemical species bearing the substituent. This condition does not apply where a formula such as, for example “-L-C1-10 alkyl-C3-8cycloalkyl” is represented. In such case, the terminal group is a C3-8cycloalkyl group attached to a linking C1-10 alkyl moiety which is attached to an element L, which is itself connected to the chemical species bearing the substituent. “Alkyl” refers to a straight or branched hydrocarbon chain radical consisting solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms, containing no unsaturation, having from one to ten carbon atoms (e.g., C1-C10 alkyl). Whenever it appears herein, a numerical range such as “1 to 10” refers to each integer in the given range; e.g., “1 to 10 carbon atoms” means that the alkyl group may consist of 1 carbon atom, 2 carbon atoms, 3 carbon atoms, etc., up to and including 10 carbon atoms, although the present definition also covers the occurrence of the term “alkyl” where no numerical range is designated. In some embodiments, it is a C1-C4 alkyl group. Typical alkyl groups include, but are in no way limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, sec-butyl isobutyl, tertiary butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, septyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, and the like.

In some embodiments, it is a C1-C10 acyl radical which refers to the total number of chain or ring atoms of the alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl or heterocycloalkyl portion of the acyloxy group plus the carbonyl carbon of acyl, i.e three other ring or chain atoms plus carbonyl. If the R radical is heteroaryl or heterocycloalkyl, the hetero ring or chain atoms contribute to the total number of chain or ring atoms.

Either portion of the moiety is unsubstituted or substituted. The term “bicycloalkyl” refers to a structure consisting of two cycloalkyl moieties, unsubstituted or substituted, that have two or more atoms in common. If the cycloalkyl moieties have exactly two atoms in common they are said to be “fused”. Examples include, but are not limited to, bicyclo[3.1.0]hexyl, perhydronaphthyl, and the like. If the cycloalkyl moieties have more than two atoms in common they are said to be “bridged”. Examples include, but are not limited to, bicyclo[3.2.1]heptyl (“norbornyl”), bicyclo[2.2.2]octyl, and the like.

When R′ and R″ or R″ and R′″ are attached to the same nitrogen atom, they can be combined with the nitrogen atom to form a 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-membered ring. For example, —NR′R″ is meant to include, but not be limited to, 1-pyrrolidinyl, 4 piperazinyl, and 4-morpholinyl. From the above discussion of substituents, one of skill in the art will understand that the term “alkyl” is meant to include groups including carbon atoms bound to groups other than hydrogen groups, such as haloalkyl (e.g., —CF3 and CH2CF3) and acyl (e.g., —C(O)CH3, —C(O)CF3, —C(O)CH2OCH3, and the like).

When an inhibitor of the invention includes more than one R group, for example, each of the R groups is independently selected as are each R′, R″, R′″ and R″″ groups when more than one of these groups is present. As used herein, 0-2 in the context of —S(O)(0-2)— are integers of 0, 1, and 2. Two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally form a ring of the formula -T-C(O)—(CRR′)q—U—, wherein T and U are independently NR—, —O—, —CRR′— or a single bond, and q is an integer of from 0 to 3. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula -A-(CH2)r—B—, wherein A and B are independently —CRR′—, —O—, —NR—, —S—, —S(O)—, —S(O)2—, —S(O)2NR′— or a single bond, and r is an integer of from 1 to 4. One of the single bonds of the new ring so formed may optionally be replaced with a double bond. Alternatively, two of the substituents on adjacent atoms of aryl or heteroaryl ring may optionally be replaced with a substituent of the formula —(CRR′)s—X′—(C″R′″)d—, where s and d are independently integers of from 0 to 3, and X′ is —O—, —NR7—, —S—, —S(O)—, —S(O)2—, or —S(O)2NR′—. The substituents, R′, R″ and R′″ are preferably independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, substituted or unsubstituted cycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted heterocycloalkyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, and substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl. Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include compounds which differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except for the replacement of a hydrogen by a deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by 13C- or 14C-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention. The compounds of the present invention may also contain unnatural proportions of atomic isotopes at one or more of atoms that constitute such compounds. For example, the compounds may be radiolabeled with radioactive isotopes, such as for example tritium (3H), iodine-125 (125I) or carbon-14 (14C). All isotopic variations of the compounds of the present invention, whether radioactive or not, are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Treatment Regimens The invention provides an intermittent treatment regimen in which an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is administered to a subject and where the intermittent regimen is effective to achieve an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor plasma concentration at or above about 100 nM for a duration of time that is longer than that achieved by administering an equivalent dose of the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor once daily. As used herein, the term “equivalent dose” refers to a single or multiple dose administered to a subject over a period of time, including a day, several days, a week, a month or longer. In some embodiments, equivalence is evaluated during the length of a treatment cycle, e.g. a week. The term equivalent dose is not limited to identical amounts of a compound administered of a specified period of time, but also refers to dose amounts which result in a similar level of tolerability. By way of example, when comparing a regimen of the invention in which an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is administered intermittently at a weekly cumulative dose of 50 mg, with a regimen in which the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is administered daily, it may only possible to achieve a weekly cumulative dose of less than 50 mg (e.g. about 40-45 mg) using daily administration due to dose-limiting toxicity and/or limited tolerability. In such a case, administration of the weekly cumulative 50 mg dose in the intermittent regimen is “equivalent” to the about 40-45 mg weekly cumulative dose administered daily. For example, the intermittent regimen is effective to achieve an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor plasma concentration of greater than about 80, 90, 100, 100, 120, 130, 140, 150, or 160 nM for a duration longer than about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, or 35 hours during a 7-day period of administration. In some instances, the intermittent regimen is effective to achieve an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor plasma concentration of greater than about 100 nM for a duration longer than about 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, or 35 hours during a 7-day period of administration. In other instances, the intermittent regimen is effective to achieve an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor plasma concentration of greater than about 100 nM for a duration longer than about 20 or about 30 hours during a 7-day period of administration. The invention also provides a treatment regimen which is effective to achieve a Cmax which is greater by about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 150%, 200%, 250%, or 300% than the Cmax achieved by administering an equivalent dose of the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor once daily. For example, the Cmax achieved is greater than about 100, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550 or 600 nM. In some instances, the Cmax achieved is greater than about 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 550 or 600 nM. For example, the Cmax is greater than 200 nM. Alternatively, the Cmax is greater than 300 nM. In other instances, the Cmax achieved is between 200 and 600 nM. In yet other instances, the Cmax achieved is between 200 and 500 nM. In yet other instances, the Cmax achieved is between 200 and 500 nM. In some embodiments, an intermittent treatment regimen of the invention achieves similar or better pathway inhibition than administering an equivalent dose of the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor once daily. Pathway inhibition may be measured, for example, as a percentage decrease in phosphorylation of a protein chosen from p4EBP1, pS6, and pRAS40. In some embodiments, pathway inhibition is measured as a 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or greater decrease in phosphorylation of p4EBP1. For example, phosphorylation of p4EBP1 is reduced by at least 60%. In other embodiments, pathway inhibition is measured as a 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or greater decrease in phosphorylation of pS6. For example, phosphorylation of pS6 is reduced by at least 60%. In yet other embodiments, pathway inhibition is measured as a 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or greater decrease in phosphorylation of pRAS40. For example, phosphorylation of pRAS40 is reduced by at least 60%. In yet other embodiments, pathway inhibition is measured as a 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95% or greater decrease in phosphorylation of p4EBP1, pS6, and pRAS40. For example, phosphorylation of p4EBP1, pS6, and pRAS40 is reduced by at least 60%. In some embodiments, pathway inhibition is measured in peripheral blood cells. In other embodiments, pathway inhibition is measured in a biopsy, for example a skin biopsy. In some embodiments, an intermittent treatment regimen of the invention achieves similar or better level of tolerability as compared to administering an equivalent dose of the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor once daily. The level of tolerability may be measured, for example, as the occurrence or lack of occurrence of a grade 3 or higher adverse event. In some embodiments, the adverse event is rash, hyperglycaemia, lymphopenia, diarrhea, gamma-glutamyltransferase increase, hypokalaemia, hyponatraemia, pruritus, thrombocytopenia, upper abdominal pain, anaemia, aspartate aminotransferase increase, asthenia, catheter related infection, cellulitis, disease progression, enterocutaneous fistula, gastroenteritis, acute pancreatitis, pleural effusion, macular rash, somnolence, or urinary tract infection. For example, the adverse event is rash. In some embodiments, a given dosing schedule comprises one or more administrations of an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor, wherein at least one administration of an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor, such as described herein, may be repeated or cycled on a daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, bimonthly, annually, semi-annually, or any other period. A repeated dosing schedule or cycle may be repeated for a fixed period of time determined at the start of the schedule; may be terminated, extended, or otherwise adjusted based on a measure of therapeutic effect, such as a level of reduction in the presence of detectable disease tissue (e.g. a reduction of at least 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 99%, or 100%); or may be terminated, extended, or otherwise adjusted for any other reason as determined by a medical professional. In some embodiments, the intermittent regimen comprises at least one cycle in which the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is administered for at least 1 day, followed by an intermission in which the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is not administered for at least 1 day. For example, the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is administered for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 consecutive days followed by an intermission in which the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is not administered for at least 1 day, for example not administered for at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days. In some embodiments, the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is administered for 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, or 14 consecutive days, followed by an intermission where the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is not administered for at least 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days. In other embodiments, the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is administered for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7 consecutive days followed by an intermission in which the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is not administered for at least 3, 4, or 5 consecutive days. In yet other embodiments, the regimen comprises at least one 7-day cycle in which the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is administered for 3 consecutive days followed by an intermission of 4 consecutive days. In yet other embodiments, the regimen comprises at least one 7-day cycle in which the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is administered for 4 consecutive days followed by an intermission of 3 consecutive days.

Dosing may be about once, twice, three times, four times, five times, six times, or more than six times per day or per week. Dosing may be about once a month, once every two weeks, once a week, or once every other day. In some embodiments, cycles of administering an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor followed by periods of rest (intermission) are repeated for more than about 6, 10, 14, 28 days, two months, six months, or one year. In some cases, repetition of a dosing cycle comprising administration of an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor followed by rest are continued as long as necessary. Administration of the treatment regimens of the invention may continue as long as necessary. In some embodiments, an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor of the invention is administered for more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, or 28 days. In some embodiments, an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor of the invention is administered for less than 28, 14, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 day. In some embodiments, an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor of the invention is administered chronically on an ongoing basis, e.g., for the treatment of chronic effects. The amount of the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor administered herein may vary depending upon the intended application (in vitro or in vivo), or the subject and disease condition being treated, e.g., the weight and age of the subject, the severity of the disease condition, the manner of administration and the like, which can readily be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art.

The amount of each inhibitor administered will be dependent on the mammal being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. mTORC1/mTORC2 Inhibitor Compounds An mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor for use in the present invention can be any mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor that is known in the art, and can include any chemical entity that, upon administration to a patient, results in inhibition of mTOR in the patient. An mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor can inhibit mTorC1/mTorC2 by any biochemical mechanism, including competition at the ATP binding site, competition elsewhere at the catalytic site of mTOR kinase, non-competitive inhibition, irreversible inhibition (e.g. covalent protein modification), or modulation of the interactions of other protein subunits or binding proteins with mTOR kinase in a way that results in inhibition of mTOR kinase activity (e.g. modulation of the interaction of mTOR with FKBP12, GβL, (mLST8), RAPTOR (mKOG1), or RICTOR (mAVO3)). Such inhibitors useful in the invention described herein include those disclosed and claimed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,700,594 and in U.S. Pat. No. 7,651,687, a series of compounds that inhibit mTOR by binding to and directly inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinases. Similar results can be obtained with any compound that inhibits mTOR by binding to and directly inhibiting both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinases, such as those whose structures are disclosed herein. Additional such compounds can readily be identified by determining their ability to inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2 kinase activities using immunoprecipitation-kinase assays with antibodies specific to either the raptor or rictor proteins of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes (for an example of such assays, see Jacinto, E. et al. (2004) Nature Cell Biol. 6(11): 1122-1128). Also useful in the invention described herein are mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitors that are dual PI3K/mTOR kinase inhibitors, such as for example the compound PI-103 as described in Fan, Q-W et al (2006) Cancer Cell 9:341-349 and Knight, Z. A. et al. (2006) Cell 125:733-747. In some embodiments, the capacity of an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor to inhibit mTorC1/mTorC2 is expressed in terms of an IC50 value. As used herein, the term “IC50” refers to the half maximal inhibitory concentration of an inhibitor in inhibiting biological or biochemical function. This quantitative measure indicates how much of a particular inhibitor is needed to inhibit a given biological process (or component of a process, i.e. an enzyme, cell, cell receptor or microorganism) by half. In other words, it is the half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC) of a substance (50% IC, or IC50). EC50 refers to the plasma concentration required for obtaining 50% of a maximum effect in vivo. Determination of IC50 can be made by determining and constructing a dose-response curve and examining the effect of different concentrations of an inhibitor on reversing agonist activity. In vitro assays that are useful in making these determinations are referred to as “in vitro kinase assays.” In some embodiments, an in vitro kinase assay includes the use of labeled ATP as phosphodonor, and following the kinase reaction the substrate peptide is captured on an appropriate filter. Unreacted labeled ATP and metabolites are resolved from the radioactive peptide substrate by various techniques, such as involving trichloroacetic acid precipitation and extensive washing. Addition of several positively charged residues allows capture on phosphocellulose paper followed by washing. Radioactivity incorporated into the substrate peptide is detected by scintillation counting. This assay is relatively simple, reasonably sensitive, and the peptide substrate can be adjusted both in terms of sequence and concentration to meet the assay requirements. Other exemplary kinase assays are detailed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,759,787 and U.S. application Ser. No. 12/728,926, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. The ability of an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor utilized in the subject methods to bind to and directly inhibit both mTORC1 and mTORC2 can be ascertained using any method known in the art or described herein. For example, inhibition of mTorC1 and/or mTorC2 activity can be determined by a reduction in signal transduction of the PI3K/Akt/mTor pathway. A wide variety of readouts can be utilized to establish a reduction of the output of such signaling pathway. Some non-limiting exemplary readouts include (1) a decrease in phosphorylation of Akt at residues, including but not limited to S473 and T308; (2) a decrease in activation of Akt as evidenced by a reduction of phosphorylation of Akt substrates including but not limited to FoxO1/O3a T24/32, GSK3α/β S21/9, and TSC2 T1462; (3) a decrease in phosphorylation of signaling molecules downstream of mTor, including but not limited to ribosomal S6S240/244, 70S6K T389, and 4EBP1T37/46; (4) inhibition of proliferation of cells including but not limited to normal or neoplastic cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts, leukemic blast cells, cancer stem cells, and cells that mediate autoimmune reactions; (5) induction of apoptosis of cells or cell cycle arrest (e.g. accumulation of cells in G1 phase); (6) reduction of cell chemotaxis; and (7) an increase in binding of 4EBP1 to eIF4E. mTOR exists in two types of complexes, mTorC1 containing the raptor subunit and mTorC2 containing rictor. As known in the art, “rictor” refers to a cell growth regulatory protein having human gene locus 5p13.1. These complexes are regulated differently and have a different spectrum of substrates. For instance, mTorC1 phosphorylates S6 kinase (S6K) and 4EBP1, promoting increased translation and ribosome biogenesis to facilitate cell growth and cell cycle progression. S6K also acts in a feedback pathway to attenuate PI3K/Akt activation. Thus, inhibition of mTorC1 (e.g. by a biologically active agent as discussed herein) results in activation of 4EBP1, resulting in inhibition of (e.g. a decrease in) RNA translation. mTorC2 is generally insensitive to rapamycin and selective inhibitors and is thought to modulate growth factor signaling by phosphorylating the C-terminal hydrophobic motif of some AGC kinases such as Akt. In many cellular contexts, mTorC2 is required for phosphorylation of the S473 site of Akt. Thus, mTorC1 activity is partly controlled by Akt whereas Akt itself is partly controlled by mTorC2. Growth factor stimulation of PI3K causes activation of Akt by phosphorylation at the two key sites, S473 and T308. It has been reported that full activation of Akt requires phosphorylation of both S473 and T308Active. Akt promotes cell survival and proliferation in many ways including suppressing apoptosis, promoting glucose uptake, and modifying cellular metabolism. Of the two phosphorylation sites on Akt, activation loop phosphorylation at T308, mediated by PDK1, is believed to be indispensable for kinase activity, while hydrophobic motif phosphorylation at S473 enhances Akt kinase activity. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation can be determined using any methods known in the art or described herein. Representative assays include but are not limited to immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation with antibodies such as anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies that recognize the specific phosphorylated proteins. Cell-based ELISA kit quantifies the amount of activated (phosphorylated at S473) Akt relative to total Akt protein is also available (SuperArray Biosciences). Selective mTor inhibition may also be determined by expression levels of the mTor genes, its downstream signaling genes (for example by RT-PCR), or expression levels of the proteins (for example by immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry, Western blots) as compared to other PI3-kinases or protein kinases. Cell-based assays for establishing selective inhibition of mTorC1 and/or mTorC2 can take a variety of formats. This generally will depend on the biological activity and/or the signal transduction readout that is under investigation. For example, the ability of the agent to inhibit mTorC1 and/or mTorC2 to phosphorylate downstream substrate(s) can be determined by various types of kinase assays known in the art. Representative assays include but are not limited to immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation with antibodies such as anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-phosphoserine or anti-phosphothreonine antibodies that recognize phosphorylated proteins. Alternatively, antibodies that specifically recognize a particular phosphorylated form of a kinase substrate (e.g. anti-phospho AKT S473 or anti-phospho AKT T308) can be used. In addition, kinase activity can be detected by high throughput chemiluminescent assays such as AlphaScreen™ (available from Perkin Elmer) and eTag™ assay (Chan-Hui, et al. (2003) Clinical Immunology 111: 162-174). In another aspect, single cell assays such as flow cytometry as described in the phosflow experiment can be used to measure phosphorylation of multiple downstream mTOR substrates in mixed cell populations. One advantage of the immunoblotting and phosflow methods is that the phosphorylation of multiple kinase substrates can be measured simultaneously. This provides the advantage that efficacy and selectivity can be measured at the same time. For example, cells may be contacted with an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor at various concentrations and the phosphorylation levels of substrates of both mTOR and other kinases can be measured. In one aspect, a large number of kinase substrates are assayed in what is termed a “comprehensive kinase survey.” Selective mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitors are expected to inhibit phosphorylation of mTOR substrates without inhibiting phosphorylation of the substrates of other kinases. Alternatively, selective mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitors may inhibit phosphorylation of substrates of other kinases through anticipated or unanticipated mechanisms such as feedback loops or redundancy. Effect of inhibition of mTorC1 and/or mTorC2 can be established by cell colony formation assay or other forms of cell proliferation assay. A wide range of cell proliferation assays are available in the art, and many of which are available as kits. Non-limiting examples of cell proliferation assays include testing for tritiated thymidine uptake assays, BrdU (5′-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine) uptake (kit marketed by Calibochem), MTS uptake (kit marketed by Promega), MTT uptake (kit marketed by Cayman Chemical), CyQUANT® dye uptake (marketed by Invitrogen). Apoptosis and cell cycle arrest analysis can be performed with any methods exemplified herein as well other methods known in the art. Many different methods have been devised to detect apoptosis. Exemplary assays include but are not limited to the TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling) analysis, ISEL (in situ end labeling), and DNA laddering analysis for the detection of fragmentation of DNA in populations of cells or in individual cells, Annexin-V analysis that measures alterations in plasma membranes, detection of apoptosis related proteins such p53 and Fas. A cell-based assay typically proceeds with exposing the target cells (e.g., in a culture medium) to a test compound which is a potential mTorC1 and/or mTorC2 selective inhibitor, and then assaying for readout under investigation. Depending on the nature of the candidate mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitors, they can directly be added to the cells or in conjunction with carriers. For instance, when the agent is nucleic acid, it can be added to the cell culture by methods well known in the art, which include without limitation calcium phosphate precipitation, microinjection or electroporation. Alternatively, the nucleic acid can be incorporated into an expression or insertion vector for incorporation into the cells. Vectors that contain both a promoter and a cloning site into which a polynucleotide can be operatively linked are well known in the art. Such vectors are capable of transcribing RNA in vitro or in vivo, and are commercially available from sources such as Stratagene (La Jolla, Calif.) and Promega Biotech (Madison, Wis.). In order to optimize expression and/or in vitro transcription, it may be necessary to remove, add or alter 5′ and/or 3′ untranslated portions of the clones to eliminate extra, potential inappropriate alternative translation initiation codons or other sequences that may interfere with or reduce expression, either at the level of transcription or translation. Alternatively, consensus ribosome binding sites can be inserted immediately 5′ of the start codon to enhance expression. Examples of vectors are viruses, such as baculovirus and retrovirus, bacteriophage, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, cosmid, plasmid, fungal vectors and other recombination vehicles typically used in the art which have been described for expression in a variety of eukaryotic and prokaryotic hosts, and may be used for gene therapy as well as for simple protein expression. Among these are several non-viral vectors, including DNA/liposome complexes, and targeted viral protein DNA complexes. To enhance delivery to a cell, the nucleic acid or proteins of this invention can be conjugated to antibodies or binding fragments thereof which bind cell surface antigens. Liposomes that also comprise a targeting antibody or fragment thereof can be used in the methods of this invention. Other biologically acceptable carriers can be utilized, including those described in, for example, REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES, 19th Ed. (2000), in conjunction with the subject compounds. Additional methods for cell-based assays for determining effects of agents on cell-cycle progression are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,612,189, incorporated herein by reference. In practicing the subject methods, any cells that express PI3-kinase α, mTorC1, mTorC2 and/or Akt can be target cells. Non-limiting examples of specific cell types whose proliferation can be inhibited include fibroblast, cells of skeletal tissue (bone and cartilage), cells of epithelial tissues (e.g. liver, lung, breast, skin, bladder and kidney), cardiac and smooth muscle cells, neural cells (glia and neurones), endocrine cells (adrenal, pituitary, pancreatic islet cells), melanocytes, and many different types of haemopoietic cells (e.g., cells of B-cell or T-cell lineage, and their corresponding stem cells, lymphoblasts). Also of interest are cells exhibiting a neoplastic propensity or phenotype. Of particular interest is the type of cells that differentially expresses (over-expresses or under-expresses) a disease-causing gene. The types of diseases involving abnormal functioning of genes include but are not limited to autoimmune diseases, cancer, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, neuronal and/or muscular degenerative diseases, cardiac diseases, endocrine disorders, and any combinations thereof.

For example, an inhibitor can be biological or chemical compound such as a simple or complex organic or inorganic molecule, peptide, peptide mimetic, protein (e.g. antibody), liposome, or a polynucleotide (e.g. small interfering RNA, microRNA, anti-sense, aptamer, ribozyme, or triple helix). Some exemplary classes of chemical compounds suitable for use in the subject methods are detailed in the sections below. The advantages of selective inhibition of a cellular target as a way of treating a disease condition mediated by such target are manifold. Because healthy cells depend on the signaling pathways that are activated in cancers for survival, inhibition of these pathways during cancer treatment can cause harmful side effects. In order for a method of treating cancer to be successful without causing excessive damage to healthy cells, a very high degree of specificity in targeting the aberrant signaling component or components is desirable. Moreover, cancer cells may depend on overactive signaling for their survival (known as the oncogene addiction hypothesis). In this way, cancer cells are frequently observed to adapt to drug inhibition of an aberrant signaling component by selecting for mutations in the same pathway that overcome the effect of the drug. Therefore, cancer therapies may be more successful in overcoming the problem of drug resistance if they target a signaling pathway as a whole, or target more than one component within a signaling pathway. One major downstream effector of mTOR signaling is the Akt serine/threonine kinase. Akt possesses a protein domain known as a PH domain, or Pleckstrin Homology domain, which binds to phosphoinositides with high affinity. In the case of the PH domain of Akt, it binds either PIP3 (phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) or PIP2 (phosphatidylinositol (3,4)-bisphosphate, PtdIns(3,4)P2). PI3K phosphorylates PIP2 in response to signals from chemical messengers, such as ligand binding to G protein-coupled receptors or receptor tyrosine kinases. Phosphorylation by PI3K converts PIP2 to PIP3, recruiting Akt to the cell membrane where it is phosphorylated at serine 473 (S473) by mTORC2. Phosphorylation of Akt at another site, threonine 308 (T308), is not directly dependent on mTORC2, but requires PI3K activity. Therefore, PI3K activity towards Akt can be isolated from mTOR activity by examining Akt threonine 308 phosphorylation status in cells lacking mTORC2 activity.

Materials used herein are either commercially available or prepared by synthetic methods generally known in the art. These schemes are not limited to the compounds listed or by any particular substituents employed for illustrative purposes. Numbering does not necessarily correspond to that of claims or other tables. In one embodiment, compounds are synthesized by condensing a functionalized heterocycle A-1 with formamide, to provide a pyrazolopyrimidine A-2. The pyrazolopyrimidine is treated with N-iodosuccinimide, which introduces an iodo substituent in the pyrazole ring as in A-3. The R1 substituent is introduced by reacting the pyrazolopyrimidine A3 with a compound of Formula R1-Lg in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate to produce a compound of Formula A-4. Other bases that are suitable for use in this step include but are not limited to sodium hydride and potassium t-butoxide. The compound of Formula R1-Lg has a moiety R1 as defined for R1 of a compound of Formula I-A, and wherein Lg is an appropriate leaving group such as halide (including bromo, iodo, and chloro), tosylate, or other suitable leaving group, The substituents corresponding to M1 are thereafter introduced by reacting aryl or heteroaryl boronic acids with the compound of Formula A-4 to obtain compound A-5. Alternatively, Mitsunobu chemistry can be used to obtain alkylated pyrazolopyrimidine A-4, as shown in Scheme A-1. Iodopyrazolopyrimidine A-3 is reacted with a suitable alcohol, in the presence of triphenylphosphine and diisopropylazodicarboxylate (DIAD) to produce pyrazolopyrimidine A-4. The compounds of the invention may be synthesized via a reaction scheme represented generally in Scheme B. The synthesis proceeds via coupling a compound of Formula A with a compound of Formula B to yield a compound of Formula C. The coupling step is typically catalyzed by using, e.g., a palladium catalyst, including but not limited to palladium tetrakis (triphenylphosphine). The coupling is generally performed in the presence of a suitable base, a nonlimiting example being sodium carbonate. One example of a suitable solvent for the reaction is aqueous dioxane. A compound of Formula A for use in Scheme B has a structure of Formula A, wherein T1 is triflate or halo (including bromo, chloro, and iodo), and wherein R1, X1, X2, X3, R31 and R32 are defined as for a compound of Formula I-A. For boronic acids and acid derivatives as depicted in Formula B, M is either M1 or M2. M1 is defined as for a compound of Formula I-A. For example, M1 can be a 5-benzoxazolyl or a 6-benzoxazolyl moiety, including but not limited to those M1 moieties disclosed herein. M2 is a moiety which is synthetically transformed to form M1, after the M2 moiety has been coupled to the bicyclic core of the compound of Formula A.

Disease Targets The subject methods are useful for treating any disease conditions, for example diseases for which current treatment regimens result in adverse events, limited tolerability, or patient non-compliance. In some embodiments, the disease condition is a proliferative disorder, such as described herein, including but not limited to cancer. In other embodiments, the disorder is diabetes. In still other embodiments, the disorder is an autoimmune disorder. In some embodiments, the disease condition is associated with mTor and/or PI3-kinase. A vast diversity of disease conditions associated with mTOR and/or PI3-kinase have been reported. PI3-kinase α, one of the four isoforms of type I PI3-kinases has been implicated, for example, in a variety of human proliferative disorders, such as cancers. Angiogenesis has been shown to selectively require the α isoform of PI3K in the control of endothelial cell migration. (Graupera et al, Nature 2008; 453; 662-6). Mutations in the gene coding for PI3K α or mutations which lead to upregulation of PI3K α are believed to occur in many human cancers such as lung, stomach, endometrial, ovarian, bladder, breast, colon, brain and skin cancers. Often, mutations in the gene coding for PI3K α are point mutations clustered within several hotspots in helical and kinase domains, such as E542, E545, and H1047. Many of these mutations have been shown to be oncogenic gain-of-function mutations. Because of the high rate of PI3K α mutations, targeting of this pathway provides valuable therapeutic opportunities. While other PI3K isoforms such as PI3K δ or PI3K γ are expressed primarily in hematopoietic cells, PI3K α, along with PI3K β, is expressed constitutively. Disease conditions associated with PI3-kinase and/or mTOR can also be characterized by abnormally high level of activity and/or expression of downstream messengers of mTOR and PI3-kinase. For example, proteins or messengers such as PIP2, PIP3, PDK, Akt, PTEN, PRAS40, GSK-3β, p21, p27 may be present in abnormal amounts which can be identified by any assays known in the art. Deregulation of the mTOR pathway is emerging as a common theme in diverse human diseases and as a consequence drugs that target mTOR have therapeutic value. The diseases associated with deregulation of mTORC1 include, but are not limited to, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), both of which are caused by mutations in TSC1 or TSC2 tumor suppressors. Patients with TSC develop benign tumors that when present in brain, however, can cause seizures, mental retardation and death. LAM is a serious lung disease. Inhibition of mTORC1 may help patients with Peutz-Jeghers cancer-prone syndrome caused by the LKB 1 mutation. mTORC1 may also have role in the genesis of sporadic cancers. Inactivation of several tumor suppressors, in particular PTEN, p53, VHL and NF1, has been linked to mTORC1 activation. Rapamycin and its analogues (eg CCl-779, RAD001 and AP23573) inhibit TORC1 and have shown moderate anti-cancer activity in phase II clinical trials. However, due to the negative signal from S6K1 to the insulin/PI3K/Akt pathway, it is important to note that inhibitors of mTORC1, like rapalogs, can activate PKB/Akt. If this effect persists with chronic rapamycin treatment, it may provide cancer cells with an increased survival signal that may be clinically undesirable. The PI3K/Akt pathway is activated in many cancers. Activated Akt regulates cell survival, cell proliferation and metabolism by phosphorylating proteins such as BAD, FOXO, NF-KB, p21Cip1, p27Kipl, GSK3β and others. Akt might also promote cell growth by phosphorylating TSC2. Akt activation may promote cellular transformation and resistance to apoptosis by collectively promoting growth, proliferation and survival, while inhibiting apoptotic pathways. Where desired, the subject to be treated is tested prior to treatment using a diagnostic assay to determine the sensitivity of tumor cells to an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor. Any method known in the art that can determine the sensitivity of the tumor cells of a subject to an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor can be employed. In these methods one or more additional anti-cancer agents or treatments can be co-administered according to a treatment regimen of the invention using the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor, as judged to be appropriate by the administering physician given the prediction of the likely responsiveness of the subject to the combination of mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor, in combination with any additional circumstances pertaining to the individual subject. The data presented in the Examples herein below demonstrate that the anti-tumor effects of an intermittent regimen of the invention involving an agent which is an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor (where the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor is administered according to a treatment regimen) are superior to the anti-tumor effects of the agent administered daily.

Certain embodiments contemplate a human subject such as a subject that has been diagnosed as having or being at risk for developing or acquiring a proliferative disorder condition. Certain other embodiments contemplate a non-human subject, for example a non-human primate such as a macaque, chimpanzee, gorilla, vervet, orangutan, baboon or other non-human primate, including such non-human subjects that can be known to the art as preclinical models, including preclinical models for inflammatory disorders. Certain other embodiments contemplate a non-human subject that is a mammal, for example, a mouse, rat, rabbit, pig, sheep, horse, bovine, goat, gerbil, hamster, guinea pig or other mammal There are also contemplated other embodiments in which the subject or biological source can be a non-mammalian vertebrate, for example, another higher vertebrate, or an avian, amphibian or reptilian species, or another subject or biological source. In certain embodiments of the present invention, a transgenic animal is utilized. A transgenic animal is a non-human animal in which one or more of the cells of the animal includes a nucleic acid that is non-endogenous (i.e., heterologous) and is present as an extrachromosomal element in a portion of its cell or stably integrated into its germ line DNA (i.e., in the genomic sequence of most or all of its cells). Therapeutic Efficacy In some embodiments, therapeutic efficacy is measured based on an effect of treating a proliferative disorder, such as cancer. In general, therapeutic efficacy of the methods and compositions of the invention, with regard to the treatment of a proliferative disorder (e.g. cancer, whether benign or malignant), may be measured by the degree to which the methods and compositions promote inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, the inhibition of tumor vascularization, the eradication of tumor cells, and/or a reduction in the size of at least one tumor such that a human is treated for the proliferative disorder. Several parameters to be considered in the determination of therapeutic efficacy are discussed herein. The proper combination of parameters for a particular situation can be established by the clinician. The progress of the inventive method in treating cancer (e.g., reducing tumor size or eradicating cancerous cells) can be ascertained using any suitable method, such as those methods currently used in the clinic to track tumor size and cancer progress. The primary efficacy parameter used to evaluate the treatment of cancer by the inventive method and compositions preferably is a reduction in the size of a tumor. Tumor size can be figured using any suitable technique, such as measurement of dimensions, or estimation of tumor volume using available computer software, such as FreeFlight software developed at Wake Forest University that enables accurate estimation of tumor volume. Tumor size can be determined by tumor visualization using, for example, CT, ultrasound, SPECT, spiral CT, MRI, photographs, and the like. In embodiments where a tumor is surgically resected after completion of the therapeutic period, the presence of tumor tissue and tumor size can be determined by gross analysis of the tissue to be resected, and/or by pathological analysis of the resected tissue. In some embodiments, tumor size is reduced as a result of the inventive method preferably without significant adverse events in the subject. Adverse events are categorized or “graded” by the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), with Grade 0 representing minimal adverse side effects and Grade 4 representing the most severe adverse events. The NCI toxicity scale (published April 1999) and Common Toxicity Criteria Manual (updated August 1999) is available through the NCI, e.g., through the NCI internet website at www.ctep.info.nih.gov or in the Investigator's Handbook for participants in clinical trials of investigational agents sponsored by the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, NCI. Desirably, the inventive method is associated with minimal adverse events, e.g. Grade 0, Grade 1, or Grade 2 adverse events, as graded by the CTEP/NCI. As discussed herein, reduction of tumor size, although preferred, is not required in that the actual size of tumor may not shrink despite the eradication of tumor cells. Eradication of cancerous cells is sufficient to realize a therapeutic effect. Likewise, any reduction in tumor size is sufficient to realize a therapeutic effect. Desirably, the growth of a tumor is stabilized (i.e., one or more tumors do not increase more than 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20% in size, and/or do not metastasize) as a result of the inventive method and compositions. Such stabilization may be evidenced by a longer period of stable disease as chracterized by the RECIST guidelines. In some embodiments, a tumor is stabilized for at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or more weeks. In some embodiments, a tumor is stabilized for at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or more months. In some embodiments, a tumor is stabilized for at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more years. Preferably, the inventive method reduces the size of a tumor at least about 5% (e.g., at least about 10%, 15%, 20%, or 25%). More preferably, tumor size is reduced at least about 30% (e.g., at least about 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, or 65%). Even more preferably, tumor size is reduced at least about 70% (e.g., at least about 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, or 95%). Most preferably, the tumor is completely eliminated, or reduced below a level of detection. In some embodiments, a subject remains tumor free (e.g. in remission) for at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or more weeks following treatment. In some embodiments, a subject remains tumor free for at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, or more months following treatment. In some embodiments, a subject remains tumor free for at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more years after treatment. When a tumor is subject to surgical resection following completion of the therapeutic period, the efficacy of the inventive method in reducing tumor size can be determined by measuring the percentage of resected tissue that is necrotic (i.e., dead). In some embodiments, a treatment is therapeutically effective if the necrosis percentage of the resected tissue is greater than about 20% (e.g., at least about 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100%), more preferably about 90% or greater (e.g., about 90%, 95%, or 100%). Most preferably, the necrosis percentage of the resected tissue is 100%, that is, no tumor tissue is present or detectable. A number of secondary parameters can be employed to determine the efficacy of the inventive method. Examples of secondary parameters include, but are not limited to, detection of new tumors, detection of tumor antigens or markers (e.g., CEA, PSA, or CA-125), biopsy, surgical downstaging (i.e., conversion of the surgical stage of a tumor from unresectable to resectable), PET scans, survival, disease progression-free survival, time to disease progression, quality of life assessments such as the Clinical Benefit Response Assessment, and the like, all of which can point to the overall progression (or regression) of cancer in a human. Biopsy is particularly useful in detecting the eradication of cancerous cells within a tissue. Radioimmunodetection (RAID) is used to locate and stage tumors using serum levels of markers (antigens) produced by and/or associated with tumors (“tumor markers” or “tumor-associated antigens”), and can be useful as a pre-treatment diagnostic predicate, a post-treatment diagnostic indicator of recurrence, and a post-treatment indicator of therapeutic efficacy. Examples of tumor markers or tumor-associated antigens that can be evaluated as indicators of therapeutic efficacy include, but are not limited to, carcinembryonic antigen (CEA) prostate-specific antigen (PSA), CA-125, CA19-9, ganglioside molecules (e.g., GM2, GD2, and GD3), MART-1, heat shock proteins (e.g., gp96), sialyl Tn (STn), tyrosinase, MUC-1, HER-2/neu, c-erb-B2, KSA, PSMA, p53, RAS, EGF-R, VEGF, MAGE, and gp100. Other tumor-associated antigens are known in the art. RAID technology in combination with endoscopic detection systems also efficiently distinguishes small tumors from surrounding tissue (see, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,932,412). Desirably, in accordance with the inventive method, the treatment of cancer in a human patient is evidenced by one or more of the following results: (a) the complete disappearance of a tumor (i.e., a complete response), (b) about a 25% to about a 50% reduction in the size of a tumor for at least four weeks after completion of the therapeutic period as compared to the size of the tumor before treatment, (c) at least about a 50% reduction in the size of a tumor for at least four weeks after completion of the therapeutic period as compared to the size of the tumor before the therapeutic period, (d) at least a 2% decrease (e.g., about a 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% or 90% decrease) in a specific tumor-associated antigen level at about 4-12 weeks after completion of the therapeutic period as compared to the tumor-associated antigen level before the therapeutic period or (e) a longer period of stable disease, for example longer by 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 months. While at least a 2% decrease in a tumor-associated antigen level is preferred, any decrease in the tumor-associated antigen level is evidence of treatment of a cancer in a patient by the inventive method. For example, with respect to unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer, treatment can be evidenced by at least a 10% decrease in the CA19-9 tumor-associated antigen level at 4-12 weeks after completion of the therapeutic period as compared to the CA19-9 level before the therapeutic period. Similarly, with respect to locally advanced rectal cancer, treatment can be evidenced by at least a 10% decrease in the CEA tumor-associated antigen level at 4-12 weeks after completion of the therapeutic period as compared to the CEA level before the therapeutic period. With respect to quality of life assessments, such as the Clinical Benefit Response Criteria, the therapeutic benefit of the treatment in accordance with the invention can be evidenced in terms of pain intensity, analgesic consumption, and/or the Karnofsky Performance Scale score. The Karnofsky Performance Scale allows patients to be classified according to their functional impairment. The Karnofsky Performance Scale is scored from 0-100. In general, a lower Karnofsky score is predictive of a poor prognosis for survival. Thus, the treatment of cancer in a human patient alternatively, or in addition, is evidenced by (a) at least a 50% decrease (e.g., at least a 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100% decrease) in pain intensity reported by a patient, such as for any consecutive four week period in the 12 weeks after completion of treatment, as compared to the pain intensity reported by the patient before treatment, (b) at least a 50% decrease (e.g., at least a 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100% decrease) in analgesic consumption reported by a patient, such as for any consecutive four week period in the 12 weeks after completion of treatment as compared to the analgesic consumption reported by the patient before treatment, and/or (c) at least a 20 point increase (e.g., at least a 30 point, 50 point, 70 point, or 90 point increase) in the Karnofsky Performance Scale score reported by a patient, such as for any consecutive four week period in the 12 weeks after completion of the therapeutic period as compared to the Karnofsky Performance Scale score reported by the patient before the therapeutic period. The treatment of a proliferative disorder (e.g. cancer, whether benign or malignant) in a human patient desirably is evidenced by one or more (in any combination) of the foregoing results, although alternative or additional results of the referenced tests and/or other tests can evidence treatment efficacy. Detection, monitoring, and rating of various cancers in a human are further described in Cancer Facts and Figures 2001, American Cancer Society, New York, N.Y., and International Patent Application WO 01/24684. Accordingly, a clinician can use standard tests to determine the efficacy of the various embodiments of the inventive method in treating cancer. However, in addition to tumor size and spread, the clinician also may consider quality of life and survival of the subject in evaluating efficacy of treatment. In some embodiments, administration of an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor according to an intermittent regiment of the invention provides improved therapeutic efficacy over a treatment where the inhibitor is administered daily. Improved efficacy may be measured using any method known in the art, including but not limited to those described herein. In some embodiments, the improved therapeutic efficacy is an improvement of at least about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 90%, 95%, 100%, 110%, 120%, 150%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%, 600%, 700%, 1000%, 10000% or more, using an appropriate measure (e.g. tumor size reduction, duration of tumor size stability, duration of time free from metastatic events, duration of disease-free survival). Improved efficacy may also be expressed as fold improvement, such as at least about 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, 5-fold, 6-fold, 7-fold, 8-fold, 9-fold, 10-fold, 20-fold, 30-fold, 40-fold, 50-fold, 60-fold, 70-fold, 80-fold, 90-fold, 100-fold, 1000-fold, 10000-fold, or more, using an appropriate measure (e.g. tumor size reduction, duration of tumor size stability, duration of time free from metastatic events, duration of disease-free survival). Pharmaceutical Compositions and Administration The subject pharmaceutical compositions are typically formulated to provide a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the present invention as the active ingredient, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, prodrug, solvate, hydrate or derivative thereof. Where desired, the pharmaceutical compositions contain pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or coordination complex thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers, including inert solid diluents and fillers, diluents, including sterile aqueous solution and various organic solvents, permeation enhancers, solubilizers and adjuvants.

The compounds according to the invention are effective over a wide dosage range. For example, in the treatment of adult humans, dosages from 0.01 to 1000 mg, from 0.5 to 100 mg, from 1 to 50 mg per day, and from 5 to 40 mg per day are examples of dosages that may be used. An exemplary dosage is 10 to 30 mg per day. The exact dosage will depend upon the route of administration, the form in which the compound is administered, the subject to be treated, the body weight of the subject to be treated, and the preference and experience of the attending physician. A pharmaceutical composition of the invention typically contains an active ingredient (e.g., a compound) of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and/or coordination complex thereof, and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, carriers, including but not limited to inert solid diluents and fillers, diluents, sterile aqueous solution and various organic solvents, permeation enhancers, solubilizers and adjuvants. Described below are non-limiting exemplary pharmaceutical compositions and methods for preparing the same. Pharmaceutical Compositions for Oral Administration. In some embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for oral administration containing a compound of the invention, and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments, the invention provides a solid pharmaceutical composition for oral administration containing: (i) an effective amount of a compound of the invention; optionally (ii) an effective amount of a second agent; and (iii) a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for oral administration. In some embodiments, the composition further contains: (iv) an effective amount of a third agent. In some embodiments, the pharmaceutical composition may be a liquid pharmaceutical composition suitable for oral consumption. Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention suitable for oral administration can be presented as discrete dosage forms, such as capsules, cachets, or tablets, or liquids or aerosol sprays each containing a predetermined amount of an active ingredient as a powder or in granules, a solution, or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. Such dosage forms can be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy, but all methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier, which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet can be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with an excipient such as, but not limited to, a binder, a lubricant, an inert diluent, and/or a surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets can be made by molding in a suitable machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. This invention further encompasses anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms comprising an active ingredient, since water can facilitate the degradation of some compounds. For example, water may be added (e.g., 5%) in the pharmaceutical arts as a means of simulating long-term storage in order to determine characteristics such as shelf-life or the stability of formulations over time. Anhydrous pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention can be prepared using anhydrous or low moisture containing ingredients and low moisture or low humidity conditions. Pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention which contain lactose can be made anhydrous if substantial contact with moisture and/or humidity during manufacturing, packaging, and/or storage is expected. An anhydrous pharmaceutical composition may be prepared and stored such that its anhydrous nature is maintained. Accordingly, anhydrous compositions may be packaged using materials known to prevent exposure to water such that they can be included in suitable formulary kits. Examples of suitable packaging include, but are not limited to, hermetically sealed foils, plastic or the like, unit dose containers, blister packs, and strip packs. An active ingredient can be combined in an intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. In preparing the compositions for an oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media can be employed as carriers, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents, and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations (such as suspensions, solutions, and elixirs) or aerosols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, micro-crystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, and disintegrating agents can be used in the case of oral solid preparations, in some embodiments without employing the use of lactose. For example, suitable carriers include powders, capsules, and tablets, with the solid oral preparations. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Binders suitable for use in pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms include, but are not limited to, corn starch, potato starch, or other starches, gelatin, natural and synthetic gums such as acacia, sodium alginate, alginic acid, other alginates, powdered tragacanth, guar gum, cellulose and its derivatives (e.g., ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, carboxymethyl cellulose calcium, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose), polyvinyl pyrrolidone, methyl cellulose, pre-gelatinized starch, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, and mixtures thereof. Examples of suitable fillers for use in the pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms disclosed herein include, but are not limited to, talc, calcium carbonate (e.g., granules or powder), microcrystalline cellulose, powdered cellulose, dextrates, kaolin, mannitol, silicic acid, sorbitol, starch, pre-gelatinized starch, and mixtures thereof. Disintegrants may be used in the compositions of the invention to provide tablets that disintegrate when exposed to an aqueous environment. Too much of a disintegrant may produce tablets which may disintegrate in the bottle. Too little may be insufficient for disintegration to occur and may thus alter the rate and extent of release of the active ingredient(s) from the dosage form. Thus, a sufficient amount of disintegrant that is neither too little nor too much to detrimentally alter the release of the active ingredient(s) may be used to form the dosage forms of the compounds disclosed herein. The amount of disintegrant used may vary based upon the type of formulation and mode of administration, and may be readily discernible to those of ordinary skill in the art. About 0.5 to about 15 weight percent of disintegrant, or about 1 to about 5 weight percent of disintegrant, may be used in the pharmaceutical composition. Disintegrants that can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, agar-agar, alginic acid, calcium carbonate, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, crospovidone, polacrilin potassium, sodium starch glycolate, potato or tapioca starch, other starches, pre-gelatinized starch, other starches, clays, other aligns, other celluloses, gums or mixtures thereof. Lubricants which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oil, light mineral oil, glycerin, sorbitol, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, other glycols, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talc, hydrogenated vegetable oil (e.g., peanut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil, and soybean oil), zinc stearate, ethyl oleate, ethyl laureate, agar, or mixtures thereof. Additional lubricants include, for example, a syloid silica gel, a coagulated aerosol of synthetic silica, or mixtures thereof. A lubricant can optionally be added, in an amount of less than about 1 weight percent of the pharmaceutical composition. When aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs are desired for oral administration, the active ingredient therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents, coloring matter or dyes and, if so desired, emulsifying and/or suspending agents, together with such diluents as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin and various combinations thereof. The tablets can be uncoated or coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate can be employed. Formulations for oral use can also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example, peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil. Surfactant which can be used to form pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms of the invention include, but are not limited to, hydrophilic surfactants, lipophilic surfactants, and mixtures thereof. That is, a mixture of hydrophilic surfactants may be employed, a mixture of lipophilic surfactants may be employed, or a mixture of at least one hydrophilic surfactant and at least one lipophilic surfactant may be employed. A suitable hydrophilic surfactant may generally have an HLB value of at least 10, while suitable lipophilic surfactants may generally have an HLB value of or less than about 10. An empirical parameter used to characterize the relative hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of non-ionic amphiphilic compounds is the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (“HLB” value). Surfactants with lower HLB values are more lipophilic or hydrophobic, and have greater solubility in oils, while surfactants with higher HLB values are more hydrophilic, and have greater solubility in aqueous solutions. Hydrophilic surfactants are generally considered to be those compounds having an HLB value greater than about 10, as well as anionic, cationic, or zwitterionic compounds for which the HLB scale is not generally applicable. Similarly, lipophilic (i.e., hydrophobic) surfactants are compounds having an HLB value equal to or less than about 10. However, HLB value of a surfactant is merely a rough guide generally used to enable formulation of industrial, pharmaceutical and cosmetic emulsions. Hydrophilic surfactants may be either ionic or non-ionic. Suitable ionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, alkylammonium salts; fusidic acid salts; fatty acid derivatives of amino acids, oligopeptides, and polypeptides; glyceride derivatives of amino acids, oligopeptides, and polypeptides; lecithins and hydrogenated lecithins; lysolecithins and hydrogenated lysolecithins; phospholipids and derivatives thereof; lysophospholipids and derivatives thereof; carnitine fatty acid ester salts; salts of alkylsulfates; fatty acid salts; sodium docusate; acyl lactylates; mono- and di-acetylated tartaric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; succinylated mono- and di-glycerides; citric acid esters of mono- and di-glycerides; and mixtures thereof.

In one embodiment, the composition may include a solubilizer to ensure good solubilization and/or dissolution of the compound of the present invention and to minimize precipitation of the compound of the present invention. This can be especially important for compositions for non-oral use, e.g., compositions for injection. A solubilizer may also be added to increase the solubility of the hydrophilic drug and/or other components, such as surfactants, or to maintain the composition as a stable or homogeneous solution or dispersion. Examples of suitable solubilizers include, but are not limited to, the following: alcohols and polyols, such as ethanol, isopropanol, butanol, benzyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butanediols and isomers thereof, glycerol, pentaerythritol, sorbitol, mannitol, transcutol, dimethyl isosorbide, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyvinylalcohol, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and other cellulose derivatives, cyclodextrins and cyclodextrin derivatives; ethers of polyethylene glycols having an average molecular weight of about 200 to about 6000, such as tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol PEG ether (glycofurol) or methoxy PEG; amides and other nitrogen-containing compounds such as 2-pyrrolidone, 2-piperidone, ε-caprolactam, N-alkylpyrrolidone, N-hydroxyalkylpyrrolidone, N-alkylpiperidone, N-alkylcaprolactam, dimethylacetamide and polyvinylpyrrolidone; esters such as ethyl propionate, tributylcitrate, acetyl triethylcitrate, acetyl tributyl citrate, triethylcitrate, ethyl oleate, ethyl caprylate, ethyl butyrate, triacetin, propylene glycol monoacetate, propylene glycol diacetate, ε-caprolactone and isomers thereof, δ-valerolactone and isomers thereof, β-butyrolactone and isomers thereof; and other solubilizers known in the art, such as dimethyl acetamide, dimethyl isosorbide, N-methylpyrrolidones, monooctanoin, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, and water.

Particularly preferred solubilizers include sorbitol, glycerol, triacetin, ethyl alcohol, PEG-400, glycofurol and propylene glycol. The amount of solubilizer that can be included is not particularly limited. The amount of a given solubilizer may be limited to a bioacceptable amount, which may be readily determined by one of skill in the art. In some circumstances, it may be advantageous to include amounts of solubilizers far in excess of bioacceptable amounts, for example to maximize the concentration of the drug, with excess solubilizer removed prior to providing the composition to a subject using conventional techniques, such as distillation or evaporation. Thus, if present, the solubilizer can be in a weight ratio of 10%, 25%, 50%, 100%, or up to about 200% by weight, based on the combined weight of the drug, and other excipients. If desired, very small amounts of solubilizer may also be used, such as 5%, 2%, 1% or even less. Typically, the solubilizer may be present in an amount of about 1% to about 100%, more typically about 5% to about 25% by weight. The composition can further include one or more pharmaceutically acceptable additives and excipients. Such additives and excipients include, without limitation, detackifiers, anti-foaming agents, buffering agents, polymers, antioxidants, preservatives, chelating agents, viscomodulators, tonicifiers, flavorants, colorants, odorants, opacifiers, suspending agents, binders, fillers, plasticizers, lubricants, and mixtures thereof. In addition, an acid or a base may be incorporated into the composition to facilitate processing, to enhance stability, or for other reasons. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable bases include amino acids, amino acid esters, ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, sodium hydrogen carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, calcium carbonate, magnesium hydroxide, magnesium aluminum silicate, synthetic aluminum silicate, synthetic hydrocalcite, magnesium aluminum hydroxide, diisopropylethylamine, ethanolamine, ethylenediamine, triethanolamine, triethylamine, triisopropanolamine, trimethylamine, tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) and the like.

In some embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for injection containing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for injection. Components and amounts of agents in the compositions are as described herein. The forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration by injection include aqueous or oil suspensions, or emulsions, with sesame oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, or peanut oil, as well as elixirs, mannitol, dextrose, or a sterile aqueous solution, and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Aqueous solutions in saline are also conventionally used for injection. Ethanol, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like (and suitable mixtures thereof), cyclodextrin derivatives, and vegetable oils may also be employed. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, for the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be brought about by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the compound of the present invention in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with various other ingredients as enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, certain desirable methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques which yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof. Pharmaceutical Compositions for Topical (e.g., Transdermal) Delivery. In some embodiments, the invention provides a pharmaceutical composition for transdermal delivery containing a compound of the present invention and a pharmaceutical excipient suitable for transdermal delivery. Compositions of the present invention can be formulated into preparations in solid, semi-solid, or liquid forms suitable for local or topical administration, such as gels, water soluble jellies, creams, lotions, suspensions, foams, powders, slurries, ointments, solutions, oils, pastes, suppositories, sprays, emulsions, saline solutions, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-based solutions. In general, carriers with higher densities are capable of providing an area with a prolonged exposure to the active ingredients. In contrast, a solution formulation may provide more immediate exposure of the active ingredient to the chosen area. The pharmaceutical compositions also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients, which are compounds that allow increased penetration of, or assist in the delivery of, therapeutic molecules across the stratum corneum permeability barrier of the skin. There are many of these penetration-enhancing molecules known to those trained in the art of topical formulation. Examples of such carriers and excipients include, but are not limited to, humectants (e.g., urea), glycols (e.g., propylene glycol), alcohols (e.g., ethanol), fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid), surfactants (e.g., isopropyl myristate and sodium lauryl sulfate), pyrrolidones, glycerol monolaurate, sulfoxides, terpenes (e.g., menthol), amines, amides, alkanes, alkanols, water, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols. Another exemplary formulation for use in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices (“patches”). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of a compound of the present invention in controlled amounts, either with or without another agent. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,023,252, 4,992,445 and 5,001,139. Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents. Pharmaceutical Compositions for Inhalation. Compositions for inhalation or insufflation include solutions and suspensions in pharmaceutically acceptable, aqueous or organic solvents, or mixtures thereof, and powders. The liquid or solid compositions may contain suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients as described supra. Preferably the compositions are administered by the oral or nasal respiratory route for local or systemic effect. Compositions in preferably pharmaceutically acceptable solvents may be nebulized by use of inert gases. Nebulized solutions may be inhaled directly from the nebulizing device or the nebulizing device may be attached to a face mask tent, or intermittent positive pressure breathing machine. Solution, suspension, or powder compositions may be administered, preferably orally or nasally, from devices that deliver the formulation in an appropriate manner. Other Pharmaceutical Compositions. Pharmaceutical compositions may also be prepared from compositions described herein and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients suitable for sublingual, buccal, rectal, intraosseous, intraocular, intranasal, epidural, or intraspinal administration. Preparations for such pharmaceutical compositions are well-known in the art. See, e.g., See, e.g., Anderson, Philip O.; Knoben, James E.; Troutman, William G, eds., Handbook of Clinical Drug Data, Tenth Edition, McGraw-Hill, 2002; Pratt and Taylor, eds., Principles of Drug Action, Third Edition, Churchill Livingston, New York, 1990; Katzung, ed., Basic and Clinical Pharmacology, Ninth Edition, McGraw Hill, 20037ybg; Goodman and Gilman, eds., The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Tenth Edition, McGraw Hill, 2001; Remingtons Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th Ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins., 2000; Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, Thirty-Second Edition (The Pharmaceutical Press, London, 1999); all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. Administration of the compounds or pharmaceutical composition of the present invention can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action. These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection (including intravenous, intraarterial, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular, intraperitoneal or infusion), topical (e.g. transdermal application), rectal administration, via local delivery by catheter or stent or through inhalation. Compounds can also be administered intraadiposally or intrathecally. The amount of the compound administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.05 to 7 g/day, preferably about 0.05 to about 2.5 g/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, e.g. by dividing such larger doses into several small doses for administration throughout the day. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered in a single dose. Typically, such administration will be by injection, e.g., intravenous injection, in order to introduce the agent quickly. However, other routes may be used as appropriate. A single dose of a compound of the invention may also be used for treatment of an acute condition. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered in multiple doses. Dosing may be about once, twice, three times, four times, five times, six times, or more than six times per day. Dosing may be about once a month, once every two weeks, once a week, or once every other day. In another embodiment a compound of the invention and another agent are administered together about once per day to about 6 times per day. In another embodiment the administration of a compound of the invention and an agent continues for less than about 7 days. In yet another embodiment the administration continues for more than about 6, 10, 14, 28 days, two months, six months, or one year. In some cases, continuous dosing is achieved and maintained as long as necessary. Administration of the compounds of the invention may continue as long as necessary. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered for more than 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, or 28 days. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered for less than 28, 14, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 day. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is administered chronically on an ongoing basis, e.g., for the treatment of chronic effects. An effective amount of a compound of the invention may be administered in either single or multiple doses by any of the accepted modes of administration of agents having similar utilities, including rectal, buccal, intranasal and transdermal routes, by intra-arterial injection, intravenously, intraperitoneally, parenterally, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, orally, topically, or as an inhalant. The compositions of the invention may also be delivered via an impregnated or coated device such as a stent, for example, or an artery-inserted cylindrical polymer. Such a method of administration may, for example, aid in the prevention or amelioration of restenosis following procedures such as balloon angioplasty. Without being bound by theory, compounds of the invention may slow or inhibit the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall which contribute to restenosis. A compound of the invention may be administered, for example, by local delivery from the struts of a stent, from a stent graft, from grafts, or from the cover or sheath of a stent. In some embodiments, a compound of the invention is admixed with a matrix. Such a matrix may be a polymeric matrix, and may serve to bond the compound to the stent. Polymeric matrices suitable for such use, include, for example, lactone-based polyesters or copolyesters such as polylactide, polycaprolactonglycolide, polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides, polyaminoacids, polysaccharides, polyphosphazenes, poly(ether-ester) copolymers (e.g. PEO-PLLA); polydimethylsiloxane, poly(ethylene-vinylacetate), acrylate-based polymers or copolymers (e.g. polyhydroxyethyl methylmethacrylate, polyvinyl pyrrolidinone), fluorinated polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene and cellulose esters. Suitable matrices may be nondegrading or may degrade with time, releasing the compound or compounds. Compounds of the invention may be applied to the surface of the stent by various methods such as dip/spin coating, spray coating, dip-coating, and/or brush-coating. The compounds may be applied in a solvent and the solvent may be allowed to evaporate, thus forming a layer of compound onto the stent. Alternatively, the compound may be located in the body of the stent or graft, for example in microchannels or micropores. When implanted, the compound diffuses out of the body of the stent to contact the arterial wall. Such stents may be prepared by dipping a stent manufactured to contain such micropores or microchannels into a solution of the compound of the invention in a suitable solvent, followed by evaporation of the solvent. Excess drug on the surface of the stent may be removed via an additional brief solvent wash. In yet other embodiments, compounds of the invention may be covalently linked to a stent or graft. A covalent linker may be used which degrades in vivo, leading to the release of the compound of the invention. Any bio-labile linkage may be used for such a purpose, such as ester, amide or anhydride linkages. Compounds of the invention may additionally be administered intravascularly from a balloon used during angioplasty. Extravascular administration of the compounds via the pericard or via advential application of formulations of the invention may also be performed to decrease restenosis. A variety of stent devices which may be used as described are disclosed, for example, in the following references, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference: U.S. Pat. No. 5,451,233; U.S. Pat. No. 5,040,548; U.S. Pat. No. 5,061,273; U.S. Pat. No. 5,496,346; U.S. Pat. No. 5,292,331; U.S. Pat. No. 5,674,278; U.S. Pat. No. 3,657,744; U.S. Pat. No. 4,739,762; U.S. Pat.

They are most often prescribed for skin and joint symptoms of lupus. Azathioprine (Imuran) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) suppress inflammation and tend to suppress the immune system. Other agents, e.g., methotrexate and cyclosporin are used to control the symptoms of lupus. Anticoagulants are employed to prevent blood from clotting rapidly. They range from aspirin at very low dose which prevents platelets from sticking, to heparin/coumadin. In one aspect, this invention also relates to methods and pharmaceutical compositions for inhibiting abnormal cell growth in a mammal which comprises an amount of an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, prodrug, solvate, hydrate or derivative thereof, in combination with an amount of an anti-cancer agent (e.g., a chemotherapeutic agent). Many chemotherapeutics are presently known in the art and can be used in combination with the compounds of the invention. This invention further relates to a method for using the compounds or pharmaceutical composition in combination with other tumor treatment approaches, including surgery, ionizing radiation, photodynamic therapy, or implants, e.g., with corticosteroids, hormones, or used as radiosensitizers. One such approach may be, for example, radiation therapy in inhibiting abnormal cell growth or treating the proliferative disorder in the mammal. Techniques for administering radiation therapy are known in the art, and these techniques can be used in the combination therapy described herein. The administration of the compound of the invention in this combination therapy can be determined as described herein. Radiation therapy can be administered through one of several methods, or a combination of methods, including without limitation external-beam therapy, internal radiation therapy, implant radiation, stereotactic radiosurgery, systemic radiation therapy, radiotherapy and permanent or temporary interstitial brachytherapy. The term “brachytherapy,” as used herein, refers to radiation therapy delivered by a spatially confined radioactive material inserted into the body at or near a tumor or other proliferative tissue disease site. The term is intended without limitation to include exposure to radioactive isotopes (e.g., At-211, I-131, I-125, Y-90, R2-186, R2-188, Sm-153, Bi-212, P-32, and radioactive isotopes of Lu). Suitable radiation sources for use as a cell conditioner of the present invention include both solids and liquids. By way of non-limiting example, the radiation source can be a radionuclide, such as I-125, I-131, Yb-169, Ir-192 as a solid source, I-125 as a solid source, or other radionuclides that emit photons, beta particles, gamma radiation, or other therapeutic rays. The radioactive material can also be a fluid made from any solution of radionuclide(s), e.g., a solution of I-125 or I-131, or a radioactive fluid can be produced using a slurry of a suitable fluid containing small particles of solid radionuclides, such as Au-198, Y-90. Moreover, the radionuclide(s) can be embodied in a gel or radioactive micro spheres. Without being limited by any theory, the compounds of the present invention can render abnormal cells more sensitive to treatment with radiation for purposes of killing and/or inhibiting the growth of such cells. Accordingly, this invention further relates to a method for sensitizing abnormal cells in a mammal to treatment with radiation which comprises administering to the mammal an amount of an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, prodrug, solvate, hydrate or derivative thereof, which combined amounts are effective in sensitizing abnormal cells to treatment with radiation. The amount of the compound, salt, or solvate in this method can be determined according to the means for ascertaining effective amounts of such compounds described herein. Photodynamic therapy includes therapy which uses certain chemicals known as photosensitizing compounds to treat or prevent cancers. Examples of photodynamic therapy include treatment with compounds, such as e.g., VISUDYNE and porfimer sodium. Angiostatic steroids include compounds which block or inhibit angiogenesis, such as, e.g., anecortave, triamcinolone, hydrocortisone, 11-α-epihydrocotisol, cortexolone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, corticosterone, desoxycorticosterone, testosterone, estrone and dexamethasone. Implants containing corticosteroids include compounds, such as e.g., fluocinolone and dexamethasone. Other chemotherapeutic compounds include, but are not limited to, plant alkaloids, hormonal compounds and antagonists; biological response modifiers, preferably lymphokines or interferons; antisense oligonucleotides or oligonucleotide derivatives; shRNA or siRNA; or miscellaneous compounds or compounds with other or unknown mechanism of action. The invention also relates to a method of and to a pharmaceutical composition of treating a cardiovascular disease in a mammal which comprises administering an amount of an mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, prodrug, solvate, hydrate or derivative thereof, or an isotopically-labeled derivative thereof, and, separately or in combination with the mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitor, administering an amount of one or more therapeutic agents useful for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Exemplary agents for use in cardiovascular disease applications are anti-thrombotic agents, e.g., prostacyclin and salicylates, thrombolytic agents, e.g., streptokinase, urokinase, tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and anisoylated plasminogen-streptokinase activator complex (APSAC), anti-platelets agents, e.g., acetyl-salicylic acid (ASA) and clopidrogel, vasodilating agents, e.g., nitrates, calcium channel blocking drugs, anti-proliferative agents, e.g., colchicine and alkylating agents, intercalating agents, growth modulating factors such as interleukins, transformation growth factor-beta and congeners of platelet derived growth factor, monoclonal antibodies directed against growth factors, anti-inflammatory agents, both steroidal and non-steroidal, and other agents that can modulate vessel tone, function, arteriosclerosis, and the healing response to vessel or organ injury post intervention. Antibiotics can also be included in combinations or coatings comprised by the invention. Moreover, a coating can be used to effect therapeutic delivery focally within the vessel wall. By incorporation of the active agent in a swellable polymer, the active agent will be released upon swelling of the polymer.

EXAMPLES Example 1 Expression and Inhibition Assays of mTOR Inhibition of mTor can be measured according to any procedures known in the art or methods disclosed below. The compounds described herein and any other mTorC1/mTorC2 inhibitors known in the art can be tested against recombinant mTOR (Invitrogen) in an assay containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM, 0.01% Tween, 10 μM ATP (2.5 μCi of μ-32P-ATP), and 3 μg/mL BSA. Rat recombinant PHAS-1/4EBP1 (Calbiochem; 2 mg/mL) is used as a substrate. Reactions are terminated by spotting onto nitrocellulose, which is washed with 1M NaCl/1% phosphoric acid (approximately 6 times, 5-10 minutes each). Sheets are dried and the transferred radioactivity quantitated by phosphorimaging. Other kits or systems for assaying mTOR activity are commercially available. For instance, one can use Invitrogen's LanthaScreen™ Kinase assay to test the inhibitors of mTOR disclosed herein. This assay is a time resolved FRET platform that measures the phosphorylation of GFP labeled 4EBP1 by mTOR kinase. The kinase reaction is performed in a white 384 well microtitre plate. The total reaction volume is 20 ul per well and the reaction buffer composition is 50 mM HEPES pH7.5, 0.01% Polysorbate 20, 1 mM EGTA, 10 mM MnCl2, and 2 mM DTT. In the first step, each well receives 2 ul of test compound in 20% dimethylsulphoxide resulting in a 2% DMSO final concentration. Next, 8 ul of mTOR diluted in reaction buffer is added per well for a 60 ng/ml final concentration. To start the reaction, 10 ul of an ATP/GFP-4EBP1 mixture (diluted in reaction buffer) is added per well for a final concentration of 10 μM ATP and 0.5 μM GFP-4EBP1. The plate is sealed and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature. The reaction is stopped by adding 10 ul per well of a Tb-anti-pT46 4EBP1 antibody/EDTA mixture (diluted in TR-FRET buffer) for a final concentration of 1.3 nM antibody and 6.7 mM EDTA. The plate is sealed, incubated for 1 hour at room temperature, and then read on a plate reader set up for LanthaScreen™ TR-FRET. Data is analyzed and IC50s are generated using GraphPad Prism 5. Example 2 Kinase Signaling Assays PI3K/Akt/mTor signaling is measured in blood cells using the phosflow method (Methods Enzymol. 2007; 434:131-54). The advantage of this method is that it is by nature a single cell assay so that cellular heterogeneity can be detected rather than population averages. This allows concurrent dinstinction of signaling states in different populations defined by other markers. Phosflow is also highly quantitative. Unfractionated splenocytes, or peripheral blood mononuclear cells are stimulated with anti-CD3 to initiate T-cell receptor signaling. The cells are then fixed and stained for surface markers and intracellular phosphoproteins. Human Peripheral Blood Mono-Nucleocyte Biomarker Assay. A BD Biosciences Phosflow assay was conducted using human peripheral blood cells. Whole blood was lysed and fixed using the provided BD Lyse/Fix buffer and permeabilized with BD Perm III buffer. Peripheral blood cells were isolated and stained using CD33 and CD20 as extracellular markers and p4E-BP1 (T37/46) as the intracellular biomarker. Cell type populations were identified as monocytes (CD33+), granulocytes (CD33 dim), lymphocytes (CD33−), B-cells (CD33−, CD20+) and T &NK cells (CD33−, CD20−) by FACS analysis. The median fluorescense intensity (MFI) of each cell type was analyzed along with the percentage of p4E-BP1 positive cells. Results are shown in FIG. 5. Human Skin Immunohistochemistry Assay. Skin tissue was fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin solution for 24 hours and then processed and embedded in paraffin block. Sections (4 μm) were cut and mounted onto microscopic slides. Sections were incubated with primary antibodies (p4EBP1, pS6, or pRAS40) overnight and developed using a chromogenic substrate. Example 3 Phase I Clinical Trial Adult patients with histologically confirmed advanced solid tumors were enrolled in a 3+3 dose escalation Phase I study evaluating 3 intermittent schedules of administration for compound A: QW (once weekly), QD×3d QW (3 days on 4 days off), and QD×5d QW (5 days on 2 days off), in comparison with daily dosing (QD). Safety, maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary antitumor activity were evaluated. Comparison of the treatment regimens of the invention showed consistent and dose-dependent PK as described in FIGS. 1-3. Compound A was absorbed with a Tmax ranging from 0.5 to 4 h and a mean elimination plasma t1/2 of 8 h. Plasma exposures (Cmax and AUC0-24) following oral doses suggest dose-linear plasma PK. Decreases in p4EBP1 levels were seen in PBC in all dosing regimens. Skin biopsies showed 60-100% pathway inhibition of TORC1 (p4EBP1 and pS6) and TORC2 (pPRAS40). Preliminary anti-tumor activity was seen in patients with lung and renal cancer. Pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints were evaluated in surrogate (peripheral blood cells [PBCs], skin) and tumor tissues for the phosphorylation of TORC1-dependent markers (4EBP1/S6), and TORC2-dependent markers (AKT/PRAS40). 50 patients were treated in 3 intermittent dosing regimens; 21 in 6 cohorts ranging 7-40 mg QW, 20 in 5 cohorts ranging 6-20 mg QDx3d QW, and 9 in 3 cohorts ranging 7-13 mg QDxSd QW. Dose limiting toxicities of Grade (G) 3 asthenia and G3 mucositis were reported in the 40 mg QW, 20 mg QDx3d QW; and 13 mg QDxSd QW cohorts. The MTD for intermittent dosing was not reached. All adverse events (AEs) reported were reversible. The most common (≧20%, n=35) AEs considered possibly related to compound A reported in all 3 dosing regimens included nausea (51%), hyperglycemia (37%), mucosal inflammation (29%), rash (23%), asthenia (23%), vomiting (26%), and diarrhea (20%). The majority of AEs considered possibly related to compound A in any regimen were Grade 1 or 2. The only reported Grade ≧3 AE (≧5%) possibly related to compound A in 3 regimens was lymphopenia (6%).
