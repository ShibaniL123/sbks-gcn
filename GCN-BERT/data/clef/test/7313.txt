FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to instant acidified milk beverages and methods for producing such instant acidified milk beverages. More specifically, the present invention provides a powdered composition which can be added to a milk product with minimal mixing to produce an instant acidified milk beverage having a smooth texture. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Attempts have been made to provide powdered compositions suitable for mixing with milk or water for the manufacture of non-gelled acidified, milk-product drinks. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,530,850 (Jul. 23, 1985) provided a powdered composition that, upon mixing with milk, formed a non-gelled, acidified, milk-product drink without curdling of the milk proteins. The powdered composition contained about 1 to about 9 percent of an edible acid, about 0.5 to about 1.9 percent of an instant cold-water soluble gelatin, about 1 to about 10 percent of an edible natural or modified polysaccharide gum, about 20 to about 90 percent sweetening agents, and an effective amount of flavoring and coloring agents. The beverage was prepared by vigorously mixing (e.g., in a blender at high speed for 10 seconds or in a shaker for an unlisted time) the powdered composition into milk. It was reported that the gelatin included in the powder became attached to the casein in the milk, thereby stabilizing the milk proteins at lower pH; the gum was reportedly used to improve the viscosity and texture of the final beverage product. Attempts to prepare the beverage of U.S. Pat. No. 4,530,850 without vigorous mixing (i.e., gently mixing with a spoon) by the present inventors were generally unsuccessful. U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/958,490, owned by the same assignee of the present invention, provided instant acidified milk beverages and methods for producing such instant acidified milk beverages. It also provided a powdered composition which can be added to a milk product with minimal mixing to produce an instant acidified milk beverage having a smooth texture. The powdered composition generally contained sugar, citric acid, a buffering or bite reducing agent, guar gum, artificial sweeteners, a calcium fortification agent, emulsifiers, and optional flavorings and colorants. Typically, the powdered composition disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/958,490 was combined with pasteurized liquid milk to provide the desired beverage. Most of the milk produced in Brazil is pasteurized using the ultra high temperature (“UHT”) method (i.e., typically 130° C. to 138° C. for two to four seconds). Thus, the inventors used only UHT pasteurized milk in developing their invention. It was assumed that this invention would work with milk independent of the pasteurization method used. It has now been determined that when the powdered composition disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/958,490 is combined with liquid milk pasteurized using the high temperature short time method (“HTST”), the milk frequently curdles. Since most milk produced in the United States is pasteurized using the HTST pasteurization method (typically at 71.5° C. for 15 seconds), the invention described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/958,490 has limited usefulness in the United States (or other locations where HTST pasteurization methods are used). The present invention overcomes this limitation of the co-owned invention because it provides a way of acidifying HTST milk products without producing any curds. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to instant acidified milk beverages and methods for producing such instant acidified milk beverages. More specifically, the present invention provides a powdered composition which can be added to a pasteurized liquid milk product, independent of the method used to pasteurize the milk, with minimal mixing to produce an instant acidified milk beverage having a smooth texture. Although the present invention can use either UHT or HTST pasteurized milk, it is especially useful for HTST pasteurized milk. The present invention provides a powdered composition for preparing an instant acidified milk beverage with a pH ranging from about 5.0 to about 6.2 using a pasteurized liquid milk product, comprising at least one edible monobasic salt of polyprotonic acid with a pKa less than about 4.4, and one or more optional ingredients such as sweetener, thickener, buffering salt, fiber, bulking agent, anti-caking agent, fruit juice solid, fortificants, flavorant and colorant. The powdered composition can be incorporated into the pasteurized liquid milk product, independent of the pasteurization method used, with minimal mixing to form an acidified milk beverage with a pH between 5.0 and 6.2, and good organoleptic properties. The edible monobasic salt of polyprotonic acid is selected from the group consisting of citrate, phosphate, malate, adipate, fumarate, tartarate, pyrophosphate, and mixtures thereof. In another aspect, the powdered composition may further include a buffer salt selected from the group consisting of dibasic mineral salts of citrate, dibasic mineral salts of phosphate, dibasic mineral salts of pyrophosphate, tribasic mineral salts of citrate, tribasic mineral salts of phosphate, tribasic mineral salts of pyrophosphate, dibasic mineral salts of malate, dibasic mineral salts of adipate, dibasic mineral salts of fumarate, and dibasic mineral salts of tartarate. DETAILED DESCRIPTION The invention relates to instant acidified milk beverages and methods for producing such instant acidified milk beverages. The present invention provides a powdered composition which can be added to any milk product (e.g., pasteurized by UHT or HTST technique as well as powdered milk reconstituted with water). The product is prepared with minimal mixing to produce an instant acidified milk beverage having a smooth texture. The powdered compositions comprise at least one edible monobasic salt of polyprotonic acid with pKa of 4.4 or below. Preferably, the edible monobasic salt of polyprotonic acid is selected from the group consisting of salts of citrate, phosphate, malate, adipate, fumarate, tartarate, pyrophosphate, and mixtures thereof. More preferably, the edible monobasic salt of polyprotonic acid is selected from group consisting of salts of citrate and phosphate. Most preferably, the edible monobasic salt of polyprotonic acid is a monobasic mineral salt selected from the group consisting of monopotassium citrate, monosodium citrate, monocalcium citrate, monomagnesium citrate, monopotassium phosphate, monosodium phosphate, monocalcium phosphate, monomagnesium phosphate, and mixtures thereof. The powdered composition of the present invention may further include a buffer salt selected from the group consisting of dibasic mineral salts of citrate, dibasic mineral salts of phosphate, dibasic mineral salts of pyrophosphate, tribasic mineral salts of citrate, tribasic mineral salts of phosphate, tribasic mineral salts of pyrophosphate, dibasic mineral salts of malate, dibasic mineral salts of adipate, dibasic mineral salts of fumarate, and dibasic mineral salts of tartarate. In a preferred embodiment, the buffer salt is selected from the group consisting of disodium citrate, trisodium citrate, dicalcium citrate, tricalcium citrate, dimagnesium citrate, trimagnesium citrate, disodium phosphate, trisodium phosphate, dipotassium phosphate, tripotassium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate, tricalcium phosphate, and mixtures thereof. The powdered compositions of the present invention include one or more optional ingredients such as sweetener, thickener, buffering salt, fiber, bulking agent such as maltodextrin and the like), anti-caking agent, fruit juice solid, fortificants, flavorant and colorant. The powdered compositions of the present invention may also contain optional colorants, minerals, prebiotics, or probiotics and/or fiber. The powdered composition does not require and is substantially free from common food grade acids such as citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, phosphoric acid, lactic acid, and the like. For purposes of the present invention, for the powdered composition to be “substantially free from common food grade acids” means that the amounts of common food grade acids present in the powdered composition, if any, does not result in curdling when the powdered composition is added to milk and minimal mixing. For example, the composition should generally contain about less than about 0.2 g citric acid per 240 mls of milk (or equivalent amounts of other common food grade acids), preferably about less than about 0.1 g per 240 mls of milk, and more preferably with no added common food grade acids. The amount of acid specified is the total in the powdered beverage composition, as other ingredients such as flavors and juice solids etc. may contain small amounts of food grade acids which contribute to the total level of acid in the composition. Accordingly, other components of the beverage may contain natural acids, so long as they do not cause curds to form in the beverage. When common food grade acids such as citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, phosphoric acid, lactic acid, and the like are used to acidify the beverage in HTST pasteurized milk, curds form in the beverage, which is not desirable. Although not wanting to be limited by theory, it is believed that the edible acidic monobasic mineral salt of polyprotonic acids has a lower acidity compared to typical food grade acidulants (such as citric acid etc.); therefore, the edible acidic monobasic mineral salt of polyprotonic acids does not “shock” the proteins in the milk by producing localized high acid areas as shown in common food grade acids, such as citric acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, phosphoric acid, lactic acid, and the like. The powdered composition is prepared by dry mixing all of the powders in the formula into a homogenous mixture. The powdered composition, when added to a pasteurized milk product (e.g., whole milk, 2% milk, 1% milk, skim milk, and the like prepared using any pasteurization method or to powdered milk reconstituted with water), will only require minimal mixing to obtain the desired acidified milk beverage. Preferably, the milk is pasteurized using the high temperature short time process; although, the powdered composition of the present invention can be used for all types of milk. For purposes of this invention, “minimal mixing” is intended to mean hand mixing using a simple hand mixing device such as a spoon. Blenders and mechanical mixing devices (e.g., rotator mixers operated by hand or electrical power, shaker devices, and the like) are specifically not required or included in the definition of minimal mixing. Of course, as one skilled in the art will understand, the requirement that only “minimal mixing” is required to obtain the desired acidified milk beverage does not mean that the consumer cannot use more vigorous mixing conditions, but only that such more vigorous mixing conditions or equipment are not needed (or desired). Preferably, a homogenous liquid beverage is obtained by hand mixing with a spoon for about 90 seconds or less, and more preferably for about 45 seconds or less. Indeed, one of the major advantages of the present powdered compositions is that only minimal mixing is required. Of course, optional ingredients can be included in the powdered compositions of this invention so long as they do not adversely affect the ability of the acidified milk beverage to be prepared by addition of the powdered compositions to pasteurized liquid milk or otherwise impair the organoleptic properties. Thus, for example, emulsifiers, flavorings, colorants, calcium fortification agents, vitamins, minerals, probiotics, prebiotics, fiber, and the like can be incorporated into the present powdered compositions. Suitable calcium fortification agents include, but are not limited to, calcium lactate, tricalcium phosphate, and the like. Although the present invention is mainly directed to powdered compositions which are to be added to a milk product, it can also be used to prepare a similar powdered composition containing milk powders (e.g., agglomerated skim milk powder, full fat or reduced fat milk powder, and the like) which can then be reconstituted in water to form a similar acidified milk beverage. In such a case, the milk powders may be added to the dry homogenous mixture or the milk powder can be added to the water first and then followed by the addition of the dry homogenous mixture. Although this invention is mainly directed to preparation of instant acidified milk beverages, the technology can be used to prepare other types of instant food products which can be quickly and easily prepared by the consumer at a desired time by either mixing into a milk product or water as appropriate. Such products include, but are not limited to, salad dressings, sauces, soups, and the like. Of course, flavorings can be incorporated into the powdered compositions to achieve the desired product flavor profile. The Examples that follow are intended to illustrate, and not to limit, the invention. All percentages and ratios used herein are by weight, unless otherwise indicated.
