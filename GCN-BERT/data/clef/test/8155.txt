SUMMARY In a first aspect of the disclosure, a multilayer composite material is described, the multilayer composite material comprising: an insulating substrate having a first surface and a second surface; at least one via defined in the insulating substrate, wherein the at least one via comprises at least one layer of a first metal; and at least one layer of a second metal different from the first metal, and wherein the at least one via forms a continuous path from the first surface to the second surface. DETAILED DESCRIPTION High Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (HTCC) is a popular material choice for hermetic packaging due to its desirable electrical properties, high mechanical strength and good thermal conductivity. Hermetic packages are airtight, or otherwise impervious to air or other gases. The use of platinum as an HTCC via material makes process control difficult due to the catalytic nature of platinum, particularly in reducing firing atmospheres. Platinum reactivity may result in varying degrees of degradation in an HTCC via. This can lead to problems with hermeticity and electrical resistance through the vias. Loss of hermeticity in post processing (e.g. brazing in a reducing atmosphere) is also a danger. The present disclosure describes a multilayer composite material via that unlike traditional multilayer vias is constructed using more than one metal paste system to fill the via layers. Using more than one metal allows the use of different or complementary properties possessed by different metals. For example, tungsten is a metal with desirable properties as it is robust and not as reactive as platinum. A composite via structure can take advantage of the robustness of the tungsten system. The process for firing the tungsten system is very robust and insensitive to variation normally occurring during said processing. On the other hand, the catalytic properties of platinum make the platinum material very sensitive to process variation particularly in the area of hermetic sealing. Tungsten can work very well in terms of hermeticity. The tungsten via is also hermetically stable through extreme post processing conditions (e.g. vacuum braze). The platinum via is not as stable. However, the platinum via can be much more biocompatible and electrochemically stable, resisting corrosion, which makes it suitable for contact with body fluids. The tungsten via readily corrodes in operation when in direct contact with body fluids. Therefore, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, a composite material construction of the HTCC via takes advantage of the benefits of platinum and tungsten while avoiding their disadvantages. The side of the substrate that will face the outside of a hermetic package enclosure towards the body environment would be platinum-filled via layer. The remainder of the via layers towards the hermetic package enclosure side of the substrate would be tungsten-filled via layers. The invention may incorporate other metals. Platinum may be replaced with other noble and biocompatible metals such as palladium, iridium, titanium, etc. Tungsten may be replaced with molybdenum or a tungsten-molybdenum mixture. In such a way, the tungsten side makes use of the durability of tungsten, while platinum is used for its stability in a biological environment, such as for example, biological implants in human bodies. The vias described in the present disclosure may be fabricated in a variety of ways, for example through providing a first ceramic sheet; forming holes in the sheet; inserting a conductive thick film paste in the hole; laminating the first ceramic sheet and forming a ceramic substrate with a second and third ceramic sheets attached to the upper and lower surfaces of the first ceramic sheet; firing the laminated ceramic substrate to sinter it and cause the metallic paste to form a metallic via, thereby forming a hermetic seal around the metalized via; and finally removing the second and third ceramic sheets in order to expose the metalized via. This method is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 8,555,271, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. For example, as visible in FIG. 1, a traditional via (105) in a ceramic body (106) may be made of tungsten and comprise three layers (107, 110, 115). A via according to one embodiment of the present disclosure, as illustrated in FIG. 2, may comprise a layer of platinum (205), and two layers of tungsten (210). According to another example, a traditional via may be made, as visible in FIG. 3, by three layers of tungsten (310) and interlayer circuitry also made of tungsten (305). A via according to one embodiment of the present disclosure, as illustrated in FIG. 4, may comprise a layer of platinum (410), and two layers of tungsten (405), with interlayer circuitry also made of tungsten (415). According to one embodiment of the disclosure, as illustrated in FIG. 5, a hermetic package may comprise a metal container (505) and a substrate (510) through which the vias can be defined. The via may comprise one layer of platinum (515) and two layers of tungsten (520). In such a package the substrate (510) may be brazed to the metal container (505). Titanium nickel braze is suitable for such a purpose. The substrate may be only 0.5 mm in thickness or thinner and remain hermetic. The feedthroughs may have a center to center pitch of 0.7 mm or less. FIG. 6 shows an alternate embodiment where the ceramic substrate (606) includes a via (605) of a first metal, tungsten for example, and a cap layer (608) is applied to the body facing side of the ceramic substrate (606) of a second metal, for example platinum. In this embodiment the cap layer (608) must be sufficiently dense to seal the tungsten via. This can be accomplished by electroplating platinum, applying platinum by ion beam assisted deposition, or other methods that result in a dense platinum layer. The cap layer may also function as a metal trace for redirecting an electrical connection to the via. The hermetic package may be used in biological implants, for example retinal implants which aid vision. The vias of the present disclosure comprise at least two metals, so that the metal more compatible with biological environments is on one end of the via, in the biological environment, and the metal more compatible with fabrication, such as High Temperature Co-fired Ceramic and hermetic packages, is on the other end of the via.
