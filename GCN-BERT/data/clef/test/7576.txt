Test Each of the thermally curable solder-resistant inks of Examples 3 and 4 and Comparisons 1 and 2 was coated on a 1 oz/ft2 copper foil, and a thermally curable solder-resistant layer 15 micrometers in thickness was obtained. The copper foil and the thermally curable solder-resistant layer were baked in an oven under 160° C. for 1 hour and a cured thermally curable solder-resistant layer laminated on the copper foil was obtained.

The more times the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layer was folded, the better the folding endurance was. To evaluate the solder resistance, the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layer was preheated and soldered afloat at 300° C. for 30 seconds.

The water absorption rate was measured by the method of IPC-TM-650 2.6.2.1. To evaluate the warpage resistance, the copper foil and the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layer laminated on the copper foil were cropped into a 10 cm×10 cm sample and placed on a glass substrate. The cured thermally curable solder-resistant layer and the glass substrate were located at the opposite sides of the copper foil and the copper foil was attached to the glass substrate. The average of the distances between the four corners of the sample and the glass substrate was defined as the warpage value. The smaller the warpage value was, the better the warpage resistance was. The flame resistance was evaluated by UL94 VTM-0. If the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layer passed UL94 VTM-0, the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layer was regarded as having good flame resistance. To evaluate the acid endurance, the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layer was immersed in 10 vol. % sulfuric acid (H2SO4) for 30 minutes.

With reference to Table 1, the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layers made from the thermally curable solder-resistant inks of Examples 3, 4 and Comparison 1 could be respectively folded for 2345 times, 2330 times, and 2360 times, which were very close to each other, while the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layers made from the thermally curable solder-resistant ink of Comparison 2 could only be folded for 893 times. Accordingly, the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layers made from the thermally curable solder-resistant inks of Examples 3 and 4 had good folding endurance. With reference to Table 1, the volume resistance, surface resistance and breakdown voltage of the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layers made from the thermally curable solder-resistant inks of Examples 3 and 4 were higher than the volume resistance, surface resistance and breakdown voltage of those made from the thermally curable solder-resistant inks of Comparisons 1 and 2. Accordingly, the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layers made from the thermally curable solder-resistant inks of Examples 3 and 4 had a better electrical characteristic than those made from the thermally curable solder-resistant inks of Comparisons 1 and 2. With reference to Table 1, the thermal decomposition temperature (Td) and glass transition temperature (Tg) of the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layers made from the thermally curable solder-resistant inks of Examples 3 and 4 were higher than the thermal decomposition temperature (Td) and glass transition temperature (Tg) of those made from the thermally curable solder-resistant inks of Comparisons 1 and 2. In addition, the coefficient of thermal expansion (C.T.E.) of the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layers made from the thermally curable solder-resistant inks of Examples 3 and 4 were smaller than the coefficient of thermal expansion (C.T.E.) of that made from the thermally curable solder-resistant ink of Comparisons 1 and 2. As a whole, the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layers made from the thermally curable solder-resistant inks of Examples 3 and 4 had a better thermal stability than those made from the thermally curable solder-resistant inks of Comparisons 1 and 2.

Thus, the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layers made from the thermally curable solder-resistant inks of Examples 3 and 4 had a better warpage resistance than the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layer made from the thermally curable solder-resistant ink of Comparison 2. Accordingly, compared with the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layer made from the thermally curable solder-resistant ink of Comparison 2, the cured thermally curable solder-resistant layers made from the thermally curable solder-resistant inks of Examples 3 and 4 had less shrinkage, sustained a specific shape, and had better deformability.
