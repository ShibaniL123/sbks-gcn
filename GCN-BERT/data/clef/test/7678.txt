FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to the development and use of heat resistant clear polycarbonate-polysiloxane compositions and uses thereof. BACKGROUND Polycarbonates are synthetic thermoplastic resins that may be derived from bisphenols and phosgene, or their derivatives. The desired properties of polycarbonates include clarity or transparency, high impact strength and toughness, heat resistance, weather and ozone resistance, and good ductility. They are useful for forming a wide variety of products, such as by molding, extrusion, and thermoforming processes. Such products include articles and components that include auto parts, electronic appliances and cell phone components. Because of their broad use, particularly in electronic applications or visually oriented applications, such as light covers, see-through protective coverings, lenses, and transparent films, it is desirable to provide polycarbonates with excellent weatherability, heat resistance, impact strength, and transparency. Prior means of improving impact performance of polycarbonates have often resulted in articles of manufacture that have a significant loss of heat resistance and/or transparency. Polysiloxane polycarbonates have provided improved impact strength performance and improved solvent resistance with substantial retention of transparency compared to PC homopolymers. However, polysiloxane polycarbonates exhibit lower heat resistance compared to other polycarbonates and thus their utility is limited in some commercial applications. There is a need for producing blends of high transparent and heat resistant polymers without substantially compromising the desired transparency and impact strength properties.

DEFINITIONS The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting. As used in the specification and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “and” and “the” include plural references unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. “Alkyl” as used herein may mean a linear, branched, or cyclic group, such as a methyl group, ethyl group, n-propyl group, isopropyl group, n-butyl group, isobutyl group, tert-butyl group, n-pentyl group, isopentyl group, n-hexyl group, isohexyl group, cyclopentyl group, cyclohexyl group, and the like. “Copolymer” as used herein may mean a polymer derived from two or more structural unit or monomeric species, as opposed to a homopolymer, which is derived from only one structural unit or monomer. “C3-C6 cycloalkyl” as used herein may mean cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. “Glass Transition Temperature” or “Tg” as used herein may mean the maximum temperature that a polycarbonate will have one or more useful properties. These properties include impact resistance, stiffness, strength, and shape retention. The Tg of a polycarbonate therefore may be an indicator of its useful upper temperature limit, particularly in plastics applications. The Tg may be measured using a differential scanning calorimetry method and expressed in degrees Celsius. The glass transition temperature of a polycarbonate may depend primarily on the composition of the polycarbonate. Polycarbonates that are formed from monomers having more rigid and less flexible chemical structures than Bisphenol-A generally have higher glass transition temperatures than Bisphenol-A, while polycarbonate that are formed from monomers having less rigid and more flexible chemical structures than Bisphenol-A, for example, generally have lower glass transition temperatures than Bisphenol-A. For example, a polycarbonate described herein formed from 33 mole % of a rigid monomer, 3,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-phenylisoindolin-1-one (“PPPBP”), and 67 mole % Bisphenol-A has a glass transition temperature of 198° C., while a polycarbonate described herein formed from Bisphenol-A, but also having 6 wt % of siloxane units, a flexible monomer, has a glass transition temperature of 145° C. Mixing of two or more polycarbonates having different glass transition temperatures may result in a glass transition temperature value for the mixture that is intermediate between the glass transition temperatures of the polycarbonates that are mixed. The glass transition temperature of a polycarbonate may also be an indicator of the molding or extrusion temperatures required to form polycarbonate parts. The higher the glass transition temperature of the polycarbonate the higher the molding or extrusion temperatures that are needed to form polycarbonate parts. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) described herein are measures of heat resistance of the corresponding polycarbonate and polycarbonate blends. The Tg can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry. The calorimetry method may use a TA Instruments Q1000 instrument, for example, with setting of 20° C./min ramp rate and 40° C. start temperature and 200° C. end temperature “Halo” as used herein may be a substituent to which the prefix is attached is substituted with one or more independently selected halogen radicals. For example, “C1-C6 haloalkyl” means a C1-C6 alkyl substituent wherein one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced with independently selected halogen radicals. Non-limiting examples of C1-C6 haloalkyl include chloromethyl, 1-bromoethyl, fluoromethyl, difluoromethyl, trifluoromethyl, and 1,1,1-trifluoroethyl. It should be recognized that if a substituent is substituted by more than one halogen radical, those halogen radicals may be identical or different (unless otherwise stated). “Halogen” or “halogen atom” as used herein may mean a fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom. “Haze” as used herein may mean that percentage of transmitted light, which in passing through a specimen deviates from the incident beam by forward scattering. Percent (%) haze may be measured according to ASTM D 1003-07. “Heteroaryl” as used herein may mean any aromatic heterocyclic ring which may comprise an optionally benzocondensed 5 or 6 membered heterocycle with from 1 to 3 heteroatoms selected among N, O or S.

The MVR of a molten polymer is measured by determining the amount of polymer that flows through a capillary of a specific temperature over a specified time using standard weights at a fixed temperature. MVR is expressed in cubic centimeter per 10 minutes. The higher the MVR value of a polymer at a specific temperature, the greater the flow of that polymer at that specific temperature. “Percent transmission” or “% transmission” as used herein may mean the ratio of transmitted light to incident light and may be measured according to ASTM D 1003-07. “PETS release agent” as used herein may mean pentaerythritol tetrastearate, mold release. “Phosphite stabilizer” as used herein may mean tris-(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphite. “Polycarbonate” as used herein may mean an oligomer or polymer comprising residues of one or more polymer structural units, or monomers, joined by carbonate linkages. “Straight or branched C1-C3 alkyl” or “straight or branced C1-C3 alkoxy” as used herein may mean methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy and isopropoxy. Unless otherwise indicated, each of the foregoing groups may be unsubstituted or substituted, provided that the substitution does not significantly adversely affect synthesis, stability, or use of the compound.

The polyester polycarbonate may be a combination of a polyester structural unit and a polycarbonate structural unit. The polyester structural unit may be derived from a C6-C20 aromatic dicarboxylic acid and one or more dihydroxy aromatic monomers. The polycarbonate structural unit may be derived from one or more dihydroxy aromatic monomers. The dihydroxy aromatic monomers of the polyester structural unit and the polycarbonate structural unit may be the same or different. Details of these structural units of the first polycarbonate are discussed below. (1) Homopolycarbonate/Copolycarbonate The first polycarbonate may be a homopolycarbonate or a copolycarbonate. The term “polycarbonate” and “polycarbonate resin” mean compositions having repeating structural carbonate units of the formula (1): in which at least about 60% of the total number of R1 groups are aromatic organic groups and the balance thereof are aliphatic, alicyclic, or aromatic groups. In one embodiment, each R1 is an aromatic organic group, for example a group of the formula (2): [in-line-formulae]-A1-Y1-A2- (2)[/in-line-formulae] wherein each of A1 and A2 is a monocyclic divalent aryl group and Y1 is a bridging group having one or two atoms that separate A1 from A2. For example, one atom may separate A1 from A2, with illustrative examples of these groups including —O—, —S—, —S(O)—, —S(O)2—, —C(O)—, methylene, cyclohexyl-methylene, 2-[2.2.1]-bicycloheptylidene, ethylidene, isopropylidene, neopentylidene, cyclohexylidene, cyclopentadecylidene, cyclododecylidene, and adamantylidene. The bridging group Y1 may be a hydrocarbon group or a saturated hydrocarbon group such as methylene, cyclohexylidene, or isopropylidene. The polycarbonates may be produced from dihydroxy compounds having the formula HO—R1—OH, wherein R1 is defined as above for formula (1). The formula HO—R1—OH includes bisphenol compounds of formula (3): [in-line-formulae]HO-A1-Y1-A2-OH (3)[/in-line-formulae] wherein Y1, A1 and A2 are as described above. Included are bisphenol compounds of general formula (4): wherein Ra and Rb each represent a halogen atom or a monovalent hydrocarbon group and may be the same or different; p and q are each independently integers of 0 to 4; and Xa represents one of the groups of formula (5): wherein Rc and Rd each independently represent a hydrogen atom or a monovalent linear alkyl or cyclic alkylene group and Re is a divalent hydrocarbon group.

Suitable heteroatoms for use in the heteroatom-containing cyclic alkylene group include —O—, —S—, and —N(Z)—, where Z is a substituent group selected from hydrogen, C1-12 alkyl, C1-12 alkoxy, or C1-12 acyl. Where present, the cyclic alkylene group or heteroatom-containing cyclic alkylene group may have 3 to 20 atoms, and may be a single saturated or unsaturated ring, or fused polycyclic ring system wherein the fused rings are saturated, unsaturated, or aromatic. Other bisphenols containing substituted or unsubstituted cyclohexane units may be used, for example, bisphenol of formula (6): wherein each Rf is independently hydrogen, C1-12 alkyl, or halogen; and each Rg is independently hydrogen or C1-12 alkyl. The substituents may be aliphatic or aromatic, straight-chain, cyclic, bicyclic, branched, saturated, or unsaturated.

METHOD OF MAKING FIRST AND SECOND POLYCARBONATES Polycarbonates can be manufactured by processes such as interfacial polymerization and melt polymerization. High Tg copolycarbonates are generally manufactured using interfacial polymerization. Although the reaction conditions for interfacial polymerization can vary, an exemplary process generally involves dissolving or dispersing a dihydric phenol reactant in aqueous caustic soda or potash, adding the resulting mixture to a water-immiscible solvent medium, and contacting the reactants with a carbonate precursor in the presence of a catalyst such as, for example, a tertiary amine or a phase transfer catalyst, under controlled pH conditions, e.g., 8 to 10. The most commonly used water immiscible solvents include methylene chloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, chlorobenzene, toluene, and the like. Exemplary carbonate precursors include, for example, a carbonyl halide such as carbonyl bromide or carbonyl chloride, or a haloformate such as a bishaloformates of a dihydric phenol (e.g., the bischloroformates of bisphenol A, hydroquinone, or the like) or a glycol (e.g., the bishaloformate of ethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, polyethylene glycol, or the like). Combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing types of carbonate precursors can also be used. In an exemplary embodiment, an interfacial polymerization reaction to form carbonate linkages uses phosgene as a carbonate precursor, and is referred to as a phosgenation reaction. Among tertiary amines that can be used are aliphatic tertiary amines such as triethylamine, tributylamine, cycloaliphatic amines such as N,N-diethyl-cyclohexylamine and aromatic tertiary amines such as N,N-dimethylaniline. Among the phase transfer catalysts that can be used are catalysts of the formula (R3)4Q+X, wherein each R3 is the same or different, and is a C1-10 alkyl group; Q is a nitrogen or phosphorus atom; and X is a halogen atom or a C1-8 alkoxy group or C6-18 aryloxy group. Exemplary phase transfer catalysts include, for example, [CH3(CH2)3]4NX, [CH3(CH2)3]4PX, [CH3(CH2)5]4NX, [CH3(CH2)6]4NX, [CH3(CH2)4]4NX, CH3[CH3(CH2)3]3NX, and CH3[CH3(CH2)2]3NX, wherein X is Cl−, Br−, a C1-8 alkoxy group or a C6-18 aryloxy group. An effective amount of a phase transfer catalyst can be 0.1 to 10 wt % based on the weight of bisphenol in the phosgenation mixture. In another embodiment an effective amount of phase transfer catalyst can be 0.5 to 2 wt % based on the weight of bisphenol in the phosgenation mixture. The polycarbonate may be prepared by a melt polymerization process. Generally, in the melt polymerization process, polycarbonates are prepared by co-reacting, in a molten state, the dihydroxy reactant(s) (i.e. aliphatic diol and/or aliphatic diacid, and any additional dihydroxy compound) and a diaryl carbonate ester, such as diphenyl carbonate, or more specifically in an embodiment, an activated carbonate such as bis(methyl salicyl) carbonate, in the presence of a transesterification catalyst. The reaction may be carried out in typical polymerization equipment, such as one or more continuously stirred reactors (CSTR's), plug flow reactors, wire wetting fall polymerizers, free fall polymerizers, wiped film polymerizers, BANBURY® mixers, single or twin screw extruders, or combinations of the foregoing. Volatile monohydric phenol is removed from the molten reactants by distillation and the polymer is isolated as a molten residue. A specifically useful melt process for making polycarbonates uses a diaryl carbonate ester having electron-withdrawing substituents on the aryls. Examples of specifically useful diaryl carbonate esters with electron withdrawing substituents include bis(4-nitrophenyl)carbonate, bis(2-chlorophenyl)carbonate, bis(4-chlorophenyl)carbonate, bis(methyl salicyl)carbonate, bis(4-methylcarboxylphenyl)carbonate, bis(2-acetylphenyl)carboxylate, bis(4-acetylphenyl)carboxylate, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing. a. End Capping Agent All types of polycarbonate end groups are contemplated as being useful in the high and low Tg polycarbonates, provided that such end groups do not significantly adversely affect desired properties of the compositions. An end-capping agent (also referred to as a chain-stopper) can be used to limit molecular weight growth rate, and so control molecular weight of the first and/or second polycarbonate. Exemplary chain-stoppers include certain monophenolic compounds (i.e., phenyl compounds having a single free hydroxy group), monocarboxylic acid chlorides, and/or monochloroformates. Phenolic chain-stoppers are exemplified by phenol and C1-C22 alkyl-substituted phenols such as p-cumyl-phenol, resorcinol monobenzoate, and p- and tertiary-butyl phenol, cresol, and monoethers of diphenols, such as p-methoxyphenol. Alkyl-substituted phenols with branched chain alkyl substituents having 8 to 9 carbon atoms can be specifically mentioned. Endgroups can derive from the carbonyl source (i.e., the diaryl carbonate), from selection of monomer ratios, incomplete polymerization, chain scission, and the like, as well as any added end-capping groups, and can include derivatizable functional groups such as hydroxy groups, carboxylic acid groups, or the like. In an embodiment, the endgroup of a polycarbonate can comprise a structural unit derived from a diaryl carbonate, where the structural unit can be an endgroup. In a further embodiment, the endgroup is derived from an activated carbonate. Such endgroups can derive from the transesterification reaction of the alkyl ester of an appropriately substituted activated carbonate, with a hydroxy group at the end of a polycarbonate polymer chain, under conditions in which the hydroxy group reacts with the ester carbonyl from the activated carbonate, instead of with the carbonate carbonyl of the activated carbonate. In this way, structural units derived from ester containing compounds or substructures derived from the activated carbonate and present in the melt polymerization reaction can form ester endgroups. In an embodiment, the ester endgroup derived from a salicylic ester can be a residue of BMSC or other substituted or unsubstituted bis(alkyl salicyl) carbonate such as bis(ethyl salicyl) carbonate, bis(propyl salicyl) carbonate, bis(phenyl salicyl) carbonate, bis(benzyl salicyl) carbonate, or the like. In a specific embodiment, where BMSC is used as the activated carbonyl source, the endgroup is derived from and is a residue of BMSC, and is an ester endgroup derived from a salicylic acid ester, having the structure of formula (22): The reactants for the polymerization reaction using an activated aromatic carbonate can be charged into a reactor either in the solid form or in the molten form. Initial charging of reactants into a reactor and subsequent mixing of these materials under reactive conditions for polymerization may be conducted in an inert gas atmosphere such as a nitrogen atmosphere. The charging of one or more reactant may also be done at a later stage of the polymerization reaction. Mixing of the reaction mixture is accomplished by any methods known in the art, such as by stifling. Reactive conditions include time, temperature, pressure and other factors that affect polymerization of the reactants. Typically the activated aromatic carbonate is added at a mole ratio of 0.8 to 1.3, and more preferably 0.9 to 1.3, and all sub-ranges there between, relative to the total moles of monomer unit compounds. In a specific embodiment, the molar ratio of activated aromatic carbonate to monomer unit compounds is 1.013 to 1.29, specifically 1.015 to 1.028. In another specific embodiment, the activated aromatic carbonate is BMSC. b. Branching Groups Polycarbonates with branching groups are also contemplated as being useful, provided that such branching does not significantly adversely affect desired properties of the polycarbonate. Branched polycarbonate blocks can be prepared by adding a branching agent during polymerization. These branching agents include polyfunctional organic compounds containing at least three functional groups selected from hydroxyl, carboxyl, carboxylic anhydride, haloformyl, and mixtures of the foregoing functional groups. Specific examples include trimellitic acid, trimellitic anhydride, trimellitic trichloride, tris-p-hydroxy phenyl ethane, isatin-bis-phenol, tris-phenol TC (1,3,5-tris((p-hydroxyphenyl)isopropyl)benzene), tris-phenol PA (4(4(1,1-bis(p-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl)alpha, alpha-dimethyl benzyl)phenol), 4-chloroformyl phthalic anhydride, trimesic acid, and benzophenone tetracarboxylic acid. The branching agents can be added at a level of about 0.05 to about 2.0 wt %. Mixtures comprising linear polycarbonates and branched polycarbonates can be used. 4. OTHER ADDITIVES a. Impact Modifiers The polycarbonate blend composition may further comprise impact modifiers. For example, the composition can further include impact modifier(s), with the proviso that the additives are selected so as to not significantly adversely affect the desired properties of the composition. Suitable impact modifiers may be high molecular weight elastomeric materials derived from olefins, monovinyl aromatic monomers, acrylic and methacrylic acids and their ester derivatives, as well as conjugated dienes. The polycarbonate blend composition formed from conjugated dienes can be fully or partially hydrogenated.

One type of exemplary organic phosphate is an aromatic phosphate of the formula (GO)3P═O, wherein each G is independently an alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, alkylaryl, or arylalkyl group, provided that at least one G is an aromatic group. Two of the G groups can be joined together to provide a cyclic group, for example, diphenyl pentaerythritol diphosphate. Exemplary aromatic phosphates include, phenyl bis(dodecyl)phosphate, phenyl bis(neopentyl)phosphate, phenyl bis(3,5,5′-trimethylhexyl)phosphate, ethyl diphenyl phosphate, 2-ethylhexyl di(p-tolyl)phosphate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) p-tolyl phosphate, tritolyl phosphate, bis(2-ethylhexyl) phenyl phosphate, tri(nonylphenyl)phosphate, bis(dodecyl) p-tolyl phosphate, dibutyl phenyl phosphate, 2-chloroethyl diphenyl phosphate, p-tolyl bis(2,5,5′-trimethylhexyl)phosphate, 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate, or the like. A specific aromatic phosphate is one in which each G is aromatic, for example, triphenyl phosphate, tricresyl phosphate, isopropylated triphenyl phosphate, and the like. Di- or poly-functional aromatic phosphorus-containing compounds are also useful as additives, for example, compounds of the formulas below: wherein each G1 is independently a hydrocarbon having 1 to 30 carbon atoms; each G2 is independently a hydrocarbon or hydrocarbonoxy having 1 to 30 carbon atoms; each X is independently a bromine or chlorine; m is 0 to 4, and n is 1 to 30. Exemplary di- or polyfunctional aromatic phosphorus-containing compounds include resorcinol tetraphenyl diphosphate (RDP), the bis(diphenyl)phosphate of hydroquinone and the bis(diphenyl)phosphate of bisphenol-A, respectively, their oligomeric and polymeric counterparts, and the like.

R can also consist of two or more alkylene or alkylidene linkages connected by such groups as aromatic, amino, ether, carbonyl, sulfide, sulfoxide, sulfone, or the like. Ar and Ar′ in formula (26) are each independently mono- or polycarbocyclic aromatic groups such as phenylene, biphenylene, terphenylene, naphthylene, or the like. Y is an organic, inorganic, or organometallic radical, for example (1) halogen, e.g., chlorine, bromine, iodine, fluorine or (2) ether groups of the general formula OB, wherein B is a monovalent hydrocarbon group similar to X or (3) monovalent hydrocarbon groups of the type represented by R or (4) other substituents, e.g., nitro, cyano, and the like, said substituents being essentially inert provided that there is greater than or equal to one, specifically greater than or equal to two, halogen atoms per aryl nucleus. One or both of Ar and Ar′ may further have one or more hydroxyl substituents. When present, each X is independently a monovalent hydrocarbon group, for example an alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, decyl, or the like; an aryl groups such as phenyl, naphthyl, biphenyl, xylyl, tolyl, or the like; and aralkyl group such as benzyl, ethylphenyl, or the like; a cycloaliphatic group such as cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, or the like. The monovalent hydrocarbon group can itself contain inert substituents. Each d is independently 1 to a maximum equivalent to the number of replaceable hydrogens substituted on the aromatic rings comprising Ar or Ar′. Each e is independently 0 to a maximum equivalent to the number of replaceable hydrogens on R. Each a, b, and c is independently a whole number, including 0. When b is not 0, neither a nor c can be 0. Otherwise either a or c, but not both, can be 0. Where b is 0, the aromatic groups are joined by a direct carbon-carbon bond. The hydroxyl and Y substituents on the aromatic groups, Ar and Ar′ can be varied in the ortho, meta or para positions on the aromatic rings and the groups can be in any possible geometric relationship with respect to one another.

Heat stabilizers are generally used in amounts of 0.0001 to 1 part by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the polymer component of the thermoplastic composition. 5. MIXERS AND EXTRUDERS The polycarbonate blend composition can be manufactured by various methods. For example, the first and second polycarbonates may be first blended in a high speed HENSCHEL-Mixer®. Other low shear processes, including but not limited to hand mixing, can also accomplish this blending. The blend may then be fed into the throat of a single or twin-screw extruder via a hopper. Alternatively, at least one of the components can be incorporated into the composition by feeding directly into the extruder at the throat and/or downstream through a sidestuffer. Additives can also be compounded into a masterbatch with a desired polymeric resin and fed into the extruder. The extruder is generally operated at a temperature higher than that necessary to cause the composition to flow. The extrudate is immediately quenched in a water batch and pelletized. The pellets, so prepared, when cutting the extrudate can be one-fourth inch long or less as desired. Such pellets can be used for subsequent molding, shaping, or forming. 6.

A glass transition temperature test was conducted with each of the Formulations. Measurement of glass transition temperature (row 2) for each of the formulations indicated that the PC-polysiloxane resin/XHT resin blends (Formulations 1 and 2) do not significantly differ from the glass transition temperature of polycarbonate resins (Formulations 7 and 8). Similarly, a melt volume flow rate test (MVR) was conducted using ASTM D 1238-10 at 1.2 kg at 300° C. MVR data indicates that with the exception of Formulation 2 (75% PC-polysiloxane/25% XHT) and Formulation 7 (low melt flow polycarbonate PC-1), the PC-polysiloxane/XHT blends meet the targeted 8 to 12 standard. Formulation 2 was only slightly below the targeted 8 standard. Formulations 1 and 2 exhibited only slightly deteriorated optical performance vs standard PC-polysiloxane resin Formulations 3 and 4. The percent transparency decreased only slightly in Formulations 1 and 2 as compared to the levels of transparency to PC-polysiloxane alone (Formulations 3 and 4). Formulation 1 with 85% PC-polysiloxane showed an 82.4% transparency in comparisons to 85.5% transparency to Formulation 3 with the same percentage of PC-polysiloxane. The percent haze using ASTM D 1003-7 at 0.125 inches in part thickness also showed a similar numbers when comparing Formulation 1 with Formulation 3. The impact performance test using ASTM D 256-10 (Notched Izod Measurements) was conducted at four different temperatures for each of the Formulations (i.e., −10° C., −20° C., −30° C., and −40° C.). The Izod test at low temperatures was used to differentiate amongst the Formulations by comparing the temperatures at which the Formulations undergo a ductile/brittle transition. At −20° C., Formulation 1 (85% PC-polysiloxane/15% XHT) provided similar impact strength (J/M) ductility at −20° C. as Formulation 3 (85% PC-polysiloxane/15% PC-1).
