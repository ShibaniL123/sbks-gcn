FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel functionally selective ligands of dopamine D2 receptors, including agonists, antagonists, and inverse agonists. The invention further relates to the use of these compounds in research and for treating central nervous system disorders related to D2 receptors. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Classical notions of receptor pharmacology imply that when a ligand interacts with a receptor, only a unitary outcome is possible. According to these models of receptor pharmacology, a full or partial agonist can activate only a single signal transduction pathway while an antagonist can only block the actions of an agonist. The key theoretical construct underlying this model was the concept of intrinsic efficacy (Furchgott, Advances in Drug Research (Harper N and Simmonds A eds) Academic Press, New York., pp 21-55 (1966)). According to this conceptualization, a full agonist has maximum intrinsic efficacy and maximally stimulates all cellular responses induced by ligand binding. A partial agonist possesses a lower degree of intrinsic efficacy and partially activates all cellular responses induced by an agonist. Antagonists, according to this schema, are neutral entities which possess no intrinsic activity but are able to block the receptor and preclude activation by full or partial agonists (Furchgott, Advances in Drug Research (Harper N and Simmonds A eds) Academic Press, New York., pp 21-55 (1966)). An extension of this model has been that a single G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) interacts with a single G protein subtype (e.g., Gi, Gs, Gq, Go and so on) and that full and partial agonists activate only a single transduction pathway. For many decades, however, it has been clear that these simplistic notions of GPCR (also known as 7-transmembrane receptor or 7-TM) function cannot account for the myriad of actions induced by agonist or antagonist binding. This was first convincingly demonstrated for the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) and dopamine (DA) families of receptors where it has been demonstrated that: (1) agonists differentially activate distinct signal transduction pathways (Beaulieu et al., J. Neurosci. 27:881 (2007); Berg et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 54:94 (1998); Ghosh et al., J. Med. Chem. 39:549 (1996); Kilts et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 301:1179 (2002); Mottola et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 301:1166 (2002); Parrish et al., J. Neurochem. 95:1575 (2005); Roth and Chuang, Life Sci. 41:1051 (1987); Urban et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 320:1 (2007)); (2) antagonists can possess negative intrinsic activity (e.g., function as inverse agonists) or be silent and thereby block the actions of an inverse agonist (e.g., neutral antagonists) (Barker et al., J. Biol. Chem. 269:11687 (1994); Burstein et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 315:1278 (2005); Chidiac et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 45:490 (1994); Gilliland and Alper, Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch. Pharmacol. 361:498 (2000); Rauser et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 299:83 (2001)); (3) antagonists can also induce receptor down regulation (Peroutka and Snyder, Science 210:88 (1980)) and receptor internalization in vitro (Berry et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 50:306 (1996)) and in vivo (Gray and Roth, Brain Res. Bull. 56:441 (2001); Willins et al., Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 861:121 (1998); Willins et al., Neuroscience 91:599 (1999))—properties typically associated with agonists. The processes by which agonists and antagonists differentially modulate signaling pathways and receptor trafficking have been variously dubbed ‘functional selectivity’, ‘biased agonism’ or ‘agonist-directed trafficking’. Currently, the preferred term for the process by which ligands can differentially activate signaling pathways mediated via a single GPCR is functional selectivity (Urban et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 320:1 (2007)). Functional selectivity has been demonstrated for more than a dozen GPCRs (reviewed in (Urban et al., Neuropsychopharmacology 32:67 (2007)) and is, likely, a ubiquitous phenomenon. In particular, functional selectivity has been widely observed among DA receptor subtypes. It is desirable to identify novel, functionally selective ligands of dopamine D2 receptors to elucidate the key signal transduction pathways essential for antipsychotic efficacy and the undesired ones associated with side-effects. Such compounds would also be useful agents for treating central nervous system (CNS) disorders including schizophrenia and depression. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to novel, functionally selective ligands of dopamine D2 receptors. When evaluated in multiple D2 binding and functional assays, the compounds of the invention showed different activity profiles ranging from full agonists to antagonists to inverse agonists. In particular, the compounds of the invention are β-arrestin biased and, in certain embodiments, also are inverse agonists of Gi-regulated pathways. These pharmacologically active compounds exhibit fewer side effects and are useful in research to study D2 receptor function and its role in psychosis and for the treatment of CNS disorders.

and/or according to Feenstra et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 11:2345 (2001) (incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The compounds of this invention include all pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms thereof. Examples of such salts include those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic and organic acids and bases. Examples of suitable acid salts include, without limitation, acetate, adipate, alginate, aspartate, benzoate, butyrate, citrate, fumarate, glycolate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, lactate, maleate, malonate, methanesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oxalate, palmoate, pectinate, persulfate, hydroxynapthoate, pivalate, propionate, salicylate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate and undecanoate. Other acids, such as oxalic, while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, can be employed in the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining the compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts. Salts derived from appropriate bases include, without limitation, alkali metal (e.g., sodium, potassium), alkaline earth metal (e.g., magnesium and calcium), ammonium and N-(alkyl)4+ salts. Compounds of the formulae herein include those having quaternization of any basic nitrogen-containing group therein. The compounds of this invention include deuterium-substituted versions of the disclosed compounds, e.g., compounds comprising 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 or more deuterium atoms. The discussion herein is, for simplicity, provided without reference to stereoisomerism. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the compounds of the invention can contain one or more asymmetric centers and thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single optical isomers, individual diastereomers, and diastereomeric mixtures. All such isomeric forms of these compounds are expressly included in the present invention. Similarly, compounds of the invention containing a double bond can exist in the form of geometric isomers, which can be readily separated and recovered by conventional procedures. Such isomeric forms are included in the scope of this invention. Further, the compounds of the invention include prodrugs of the compounds that are converted to the active compound in vivo. For example, the compound can be modified to enhance cellular permeability (e.g., by esterification of polar groups) and then converted by cellular enzymes to produce the active agent. Methods of masking charged or reactive moieties as a pro-drug are known by those skilled in the art (see, e.g., P. Korgsgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard, A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, Reading U.K., Harwood Academic Publishers, 1991). The term “prodrug” refers to compounds that are rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the above formula, for example, by hydrolysis in blood, see, e.g., T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Prodrugs as Novel delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series and in Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated by reference herein. See also U.S. Pat. No. 6,680,299. Exemplary prodrugs include a prodrug that is metabolized in vivo by a subject to an active drug having an activity of the compounds as described herein, wherein the prodrug is an ester of an alcohol or carboxylic acid group, if such a group is present in the compound; an amide of an amine group or carboxylic acid group, if such groups are present in the compound; a urethane of an amine group, if such a group is present in the compound; an acetal or ketal of an alcohol group, if such a group is present in the compound; a N-Mannich base or an imine of an amine group, if such a group is present in the compound; or a Schiff base, oxime, acetal, enol ester, oxazolidine, or thiazolidine of a carbonyl group, if such a group is present in the compound, such as described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,680,324 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,680,322. The term “pharmaceutically acceptable prodrug” (and like terms) as used herein refers to those prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and/or other animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like, commensurate with a reasonable risk/benefit ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention. Methods. The compounds in Tables 1 and 3 were designed and synthesized as novel, functionally selective ligands of dopamine D2 receptors to elucidate the key signal transduction pathways essential for antipsychotic efficacy and the undesired ones associated with side-effects. These novel compounds were evaluated in multiple D2 binding and functional assays: D2 radioligand binding, D2 cAMP GloSensor, D2 ERK phosphorylation (p-ERK), and/or D2 β-arrestin 2 translocation (Tango). In the D2 cAMP GloSensor assay, these compounds showed different activity profiles ranging from full agonists to antagonists to inverse agonists of the Gi-regulated cAMP pathway. In the D2 β-arrestin recruitment (Tango) assay, these compounds showed activity profiles ranging from little agonist activity to full agonist activity of the β-arrestin pathway. In the D2 ERK phosphorylation (p-ERK) assay, these compounds again showed different activity profiles ranging from antagonists to partial agonists that are more efficacious compared to aripiprazole with similar potency. Several β-arrestin biased, functionally selective D2 ligands were efficacious in D-amphetamine-induced and phencyclidine (PCP)-induced hyperlocomotion mouse models and did not induce catalepsy in wild-type mice at pharmacologically active doses. Interestingly, these compounds showed significantly attenuated antipsychotic-like activity and increased catalepsy in β-arrestin-2 knockout mice. These novel, pharmacologically active compounds are useful agents for studying dopamine receptor function and signaling pathways, as well as for treating CNS disorders. Furthermore, the compounds may have advantageous pharmacokinetic characteristics for treating CNS disorders, including a longer half life in brain and higher brain:plasma ratio over 24 h compared to other antipsychotic compounds. Additionally, the receptor binding pattern of the compounds (e.g., relative low potency at histamine receptors) suggests that the compounds may exhibit a lower risk for side effects, such as sedation and/or cognitive impairment. Thus, one aspect of the invention relates to a method of modulating the activity of a D2 dopamine receptor comprising contacting the receptor with a compound of the invention. The D2 dopamine receptor may be present in a cell, an isolated cell membrane or an artificial membrane. The cell may be a cultured cell, a cell isolated from a subject, or a cell in a subject (e.g., an animal model of disease or a patient). The receptor may be a wild-type or modified receptor and may be naturally-occurring or recombinantly expressed. The term “modulating” is intended to encompass any type of change in one or more activities of the receptor, including increasing or decreasing the activity of one or more receptor-linked signaling pathways. Many of the compounds of the invention display potent antipsychotic activity in animal models in vivo and are thus predicted to possess antipsychotic actions in humans and other animals. The compounds would thus be effective for treating diseases including, but not limited to, a variety of psychiatric disorders including: schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder, bipolar disorder, mania, manic psychosis, Tourette's syndrome and Tourette-like disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression with psychotic features, psychosis not otherwise specified (Psychosis NOS) and additional affective and non-affective psychiatric disorders. Additionally, the compounds would be effective against a number of neurological disorders including Huntington's Disease, Parkinsonian Psychosis, Alzheimer's Disease and associated psychosis and various organic brain syndromes. Further, the compounds would be effective at a variety of autism spectrum and autistic disorders. Given the D2-receptor functional selectivity, the compounds would also be effective against pituitary diseases including pituitary adenomas and prolactinomas as well as endocrinological disorders including, but not limited to, galactorrhea. The compounds have significant and unexpected advantages over conventional antipsychotic drugs in that they are predicted to effectively treat psychotic disorders without appreciable extra-pyramidal side effects (EPS), having minimal propensity for elevating serum prolactin and with a potentially lower risk of inducing tardive dyskinesia. Given the low affinities for H1-histamine and partial agonism for 5-HT2C serotonin receptors the compounds are expected to differ from approved atypical antipsychotic drugs by virtue of a lower propensity to induce weight gain and associated metabolic adverse consequences (diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension and so on (Kroeze et al., Neuropsychopharmacology 28:519 (2003)). The compounds also lack agonist activity at 5-HT2B serotonin receptors and hERG potassium channels and are thus predicted to have a low incidence of cardiovascular side-effects including prolongation of the Q-T interval and drug-induced valvular heart disease (Roth, N Engl. J. Med. 356:6 (2007)). Given the affinities of certain compounds for 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors the compounds are expected to have potential cognition-enhancing and antidepressant actions (Abbas et al., Psychopharmacology (Berl) 205:119 (2009); Woolley et al., Neuropharmacology 41:210 (2001)). Thus, these compounds are likely to also be effective in treating bipolar depression, unipolar depression, and a variety of anxiety disorders as well as disorders such as Alzheimer's Disease, dementia, Niemann-Pick Disorder, and other late-life dementias. Thus, one aspect of the invention relates to a method of treating a central nervous system disorder associated with D2 dopamine receptors in a subject, comprising delivering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of the compound of the invention. In certain embodiments, the disorder associated with D2 dopamine receptors is a psychiatric, neurological, pituitary, or endocrine disorder. In one embodiment of the invention, one or more of the compounds of the invention is administered to the subject as needed to treat a disorder. The compound can be administered continuously or intermittently. In one embodiment, the compound is administered to the subject more than once a day or once every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 days. In another embodiment, the compound is administered to the subject no more than once a week, e.g., no more than once every two weeks, once a month, once every two months, once every three months, once every four months, once every five months, once every six months, or longer. In a further embodiment, the compound is administered using two or more different schedules, e.g., more frequently initially (for example to build up to a certain level, e.g., once a day or more) and then less frequently (e.g., once a week or less). In other embodiments, the compound can be administered by any discontinuous administration regimen. In one example, the compound can be administered not more than once every three days, every four days, every five days, every six days, every seven days, every eight days, every nine days, or every ten days, or longer. The administration can continue for one, two, three, or four weeks or one, two, or three months, or longer. Optionally, after a period of rest, the compound can be administered under the same or a different schedule. The period of rest can be one, two, three, or four weeks, or longer, according to the pharmacodynamic effects of the compound on the subject. The compound of the invention can be delivered to the subject by any suitable route, e.g., oral, rectal, buccal (e.g., sub-lingual), vaginal, parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, or intravenous), topical (i.e., both skin and mucosal surfaces, including airway surfaces) and transdermal administration. The compound is delivered to the subject at a dose that is effective to treat the disorder. The effective dosage will depend on many factors including the gender, age, weight, and general physical condition of the subject, the severity of the disorder, the particular compound or composition being administered, the duration of the treatment, the nature of any concurrent treatment, the carrier used, and like factors within the knowledge and expertise of those skilled in the art. As appropriate, a treatment effective amount in any individual case can be determined by one of ordinary skill in the art by reference to the pertinent texts and literature and/or by using routine experimentation (see, e.g., Remington, The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (21st ed. 2005)). In one embodiment, the compound is administered at a dose of about 0.001 to about 10 mg/kg body weight, e.g., about 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 mg/kg. In some instances, the dose can be even lower, e.g., as low as 0.0005 or 0.0001 mg/kg or lower. In some instances, the dose can be even higher, e.g., as high as 20, 50, 100, 500, or 1000 mg/kg or higher. The present invention encompasses every sub-range within the cited ranges and amounts. In one aspect of the invention, the compound of the invention is delivered to a subject concurrently with an additional therapeutic agent. The additional therapeutic agent can be delivered in the same composition as the compound or in a separate composition. The additional therapeutic agent can be delivered to the subject on a different schedule or by a different route as compared to the compound.

The present invention finds use in research as well as veterinary and medical applications. Suitable subjects are generally mammalian subjects. The term “mammal” as used herein includes, but is not limited to, humans, non-human primates, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, cats, dog, rabbits, rodents (e.g., rats or mice), etc. Human subjects include neonates, infants, juveniles, adults and geriatric subjects. In particular embodiments, the subject is a human subject that has a CNS disorder associated with D2 dopamine receptors. In other embodiments, the subject used in the methods of the invention is an animal model of a CNS disorder associated with D2 dopamine receptors. The subject can be a subject “in need of” the methods of the present invention, e.g., in need of the therapeutic effects of the inventive methods. For example, the subject can be a subject that is experiencing a CNS disorder associated with D2 dopamine receptors and/or is anticipated to experience a CNS disorder associated with D2 dopamine receptors, and the methods and compositions of the invention are used for therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment. The compounds of the invention described above can be formulated for administration in a pharmaceutical carrier in accordance with known techniques. See, e.g., Remington, The Science And Practice of Pharmacy (21st ed. 2005). In the manufacture of a pharmaceutical formulation according to the invention, the compound is typically admixed with, inter alia, an acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense of being compatible with any other ingredients in the formulation and must not be deleterious to the patient. The carrier can be a solid or a liquid, or both, and can be formulated with the compound as a unit-dose formulation, for example, a tablet, which can contain from 0.01% or 0.5% to 95% or 99% by weight of the compound. One or more compounds can be incorporated in the formulations of the invention, which can be prepared by any of the well known techniques of pharmacy comprising admixing the components, optionally including one or more accessory ingredients. The formulations of the invention include those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, buccal (e.g., sub-lingual), vaginal, parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal, or intravenous), topical (i.e., both skin and mucosal surfaces, including airway surfaces) and transdermal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the condition being treated and on the nature of the particular active compound which is being used. Formulations suitable for oral administration can be presented in discrete units, such as capsules, cachets, lozenges, or tablets, each containing a predetermined amount of the active compound; as a powder or granules; as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. Such formulations can be prepared by any suitable method of pharmacy which includes the step of bringing into association the compound and a suitable carrier (which can contain one or more accessory ingredients as noted above). In general, the formulations of the invention are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the compound with a liquid or finely divided solid carrier, or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the resulting mixture. For example, a tablet can be prepared by compressing or molding a powder or granules containing the compound, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Compressed tablets can be prepared by compressing, in a suitable machine, the compound in a free-flowing form, such as a powder or granules optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, and/or surface active/dispersing agent(s). Molded tablets can be made by molding, in a suitable machine, the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid binder. Formulations suitable for buccal (sub-lingual) administration include lozenges comprising the compound in a flavored base, usually sucrose and acacia or tragacanth; and pastilles comprising the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerin or sucrose and acacia. Formulations of the present invention suitable for parenteral administration comprise sterile aqueous and non-aqueous injection solutions of the compound, which preparations are preferably isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations can contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. Aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions can include suspending agents and thickening agents. The formulations can be presented in unit/dose (e.g., in a syringe or other injection device) or multi-dose containers, for example sealed ampoules and vials, and can be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of the sterile liquid carrier, for example, saline or water-for-injection immediately prior to use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions can be prepared from sterile powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described. For example, in one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an injectable, stable, sterile composition comprising one or more compounds, in a unit dosage form in a sealed container. The compound is provided in the form of a lyophilizate which is capable of being reconstituted with a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carrier to form a liquid composition suitable for injection thereof into a subject. The unit dosage form typically comprises from about 0.001 mg to about 10 grams of the compound. When the compound is substantially water-insoluble (e.g., when conjugated to a lipid), a sufficient amount of emulsifying agent which is physiologically acceptable can be employed in sufficient quantity to emulsify the compound in an aqueous carrier. One such useful emulsifying agent is phosphatidyl choline. Formulations suitable for rectal administration are preferably presented as unit dose suppositories. These can be prepared by admixing the compound with one or more conventional solid carriers, for example, cocoa butter, and then shaping the resulting mixture. Formulations suitable for topical application to the skin preferably take the form of an ointment, cream, lotion, paste, gel, spray, aerosol, or oil. Carriers which can be used include petroleum jelly, lanoline, polyethylene glycols, alcohols, transdermal enhancers, and combinations of two or more thereof. Formulations suitable for transdermal administration can be presented as discrete patches adapted to remain in intimate contact with the epidermis of the recipient for a prolonged period of time. Formulations suitable for transdermal administration can also be delivered by iontophoresis (see, for example, Pharm. Res. 3:318 (1986)) and typically take the form of an optionally buffered aqueous solution of the compound. Suitable formulations comprise citrate or bis\tris buffer (pH 6) or ethanol/water and contain from 0.1 to 0.2 M active ingredient. Other pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared from the compounds disclosed herein, such as aqueous base emulsions. In such an instance, the composition will contain a sufficient amount of pharmaceutically acceptable emulsifying agent to emulsify the desired amount of the compound. Particularly useful emulsifying agents include phosphatidyl cholines and lecithin. In addition to compound, the pharmaceutical compositions can contain other additives, such as pH-adjusting additives. In particular, useful pH-adjusting agents include acids, such as hydrochloric acid, bases or buffers, such as sodium lactate, sodium acetate, sodium phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium borate, or sodium gluconate. Further, the compositions can contain microbial preservatives. Useful microbial preservatives include methylparaben, propylparaben, and benzyl alcohol. The microbial preservative is typically employed when the formulation is placed in a vial designed for multidose use. Other additives that are well known in the art include, e.g., detackifiers, anti-foaming agents, antioxidants (e.g., ascorbyl palmitate, butyl hydroxy anisole (BHA), butyl hydroxy toluene (BHT) and tocopherols, e.g., α-tocopherol (vitamin E)), preservatives, chelating agents (e.g., EDTA and/or EGTA), viscomodulators, tonicifiers (e.g., a sugar such as sucrose, lactose, and/or mannitol), flavorants, colorants, odorants, opacifiers, suspending agents, binders, fillers, plasticizers, lubricants, and mixtures thereof. The amounts of such additives can be readily determined by one skilled in the art, according to the particular properties desired. The additive can also comprise a thickening agent. Suitable thickening agents can be those known and employed in the art, including, e.g., pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric materials and inorganic thickening agents. Exemplary thickening agents for use in the present pharmaceutical compositions include polyacrylate and polyacrylate co-polymer resins, for example poly-acrylic acid and poly-acrylic acid/methacrylic acid resins; celluloses and cellulose derivatives including: alkyl celluloses, e.g., methyl-, ethyl- and propyl-celluloses; hydroxyalkyl-celluloses, e.g., hydroxypropyl-celluloses and hydroxypropylalkyl-celluloses such as hydroxypropyl-methyl-celluloses; acylated celluloses, e.g., cellulose-acetates, cellulose-acetatephthallates, cellulose-acetatesuccinates and hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose phthallates; and salts thereof such as sodium-carboxymethyl-celluloses; polyvinylpyrrolidones, including for example poly-N-vinylpyrrolidones and vinylpyrrolidone co-polymers such as vinylpyrrolidone-vinylacetate co-polymers; polyvinyl resins, e.g., including polyvinylacetates and alcohols, as well as other polymeric materials including gum traganth, gum arabicum, alginates, e.g., alginic acid, and salts thereof, e.g., sodium alginates; and inorganic thickening agents such as atapulgite, bentonite and silicates including hydrophilic silicon dioxide products, e.g., alkylated (for example methylated) silica gels, in particular colloidal silicon dioxide products. Such thickening agents as described above can be included, e.g., to provide a sustained release effect. However, where oral administration is intended, the use of thickening agents as aforesaid will generally not be required and is generally less preferred. Use of thickening agents is, on the other hand, indicated, e.g., where topical application is foreseen. Further, the present invention provides liposomal formulations of the compounds disclosed herein. The technology for forming liposomal suspensions is well known in the art. When the compound is in the form of an aqueous-soluble material, using conventional liposome technology, the same can be incorporated into lipid vesicles. In such an instance, due to the water solubility of the compound, the compound will be substantially entrained within the hydrophilic center or core of the liposomes. The lipid layer employed can be of any conventional composition and can either contain cholesterol or can be cholesterol-free. When the compound of interest is water-insoluble, again employing conventional liposome formation technology, the compound can be substantially entrained within the hydrophobic lipid bilayer which forms the structure of the liposome. In either instance, the liposomes which are produced can be reduced in size, as through the use of standard sonication and homogenization techniques. The liposomal formulations containing the compound disclosed herein, can be lyophilized to produce a lyophilizate which can be reconstituted with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, such as water, to regenerate a liposomal suspension. The present invention is explained in greater detail in the following non-limiting Examples. EXAMPLE 1 Synthesis of Compounds The compounds shown in Table 5 were synthesized as described below.

Results are summarized in Table 6. CHO-D2 Membrane Preparation for GTP-Radioligand Binding Assays Cells stably expressing D2 receptors (CHO-D2) were plated in 15-cm dishes (in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and grown to 90% confluence. Then, cells were washed with PBS, pH 7.4, and harvested by scraping into PBS, pH 7.4. Harvested cells were centrifuged at 1,000×g for 10 min, then hypotonically lysed by resuspension in ice-cold 50 mM HEPES, 1% BSA, pH 7.4. Membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 21,000×g for 20 min. The supernatant was removed and the membrane pellets were assayed for D2 ligand-stimulated GTP-gamma-S binding or stored at −80° C. until used for radioligand binding assays. CHO-D2 Radioligand Binding Assay Membranes prepared as above were resuspended to 1 μg protein/μl (measured by Bradford assay using BSA as standard), and 50 μl were added to each well of a polypropylene 96-well plate containing (per well): 50 μl of buffer (20 mM HEPES, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 100 mM N-methyl-D-gluconate, pH 7.4), 50 μl of 1.5 nM [3H]N-methylspiperone (final concentration 0.3 nM) and reference or D2 test ligand at various concentrations ranging from 50 μM to 50 μM (final concentrations ranging from 10 μM to 10 μM, triplicate determinations for each concentration of D2 test ligand). After a 1.5-hr incubation in the dark at room temperature, the reactions were harvested onto 0.3% PEI-soaked Filtermax GF/A filters (Wallac) and washed three times with ice-cold 50 mM Tris, pH 7.4 using a Perkin-Elmer Filtermate 96-well harvester. The filters were subsequently dried, placed on a hot plate (100° C.), and Melitilex-A (Wallac) scintillant was applied. The filters were then removed from the hot plate and allowed to cool. The filters were counted on a Wallac TriLux microbeta counter (3 min per well). Residual [3H]N-methylspiperone binding to filtered membranes was plotted as a function of log [reference] or log [D2 test ligand] and the data were regressed using the one-site competition model built into Prism 4.0 (GraphPad software). D2 Mediated cAMP GloSensor Assay HEK293T cells co-expressing the cAMP biosensor GloSensor-22F (Promega) and hD2 receptors were seeded (10,000 cells/20 μl/well) into white, clear-bottom, tissue culture plates in HBSS, 10% FBS, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. After a one- to two-hour recovery, cells were treated with 10 μl of 3× test or reference drug prepared in HBSS, 10% FBS, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. After 30 minutes, cells were challenged with 10 μl of 1,200 nM (4×) isoproterenol in 8% (4×) GloSensor reagent. Luminescence per well per second was read on a Wallac TriLux microbeta plate counter. Data were normalized to the isoproterenol response (100%) and the maximal quinpirole-induced inhibition thereof (0%) and regressed using the sigmoidal dose-response function built into GraphPad Prism 4.0. Notably, HEK293T cells expressing the GloSensor-22F alone (no hD2) were assayed in parallel and displayed no inhibition of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP, either by quinpirole or by the test compounds, suggesting that the effect observed in hD2-expressing cells was due to compound acting via the recombinant receptor. D2 β-Arrestin Recruitment (Tango) Assay Recruitment of β-arrestin to agonist-stimulated D2 receptors was performed using a previously described “Tango”-type assay (Barnea et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 105:64 (2008)). Briefly, HTLA cells stably expressing β-arrestin-TEV protease and a tetracycline transactivator-driven luciferase were plated in 15-cm dishes in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected (via calcium phosphate) with 20 μg of a D2V2-TCS-tTA construct (Barnea et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 105:64 (2008)). The next day, cells were plated in white, clear-bottom, 384-well plates (Greiner, 10,000 cells/well, 50 μl/well) in DMEM containing 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The following day, the cells were challenged with 10 μl/well of reference agonist (6 μM) or D2 test ligand (6 μM)±reference agonist prepared in HBS, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 18% DMSO (final ligand concentrations were 1 μM, final DMSO concentration was 3%). After 18 hours, the medium was removed and replaced with 1× BriteGlo reagent (Promega), and luminescence/well was read using a TriLux plate reader (1 sec/well). Data were normalized to vehicle (0%) and quinpirole (100%) controls and regressed using the sigmoidal dose-response function built into GraphPad Prism 4.0. pERK High-Content Assay Cell Culture: Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the hD2L dopamine receptor (Urban et al., Neuropsychopharmacology 32:67 (2007)) were maintained in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 μg/mL streptomycin, and 0.5 μg/ml G418. On day 1 of the assay, cells were seeded onto black clear-bottom tissue culture-treated 96-well plates (Greiner, BioOne). On day 2 of the assay, cells were washed with serum-free medium (Ham's F-12, penicillin and streptomycin) and incubated in 100 μL serum-free medium overnight. Immunofluorescence: Automatic multichannel pipetters were used for liquid handling and multichannel vacuum manifolds for aspirations. Each tested concentration was typically measured in triplicate or quadruplicate. For concentration curves, half-log-dilutions were used. Drug dilutions were prepared in stimulation medium (serum-free medium, 100 mg/L ascorbic acid). 100 μM dopamine and 1 μM PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate) were used as positive controls. Medium only was used as a negative control. Specificity of the response was confirmed by pretreatment for 5 min with 10 μM of the antagonist spiperone and in experiments using wild type CHO cells. Cells were stimulated on day 3 by fast addition of 50 μL equilibrated 3× drug dilutions in a tissue culture incubator for 5 min. Plates were placed on ice, the medium was aspirated, and 100 μL/well of freshly prepared ice-cold fixing buffer (4% formaldehyde and 0.5 mM CaCl2 in PBS) solution was added. After 30 min fixing at room temperature, the plates were washed with 350 μL/well PBS/Ca (0.5 mM CaCl2 in PBS) and permeabilized for 20 min in 100 μL/well 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS/Ca. Plates were incubated in 100 μL/well blocking buffer (PBS/Ca, 5% goat serum, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature and then in blocking buffer containing rabbit phospho-Thr202/p-Tyr204-ERK antibody (Cell Signaling 9101) at 1:1000 at 4° C. overnight. Cells were washed 3× for 5-10 min with 250 μL/well wash buffer (PBS/Ca, 0.03% Triton X-100). Plates were incubated with 50 μL/well Alexa-594 coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen) at 1:250, 5 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 nuclear stain, and 25 μg/mL concanavaline-Alexa488 conjugate (ConA, Invitrogen) in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. Plates were washed three times with 250 μL/well washing buffer, post-fixed for 10 min in fixing buffer, washed with 250 μl PBS/Ca, filled with 200 μL/well PBS/Ca, sealed with transparent adhesive plate seals, and stored at 4° C. Microscopy and Image Analysis: Plates were scanned with a high-content automated microscopic system (BD Pathway 855) using a 20× objective and a 2×2 image montage setting. The Alexa594 light path was used for the target signal, Alexa488 for whole cell staining, and Hoechst for the nuclear staining. Images were analyzed using the CellProfiler software. Well-averaged individual cell-based measurements were exported to Excel and cell-free background intensity was subtracted from the whole cell intensity. Concentration curves were analyzed in GraphPad Prism by fitting against a sigmoidal dose-response model and normalization to the dopamine curve. The results in Table 6 show that, of the 43 compounds tested, 33 are partial agonists (Emax of 10%-80%) of the β-arrestin pathway and another 8 compounds are full agonists (Emax>80%) of the β-arrestin pathway. The compounds are also exceedingly potent, with 39 having an EC50 less than 100 nM and 23 having an EC50 less than 10 nM. The cAMP (Glo-Sensor) assay shows that the majority of the tested compounds are not agonists for the Gi-coupled signaling pathway and that 14 of the 43 compounds function as inverse agonists for the Gi-coupled signaling pathway (i.e., have a negative Emax). The p-ERK assay confirms that the majority of compounds lack agonism via canonical G-protein-dependent pathways. Compounds 2 and 3 were tested for receptor binding specificity. Consistent with their high potency in D2 functional assays, 2 and 3 displayed high affinities (Ki's<10 nM) in the D2 radioligand competition binding assay (Table 7). Although 2 and 3 also had high affinity for D3-dopamine receptor, they displayed low affinities for other dopamine receptors (i.e., D1, D4, and D5). At serotonin receptors, 2 and 3 had moderate to high binding affinity (Ki's: 0.6-250 nM) at 5HT2A, 5HT2B, 5HT2C, and 5HT1A, but were significantly less potent in functional assays (Ca2+ mobilization fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) or cAMP biosensor). 2 and 3 were antagonists at 5HT2A, 5HT2B, and 5HT2C and weak agonists (EC50's>1 μM) at 5HT1A. In addition, 2 and 3 had moderate affinities to H1-histamine receptor (Ki's<10 nM) but were less potent in H1 functional assays. In general, 2 and 3 display a similar G protein-coupled receptor selectivity profile as aripiprazole (Table 7).

Mice. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and Duke University. C57BL/6J and β-arrestin-2 knockout (Bohn et al., Science 286:2495 (1999)) mice were housed under standard conditions—12 hour light/dark cycle and food and water provided ad libitum. Adult, age-matched male and female C57BL/6J and β-arrestin-2 knockout drug naive mice were used for all behavioral testing. Locomotor activity. Mouse locomotor activity was assessed in photocell-based activity chambers under standardized environmental conditions, using an AccuScan activity monitor (AccuScan Instruments, Columbus, Ohio) with a 25.8×25.8 cm Plexiglas chamber and a beam spacing of 1.52 cm as described (Abbas et al., J. Neurosci. 29:7124 (2009)). Mice were injected (i.p.) with vehicle (0.9% saline/0.2% acetic acid), aripiprazole (0.10, 0.25, 0.50 or 2.0 mg/kg), or UNC9975 (0.25, 0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg) and placed into the open field. Thirty min later D-amphetamine (3 mg/kg) or phencyclidine (6.0 mg/kg) was administered and they were immediately returned to the open field for 80 min. Activity was monitored throughout this entire period. Horizontal activity was measured as the total distance traveled in centimeters. The means±SEMs of the locomotor responses of animals were analyzed using Graphpad Prism 5.0. To estimate the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (ED50), dose responses of total locomotor activity during the 90 minutes after D-amphetamine or phencyclidine administration were plotted and best-fit decay curves were determined using a nonlinear regression one-phase decay equation. Cumulative locomotor responses were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test using Graphpad Prism 5.0. Statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Catalepsy testing. In this testing paradigm, mice were initially injected (i.p.) with vehicle (0.9% saline/0.2% acetic acid), aripiprazole, UNC0006 (5 mg/kg), UNC9975 (5 mg/kg) or haloperidol (2 mg/kg) and returned to their home cage. The latency of movement was assessed 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after drug injection; the maximal latency to move in the mice was observed 60 min after drug treatments. Mice were placed upright on a screen placed at a 45 degree angle. The time required for the animal to move all four paws was scored in seconds (maximum of 5 minutes) and is reported as the latency to movement. An extended delay to voluntarily move on the inclined screen test is indicative of drug-induced catalepsy. The data are displayed as mean±SEM. Catalepsy data were analyzed for statistical significance using a one-way ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test using Graphpad Prism 5.0. Differences were considered significant at p<0.05. UNC9975 exhibited potent antipsychotic-like activity in mouse hyperlocomotion studies which is attenuated in β-arrestin-2 knockout mice. In FIG. 1A, locomotion responses in inbred C57BL/6 mice are shown as 5 minute binned intervals to different doses (i.p.) of UNC9975 or vehicle followed 30 min later by 3 mg/kg D-Amphetamine (AMPH, i.p.). In FIG. 1B, total distance traveled after D-Amphetamine administration (30-70 min time interval) is shown. C57BL/6 mice were given vehicle or different doses of UNC9975 or aripiprazole 30 min prior to AMPH treatment. n=8 animals/group. *, p<0.05 versus vehicle+3 mg/kg D-Amphetamine group. In FIGS. 1C and 1D, locomotor activities are shown as 5 min binned intervals of wild-type (WT) or β-arrestin-2 knockout (β-ARR2 KO) littermate mice given vehicle or different doses of UNC9975 followed 30 min later with 6 mg/kg phencyclidine (PCP, i.p.). FIG. 1E shows the total distance traveled by WT and β-ARR2 KO mice after PCP administration (30 to 70 min time interval), shown in FIGS. 1C and 1D—different doses of UNC9975 were given to mice 30 min before PCP treatment. n=14 WT and β-ARR2 KO pairs/group. *p<0.05, versus vehicle+6 mg/kg PCP group.

UNC9975 and UNC0006 induced catalepsy in β-arrestin-2 knockout mice but not in wild-type littermates. In FIGS. 2A and 2B, wild-type and β-Arrestin-2 knockout littermate mice were administered (i.p.) vehicle, 5.0 mg/kg UNC9975, 5.0 mg/kg UNC0006, 5.0 mg/kg aripiprazole, or 2.0 mg/kg haloperidol. Following 30 and 60 min after drug injection, catalepsy was assessed using the inclined screen test where latency to move was scored. n=8 littermate wild-type and knockout animal pairs/group. *p<0.05 versus vehicle controls. Through a combined medicinal chemistry and comprehensive in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profiling approach, novel D2 β-arrestin-biased agonists were designed, synthesized and characterized, and demonstrated to have unique atypical antipsychotic drug-like activities in vivo. These novel compounds represent the first functionally selective β-arrestin-biased dopamine D2 receptor ligands to exhibit antipsychotic activity in vivo. These findings show that based on the arrestin-bias of these compounds, β-arrestin may be an important contributor to both antipsychotic drug efficacy and antipsychotic side effects. The disclosed compounds were discovered as unique, β-arrestin-biased functionally selective D2 ligands. In addition to possessing high affinity for D2 receptors, both UNC0006 and UNC9975 are potent partial agonists which induce D2 receptors-mediated β-arrestin recruitment and signaling, and simultaneously are potent inverse agonists at Gi-dependent signaling. More significantly, the in vivo atypical antipsychotic drug-like activity of UNC9975 indicated a strict requirement for β-arrestin-2 for both full antipsychotic activity and protection against motoric side-effects. Similar to aripiprazole, this β-arrestin-biased ligand shows a potent ability to suppress both D-amphetamine and phencyclidine-induced hyperlocomotion in mice, indicating that the compound possesses antipsychotic drug-like activities in vivo. Significantly, the antipsychotic drug-like activity of UNC9975 was attenuated in β-arrestin-2 knockout mice, indicating β-arrestin-2 is required in vivo for full activity. With the exception of aripiprazole, all FDA approved typical and atypical antipsychotic medications (e.g., haloperidol, chlorpromazine, clozapine, risperidone) share the common property of antagonizing D2-mediated G protein-dependent and independent signaling (Masri et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 105:13656 (2008)). Indeed, typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs, with the exception of aripiprazole, are inverse agonists at Gi-mediated signaling and antagonists at arrestin-ergic pathways. This combination of inverse agonism and antagonism is thought to underlie both the therapeutic benefit to prevent psychotic symptoms but can also cause serious extrapyramidal side-effects including catalepsy and other motor diskenesias (Roth et al., Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 3:353 (2004)). Although aripiprazole, UNC0006 and UNC9975 do not induce catalepsy in wild-type mice at doses at which antipsychotic drug-like therapeutic activities are measured, UNC0006 and UNC9975 resemble haloperidol in inducing catalepsy in β-arrestin-2 knockout mice. This propensity to cause catalepsy in the absence of β-arrestin-2 suggests that UNC0006 and UNC9975 signal through β-arrestin-2 in vivo and that this signaling may protect against motoric side-effects due to inverse agonism at D2 receptor Gi pathways. These findings have obvious implications for the development of novel therapeutic approaches for treating schizophrenia and related disorders. Atypical antipsychotic drugs, which differ from older medications (e.g., haloperidol and chlorpromazine) by virtue of their reduced propensity to induce motoric side-effects, are among the most widely prescribed medications. Many pharmacologic strategies which aim to target a multiplicity of non-D2 receptor molecular targets (e.g., 5-HT2A inverse agonists, 5-HT2C agonists, mGluR2/3 agonists, NK-3 antagonists, sigma antagonists, D1- or D4-selective antagonists and so forth) have led to a growing number of unsuccessful attempts to create safer and more effective atypical antipsychotic drugs (Roth et al., Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 3:353 (2004); Conn et al., Neuropsychopharmacology 33:2048 (2008); Gray et al., Mol. Psychiatry. 12:904 (2007)). The present results suggest that novel atypical antipsychotic drugs with a unique mechanism of action may arise from the disclosed β-arrestin-biased D2 ligands. These compounds may demonstrate special efficacies in psychotic disorders with a mood dysfunction given the prominent role of arrestin-ergic signaling in the action of lithium and related compounds.
