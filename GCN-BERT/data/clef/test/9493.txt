Background of the Invention This invention relates to an apparatus for rapidly and accurately changing speed of a flat article. This invention is not limited to its preferred use, changing speed of a disposable diaper or sheet of paper; but instead the apparatus of the present invention may be used in wide ranging applications. During manufacture of disposable diapers of the children's training pant type, or of the adult incontinence type, manufacturers typically process the diapers through a series of steps. For a variety of reasons, during the manufacturing process, it might be necessary to speed up or slow down the speed of the article, or to change the spacing between a series of articles. By slowing incoming articles down, the spacing between two adjacent articles can be reduced. Similarly, by speeding up subsequent articles, spacing between two articles can be increased. US 2005/233881 discloses an apparatus for reversing the direction of an article having first and second belts that rotate in different directions for moving the article in a first direction and then subsequently in a second direction. Summary of the Invention According to the present invention there is provided an apparatus for changing speed of a series of articles according to claim 1. The apparatus of present invention can be used to accelerate or decelerate articles, or to change the spacing between two adjacent articles. For instance, if two adjacent articles are provided closely together, the first article can be accelerated, and at a moment later, the second article can be accelerated. This lapse in time between acceleration of the first and second articles will cause the spacing between the two articles to increase. Likewise, if two adjacent articles are provided further apart, the first article can be decelerated, and at a moment later, the second article can also be decelerated. This lapse in time between deceleration of the first and second articles will cause the spacing between the two articles to decrease. These steps and advantages will be more evident with the following detailed description and drawings. Brief Description of the Drawings Figs. 1-10 show an apparatus for changing the speed of an article and for changing the spacing between two adjacent articles. Figs. 1-10 show an apparatus for changing the speed of an article (either speeding up or slowing down) and for changing the spacing between two adjacent articles (either increasing the distance between two adjacent articles or decreasing the distance between two adjacent articles).

Description of the Preferred Embodiment Although the disclosure hereof is detailed and exact to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, the physical embodiments herein disclosed merely exemplify the invention that may be embedied in other specific structure. While the preferred embodiment has been described, the details may be changed without departing from the invention. It is noted that the drawings, for clarity purposes so that the different elements can be seen, show the belts adjacent to but not contacting, the articles. This is merely for drawing clarity, it being understood that the belts move into contact with the articles when indicated by the text below, and out of contact with the articles when indicated by the text below. Figs. 1-10 show an apparatus for changing the speed of an article 20 (either speeding up or slowing down) and for changing the spacing between two adjacent articles (either increasing the distance between two adjacent articles or decreasing the distance between two adjacent articles). The apparatus of present invention can be used to accelerate cr decelerate articles 20, or to change the spacing between two adjacent articles 20. For instance, if two adjacent articles 20 are provided closely together (e.g., Fig. 1), the first article can be accelerated (e.g., Fig. 3), and at a moment later, the second article can be accelerated (e.g., Fig. 4). This lapse in time between acceleration of the first and second articles will cause the spacing between the two articles to increase. Likewise, if two adjacent articles are provided further apart, the first article can be decelerated, and at a moment later, the second article can also be decelerated. This lapse in time between deceleration of the first and second articles will cause the spacing between the two articles to decrease. Referring now to Fig. 1, an apparatus for changing the speed and spacing of adjacent articles, showing a first belt operating in a first direction at a first speed, a second belt operating in the first direction at a second, faster speed, and an article whose speed is desired to be increased is shown. The shaft 31 that drives the eccentric hubs 30 and 32 changes the effective centerline of these pulleys. In one embodiment, the eccentricity is such that rotating the shaft 31 180 degrees engages belt A disengages belt B. In another embodiment (not shown), shafts are arranged so as to shift only one of the two belts A or B, but each belt A and B having its own dedicated shaft system. This would allow for the opening of one nip and the closing of the other nip to be adjustable relative to the other. In this embodiment, the belt V driven by hub 32 travels at a first speed V, and the belt V' driven by hub 30 travels at a second, faster speed V'. Referring now to Fig. 2, a side view of the apparatus for changing the speed and spacing of adjacent articles 20, with the articles 20 whose speed and/or spacing between the following articles approaching the belts V and V' being engaged by the first belt V is shown. This belt V is preferably traveling substantially the same speed as conveyor 25 to ensure a smooth, relatively shear free transition off the conveyor 25 onto dead plate or guiding structure 50. Referring now to Fig. 3, a side view of the apparatus, with the first article 20 whose speed and/or spacing between the following articles being disengaged by the first belt V and the second belt V' approaching the article for engagement is shown. The second belt V' then engages the article 20 and speeds it to the faster V' speed, preferably traveling substantially the same speed as conveyor 126 to ensure a smooth, relatively shear free transition off of the dead plate or guiding structure 50 onto conveyor 126. Referring now to Fig. 4, a side view of the apparatus for changing the speed and spacing of adjacent articles 20, with the article 20 whose speed has been increased shown deposited unto conveyor 126, and the spacing increased between it and the following article 20, by engagement with the second belt V' is shown. The belts V and V' then cycle back to the position shown in Fig. 1, prepared for another incoming article 20 to be sped up and placed on conveyor 126. Referring now to Fig. 5, an apparatus for changing the speed and spacing of adjacent articles 20 is shown. In this embodiment, the articles are traveling at an initially faster speed V' and at a greater spacing than the articles of the embodiment shown in Figs. 1-4. If it is desired to slow the articles and/or reduce their spacing between subsequent articles, this embodiment can be employed. Referring to Fig. 6, the article 20 approaches the belt V' traveling substantially the same speed as conveyor 25, which is faster than conveyor 126 upon which the article 20 will exit. As shown in Fig. 7, the article is first engaged by belt V' at the faster speed and onto the dead plate 50, where belt V' disengages the article 20. Next, as shown in Fig. 8, the article 20 is engaged by the slower belt V and the article is then transferred onto the conveyor 126 at substantially the same speed as both belt V and conveyor 126. As is evident from Fig. 8, the articles 20 will then be spaced more closely together than they were upon entering the system, and also traveling slower, at the rate of conveyor 126, which in this embodiment is slower than the conveyor 25. Referring now to Fig. 9, an embodiment of an apparatus for changing the speed and spacing of adjacent articles is shown. In this embodiment, the articles can be operated upon without the assistance of the dead plate 50, and instead the articles can be sandwiched between two belts operating at the same speed. Referring now to Fig. 10, a side view of one embodiment of a conveyor and conveyor pulleys, and an eccentric cam to open and close the relationship, or oscillating up and down to engage an article is shown. Two rotating shafts 31 are provided, and each can be rotating in eccentric fashion to raise and lower hubs 30 and 32, in order to introduce the belts carried thereby (not shown) in the desire fashion, depending on the speeding or slowing, or reversing operations described above. The foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Furthermore, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described. While the preferred embodiment has been described, the details may be changed without departing from the invention.
