Example 5-2 : Preparation of 1-[2-(2-amino-pyridin-4-yl)-5-methoxy-pyrimidin-4-yl]-ethanone (XXXI)
[4-(4-chloro-5-methoxy-pyrimidin-2-yl)-pyridin-2-yl]-carbamic acid-tert-butyl ester (XXX) (200 mg, 1.13 mmol), palladium(II) acetate (Pd(OAc)2) (10.15 mg, 45.20 µmole), and 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane (DPPP) (37.29 mg, 90.41 µmole) were dissolved in 1.0 mL of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([bmim] [BF4]). To the resulting solution were slowly added dropwise butyl vinyl ether (731.23 µL, 5.65 mmole) and triethylamine (TEA) (252.03 µL, 1.81 mmole). The resulting mixture was stirred at 125 °C for 24 hrs and then cooled to room temperature. 2 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) was slowly added dropwise to the mixture to adjust pH to 1∼2 and the mixture was stirred for 30 min and neutralized. The resulting solution was diluted with dichloromethane and washed with water. The organic solvent was dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and then evaporated under reduced pressure to concentrate. The resulting residue was isolated and purified by silica gel column chromatography (n-Hex/EA = 3/1) to give the title compound (50 mg, 21 %).
