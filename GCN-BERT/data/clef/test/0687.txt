(, 646098 Thìs invention is concerned with protective arrangements for electric circuits supplying current to apparatus, especially to portable or other domestic current-consuming appliances. In particular the aim is to protect the apparatus and the user from any danger arising through incorrect connections being made, or through a fault developing in the leads to the apparatus or in the apparatus itself. A large proportion of portable domestic electrical appliances such as suction cleaners, hair dryers, lawn mowers, electric blankets, portable drills, are at the present day still only fitted with two-core cables, having live and neutral only, and there is no legal compulsion for the provision of an earth conductor. The consequent danger of the appliance becoming electrically llve is increased if in addition the leads are connected wrongly to the supply so that the slngle-pole switch is in the neutral instead of in the live conductor. Where three pin earthed supply sockets are provided there is still nothing to ensure that threecore cable is used to the appliance, and furthermore even where three-core cable is used there is no cor« talnty that it will be connected correctly. When it is appreciated that there are six different possible ways of connecting three wires to three terminals, only one of which is correct, it will be understood that it is very easy for an appliance to be wrongly connected te a plug by inexperienced hands. requently the appliance works satisfactorily and the danger is not realised until an accident results. ç Again, even with the appliance correctly wired to the plug, any interruption of the earth conductor will not be detected and the appliance will continue to be used in a potentially dangerous state. In industry the earth connection of portable appliances is often checked by discharging a heavy current through it from a test instrument from time to time, but no such check protects the domestic user of applìances. lO It is known to provide various kinds of safety device including differential transformers and relays, earth-leakage relays, and also transformers of which the secondary winding produces a low-voltage output which causes a current to circulate in the earth lead of the appliance to be protected. However, none of these devices so far proposed has ensured firstly tha$ the earth connection is continuous right back to &ts point of union with the neutral line of the mains supply, and secondly that the appliance cannot be connected, even momentarily, unless the connections are substantially correct. The aim of the invention is to overcome these drawbacks and to provide, as far as possible, an effective safeguard both against incorrect connection of the apparatus and against failure of the earth conductor, in addition to the usual fusible links in the supply protecting against overloads and shortcircuits. According to the invention, a safety devìce for disposal between a source of current supply and a current-consuming appliance comprises a detecting device such as a cold-cathode trigger tube or a transIster of which the main current path is connected in one arm of a bridge circuit of which one diagonal is disposed across leads designed to be connected across the supply, whilst the other diagonal carríes the coil of a relay which has contacts controlling the connection of the supply to the appliance, and the sensitive member of the detecting device (i.e. the trigger electrode in the case of a cold cathode tube, or the ç .... ì base in the case of a transistor) is connected to a point in a potential divider between that lead which is designed to be connected to the live side of the supply and a lead for connection to an earth loop on the appliance. Normally the device will be used to protect appliances running from an alternating current supply. In "that case, the bridge may be supplied through a rectifier, and the current through the earth loop may or may not be fed through a rectifier, depending on whether or not it is thought desirable to have alternating current flowing in the earth loop. The advantage of the bridge circuìt is that it fails to safety. The relay contacts are normally open, isolating the appliance from the supply, and they only close if the relay iS energised, which in its turn only occurs if the mains voltage is available between the correct leads, with the llve and neutral connected the right way round, and the earth lead of the mains is continuous right back to the star point of the supply transformer. Any rise in the potential of the trigger electrode above a predetermined value will fire the tube and its impedance will fall tO a value such as to balance the bridge and cause the relay to drop out. Likewise, in the absence of mains voltage between the correct pair of leads the relay will not pick up in the first place. ï An example of a safety device according to the inventìon will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:- Pierre I shows the circuit layout of one form of the device figure 2 shows a more refined version ëf the layout of figure l, incorporating addit onal safety features and also including provisions for testing the working of the device. i ii!! i iiiiiiii! L i••i ...... ï 646O98 Referring first to figure l, which shows the circuit of a device suitable for use with an alternating current supply, terminals N and E are desi ed to be connected respectively to the live, neutral and earth connections of the supply. At the output of the device there are terminals N', T,, and E' and E' for connection to a current-consumIng appliance which is to be protected. The two terminals E' and E' are for connection to two sept arate points in th frame or earth shield of the appliance. Per example, where the appliance includes an extended heating element, the element may be enclosed in a sheath throughout its length, and the two ends of this sheath are connected to the terminals E' and E' to complete an earth loop. ' 2 Between the live line (extending from T, to T.,) and the neutral llne (extending from N to N') of the device there is connected one diagonal of a bridge circuit B in series with a half-wave rectifier G. The other, diagonal of the bridge circuit is spanned by the coil of a relay A, which controls contacts in all three leads between the input and output of the device as well as in an internal connection to the terminal E' (E' being connected to E). Three ' 2 of the arm8 of the bridge are formed by resistors of fixed value and the fourth by the anode-cathode path of a cold-cathode trigger tube T, the cathode being at that side of the bridge which is connected to the neutral line. The trigger electrode of the tube T is connected to an intermediate point in a potential divider P of which the up2er end is connetted to the llve end of the bridge and the lower end to the line, mentioned earlier, leasing to the output earth terminal E'. The potential across the bridge is etabilised by a non-linear resistor M, and there is also a condenser 0 in parallel with the bridge to by-pass the alternating component of the current. In the output of the device, between the live and neutral lines, there is an indicator light S to show when the contacts of relay A are closed. ï :EL 64609 That contact of the relay A which is disposed between the lower end of the potential divider P and the terminal E', includes a back contact connecting the divider P to the earth terminal E when the relay is not energised. There is also a high resistance R between the lower end of the.potential dévider P and the neutraoE line. r When the device is correctly connected to the supply and to the appliance, and all is in order, the potential difference appearing between the live and neutral lines of the appliance causes a current to flow through the coil of relay A, as the trigger tube T is non-conducting and so the bridge is unbalanced. The contacts close and current is fed to the appliance. If the earth loop of the appliance is continuous, the relay A remains energlsed, but if it is broken the lower end of the divider P will no longer be held down to earth potential, and so the potential of the trigger electrode of the tube T will oEse until the tube fires and the values of the resistors forming the remaining arms of the bridge are such that the bridge now becomes balanced and the relay A drops out. Furthermore, if the earth llne of the supply had been at a potential above that of the neutral line exceeding a predetermined very small amount, or had been broken, the relay would never have been energised in the first place as the tube T would have fired immediately on connection 'of the device to the supply, balancing the bridge and preventing energisation of the relay. Thus, if any of the mains supply connections are faulty, the relay A will not close. Likewise it will not stay closed if the earth loop of the appliance is faulty. It will be noted that the contact in the lead E' is such that it closes before the remainder, so if there is a fault in the earth loop of the appliance the contacts in the leads to T., and : ;rill never have a chance to close. ï • • 6. k ¸ i Subsequently, the relay will drop away if any fault develops anywhere in the earth connection right back to the star point of the mains supply transformer where the neutral is earthed. The relay will of course also drop away on interruption of the live or neutral line. The resistor R prevents any high potential appearing on the earth wire in the event of breakage of that wire between the device and the supply. XO The modified device of which a circuit diagram is shown in Figure 2 is similar to that of Figure I and the same reference letters have been used for correspondis parts, but certain refinements are included. The point on the potential divider P to which the trigger electrode of the tube T le connected le made adjustable, and the potential drop across this divider is stabilised by a further non-linear resistor M'. The lead between the lower end of the potential divider ? and the terfinal E includes a test button D enabling the earth loop to be deliberately broken at will fo see that the device operates correctly. A re-set button F in a path parallel with the anodecathode path of the tube T enables one to short95 circuit the tube and de-ionize it to unbalance the bridge and close the relay A again after testing. The circuit also includes a red signal light S' to show when a fault occurs and an amber light S to show when current la available at the 0 G tput for %ho appliance. Further possible modifications include the stabilisation of the divider P by means of neon tubes in place of the resistor M', and the coYme -tion of the upper end of the divider fo the lire line instead of fo the Junction of the bridge and the rectifier. To detect leakages between the lire side and the earth loop in the appliance, the device may include a known form of earth leakage detection. For exemple, a differential transformer may have its two prlmarywindings in the lire and neutral lines of the device, adjacent to the terminals L0 and ;.a ' • :9 fO N', and its secondary winding in the earth loop, or in the lower part of the potential di«iaer P, or in %h : connection to tb.e trigger .... e » ....... í ,.,. : « of the t: be P.,.:. p'ta!n t.[-o.r, sforAe .... £ -,.; b: u «6., with its or-ì.'._,-,a -y " « -* z .... bhe : ,g iì e- :eth l: »_e of the device • ,n .% l ad3a .... t to the l.e:'n inal F.' an'/ its secondary winding at one of €he polnüs mentioned above for the secondary vt!n,Ji.nÇ of the dlf, ..... ,.% ..... ,+,!«ansformer. , dx.. . .
