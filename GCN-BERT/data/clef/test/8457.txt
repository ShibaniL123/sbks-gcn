FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film capable of efficiently absorbing near-field electromagnetic waves of several hundreds of MHz to several GHz in mobile information terminals such as cell phones and smartphones, and electronic appliances such as personal computers, etc., and its production method. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Recently, mobile communications terminals, electronic appliances, etc. having various functions and high performance have been getting required to be smaller and lighter, so that electronic parts are disposed in a narrower space at higher density, with their speeds increasing. Accordingly, among circuits and parts, electromagnetic wave noises, particularly high-frequency noises of several hundreds of MHz to several GHz have become serious problems. To suppress such near-field electromagnetic wave noises, various electromagnetic-wave-absorbing films have been proposed and put into practical use. Such electromagnetic-wave-absorbing films mostly contain magnetic materials and/or conductive materials. For example, JP 2010-153542 A discloses an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film comprising a substrate; a conductive layer formed by a conductive coating material containing particles, flakes or thin wires of metals such as Cu, etc. or carbon; and a magnetic layer formed by a magnetic coating material containing soft-magnetic materials such as ferrite, Sendust, permalloy, etc. However, the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film disclosed in JP 2010-153542 A is expensive because of having the conductive layer and the magnetic layer, and does not have sufficient absorbability to electromagnetic wave noises of several hundreds of MHz to several GHz. JP 2006-114877 A discloses an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing sheet obtained by applying an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing coating composition to at least one surface of a substrate sheet made of silicone resins, acrylic resins, polyimide resins, phenol resins, urethane resins, PET, etc.; the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing coating composition comprising (a) 100 parts by weight of a carbon nano-material such as carbon nanotube, carbon nanohom, graphite nanofibers, carbon nanofibers, etc., (b) 50-1000 parts by weight of a resin component such as thermoplastic resins such as ABS resins, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyamides, polyimides, polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonates, polyvinyl chloride, etc., thermosetting resins such as epoxy resins, phenol resins, etc., or UV-curing resins such as polyesters, polyvinyl butyral, acrylics, phenols, polyurethanes, etc., and (c) 50-3000 parts by weight of an organic solvent such as ketones, saturated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, glycol ethers, glycol etheresters, alcohols, etc. However, the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing sheet disclosed in JP 2006-114877 A does not have sufficient absorbability to electromagnetic wave noises of several hundreds of MHz to several GHz. OBJECT OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film having high absorbability to electromagnetic wave noises of several hundreds of MHz to several GHz, suitable for mobile information terminals, electronic appliances, etc., and its production method. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION As a result of intensive research in view of the above object, the inventor has noticed that though flaky fine graphene particles are better in electromagnetic wave absorbability than carbon black and carbon nanotube, flaky fine graphene particles are easily aggregated, and thus found that when a small amount of a diluted uniform dispersion of flaky fine graphene particles is applied plural times, and dried after each application, an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer having a necessary thickness can be formed while preventing the aggregation of flaky fine graphene particles. The present invention has been completed based on such finding. Thus, the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film of the present invention comprising a plastic film, and an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer formed on the plastic film, the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer comprising flaky fine graphene particles and a binder resin; the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer having a thickness of 2-15 g/m2 (expressed by the weight of fine graphene particles per 1 m2); a mass ratio of the binder resin to fine graphene particles in the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer being 0.05-1; and the total area ratio of regions free of fine graphene particles (fine-graphene-particles-free regions) in the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer being 5% or less. The fine graphene particles preferably have an average diameter of 5-100 μm and an average thickness of 5-50 nm. The binder resin is preferably an acrylic resin, a polystyrene resin or polyvinyl alcohol. The electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer is preferably laminated with a protective film. The method of the present invention for producing the above electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film comprises repeating plural times a cycle of applying a dispersion comprising 1-10% by mass of fine graphene particles and 0.05-5% by mass of a binder resin in an organic solvent to a plastic film, and then drying the dispersion. A mass ratio of the binder resin to the fine graphene particles in the dispersion is preferably 0.05-1. The amount of the dispersion applied at a time is preferably 1-3.5 g/m2 (expressed by the weight of fine graphene particles per 1 m2). The organic solvent is preferably at least one selected from the group consisting of ketones, aromatic hydrocarbons and alcohols. The drying is preferably conducted by heating at 30-100° C. The cycle of applying and drying the dispersion is preferably repeated 2-6 times.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail below referring to the attached drawings. Explanations of each embodiment are applicable to other embodiments, unless otherwise mentioned. The following explanations are not restrictive, and various modifications may be made within the scope of the present invention. [1] Electromagnetic-Wave-Absorbing Film As shown in FIG. 1, the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film of the present invention 1 comprises a plastic film 11, and an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 formed on a surface of the plastic film 11. (1) Plastic Film Resins forming the plastic film 11 are not particularly restrictive as long as they have sufficient strength, flexibility and workability in addition to insulation, and they may be, for instance, polyesters (polyethylene terephthalate, etc.), polyarylene sulfide (polyphenylene sulfide, etc.), polyether sulfone, polyetheretherketone, polycarbonates, acrylic resins, polyamides, polyimides, polystyrenes, polyolefins (polyethylene, polypropylene, etc.), etc. The thickness of the plastic film 10 may be about 10-50 μm. (2) Electromagnetic-Wave-Absorbing Layer The electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 is formed by fine graphene particles bonded by a binder resin. (a) Fine Graphene Particles As shown in FIG. 2, each flaky fine graphene particle 31 has a plate-like structure composed of two-dimensionally bonded benzene rings. Though it may be either monolayer or multi-layer, the multi-layer structure is more preferable from the aspect of conductivity. Because fine graphene particles 31 have a hexagonal lattice structure, each carbon atom is bonded to 3 carbon atoms, one of 4 peripheral electrons used for chemical bonding is in a free state (called “free electron”). Because free electrons are movable along the crystal lattice, fine graphene particles 31 have high conductivity. Because a fine graphene particle 31 is in a flaky shape, the diameter of the fine graphene particle 31 is expressed by a diameter of its planar surface. Because each fine graphene particle 31 has a planar surface having an irregular contour as shown in FIG. 3, the diameter of each fine graphene particle 31 is expressed by a diameter d of a circle having the same area S. Because the size of each fine graphene particle is expressed by its diameter d and thickness t, the average diameter of fine graphene particles used is expressed by (Σd)/n, wherein n represents the number of fine graphene particles, and the average thickness is expressed by (Σt)/n. The diameter d and thickness t of fine graphene particles are determined by image analysis of a photomicrograph of fine graphene particles. Fine graphene particles used in the present invention may have an average diameter in a range of 5-100 μm. When the average diameter of fine graphene particles is less than 5 μm, bonded carbon atoms do not have sufficient length, providing the resultant electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer with too large surface resistance. On the other hand, when the average diameter of fine graphene particles is more than 100 μm, the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer has too small surface resistance. The average diameter of fine graphene particles is preferably 5-50 μm, more preferably 10-30 μm. The average thickness of fine graphene particles may be in a range of 5-50 nm. When the average thickness of fine graphene particles is less than 5 nm, the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer has large surface resistance by a binder resin existing between fine graphene particles, making it necessary to use a large amount of fine graphene particles for lower surface resistance, with economic disadvantages. On the other hand, when the average thickness of fine graphene particles is more than 50 nm, fine graphene particles are easily broken when uniformly dispersed in a solvent. The average thickness of fine graphene particles is preferably 5-30 nm, more preferably 10-25 nm. (b) Binder Resin Binder resins used in the present invention are not particularly restricted, as long as they are soluble in an organic solvent, and can uniformly disperse fine graphene particles. They may be either thermoplastic resins or thermosetting resins (photo-curing resins). Thermoplastic resins usable in the present invention include acrylic resins such as polymethylacrylate and polymethylmethacrylate, polystyrenes, polycarbonates, polyvinyl chloride, ABS resins, etc. Preferable among them are polymethylmethacrylate and polystyrenes. Thermosetting resins usable in the present invention include epoxy resins, phenol resins, unsaturated polyester resins, alkyd resins, polyurethanes, etc. Photo-curing resins usable in the present invention include diacrylates, triacrylates, etc. Thermosetting resins and photo-curing resins are preferably dissolved in an organic solvent in the form of oligomers. (c) Composition Ratio With a smaller mass ratio of a binder resin to fine graphene particles, the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer exhibits higher electromagnetic wave absorbability. With too small a percentage of the binder resin, however, fine graphene particles are easily detached. Accordingly, to have both good electromagnetic wave absorbability and high adhesion of fine graphene particles, the binder resin/fine graphene particles mass ratio is preferably 1 or less, more preferably 0.5 or less. The lower limit of the binder resin/fine graphene particles mass ratio is preferably 0.05, more preferably 0.1, most preferably 0.3. (d) Uniform Distribution of Fine Graphene Particles Without a uniform distribution of fine graphene particles in the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer, (a) fine-graphene-particles-poor regions are formed by the aggregation of fine graphene particles, so that the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film does not have desired surface resistance, failing to exhibit sufficient electromagnetic wave absorbability, and (b) when the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film is divided for individual electronic appliances or parts, some divided pieces do not exhibit desired electromagnetic wave absorbability because of many fine-graphene-particles-poor regions. The distribution of fine graphene particles in the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer can be evaluated by (1) an area ratio of fine-graphene-particles-free regions determined from a photomicrograph of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer, (2) the surface roughness of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer, and (3) the light transmittance of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer. (1) Elevation Method by Area Ratio As shown in FIG. 4, an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 suffering the aggregation of fine graphene particles comprises fine-graphene-particles-aggregated regions 33 and fine-graphene-particles-free regions 34. This can be easily confirmed by an electron photomicrograph. With the fine-graphene-particles-aggregated regions 33 having an area S1, and the fine-graphene-particles-free regions having an area S2, the area ratio Rs of the fine-graphene-particles-free regions is determined by S2/(S1+S2)×100(%). By averaging area ratios Rs in electron photomicrographs (magnification: 500 times, size: 10 cm×10 cm) of three arbitrary fields in the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12, the area ratio of fine-graphene-particles-free regions is determined. When this area ratio is within 5%, it may be that the fine graphene particles are well dispersed. The area ratio of fine-graphene-particles-free regions is preferably within 2%, more preferably 0%. (2) Evaluation Method by Surface Roughness Because the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer comprises more fine graphene particles than a binder resin, fine-graphene-particles-aggregated regions are thicker than fine-graphene-particles-poor regions. Accordingly, the uniformity of the distribution of fine graphene particles can be determined by measuring the thickness distribution of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer. FIG. 5 shows a method of measuring the thickness distribution of electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12. With a test piece of an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film 1 having a predetermined size placed on a flat table, its surface roughness is measured along arbitrary straight lines L1, L2 . . . . FIG. 6(a) shows the surface roughness Ra of an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer without aggregated fine graphene particles, and FIG. 6(b) shows the surface roughness Ra of an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer with aggregated fine graphene particles. Any surface roughness Ra is subjected to a smoothing treatment. When the surface roughness Ra is small as shown in FIG. 6(a), it may be that the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 has a uniform distribution of fine graphene particles. On the other hand, when the surface roughness Ra is as large as shown in FIG. 6(b), the distribution of fine graphene particles is non-uniform. The uniformity of the distribution of fine graphene particles is expressed by the difference D between the maximum and minimum values of the surface roughness Ra. Therefore, differences D1, D2 . . . Dn are determined along pluralities of (n) arbitrary straight lines L1, L2 . . . Ln in the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12, and their average Day [Σ(D1+D2+ . . . +Dn)/n] is calculated. Day may be called “average thickness variation.” When the average thickness variation is within 20 μm, the distribution of fine graphene particles is sufficiently uniform. The number n of straight lines measured is 3 or more, preferably 5 or more. The average thickness variation is preferably within 15 μm, more preferably within 10 μm, most preferably within 5 μm. The surface roughness Ra of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 may be measured by a stylus surface roughness meter or a scanning electron microscope (SEM). (3) Evaluation Method by Light Transmittance The uniformity of the distribution of fine graphene particles can be determined by the light transmittance of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film 1. If fine graphene particles were completely uniformly dispersed, the light transmittance would be 0% as a whole. If some fine graphene particles were aggregated, the light transmittance would be higher as a whole, because light penetrates regions poor in or free of fine graphene particles. Accordingly, the degree of aggregation of fine graphene particles can be elevated by comparing the light transmittance. The light transmittance is measured on pluralities of test pieces arbitrarily cut out of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film 1, and the measured values are averaged. (e) Surface Resistance To exhibit sufficient electromagnetic wave absorbability, the surface resistance of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 is preferably 50-250 Ω/square, more preferably 100-200 Ω/square. The surface resistance is measured on a square test piece of 10 cm×10 cm cut out of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film 1 by a DC two-terminal method. In general, a uniform distribution of fine graphene particles provides the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 with smaller surface resistance. (f) Thickness The surface resistance of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 depends on the amount of fine graphene particles per a unit area, and the thickness of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 is determined by the amount of fine graphene particles. Thus, the thickness of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 having the above desired surface resistance is expressed by the amount of fine graphene particles per a unit area. The thickness of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 expressed by the amount of fine graphene particles per a unit area is preferably 2-15 g/m2, more preferably 3-12 g/m2, most preferably 4-8 g/m2. (3) Protective Film To prevent fine graphene particles from detaching, it is preferable to attach a protective film to the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12. The protective film per se may be made of the same polymer as that of the plastic film constituting the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film 1. Though the protective film can be bonded by an adhesive, it is preferably heat-fused for the simplification of bonding. In an example shown in FIG. 8(a), the protective film 1′ is a heat-fusible layer 13′ formed on the plastic film 11′. To have improved adhesion to the protective film 1′, the plastic film 11 of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film 1 is preferably provided with a heat-fusible layer 13. With the heat-fusible 13′ of the protective film 1′ heat-fused to the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12, the protective film 1′ is adhered to the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film 1, resulting in an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film laminate 1″, in which the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 is protected. Each heat-fusible layer 13, 13′ can be formed by low-melting-point polyethylene, etc. such as an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer. [2] Production Method of Electromagnetic-Wave-Absorbing Film (1) Preparation of Dispersion of Fine Graphene Particles A dispersion comprising fine graphene particles, a binder resin and an organic solvent is preferably prepared by mixing a dispersion of fine graphene particles in an organic solvent with a solution of a binder resin in an organic solvent. Because fine graphene particles are easily aggregated, fine graphene particles are likely aggregated when fine graphene particles and a binder resin are simultaneously added to an organic solvent. In a dispersion of fine graphene particles obtained by mixing both solutions, the concentration of fine graphene particles is preferably 1-10% by mass, more preferably 1-8% by mass, most preferably 2-8% by mass, particularly 2-7% by mass. The mass ratio of a binder resin to fine graphene particles is preferably 0.05-1, more preferably 0.05-0.5, most preferably 0.1-0.5. Preferable as the organic solvent used in the dispersion is an organic solvent well dispersing fine graphene particles, dissolving a binder resin, and easy to evaporate to shorten the drying time. Examples of such organic solvent include ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone, aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, aromatic hydrocarbons such as xylene, alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol, etc. Among them, methyl ethyl ketone, xylene, etc. are preferable. They may be used alone or in combination. (2) Application of Dispersion It has been found that when a dispersion having a desired concentration is applied to a plastic film 11 at a time, fine graphene particles 31 in the dispersion 3 are aggregated in a drying process as schematically shown in FIG. 9. This appears to be due to the fact that though aggregation does not occur in the dispersion 3 having a relatively low concentration of fine graphene particles 31, the percentage of the organic solvent 32 decreases in the drying process, resulting in increase in the concentration of fine graphene particles 32, which leads to aggregation. In FIG. 9, 33 indicates regions 32, in which fine graphene particles are aggregated. Intensive research has revealed that when the dispersion is divided to as small portions as possible to apply a small amount of the dispersion plural times, the aggregation of fine graphene particles 31 can be prevented. In the first application shown in FIG. 10, fine graphene particles 31 remain dispersed substantially horizontally without aggregation when a dispersion layer 3a is dried, because of a small amount of the dispersion layer 3a with sufficiently small thickness relative to the average diameter of fine graphene particles 31. Accordingly, in a layer 3a′ of a binder resin and fine graphene particles, which is obtained by drying the dispersion layer 3a, fine graphene particles 31 bonded with a small amount of the binder resin are distributed substantially uniformly and horizontally. When the second application of the dispersion is conducted on a dried layer 3a′ of the binder resin and fine graphene particles, as schematically shown in FIG. 11, a dispersion layer 3b comprising fine graphene particles 31 distributed substantially uniformly and horizontally is formed substantially without dissolving the layer 3a′ of the binder resin and fine graphene particles. Thus, with a small amount of the dispersion applied plural times, an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 free from thickness unevenness, in which fine graphene particles are substantially uniformly distributed, is obtained. The amount of a dispersion applied at a time is preferably 1-3.5 g/m2, more preferably 1-2.5 g/m2, most preferably 1-2 g/m2, when expressed by the weight of fine graphene particles per a unit area. Less than 1 g/m2 of the dispersion applied at a time makes the uniform dispersion of fine graphene particles rather difficult, and more than 3.5 g/m2 of the dispersion likely causes the aggregation of fine graphene particles. To apply such a small amount of the dispersion uniformly, a spraying method is preferable. After the applied dispersion is dried, the next application is conducted. Though the dispersion may be spontaneously dried, it may be heated to such an extent not to deform the plastic film to shorten the application step. The heating temperature is determined depending on the boiling point of an organic solvent used. For example, when methyl ethyl ketone is used, the heating temperature is preferably 30-100° C., more preferably 50-80° C. Drying until an organic solvent is completely evaporated from the applied dispersion is not needed, but drying may be conducted to such an extent to prevent fine graphene particles from moving by the next application. The number of cycles each comprising the application and drying of the dispersion may be generally about 3-6, though variable depending on the thickness of an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 to be formed. In the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 obtained by repeating the application and drying of the dispersion, the distribution of fine graphene particles 31 is sufficiently uniform. FIG. 12 schematically shows the application and drying step of a dispersion. In the depicted example, there are three application/drying regions of a dispersion. Each application/drying region comprises a dispersion-applying nozzle 43a, 43b, 43c and a drying heater 44a, 44b, 44c. In place of the drying heater, a hot air blower may be used. Each nozzle 43a, 43b, 43c continuously sprays the dispersion, and each drying heater 44a, 44b, 44c is always heating. The first and second drying heaters 44a, 44b have substantially the same length, and the third drying heater 44c is longer than the first and second drying heaters 44a, 44b. A plastic film 11 wound off a roll 41 continuously passes through three application/drying regions. In the first application/drying region, a dispersion sprayed from a nozzle 43a is dried by a heater 44a to form a first layer of a binder resin and fine graphene particles. In the second application/drying region, a dispersion sprayed from a nozzle 43b is dried by a heater 44b to form a second layer of a binder resin and fine graphene particles. At this time, of course, the dispersion is applied and dried in the first application/drying region, too. In the third application/drying region, a dispersion sprayed from a nozzle 43c is dried by a heater 44c to form a third layer of a binder resin and fine graphene particles. At this time, of course, the dispersion is applied and dried in the first and second application/drying regions, too. Because the heater 44c in the third application/drying region is longer than the heaters 44a, 44b in the first and second application/drying regions, the dispersion can be sufficiently dried. Because the dispersion may be dried in the first and second application/drying regions, to such an extent that the distribution of fine graphene particles in the binder resin/fine graphene particles layer is not disturbed by the next application of the dispersion (need not be completely dried), the dispersion should be completely dried in the final drying step. The plastic film 11 exiting from the third application/drying region is provided with an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 constituted by laminated binder resin/fine graphene particles layers. A protective film 1′ is adhered to this electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12. The adhesion of the protective film 1′ is preferably carried out by heat lamination using a pair of rolls 45a, 45b. An electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film laminate 1″ obtained by adhering the protective film 1′ is wound around a roll 42. [3] Absorbability of Near-Field Electromagnetic Wave Noise Using a system comprising a 50-Ω microstripline MSL (64.4 mm×4.4 mm), an insulating substrate 50 supporting the microstripline MSL, a grounded electrode 51 attached to a lower surface of the insulating substrate 50, conductive pins 52, 52 connected to both ends of the microstripline MSL, a network analyzer NA, and coaxial cables 53, 53 connecting the network analyzer NA to the conductive pins 52, 52 as shown in FIGS. 13(a) and 13(b), reflected wave power S11 and transmitted wave power S12 to input waves of 0.1-6 GHz were measured on a test piece TP2 of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film adhered to the microstripline MSL. Power loss Ploss is determined by subtracting the reflected wave power S11 and the transmitted wave power S12 from the input power Pin, and a noise absorption ratio Ploss/Pin is determined by dividing Ploss by the input power Pin. The present invention will be explained in further detail by Examples below, without intention of restricting the present invention thereto. Example 1 Each dispersion comprising flaky fine graphene particles (“M-25” available from XG Sciences, average diameter: 25 μm, and average thickness: about 6-8 nm) in an amount shown in Table 1, and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) in a half amount of the fine graphene particles, the balance being a mixed solvent of xylene and isopropyl alcohol (mass ratio: 60/40), was applied to a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film 11 as thick as 16 μm, and dried at 50° C. for 5 minutes, to form a fine graphene particles/PMMA layer having a thickness shown in Table 1. This procedure of forming each fine graphene particles/PMMA layer was repeated three times in total to form an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film 1, which had electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 composed of fine graphene particles and PMMA having a thickness shown in Table 1. The surface resistance of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 measured by a DC two-terminal method is shown in Table 1. Light transmittance was measured on three test pieces (10 cm×10 cm) arbitrarily cut out of each electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film 1, and averaged. The average light transmittance is expressed by %, assuming that the light transmittance of the plastic film per se is 100%. The results are shown in Table 1.

A 16-μm-thick PET film 11′ having a 10-μm-thick heat-fusible layer 13′ as a protective film 1′ was heat-laminated to each electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film 1, with the heat-fusible layer 13′ on the side of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12, thereby obtaining an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film laminate 1″. With a test piece TP2 (55.2 mm×4.7 mm) cut out of an arbitrary portion of each electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film laminate 1″ adhered to a microstripline MSL in the system shown in FIGS. 13(a) and 13(b), its reflected wave power S11 in a frequency of 1-6 GHz was measured and averaged. The relation between average S11 and the thickness of the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 is shown in FIG. 14.

As is clear from FIG. 25, the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 of Comparative Example 1 had extremely large surface roughness, with thickness variation of about 26 μm. Comparative Example 2 An electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 was formed in the same manner as in Example 1 except for changing the concentration of fine graphene particles in the dispersion to 12% by mass. The electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 had surface resistance of 500 Ω/square or more and as large average light transmittance as 10%. This indicates that when the concentration of fine graphene particles in the dispersion is too high, an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 with large thickness variation, in which fine graphene particles are aggregated, is formed, even though the dispersion is divided to conduct application 3 times. Comparative Example 3 An electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 was formed in the same manner as in Example 1, except for changing the concentrations of fine graphene particles and PMMA in the dispersion to 3% by mass and 5% by mass, respectively. The electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer 12 had as large surface resistance as 5000 Ω/square or more. This indicates that too large a mass ratio of PMMA (binder resin) to fine graphene particles in the dispersion provides too large surface resistance. Effect of the Invention Because the electromagnetic-wave-absorbing film of the present invention comprises an electromagnetic-wave-absorbing layer containing flaky fine graphene particles uniformly dispersed therein, it exhibits high absorbability to electromagnetic wave noises of several hundreds of MHz to several GHz, without absorbability variation. Accordingly, even if it were cut to desired sizes, excellent electromagnetic wave absorbability can be exhibited without unevenness. The electromagnetic-wave-absorbing films of the present invention having such features are effective for the absorption of near-field electromagnetic wave noises of several hundreds of MHz to several GHz, in various mobile information terminals such as cell phones, smartphones, etc., and electronic appliances such as personal computers, etc. 1-11.
