Example 482A
tert-Butyl 2-carbamoyl-2-{[5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-1-(tetrahydrofuran-2-ylmethyl)-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-d]pyrimidin-6-yl]methyl}hydrazinecarboxylate (racemate)
To a solution of 1.12 g (2.27 mmol) of the compound from Ex. 423A in 50 ml of isopropanol were added 610 μl (4.55 mmol) of trimethylsilyl isocyanate, and the mixture was stirred at RT for about 18 h. Then a further 305 μl (2.27 mmol) of trimethylsilyl isocyanate were added and the stirring was continued at RT for 2 days. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was concentrated to dryness. The remaining residue was purified by MPLC (Biotage Isolera, cartridge with 100 g of silica gel, cyclohexane/ethyl acetate 1:1→dichloromethane/methanol 20:1). The product fractions were combined, concentrated by evaporation and dried under high vacuum. 810 mg (66% of theory) of the title compound were obtained.
