Step 7. tert-Butyl 7-(1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)-6-fluoro-8-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline-2(1H)-carboxylate
To a screw-cap vial equipped waft a magnetic stir oar was added tert-butyl 5-chloro-1H-pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine-1-carboxylate (882.4 mg, 3.46 mmol), chloro(2-dicyclohexylphosphino-2',4',6'-triisopropyl-1,1'-biphenyl)[2-(2'-amino-1,1'-biphenyl)]palladium(II) (XPhos Pd G2, 372.5 mg, 0.473 mmol) and cesium carbonate (3138 mg, 9.63 mmol). The vial was sealed with a Teflon-lined septum, evacuated and backfilled with nitrogen (this process was repeated a total of three times). A solution of tert-butyl 6-fluoro-8-methyl-7-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline-2(1H)-carboxylate (step 6) in 1,4-dioxane (12.0 ml) was added via syringe, followed by water (4.0 ml). The reaction was stirred at 50Â° C. for 16 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was diluted with CH2Cl2 and washed with brine. The organic layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and concentrated. The residue was purified on silica gel (40 g, 0-100% EtOAc in hexanes) to give the desired product as a yellow foamy solid (735.5 mg, 48% over two steps).
