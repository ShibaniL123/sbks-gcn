STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT [0002] This invention was made with government support under Grant No. DA029961 awarded by the National Institutes on Drug Abuse. The United States Government has certain rights in the invention. 1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION [0003] This invention relates generally to the discovery of pyrazole compounds selective for the neurotensin receptor 2 (NTS2) and uses thereof. 2. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 2.1. Introduction [0004] Neurotensin (NT) is a tridecapeptide (Glu-Leu-Tyr-Glu-Asn-Lys-Pro-Arg-Arg- Pro-Tyr-Ile-Leu) that was identified forty years ago from bovine hypothalamus -. NT functions as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator demonstrating a range of biological actions. In the CNS, NT is co-localized with and regulates the action of mesolimbic and nigrastriatal dopamine— as well as mediating non-opioid analgesia and hypothermia -' -. It is believed that NT operates primarily through interaction with two G-protein coupled receptors NTS1 and NTS2 (also referred to as NTR1, NTR2, NTRH, NTRL and others) to regulate these activities though a third receptor, NTS3, is known to exist bearing but a single transmembrane domain— . The ability of the NT receptor system to regulate CNS dopamine led researchers to postulate that NT might be an endogenous neuroleptic— and that drugs acting via the NT system might therefore be useful as anti -psychotic agents— '— . [0005] Abuse of methamphetamine also produces profound disruption of dopamine flow in the mesolimbic and nigrastriatal dopamine networks with chronic methamphetamine exposure eliciting behaviors resembling schizophrenia— » 12 it is thus no surprise that compounds acting via the NT network are now being investigated as potential treatments for methamphetamine abuse— '— . [0006] The neurotensin system also plays an important role in the pain processing network -'— . The non-opioid analgesia mediated by the NT system has also generated much interest over the years as a potential means of circumventing the side effects produced by opioid analgesics including addiction and respiratory depression. NT mediated analgesia has been demonstrated with compounds selective for both the NTS 1 and NTS2 receptors as well as non-selective compounds 22.2Z Beyond this, there is now substantial evidence that both NTSl and NTS2 can mediate relief from chronic or neuropathic pain, a persistent form of pain that arises from nerve damage— . This type of pain is difficult to treat with current drugs and does not respond well to opioid therapy— . Taken together with their neuroleptic activity, it is easy to understand why the development of compounds acting via the NT network has engendered so much interest. 3.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [0022] This invention provides compounds acting at the neurotensin 2 receptor (NTS2) that are active in animal models of chronic pain and those selective for NTS2 versus the neurotensin 1 receptor (NTSl) that do not display the side effects of hypotension and hypothermia. Levocabastine (6, Livostin™), a non-peptide HI histamine antagonist, is also active at NTS2 and was found to be selective for NTS2 versus NTSl many years ago. Recently this compound has been shown to be efficacious in a model of neuropathic pain. With the aim of identifying novel compounds selective for NTS2, the literature reports of calcium release stimulated by the potent NTS1 antagonists SR48692 (5a, Meclinertant™) and SR142948 (5b) in CHO cells stably expressing the NTS2 receptor, prompted us to follow up these findings to determine if this calcium response could be used to guide structure activity relationship (SAR) studies. In testing, we found levocabastine to be a potent partial agonist of calcium release in this assay relative to 5b. Using these NTS2 cells in a FLIPR assay in concert with an NTS1 calcium release assay, we were able to identify a levocabastine-like NTS2 selective compound l-({ [l-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(2-methoxyphenyl)- lH-pyrazol-3-yl]carbonyl}amino)cyclohexane carboxylic acid (NTRC-739, 7b) starting from the non-selective compound SR48692 (5a). Radioligand binding experiments carried out on the test compounds described herein confirmed a positive correlation between binding affinity at NTS2 and NTS2 mediated calcium mobilization. Comparison of the data obtained for 7b from NTS2 and NTS1 binding assays provided additional confirmation of the selectivity of compound 7b for NTS2. 5.1.

Osmotic Controlled Release Devices [0096] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated using an osmotic controlled release device, including one-chamber system, two-chamber system, asymmetric membrane technology (AMT), and extruding core system (ECS). In general, such devices have at least two components: (a) the core which contains the active ingredient(s); and (b) a semipermeable membrane with at least one delivery port, which encapsulates the core. The semipermeable membrane controls the influx of water to the core from an aqueous environment of use so as to cause drug release by extrusion through the delivery port(s). [0097] In addition to the active ingredient(s), the core of the osmotic device optionally includes an osmotic agent, which creates a driving force for transport of water from the environment of use into the core of the device. One class of osmotic agents water- swellable hydrophilic polymers, which are also referred to as "osmopolymers" and "hydrogels," including, but not limited to, hydrophilic vinyl and acrylic polymers, polysaccharides such as calcium alginate, polyethylene oxide (PEO), polyethylene glycol (PEG), polypropylene glycol (PPG), poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate), poly(acrylic) acid, poly(methacrylic) acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), crosslinked PVP, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), PVA/PVP copolymers, PVA/PVP copolymers with hydrophobic monomers such as methyl methacrylate and vinyl acetate, hydrophilic polyurethanes containing large PEO blocks, sodium croscarmellose, carrageenan, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and carboxyethyl, cellulose (CEC), sodium alginate, polycarbophil, gelatin, xanthan gum, and sodium starch glycolate. [0098] The other class of osmotic agents is osmogens, which are capable of imbibing water to affect an osmotic pressure gradient across the barrier of the surrounding coating. Suitable osmogens include, but are not limited to, inorganic salts, such as magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, lithium chloride, potassium sulfate, potassium phosphates, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfite, lithium sulfate, potassium chloride, and sodium sulfate; sugars, such as dextrose, fructose, glucose, inositol, lactose, maltose, mannitol, raffinose, sorbitol, sucrose, trehalose, and xylitol, organic acids, such as ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, sebacic acid, sorbic acid, adipic acid, edetic acid, glutamic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid; urea; and mixtures thereof [0099] Osmotic agents of different dissolution rates can be employed to influence how rapidly the active ingredient(s) is initially delivered from the dosage form. For example, amorphous sugars, such as MANNOGEM™ EZ (SPI Pharma, Lewes, DE) can be used to provide faster delivery during the first couple of hours to promptly produce the desired therapeutic effect, and gradually and continually release of the remaining amount to maintain the desired level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended period of time. In this case, the active ingredient(s) is released at such a rate to replace the amount of the active ingredient metabolized and excreted. [00100] The core can also include a wide variety of other excipients and carriers as described herein to enhance the performance of the dosage form or to promote stability or processing. [00101] Materials useful in forming the semipermeable membrane include various grades of acrylics, vinyls, ethers, polyamides, polyesters, and cellulosic derivatives that are water- permeable and water-insoluble at physiologically relevant pHs, or are susceptible to being rendered water-insoluble by chemical alteration, such as crosslinking Examples of suitable polymers useful in forming the coating, include plasticized, unplasticized, and reinforced cellulose acetate (CA), cellulose diacetate, cellulose triacetate, CA propionate, cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CA ethyl carbamate, CAP, CA methyl carbamate, CA succinate, cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT), CA dimethylaminoacetate, CA ethyl carbonate, CA chloroacetate, CA ethyl oxalate, CA methyl sulfonate, CA butyl sulfonate, CA p-toluene sulfonate, agar acetate, amylose triacetate, beta glucan acetate, beta glucan triacetate, acetaldehyde dimethyl acetate, triacetate of locust bean gum, hydroxylated ethylene-vinylacetate, EC, PEG, PPG, PEG/PPG copolymers, PVP, HEC, HPC, CMC, CMEC, HPMC, HPMCP, HPMCAS, HPMCAT, poly(acrylic) acids and esters and poly- (methacrylic) acids and esters and copolymers thereof, starch, dextran, dextrin, chitosan, collagen, gelatin, polyalkenes, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. [00102] Semipermeable membrane can also be a hydrophobic microporous membrane, wherein the pores are substantially filled with a gas and are not wetted by the aqueous medium but are permeable to water vapor, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,798,119. Such hydrophobic but water-vapor permeable membrane are typically composed of hydrophobic polymers such as polyalkenes, polyethylene, polypropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, polyacrylic acid derivatives, polyethers, polysulfones, polyethersulfones, polystyrenes, polyvinyl halides, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyvinyl esters and ethers, natural waxes, and synthetic waxes. [00103] The delivery port(s) on the semipermeable membrane can be formed post-coating by mechanical or laser drilling. Delivery port(s) can also be formed in situ by erosion of a plug of water-soluble material or by rupture of a thinner portion of the membrane over an indentation in the core. In addition, delivery ports can be formed during coating process, as in the case of asymmetric membrane coatings of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,612,059 and 5,698,220, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety. [00104] The total amount of the active ingredient(s) released and the release rate can substantially by modulated via the thickness and porosity of the semipermeable membrane, the composition of the core, and the number, size, and position of the delivery ports. [00105] The pharmaceutical compositions in an osmotic controlled-release dosage form can further comprise additional conventional excipients or carriers as described herein to promote performance or processing of the formulation. [00106] The osmotic controlled-release dosage forms can be prepared according to conventional methods and techniques known to those skilled in the art.

Multiparticulate Controlled Release Devices [00109] The pharmaceutical compositions provided herein in a modified release dosage form can be fabricated as a multiparticulate controlled release device, which comprises a multiplicity of particles, granules, or pellets, ranging from about 10 μιη to about 3 mm, about 50 μιη to about 2.5 mm, or from about 100 μιη to about 1 mm in diameter. Such multiparticulates can be made by the processes known to those skilled in the art, including wet-and dry-granulation, extrusion/spheronization, roller-compaction, melt-congealing, and by spray-coating seed cores. See, for example, Multiparticulate Oral Drug Delivery; Marcel Dekker: 1994; and Pharmaceutical Pelletization Technology; Marcel Dekker: 1989. [00110] Other excipients or carriers as described herein can be blended with the pharmaceutical compositions to aid in processing and forming the multiparticulates. The resulting particles can themselves constitute the multiparticulate device or can be coated by various film-forming materials, such as enteric polymers, water-swellable, and water-soluble polymers. The multiparticulates can be further processed as a capsule or a tablet. 5.4. Dosage [00111] The pharmaceutical compositions that are provided can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. An "effective amount" refers generally to an amount that is a sufficient, but non-toxic, amount of the active ingredient (i.e., a selective NTS2 compound) to achieve the desired effect, which is a reduction or elimination in the severity and/or frequency of symptoms and/or improvement or remediation of damage. A "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount that is sufficient to remedy a disease state or symptoms, or otherwise prevent, hinder, retard or reverse the progression of a disease or any other undesirable symptom. A "prophylactically effective amount" refers to an amount that is effective to prevent, hinder or retard the onset of a disease state or symptom. [00112] In general, toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the <NAME> can be determined according to standard pharmaceutical procedures in cell cultures and/or experimental animals, including, for example, determining the LD50 (the dose lethal to 50% of the population) and the ED50 (the dose therapeutically effective in 50% of the population). The dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be expressed as the ratio LD50/ED50. Compositions that exhibit large therapeutic indices are preferred. [00113] The data obtained from cell culture and/or animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosages for humans. The dosage of the active ingredient typically lines within a range of circulating concentrations that include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage can vary within this range depending upon the dosage form employed and the route of administration utilized. [00114] The effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition comprising a selective NTS2 compound to be employed therapeutically or prophylactically will depend, for example, upon the therapeutic context and objectives. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the appropriate dosage levels for treatment, according to certain embodiments, will thus vary depending, in part, upon the molecule delivered, the indication for which the <NAME> is being used, the route of administration, and the size (body weight, body surface or organ size) and/or condition (the age and general health) of the patient. A clinician may titer the dosage and modify the route of administration to obtain the optimal therapeutic effect. Typical dosages range from about 0.1 μg/kg to up to about 100 mg/kg or more, depending on the factors mentioned above. In certain embodiments, the dosage may range from 0.1 μg/kg up to about 150 mg/kg; or 1 μg/kg up to about 100 mg/kg; or 5 μg/kg up to about 50 mg/kg. [00115] The dosing frequency will depend upon the pharmacokinetic parameters of the <NAME> in the formulation. For example, a clinician will administer the composition until a dosage is reached that achieves the desired effect. The composition may therefore be administered as a single dose or as two or more doses (which may or may not contain the same amount of the desired molecule) over time, or as a continuous infusion via an implantation device or catheter. Treatment may be continuous over time or intermittent. Further refinement of the appropriate dosage is routinely made by those of ordinary skill in the art and is within the ambit of tasks routinely performed by them. Appropriate dosages may be ascertained through use of appropriate dose-response data. [00116] Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. The article "a" and "an" are used herein to refer to one or more than one (i.e., to at least one) of the grammatical object(s) of the article. By way of example, "an element" means one or more elements. [00117] Throughout the specification the word "comprising," or variations such as "comprises" or "comprising," will be understood to imply the inclusion of a stated element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps, but not the exclusion of any other element, integer or step, or group of elements, integers or steps. The present invention may suitably "comprise", "consist of, or "consist essentially of, the steps, elements, and/or reagents described in the claims. [00118] It is further noted that the claims may be drafted to exclude any optional element. As such, this statement is intended to serve as antecedent basis for use of such exclusive terminology as "solely", "only" and the like in connection with the recitation of claim elements, or the use of a "negative" limitation. [00119] Where a range of values is provided, it is understood that each intervening value, to the tenth of the unit of the lower limit unless the context clearly dictates otherwise, between the upper and lower limits of that range is also specifically disclosed. Each smaller range between any stated value or intervening value in a stated range and any other stated or intervening value in that stated range is encompassed within the invention. The upper and lower limits of these smaller ranges may independently be included or excluded in the range, and each range where either, neither or both limits are included in the smaller ranges is also encompassed within the invention, subject to any specifically excluded limit in the stated range. Where the stated range includes one or both of the limits, ranges excluding either or both of those included limits are also included in the invention. [00120] The following Examples further illustrate the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. In particular, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to particular embodiments described, as such may, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to be limiting, since the scope of the present invention will be limited only by the appended claims. 6. EXAMPLES [00121] Several important milestone compounds from NT receptor research are depicted in Chart 1. The NT(8-13) fragment of NT, compound 1, is as potent as the full length peptide— and several hexapeptide variants of 1 have been reported over the years that either favor NTS2 over NTS1 or are selective for NTS2 versus NTS1. The first of these is JMV-431 (2) that was produced via reduction of the tyrosine 11 amide bond and shows a clear preference for NTS2— '— . While it is not bioavailable, it is active in several models of chronic pain when dosed intrathecally— '— . The peptide NT79 (3), reported more recently by Boules et al.— , is selective for NTS2 (> 100-fold) and provided a wealth of information regarding the role of NTS2 in animal models of pain, anti-psychotic activity, thermoregulation and regulation of blood pressure— . Like peptide 2, this compound attained NTS2 selectivity via modification of the tyrosine 11 residue. The most recent additions to the rolls of NTS2 selective compounds are the potent peptide-peptoid hybrids 4a and 4b— '— . These compounds are ultra- selective for NTS2 with selectivity ratios reaching 12,000 and 22,000-fold respectively and with 4b also demonstrating excellent plasma stability. [00122] Though few in number, there are three prominent non-peptide compounds that interact with NTS2 that have been used extensively in the characterization of the NT receptors. These include the two pyrazole-based compounds SR48692 (5a) and SR142948 (5b) and the histamine blocker levocabastine (6) Pyrazole compound 5a prefers NTS1 to NTS2 while 5b is non-selective but they both antagonize the activity of NT at NTS1. Compound 6 is selective for NTS2 versus NTS 1 but it is also a potent antagonist at histamine receptor 1 (HI). These compounds (5a, 5b and 6) highlight the fact that while NTS2 selective peptides exist, selective non-peptides compounds have yet to be identified. [00123] The paucity of selective non-peptide compounds suggested to us that screening efforts at the NTS2 receptor had either not been attempted or had never been reported despite that fact that the receptor had been reportedly expressed in numerous cell lines. We imagined that this could have arisen from the literature reports of NTS2 experiments that yielded seemingly contradictory data from the heterologously expressed NTS2 receptor. Indeed, NT has been reported to be an agonist, an inverse agonist and a neutral antagonist depending upon the expression system Similar findings were reported for compounds 5a, 5b and 6 as well when tested alongside NT in these systems. Specifically, the potent NTS1 antagonists 5a and 5b were found to be agonists at NTS2 as they mobilized calcium release at NTS2 while levocabastine (6) was found to be a weak partial inverse agonist— '— '— . [00124] At the front end of our effort to find novel NTS2 active compounds, the actual biological disposition of NT was of less than concern than identifying a means of screening compound libraries. From this perspective, we viewed the reports above as an opportunity to accomplish this task. Working on the hypothesis that the calcium release described in these reports was NTS2 mediated, we studied the calcium release produced by the non-peptide compounds 5a and 5b in a CHO cell line expressing rNTS2. Using a FLIPR® tetra system, we examined analogs of 5a measuring their ability to either stimulate release of calcium or to block the calcium release stimulated by 5b and found that it responded to changes in structure. In this manner, we were able to identify, both directly and indirectly, those compounds that interact with NTS2 as well as determine activities relative to 5b. [00125] We also compared the data collected from the FLIPR assay to the binding affinity data in competition with 125I-NT for a set of analogs of 5a. This study revealed a positive correlation between binding affinity and calcium modulation for the NTS2 receptor; compounds that modulated calcium release also competed with NT for binding at NTS2. Using this method we have screened a variety of compound libraries and have identified a number of non-peptide NTS2 selective compounds. In this report we provide the details of our effort that led to the identification of a novel NTS2 selective potent partial agonist 1-({[1- (4-fluorophenyl)-5-(2-methoxyphenyl)-lH-pyrazol-3-yl]carbonyl}amino)cyclohexane carboxylic acid (NTRC-739, 7b) starting from a nonselective full NTS2 agonist compound 5a (SR48692). [00126] Chemistry Section [00127] The target compounds, depicted in Tables 2 and 3, were synthesized as described in Schemes 1-2 (Figures 3 and Figure 4). Elemental analysis for key compounds appears in Table 5. Commercially available materials were used where possible. Those not commercially available were prepared according to literature precedent. Scheme 1 illustrates the synthesis of the key intermediate pyrazole carboxylic acids (lla-j). These were prepared as described by Labeeuw— , though improved methods were recently described by Jiang et al. — and Baxendale et al.— This employed a Knorr [3+2]-cyclization reaction between 4-aryl- 2,4-diketoesters (8a-f) and arylhydrazines 9a-c in acetic acid at reflux. The resulting esters lOa-j were hydrolyzed using LiOH and dioxane to give lla-j. The 4-aryl-2,4-diketoesters were commercially available with the exception of 8b. The 2,6-dimethoxy-butyrophenone used to synthesize compound 8b was prepared exactly as described by Lindh— . [00128] In Scheme 2 the synthetic methods used to produce target compounds 7b, 13, 14b-29b, 30 and 31 are described. Thus, a given pyrazole carboxylic acid (lla-j) and amino acid ester (12a-d) or amine (12e) from Chart 2 were coupled using O-benzotriazol-l-yl- N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) and triethylamine to give ester intermediates 7a,14a-29a and the descarboxy target compound 13. The ester intermediates 7a, 14a- 29a were hydrolyzed to give final products using either basic (LiOH and dioxane) or acidic (trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in CH2CI2) conditions as shown. We used the tert-butyl rather than the methyl esters of L-cyclohexylglycine (12d) to avoid racemization of the chiral amino acid. We used the basic conditions for hydrolysis of achiral amino acid esters. The synthesis of target compounds 30 and 31 was accomplished according to the method of Quere — wherein pyrazole acids Hi and l lj were converted to the acid chloride using SOCI2 in toluene, followed by coupling of the acid chloride intermediate with the adamantyl amino acid 12f under Schotten-Bauman conditions. The adamantyl amino acid 12f was prepared exactly as described by Nagasawa— . [00129] Biological Results [00130] The binding affinities of the test compounds for the rNTSl and rNTS2 receptors listed in Tables 1 through 4 were determined using previously reported competitive binding assays— . The NTS1 and 2 receptors were labeled using 125I-NT. The cells used in the binding assay were CHO-kl cells (American Type Culture Collection) engineered to over-express either the rNTSl or rNTS2 receptor. Measures of functional agonism and antagonism were obtained by measuring changes in intensity of a calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye as an indirect measure of changes in internal calcium concentrations. These measurements were performed using a FLIPR Tetra (NTS2) or a FlexStation II plate reader for NTS 1 (Molecular Devices) and were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. Antagonism was measured as inhibition of NT-induced calcium release (NTS1) or inhibition of SR142948 (5b)-induced calcium release (NTS2). [00131] Results and Discussion [00132] The screening of compound libraries to identify starting points for new drug discovery is a common practice. The radioligand binding method of screening compound libraries presents a significant challenge as the size of a library is increased, as this requires significant amounts of an expensive radioligand. In addition, radioligand binding studies yield no information regarding the functional characteristics (agonist, antagonist etc.) of the hits. The FLIPR tetra system, on the other hand, is a functional assay that can be used to screen libraries quickly and cheaply using calcium release as an end point. The calcium release reported for compounds 5a and 5b in NTS2 cell lines presented an opportunity to harness this alternative technology to speed along discovery efforts for NTS2 selective non- peptide compounds. To determine the usefulness of such an approach, we analyzed the compounds commonly used in NT receptor research. In Table 1, we have summarized the calcium release and binding data obtained for NT, NT(8-13) (1), as well as the NTS1 antagonist pyrazole-based compounds 5a and 5b, and the NTS2 selective compound levocabastine (6) in both our NTS1 and NTS2 cell lines. [00133] In our CHO-kl-NTS2 cell line neither NT nor the NT(8-13) fragment (1) showed any calcium release in our FLIPR assay. The NTS1 antagonists 5a and 5b, on the other hand, stimulated calcium release with EC50 values of 120 and 20 nM, respectively. Compound 5b was more potent than compound 5a in both the calcium release and binding assays (described below) and was thereby designated as our NTS2 full agonist standard (the use of the term agonist here refers to a compound that stimulates calcium release in this assay). Levocabastine (6), a compound used for years to distinguish NTS1 from NTS2, was also tested and found to be a potent partial agonist with an EC50 of 28 nM and an Emax of 16% relative to 5b. [00134] While NT and NT(8-13) (1) did not stimulate calcium release, they both blocked the calcium release stimulated by compound 5b in an insurmountable manner as they showed a rightward shift in the dose response curve with an accompanying dose-dependent drop in the Emax value of 5b —'— . We thus determined and report the IC50 for both NT and 1 in competition with 5b and found these to be 18.9 and 5.4 nM, respectively. [00135] We also examined these compounds in a radioligand binding assay in the NTS2 cell line using 125I-NT. We found that compound 5a gave a Ki of 62 nM while 5b showed a ten-fold more potent Ki of 6 nM. As in the FLIPR assay, compound 5b is more potent than 5a. NT gave a ¾ of 18.5 nM, similar to its K; for blocking the calcium release stimulated by compound 5b. NT(8-13) showed similar affinity to NT while levocabastine (6) gave a K; of 33 nM. The binding affinities found for NT, 1 and levocabastine were slightly higher than found in other laboratories while those for 5a and b are similar. We attribute this to our use of an in-plate whole cell binding method— as opposed to the use of membrane preparations. [00136] In the NTS1 FLIPR assay, the activity of each of the reference compounds was found to be within expectation. Thus, NT and 1 showed potent stimulation of calcium release at NTS1 with EC50 values of 0.04 and 0.01 nM, respectively while compounds 5a and b blocked NT mediated calcium release with Ke values of 4.7 and 1.5 nM, respectively. The NTS2 selective compound levocabastine (6) showed neither agonist nor antagonist activity toward NT-mediated calcium release, as expected. [00137] The data obtained from the testing of these reference compounds suggested that this calcium release assay would be useful for detecting NTS2 mediated activity in novel compounds. First, each compound that either stimulated or blocked calcium release in this NTS2 cell line also possessed the ability to compete with NT for binding. This implies that the calcium release observed in this assay is the result of interaction between the test compound and the NTS2 receptor. This assertion was strengthened by the fact that these same compounds produce no effects in the parent CHO-kl cells not transfected with the NTS2 receptor (data not shown). Third, the assay proved capable of identifying a range of activities from potent agonist (5a and b) to partial agonist (6) to antagonist (NT and 1) implying that the structure of the compound made a direct impact on the resulting mobilization of calcium. [00138] In a separate experiment, we compared the activity of compound 5a to its descarboxy derivative 13 (Scheme 1) as the carboxyl group is known to be a primary attachment point for ligands of the neurotensin receptors We found that compound 13 was inactive in both NTS1 and NTS2 FLIPR assays (Table 1) and gave a ¾ > l luM in the radioligand binding assay. Thus, the behavior of 13 stands in stark contrast to the activity found for 5a and provided additional evidence that the calcium release observed for 5a (and 5b) results from these ligands interacting with NTS2. [00139] As described earlier, NT possesses neuroleptic activity and mediates non-opioid analgesia while both NT and levocabastine (6) are active in models of chronic pain— '— . The pyrazole compounds 5a and 5b, on the other hand, are not analgesics in vivo but instead block the analgesic activity of NT in animal models of pain— '— '— . This is also observed in animal models based on runaway mesolimbic dopamine where the neuroleptic action of NT is blocked by compounds 5a and 5b— '— '— '— . The data (Table 1) showed that in our CHO- NTS2 expression system the proven analgesic and anti-psychotic compounds appear as either antagonists of calcium release (NT and peptide 1) or potent partial agonists of calcium release (levocabastine, 6). The compounds that possess neither analgesic nor anti-psychotic activity in vivo, compounds 5a and 5b, appeared as potent agonists of calcium release. This point of reference provided a means of parsing active compounds into two categories, those that might possess desirable behaviors in animal models and those that might not. Based on these two types of in vitro behaviors our search for novel compounds followed two pathways, one for NTS2 selective antagonists and one for NTS2 selective potent partial agonists. [00140] In this document we provide a summary of the key SAR elements discovered while testing this calcium release assay that led to the identification of the potent partial agonist NTRC-739 (7b). Each of the appended molecular regions of 5a are discussed herein and include: the dimethoxyphenyl ring, the amino acid side chain, the 7-chloroquinoline ring, and the 4-position of the pyrazole ring. The data obtained from this representative set of compounds are provided in Tables 2 and 3 and include the NTS2 ECso as well the NTS 1 Ke and the NTS2 binding affinity (Ki). Also, in the preparation of compound libraries, we used the L-cyclohexyl glycine side chain seen in 14b (Table 2) as a surrogate for the adamantyl group in compound 5a as we found it easier to produce and isolate en masse. Compound 14b, like 5a, was reported to be a potent NTS 1 antagonist by Quere— and thus was expected to be an agonist in the NTS2 assay given the results obtained for 5a and 5b. The data from 14b indicated that it would be a suitable stand in for 5a as it provided comparable agonist potency and efficacy for NTS2 (ECso of 217 and Emax 86% of 5b) and NTS1 antagonist activity (Ke of 23 nM). The 10-fold difference in its relative binding affinity at NTS2 demonstrated that the structure of the amino acid side chain significantly impacts binding affinity. [00141] A comparison of the data obtained for compounds 14b-18b (Table 2) illustrates the SAR realized from changing the position of the 6-methoxy group (14b, 15b, 16b) or from the elimination of the 6-methoxy group (17b) and from replacing the 2,6-methoxy groups with fluorine atoms (18b). The NTS1 antagonist activity fell off significantly across the series of positional isomers 14b-16b with Ke values of 23 nM, 1275 nM and >10 μΜ respectively. The same was seen for 17b and the di-fluoro derivative (18b) with Ke values of 1682 nM and >10 μΜ. The NTS2 efficacy of calcium release also fell across this series of compounds while the potency was little varied. In line with the latter, the binding affinities across this same series of compounds showed surprisingly little variation compared with the change seen going between 5a and 14b. As the amino acid side chain wasn't varied in 14b- 18b, this information reinforced the notion that the structure of the amino acid side chain has a strong impact on binding affinity and appeared to control the range of activity. Overall, we found that the potency of antagonist activity for 14b at the NTS 1 receptor relied heavily upon the 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl ring for its activity. At NTS2, it was the efficacy of calcium release that was most significantly affected by alteration of the 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl ring. The binding affinity data and NTS2 potency, on the other hand, appeared to move in line with one another and were much less affected by changes to this molecular region. [00142] On the whole, compounds 14b-18b showed a shift towards behavior mimicking the NTS2 selective partial agonist levocabastine. This included significantly weakened antagonist activity at NTS1 (higher Ke) and lowered efficacy at NTS2 (Emax) with little impact on NTS2 potency (EC50) leaning toward improved NTS2 selectivity. However, the low NTS2 affinity and potency of these compounds suggested that alternative structural changes would be required to more closely align with levocabastine. [00143] The data from compound 19b illustrated the effect on in vitro activity produced by alkylation of the 4-position of the pyrazole ring. The changes seen here resembled the previous set of compounds as the NTS1 antagonist activity fell off significantly relative to 14b with a Ke shift from 23 nM to >10 μΜ and the NTS2 efficacy was also decreased with Emax values of 86 for 14b to 15% of 5b for 19b. The NTS2 potency was also decreased compared with 14b (EC50 values of 120 and 94 nM for 14b and 19b respectively) and the binding affinity of 19b also fell in the range of the previous set of compounds presumably because it bore the L-cyclohexylglycine side chain. The fact that the structural change in 19b provided data that appeared to be an extension of the SAR seen in the changes to the dimethoxyphenyl ring is likely related to the close proximity of these two structural features within the molecule. This, in turn, suggests that the ethyl group could be preventing rotation of the phenyl ring or that it could be interfering with a cation-π bond. Irrespective of mechanism, this example illustrates that alkylation of this position provided compounds that favored NTS2 activity over NTS1 but with unacceptably low levels of affinity at NTS2. [00144] As seen above, the amino acid side chain in compounds like 5a is known to have a strong influence on ligand behavior presumably due to its proximity to the carboxyl group, the primary anchoring point of the ligand to the receptor. We observed that compounds with large achiral alicyclic side chains generally had good potency at NTS2 while linear or branched aliphatic chains were much weaker at NTS2 and showed partial agonist activity at NTS1 — . Unfortunately, compounds with large achiral alicyclic side chains were not selective for NTS2 as they also possess good NTS 1 antagonist activity. The data obtained for compounds 5a, 14b and 20b-23b in Table 2 illustrate the SAR typical of the large cyclic amino acid side chains. This group of compounds, each possessing the 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl ring and the 7-chloroquinoline group, demonstrated that large cyclic (cycloheptyl, 20b), large bicyclic (adamantyl, 5a), and large pendant alicyclic (14b) structures are potent NTS1 antagonists with Ke values of 42, 4.7 and 23 nM respectively. Compounds with smaller cyclic rings were somewhat less potent at NTS1, Ke = 222 nM for the five-membered cyclic ring (22b) and 157 nM for the six-membered cyclic ring (21b). According to these data then, the compounds with smaller cyclic rings (21b, 22b) trended toward NTS2 selectivity. Compounds 20b-22b also showed increased NTS2 agonist potency (lower ECso) but this was accompanied by full efficacy (high Emax relative to 5b) at NTS2, exactly opposite of that found in levocabastine (6). [00145] In their favor, however, these same compounds (20b-22b) showed improved binding affinity at NTS2 versus 14b (Ki = 170, 151 and 102 nM versus 644 nM for 14b), more in line with 5a (Ki = 62 nM). We found this binding affinity and potency improvement worked in concert with the lowered NTS1 activity observed for the compounds above that lacked the 2,6-dimethoxy substitution (15b- 18b). This provided enhanced NTS2 affinity and potency while maintaining low efficacy and lowered NTS 1 activity. A comparison of the data from the compound couple, 21b and 23b, to the data from the compound couple 14b and 17b illustrates this point. The 2-methoxyphenyl substituted compounds, 23b and 17b, showed NTS1 antagonist activity that was considerably lower than that found for the 2,6- dimethoxyphenyl substituted analogs 21b and 14b. The NTS2 potency (ECso) was either unchanged or improved and both sets showed an accompanying decrease in NTS2 efficacy (Emax). The observed improvement in NTS2 binding affinity for compound 23b versus 17b thus demonstrates the contribution of the amino acid side chain. [00146] This comparison of NTS2 agonist potency to the NTS1 antagonist potency for compounds 21b and 23b was an important clue to achieving selectivity in this series of compounds as this data reinforced the data from the previous series which showed that the NTS1 receptor relied much more heavily upon the 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl ring for its activity compared with NTS2 and that the amino acid side chain could work in concert with the methoxyphenyl ring to retain these desired properties. This trend was further advanced in compounds that did not possess the chloroquinoline group. In Table 3, two alternate substitutions for the chloroquinoline group, the napthyl (A) and 4-fluorophenyl (B) are depicted along with their associated data. These substitutions for the 7-chloroquinolyl group were included in our compound libraries during their synthesis because the napthyl compounds were known to yield NTS1 antagonists— and the 4-fluorophenyl group was found in levocabastine (6). [00147] Like their 7-chloroquinolyl counterparts, the napthyl-substituted 2,6- dimethoxyphenyl derivatives 24b and 26b possess potent NTS1 antagonist activity and also NTS2 agonist activity, however, distinct differences were found as well. Most notably, the Ke values for NTS1 antagonist activity and the NTS2 Emax values were roughly half of that found for similarly substituted chloroquinoline-based compounds. These compounds were inherently less potent at NTS1 and less efficacious at NTS2. This was observed for both the L-cyclohexyl glycine (24b) and the 1-aminocyclohexancarboxylic acid side chains (26b). Comparing the napthyl (24b) and the 7-chloroquinolyl (14b) compounds (Tables 2 and 3), we found Ke values of 58 versus 23 nM and NTS2 Emax values of 45 and 86% of 5b respectively. Comparing compounds 26b and 21b, we found Ke values of 230 versus 157 nM and NTS2 Emax values of 35 and 78% of 5b respectively. [00148] As expected from the 7-chloroquinolyl series, the napthyl-substituted 2- methoxyphenyl derivatives 25b and 27b were less potent NTS1 antagonists than their 2,6- dimethoxyphenyl substituted counterparts. More surprising was the observation that the NTS2 efficacies for these compounds were nearly half again as low as that found in similarly substituted 7-chloroquinolyl compounds 17b and 23b, a second example of cooperative behavior or SAR working in concert to provide additive results. This is readily revealed in a comparison of the NTS2 efficacy data obtained for the 2,6-dimethoxy, 7-chloroquinolyl compound 21b, the 2-methoxy 7-chloroquinolyl 23b and the 2-methoxy napthyl substituted compound 27b with NTS2 Emax values of 78, 35, and 18% of 5b respectively. [00149] There were also changes observed in the NTS2 ECso and binding affinity (Ki) data for the napthyl-substituted versus the 7-chloroquinolyl-substituted pyrazole compounds. Napthyl-substituted compounds, bearing the 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl ring were more potent than their chloroquinoline-based counterparts (14b, 17b, 21b and 23b) but, napthyl compounds bearing the 2-methoxyphenyl ring were equally potent. This was observed for compounds with the L-cyclohexyl glycine as well as those with 1- aminocyclohexancarboxylic acid as in 26b and 27b. The NTS2 binding data observed for the napthyl-substituted compounds 24b-27b was found to be in line with that seen for the similarly substituted 7-chloroquinolyl-substituted compounds with the 2-methoxy derivatives showing lower affinity (higher K; values) than the 2,6-dimethoxy counterparts. As before though, the compounds bearing the L-cyclohexyl glycine side chain (24b,25b) were less potent than those with the 1-aminocyclohexancarboxylic side chain (26b,27b). [00150] At the NTS2 receptor, the calcium data profile for compound 26b looked promising as it was found to be moving closer to levocabastine (6). Compound 26b showed two-fold greater NTS2 potency and comparable efficacy. The binding data was also similar but in this case, compound 6 was more potent showing a ¾ 3.5-fold greater than that for 26b. The similarity between these two compounds ended however when comparing receptor selectivity as compound 26b showed substantial NTSl antagonist activity while levocabastine (6) displayed no activity at NTSl. The 2-methoxy napthyl-substituted analog 27b was not able to compensate for this deficit for while its NTSl antagonist activity was lowered by twenty-fold, the NTS2 potency and binding affinity also suffered substantial losses. [00151] Compounds bearing a 4-fluorophenyl-substituent (30, 31, 28b, 29b, 7b) are shown in Table 3. Comparison of the adamantyl-substituted compounds 5a and 30 and 31 highlights the contribution of the 4-fluorophenyl ring. These data show that the NTSl antagonist activity was diminished by 40-fold for 30 versus 5a with Ke values of 191 and 4.7 nM respectively. The NTS2 potency, on the other hand, was doubled (EC50 values of 120 versus 68 nM) while the efficacy was less than half relative to 5a (Emax values of 100 versus 34% of 5b). This phenomenon was also observed in the data for compounds 28b, 29b and 7b. These compounds are all far less active at NTSl compared with their corresponding 7- chloroquinolyl (14b, 21b and 23b) or napthyl (24b, 26b and 27b) analogs and thereby attain enhanced NTS2 selectivity with respect to calcium release. The 4-fluorophenyl-substituted compounds (29b and 7b), bearing the 1-aminocyclohexancarboxylic acid substituent, showed the most levocabastine-like profiles whether they had a 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl ring (29b) or a 2-methoxyphenyl ring (7b). In keeping with previous observations, the transition to the 2- methoxyphenyl ring (7b) from the 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl ring (29b) led to a nearly 50% reduction in NTS2 efficacy with NTS2 Emax values of 15 and 8% of 5b respectively. [00152] Their NTS2 binding affinity was also consistent with similarly substituted 7- chloroquinolyl (21b, 23b) or napthyl-substituted (26b, 27b) analogs bearing the 1- aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid substitution with one important exception, the binding affinity did not decrease in going from the 2,6-dimethoxyphenyl (29b) to the 2- methoxyphenyl ring substitution (7b) with K; values of 140 and 153 nM respectively. We imagine that this change in SAR for 29b and 7b could result from a change in binding mode at NTS2 that is permitted for 4-fluorophenyl but not 7-chloroquinolyl or napthyl-substituted analogs. But whatever the reason, the 4-fluorophenyl-substitution was able to overcome the deficits found in both the 7-chloroquinolyl and napthyl-substituted analogs to provide pyrazole-based compounds (29b and 7b) with enhanced NTS2 potency and binding affinity with significantly lower efficacy compared to 5a at the NTS2 receptor. [00153] From the standpoint of calcium mobilization at NTS 1 and NTS2, compounds (29b and 7b) appear to be selective for the NTS2 receptor. However, we were not certain that this was a fair comparison as one assay measures calcium release (NTS2) and the other blockade of calcium release (NTSl). We therefore acquired the radioligand binding data for both 29b and 7b at NTSl in order to compare like measurements. As seen in Table 4, comparison of the relative binding affinities at NTSl and NTS2 showed that compound 7b is 161 -fold selective for NTS2 versus NTSl while the dimethoxy analog 29b shows a 23 -fold preference for NTS2 over NTSl. [00154] The identification of 7b and 31 as an NTS2 selective compounds demonstrated that this calcium assay was useful for driving SAR studies in the pyrazole carboxamide series of compounds. However the low efficacy of 7b, less than half of that found for levocabastine, prompted us to revisit mobilization of calcium release in the parent CHO cell line. We thus carried a final study and examined all of the compounds reported herein that showed NTS2 Emax values less than 15% of 5b. This was done collectively comparing all of the low efficacy compounds together in the same assay, under identical conditions, in our CHO-kl-NTS2 cells and simultaneously in the parent CHO line. The results of these experiments confirmed that the calcium mobilization observed was only found in the CHO cells stably expressing the NTS2 receptor. [00155] In summary, we have tested numerous analogs of 5a in a calcium mobilization assay and in comparison with binding affinity data and have determined that it correctly identifies compounds that are active at NTS2. In SAR studies with 5a we identified patterns of behavior for each of the appended molecular regions including the: the dimethoxyphenyl ring, the amino acid side chain, the 7-chloroquinoline ring, and the 4-position of the pyrazole ring. We found that changes to the 2,6-dimethoxyaryl ring significantly decreased NTSl activity and NTS2 efficacy of calcium release while leaving NTS2 potency and binding affinity little changed. Alkylation of the 4-position with an ethyl group provided data nearly indistinguishable from that obtained by changing substitution pattern of the 2,6- dimethoxyaryl ring. We found the amino acid side chain has a powerful influence on ligand affinity and potency at NTS2. Furthermore, the large cyclic or appended alicylic groups provided potent NTS1 compounds with full efficacy at NTS2 while smaller cyclic rings favored NTS2 over NTS 1 in potency and binding. We also established that the potency and affinity enhancement discovered with the smaller cyclic rings was preserved with a change from a 7-chloroquinolyl to 4-fluorphenyl group. This provided compounds with both lower NTS2 efficacy and enhanced NTS2 selectivity and led us to the discovery of 7b and 31, as pyrazole-based compounds with properties similar to levocabastine in this assay. [00156] Conclusions [00157] We have determined that the NTS2 mediated calcium release described by other researchers for SR48692 (5a) and SR142948 (5b) can be applied to the discovery of novel NTS2 active compounds. We have tested many of the compounds common to neurotensin research accordingly and have identified their associated calcium mobilization patterns in this assay. We found that compounds known to possess analgesic and anti-psychotic activity in vivo appear as antagonists (NT and NT(8-13)) or potent partial agonists (levocabastine). Using this NTS2 calcium mobilization assay as a guide to SAR, we have demonstrated that it is possible to lower the efficacy profile of 5a to produce compounds with in vitro profiles more closely aligned with levocabastine (6). Using this assay in combination with a FLIPR assay for NTS1, we were able to identify compounds 7b and 31 that are selective for NTS2 versus NTS1. Radioligand binding experiments carried out on the compounds described herein revealed a positive correlation between binding affinity at NTS2 versus 125I-NT and NTS2 mediated calcium mobilization. Comparison of the K; data obtained for 7b and 31 from both the NTS2 and NTS1 binding assays provided additional confirmation of their selectivity. [00158] We are currently working to correlate our in vitro results to specific actions in vivo using appropriate animal models. Additionally, compound 7b is being tested to determine if it is active as an HI antagonist like levocabastine. We recognized at the outset that identification of a pyrazole-based levocabastine-like compound would provide an opportunity to achieve selectivity versus the HI receptor since it lacks a basic amine, which is common to both the HI histamine pharmacophore and levocabastine (6).

MS (ESI) m/z: 436.7 (M-H+). Anal. [00223] Pharmalogical Methods. [00224] Calcium mobilization assay for NTS1 Receptor. CHO-kl-rNTSl cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin/ 100 ug/ml streptomycin, 100 ug/ml normocin (Invivogen), and 250 ug/ml geneticin. For calcium mobilization assays, cells were plated at 30,000 cells/well in black, clear-bottom 96-well plates 24hrs before the assay and incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2. Prior to the assay, Calcium 5 dye (Molecular Devices) was reconstituted according to manufacturer instructions. The reconstituted dye was diluted 1:40 in assay buffer (lx HBSS, 20mM HEPES, and 2.5mM Probenicid (Sigma), pH 7.4). Growth media was removed and 200ul of this diluted dye was added to each well. Plates were incubated for 45 min at 37°C, 5% CO2 after dye addition. For agonist assays, cells were pre-treated with 1:10 addition of 10% DMSO in assay buffer and the plates were returned to 37°C, 5% CO2 for 15 minutes. Full-log serial dilutions of the test compounds were made at 10X the desired final concentration in 1% DMSO assay buffer and warmed to 37°C. After the pre-treatment incubation, fluorescence intensity was measured on a FlexStation II fluorometric imaging plate reader (Molecular Devices). Relative fluorescence units (RFU) were measured before (20 readings) and after (40 readings) the agonist compound addition for a total 60 second read time (Excitation = 485nm, Emission = 525nm, cutoff = 515nm). For antagonist assays, cells were treated with Calcium dye for 45 min at 37°C, 5% CO2 as with the agonist assays. Then the test antagonist compounds were added in 1% DMSO in assay buffer and the plate was incubated for 15 min at 37°C, 5% CO2. Ke assays were run against dose-response curves of the control agonist NT and IC50 assays were run against 1 nM NT. [00225] Calcium mobilization assay for NTS2 Receptor. CHO-kl-rNTS2 cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% FBS, pen/strep, 100μg/ml normocin, and 400 μg/ml geneticin. For calcium mobilization assays, cells were plated at 25,000 cells/well in black, clear-bottom 96-well plates 24hrs before the assay and incubated at 37°C, 5% C02. 100 μΐ reconstituted Calcium 5 dye (Molecular Devices, diluted 1:20 in assay buffer (IX HBSS, 20 mM HEPES, 2.5 mM Probenicid, pH 7.4)) was added per well and plates were incubated for 45 min at 37°C, 5% CO2. For agonist assays, cells were pre-treated with 1:10 addition of 10% DMSO and the plates were returned to 37°C, 5% CO2. Full-log serial dilutions of the test compounds were made at 10X the desired final concentration in 1% DMSO assay buffer and warmed to 37°C. After the pre-treatment incubation, fluorescence intensity was measured on a FLIPR Tetra fluorometric imaging plate reader (Molecular Devices). Relative Fluorescence Units (RFUs) were measured every second for 100 seconds (14 readings before compound addition to establish baseline fluorescence, 85 after) Exposure time 0.53 s, Gain = 2000, Excitation intensity = 30%, Gate open = 10%. For antagonist assays, 1/10 volume of lOx concentration of the test compound dilutions in 10% DMSO in assay buffer was added to cells in lieu of the 10% DMSO only in assay buffer for the pre- treatment. Ke assays were run against dose-response curves of the control agonist 5b and IC50 assays were run against the ECso of 5b (73 nM final concentration). [00226] Competitive Binding Assays. Relative binding affinity was evaluated using 125I labeled neurotensin and CHO-kl cell lines over-expressing either the rNTSl or rNTS2 receptor essentially as described by Gendron— . Briefly, cells were plated at 100,000 cells/well in 24-well plates in complete DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units of penicillin/mL, 100 μg of streptomycin/mL, 0.1 mg/mL of normocin, and 250 μg/ rriL geneticin. Cells were incubated at 37°C with 5% C02 and 95% humidity for 48 hrs. Cells were then equilibrated for 10 minutes in Earle 's buffer (130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 0.1% glucose, and then incubated with or without 10 nM test compound in 0.1 nM 125I-NT at 37°C for 30 min. Cells were washed twice in Earle' s buffer, extracted in 1 ml 0.1N NaOH and counted in a Packard Cobra II Gamma Counter for 1 minute. Total binding was determined in the absence of test compound and non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1.0 μΜ non-radiolabeled neurotensin. [00227] Data Analysis. To determine EC50, IC50, and Ke values, data were fit to a three- parameter logistic equation using GraphPad Prism software. Ki values for radioligand binding assays were determined from IC50 values using the equation of Cheng and Prusoff. All data are from at least three independent experiments run in duplicate wells.
