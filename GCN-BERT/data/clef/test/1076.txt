CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application makes reference to and claims the benefit of the following co-pending U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 61/718,209, filed Oct. 25, 2012, and 61/757,871, filed Jan. 29, 2013. The entire disclosure and contents of the foregoing Provisional Applications are hereby incorporated by reference. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention broadly relates to fast dissolving edible solid nutritional supplement compositions comprising a calcium mineral source, an citric and malic acid component, and an edible carbon dioxide-generating bicarbonate component in an amount sufficient to aid in dispersing the calcium mineral source but without inhibiting the chelate complex formation between the calcium mineral source and the citric and malic acid component, each of the calcium mineral source, the citric and/or malic acid component and bicarbonate component having at about 90% particulates with a particle size of less than about 74 microns. The present invention also broadly relates to methods for making these compositions. BACKGROUND Mineral and vitamin supplements are recognized to be important for those who have inadequate diets, including and particularly women and children in order to alleviate the problem of improper diet, supplementation of such diets with certain minerals and vitamins, such as by the use of vitamin supplement pills, fortified foods (e.g., fortified beverages), other nutritional supplements, etc., may be required. Several minerals may be necessary for complete nutrition, and calcium is one of the most vital of these minerals. Calcium is the fifth most abundant element in the human body, and plays an important role, not only for bone building, but also in many physiological processes, including nerve and muscle functions, Calcium deficiency may interfere with muscular contraction and can also result in depletion of skeletal calcium. Osteoporosis is also a recognized nutritional problem, and numerous calcium fortified compositions are presently being marketed in an attempt to overcome this problem. Nutritional supplementation, especially fortification of foods such as beverages, with various minerals, such as calcium, may be difficult for many reasons. These minerals generally cause unacceptable taste qualities and importantly, may interact (e.g., react) with other components in such products, including other minerals, as well as any vitamins present. In fact, as the number and amount of these minerals (as well as vitamins) in such products increases, the problem of adverse interaction between these minerals (and vitamins present) likewise grows greater. For example, the mineral cations present in oxidative environments that often exist in such products may react, degrade, etc., thus depleting the amount of the bioavailable form of the mineral source present in the product, causing unacceptable taste, as well as undesirable discoloration and sedimentation issues in the product, etc. As a result, mineral (as well as vitamin) fortification of foods, such as in beverage products, for example, fruit juices and juice beverages which may contain many reactive components, may necessitate compromises in such fortification (e.g., such minerals, as well as vitamins, may only be present in minimal or trace amounts) to lessen the potential impact of such undesirable mineral (as well as vitamin) interactions in such reactive environments to avoid other impacts (e.g., undesirable taste, discoloration and sedimentation) on consumer acceptance of such products. For powdered beverages and dry mix delivery applications, such as a dissolvable tablet, the nutritional supplementation with calcium should rapidly dissolve without sediment or precipitating out of solution. U.S. Pat.

Besides increasing calcium solubilization, another benefit of calcium citrate malate is that this complex does not interfere, or at least does not interfere in a significant way with the bioavailability or absorption of other minerals, including trace minerals, for example, iron. For the purposes of the present invention, the term “citric and malic acid component” refers an acid component which comprises a mixture of citric acid and malic acid (e.g., in an amount of from about 95 to 100% by weight, such as from about 98 to 100% by weight). In addition to citric acid and malic acid, the citric and malic acid component may optionally comprise one or more edible carboxylic acids such as fumaric acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, malonic acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, aspartic acid, glutaconic acid, glutamic acid, phosphoric acid, etc., as well as any edible salts such of edible carboxylic acids (e.g., sodium salt, potassium salt, calcium salt, magnesium salt, etc) For the purposes of the present invention, the term “total acids” refers to the combined amount of citric acid and malic acids (plus any other optional edible carboxylic acids) which are present in the aqueous liquid. The amount of the citric and malic acid component is sufficient to provide a level of total acids of at least about 0.2% by weight when solubilized in the aqueous liquid, for example, from about 0.2 to about 0.7% by weight, such as from about 0.3 to about 0.5% by weight For the purposes of the present invention, the term “carbon dioxide-generating bicarbonate component” refers to a composition, compound, material, ingredient, etc., which comprise bicarbonates and are capable of generating carbon dioxide (gas) in an aqueous liquid in the presence of the citric and malic acid component.

Suitable amounts of the edible solid carbon dioxide-generating bicarbonate component may be, for example, in a weight ratio of the edible solid carbon dioxide-generating bicarbonate component to the citric and malic acid component of from about 1:1 to about 1:45, such as from about 1:1.1 to about 1:3. For the purposes of the present invention, the term “iron (11) mineral source” refers to any source of iron which may provide nutritional benefit, and which may exist in the divalent state (e.g., are “ferrous” compounds/salts) Suitable iron (II) mineral sources may include one or more of: ferrous bis-glycinate (Ferrochel), ferrous glycine sulfate (ferroglycine sulfate), ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous succinate, ferrous lactate, ferrous tartrate, ferrous citrate, ferrous sulfate, ferrous ammonium sulfate, ferrous iodide, etc. See U.S. Provisional Pat. Appln. Ser. No. 61/588,680, filed Jan. 20, 2012, the entire disclosure and contents of which is herein incorporated by reference. For the purposes of the present invention, the term “high ferric ion reducing agent” refers to an agent which measurably retards the tendency of ferrous cationic species to be oxidized (converted) to ferric cationic species (i.e., tends to reduce the ferric species and thus creates a high reducing potential environment for the ferrous species).

Appln. Ser. No. 61/588,680, filed Jan. 20, 2012, now claimed for priority benefit by PCT Appln. Serial No. PCT/US13/021526, filed Jan. 15, 2013, the entire disclosure and contents of both applications being herein incorporated by reference. For the purposes of the present invention, the term “binding agent” means various compounds, components, ingredients, substances, materials, layers, steps, etc., which provides tendency to bind together other components in the presence of moisture.

For the purposes of the present invention, the term “room temperature” refers to the commonly accepted meaning of room temperature, i.e., an ambient temperature of 20° to 25° C. For the purposes of the present invention, the terms “container” and “package” are used interchangeably and refer to a package or container that contains the embodiments of the edible solid nutritional composition of the present invention. The specific type of package or container, either of a single-serving size or any other size, used as a container for the embodiments of the edible solid nutritional composition of the present invention may depend on such factors as whether the composition is a tablet, powder, etc., whether the composition includes perishable components, whether the composition is sensitive to moisture, oxygen, etc. For the purposes of the present invention, the term “comprising” means various compounds, components, ingredients, substances, materials, layers, steps, etc., may be conjointly employed. Accordingly, the term “comprising” encompasses the more restrictive terms “consisting essentially of” and “consisting of.” Description Calcium fortification of foods and beverages may be difficult because of the poor solubility of certain calcium salts in solution. While dietary calcium supplements may provide important sources of calcium, such sources may need to be ingested with other foods or over time in multiple does, and may also have poor bioavailability due to slow dissolution in the stomach and poor solubility. When used in aqueous solutions, such as beverages, poor solubility of the calcium salts may not only cause precipitation in fortified products but also may also cause a chalky taste and undesirable aftertaste problems. The present invention broadly relates to relatively fast dissolving edible solid nutritional compositions which may create minimal or no precipitation when solubilized in aqueous liquids (e.g., water) which comprise a nutritionally supplemental amount of one or more calcium mineral sources and which may optionally include other micronutrient sources, vitamin D, ascorbic acid, iron, and magnesium. Besides the calcium mineral source, the edible solid nutritional composition comprises a citric and malic acid component in an amount sufficient to provide a level of total acids of at least about 0.2% by weight when solubilized in the aqueous liquid. This edible solid nutritional composition also comprises an edible solid carbon dioxide-generating bicarbonate component having at least about 90% particulates (such as at least about 95% particulates) with a particle size of less than about 74 microns and in an amount sufficient to aid in dispersing the calcium mineral source in the aqueous liquid, but without significantly inhibiting the chelate complex formation between the calcium mineral source and the citric and malic acid component in the aqueous liquid. These edible solid nutritional compositions provide fast dissolution of the calcium through an acid solubilized chelate complex but without the need of hand or mechanical stirring. Embodiments of the edible solid nutritional compositions of the present invention (e.g., tablets, powders, granules, etc) permit the formation of more bioavailable calcium mineral sources in-situ when added to an aqueous solution or beverage due the creation of a chelate complex between the calcium mineral source, such as a calcium hydroxide (hydrate), and the citric and malic acid component, such as a citric acid and malic acid component. For example, the chelated complex calcium citrate malate (CCM), a highly soluble calcium source, disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,722,847 (Heckert), issued Feb. 2, 1988, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,375 (Nakel et al.), issued Apr. 12, 1988 (the entire disclosures and contents of which are herein incorporated by reference) may be formed by using embodiments of the edible solid nutritional compositions of the present invention. Rapid chelate complex formation is aided by the presence of the edible solid carbon dioxide-generating bicarbonate component, such as sodium bicarbonate or potassium bicarbonate, which generates bubbling, agitation, mixing, stirring, etc., in the aqueous liquid to which the edible solid nutritional composition is added. In addition, each of the calcium mineral source, the citric and/or malic acid component and the edible solid carbon dioxide-generating bicarbonate component have a specified particle size, i.e., at least about 90% particulates with a particle size of less than about 74 microns. In some embodiments, the calcium mineral source and the edible solid carbon dioxide-generating bicarbonate component may comprise at least about 95% particulates with a particle size of less than about 74 microns. In other embodiments, the calcium mineral source and the edible solid carbon dioxide-generating bicarbonate component may comprise at least about 75% particulates (such as at least about 80%) with a particle size of less than about 44 microns. Reducing the particle size of the particulates present in the calcium mineral source, as well as the citric and/or malic acid component and edible solid carbon dioxide-generating bicarbonate component, to less than about 74 microns avoids or minimizes interference with the calcium chelate complex formations, as well as resulting in little to no precipitation when the edible solid nutritional composition is added to an aqueous liquid media. In particular, the use of such particle size distribution in the embodiments of the edible solid nutritional composition avoids or minimizes slow dissolution of the calcium mineral source and the edible solid carbon dioxide-generating bicarbonate component (e.g., sodium bicarbonate) particles that may result in insoluble calcium precipitates and chalky taste residues. In embodiments of the edible solid nutritional composition of the present invention, the edible solid carbon dioxide-generating bicarbonate component is present in amounts sufficient to aid in dispersing the calcium mineral source in the aqueous liquid but without significantly inhibiting the chelate complex formation between the calcium mineral source and the citric and malic acid component in the aqueous liquid. In some embodiments, the edible solid carbon dioxide-generating bicarbonate component (e.g., sodium bicarbonate) may be present, for example, in an amount of at least about 6% by weight (for example, at least about 10% by weight) of the nutritional composition, such as at least about 13% by weight of the nutritional composition, e.g., from about 13% to about 20% by weight of the nutritional composition, or at least about 15% by weight of the nutritional composition, e.g., from about 17% to about 25% by weight of the nutritional composition. The calcium mineral source is present in a nutritionally supplemental amount in embodiments of the edible solid nutritional composition of the present invention, and may be a highly bioavailable form resulting from a solubilized calcium complex with the citric and malic acid component (e.g., a solubilized calcium citrate malate chelate complex). The calcium mineral source, for example, calcium hydroxide (hydrate), may be present in an amount of at least about 5% by weight (e.g., at least about 6% by weight) of the edible solid nutritional composition, such as up to about 28% by weight of the nutritional composition, e.g., from about 5% to about 28% by weight (such as from about 6% to about 28% by weight) of the nutritional composition. The amount of the solubilized calcium in the resulting ingestible (e.g., drinkable) beverage (i.e., after adding to edible solid nutritional composition to an aqueous liquid) may be, for example, in an amount sufficient to provide at least about 0.04% solubilized calcium by weight of the resulting liquid nutritional composition (e.g., ingestible beverage), such as at least about 0.12% by weight of the resulting ingestible beverage, e.g., a one serving size beverage. For example, the amount of calcium may be in an amount sufficient to provide from about 0.04% to about 0.21% solubilized calcium by weight of the resulting ingestible beverage. The amount of the calcium mineral source present in the final ingested product may provide at least about 10% of the RDA of calcium per serving, such as at least about 30% of the RDA of calcium per serving. In embodiments of the edible solid nutritional composition of the present invention, the citric and malic acid component is present in amounts which provide a level of total acids of greater than about 0.2% by weight (for example, from about 0,2 to about 0,7% by weight, such as from about 0.3 to about 0.5% by weight) when solubilized in the aqueous liquid. For example, in some embodiments the citric and malic acid component may be present in an amount of at least about of at least about 20% by weight of the nutritional composition, such as from about 20% to about 55% by weight of the nutritional composition, e.g., from about 35% to about 40% by weight of the nutritional composition. In some embodiments of the citric and malic acid component, the amount, respectively, of citric acid may be in the range of from about 11% to about 32% by weight of the nutritional composition, while the amount of malic acid may be, for example, in the range of from about 9% to about 23% by weight of the nutritional composition. In some embodiments of the citric malic acid component, the citric acid and malic acid may be in a weight ratio of from about 4:1 to about 1:2, such as from about 3:1 to about 1:1, e.g., a weight ratio of citric acid to malic acid of about 5:2. While the citric and malic acid component is included in the edible solid nutritional composition of the present invention to solubilize the calcium mineral source, the citric and malic acid present in this component additionally react with the edible solid carbon dioxide-generating bicarbonate component (e.g., sodium bicarbonate) to generate carbon dioxide gas and thus provide bubbling, agitation, mixing, stirring, etc, to increase solubilization of other components present in the edible solid nutritional composition in the aqueous liquid The effectiveness of this solubilization in increased when either the citric acid or malic acid or combinations thereof has a specified particle size, i.e., at least about 90% particulates with a particle size of less than about 74 microns. Embodiments of the edible solid nutritional composition of the present invention may optionally include other highly soluble mineral sources. In some embodiments, iron (II) mineral sources, such as ferrous bis-glycinate (an amino-acid chelated iron (II) source), may be included to provide iron mineral nutritional supplementation. For example, the iron (II) mineral source may be present in the composition in an amount of from about 0.06% to about 0.20% (iron metal basis), such as from about 0.06% to about 0.15%. The iron (II) mineral source may be present in the composition in an amount sufficient to provide in the final product at least about 10% of the RDA of iron, such as from about 10 to about 30% of the RDA of iron, e.g., from about 10 to about 25% of the RDA of iron. See U.S. Provisional Pat. Appln. Ser. No. 61/588,680, filed Jan. 20, 2012, the entire disclosure and contents of which is herein incorporated by reference. Embodiments of the edible solid nutritional composition of the present invention may optionally include high ferric ion reducing agents, such as, for example, ascorbic acid, edible ascorbic acid salts, edible ascorbic acid esters, erythorbic acid, edible erythorbic acid salts, or edible erythorbic acid esters. These high ferric ion reducing agents may be present in these nutritional compositions in an amount sufficient to measurably retard conversion of the iron (II) mineral sources from ferrous to ferric species. The ascorbic acid, edible ascorbic acid salts and/or edible ascorbic acid esters may be present, for example, in an amount of at least about 0.035% by weight of the nutritional composition, such as at least about 0.08% by weight of the composition or product.
