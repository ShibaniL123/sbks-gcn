METHOD FOR THE ISOMERIZATION OF GLUCOSE TO FRUCTOSE CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION [0001] This application claims the benefit of priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 61/989,181, filed May 6, 2014, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. Government Grant Support [0002] This invention was made with the support of the National Science Foundation under grant number EEC-0813570. The Government has certain rights in the invention. Background of the Invention [0003] The isomerization of sugars is a key reaction used in various industrial processes. For instance, the conversion of glucose into fructose for the production of high- fructose corn syrups (HFCS) has become the largest immobilized biocatalytic process worldwide. HFCS has reached a global production exceeding 8 x 106 tons/year (in the United States alone, per capita consumption of HFCS reached 37.8 lbs/year in 2008). See, for example, S. Bhosale et al, Microbial. Rev., 60, 280 (1996); J. Lecomte et al, Starch-Starke, 54. 75 (2002). In addition, the recent drive to use biomass as an alternative to petroleum for the production of fuels and chemical intermediates has triggered a renewed interest in carbohydrate chemistry. See, Y. Roman- Leshkov et al., Nature, 447, 982 (2007); M. Climent et al, Green Chem., 13, 520 (2011). The reaction pathway is shown in Scheme 1 , below. [0004] Scheme 1. Schematic representation of the glucose isomerization reaction pathways catalyzed by either biological or chemical catalysts. Byproducts ) Mannose (a-pyranose form) [0005] In industry, this reaction is typically catalyzed enzymatically using immobilized xylose isomerase. The highest yields of fructose reported are in the order of 42%, which is close to the thermodynamic limit for this reaction. While the enzymatic process is highly selective, it suffers major drawbacks. In particular, the reaction temperature and the pH need to be carefully controlled to assure an optimal enzymatic activity. In addition, the reaction is slow and the maximum yield of 42% typically requires about 16 to 24 hours (M. Mo liner et al, PNAS. 107, 6164 (2010)). [0006] Many research groups have recently synthesized inorganic chemical catalysts to convert glucose obtained from lignocellulosic biomass into chemicals in an integrated process. Because of its poor reactivity, glucose must first be isomerized into fructose before the fructose is converted into platform chemicals such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). The best catalysts reported so far are combinations of Lewis and Br0nsted acids, either homogeneous and/or heterogeneous. Most catalysts transform glucose into HMF in a one-pot reaction, using a bi-phasic reactor. HMF is valuable for the production of furanics such as 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid, 2,5-bishydroxymethylfuran, 2,5- dimethylfuran, as well as organic acids such as levulinic acid. However, it would also be valuable to selectively form fructose for (i) the high fructose corn syrup industry, and (ii) to produce renewable chemicals through reaction paths that do not involve HMF as an intermediate, for example for the conversion of fructose to lactic acid. The typical reaction kinetics obtained with the xylose isomerase do not allow the integration of other chemical catalytic processes downstream. [0007] It has been known since 1895 that Br0nsted bases catalyze the isomerization of glucose to fructose. However, most groups who worked on this reaction reported very low fructose yields, in the order of 8 to 10%. These poor results are mainly due to the degradation of the sugars under strongly basic conditions. More recently, several groups have tested weak solid bases, in particular clays, metallosilicates, and other transition metal oxides. Relatively high yields of fructose were obtained, in the order of 25 to 30%. However, all these solid bases are unstable under the reaction conditions employed and dissolve during the first catalytic run. Therefore, solid bases do not present any significant advantage over homogeneous catalysts. [0008] Historically, the Lewis acids have received more attention due to the reportedly poor selectivity and yield of the bases. See, e.g., Y. Roman- Leshkov, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 49, 8954 (2010). Mark Davis at the California Institute of Technology reported the first heterogeneous Lewis acid catalyst that can isomerize glucose to fructose with 31% yield within 30 minutes. Davis et al. employed a Tin-doped BETA zeolite catalyst (Sn-Beta) using a multistep procedure requiring expensive chemicals and a synthesis time of more than 40 days. See M. Moliner et al. and Y. Roman-Leshkov et al., cited supra, and E. Nikolla et al., ACS Catal. 1, 408 (2011). [0009] Therefore, a need exists for improved methods to isomerize glucose to fructose. Summary of the Invention [0010] In various embodiments, the present invention provides a method including catalyzing the isomerization of glucose to fructose. The catalytic reaction (e.g., the catalyzing) includes combining an effective catalytic amount of an organic aliphatic amine or organic heterocyclic amine with glucose in an aqueous medium. The combining of the organic aliphatic amine or organic heterocyclic amine with the glucose isomerizes the glucose to yield a mixture that includes fructose and glucose. [0011] In various embodiments, the present invention provides methods including catalyzing the isomerization of glucose to fructose. The catalytic reaction (e.g., the catalyzing) includes combining an effective catalytic amount of a tri(Ci-Cio)alkylamine with glucose in an aqueous medium. Each of the (Ci- Cio)alkyl groups is independently selected. The aqueous medium is heated to about 50-150째C. The combining of the organic aliphatic amine or organic heterocyclic amine with the glucose isomerizes the glucose to yield a mixture that includes fructose and glucose. The yield of the fructose is about 20-50%. The glucose is isomerized to the fructose with about 40-80% selectivity. [0012] The present invention provides a method to isomerize glucose to fructose employing organic base(s) to catalyze the isomerization in an aqueous medium, such as water. The isomerization proceeds under mild reaction conditions (e.g., about 50-150째C, or about 70-120째C, such as for about 30 minutes or less). Reaction times can be about 1 minute to about 2.0 hours, such as from about 2 minutes to about 30 minutes, about 2 minutes to about 10 minutes, or about 5 minutes to about 9 minutes, or about 7 minutes, to afford high yields of fructose (e.g., 20-50%, 20-30%, or at least about 25%, e.g., about 30-50% yields, or about 20%, 21 , 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 , 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41 , 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or about 50% or more), while retaining high glucose conversion (e.g., about 25-85%, or about 25%, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, or about 85%) and high selectivity for fructose (e.g., about 40-80%, about 40-70%, or about 40%, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54, 56, 58, 60, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 78, or about 80% or more). The isomerization can be carried out under an inert atmosphere (e.g., substantially inert), such as under argon, to exclude CO2. The isomerization can otherwise be carried out under ambient conditions. During the isomerizing the aqueous medium can have any suitable pH, such as about 9 to about 14, or about 10 to about 12, or about 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 10.6, 10.7, 10.8, 10.9, 11, 11.1 , 11.2, 11.3, 11.4, 11.5, 12, 12.5, 13, 13.5, or about 14 or more, wherein in various embodiments, the aqueous medium can have the pH at the time of addition of the glucose to the aqueous medium. In various embodiments, the produced fructose can be removed from the system immediately after formation or shortly after formation to help avoid degradation. [0013] A wide variety of aliphatic, heterocyclic and heteroaromatic amines can be employed in effective catalytic amounts of about 2-35 mol-%, such as about 5-30 mol-% of the amount of glucose. Tertiary aliphatic amines, such as tris(lower afkyl) amines, e.g., tris(Ci-C4)alkyl amines, can be used. Primary and secondary amines also cause the undesired Maillard reaction, which deactivates them. The isomerization reaction can be carried out in aqueous solutions comprising about 2-50 wt-% glucose, e.g., about 5-40 wt-%, 5-20 wt- %, or about 5-15 wt-% (e.g., about 2 wt-% glucose, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, or about 50 wt-% or more glucose), such as with agitation such as stirring. Heat is applied, e.g., externally. High pressures are not required. The selectivity and percent conversion to fructose can be measured by methods known to the art. See, e.g., S. Yu et al., Catal. Commun., 29, 63 (2012)(HPLC); UPLC, see below, and M. Moliner et al., PNAS. 107. 6164 (2010). [0014] The mol-% of amine catalyst to glucose is about 2-30 mol-% (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or 30), such as about 5-20 mol-%, or about 7.5-12.5 mol- % (e.g., about 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11 , 11.5, 12, or about 12.5). [0015] The glucose can be obtained from carbohydrate components of biomass, such as starch or cellulose. [0016] The fructose can be recovered and converted to other useful chemicals, such as HMF. Brief Description of the Figures [0017] FIG. 1 is a graph depicting the conversion, selectivity, yield, and pKa for the isomerization of glucose (10 wt-% in water) to fructose using six organic amine catalysts at a loading of 10 mol-% of the glucose, using a reaction time of 30 minutes at 100째C, in accordance with various embodiments. [0018] FIG. 2 is a graph comparing the percent conversion of glucose, and the selectivity and yield of fructose when glucose is isomerized using triethyl amine as the catalyst under the conditions of FIG. 1 , in accordance with various embodiments.

[0025] A wide variety of aliphatic amines, heterocyclic amines and heteroaryl amines can be employed in the present method, and can be selected to be non-toxic, sufficiently basic and water soluble. Aliphatic and heterocyclic amines can be as catalysts, and mixtures of two or more of the organic amines found to be effective singly, can be employed. [0026] Broadly defined, useful organic amines include compounds of the structure N(Ra)(Rb)(Rc), wherein each of Ra, Rb and Rc is independently H, (Ci- C6)afkyl, (C3-C6)cycloafkyl, (C6-Cio)aryl, heteroaryl, or heterocyclyl; or Ra and Rb together with the nitrogen to which they are attached form a heterocyclic ring or a heteroaromatic ring; with the proviso that at least one of Ra, Rb or Rc is not hydrogen. [0027] The term "aryl" as used herein refers to cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon groups that do not contain heteroatoms in the ring. Thus aryl groups include, but are not limited to, phenyl, azulenyl, heptalenyl, biphenyl, indacenyl, fluorenyl, phenanthrenyl, triphenylenyl, pyrenyl, naphthacenyl, chrysenyl, biphenylenyl, anthracenyl, and naphthyl groups. In some embodiments, aryl groups contain about 6 to about 14 carbons in the ring portions of the groups. Aryl groups can be unsubstituted or substituted, as defined herein. Representative substituted aryl groups can be mono-substituted or substituted more than once, such as, but not limited to, a phenyl group substituted at any one or more of 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, or 6-positions of the phenyl ring, or a naphthyl group substituted at any one or more of 2- to 8-positions thereof. [0028] The terms "heteroaryl" and "heterocyclyl" refer to a monovalent heteroaromatic ring or heterocyclic ring. A heterocyclic ring encompasses a monocyclic, bicyclic, or tricyclic ring system containing a total of 3-20 atoms, including at least one N(H) moiety and one or more (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) carbon atoms, and optionally, one or more (e.g., 1 , 2, 3, or 4) heteroatoms selected from oxygen, sulfur, and N(X) wherein X is absent or is H, O, (Ci- Cz afkyl, phenyl or benzyl, wherein one or more ring carbons of the heterocyclic ring can optionally be substituted with oxo (=0). [0029] A heteroaromatic ring encompasses a monocyclic aromatic ring containing five or six ring atoms consisting of carbon and one to four heteroatoms each selected from the group consisting of non-peroxide oxygen, sulfur, and N(X) wherein X is absent or is H, O, (Ci-Cz alkyl, phenyl or benzyl, as well as a monovalent ortho-fused bicyclic heterocycle of about eight to ten ring atoms derived therefrom, particularly a benz-derivative or one derived by fusing a propylene, trimethylene, or tetramethylene substituent thereto.

[0031] Any aryl, heteroaryl, aromatic ring or heterocyclic ring may optionally be substituted with one or more substituents selected from the group consisting of halo, hydroxy, (Ci-C6)alkyl, (C3-C6)cycloalkyl, (Ci-C6)alkoxy, (C3- C6)cycloalkyloxy, (Ci-C6)alkanoyl, (Ci-C6)alkanoyloxy, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethoxy, nitro, cyano, and amino. [0032] In various embodiments, the catalyst can be a (Ci-Ce)3N or 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic rings comprising 1 or 2 N(X) wherein at least one X is H. In various embodiments, the amine can be a tertiary amine such as a tris(aliphatic) amine. Suitable amines can include triethylamine (TEA), pyrrolidine, piperidine, piperazine and morpholine. [0033] As used herein the term "aqueous medium" refers to water that may contain up to about 50 vol% of co-solvents (e.g., DMSO or an alcohol), surfactants, pH-adjusting agents, stabilizers and the like for the catalyst(s), the glucose or the fructose. Example I. [0034] In all of the examples listed on Tables 1, 2 and 3, a 10 wt-% glucose solution in water was inserted into 5ml glass vials, with disposable plastic Teflon lined screw caps (Chemglass Life Sciences NJ, USA). The solution was measured and transferred using an electronic pipet (Repeater Stream, Eppendorf NY, USA). [0035] Homogeneous organic or inorganic bases triethylamine (>99% Sigma- Aldrich MO, USA) (TEA), pyridine (99.8% Sigma- Aldrich MO, USA), pyrrolidine (99.5% Sigma-Aldrich MO, USA), piperazine (99% Sigma-Aldrich MO, USA), sodium Hydroxide (99.2% Fisher Scientific MA, USA), morpholine (>99% Sigma-Aldrich MO, USA), or piperidine (99% Sigma-Aldrich MO, USA), were loaded at 2, 5, 10, 20, 30 mol% in respect to glucose molar concentration. The reaction vials were then sealed and heated using a stirring/heating plate (RCT Basic, IKA Lab Technologies NC, USA) equipped with a 21-well heating block (Chemglass Life Sciences NJ, USA). A stirring rate of 500 rpm was used to promote mass transfer during reaction. A small amount of silicon oil was deposited in each well to minimize the heat transfer limitation from the heating block to the reaction vials. [0036] The vials were quenched in an ice bath after the desired reaction time was reached. A 0.5ml aliquot was taken from each vial for analysis. A dilution of 1 :20 was then made by combining the aliquot and 50/50 water/acetonitrile diluent. The conversion of glucose and generation of fructose was measured using an ultra performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector-evaporative light scattering detector system (UPLC-PDA-ELSD) (Waters MA, USA), equipped with a Waters UPLC column (Acquity UPLC BEH Amide 1.7 關菅管, 2.1 x 100mm). Data was collected and analyzed using Waters Empower 3 Software. [0037] Table 1.

FIG. 2 is a graph comparing the selectivity, conversion and yield attained with triethylamine used as the catalyst in the examples of Table 1 with the Sn-Beta zeolite catalysis of the Davis group. See, e.g., M. Mo liner et al., PNAS, 107, 6164 (2010) wherein a 10 wt-% glucose solution was isomerized with Sn-Beta (1 :50 Sn-glucose molar ratio) to yield a product that was 46 mol-% glucose, 31 mol-% fructose and 9 mol-% mannose after 30 minutes at 110째C. [0039] Table 2 provides catalytic results using 10 mol-% loading of amine catalyst relative to glucose [10 wt-% in water] for 30 minutes at 100째C showing glucose conversion, fructose selectivity, fructose yield and mannose yield.

[0041] The data shown in Tables 1 and 2 clearly show that organic amines, and in particular triethylamine, isomerize glucose to fructose with similar selectivity (56%) and yield (28%) as Sn-Beta. See M. Moliner et al, cited supra. Differences in performance were observed for the tested amines. Glucose conversion increased with pKa, however no correlation was found between pKa and both selectivity and yield of fructose. [0042] The Maillard reaction represents one possible pathway of byproduct formation. It is well-known in food sciences that primary and secondary amines react with reducible sugars through the Maillard reaction to form colored products. J.S. Kim et al. Food Chem.. 108. 582 (2008). The kinetics involved in this non-enzymatic browning reaction are complex and vary with the structure of the amine. The Maillard reaction is significantly faster in the presence of primary amines than with secondary amines, which is consistent with the darker solution observed for ethylenediamine compared to piperidine. Tertiary amines are not expected to participate in the Maillard reaction based on the proposed reaction mechanism. See, P.P. Wirth et al, J. Pharm. Scl, 87, 31 (1998). [0043] The Maillard reaction is particularly undesired in the present work as this stoichiometric reaction would consume both the reactant and the catalyst. Therefore, the isomerized solutions were analyzed using UV-vis spectrometry and lH NMR spectroscopy to elucidate the contribution from the Maillard reaction under the tested conditions. UV-vis spectra of the reacted solutions containing primary and secondary amines were red shifted relative to the spectrum of triethylamine. The magnitude of the shift was consistent with the expected kinetics: 42 nm for ethylenediamine (primary amine) and 2-14 nm for the secondary amines. The similarities between the UV-vis spectra of secondary and tertiary amines suggest that most colored byproducts observed with secondary amines are the result of thermal degradation of the carbohydrates, which is the process involved in caramelization. lH NMR investigations further confirmed that triethylamine does not participate in the Maillard reaction and is not consumed under reaction conditions. [0044] The effect of temperature, reaction time, and catalyst loading were further investigated for triethylamine (Table 3). Selectivity to fructose decreased with increasing catalyst concentration and/or reaction temperature. Our results indicate that a yield of 27-32% can be obtained for a wide range of reaction conditions, making it a rather flexible process. [0045] Table 3.

The undesired colored byproducts could be removed by simple purification using activated carbon. The solution was mixed after reaction (Table 3, Entry 10) with 5 wt.% of Darco짰 KB-G activated carbon and stirred for 1 h. The mixture was then filtered and analyzed by UV-Vis spectroscopy, UPLC, and lH NMR. The solution became colorless after filtration indicating that the colored byproducts adsorbed on the activated carbon. [0047] Analysis of the purified solution by UPLC indicated that the glucose and fructose concentrations remained unchanged, meaning that the activated carbon removed the undesired colored compounds selectively. Other byproducts were not detected by 쩐 NMR. Glucose, fructose, and triethylamine can be further separated by chromatography, using a similar technique as in industry to collect the fructose-rich stream (HFCS) and return the glucose- and triethylamine-rich streams to the reaction vessel. See, Rajabbeigi et al., Chem. Eng. ScL. 116. 235 (2014). [0048] In various embodiments, the present invention provides a method to use amines to catalyze the isomerization of glucose to fructose with the same performance as state-of-the-art Lewis acid catalysts. In various embodiments, the present method employing readily available organic amine bases provides at least comparable yields and improved selectivity over Sn-Beta catalyst system when run under equivalent conditions. A yield of 32% with a selectivity to fructose of 64% were reached after 7 min at 100 째C (Table 3). Triethylamine offers several additional advantages compared to Lewis acids. First, TEA is commercially available with >99.5% purity at a low cost, $3-12/kg for bulk orders. In addition, TEA is industrially produced from renewables by alkylation of ammonia with bioethanol. Finally, TEA has a relatively low toxicity and photochemically degrades within 90-240 minutes. See, e.g., BASF - The Chemical Company.
