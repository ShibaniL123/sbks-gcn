Intermediate 62: 8-Bromo-2-cyclopropyl-3-fluoro-7-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidine
To a solution of 8-bromo-2-cyclopropyl-7-(trifluoromethyl)imidazo[1,2-c]pyrimidine (Intermediate 49, 63 mg, 0.23 mmol) in ACN (3.0 mL) was added Selectfluor® (80 mg, 0.23 mmol) and the mixture was stirred at rt for 1 h. The crude mixture was concentrated to dryness, diluted with water, and extracted with DCM (×2). The combined organics were washed with brine, dried (Na2SO4), and filtered. The crude reaction mixture was purified (FCC, SiO2; 0-50% EtOAc/hexanes) to afford the title compound as white solid (30.5 mg, 46% yield).
