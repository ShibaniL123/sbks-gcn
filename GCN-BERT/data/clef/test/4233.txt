[4] Synthesis of N4-acetyl-5'-O-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-2'-O-(2-cyanoethoxymethoxymethyl)cytidine 3'-O-(2-cyanoethyl N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidite) (I-1)
N4-acetyl-5'-O-(4,4'-dimethoxytrityl)-2'-O-(2-cyanoethoxymethoxymethyl)cytidine (1d) (23 g, 31 mmol) was azeotropically distilled with acetonitrile, and dried in vacuo. This operation was performed twice. Under an argon atmosphere, diisopropylammoniumtetrazolide (6.5 g, 38 mmol) and acetonitrile (80 mL) were added, 2-cyanoethyl-N,N,N',N'-tetraisopropylphosphordiamidite (12 mL, 38 mmol) was further added, and the mixture was stirred at 40Â° C. for 3 hr. After completion of the reaction, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. Ethyl acetate was added and the mixture was washed once with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and once with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. The organic layer after washing was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The obtained crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexane:acetone=2:1, containing 0.1% triethylamine) to give the object compound (I-1) (25 g, purity 98.8%, yield 88%). The instrumental analytical values of compound (I-1) are shown below.
