Step 2: Preparation of 5-(benzyloxy)-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-methyl-1H-indole
In a 100 mL round bottom flask, 2-bromo-1-(4-fluorophenyl) propan-1-one (2.0 g, 8.66 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and triethylamine (2 mL) were dissolved in N, N-dimethylformamide (20 mL) at room temperature. Then 4-(benzyloxy) aniline (2.6 g, 13.05 mmol, 1.5 equiv) was added. The resulting solution was stirred for 16 hours at 125° C. in an oil bath. The mixtrue was cooled to room temperature and was quenched by the addition of AcOH (5%, 50 mL). The resulting mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL×2) and the organic layers were combined, washed with brine and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residue was applied onto a silica gel column eluting with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (v:v=1: 10). This resulted in 1.2 g (42%) of 5-(benzyloxy)-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-methyl-1H-indole as a yellow solid.
