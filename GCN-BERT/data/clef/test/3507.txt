This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/980,111, filed Apr. 16, 2014, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. 1. FIELD Provided herein are solid forms comprising 1-ethyl-7-(2-methyl-6-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-3,4-dihydropyrazino[2,3-b]pyrazin-2(1H)-one and a coformer. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising such solid forms (e.g., cocrystals) and methods of use for treating, preventing, and managing various disorders are also provided herein. 2. BACKGROUND The identification and selection of a solid form of a pharmaceutical compound is complex, given that a change in a solid form may affect a variety of physical and chemical properties, which may provide benefits or drawbacks in processing, formulation, stability and bioavailability, among other important pharmaceutical characteristics. Potential pharmaceutical solids include crystalline solids and amorphous solids. Amorphous solids are characterized by a lack of long-range structural order, whereas crystalline solids are characterized by structural periodicity. The desired class of pharmaceutical solid depends upon the specific application; amorphous solids are sometimes selected on the basis of, e.g., an enhanced dissolution profile, while crystalline solids may be desirable for properties such as, e.g., physical or chemical stability (see, e.g., S. R. Vippagunta et al., Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev., (2001) 48:3-26; L. Yu, Adv. Drug. Deliv. Rev., (2001) 48:27-42). Whether crystalline or amorphous, potential solid forms of a pharmaceutical compound include single-component and multiple-component solids. Single-component solids consist essentially of the pharmaceutical compound in the absence of other compounds. Variety among single-component crystalline materials may potentially arise from the phenomenon of polymorphism, wherein multiple three-dimensional arrangements exist for a particular pharmaceutical compound (see, e.g., S. R. Byrn et al., Solid State Chemistry of Drugs, (1999) SSCI, West Lafayette). The importance of discovering polymorphs was underscored by the case of Ritonavir, an HIV protease inhibitor that was formulated as soft gelatin capsules. About two years after the product was launched, the unanticipated precipitation of a new, less soluble polymorph in the formulation necessitated the withdrawal of the product from the market until a more consistent formulation could be developed (see S. R. Chemburkar et al., Org. Process Res. Dev., (2000) 4:413-417). Additional diversity among the potential solid forms of a pharmaceutical compound may arise from the possibility of multiple-component solids. Crystalline solids comprising two or more ionic species are termed salts (see, e.g., Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use, P. H. Stahl and C. G. Wermuth, Eds., (2002), Wiley, Weinheim). Additional types of multiple-component solids that may potentially offer other property improvements for a pharmaceutical compound or salt thereof include, e.g., hydrates, solvates, cocrystals and clathrates, among others (see, e.g., S. R. Byrn et al., Solid State Chemistry of Drugs, (1999) SSCI, West Lafayette). Moreover, multiple-component crystal forms may potentially be susceptible to polymorphism, wherein a given multiple-component composition may exist in more than one three-dimensional crystalline arrangement. The discovery of solid forms is of great importance in the development of a safe, effective, stable and marketable pharmaceutical compound. Notably, it is not possible to predict a priori if crystalline forms of a compound even exist, let alone how to successfully prepare them (see, e.g., Braga and Grepioni, 2005, “Making crystals from crystals: a green route to crystal engineering and polymorphism,” Chem. Commun.:3635-3645 (with respect to crystal engineering, if instructions are not very precise and/or if other external factors affect the process, the result can be unpredictable); Jones et al., 2006, Pharmaceutical Cocrystals: An Emerging Approach to Physical Property Enhancement,” MRS Bulletin 31:875-879 (At present it is not generally possible to computationally predict the number of observable polymorphs of even the simplest molecules); Price, 2004, “The computational prediction of pharmaceutical crystal structures and polymorphism,” Advanced Drug Deliver Reviews 56:301-319 (“Price”); and Bernstein, 2004, “Crystal Structure Prediction and Polymorphism,” ACA Transactions 39:14-23 (a great deal still needs to be learned and done before one can state with any degree of confidence the ability to predict a crystal structure, much less polymorphic forms)). Cocrystals are crystalline molecular complexes of two or more non-volatile compounds bound together in a crystal lattice by non-ionic interactions. Pharmaceutical cocrystals are cocrystals of a therapeutic compound, e.g., an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), and one or more non-volatile compound(s) (referred to herein as coformer). A coformer in a pharmaceutical cocrystal is typically selected from non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable molecules, such as, for example, food additives, preservatives, pharmaceutical excipients, or other APIs. In recent years, pharmaceutical cocrystals have emerged as a possible alternative approach to enhance physicochemical properties of drug products. The variety of possible solid forms creates potential diversity in physical and chemical properties for a given pharmaceutical compound. The compound chemically named 1-ethyl-7-(2-methyl-6-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-3,4-dihydropyrazino[2,3-b]pyrazin-2(1H)-one and tautomers thereof (collectively referred to herein as “Compound 1”) are disclosed in U.S. Pat.

In certain embodiments, a crystal form of a substance may be physically and/or chemically pure. In certain embodiments, a crystal form of a substance may be about 99%, about 98%, about 97%, about 96%, about 95%, about 94%, about 93%, about 92%, about 91%, or about 90% physically and/or chemically pure. Unless otherwise specified, the terms “polymorph,” “polymorphic form,” “polymorphs,” “polymorphic forms,” and related terms herein refer to two or more crystal forms that consist essentially of the same molecule, molecules or ions. Different polymorphs may have different physical properties, such as, for example, melting temperatures, heats of fusion, solubilities, dissolution rates, and/or vibrational spectra as a result of a different arrangement or conformation of the molecules or ions in the crystal lattice. The differences in physical properties exhibited by polymorphs may affect pharmaceutical parameters, such as storage stability, compressibility and density (important in formulation and product manufacturing), and dissolution rate (an important factor in bioavailability). Differences in stability can result from changes in chemical reactivity (e.g., differential oxidation, such that a dosage form discolors more rapidly when comprised of one polymorph than when comprised of another polymorph) or mechanical changes (e.g., tablets crumble on storage as a kinetically favored polymorph converts to thermodynamically a more stable polymorph) or both (e.g., tablets of one polymorph are more susceptible to breakdown at high humidity). As a result of solubility/dissolution differences, in the extreme case, some polymorphic transitions may result in lack of potency or, at the other extreme, toxicity. In addition, the physical properties of the crystal may be important in processing; for example, one polymorph might be more likely to form solvates or might be difficult to filter and wash free of impurities (e.g., particle shape and size distribution might be different between polymorphs). Unless otherwise specified, the term “cocrystal” as used herein, refers to a crystalline material comprised of Compound 1, including tautomers thereof, and one or more non-volative compounds bound together in a crystal lattice by non-covalent interactions. Unless otherwise specified, the term “amorphous” or “amorphous form” means that the substance, component, or product in question is not substantially crystalline as determined by X-ray diffraction. In particular, the term “amorphous form” describes a disordered solid form, i.e., a solid form lacking long range crystalline order. In certain embodiments, an amorphous form of a substance may be substantially free of other amorphous forms and/or crystal forms. In certain embodiments, an amorphous form of a substance may contain less than about 1%, less than about 2%, less than about 3%, less than about 4%, less than about 5%, less than about 10%, less than about 15%, less than about 20%, less than about 25%, less than about 30%, less than about 35%, less than about 40%, less than about 45%, or less than about 50% by weight of one or more other amorphous forms and/or crystal forms on a weight basis. In certain embodiments, an amorphous form of a substance may be physically and/or chemically pure. In certain embodiments, an amorphous form of a substance be about 99%, about 98%, about 97%, about 96%, about 95%, about 94%, about 93%, about 92%, about 91%, or about 90% physically and/or chemically pure. “Treating” as used herein, means an alleviation, in whole or in part, of the disease or disorder, or symptoms associated with the disease or disorder, or slowing, or halting of further progression or worsening of the disease or disorder, or symptoms associated with the disease or disorder. “Preventing” as used herein, means prevention of the onset, recurrence, or spread of the disease or disorder, or symptoms associated with the disorder or disease, in a patient at risk for developing the disease or disorder. The term “effective amount” in connection with a solid form of Compound 1 means, in one embodiment, an amount capable of alleviating, in whole or in part, symptoms associated with a disorder or disease, or slowing or halting further progression or worsening of those symptoms, or, in another embodiment, an amount capable of preventing or providing prophylaxis for the disease or disorder in a subject at risk for developing the disease or disorder as disclosed herein, such as cancer. In one embodiment, an effective amount of a solid form of Compound 1 is an amount that inhibits a kinase in a cell, such as, for example, in vitro or in vivo. In one embodiment the kinase is mTOR, DNA-PK, PI3K or a combination thereof. In some embodiments, the effective amount of a solid form of Compound 1 inhibits the kinase in a cell by 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or 99%, compared to the activity of the kinase in an untreated cell. The effective amount of a solid form of Compound 1, for example in a pharmaceutical composition, may be at a level that will exercise the desired effect; for example, about 0.005 mg/kg of a subject's body weight to about 100 mg/kg of a patient's body weight in unit dosage for both oral and parenteral administration. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, it is to be expected that the effective amount of a solid form of Compound 1 disclosed herein may vary depending on the indication being treated, e.g., the effective amount of a solid form of Compound 1 would likely be different for treating patients suffering from, or at risk for, inflammatory conditions relative to the effective amount of a solid form of Compound 1 for treating patients suffering from, or at risk of, a different disorder, e.g., cancer or a metabolic disorder. “Patient” or “subject” is defined herein to include animals, such as mammals, including, but not limited to, primates (e.g., humans), cows, sheep, goats, horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, rats, mice, monkeys, chickens, turkeys, quails, or guinea pigs and the like. In specific embodiments, the patient or subject is a human. The term “cancer” refers to any of various malignant neoplasms characterized by the proliferation of cells that can invade surrounding tissue and metastasize to new body sites. Both benign and malignant tumors are classified according to the type of tissue in which they are found. For example, fibromas are neoplasms of fibrous connective tissue, and melanomas are abnormal growths of pigment (melanin) cells. Malignant tumors originating from epithelial tissue, e.g., in skin, bronchi, and stomach, are termed carcinomas. Malignancies of epithelial glandular tissue such as are found in the breast, prostate, and colon, are known as adenocarcinomas. Malignant growths of connective tissue, e.g., muscle, cartilage, lymph tissue, and bone, are called sarcomas. Lymphomas and leukemias are malignancies arising among white blood cells. Through the process of metastasis, tumor cell migration to other areas of the body establishes neoplasms in areas away from the site of initial appearance. Bone tissues are one of the most favored sites of metastases of malignant tumors, occurring in about 30% of all cancer cases. Among malignant tumors, cancers of the lung, breast, prostate or the like are particularly known to be likely to metastasize to bone. In the context of neoplasm, cancer, tumor growth or tumor cell growth, inhibition may be assessed by delayed appearance of primary or secondary tumors, slowed development of primary or secondary tumors, decreased occurrence of primary or secondary tumors, slowed or decreased severity of secondary effects of disease, arrested tumor growth and regression of tumors, among others. In the extreme, complete inhibition, is referred to herein as prevention or chemoprevention. In this context, the term “prevention” includes either preventing the onset of clinically evident neoplasia altogether or preventing the onset of a preclinically evident stage of neoplasia in individuals at risk. Also intended to be encompassed by this definition is the prevention of transformation into malignant cells or to arrest or reverse the progression of premalignant cells to malignant cells. This includes prophylactic treatment of those at risk of developing the neoplasia. In certain embodiments, the treatment of lymphoma may be assessed by the International Workshop Criteria (IWC) for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (see Cheson B D, Pfistner B, Juweid, M E, et. al.

In one embodiment, the end point for lymphoma is evidence of clinical benefit. Clinical benefit may reflect improvement in quality of life, or reduction in patient symptoms, transfusion requirements, frequent infections, or other parameters. Time to reappearance or progression of lymphoma-related symptoms can also be used in this end point. In certain embodiments, the treatment of CLL may be assessed by the International Workshop Guidelines for CLL (see Hallek M, Cheson B D, Catovsky D, et al. Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a report from the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia updating the National Cancer Institute-Working Group 1996 guidelines. Blood, 2008; (111) 12: 5446-5456) using the response and endpoint definitions shown therein and in particular: Parameter CR PR PD Group A Lymphadenopathy† None >1.5 cm Decrease ≧50% Increase ≧50% Hepatomegaly None Decrease ≧50% Increase ≧50% Splenomegaly None Decrease ≧50% Increase ≧50% Blood lymphocytes <4000/μL Decrease ≧50% Increase ≧50% over from baseline baseline Marrow‡ Normocellular, <30% 50% reduction in lymphocytes, no B- marrow infiltrate, or lymphoid nodules.

CR (complete remission): all of the criteria have to be met, and patients have to lack disease-related constitutional symptoms; PR (partial remission): at least two of the criteria of group A plus one of the criteria of group B have to be met; SD is absence of progressive disease (PD) and failure to achieve at least a PR; PD: at least one of the above criteria of group A or group B has to be met. Sum of the products of multiple lymph nodes (as evaluated by CT scans in clinical trials, or by physical examination in general practice). These parameters are irrelevant for some response categories. In certain embodiments, the treatment of multiple myeloma may be assessed by the International Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma (IURC) (see Durie B G M, Harousseau J-L, Miguel J S, et al. International uniform response criteria for multiple myeloma. Leukemia, 2006; (10) 10: 1-7), using the response and endpoint definitions shown below: Response Subcategory Response Criteriaa sCR CR as defined below plus Normal FLC ratio and Absence of clonal cells in bone marrowb by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescencec CR Negative immunofixation on the serum and urine and Disappearance of any soft tissue plasmacytomas and <5% plasma cells in bone marrowb VGPR Serum and urine M-protein detectable by immunofixation but not on electrophoresis or 90% or greater reduction in serum M-protein plus urine M-protein level <100 mg per 24 h PR ≧50% reduction of serum M-protein and reduction in 24-h urinary M-protein by≧90% or to <200 mg per 24 h If the serum and urine M-protein are unmeasurable,d a ≧50% decrease in the difference between involved and uninvolved FLC levels is required in place of the M- protein criteria If serum and urine M-protein are unmeasurable, and serum free light assay is also unmeasurable, ≧50% reduction in plasma cells is required in place of M-protein, provided baseline bone marrow plasma cell percentage was ≧30% In addition to the above listed criteria, if present at baseline, a ≧50% reduction in the size of soft tissue plasmacytomas is also required SD (not recommended for use as an Not meeting criteria for CR, VGPR, PR or progressive indicator of response; stability of disease disease is best described by providing the time to progression estimates) Abbreviations: CR, complete response; FLC, free light chain; PR, partial response; SD, stable disease; sCR, stringent complete response; VGPR, very good partial response; aAll response categories require two consecutive assessments made at anytime before the institution of any new therapy; all categories also require no known evidence of progressive or new bone lesions if radiographic studies were performed. Radiographic studies are not required to satisfy these response requirements; bConfirmation with repeat bone marrow biopsy not needed; cPresence/absence of clonal cells is based upon the κ/λ ratio. An abnormal κ/λ ratio by immunohistochemistry and/or immunofluorescence requires a minimum of 100 plasma cells for analysis. An abnormal ratio reflecting presence of an abnormal clone is κ/λ of >4:1 or <1:2. dMeasurable disease defined by at least one of the following measurements: Bone marrow plasma cells ≧30%; Serum M-protein ≧1 g/dl (≧10 gm/l)[10 g/l]; Urine M-protein ≧200 mg/24 h; Serum FLC assay: Involved FLC level ≧10 mg/dl (≧100 mg/l); provided serum FLC ratio is abnormal. In certain embodiments, the treatment of a cancer may be assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1) (see Thereasse P., et al. New Guidelines to Evaluate the Response to Treatment in Solid Tumors. J. of the National Cancer Institute; 2000; (92) 205-216 and Eisenhauer E. A., Therasse P., Bogaerts J., et al. New response evaluation criteria in solid tumours: Revised RECIST guideline (version 1.1). European J. Cancer; 2009; (45) 228-247). Overall responses for all possible combinations of tumor responses in target and non-target lesions with our without the appearance of new lesions are as follows: Target lesions Non-target lesions New lesions Overall response CR CR No CR CR Incomplete No PR response/SD PR Non-PD No PR SD Non-PD No SD PD Any Yes or no PD Any PD Yes or no PD Any Any Yes PD CR = complete response; PR = partial response; SD = stable disease; and PD = progressive disease. With respect to the evaluation of target lesions, complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all target lesions, partial response (PR) is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum longest diameter, progressive disease (PD) is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions and stable disease (SD) is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, taking as reference the smallest sum longest diameter since the treatment started. With respect to the evaluation of non-target lesions, complete response (CR) is the disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level; incomplete response/stable disease (SD) is the persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or the maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits, and progressive disease (PD) is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. The procedures, conventions, and definitions described below provide guidance for implementing the recommendations from the Response Assessment for Neuro-Oncology (RANO) Working Group regarding response criteria for high-grade gliomas (Wen P., Macdonald, D R., Reardon, D A., et al. Updated response assessment criteria for highgrade gliomas: Response assessment in neuro-oncology working group. J Clin Oncol 2010; 28: 1963-1972). Primary modifications to the RANO criteria for Criteria for Time Point Responses (TPR) can include the addition of operational conventions for defining changes in glucocorticoid dose, and the removal of subjects' clinical deterioration component to focus on objective radiologic assessments. The baseline MRI scan is defined as the assessment performed at the end of the post-surgery rest period, prior to re-initiating compound treatment. The baseline MRI is used as the reference for assessing complete response (CR) and partial response (PR). Whereas, the smallest SPD (sum of the products of perpendicular diameters) obtained either at baseline or at subsequent assessments will be designated the nadir assessment and utilized as the reference for determining progression. For the 5 days preceding any protocol-defined MRI scan, subjects receive either no glucocorticoids or are on a stable dose of glucocorticoids. A stable dose is defined as the same daily dose for the 5 consecutive days preceding the MRI scan. If the prescribed glucocorticoid dose is changed in the 5 days before the baseline scan, a new baseline scan is required with glucocorticoid use meeting the criteria described above. The following definitions will be used. Measurable Lesions: Measurable lesions are contrast-enhancing lesions that can be measured bidimensionally. A measurement is made of the maximal enhancing tumor diameter (also known as the longest diameter, LD). The greatest perpendicular diameter is measured on the same image. The cross hairs of bidimensional measurements should cross and the product of these diameters will be calculated. Minimal Diameter: T1-weighted image in which the sections are 5 mm with 1 mm skip. The minimal LD of a measurable lesion is set as 5 mm by 5 mm. Larger diameters may be required for inclusion and/or designation as target lesions. After baseline, target lesions that become smaller than the minimum requirement for measurement or become no longer amenable to bidimensional measurement will be recorded at the default value of 5 mm for each diameter below 5 mm. Lesions that disappear will be recorded as 0 mm by 0 mm. Multicentric Lesions: Lesions that are considered multicentric (as opposed to continuous) are lesions where there is normal intervening brain tissue between the two (or more) lesions. For multicentric lesions that are discrete foci of enhancement, the approach is to separately measure each enhancing lesion that meets the inclusion criteria. If there is no normal brain tissue between two (or more) lesions, they will be considered the same lesion. Nonmeasurable Lesions: All lesions that do not meet the criteria for measurable disease as defined above will be considered non-measurable lesions, as well as all nonenhancing and other truly nonmeasurable lesions. Nonmeasurable lesions include foci of enhancement that are less than the specified smallest diameter (ie., less than 5 mm by 5 mm), nonenhancing lesions (eg., as seen on T1-weighted post-contrast, T2-weighted, or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images), hemorrhagic or predominantly cystic or necrotic lesions, and leptomeningeal tumor. Hemorrhagic lesions often have intrinsic T1-weighted hyperintensity that could be misinterpreted as enhancing tumor, and for this reason, the pre-contrast T1-weighted image may be examined to exclude baseline or interval sub-acute hemorrhage. At baseline, lesions will be classified as follows: Target lesions: Up to 5 measurable lesions can be selected as target lesions with each measuring at least 10 mm by 5 mm, representative of the subject's disease; Non-target lesions: All other lesions, including all nonmeasurable lesions (including mass effects and T2/FLAIR findings) and any measurable lesion not selected as a target lesion. At baseline, target lesions are to be measured as described in the definition for measurable lesions and the SPD of all target lesions is to be determined. The presence of all other lesions is to be documented. At all post-treatment evaluations, the baseline classification of lesions as target and non-target lesions will be maintained and lesions will be documented and described in a consistent fashion over time (eg., recorded in the same order on source documents and eCRFs). All measurable and nonmeasurable lesions must be assessed using the same technique as at baseline (e.g., subjects should be imaged on the same MRI scanner or at least with the same magnet strength) for the duration of the study to reduce difficulties in interpreting changes. At each evaluation, target lesions will be measured and the SPD calculated. Non-target lesions will be assessed qualitatively and new lesions, if any, will be documented separately. At each evaluation, a time point response will be determined for target lesions, non-target lesions, and new lesion. Tumor progression can be established even if only a subset of lesions is assessed. However, unless progression is observed, objective status (stable disease, PR or CR) can only be determined when all lesions are assessed. Confirmation assessments for overall time point responses of CR and PR will be performed at the next scheduled assessment, but confirmation may not occur if scans have an interval of <28 days. Best response, incorporating confirmation requirements, will be derived from the series of time points. In certain embodiments, treatment of a cancer may be assessed by the inhibition of phosphorylation of S6RP, 4E-BP1, AKT and/or DNA-PK in circulating blood and/or tumor cells, and/or skin biopsies or tumor biopsies/aspirates, before, during and/or after treatment with a TOR kinase inhibitor. For example, the inhibition of phosphorylation of S6RP, 4E-BP1, AKT and/or DNA-PK is assessed in B-cells, T-cells and/or monocytes. In other embodiments, treatment of a cancer may be assessed by the inhibition of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) activity in skin samples and/or tumor biopsies/aspirates, such as by assessment of the amount of pDNA-PK 52056 as a biomarker for DNA damage pathways, before, during, and/or after TOR kinase inhibitor treatment. In one embodiment, the skin sample is irradiated by UV light. In the extreme, complete inhibition, is referred to herein as prevention or chemoprevention. In this context, the term “prevention” includes either preventing the onset of clinically evident cancer altogether or preventing the onset of a preclinically evident stage of a cancer. Also intended to be encompassed by this definition is the prevention of transformation into malignant cells or to arrest or reverse the progression of premalignant cells to malignant cells. This includes prophylactic treatment of those at risk of developing a cancer. Unless otherwise specified, to the extent that there is a discrepancy between a depicted chemical structure of a compound provided herein and a chemical name of a compound provided herein, the chemical structure shall control. 5.2 Compound 1 The solid forms, formulations and methods of use provided herein relate to solid forms (e.g., cocrystals) of Compound 1: having the name 1-ethyl-7-(2-methyl-6-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-3-yl)pyridin-3-yl)-3,4-dihydropyrazino[2,3-b]pyrazin-2(1H)-one, including tautomers thereof.

The plates were mounted on a Bruker GADDS diffractometer equipped with a Hi-Star area detector. The XRPD platform was calibrated using Silver Behenate for the long d-spacings and Corundum for the short d-spacings. Data collection was carried out at room temperature using monochromatic CuKα radiation in the 2θ region between 1.5° and 41.5°, which is the most distinctive part of the XRPD pattern. The diffraction pattern of each well was collected in two 2θ ranges (1.5°≦2θ≦21.5° for the first frame, and 19.5°≦2θ≦41.5° for the second frame) with an exposure time of 90 s for each frame. No background subtraction or curve smoothing was applied to the XRPD patterns. The carrier material used during XRPD analysis was transparent to X-rays and contributed only slightly to the background. DSC analyses were performed on a DSC822e instrument (Mettler-Toledo GmbH, Switzerland). The DSC822e was calibrated for temperature and enthalpy with a small piece of indium (m.p. is 156.6° C.; ΔHf is 28.45 J/g). Samples were sealed in standard 40 μl aluminum pans, pin-holed and heated in the DSC from 25° C. to 300° C., at a heating rate of 10° C./min. Dry N2 gas, at a flow rate of 50 ml/min was used to purge the DSC equipment during measurement. The cycling DSC's were measured in standard 40 μl aluminum pans, pin-holed and heated in the DSC from 25° C. to 190° C., then cooled back to 25° C. The heating and cooling rate was 10° C./min. Dry N2 gas, at a flow rate of 50 ml/min was used to purge the DSC equipment during measurement. TGA/SDTA analysis was adopted to determine mass loss caused by solvent or water loss from crystals. Monitoring the sample weight, during heating in a TGA/SDTA851e instrument (Mettler-Toledo GmbH, Switzerland), results in a weight vs. temperature curve. The TGA/SDTA851e was calibrated for temperature with indium and aluminum. Samples were weighed into 100 μL aluminum crucibles and sealed. The seals were pin-holed and the crucibles heated in the TGA from 25° C. to 300° C. at a heating rate of 10° C./min. Dry N2 gas was used for purging. The gases evolved from the TGA samples were analyzed by a mass spectrometer Omnistar GSD 301 T2 (Pfeiffer Vacuum GmbH, Germany). The latter is a quadrupole mass spectrometer, which analyses masses in the range of 0-200 amu. Digital images were automatically collected for all the wells of each well-plate, employing a Philips PCVC 840K CCD camera controlled by Crystallics Photoslider software. FTIR spectra were recorded on a ThermoFischer Scientific FT-IR: Nicolet 6700. Morphology analysis of the samples was carried out on an Olympus microscope. Small amounts of samples were dispersed in mineral oil on a glass slide with cover slips and viewed with 20× or 50× magnification. Hygroscopicity was determined on a Surface Measurement Systems DVS. Typically a sample size of 2-10 mg was loaded into the DVS instrument sample pan and the sample was analyzed on a DVS automated sorption analyzer at room temperature. The relative humidity was increased from 0% to 90% RH at 10% RH step then 95% RH. The relative humidity was then decreased in a similar manner to accomplish a full adsorption/desorption cycle. For selected hydrated forms, the analysis started at 50% RH and increased to 90% RH at 10% RH step. The relative humidity was then decreased in a similar manner to 0% RH followed by increasing to 50% RH. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was performed according to the conditions in Table 1 and gradient program in Table 2.

Crystal16® multiple-reactor system (Avantium Technologies) holds 16 (4×4) standard HPLC glass vials (11.5 mm diameter, flat bottomed, 1.8 mL volume). A unit consists of four independently heated aluminum reactor blocks encased in a robust bench top setup. These blocks are electrically heated and cooled by a combination of Peltier elements and a cryostat. In order to prevent condensation of water on the reactor blocks and electronics during runs at temperatures below 10° C., the Crystal16® system provides an inlet for a dry purge gas (typically nitrogen).

Based on the chemical structure of Compound 1, 15 different coformers were selected (Table 5). The cocrystal formation experiments were performed as described in §6.3. Physical stability of all samples was studied by exposing all solids to accelerated ageing conditions (40° C./75% RH for 48 hours) followed by re-analysis by XRPD and digital imaging. After exposure to accelerated ageing conditions, all solids were re-classified on the basis of their new XRPD patterns. The assignment of solid forms was primarily based on the XRPD analysis. The cocrystals formed with Benzoic acid (Form 1), Fumaric acid (Form 2 and Form 3), Gentisic acid (Form 4 and Form 5), Nicotinamide (Form 6) and Succinic acid (Form 7) appear to be stable at accelerated aging conditions (40° C. and 75% RH). However, the cocrystals show a relatively high content of an impurity. The impurity was determined either by FT-IR or HPLC. The cocrystal with maleic acid (Form 8) was stable after exposure to accelerated ageing conditions for (40° C./75% RH for 48 hours) and confirmed by TGMS, FTIR and HPLC analysis. Concluding remarks per analysis of these solids are given in Table 4.

Both HPLC and FT-IR indicated the presence of an impurity with retention time of 4.54 minutes. Nevertheless the FT-IR spectrum indicated that Compound 1 forms cocrystals with benzoic acid. Form 2 and Form 3 are two cocrystal solid forms of Compound 1 with fumaric acid. Form 2 is a hydrate and Form 3 is a mixed hydrate/solvate with methanol. Apparently both Form 2 and Form 3 undergo desolvation and melt at a temperature around 177° C. The FT-IR spectra of Form 2 and Form 3 indicated that Compound 1 forms cocrystals with fumaric acid, although impurities were more visible in the Form 2 spectra. Nevertheless, the HPLC data of Form 2 indicates the existence of the impurity with retention time 4.54 minutes. Form 4 and Form 5 are two cocrystal solid forms of Compound 1 with gentisic acid. FT-IR spectrum confirms cocrystallization for both Form 4 and Form 5. Nevertheless, Form 5 seems to contain impurity based on both HPLC and FT-IR analysis. On the other hand Form 4 is a chemically pure material, but SDTA signal of Form 4 shows that Form 4 may undergo through several solid state transformations during the SDTA analysis. Form 4 first desolvates and the process is followed by another series of endothermic events. Also the coformer alone was observed in the SDTA signal of Form 4. Form 6 is a cocrystal formed by Compound 1 with nicotinamide and seems to be a mixed solvate/hydrate with THF. Form 6 first desolvates at a temperature around 115° C., followed by melt event at 134° C. and decomposition starting with 200° C. Although HPLC data shows a high sample purity, some traces of impurity were detected by FT-IR. Form 7 is a cocrystal formed by Compound 1 with succinic acid which desolvates at 108° C. and melts at 163° C. Degradation of the cocrystal takes place at 200° C. and the melting event of the free base was observed at around 260° C. The FT-IR spectra confirms the co-crystallization of Compound 1 with succinic acid. Nevertheless, the impurity with a retention time of 4.54 minutes was also observed in samples. Form 8 is a cocrystal formed by Compound 1 with maleic acid. The SDTA signal shows that Form 8 dehydrates and melts at around 120° C. followed by immediate decomposition. The FT-IT spectrum confirms the cocrystal formation of Compound 1 with maleic acid. Purity of Form 8 sample was assessed as 100%(area) by HPLC. Almost all the investigated cocrystals (Form 1, Form 2, Form 3, Form 4, Form 5, Form 6 and Form 7) with the exception of Form 8 show multiple endothermic events by the SDTA signal suggesting their solvated/hydrated nature and also possible solid-state phase transformations that may take place at molecular level. TGMS analysis of all the cocrystals (Form 1, Form 2, Form 3, Form 4, Form 5, Form 6, Form 7 and Form 8) reveal that these cocrystals are solvated and/or hydrated. Form 8 has a melting point above 120° C. but significantly lower than Compound 1 free base and therefore it might be an indication of a higher solubility of this cocrystal over that of the free base. HPLC analysis of Form 1, Form 2, Form 5 and Form 7 show the presence of an impurity with a retention time of 4.54 minutes. The FT-IR spectra of Form 1, Form 2, Form 3, Form 4, Form 5, Form 6, Form 7 and Form 8 clearly show significant changes in the shifts at around 1800-1400 cm−1 indicating the interaction of co-former molecules with the nitrogens of Compound 1. On the basis of the results presented above, it is possible to make co-crystals of Compound 1 with both aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids (e.g., fumaric, maleic, succinic, benzoic and gentisic acid) as well as with amides (e.g., nicotinamides). 6.3 Experimental Methods In total, 316 experiments were performed, including 124 cooling evaporative experiments, 64 slurry experiments, 64 powder in saturated solution experiments and 64 grinding experiments. In all methods, 4 solvents (see Table 6) and 15 coformers were tested (see Table 5), including 4 blank experiments per method. The coformers and the solvents used were the same for all four methods. The coformers have been selected on the basis of their H-bonding capability, diversity, pharmaceutical acceptability and solubility in the proposed solvents. An overview of the combination of methods and solvents used is provided in Table 5 and Table 6. The solvents used in the polymorph screen were either HPLC or reagent grade.

Compound 1 free base (the starting material) and coformers were solid dosed in 1.8 mL experimental vials. A suitable volume of solvent was added to reach a close-to saturated solution. Following, the HPLC vials were capped and placed in the Crystal16® system to undergo the temperature profile as described in Table 7. Also 4 control experiments were performed. At the end of the temperature profile, the solids were separated from the liquids, dried and analyzed by XRPD and digital imaging. The mother liquids after separation of solids were evaporated and the remaining solids analyzed by XRPD and digital imaging too. Subsequently, all solids were placed in a climate chamber at 40° C. and 75% RH for 48 hours and again analyzed by XRPD and digital imaging.

In each solvent, saturated solutions of Compound 1 were prepared. To the saturated solutions the solid coformers were added until the coformer did not dissolve anymore or precipitation occurred. The samples remained for 4 hours at ambient temperature, while stirring. In addition, 6 control experiments were performed. Subsequently, the solids were separated from the liquids.
