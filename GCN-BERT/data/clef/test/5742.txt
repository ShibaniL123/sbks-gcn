Example 1: N-(2-((2-(dimethylamino)ethyl)(methyl)amino)-4-methoxy-5-(4-(3-methyl-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)pyrimidin-2-ylamino)phenyl)acrylamide hydrochloride
Step 1: N1-(2-chloropyrimidin-4-yl)benzene-1,2-diamine
O-phenylenediamine (3.24 g, 30 mmol) and 2,4-dichloropyrimidine (4.47 g, 30 mmol) were dispersed in anhydrous ethanol (60 mL), and diisopropylethylamine (7.74 g, 60 mmol) was added thereto and the resulting mixture was heated to reflux for 3 hours. The resulting mixture was concentrated under vacuum to remove the solvent, and the residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (100 mL), washed with water and then saturated brine, and concentrated under vacuum to remove the solvent. The resulting residue was separated by column chromatography (EA: PE = 1: 2) to give the title compound (5.32 g, 80%).
